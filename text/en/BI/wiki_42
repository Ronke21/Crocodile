<text>Robert Bernard Fowler (born 9 April 1975) is an English football coach and former player. He most recently managed Saudi First Division League side Al-Qadsiah.

As a player, he was a striker, and is the ninth-highest goalscorer in the history of the Premier League. He is best known for his time at Liverpool, initially from 1993 to 2001. He scored 183 goals in total for Liverpool, earning the nickname &quot;God&quot; from the Anfield fans, and he is Liverpool&#x27;s second-top scorer in the Premier League. He subsequently played for Leeds United and Manchester City, before returning to Liverpool in January 2006. He moved to Cardiff City eighteen months later. He played there for a year before transferring to Blackburn Rovers on a short-term deal. In December 2008, he departed Blackburn and played in Australia with North Queensland Fury and Perth Glory. In 2011, he joined Thai side Muangthong United as a player, but later was appointed player-manager, which he remained until his retirement in 2012.

Fowler was capped for England 26 times, scoring 7 goals. He was included in England&#x27;s squads for Euro 1996, Euro 2000 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup. 
== Early life ==
Fowler was born in Toxteth, Liverpool, and brought up in the inner city area of Liverpool. At this time he was known as Robert Ryder, his mother&#x27;s surname. He lived in Toxteth at the time of the 1981 Toxteth riots, when he was six years old. As a youngster he supported Everton F.C. and regularly attended home and away games. He played regularly for schoolboy team Thorvald, and once scored 16 times in a 26–0 rout.

== Club career ==
=== Liverpool ===
Despite growing up as an Everton fan, Fowler&#x27;s career began with Liverpool. He signed as a youth team player on leaving school in the summer of 1991, signing professional terms on his 17th birthday, 9 April 1992.

Fowler&#x27;s first involvement with the Liverpool first team came on 13 January 1993, when he was an unused substitute in an FA Cup third round tie against Bolton Wanderers. In the following close season, Fowler helped the England under-18 team win the 1993 European Championship, before making a scoring first-team debut in Liverpool&#x27;s 3–1 win in a second round League Cup tie at Fulham on 22 September 1993. Fowler scored all five goals in the second leg at Anfield two weeks later, making him the fourth player in Liverpool&#x27;s history to score five in a senior fixture. He scored his first league hat-trick against Southampton on 30 October 1993 in only his fifth league game. His very first league goal for the Reds had come on 16 October 1993, when an 87th-minute equaliser at home to struggling Oldham Athletic saved the Reds from what would have been one of the biggest Premier League shocks of the season, with a last gasp own goal giving Liverpool a 2–1 win. He scored twice in a 3–3 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on 18 December 1993.

His first 13 games for the club yielded 12 goals, and he was rewarded with an England Under-21 debut against San Marino in November 1993, in which he scored England&#x27;s opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio throughout the season, but finished his first season as the club&#x27;s second top scorer with 18 goals in all competitions, Ian Rush had scored 19. It was, however, a disappointing season for Liverpool, as they finished eighth in the Premier League without making an impact in any of the major competitions, though the departure of Graeme Souness as manager and the appointment of Roy Evans as successor built up hope for a brighter future at Anfield after the disappointment of the first two FA Premier League seasons.

==== Success and fame ====
During the 1994–95 season Fowler was a constant member of the Liverpool side, playing in all of their 57 competitive matches, including the victory in the 1995 League Cup final, and a match against Arsenal on 28 August 1994 in which he scored what was then the Premier League&#x27;s fastest hat-trick ever, in four minutes and 33 seconds. His record stood for twenty years until broken by Sadio Mané on 16 May 2015 for Southampton against Aston Villa, who scored three goals in two minutes and 56 seconds. He scored braces against Aston Villa, Ipswich Town, Chelsea and Norwich City in the league that season. Fowler was voted the PFA Young Player of the Year in two consecutive years in 1995 and 1996, a feat also achieved only by Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney and Dele Alli.

Throughout the mid and late 1990s, Fowler was widely considered to be the most natural finisher playing in England. Fowler sealed this reputation as he scored more than 30 goals for three consecutive seasons, up to 1997. He remains the only player to have scored 30 plus goals in his first three full seasons in England scoring 98 goals with a total of 116 in just over three years. Fowler&#x27;s partnership with Steve McManaman was largely described as the reason why Liverpool had become the club known for being the most potent attacking force in England at the time, and Fowler was renowned for scoring goals of all varieties, from every angle and distance, with McManaman describing him as the &quot;greatest goalscorer of all time&quot;.

Stan Collymore, Fowler&#x27;s regular strike partner for two seasons from 1995, said in his autobiography that Fowler was the best player he has ever played alongside. Fowler and Collymore were among the most prolific goal-scoring strike partnerships in England during the 1995–96 season, with £8.4million signing Collymore replacing the veteran Ian Rush as Fowler&#x27;s regular partner in attack after his arrival in June 1995. In the same season, he scored twice in a 4–3 victory over Newcastle United, a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but it was not enough for Liverpool to clinch the title; they finished third while Manchester United were crowned champions. Fowler also played in his first FA Cup Final that season, but was on the losing side as Manchester United won 1–0. He had scored four goals against United in the league that season, scoring twice in a 2–2 draw at Old Trafford on 1 October 1995, and twice in a 2–0 win at Anfield on 16 December.

On 14 December 1996, he scored four against Middlesbrough, including his hundredth for Liverpool. This meant he reached a century of goals one game quicker than his first strike partner, Ian Rush, in just 165 games. That year, he also won a UEFA Fair Play award for denying that he had been fouled by Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman at Highbury after a penalty had been given. After unsuccessfully trying to persuade the referee to change his decision about the penalty, Fowler took it tamely and Seaman saved. However, Seaman failed to hold on to the ball and Jason McAteer scored from the rebound. Although many people believe that he deliberately took the penalty kick poorly for reasons of fair play, Fowler said at the time: &quot;As a goalscorer it&#x27;s part of my job to take it and I wanted to score it. I tried to score. I never missed on purpose. It just happened, it was a bad penalty.&quot;

==== Spice Boys ====
Fowler was part of a group of Liverpool players from the mid-1990s who were dubbed &quot;The Spice Boys&quot; by the press following a series of off-field controversies. The term was subsequently used in a derogatory manner, implying Fowler and colleagues such as Jamie Redknapp, Stan Collymore, David James and Steve McManaman were underachieving playboys. The name had been coined due to rumours that Fowler was dating Emma Bunton of the Spice Girls. Fowler said that his successful career to that point had been &quot;dismissed with contempt by those two tiny words&quot;.

Liverpool were top of the Premier League by Christmas 1996, with three defeats in the first half of the season. By the end of January, they had been leapfrogged by Manchester United, who remained top for the rest of the season, while Liverpool finished 4th.

Fowler showed support for the Liverpool dockers&#x27; strike during a goal celebration in a UEFA Cup games against SK Brann in March 1997 where he unveiled a t-shirt which incorporated the Calvin Klein &quot;CK&quot; into the word doCKer. He was fined £900 by UEFA and criticised by manager Roy Evans for the gesture.

Fowler&#x27;s performance in the 1997–98 football season was marred by an anterior cruciate (knee) ligament injury that kept him out of action for half of the season and caused him to miss the 1998 World Cup. During this period of injury, fellow Liverpool striker, Michael Owen rose to prominence, making his debut in 1997. Owen established himself in the Liverpool team in Fowler&#x27;s absence and played alongside him when Fowler regained his fitness.

In 1999, Fowler was fined £60,000 by his club for bringing the game into disrepute. While celebrating his goal against Liverpool&#x27;s Merseyside rivals, Everton, Fowler used the white line of the penalty area to simulate cocaine use. Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier stated that this was a Cameroonian grass-eating celebration, learnt from teammate Rigobert Song. Defending himself, Fowler later said this was a response to Everton fans who had insulted him with false accusations of drug abuse. Fowler received a six-match ban from the FA in April 1999, with four matches for this celebration. Fowler also received a two-match suspension for making alleged homophobic gestures towards Chelsea&#x27;s Graeme Le Saux.

==== Winning the cup treble ====
The 2000–01 season was Fowler&#x27;s most successful season. He scored 17 goals, appeared in three finals, and lifted three trophies in a unique cup treble. In the absence of Jamie Redknapp, who was sidelined by injury, Fowler was named as Liverpool captain when he started. However he found himself the third-choice Liverpool striker, with Houllier favouring a forward partnership of Michael Owen and Emile Heskey.

He took part in a fourth-round League Cup hammering of Stoke City, scoring a hat-trick in an 8–0 victory, which was second only to the club&#x27;s biggest ever win in 1986 – a 10–0 defeat of Fulham. In the League Cup final against Birmingham City, the club&#x27;s first cup final since 1996, he captained the side and scored in the 30th minute. Liverpool went on to win the trophy on penalties, with Fowler scoring Liverpool&#x27;s fifth in the shootout. Fowler picked up the Alan Hardaker Man of the Match award and lifted the trophy.

Fowler&#x27;s season picked up from there as he scored several important goals including one against runaway champions Manchester United and a free kick in the FA Cup semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers. Fowler featured as a substitute in the 2001 FA Cup Final coming on as a 77th-minute replacement for Vladimír Šmicer. Liverpool, who were 1–0 down at that point, eventually won the game 2–1 with two goals from Owen. Fowler raised the trophy along with Sami Hyypiä and Jamie Redknapp.

Four days later he was a substitute again in Liverpool&#x27;s third final, the 2001 UEFA Cup Final against Deportivo Alavés. He came on in the 64th minute for Heskey with the score at 3–3. He scored seven minutes later but Alavés equalised before full-time and Liverpool eventually won with a golden goal, an own goal, in the 116th minute. Fowler and Hyypiä then raised Liverpool&#x27;s third trophy of the season together. Liverpool&#x27;s next and final game of the season was against Charlton Athletic and Fowler scored twice in a 4–0 victory at The Valley that assured them UEFA Champions League qualification for the next season.

==== Liverpool departure ====
Fowler began the 2001–02 season controversially, after being dropped by Houllier from the Liverpool squad for the 2001 Charity Shield match. He made an appearance in Liverpool&#x27;s 3–2 European Super Cup victory over Bayern Munich, but starts were intermittent. In October 2001, he scored his first league hat-trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat Leicester City 4–1, but was dropped for the following league match. Though Fowler had been on a contract extension from 1999 (unlike Steve McManaman – who exercised his Bosman entitlement the very same year), Fowler was linked to Lazio, Arsenal and Leeds United, and Liverpool&#x27;s management as well as fans and the media constantly reported that what happened with McManaman (regarded as a huge financial loss) would never be repeated and thus the club never rejected those bids without consideration. This meant that coupled with Fowler&#x27;s relationship with Houllier, speculation over Fowler&#x27;s future persisted for most of Houllier&#x27;s tenure and became an issue that divided Liverpool fans. His last appearance for Liverpool was against Sunderland, in which he was substituted at half-time.

=== Leeds United ===
Despite his popularity with Liverpool fans, who referred to Fowler as &quot;God&quot;, Michael Owen and Emile Heskey had established themselves as Liverpool&#x27;s regular strike partnership, leaving Fowler on the fringes of the first team. This, along with his difficult relationship with Houllier, made him seek regular first-team football away from Anfield in the form of a £12 million move to Leeds United. Fowler maintains that Houllier forced him out of Liverpool, and accused Houllier of pressuring the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; newspaper to use its influence to turn opinion against him.

The transfer went ahead just one month after his hat-trick at Leicester. He made his Leeds debut in an away game against Fulham in December 2001, the same ground where he had made his Liverpool debut eight years earlier. Fowler scored 12 goals in the remainder of the season, helping Leeds to a UEFA Cup qualifying place. Fowler was included in the England squad for the 2002 World Cup, but only made one appearance, coming on as a substitute in a second-round win over Denmark.

Fowler suffered an aggravation of a pre-existing hip injury in the 2002–03 pre-season, and did not recover until December. Struggling to gain fitness, and seeing teammates sold off due to a financial crisis, Fowler&#x27;s form and market value diminished. It was despite this decrease in form that he still, in total, scored 15 goals in 31 appearances for Leeds; achieving an impressive strike rate of just less than one goal every two games. In 2002–03, Leeds finished 15th in the Premier League and a severe financial crisis was developing.

=== Manchester City ===
In the 2002–03 season, Fowler was transferred to Manchester City following a protracted transfer saga. Fowler initially turned down the move and a dispute between Manchester City manager Kevin Keegan and chairman David Bernstein over whether the transfer should take place due to medical concerns resulted in Bernstein leaving the club. Following encouragement from Keegan, Fowler finally signed for Manchester City on 16 January 2003 for an initial fee of £3 million and a further £3 million dependent upon appearances. Bizarre transfer conditions meant Leeds United still paid a significant proportion of Fowler&#x27;s wages. Fowler made his Manchester City debut against West Bromwich Albion on 1 February 2003, but made a poor start to his Manchester City career, scoring just two goals in the remainder of the season.

Fowler continued to struggle with fitness problems in the 2003–04 season, completing the full 90 minutes only nine times, however, he did score against his old club, Liverpool, in a 2–2 draw at home. The arrival of close friend Steve McManaman from Real Madrid gave Fowler hope, but the pair failed to rekindle their prolific partnership from their time at Liverpool, and received criticism from the fans and tabloids for their salaries and alleged excesses; they were named and shamed in a sex scandal covered by the &quot;News of the World&quot; that year.

Despite the slump, Fowler rallied for the following campaign, and showed a marked improvement in the second half of the 2004–05 season, scoring his 150th Premiership goal in the 3–2 win over Norwich City on 28 February 2005. However, his failure to convert a 90th-minute penalty kick against Middlesbrough&#x27;s Mark Schwarzer in the final game of the season prevented Manchester City from gaining a place in the UEFA Cup. Despite this, Fowler ended the season as the club&#x27;s joint top goal scorer and gained the approval of the fans, finishing in the top three in the fans&#x27; Player of the Year poll. Fowler later described this as &quot;one of the proudest achievements of my career&quot;.

Fowler had injury problems at the start of the 2005–06 season and rarely featured when fit, making just two substitute appearances in the first four months of the season. His first start of the season came against Scunthorpe United in the FA Cup on 7 January 2006, in which he scored a hat-trick. The following week he scored Manchester City&#x27;s third goal in their 3–1 win against local rivals Manchester United after coming on as a substitute. However, Fowler made only one more appearance for Manchester City before returning to Liverpool on a free transfer.

=== Return to Liverpool ===

On 27 January 2006, Fowler rejoined Liverpool from Manchester City on a free transfer, signing a contract until the end of the season. Fowler had remained a Liverpool fan after he left the club; he was in the Istanbul crowd when Liverpool won the Champions League in 2005.

Liverpool fans were delighted to learn that Fowler had returned; there were large banners in the game against Birmingham City which read &quot;God – number eleven, welcome back to heaven&quot;, with &quot;God&quot; being Fowler&#x27;s nickname while he was previously at Liverpool.

Fowler&#x27;s return against Birmingham City in February 2006 was labelled by the tabloid press as the stuff of fairytales, and he said he felt like &quot;a kid waking up on Christmas morning every day&quot;. Fowler&#x27;s first appearance back at Anfield was as a substitute against Birmingham, receiving a standing ovation upon his introduction. After his return, he had three goals ruled out for offside, before finally getting off the mark on 15 March 2006 in a home game against Fulham, the same opponents against which he scored his first-ever goal for Liverpool 13 years earlier.

Fowler&#x27;s next Liverpool goal, against West Bromwich Albion, meant he overtook Kenny Dalglish in the club&#x27;s all-time top scorers. His resurgence continued as he marked his 31st birthday with a goal against Bolton Wanderers. He made it four goals in five games when he scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Blackburn Rovers on 16 April 2006. However, Fowler&#x27;s fitness remained a concern. In March 2006, manager Rafael Benítez commented on Fowler&#x27;s work and progress by saying, &quot;to buy a Robbie Fowler who is fit and scoring goals would cost a lot, maybe £10m or more&quot;. Despite concerns about his fitness, Fowler finished the 2005–06 season scoring on a more consistent basis than Liverpool&#x27;s other strikers. In May 2006 he was offered a new one-year contract with the club, and celebrated by scoring the first goal in Liverpool&#x27;s last league game of the season in a 3–1 away win at Portsmouth. It was his final game of the season as he was unable to take part in the club&#x27;s FA Cup Final success due to being cup-tied.

Fowler featured rarely in his final Liverpool season, making only six league starts. Bizarrely, all three of his League goals were penalties against Sheffield United. One of these was in the away game on the opening day of the season, and the other two in the reverse fixture at Anfield. Appearances in other competitions were more common due to Rafael Benítez&#x27;s squad rotation policy. On 25 October 2006 Fowler was named as Liverpool&#x27;s captain for the first time since his return in a League Cup tie against Reading, scoring just before half-time in a 4–3 win.

On 5 December, Fowler scored his first two goals in the UEFA Champions League competition proper against Galatasaray (he had previously scored during a qualifying tie some six years prior against FC Haka), though Liverpool lost 3–2.

On 1 May 2007, he was a substitute in the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, brought on in the last few minutes of extra-time. He set up an attack for Dirk Kuyt but the shot went straight at the Chelsea goalkeeper. The match went into a penalty shoot-out that Liverpool won. Fowler was due to take the fifth and final spot-kick, but the game had already ended when Kuyt slotted home his winning penalty.

In what transpired to be his last appearance for the club, against Charlton Athletic on 13 May, Fowler was given the captain&#x27;s armband one final time. He was substituted two minutes from the final whistle and given a standing ovation. He finished his second run as a Liverpool player with a UEFA Champions League runners-up medal, although he was not named in either the starting eleven or the seven substitutes. He became a free agent on 1 July having scored 183 goals in 369 appearances during his two spells at the club.

=== Cardiff City ===
On 21 July 2007 Fowler signed a two-year contract to play for Cardiff City. He missed the season&#x27;s opening fixtures due to a lack of fitness, making his debut in a League Cup tie on 28 August. He scored his first two Cardiff goals on 22 September against Preston North End, scoring with two headers. Fowler scored twice in his next game, a third round League Cup tie against West Brom, which Cardiff won 4–2. This led to a fourth round tie against Fowler&#x27;s former club Liverpool, at Anfield, to which even the Liverpool faithful crowd urged Fowler to score seeing that it may be the last time he would play in Anfield but Cardiff were knocked out in a 2–1 defeat.

In November, Fowler travelled to Frankfurt, Germany to see Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt, a specialist sports injuries doctor, to try and resolve a recurring hip problem that had left him lacking fitness in early season fixtures for the Bluebirds. The treatment involved taking around twenty-eight injections into his hip. He returned to full training in late November and made his comeback on 15 December as a late substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Bristol City. However he went on to suffer another injury blow just days later after a mistimed tackle in training from club captain Darren Purse left him with damaged ankle ligaments. Due to the new injury blow Cardiff and Fowler made plans for him to go to Colorado, United States to undergo keyhole surgery on the hip problem, which had plagued him in recent seasons, in the hope that it would finally resolve the problem.

On 17 January 2008, it was announced that Fowler could miss the rest of the 2007–08 season for Cardiff after his hip operation revealed that the injury was worse than previously thought. Surgeons were forced to perform a micro-fracture for the hip to heal properly. Despite this, he attempted to make a comeback at the end of the season to play in the FA Cup final against Portsmouth and was included in the 18-man match squad. He did not feature in the game in and thus did not receive a runners-up medal having not made an appearance in the competition.

=== Blackburn Rovers ===
Fowler was offered a new pay-as-you-play contract with Cardiff for the 2008–09 season in May 2008 and was expected to sign the contract. However, he pulled out of the deal, preferring to accept an offer of a trial at Blackburn Rovers from former Liverpool colleague Paul Ince. The move left Cardiff manager Dave Jones and chairman Peter Ridsdale furious after the club had assisted Fowler&#x27;s rehabilitation throughout the summer. After training with Blackburn and appearing in a handful of friendlies he was offered a six-month deal by the club to last until January, 
Fowler concluded the trial period at Blackburn by agreeing to a three-month pay-as-you-play deal. He stated that he was eager to return to the Premier League and that his pre-existing relationship with Ince would not earn him any preferential treatment. He made his first appearance against Everton in a 1–0 win in the League Cup on 24 September. With a month left on his contract at Blackburn, Fowler received interest from League Two side Grimsby Town. Fowler, a friend of then Grimsby manager Mike Newell had held talks at Blundell Park over a possible Player/Coach role with the club.

His three-month deal at Blackburn expired on 12 December 2008, and after not being offered a new contract was released by the club, he entered talks with new Australian A-League club North Queensland Fury.

=== North Queensland Fury ===

Fowler signed with the North Queensland Fury on 4 February 2009 and became their inaugural marquee player; with his family relocating to Townsville for the 2009–10 season of the Australian A-League. It was an important signing for the new franchise who struggled to sign a marquee player, while some questioned whether Fowler would be able to cope with the heat and humidity of North Queensland.

Fowler made his debut in July 2009 in a 2–1 pre-season loss against Wolverhampton Wanderers in Perth after recovering from groin and hip complaints. Fowler was subsequently named North Queensland Fury&#x27;s captain for the 2009–10 season and the first in the club&#x27;s history. He scored his first A-League goal from a penalty kick in his club&#x27;s first competitive match against Sydney FC on Saturday 8 August 2009. In rounds four, five, and six Fowler scored &quot;Solo&#x27;s Hyundai A-League Goal of the Week&quot;.

Shortly after his arrival in Australia, it was reported in the British media that Fowler would be making a swift return to his homeland and sign for League One side Tranmere Rovers, who had just appointed Fowler&#x27;s former Liverpool teammate John Barnes as manager. However, Fowler was quick to dismiss talk of a quick return to England. When Barnes was dismissed three months later, it was reported that Tranmere had approached Fowler about becoming player-manager, but these reports too were dismissed.

Fowler ended the season collecting a hat-trick of awards at the club&#x27;s end-of-season awards night, he was awarded the club&#x27;s Player of the Year, Players&#x27; Player of the Year and the Golden Boot as top goal scorer. On 15 June 2010, Fowler confirmed that he was taking legal action over the ending of his playing contract with North Queensland Fury. He was suing the Fury and Football Federation Australia, which took over the running of the club.

=== Perth Glory ===
On 27 April 2010, it was announced that Fowler had agreed to become part of Glory&#x27;s squad for the 2010–11 A-League season. Fowler reportedly ignored offers from Middle East clubs as well as Sydney FC to play in Perth. He joined the Glory for pre-season training in mid-June, following World Cup sponsorship commitments. Fowler scored his first goal for Perth on 29 August, a penalty against Melbourne Heart. He followed this up with a headed goal the following week against the Wellington Phoenix. In the following match, Fowler&#x27;s hat-trick gave the Glory a 3–1 victory against Melbourne Victory at the Dairy Farmers Stadium in Townsville. Fowler ended the year as top scorer for the club.

=== Later career ===

On returning to England, Fowler briefly worked with League One side Milton Keynes Dons on an ad hoc basis to assist the club&#x27;s coaching staff. On 7 April 2011, Bury confirmed that Fowler would join their coaching staff for a week to assist Richie Barker. Fowler then briefly coached Liverpool&#x27;s strikers in April 2011.

On 7 July 2011, Fowler agreed to play with Muangthong United, signing a one-year contract. In a press conference he stated that the weather conditions of Nonthaburi should not be a problem as he had played in Townsville and Perth. He was quickly a hit with Muangthong fans and the Thai public in general; he attended Thailand&#x27;s World Cup Qualifier against Oman wearing the national team&#x27;s shirt. He has since played a handful of scoreless games, both at the Yamaha Stadium and on the road in the AFC Cup, until the Twin Qilins were eliminated from the competition by Al-Kuwait. After the sacking of Henrique Calisto as head coach, Fowler was made player/coach.

After 250 minutes of play, Fowler scored his first goal for MTU against Chiangrai on 16 October 2011. He scored his 250th club career goal on 21 December 2011 against TTM Phichit. in January 2012, Fowler announced he had left the club, who then appointed Slavisa Jokanovic as coach.

On 1 March 2012, Blackpool manager Ian Holloway confirmed that Fowler was training with &quot;the Seasiders&quot; and that he could earn a deal until the end of the season. However, they could not agree a deal and Fowler decided against signing when Karl Oyston offered the striker £100 a week.

Fowler was on a six-man shortlist and interviewed for the vacant manager&#x27;s job at Conference side Macclesfield Town in May 2013, but caretaker manager John Askey was eventually appointed on a full-time basis.

Fowler featured in Steven Gerrard&#x27;s testimonial match against Olympiacos F.C. on 3 August 2013. He came off the bench in the 73rd minute to a warm reception from Liverpool fans. On 21 April 2014, Fowler also featured in a charity match to commemorate the lives of the 96 Liverpool fans who died in the Hillsborough Disaster. Fowler scored both goals for his team in a 2–2 draw. and so officially announced his retirement. In May 2016, it was revealed that Fowler would return to the pitch to play for England in Soccer Aid, a charity football match in aid of UNICEF, alongside Jamie Carragher.

== International career ==
Fowler earned his first cap for England on 27 March 1996, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute in the 1–0 friendly win against Bulgaria at Wembley Stadium. On 24 April, he won his second cap and made his first start for England in the 0–0 draw with Croatia. Despite only having 3 caps to his name, England manager Terry Venables selected Fowler in his 22-man squad for Euro 1996. Fowler went on to make two substitute appearances in the tournament, featuring in the 4–1 win against the Netherlands in the final group game, and in the 0–0 draw against Spain in the quarter-finals, a game England won on penalties.

Fowler did not feature during England&#x27;s qualifying campaign for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, mainly due to a serious knee ligament injury late in the 1997–98 season, and thus missed out on Glenn Hoddle&#x27;s 22-man squad for the tournament. He did, however, manage to score his first goal for his country on 29 March 1997, netting the second goal in a 2–0 friendly win against Mexico at Wembley Stadium. A second goal followed in his next cap on 15 November, netting just before half-time in the 2–0 friendly win against Cameroon.

On 9 June 1999, Fowler played in his first competitive game for England in nearly three years, starting in the 1–1 draw with Bulgaria during Euro 2000 qualifying. Kevin Keegan named Fowler in the preliminary squad for Euro 2000, and after featuring in the three warm-up games against Brazil, Ukraine, and Malta, he was named in the final squad on 1 June 2000. Fowler did not play in the tournament as England were eliminated in the group stages.

Fowler scored his fourth goal for England on 25 May 2001, netting the second goal in the 4–0 friendly win against Mexico at Pride Park, Derby. On 5 September, he scored his first competitive goal for England in the 2–0 win against Albania at St James&#x27; Park, Newcastle. This was during qualifying for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. England qualified for the World Cup, and after scoring in friendlies against Italy and Cameroon, Fowler was selected in Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s 23-man squad for the tournament in South Korea and Japan. He didn&#x27;t appear in any of England&#x27;s group matches, but on 15 June 2002, he came on as a second-half substitute in the 3–0 win against Denmark in the Round of 16. This turned out to be Fowler&#x27;s last cap for his country. He won a total of 26 caps for England and scored 7 goals.

== Managerial career ==

===Muangthong United===
On 1 October 2011, Fowler was appointed as the manager of Muangthong United, where he was already an existing player. Muangthong had taken action and sacked Henrique Calisto; a statement made by the club read, &quot;The board have appointed Robbie Fowler as the acting head coach and have terminated the contract of Portuguese boss Henrique Calisto. The contract is until the end of the season and the team must adapt to long-term goals if it is to succeed in Asia&quot;, thus making Fowler player-manager.

In October 2013, it was announced that Fowler would be taking up a coaching role with Liverpool&#x27;s academy.

===Brisbane Roar===
On 23 April 2019, it was announced by Australian A-League club Brisbane Roar that Fowler had signed a two-year contract to act as the club&#x27;s new head coach ahead of the 2019–20 season. Tony Grant and Darren Davies joined his coaching staff, with Davies having acted as caretaker manager prior to Fowler&#x27;s arrival. Brisbane announced a major clear-out during the off-season, where fourteen senior players were released, notably marquee player Éric Bauthéac. Fowler then made his first signing as a manager in June, when Roy O&#x27;Donovan signed from Newcastle United Jets.

Fowler&#x27;s first competitive match was a 2–0 win over reigning champions Sydney FC on 7 August in the FFA Cup. Fowler won the league&#x27;s Coach of the Month accolade for January and February 2020. With the league suspended in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he resigned on 29 June in order to be closer to his family.

===East Bengal===
On 9 October 2020, Indian Super League side East Bengal announced the signing of Fowler as their new manager. His side finished 9th in 2020–21, winning 3 of 20 games, and his two-year contract was ended by mutual consent on 8 September 2021.

In August 2022, Fowler was coaching at Oxford United &quot;on a casual basis&quot;, according to manager Karl Robinson.

===Al-Qadsiah===
On 29 June 2023, Fowler was appointed as the manager of Saudi First Division League side Al-Qadsiah. He left on 26 October, with six wins and no defeats from eight games.

== Style of play ==
A prolific goal-scorer, Fowler was a quick and opportunistic striker, with good technical ability. Although naturally left-footed, he possessed an accurate, powerful shot from both inside and outside the area with both feet; he was also effective in the air. Despite his reputation as a &quot;goal-poacher&quot;, he was also a creative forward, capable of linking up well with other players, and laying off the ball to other strikers. Despite his talent, he was also known to be injury-prone throughout his career.

== Sponsorship ==
In his playing career, Fowler was sponsored by the sportswear company Nike, and appeared in Nike commercials. In 1997 he starred in Nike&#x27;s &quot;Park Life&quot; commercial (set to the tune &quot;Parklife&quot; by Blur) where a group of amateur pub league players playing football at Hackney Marshes in east London are suddenly joined by top Premier League footballers, including Fowler, Eric Cantona and Ian Wright. In 2000, &quot;Park Life&quot; ranked number 15 in Channel 4&#x27;s poll of the 100 Greatest TV Ads.

== Personal life ==
Fowler married wife Kerrie on 10 June 2001 in the town of Duns, Scottish Borders in Scotland. Together they have three daughters and one son. Their son, Jacob, signed a scholarship with Oxford United in August 2022. Fowler is a cousin of boxer and 2014 Commonwealth Games gold medallist Anthony Fowler. Two of Fowler&#x27;s cousins died of drug abuse.

Fowler was referred to by &quot;The Observer&quot; in September 2005 as Britain&#x27;s richest sportsman, with a £28 million fortune and nearly 100 properties. In 2020, he was an ambassador to a property scheme in Liverpool which led to tens of investors losing several hundreds of pounds.

In association with long-term friend Steve McManaman, Fowler has invested in several racehorses through their company The Macca and Growler Partnership, most notably 2003 Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Celebration Chase runner-up Seebald.

On 2 September 2005, Fowler released a book called &quot;Fowler: My Autobiography&quot;, about his time as a footballer and the issues surrounding him. He released a second book in November 2019 called &quot;Robbie Fowler: My Life In Football : Goals, Glory &amp; The Lessons I&#x27;ve Learnt&quot;.

In June 2008, Fowler participated alongside McManaman in Steve Nash and Claudio Reyna&#x27;s Showdown in Chinatown, an 8-on-8 charity football game at Sara D. Roosevelt Park in Manhattan with McManaman making five of the goals, including one for Fowler.

In 2019, Fowler featured in the first season of ITV show &quot;Harry&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, which featured former football manager Harry Redknapp attempting get a squad of former England international footballers back fit and healthy for a game against Germany legends.

In 2021, Fowler competed in the Legends Tour Celebrity Series of golf tournaments for charity. He won the Celebrity Series event at Formby near his native Liverpool in 2021 and competed at the Celebrity Series Grand Final in Mauritius in 2022, finishing second and winning a total of £17,250 for charity over the 2021 season. He has previously held charity golf days to raise money for charities including The Ichthyosis Support Group. Fowler&#x27;s godson suffers from the rare genetic skin condition ichthyosis, for which there is no cure.

<text>A city gate is a gate which is, or was, set within a city wall. It is a type of fortified gateway.

==Uses==

City gates were traditionally built to provide a point of controlled access to and departure from a walled city for people, vehicles, goods and animals. Depending on their historical context they filled functions relating to defense, security, health, trade, taxation, and representation, and were correspondingly staffed by military or municipal authorities. The city gate was also commonly used to display diverse kinds of public information such as announcements, tax and toll schedules, standards of local measures, and legal texts. It could be heavily fortified, ornamented with heraldic shields, sculpture or inscriptions, or used as a location for warning or intimidation, for example by displaying the heads of beheaded criminals or public enemies.

Notably in Denmark, many market towns used to have at least one city gate mostly as part of the city&#x27;s fortifications, but during the Age of Absolutism their functions become closely linked to the collection of customs, the so-called octroi, which from 1660 onwards was charged to the market town&#x27;s coffers. When absolutism in Denmark came to an end after the revolutions of 1848, gate consumption was abolished in 1852, and since then the city gates also began to disappear.

Medieval Danish city gates are found today only in Vesterport, Faaborg, and Mølleporten, Stege, as well as in Flensburg, today in Germany. Further city gates, in one form or another, can be found across the world in cities dating back to ancient times to around the 19th century. Many cities would close their gates after a certain curfew each night, for example, a bigger one like Prague or a smaller one like the one in Flensburg, in the north of Germany.

With increased stability and freedom, many walled cities removed such fortifications as city gates, although many still survive; albeit for historic interest rather than security. Many surviving gates have been heavily restored, rebuilt or new ones created to add to the appearance of a city, such as Bab Bou Jalous in Fes. With increased levels of traffic, city gates have come under threat in the past for impeding the flow of traffic, such as Temple Bar Gate in London which was removed in the 19th century.

<doc id="346084" wikidata="Q16849687" url="?curid=346084" title="Bush-warbler">
<text>Bush-warblers (or bush warblers) are small insectivorous songbirds of the genera &quot;Cettia&quot;, &quot;Horornis&quot;, and &quot;Bradypterus&quot;. They were formerly placed in the &quot;wastebin&quot; Old World warbler family. None of the genera as traditionally delimited are believed to be monophyletic.

Due to their external similarity convergently acquired by strong selective pressures due to the identical habitat, they were occasionally believed to be close relatives. However, they belong to two well-distant families in the Sylvioidea, the &quot;warbler-and-babbler&quot; superfamily:

<text>Virgin Australia is an Australian airline based in Brisbane. It is one of two active airlines (the other being Virgin Atlantic) to use the Virgin brand, as well as the larger by fleet size. It commenced services on 31 August 2000 as Virgin Blue, with two aircraft on a single route. It suddenly found itself becoming a major airline in Australia&#x27;s domestic market after the collapse of Ansett Australia in September 2001. It has since grown to be Australia’s largest domestic airline by passenger market share, as of December 2024. The airline&#x27;s business model consists of the core features of a low-cost carrier, along with some elements of a full-service airline. As of June 2024, the airline serves 33 Australian destinations with its Boeing 737 MAX and Boeing 737 Next Generation fleets from its hubs in Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney.

The airline also operates a limited number of short-haul international flights. Australian law prohibits majority-foreign-owned local airlines, like Virgin Australia, from operating international flights to and from Australia. However, Virgin Australia evades this law by operating international flights through a controversial &#x27;shell corporation&#x27; structure, a practice that is not illegal but has been widely criticised across Australia&#x27;s aviation industry.

The airline&#x27;s headquarters are based in South Bank, Queensland. It was co-founded by British businessman Richard Branson (the founder of Virgin Group), and former CEO Brett Godfrey.

In 2011, the airline went through a period of transformation, changing its brand to Virgin Australia. This included the introduction of a new aircraft livery, new uniforms, and new onboard menu options, as well as a business class product, which Virgin Blue did not have. New wide-body aircraft were acquired to compete with Qantas, and business class was rolled out across the Virgin Australia network.

On 21 April 2020, Virgin Australia Holdings went into voluntary administration, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and financial troubles in the years leading up to the pandemic. On 26 June 2020, it was announced that Bain Capital had entered into a sale and implementation deed with administrator Deloitte to acquire Virgin Australia. Creditors agreed to this proposal on 4 September 2020, with the reorganisation and change of ownership completed on 17 November. The airline announced that as part of its relaunch, it would focus on being a mid-market &quot;hybrid&quot; carrier.

On 1 October 2024, Qatar Airways announced intentions to purchase a 25% stake in Virgin Australia.

==History==

===Early years as Virgin Blue (2000–2006)===
Virgin Australia was launched as Virgin Blue, a low-cost airline, in August 2000, with two Boeing 737-400 aircraft, one of which was leased from then-sister airline Virgin Express. Initially offering seven return flights a day between Brisbane and Sydney, this was expanded to cover all major Australian cities and many holiday destinations. The Virgin Blue name was the result of an open competition; it was a play on the predominantly red livery and the Australian slang tradition of calling a red-headed male &#x27;Blue&#x27; or &#x27;Bluey&#x27;. This term has been used by the older generation, also known as the boomer generation.

The timing of Virgin Blue&#x27;s entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of Ansett Australia in September 2001. Ansett&#x27;s failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia&#x27;s second domestic carrier rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space, without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at Sydney Airport however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there—a collection of prefabricated buildings without aerobridges—longer than was needed. The airline&#x27;s corporate and operations functions were located in its headquarters building at 112 Barry Parade in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane.

As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase out its older 737-400s in favor of 737-700 and −800 series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets, and greater fuel efficiency.

Virgin Group&#x27;s holding in Virgin Australia was later reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate Patrick Corporation, and later by a public float. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.

In May 2006, Toll Holdings acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008, Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013, Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.

Virgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as Southwest Airlines and Ryanair of eliminating costs such as included in-flight meals and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems. It also cut costs in the past by limiting the number of airports serviced and by operating one type of aircraft, the Boeing 737. This strategy changed with the introduction of a second type into the fleet. The airline ordered 20 Embraer E-jets, in a mix of six E170s and 14 E190s. These were ordered specifically so that the airline could re-enter the Sydney–Canberra market that it abandoned in 2004, and to fly to less populous areas. The first E-170 arrived in Australia in September 2007, and by the end of the year, the three on initial order had been delivered. These were placed on limited-frequency services before full-scale operations were launched on 4 February 2008 with services from Sydney to Canberra (branded as &#x27;Capital Jet&#x27; services), Mackay in Queensland, and the New South Wales regional centres of Port Macquarie and Albury, which were promoted with a one-cent fare. The flights to Canberra and the regional centres signified an effort to compete more directly with Qantas and its subsidiary QantasLink operation, which flies to all three cities, and with independent Regional Express Airlines.

===Codesharing and network consolidation (2006–2010)===

At its inception in 2000, Virgin Blue did not have interline or marketing alliances with other airlines. However, after the collapse of its domestic competitor Ansett Australia, it began a codeshare agreement with United Airlines. This allowed United customers to fly from the United States to any of Virgin Blue&#x27;s Australian destinations that United did not already serve. In 2006, in an effort to compete with Qantas, Virgin Blue started exploring these relationships, forming frequent flyer agreements with Emirates, Hawaiian Airlines and Malaysia Airlines. Virgin Blue also had an Interline Agreement with Regional Express Airlines for travellers to and from smaller regional centres in the eastern states of Australia, and operated its own two routes with Virgin Australia Regional Airlines in Western Australia. In November 2007, the airline announced an agreement with Garuda Indonesia, offering easy transfer from a domestic Virgin Blue flight to an international Garuda Indonesia service departing from Perth, Melbourne, Sydney or Darwin. Virgin Blue subsequently announced an agreement with Vietnam Airlines, which allowed passengers to fly from Melbourne and Sydney and connect with Vietnam Airlines&#x27; destinations through its flight network.


In 2008, Business class was introduced throughout its entire fleet. New seating was installed in the first three rows of the cabin. These could be converted from three seats in economy configuration to two seats for premium economy. The premium product offered priority check-in, larger baggage allowance, lounge access, priority boarding, increased legroom and all-inclusive in flight entertainment, meals and beverages on board. The product was aimed at business and corporate customers. The airline began charging economy-class passengers for checked baggage in September 2008. The airline further announced its intention to operate Airbus A330 aircraft between Perth and the East Coast, starting in May 2011.

In December 2010, Virgin Blue entered into alliances with Etihad Airways and Air New Zealand for code-sharing, reciprocal lounge and frequent flyer access and other co-operational projects. Virgin Blue also entered into talks with Delta Air Lines about the possibility of joining SkyTeam, one of the top three alliances in the world, as V Australia and Delta sought approval for an agreement between the two airlines to co-operate on trans-Pacific services. The agreement was rejected by the United States Department of Transportation under United States antitrust law. Upon review the agreement was approved by the United States Department of Transportation on 10 June 2011.

On 20 January 2011, Air New Zealand announced it would take a shareholding stake of between 10% and 14.99% in Virgin Blue. Air New Zealand chief executive Rob Fyfe described the investment &quot;as part of Air New Zealand&#x27;s strategy to develop scale and reach in this region&quot; but said the airline had no intention of making a full takeover.

===Launch of V Australia (2008–2011)===
In early 2006, Virgin Blue announced its intention to operate up to seven flights a week to the U.S. through either Los Angeles or San Francisco. At the time, only Qantas and United Airlines competed in the Australia-US transpacific market. The airline was given permission for ten flights a week to the U.S. by Australian regulators on 24 July 2007. The plans were approved by US regulators on 15 February 2008, due to the signing of an open skies agreement between Australia and the US. Instead of using its existing brand, Virgin Blue launched a fully owned subsidiary with a separate Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate, named V Australia as the result of a public naming competition, with a fleet of five specifically branded 777-300ERs.

The airline launched flights between Sydney and Los Angeles in 2009, followed by flights from Melbourne and Brisbane after obtaining permission to operate an unlimited number of flights between Australia and the U.S. by the Australian International Air Services Commission. V Australia also applied to the United States Department of Transportation to operate services to San Francisco, Seattle, Las Vegas, and New York, but these plans never materialised. V Australia later launched flights to Nadi International Airport, Phuket and Johannesburg (all of which were discontinued prior to the brand being absorbed into Virgin Australia, although Virgin Australia continued to operate to Phuket until 2015, and to Nadi), and Abu Dhabi to consolidate Virgin Blue&#x27;s codeshare agreement with Etihad Airways.

===Reorganisation and rebranding (2011–2019)===
On 7 May 2010, Brett Godfrey officially stepped down as Virgin Blue CEO after steering the company through its first 10 years. John Borghetti, former Qantas executive general manager, took over as the new Chief Executive. Following Borghetti&#x27;s arrival as CEO, a number of key Qantas staff moved to Virgin Blue while key Virgin Blue staff departed the airline, causing much speculation regarding a forthcoming rebrand or reorganisation of the airline. In February 2011, the re-brand was confirmed when the airline announced that the word &#x27;Blue&#x27; would be dropped from its name as part of a campaign to attract more business travellers away from rival Qantas. This came shortly after the unveiling of new crew uniforms and business-class seats. The airline stated that the re-brand would proceed in stages and would reportedly include a new fleet livery and the renaming of the other Virgin Blue Group airlines as well.

On 4 May 2011, the former Virgin Blue revealed its new name, Virgin Australia, as well as its new livery. In addition to the new name, branding and livery, the airline also showed off its new flagship the Airbus A330 with new domestic business class. Boeing 737 business class seating was also revealed, to be introduced on all of Virgin&#x27;s jet aircraft by the end of 2011. Pacific Blue and V Australia were both folded into the new Virgin Australia brand, following an agreement with former Virgin Atlantic shareholder Singapore Airlines, which ever since the establishment of Virgin Blue in 2000 had previously prohibited use of the &quot;Virgin&quot; brand outside Australia.

Early in 2011 it was announced that Virgin Blue had signed a ten-year deal with Perth-based regional airline Skywest Airlines, for Skywest to operate up to 18 ATR-72 turboprop aircraft leased by Virgin, in order to better compete in east coast regional markets served by QantasLink and Regional Express Airlines. The turboprops would supplement the existing Embraer E-190s and replace the E-170s, which would be phased out due to their being uneconomical on the routes operated by Virgin.

In October 2011, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) approved a proposed code-share alliance between Singapore Airlines and Virgin Australia, subject to other regulatory approvals in both countries.

On 31 May 2016, Chinese aviation holding company HNA Group agreed to purchase 13% of Virgin Australia Holdings for A$159 million, subject to authorisation from the ACCC, a stake which HNA Group ultimately intended to increase to 19.99%. The deal also created a codeshare partnership between Virgin Australia and Chinese airlines in which HNA Group held shares, on routes between Australia and China. Virgin intended to launch flights between Australian destinations and Beijing and Hong Kong by 2017 to consolidate the agreement.

By October 2016, Air New Zealand sold its remaining 2.5 percent stake for A$65.7 million to investors including the Nanshan Group. On 4 April 2018, Air New Zealand announced the end of the code- and revenue-sharing partnership with Virgin Australia, effective 28 October 2018.

On 12 June 2018, Virgin Australia CEO John Borghetti confirmed that he would leave the airline before the end of his contract in January 2020. Borghetti, who became CEO in May 2010, mentioned that his initial plans were to stay in the position for three to four years, however, the company&#x27;s growth and success prompted him to stay on. In February 2019 Paul Scurrah was announced as Borghetti&#x27;s successor, with Scurrah commencing as CEO on 25 March 2019.

On 2 July 2018, Virgin Australia launched a Sydney to Hong Kong service. It ceased on 2 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===COVID-19 impact and administration (2020)===

On 18 March 2020, Virgin Australia CEO Paul Scurrah announced the grounding of the equivalent of 53 planes due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, effective 30 March. This had the effect of temporarily returning Virgin Australia to being a domestic-only airline.

On 31 March 2020, Virgin Australia confirmed it had asked the Federal Government for a $1.4 billion loan to help it through the COVID-19 crisis. The airline said its bailout proposal was &quot;subject to approval by the Virgin Australia Holdings board and the Australian Government&quot; and &quot;may or may not include conversion to equity in certain circumstances.&quot; Qantas responded by noting its revenue was three times higher than Virgin&#x27;s, meaning that if Virgin was bailed-out, they should be given a $4.2 billion loan as to not distort the market.

On 4 April 2020, the Australian Government announced it would be subsidising a bare-bones international network operated by Qantas and Virgin Australia for four weeks in April. Virgin&#x27;s began operating later that month to Hong Kong twice weekly and once weekly to Los Angeles. On the same day, it became known that Virgin Australia had decided to shut down its New Zealand operation permanently, resulting in 600 jobs in New Zealand to be lost.

On 9 April 2020, it was announced that all services, except one Melbourne-Sydney return flight six times a week, would be suspended from 10 April.

On 14 April 2020 Virgin Australia Holdings was granted a trading halt on the Australian Securities Exchange pending a company announcement or to start trading again on 16 April 2020.

On 16 April 2020, the Federal Government announced it would spend $160 million subsidising a minimum number of services operated by Virgin Australia and Qantas. The domestic minimal network announced is effective 17 April until 8 June 2020 and involves 64 flights weekly. It serves Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, regional WA and regional Queensland.

On 18 April 2020, the Queensland Government offered $200 million to help bail out Virgin Australia, however, the bailout had a number of conditions including Federal Government backing, debt restructuring, shareholders and bondholders contributing, headquarters remaining in Brisbane and ongoing regional flights.

On 21 April 2020, Virgin Australia confirmed it had gone into voluntary administration, citing its inability to continue operations without a Federal Government bailout. However, there are no changes being made to which flights are being operated.

Virgin Australia Holdings, Ltd. and 39 affiliated debtors filed Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The primary case is #20-11024.

===Restructuring and post-pandemic period (2020–present) ===
In June 2020, the airline was included in the purchase of Virgin Australia Holdings by Bain Capital.

In August 2020, Bain Capital announced the plan for a new &#x27;Virgin Australia 2.0&#x27;, signalling that the move was more focussed towards streamlining and refocussing Virgin Australia, rather than a complete overhaul. The announcement included the immediate retirement of the remaining ATR, Airbus A330 and 777 fleets, in addition to the retirement of the Tigerair brand.

On 15 October 2020, as a result of numerous restructuring measures by Bain Capital, Virgin Australia CEO Paul Scurrah announced that he would resign. Jayne Hrdlicka was announced as Scurrah&#x27;s successor, with Hrdlicka commencing as CEO on 18 November 2020.

On 15 December 2021, Virgin Australia and United Airlines announced a new partnership beginning in April 2022. This brought an end to the Delta Air Lines partnership after over a decade.

In September 2023, it was reported that Virgin Australia had been affected by the false-certification scandal plaguing London-based AOG Technics, with two Boeing 737-800s temporarily put out of service after the airline became aware that the engines had been fitted with unauthorised parts. VH-VUT was fitted with an unauthorised low pressure turbine blade, whilst VH-YFR was fitted with an unauthorised seal for an inner high-pressure turbine nozzle.

On 10 October 2023, Virgin Australia announced it had returned to profitability for the first time in 11 years, reporting a profit of $129 million. Revenue more than doubled compared to the prior year to $5 billion as the company responded strongly to increased customer demand following COVID-19.

On 1 May 2024, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) voted in favour of supporting a proposed agreement of reintroducing a codeshare agreement between Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia. In June 2024 this was granted formal approval. However, this codeshare is limited in scope to specific trans-Tasman routes into Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

In October 2024, Qatar Airways agreed terms to purchase a 25% stake in Virgin Australia. After receiving clearance by the ACCC and Foreign Investment Review Board, the deal was approved by the Treasurer of Australia in February 2025.

==Corporate affairs==
===Head office===
Until its move to South Bank in September 2020, Virgin Australia&#x27;s head office was the Virgin Village in Bowen Hills, Brisbane. The building, with about A-Grade office space, was triple net leased to Virgin Blue.

As the airline started operations, it decided to place its head office in the Brisbane area (initially as Virgin Blue, at 112 Barry Parade in Fortitude Valley). Brett Godfrey, the airline co-founder and Chief Executive for 10 years, said in 2006 that the decision &quot;was a long considered one and has worked well&quot;. The airline originally had its head office in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane. The airline purchased a $61 million site in Bowen Hills for its new head office. The firm Sunland Group, which had acquired the Bowen Hills site for $8 million in 2005, had scheduled to complete the new head office in March, and the airline would be ready to move into the new head office by August of the following year. The Virgin Village formally opened on 17 October 2008. As of 2008, 1,000 employees worked at Virgin Village.

=== Sister airlines ===

==== Former ====

===== Pacific Blue =====

In September 2003, Pacific Blue was set up to offer a low-cost service between New Zealand and Australia. Pacific Blue aimed to position itself as a low-cost competitor to Air New Zealand and Qantas on trans-Tasman routes. Pacific Blue also operated services on behalf of the Polynesian Blue joint-venture with the government of Samoa. Pacific Blue has since been rebranded under the Virgin Australia name and livery.

===== V Australia =====

In early 2006, Virgin Blue&#x27;s parent company announced its intention to operate up to seven flights a week to the United States using either Los Angeles International Airport or San Francisco International Airport, saying that the route was needed to make the airline as profitable as possible. On 25 July 2007, it was announced that &quot;V Australia&quot; would be the name of the new carrier.

===== Tigerair Australia =====

On 30 October 2012, Virgin Australia Holdings announced it had purchased a 60% stake in Tiger Airways Australia for $35 million. Tiger was planned to be continued to operate as a low cost subsidiary for 20 years. In October 2014 Virgin took full control of Tigerair for one dollar. After Bain Capital acquired Virgin Australia, in 2020, Tiger was suspended and then later officially discontinued by Bain Capital.

==== Current ====
===== Virgin Australia Regional Airlines =====

On 11 April 2013, Virgin Australia Holdings completed its acquisition of regional airline Skywest Airlines. Skywest was then renamed Virgin Australia Regional Airlines.

===Marketing and sponsorship===

Since its inception, Virgin Blue had sponsored many sporting teams in a bid to promote its brand.
In February 2007, Virgin Blue signed a two-year sponsorship deal with NRL team the South Sydney Rabbitohs. The Rabbitohs were the first rugby league team Virgin Australia sponsored. One of the airline&#x27;s Boeing 737-800s had slight changes to its livery to commemorate this sponsorship; the Australian flag held by the &quot;Virgin Girl&quot; was replaced by the Rabbitohs&#x27; flag. Virgin Australia is also the official sponsor of the National Basketball League (NBL), and the title sponsor of NBL team the Brisbane Bullets.

In November 2010, the Australian Football League (AFL) decided not to renew its marketing contract with Qantas, instead choosing Virgin Blue for a deal worth A$5–8 million.

Virgin Blue gained extra revenue (and publicity) by painting two aircraft as &quot;flying billboards&quot;. One promoted a brand of men&#x27;s razor, the other a Queensland Government campaign to attract businesses to the state. Both aircraft have since been withdrawn from the Virgin Blue fleet.

In 2007, Virgin Blue introduced an advertising campaign with the slogan &quot;Get What You Want&quot;, named after the song by Queensland band Operator Please that featured in its TV advertisements. In 2009, Virgin Blue introduced an all new advertising campaign entitled &quot;Now there&#x27;s an idea&quot;. TV Commercials showing comparisons between flying in Australia in 1999 as opposed to 2009 were screened, to the tune a song by The Cat Empire. New billboard advertising was launched, showcasing Virgin Blue&#x27;s variety of products and on-time performance records.

In 2011, with the airline&#x27;s rebranding as Virgin Australia, the airline&#x27;s slogan was changed to &quot;Now you&#x27;re flying&quot;.

Virgin Australia became a sponsor of the newest AFL clubs, the Gold Coast Suns and Greater Western Sydney Giants, in 2011 and 2014 respectively. Virgin Australia also appear as a sponsor on the guernseys of the Carlton Football Club since June 2017 initially due to the loss of a sponsor of the club, but Carlton announced in August 2017 that the partnership will be extended until the end of the 2022 AFL season. In 2016, the airline reached an agreement with V8 Supercars to rename the annual motorsport series to the Virgin Australia Supercars Championship starting 1 July.

===Awards===
The airline has won a number of awards since its inception. It and certain of its employees won five 2009 service excellence awards of the Customer Service Institute of Australia. Since being named as best low-cost airline in the Asia/Pacific region in the Skytrax 2002 Airline of the Year Survey, the airline has been voted best airline in a number of different categories and by a number of different organisations.

As an employer, Virgin Australia was recognised as the most attractive employer in Australia in 2015 at the annual Randstad Award. It also placed in the top 3 for the previous five years, including a top spot in 2011.

The airline&#x27;s frequent flyer program, Velocity Rewards (now Velocity Frequent Flyer), won the 2009 Freddie Awards for best frequent flyer program, best award redemption, best affinity credit card, best member communications and best website. This was the fourth consecutive Freddie Awards that Velocity won.

Velocity Frequent Flyer won the 2018 Freddie Awards for program of the year, best elite program, best customer service, and best redemption ability. This was the sixth consecutive year that Velocity won the best redemption ability award.

==Destinations==
On 11 December 2024, Qatar Airways announced that passengers can begin booking air tickets for direct routes to Doha from Sydney, Brisbane and Perth on behalf of Virgin Australia for travels commencing June 2025 onwards. This collaboration will also see Melbourne to be added in the mix later the same year.

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
, Virgin Australia operates the following aircraft; This list excludes Airbus A320 and Fokker 100 aircraft operated by Virgin Australia Regional Airlines

Initially, Virgin Australia leased its aircraft, but recent additions to the fleet have been purchased outright. Virgin Australia-owned Boeing 737s are indicated by the Boeing customer code FE in the model suffix. The former 777 fleet owned by V Australia are indicated by ZG in the model suffix. In order to conserve capital, Virgin Australia has started accepting second hand aircraft into their fleet, like the Boeing 737-700s from KLM to replace the ageing Fokker 100s.

On 28 June 2023, Virgin Australia took delivery its first 737 MAX 8, becoming the second Australian operator of the type. After limited domestic operations, Virgin Australia deployed the plane onto the Cairns–Tokyo Haneda route in late July 2023.

On 13 September 2024, Virgin Australia announced that 12 orders would be switched from the Boeing 737 MAX 10 to the MAX 8 due to continuing supply chain delays.

===Former fleet===
The airline has removed the following aircraft types from passenger service:

===Fleet development===

In November 2006, Virgin Blue announced plans to purchase 11 Embraer 190 and three Embraer 170 aircraft with options for six more E-jets, which later became orders for an additional three E170s and three E190s. In February 2008 a further four E190s were ordered, leaving six options and ten purchase rights. Virgin Blue received its first Embraer 170 in early September 2007 at a special ceremony at the Embraer plant in Sao Jose dos Campos. A revised logo was introduced on the tail, bringing the Virgin Blue brand into line with the logos of other Virgin-branded companies.

Like Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Australia gives the aircraft in its fleet names, previously incorporating female names and words connected with Australian cities and localities or other quintessentially Australian themes. Recent additions to the fleet have featured names of famous Australian beaches. Names on Virgin Australia aircraft include &#x27;Brissie Lizzie&#x27; (&quot;Brissie&quot; being an Australian slang name for Brisbane, and &quot;Lizzie&quot; being slang for Elizabeth), &#x27;Sassy Sydney&#x27; (Sydney is a female name as well as the name of one of Australia&#x27;s largest cities), &#x27;Prue Blue&#x27; (incorporating the name Prudence and also a pun on the Australian phrase &quot;true blue&quot;, meaning &quot;patriotic&quot;), &#x27;Tassie Tigress&#x27; (incorporating both the slang name for Tasmania and the common name for the thylacine) and &#x27;Mackay-be Diva&#x27; (a pun on the city of Mackay, Queensland and Makybe Diva, a famous Australian racehorse). Beaches which have aircraft named after them include Cable Beach, Cottesloe Beach and Bondi Beach. Each aircraft in the Virgin Australia livery (some were painted in Pacific Blue livery for cross-promotional reasons) also features a &quot;virgin girl&quot; as nose art, complete with a wide-brimmed Aussie hat, trailing an Australian flag.

On 24 October 2007, Virgin Australia announced the introduction of premium economy on all domestic flights.

Virgin Australia began long haul international operations as V Australia, commencing its first passenger flight operations on 27 February 2009. V Australia was folded back into Virgin on 7 December 2011.

On 10 January 2011, Virgin Blue entered a 10-year strategic alliance with Perth-based Skywest Airlines (which would later be purchased and rebranded as Virgin Australia Regional Airlines) to operate up to 18 new Virgin-branded turboprop aircraft from mid-2011. On 23 February, it was announced that the aircraft would be ATR 72s, to enter service beginning in May 2011; they would allow Virgin Australia to both replace its fleet of Embraer 170s and introduce new regional routes. The turboprops would be operated by Skywest Airlines under a wet lease agreement. The May in-service date was not met, and in late July the first announcement was made concerning routes to be served. It was reported that the ATR-72s would be initially employed on services between Brisbane and Gladstone, Queensland; from Brisbane and Sydney to Port Macquarie in New South Wales; and on additional services between Sydney and Canberra.

On 25 January 2012, Virgin Australia announced additional services between Brisbane, Proserpine, Rockhampton and Cairns. It wet leased two Fokker 100s from Alliance Airlines to operate these services. On 26 February 2013, Virgin Australia announced it would start flights between Brisbane and Bundaberg on 4 May 2013.

===Orders===
An agreement was signed with Boeing on 1 April 2010 for an order of fifty firm Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with flexibility to convert to either Boeing 737-700s or Boeing 737-900ERs; as well as 25 additional options and 30 future purchase rights. Deliveries were scheduled to be completed in 2017. In July 2012, Virgin Australia announced an order for 23 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, with deliveries planned to be between 2019 and 2021. Virgin converted its outstanding order for 17 Boeing 737-800 aircraft to the MAX model in 2015, bringing the total order for this type to 40 aircraft. In August 2018, Virgin converted 10 of its 737 MAX 8 orders for the larger MAX 10 variant. Deliveries of the MAX 10 were to begin in 2022. In April 2019, the airline deferred deliveries and converted 15 MAX 8 orders to the larger MAX 10 variant. Deliveries of the MAX 10 were scheduled to start in 2021, while MAX 8&#x27;s are not expected until 2025, however due to worldwide groundings and suspensions of deliveries and production of the 737 MAX aircraft temporarily stopping following two fatal crashes, deliveries are likely to be delayed. In December 2020, Virgin cancelled orders for the MAX 8 and revised its order to just 25 MAX 10s with the planned delivery date deferred to mid-2023.

However, in April 2022 CEO Jayne Hrdlicka announced the company had reversed the cancellation of the MAX 8 order with &#x27;at least&#x27; four (later rising to 8) MAX 8 jets arriving by February 2023. This announcement was made in conjunction with efforts to replace the older Fokker 100 craft in the Virgin Australian Regional Airlines fleet. With the delays in certifying the 737 MAX 10 being experienced by Boeing it is not likely Virgin Australia would see its first MAX 10 until early 2025. Furthermore, due to these delays Virgin Australia was believed to be assessing options to swap the MAX 10 orders for MAX 8 models. At the same time as receiving its third MAX 8 into service Virgin Australia announced an increase in the MAX 8 order from 8 to 14 total air frames.

===Cargo===
Virgin Australia Cargo was launched in July 2015 after the airline&#x27;s contract to carry freight on behalf of Toll expired and was not renewed. The airline signed a five-year carriage contract with TNT in 2016 and operations of dedicated freighter aircraft commenced on 4 July the same year. Between 2016 and 2020 ASL Australia (formally Pionair) operated three BAe 146-200 aircraft and Airwork operated 1 Boeing 737-300F on a wet-lease contract for the company. Since Virgin Australia went into voluntary administration in March 2020, contracts with both companies appear to be discontinued, as the aircraft are now flying for other companies around Australia and New Zealand. The Virgin Australia Cargo brand still exists, however, but with freight placed in the hold of its passenger aircraft.

===Domestic and short-haul international operations===
====Business class====
Virgin Australia offers a business class service on most of its jet aircraft. The seat pitch is on its Boeing 737-800.

==In-flight amenities==

===Food and beverages===
Virgin Australia offers business class passengers a full three-course meal prepared on board by the crew.

The business class food menu is accompanied by a premium range of Australian wines, beers and spirits and non-alcoholic beverages, including barista-style coffee.

In Economy Class, the airline offers a buy on board food and drink service and serves complimentary non-alcoholic beverages to all passengers on all domestic and short haul international Virgin Australia flights. 

===In-flight entertainment===
In December 2006, Virgin Australia (as Virgin Blue) announced a partnership between Australian cable television providers Foxtel and Austar, to introduce a &quot;Live2Air&quot; service on most flights by mid-2007. The Live2Air system was only available on selected Boeing 737 aircraft, and was phased out beginning in 2012.

Virgin Australia&#x27;s Boeing 777-300ERs and Airbus A330-200 aircraft&#x27;s in-flight entertainment &quot;RED&quot; was based on the Panasonic eX2 system. RED was fully touch-screen and handset controlled. There was no fee for use. RED featured an extensive video on demand library that includes new release film, TV series and TV programmes. Destination guides were available. Other functions available through RED included music on demand (approx 200+ CD library) and video games. Seat-to-seat chat was available as well as in flight map and flight information.

In December 2012, Virgin Australia introduced an in-flight Wi-Fi system to provide music, movies and TV shows to tablets, smartphones, laptops and similar devices. The system, which does not offer internet access, is estimated to be fitted on all the airline&#x27;s planes within 2 years.

In 2018, Virgin Australia began upgrading the in-flight Wi-Fi system in order to offer wireless internet access. The Boeing 777 fleet was expected to be rolled out by the end of 2018, while the Boeing 737 and Airbus A330 fleets are expected to complete rollout of internet access by the end of 2019. The regional fleets of Airbus A320s, ATR 72-600s and Fokker 100s will not be rolled out with internet Wi-Fi access.

After the Virgin Australia take-over by Bain Capital, they removed access to their in-flight Wi-Fi system. According to the ABC &quot;Virgin Australia is reviewing its in-flight offerings and services including WiFi and entertainment&quot; under the leadership of newly appointed CEO Jayne Hrdlicka, leaving Qantas to be the only Australian carrier to offer in-flight WiFi.

Virgin Australia has once again begun offering WiFi and stream-to-your-device entertainment on all 737 MAX and equipped 737-800s. Free entertainment options include 400+ hours of movies and TV shows, as well as podcasts and books, along with a basic inflight map once connected to the inflight network. Connections to the internet is charged for all passengers other than Velocity Platinum and Business Class guests, who enjoy complimentary access.

==Lounge service==
To capture a share of the business traveller market, Virgin decided to provide a members&#x27; lounge facility for travellers. Originally this was called &quot;The Blue Room&quot; and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former Ansett terminals across the country, with the defunct &quot;Golden Wing club&quot; lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.

In 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as &quot;The Lounge&quot;, which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included buffet food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and WiFi internet access for travellers.

In May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge, simply referring to it as &quot;Virgin Australia Lounge&quot; – designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and &#x27;moods&#x27;.

Lounges operated:
* Adelaide Domestic Lounge
* &quot;Alice Springs Domestic Lounge&quot; (closed)

===Access===
Complimentary lounge access is available to Velocity Frequent Flyer Gold and Platinum members when flying with Virgin Australia, or when travelling in Business Class.

Membership is also available and can be purchased online by logging into a passenger&#x27;s Velocity Frequent Flyer account. As of July 2021, membership costs AUD399 per year and there is no joining fee. Lifetime memberships and single-use passes are also available for purchase.

==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==

Virgin Australia launched its frequent-flyer program Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner National Australia Bank offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected Westpac, American Express and Diners Club cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.

Status levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level &quot;red&quot; status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain &quot;silver&quot; and &quot;gold&quot; status, each with its own set of benefits.

Initially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned six points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned five points per dollar, Silver members remained at six points, and Gold members earned seven. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity&#x27;s airline partners, has always based on distance.

Velocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer &quot;any seat, any time&quot; reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. Qantas introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.

In August 2011, the program was relaunched as &quot;Velocity Frequent Flyer&quot; and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.

In July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, the first prepaid traveller card in Australia. The key feature of this card is it allows users to load money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling. Users can access ATMs around the world as well as shop anywhere that the Visa card is accepted. Supported currencies include the Australian dollar (AUD), Canadian dollar (CAD), euro (EUR), pound sterling (GBP), Hong Kong dollar (HKD), Japanese yen (JPY), New Zealand dollar (NZD), Singapore dollar (SGD), Thai baht (THB), US dollar (USD) and South African rand (ZAR). Travellers earn one Velocity point per $1 spent overseas and one point per $2 spent in Australia.

In 2015, Velocity Frequent Flyer won the &#x27;Program of the Year&quot; in the Middle East &amp; Asia/Oceania District category at the Freddie Awards.

==Controversies==
* In 2003, a man with a disability and having incomplete quadriplegia was removed from a Virgin Blue flight because staff thought he was drunk or a terrorist. He subsequently settled a lawsuit against the airline.
* In October 2005, the airline lost a discrimination case over the age of flight attendants they employed. Eight former flight attendants aged over 34 previously employed by the collapsed Ansett Australia had applied for employment with Virgin Blue but none had gained work. They claimed they were discriminated against because of their age and won compensation in March 2006. The airline&#x27;s appeal against this decision failed and the company was ordered to pay costs.
* In May 2006, a controversy arose over Virgin Blue&#x27;s policy with regard to passengers with disabilities. Former Chief Executive Brett Godfrey affirmed the policy of the company that passengers who were &quot;unable to look after themselves on board should travel with carers&quot;. After a hearing in the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Virgin Blue backed down from this policy, agreeing to limit it to passengers weighing over 130 kg. However the chair of the ACT Disability Advisory Council, Craig Wallace, who uses a wheelchair, was refused passage on a Virgin Blue flight booked for 8 October 2006. In a media release on 29 September, ACTDAC claimed that &quot;Virgin Blue has also refused to refund $418 in fares from the flight for Mr Wallace or Council staff. Ironically, they have listed these fares as a &#x27;credit&#x27; – a credit Mr Wallace or other people in his situation are prohibited from accessing by Virgin&#x27;s own policy&quot;.
* In January 2007, Virgin Blue attracted controversy when its staff at Adelaide Airport ordered a passenger to remove a T-shirt bearing the slogan &quot;World&#x27;s Number One Terrorist&quot; above an image of George W. Bush. The wearer, Allen Jasson from London, was informed that the garment was potentially offensive. Jasson had also experienced difficulty on earlier flights with Qantas. A spokeswoman for Virgin Blue defended the decision.
* In January 2011, the airline was fined $110,000 after breaking anti-spamming regulations. Consumers complained they were unable to unsubscribe from the airline&#x27;s mailing list. The Australian Communications and Media Authority said the airline would &quot;Engage an independent third party to thoroughly assess its email marketing processes and to implement any recommended changes.&quot;
* Virgin Australia&#x27;s policy of not allowing male passengers to sit next to children travelling alone for fear of child molestation has been criticised by persons concerned as act of discrimination against men (Airline sex discrimination policy controversy). Following a public outcry, the company announced it would review its policy.
*In mid-2014, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission took legal action against Virgin Australia in respect of drip pricing.
* In 2020, Perth Airport staff parked heavy vehicles and heavy equipment in front of some Virgin Australia aircraft to prevent them from moving, owing to unpaid debts accumulated by the airline throughout 2020.

<text>Multnomah Falls is a waterfall located on Multnomah Creek in the Columbia River Gorge, east of Troutdale, between Corbett and Dodson, Oregon, United States. The waterfall is accessible from the Historic Columbia River Highway and Interstate 84. Spanning two tiers on basalt cliffs, it is the tallest waterfall in the state of Oregon at in height. The Multnomah Creek Bridge, built in 1914, crosses below the falls, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The land surrounding the falls was developed by Simon Benson in the early-twentieth century, with a pathway, viewing bridge, and adjacent lodge being constructed in 1925. The Multnomah Falls Lodge and the surrounding footpaths at the falls were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Contemporarily, the state of Oregon maintains a switchback trail that ascends to a talus slope above the falls, and descends to an observation deck that overlooks the falls&#x27; edge. The falls attract over two million visitors each year, making it the most-visited natural recreation site in the U.S. Pacific Northwest.

==Structure==
The falls drops in two major steps, split into an upper falls of and a lower falls of , with a gradual 9 foot (3 m) drop in elevation between the two, so the total height of the waterfall is conventionally given as . The two drops are due to a zone of more easily eroded basalt at the base of the upper falls.

===Height===
Multnomah Falls is the tallest waterfall in the state of Oregon. It is credited by a sign at the site of the falls, and by the United States Forest Service, as the second tallest year-round waterfall in the United States. However, there has been some skepticism surrounding this distinction, as Multnomah Falls is listed as the 156th tallest waterfall in the United States by the World Waterfall Database (this site does not distinguish between seasonal and year-round waterfalls). The World Waterfall Database disputes claims that Multnomah Falls is the fourth-tallest waterfall in the United States, which has been claimed in such sources as the &quot;Encyclopedia of World Geography&quot; (2013).

===Water source===
Underground springs from Larch Mountain are the year-round source of water for the waterfall, augmented by spring runoff from the mountain&#x27;s snowpack and rainwater during the other seasons. This spring is the source of Multnomah Creek.

=== Benson Lake ===
Multnomah Creek drains into Benson Lake approximately 1,300 feet west of the bottom of the falls.

==History==
===Formation and early history===
The waterfall formed around 15,000 years ago at the end of a hanging valley, and was created by the Missoula floods. According to the creation story from the Multnomah tribe (from whom the falls take their name), the waterfall was formed after a young woman sacrificed herself to the Great Spirit to save a Multnomah village from a plague by jumping from the cliff, and the Multnomah peoples were saved. After her death, water began to flow from above the cliff, creating the waterfall.

The falls were noted in the journals of explorers William Clark and Meriwether Lewis during their expedition through the Columbia River Gorge in 1805. In an October 30 journal entry, Lewis notes: 

The origin of the falls&#x27; naming is unclear; scholar Lewis A. McArthur, in &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, suggested that S. G. Reed, a prominent mercantile clerk in Portland and native of Massachusetts, may have been the first to apply the name with the idea of popularizing sites along the Columbia River for steamboat excursions.

===Post-Reconstruction development===
Beginning in 1884, the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company operated a stop at Multnomah Falls on their railway, which spanned from Portland to Pasco, Washington; this stop continued to operate until World War II, and included a timber bowstring truss bridge that spanned the falls at the present bridge&#x27;s location. Around 1891, the bridge was reinforced, but was dismantled in 1899.
On January 28, 1915, Samuel C. Lancaster recommended to the Progressive Business Men&#x27;s Club of Portland that a trail be built from the base of Multnomah Falls extending to the top of Larch Mountain. The Club raised several hundred dollars to finance the trail, and Portland financier Simon Benson and his son Amos S. Benson pledged an additional $3,000. The United States Forest Service appropriated a total of $1,500 and agreed to survey and build the trail in addition to the lookout on Larch Mountain. Benson financed Italian stonemasons to construct a bridge at the falls to allow visitor access. This bridge, named the Benson Footbridge, spans the lower falls at a height of , and provides an expansive view of the upper falls.

On Labor Day 1915, Benson donated over of land which included most of the falls as well as nearby Wahkeena Falls, to the city of Portland. The Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company subsequently donated the land at the base of Multnomah Falls contingent upon their agreement that a would be constructed at the site the same year.
Late that year, architect A. E. Doyle, who designed Portland&#x27;s Meier &amp; Frank Building, was commissioned by the city to design the Multnomah Falls Lodge, which was completed in 1925. The lodge, built in a &quot;Cascadian&quot; architectural style using native split fieldstone laid irregularly. The building features a steeply-pitched cedar-shingled gable roof with dormers and large chimneys. In the early through the mid-twentieth century, the lodge provided both meals and lodging to travelers. Contemporarily, it provides meals, a gift shop, and an interpretive center. The lodge and footpaths were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.

==Access==

In contrast to other falls along the Gorge, the Multnomah Falls area is accessible via Interstate 84 east of Troutdale, Oregon, and is a &quot;designated scenic area&quot; by the state of Oregon. The falls are the most-visited natural recreation area in the Pacific Northwest, with over two million annual visitors. The rest area and tunnel under the road (as well as the Union Pacific Railroad tracks) allow Interstate travelers from either direction to stop and visit the falls. Columbia Area Transit operates the Columbia Gorge Express to Portland and Hood River.

During the summer season and holidays the parking lot along the freeway access can fill up very quickly which prompts a gate to come down and a reader board sign along the freeway before the offramp flashes that the parking lot is full.

Several tour providers offer a variety of ways to access Multnomah Falls from ebike rentals to waterfall shuttles that stop at all of the waterfalls near Multnomah Falls

===Footpaths===
A paved foot trail leads to Benson Footbridge, a 45-foot (14 m)-long footbridge that allows visitors to cross 105 feet (32 m) above the lower cascade. After a viewpoint of the upper falls, the trail continues to ascend to an elevation of ; it consists of eleven switchbacks which reach a forested talus slope above the falls. The trail then descends to an observation deck (elevation ) overlooking the falls&#x27; edge, providing visitors a bird&#x27;s-eye view of the Columbia Gorge and also of &quot;Little Multnomah&quot;, a small cascade slightly upstream from the &quot;upper&quot; falls, which is not visible from ground level.

There are a number of trail junctions along the footpaths ascending to the falls&#x27; observation deck, which allow access to a trail loop to other nearby waterfalls. The Mark O. Hatfield Memorial Trail, one of several, starts at the falls and continues through the Oregon side of the Columbia River Gorge to Starvation Creek.

==Maintenance concerns==
In 1991, a wildfire damaged over near the falls, and resulted in the closing of Perdition Trail, a hiking trail that branched off the main trail to the falls&#x27; observation deck. The trail is permanently closed and deemed unsafe for passage.

On Labor Day in September 1995, a 400-ton boulder, loosened by erosion, fell from the face of the waterfall into the upper cascade pool, above Benson Footbridge. It caused a splash of water and gravel to wash over the footbridge, causing minor injuries to twenty members of a wedding party that happened to be on the bridge posing for photos at the time.

On January 9, 2014, a falling rock damaged a portion of the bridge walkway and concrete railing, leading the Forest Service to close the bridge until repairs were completed.

In September 2017, the lodge was threatened by the Eagle Creek Fire in the Columbia River Gorge, which resulted in the lodge and fall access being closed to the public. The lodge reopened on November 29, 2017, though the U.S. Forest Service announced that footpath access to the waterfall would remain closed until an indeterminate date due to concerns over landslides. The trail to the Benson Bridge reopened in June 2018, while the remaining trails along upper Multnomah Creek and to Wahkeena Falls, the top of Larch Mountain, Devil&#x27;s Rest, and Angel&#x27;s Rest were repaired and reopened in November 2018.

==Multnomah Creek Bridge==

A five-ribbed spandrel bridge, the Multnomah Creek Bridge, was built in 1914 to bring what is now the Historic Columbia River Highway across Multnomah Creek below the falls. It is long and is a contributing structure in the highway&#x27;s listing on the National Register of Historic Places, and in its designation as a National Historic Landmark.

<text>Parasteatoda tepidariorum, the common house spider or American house spider, is a spider species of the genus &quot;Parasteatoda&quot; with a cosmopolitan distribution. Common house spiders are synanthropic and live in and near human dwellings. Their prey mechanism is similar to that of the other cobweb spiders: the spider follows disturbances transmitted along the web to entangle and then paralyze its prey, which usually consists of household insects and other invertebrates (often considered as pests).

==Description==
===Appearance===
Common house spiders are variable in color from tan to nearly black, frequently with patterns of differing shades on their body. Females are generally between long, and males are generally between long. They can be an inch (2.5 cm) or more across with legs outspread. &quot;P. tepidariorum&quot; is similar in body shape to widow spiders. Males have a less bulbous abdomen than females. Common house spiders&#x27; size and coloration allow the spiders to blend into the background and escape notice.

===Life cycle===
This species can live for more than a year after reaching maturity. Females suspend their egg sacs in their webs; the spherical egg sacs have a tan papery outer layer. Each egg sac contains from 150200 eggs, with a single female producing 1520 egg sacs in its lifetime. The spiderlings remain in the mother&#x27;s web for several days after coming out of the egg sac.

===Diet and predation===
Common house spiders usually feed on small insects and household pests. If the prey is too agile, the spider will try shooting web at it from a distance before pulling the thread toward itself. Bigger females can also attract baby skinks inside their web by leaving fly remains hanging in it. Once its food dries out, the spider usually drops it to the floor in order to free space in its web, instead of destroying and rebuilding it or changing its location.

Three spider species usually prey upon them: the pirate spiders of the genus &quot;Mimetus&quot; (Mimetidae), as well as two jumping spider species – &quot;Phidippus variegatus&quot; and &quot;Platycryptus undatus&quot;. The latter one often falls prey to its own food when it gets trapped in the tangling web after missing the jump on its target. 

The assassin bug &quot;Stenolemus lanipes&quot; (Emesinae) apparently feeds exclusively on spiderlings of this species, but can also become prey of the adult spider.

==Behavior==
===Interaction with other spiders===

A male and female often share the same web for long periods, and several females often build their webs in close proximity. However, females will sometimes fight when they encounter each other.

===Interaction with humans and predators===
As these spiders live in constant proximity to humans, they are not usually aggressive and will even let a human hand approach their web. Common house spiders will bite humans only in self-defense, when grabbed and squeezed. The species&#x27; synanthropic habits, however, increase the risk of human bites.

Common house spiders possess poor vision and cannot detect any movement more than three to four inches away. If cornered, they will feign death as last resort.

===Toxicity===
Common house spiders have neurotoxic venom. However, their bites are less severe than that of other theridiids and are &quot;not known to be dangerous to humans&quot;.

== Subspecies ==
Subspecies include &quot;P. tepidariorum australis&quot; (common gray house spider).

<text>Santo Bugito is an American animated television series produced and developed by Klasky-Csupo for CBS and created by Arlene Klasky. It ran for thirteen episodes and revolved around the goings on in a fictional community of insects. The show was advertised as the first Tex-Mex cartoon.

Notable achievements of this series included a revival of the insect-community genre (little of which had been seen since &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot;), and voice cameos from well known performers such as Jim Belushi. The regular cast included Tony Plana, William Sanderson, Henry Gibson, George Kennedy, Cheech Marin and Joan Van Ark.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Santo Bugito&quot; is set in a titular border town between Texas and Mexico, populated by various anthropomorphic insects. Carmen De La Antchez (Marabina Jaimes) is the show&#x27;s protagonist, an ant who runs a restaurant in the town with her husband, Paco (Tony Plana). The town is populated by other insects, including two brash American flies, Clem (William Sanderson) and Burt (Michael Stanton), a hyperactive flea named Lencho (Cheech Marin), a cynical artist termite named Eaton Woode (Charles Adler), a butterfly named Rosa (Candi Milo) and her boyfriend Miguel who is still in his cocoon, Amelia (Joan Van Ark), an enthusiastic damselfly, Ralph, a large friendly ladybug with a deep voice (George Kennedy) and a praying mantis professor who occasionally interrupts the show to give dull educational lectures, but is usually pushed off-screen by another character.

The show primarily deals with slice of life stories, but often with a strange insect twist. Some episodes include the town still trying to operate when Carmen is bedridden with a broken leg (&quot;The Carmen Tango&quot;), Lencho trying to attract a famous black widow spider dancer to perform in the town (&quot;A Widow Goes a Long Way&quot;), and one where a mosquito lawyer named Emma Squito comes to town, and everyone in the town is caught up in a suing frenzy, in exchange for Emma sucking the blood from each of her clients (&quot;Sue City&quot;). A mariachi band of ants occasionally narrate the action with music.

<doc id="346120" wikidata="Q650114" url="?curid=346120" title="Cetti's warbler">
<text>Cetti&#x27;s warbler (Cettia cetti) is a small, brown bush-warbler which breeds in southern and central Europe, northwest Africa and the east Palearctic as far as Afghanistan and northwest Pakistan. The sexes are alike. The bird is named after the 18th century Italian zoologist, Francesco Cetti. This species is very difficult to see because of its skulking habits.

==Taxonomy==
Cetti&#x27;s warbler was described in 1820 by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck from specimens collected by Alberto della Marmora in Sardinia. Temminck coined the binomial name &quot;Sylvia cetti&quot;. The specific epithet was chosen to commemorate the Italian zoologist Francesco Cetti. Cetti&#x27;s warbler is now placed in the genus &quot;Cettia&quot; that was erected in 1834 by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte with Cetti&#x27;s warbler as the type species.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. c. cetti&quot; (Temminck, 1820) – west Europe to Greece and the Balkans, northwest Africa
* &quot;C. c. orientalis&quot; Tristram, 1867 – Turkey to Iran and Afghanistan
* &quot;C. c. albiventris&quot; Severtsov, 1873 – Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northwest China and north Afghanistan

==Description==
Cetti&#x27;s warbler is approximately from bill to tail. The male weighs and the female . Cetti&#x27;s warbler has a rounded head with a narrow pale grey stripe arching over conspicuous black eyes, and short, rounded wings. The upperparts are a rich chestnut or dark reddish-brown; the throat and breast are pale grey. The tail is longer and broader than many other warblers.
The sexes have similar plumage, but males are 26% to 32% heavier than females with a wing-length 11.2% to 13% longer. The male has a wing longer than 60 mm; the female has a wing shorter than 55 mm. The birds can be aged by their plumage; juveniles look similar to adults but have fresh plumage and two dark or dark grey spots on the tongue. Cetti&#x27;s warbler is unusual among passerine birds in having ten tail feathers (rectrices) rather than the usual twelve.

Cetti&#x27;s warblers signal their presence with loud song. Their song is distinct, comes in loud bursts, and has a unique structure that allows the birds to avoid mating with other species.

==Distribution and habitat==
Cetti&#x27;s warbler usually inhabits damp areas including ponds, lakes, marshes and rivers. It is insectivorous.

The number of Cetti&#x27;s warblers has greatly increased across Europe since 1990. The current population of Cetti&#x27;s warblers in Europe is estimated to be about pairs. The populations in Italy and Turkey are known to be stable or increasing. The exception to the general positive European population trend is Greece, where the population decreased slightly between 1990 and 2000. However, overall, Cetti&#x27;s warblers are evaluated as secure. Cetti&#x27;s warbler was first recorded in the United Kingdom in 1961. The UK population of Cetti&#x27;s warblers fell by over a third between 1984 and 1986 following a severe winter, but rebounded rapidly thereafter. Populations continue to grow; by 2016 there were over 3,400 territorial males, distributed throughout most of England and Wales, with the first breeding in Scotland in 2023. It was first recorded in Ireland in 2013, with the first breeding in 2022.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
During the summer, the males spend most of their time establishing their territories. While doing this, they spend little amount of time caring for the eggs or young. Afterwards, the males usually attract more than one female to their territory. Their song plays an important role.

In Europe the main period for egg laying is from the middle to the end of June. The nest is placed in thick dense vegetation usually at around above the ground. 
The untidy cup shaped nest is made from leaves and stems and is lined with feathers, hair and other finer material. It is built entirely by the female. The eggs are laid in the early morning at daily intervals and are chestnut red in colour. The clutch consists of 4 to 5 eggs which measure approximately . The eggs are incubated by the female beginning when the clutch is complete and hatch after 16 to 17 days. The young are mainly fed and brooded by the female. They fledge after 14 to 16 days but continue to be fed by the parents for at least another 15 days. The young become independent by 30 days. In Europe Cetti&#x27;s warblers normally have two broods each year. They first breed when one year of age.

===Feeding===
Cetti&#x27;s warbler preys on arthropods such as small, soft-bodied insects and larvae. Cetti&#x27;s warblers prefer tiny insects because they can digest them faster.

<text>In the context of systems science and systems philosophy, systemics is an initiative to study systems. It is an attempt at developing logical, mathematical, engineering and philosophical paradigms and frameworks in which physical, technological, biological, social, cognitive and metaphysical systems can be studied and modeled.

The term &quot;systemics&quot; was coined in the 1970s by Mario Bunge and others, as an alternative paradigm for research related to general systems theory and systems science.

<doc id="346133" wikidata="Q188721" url="?curid=346133" title="Annihilation">
<text>In particle physics, annihilation is the process that occurs when a subatomic particle collides with its respective antiparticle to produce other particles, such as an electron colliding with a positron to produce two photons. The total energy and momentum of the initial pair are conserved in the process and distributed among a set of other particles in the final state. Antiparticles have exactly opposite additive quantum numbers from particles, so the sums of all quantum numbers of such an original pair are zero. Hence, any set of particles may be produced whose total quantum numbers are also zero as long as conservation of energy, conservation of momentum, and conservation of spin are obeyed.

During a low-energy annihilation, photon production is favored, since these particles have no mass. High-energy particle colliders produce annihilations where a wide variety of exotic heavy particles are created.

The word &quot;annihilation&quot; takes its use informally for the interaction of two particles that are not mutual antiparticles not charge conjugate. Some quantum numbers may then not sum to zero in the initial state, but conserve with the same totals in the final state. An example is the &quot;annihilation&quot; of a high-energy electron antineutrino with an electron to produce a W boson.

If the annihilating particles are composite, such as mesons or baryons, then several different particles are typically produced in the final state.

The inverse of annihilation is pair production, the process in which a high-energy photon converts its energy into mass.

==Production of a single boson==
If the initial two particles are elementary (not composite), then they may combine to produce only a single elementary boson, such as a photon (), gluon (), , or a Higgs boson (). If the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame is equal to the rest mass of a real boson (which is impossible for a massless boson such as the ), then that created particle will continue to exist until it decays according to its lifetime. Otherwise, the process is understood as the initial creation of a boson that is virtual, which immediately converts into a real particle + antiparticle pair. This is called an s-channel process. An example is the annihilation of an electron with a positron to produce a virtual photon, which converts into a muon and anti-muon. If the energy is large enough, a could replace the photon.

==Examples==
===Electron–positron annihilation===
:  +  →  + 

When a low-energy electron annihilates a low-energy positron (antielectron), the most probable result is the creation of two or more photons, since the only other final-state Standard Model particles that electrons and positrons carry enough mass–energy to produce are neutrinos, which are approximately 10,000 times less likely to produce, and the creation of only one photon is forbidden by momentum conservation—a single photon would carry nonzero momentum in any frame, including the center-of-momentum frame where the total momentum vanishes. Both the annihilating electron and positron particles have a rest energy of about 0.511 million electron-volts (MeV). If their kinetic energies are relatively negligible, this total rest energy appears as the photon energy of the photons produced. Each of the photons then has an energy of about 0.511 MeV. Momentum and energy are both conserved, with 1.022 MeV of photon energy (accounting for the rest energy of the particles) moving in opposite directions (accounting for the total zero momentum of the system).

If one or both charged particles carry a larger amount of kinetic energy, various other particles can be produced. Furthermore, the annihilation (or decay) of an electron–positron pair into a &quot;single&quot; photon can occur in the presence of a third charged particle, to which the excess momentum can be transferred by a virtual photon from the electron or positron. The inverse process, pair production by a single real photon, is also possible in the electromagnetic field of a third particle.

===Proton–antiproton annihilation===
When a proton encounters its antiparticle (and more generally, if any species of baryon encounters the corresponding antibaryon), the reaction is not as simple as electron–positron annihilation. Unlike an electron, a proton is a composite particle consisting of three &quot;valence quarks&quot; and an indeterminate number of &quot;sea quarks&quot; bound by gluons. Thus, when a proton encounters an antiproton, one of its quarks, usually a constituent valence quark, may annihilate with an antiquark (which more rarely could be a sea quark) to produce a gluon, after which the gluon together with the remaining quarks, antiquarks, and gluons will undergo a complex process of rearrangement (called hadronization or fragmentation) into a number of mesons, (mostly pions and kaons), which will share the total energy and momentum. The newly created mesons are unstable, and unless they encounter and interact with some other material, they will decay in a series of reactions that ultimately produce only photons, electrons, positrons, and neutrinos. This type of reaction will occur between any baryon (particle consisting of three quarks) and any antibaryon consisting of three antiquarks, one of which corresponds to a quark in the baryon. (This reaction is unlikely if at least one among the baryon and anti-baryon is exotic enough that they share no constituent quark flavors.) Antiprotons can and do annihilate with neutrons, and likewise antineutrons can annihilate with protons, as discussed below.

Reactions in which proton–antiproton annihilation produces as many as 9 mesons have been observed, while production of 13 mesons is theoretically possible. The generated mesons leave the site of the annihilation at moderate fractions of the speed of light and decay with whatever lifetime is appropriate for their type of meson.

Similar reactions will occur when an antinucleon annihilates within a more complex atomic nucleus, save that the resulting mesons, being strongly interacting, have a significant probability of being absorbed by one of the remaining &quot;spectator&quot; nucleons rather than escaping. Since the absorbed energy can be as much as ~2 GeV, it can in principle exceed the binding energy of even the heaviest nuclei. Thus, when an antiproton annihilates inside a heavy nucleus such as uranium or plutonium, partial or complete disruption of the nucleus can occur, releasing large numbers of fast neutrons. Such reactions open the possibility for triggering a significant number of secondary fission reactions in a subcritical mass and may potentially be useful for spacecraft propulsion.

===Higgs production===
In collisions of two nucleons at very high energies, sea quarks and gluons tend to dominate the interaction rate, so neither nucleon need be an anti-particle for annihilation of a quark pair or &quot;fusion&quot; of two gluons to occur. Examples of such processes contribute to the production of the long-sought Higgs boson. The Higgs is directly produced very weakly by annihilation of light (valence) quarks, but heavy or sea or produced quarks are available. In 2012, the CERN laboratory in Geneva announced the discovery of the Higgs in the debris from proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The strongest Higgs yield is from fusion of two gluons (via annihilation of a heavy quark pair), while two quarks or antiquarks produce more easily identified events through radiation of a Higgs by a produced virtual vector boson or annihilation of two such vector bosons.

<text>The Egg and I, first published in 1945, is a humorous memoir by American author Betty MacDonald about her adventures and travels as a young wife on a chicken farm on the Olympic Peninsula in the US state of Washington. The book is based on the author&#x27;s experiences as a newlywed trying to acclimate to and operate a small chicken farm near Chimacum, Washington, with her first husband, Robert Heskett, from 1927 to 1931. On visits with her family in Seattle, she told stories of their tribulations, which greatly amused them. In the 1940s, MacDonald&#x27;s older sister, Mary, strongly encouraged her to write a book about these experiences. &quot;The Egg and I&quot; was MacDonald&#x27;s first attempt at writing a book.

==Plot==
MacDonald begins her book with a summary description of her childhood and family. Her father was a mining engineer, and moved frequently with his family throughout the West. Her mother&#x27;s theory that a wife must support her husband in his career comes into play when the author marries a friend of her brother (Bob), who soon admits that his dream is to leave his current office job and start a chicken ranch. Knowing nothing about farming, but eager to support her husband, the author encourages the dream, but is unprepared for the primitive conditions that exist on the farm he purchases.

From this &quot;set-up&quot;, the book turns to anecdotal stories that rely upon the proverbial &quot;fish out of water&quot; tales that pit MacDonald against her situation and her surroundings, such as the struggle to keep up with the need for water, which needs to be hand carried from a pond to the house until a tank is installed, or keeping a fire going in &quot;Stove&quot;, or the constant care that chicks need. At one point, a guest expresses envy of MacDonald and her husband, imagining that they live a life full of fresh air and beautiful scenery, whereupon MacDonald notes that while the guest had lounged in bed that morning, she and her husband had been up before sunrise working for several hours, and then again worked long into the night after the guest had gone to bed.

MacDonald chronicles the gradual improvements to the primitive farmhouse, such as the arrival of electricity and running water. The neighbors and townspeople are also described in the book. The &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; characters are near neighbors to the MacDonalds.

==Release==
First published by the J. B. Lippincott Company on October 3, 1945, &quot;The Egg and I&quot; received laudatory reviews and soon appeared on the best-seller list. The book was a blockbuster success, being reprinted on a nearly monthly basis for the next two years.

On September 12, 1946, the specially bound one-millionth copy of the book was presented to MacDonald by Washington Governor Monrad Wallgren at a luncheon in Seattle.

&quot;The Egg and I&quot; was reprinted in a short-run hardback edition in 1986 as well as reprinted under the Harper Perennial paperback imprint.

&quot;The Egg and I&quot; has sold more than three million copies, and has been translated into 32 languages.

==Adaptations==

In April 1946, Universal-International announced the purchase of the film rights for &quot;The Egg and I&quot; for $100,000, plus a percentage of profits. Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray were cast in the lead roles, with Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride cast in the roles of Ma and Pa Kettle. The film, loosely based on the book, was released in 1947. Main received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and the film inspired nine subsequent &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; features.

A 15-minute daytime TV series based on the book aired on CBS from September 3, 1951, to August 1, 1952. The program starred Bob Craven and Patricia Kirkland.

==Criticism==

Although the book was a critical and popular success at publication, it has been criticized for its racist treatment of Native Americans. In 2005, a literary critic examining MacDonald&#x27;s body of work wrote, “Without overcoming or correcting the racism in &quot;Egg&quot;, her stories in her subsequent books describe and implicitly advocate the benefits of a multicultural society (especially those available in an urban space like Seattle).

&quot;The Egg and I&quot; has also been claimed to have &quot;spawned a perception of Washington as a land of eccentric country bumpkins like Ma and Pa Kettle.&quot; MacDonald&#x27;s defenders point out that in the context of the 1940s, such stereotyping was far more acceptable. MacDonald faced two lawsuits over the book’s content (see below); plaintiffs did not prevail, although the judge indicated he felt they had shown that some of the claims of defamation had merit.

==Post-publication lawsuits==
Following the success of the book and film, lawsuits were filed by members of the Chimacum community. They claimed that characters in &quot;The Egg and I&quot; had been based on them, and that they had been identified in their community as the real-life versions of those characters, subjecting them to ridicule and humiliation. The family of Albert and Susanna Bishop claimed they had been negatively portrayed as the Kettles. Their oldest son Edward and his wife Ilah Bishop filed the first lawsuit, which was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

The second lawsuit was filed against MacDonald, publisher J. B. Lippincott Company, and The Bon Marché (a Seattle department store which had promoted and distributed the book) for total damages of $975,000, as sought by nine other members of the Bishop family ($100,000 each) and Raymond H. Johnson ($75,000), who claimed he had been portrayed as the Indian &quot;Crowbar&quot;. The case was heard before a jury in Judge William J. Willkins&#x27; (who was also one of the presiding judges at the Nuremberg Trials) courtroom in King County Superior Court beginning February 6, 1951. MacDonald testified that the characters in her book were composite sketches of various people she had met. The defense produced evidence that the Bishop family had actually been trying to profit from the fame the book and movie had brought them, including testimony that son Walter Bishop had had his father Albert appear onstage at his Belfair, Washington, dance hall with chickens under his arm, introducing him as &quot;Pa Kettle&quot;. On February 10, 1951, the jury decided in favor of the author.

==In popular culture==

Recordings of the theme song from the film were made by Sammy Kaye for Victor, and Dinah Shore for Columbia.

The road leading west from Beaver Valley Road (State Route 19) to the former site of MacDonald&#x27;s farm is now named &quot;Egg and I Road&quot;.

The Egg and I is the name of a breakfast restaurant with around 100 locations nationwide. The owners were inspired by the book.

<text>Betty MacDonald (born Anne Elizabeth Campbell Bard; March 26, 1907 – February 7, 1958) was an American author who specialized in humorous autobiographical tales, and is best known for her book &quot;The Egg and I&quot;. She also wrote the &quot;Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&quot; series of children&#x27;s books. She is associated with the Pacific Northwest, especially Washington.

==Life and work==
MacDonald was born in Boulder, Colorado. Her official birth date is given as March 26, 1908, although federal census returns seem to indicate 1907. Her parents were Harvard-educated mining engineer Darsie Bard and his wife Elsie Sanderson, called Sydney. Betty had three sisters: Mary Bard, Dorothea Bard, and Alison Bard; and one brother, Sydney Cleveland Bard. In adulthood, MacDonald&#x27;s sister Mary Bard (Jensen) was also a published author. (Another sister, Sylvia, died in infancy.) Betty Bard spent her childhood in Mexico, Montana, and Idaho.

Her family moved to the north slope of Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill neighborhood in 1918, moving to the Laurelhurst neighborhood a year later and finally settling in the Roosevelt neighborhood in 1922, where she graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1924.

MacDonald attended the University of Washington for one year before she married Robert Eugene Heskett (1895–1951) at age 20 in July 1927; they lived on a chicken farm in the Olympic Peninsula&#x27;s Chimacum Valley, near Center and a few miles south of Port Townsend. She left Heskett in 1931 and filed for divorce. Upon returning to Seattle, she worked at a variety of jobs to support their daughters Anne and Joan. After the divorce the ex-spouses had virtually no contact. Heskett died in 1951 after being “stabbed in a fight.” She spent nine months at Firland Sanatorium near Seattle in 1937–1938 for treatment of tuberculosis. On April 24, 1942 she married Donald C. MacDonald (1910–1975) and moved to Vashon Island, where she wrote most of her books. 

MacDonald rose to fame when her first book, &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, was published in 1945. It first appeared as a serialized abridgement in the June through August, 1945, issues of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. The book, published on October 3, 1945, was number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; non-fiction bestseller list for 43 weeks International Pictures bought the movie rights for $100,000 in 1946. 

In the film of &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, made in 1947, MacDonald was played by Claudette Colbert. Her husband (simply called &quot;Bob&quot; in the book) was called &quot;Bob MacDonald&quot; in the film, as studio executives were keen not to raise the matter of MacDonald&#x27;s divorce in the public consciousness. He was played by Fred MacMurray. The books introduced the characters Ma and Pa Kettle, who also were featured in the movie version of &quot;The Egg and I&quot;. The characters become so popular a series of nine more films were made featuring them.

MacDonald also published three other semi-autobiographical books:

* &quot;The Plague and I&quot; (1948), describing her nine-month stay at the Firlands tuberculosis sanitarium; the character of Kimi is the writer Monica Sone. MacDonald helped launch Sone’s writing career and appears as “Chris” in Sone’s book &quot;Nisei Daughter&quot;. Plague was said to be MacDonald’s favorite of her own books. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer said of &quot;Plague&quot;: “Betty MacDonald…apparently can extract more amusement out of a nasty experience than most people can corral out from a trip to the circus…the artistry of her style, the infectious gaiety of her perspective, and the sensitive understanding she extends to any person she comes in contact with…assures a good deal of pleasure and vital knowledge even though as a subject the plague’s the thing.” In 1984 a different &quot;New York Times&quot; writer called it “undeservedly forgotten.”
* &quot;Anybody Can Do Anything&quot; (1950), recounting her life in the Depression trying to find work, in the years after she left her husband and moved back in with her mother and sister; this book is notable as “an explicit appreciation of a western place” (Seattle in the 1930s.) Betty, who can’t type or do shorthand, “hires out as a secretary and a stenographer…and hunts in the poverty-stricken thirties for other jobs, some of which she applies [for] and some of which she tries: Tinting photos, clerking for florist, dentist, gangster, credit bureau, and a dime-card chain scheme.”
* &quot;Onions in the Stew&quot; (1955), about her life in a log cabin by the ferry landing on Vashon Island with her second husband and teenage daughters during the war years. The farm, which has a “breathtaking view of Puget Sound, lush fruit trees and bald eagles nesting just outside the windows,” is now a bed and breakfast with a small museum dedicated to MacDonald.

She also wrote the &quot;Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&quot; series of children&#x27;s books and another children&#x27;s book, &quot;Nancy and Plum&quot;, which was described upon publication as being “steeped in the essence of old fairy tales.”

The MacDonalds moved to California&#x27;s Carmel Valley in 1956. MacDonald returned to Seattle in September 1957 for cancer treatment and died there of uterine cancer on February 7, 1958. 

A posthumous collection of her writings, entitled &quot;Who, Me?: The Autobiography of Betty MacDonald&quot;, was later released.

All the Bard siblings are deceased. MacDonald&#x27;s younger daughter, Joan MacDonald Keil, died in July 2005.

==Legacy==
MacDonald has been described as “one of the most accomplished and popular humorists of the era.”

In 2007, MacDonald&#x27;s daughter, Anne MacDonald Canham, published &quot;Happy Birthday, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&quot;, based on stories and characters created by her mother. The book is attributed to both mother and daughter.

On March 13, 2008, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a tribute program, commemorating the 100th anniversary of McDonald&#x27;s birth. In 2009, BBC Radio 4 also broadcast a reading of MacDonald&#x27;s book, &quot;Anybody Can Do Anything&quot;.

In September 2016, Annie Parnell, MacDonald&#x27;s great-granddaughter, published a follow-up to the series, &quot;Missy Piggle-Wiggle and the Whatever Cure&quot; in conjunction with Ann M. Martin, with illustrations by Ben Hatke.

&quot;The Egg &amp; I&quot; and the &quot;Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&quot; books are still in print from Harper &amp; Row; her other three memoir books have been republished multiple times, most recently by University of Washington Press. &quot;Nancy and Plum&quot; was reprinted by MacDonald’s daughter Joan and son-in-law in 1998. A new edition with illustrations by Mary GrandPré has since been issued by Yearling.

<doc id="346152" wikidata="Q3890710" url="?curid=346152" title="Mary Hays (American Revolutionary War)">
<text>Mary Ludwig Hays (October 13, 1754 – January 22, 1832) was a woman who fought in the American War of Independence at the Battle of Monmouth. The woman behind the Molly Pitcher story is most often identified as Hays, but it is likely that the legend is an amalgam of more than one woman seen on the battlefield that day.

== Life and military career == 
Mary Ludwig was born in Trenton, New Jersey, British America. There is some dispute over her birth date, but a marker in the cemetery where she is buried lists her birth date as October 13, 1754. She had a moderately sized family which included her older brother Johann Martin; their parents were Maria Margaretha and Johann George Ludwig, who was a butcher. It is likely that she never attended school or learned to read, as education was uncommon among girls at this time.

Her father died in January 1769, and her mother married John Hays the following June. In early 1777, Mary married William Hays, a barber in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Continental Army records show that he was an artilleryman at the Battle of Monmouth in 1778. Dr. William Irvine organized a boycott of British goods as a protest of the Tea Act on July 12, 1774, in a meeting in the Presbyterian Church in Carlisle, and William Hays&#x27; name appears on a list of people who were charged with enforcing it.

=== Valley Forge ===
In 1777, William Hays enlisted in Proctor&#x27;s 4th Pennsylvania Artillery, which became Proctor&#x27;s 4th Artillery of the Continental Army. During the winter of 1777, Mary Hays joined her husband at the Continental Army&#x27;s winter camp at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. She was one of a group of women, led by Martha Washington, who would wash clothes and blankets, and care for sick and dying soldiers.

In early 1778, the Continental Army trained under Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben. Hays trained as an artilleryman, and Mary and other camp followers served as water carriers, carrying water to troops who were drilling on the field. Also, artillerymen needed a supply of water to soak the sponge used to clean sparks and gunpowder out of the barrel after each shot. It was during this time that Mary probably received her nickname, as troops would shout, &quot;Molly! Pitcher!&quot; whenever they needed her to bring fresh water. 

=== Battle of Monmouth ===
At the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778, Mary Hays attended to the soldiers by giving them water. Just before the battle started, she found a spring to serve as her supply, and two places on the battlefield are now marked as the &quot;Molly Pitcher Spring.&quot; She spent much of the early day carrying water to soldiers and artillerymen.

The weather was very hot, and William Hays collapsed during the battle, either wounded or suffering from heat exhaustion. It has often been reported that he was killed in the battle, but it is known that he survived. As he was carried off the battlefield, Mary took his place at the cannon and continued to &quot;swab and load&quot; the cannon using her husband&#x27;s ramrod. At one point, a British musket ball or cannonball flew between her legs and tore off the bottom of her skirt. She supposedly said something to the effect of, &quot;Well, that could have been worse,&quot; and went back to loading the cannon.

Joseph Plumb Martin recalls an incident in his memoirs, writing that at the Battle of Monmouth, &quot;A woman whose husband belonged to the artillery and who was then attached to a piece in the engagement, attended with her husband at the piece the whole time. While in the act of reaching a cartridge and having one of her feet as far before the other as she could step, a cannon shot from the enemy passed directly between her legs without doing any other damage than carrying away all the lower part of her petticoat. Looking at it with apparent unconcern, she observed that it was lucky it did not pass a little higher, for in that case it might have carried away something else, and continued her occupation.&quot; However, there is no mention of the woman Martin describes serving the gun crews with water, nor of her husband becoming a casualty.

Later in the evening, the fighting was stopped due to gathering darkness. Although George Washington and his commanders expected the battle to continue the following day, the British forces retreated during the night and continued on to Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

After the battle, General Washington asked about the woman whom he had seen loading a cannon on the battlefield. In commemoration of her courage, he issued Mary Hays a warrant as a non commissioned officer. Afterward, she was known as &quot;Sergeant Molly,&quot; a nickname that she used for the rest of her life.

=== Later life and death ===

Following the end of the war, Mary Hays and her husband William returned to Carlisle, Pennsylvania. During this time, Mary gave birth to a son named Johannes (or John). In late 1786, William Hays died.

In 1793, Mary Hays married John McCauley, another Revolutionary War veteran and possibly a friend of William Hays. McCauley was a stone cutter for the local Carlisle prison. However, the marriage was reportedly not a happy one, as McCauley had a violent temper. It was McCauley who was the cause of Mary&#x27;s financial downfall, causing Mary to sell of bounty land left to her by William Hays, for 30 dollars. Sometime between 1807 and 1810, McCauley disappeared, and it is not known what happened to him.

Mary McCauley continued to live in Carlisle. She earned her living as a general servant for hire, cleaning and painting houses, washing windows and caring for children and sick people. &quot;Sergeant Molly,&quot; as she was known, was often seen in the streets of Carlisle wearing a striped skirt, wool stockings, and a ruffled cap. She was well-liked by the people of Carlisle, even though she &quot;often cursed like a soldier.&quot;

On February 21, 1822, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania awarded Mary McCauley an annual pension of $40 () for her service. Mary died January 22, 1832, in Carlisle, at the approximate age of 87. She is buried in the Old Graveyard in Carlisle under the name &quot;Molly McCauley&quot;. A statue of &quot;Molly Pitcher,&quot; standing alongside a cannon, is also in the cemetery. But according to this same monument--unveiled July 4, 1876, long after Mary/&quot;Molly&quot;&#x27;s death--the year she died is marked &quot;January 1833,&quot; not January 1832. And the monument also records she was only &quot;Aged 70 years,&quot; which (probably erroneously) would place her birth year at 1763, instead of 1754 as noted here.

==The Molly Pitcher story==

Molly was a common nickname for women named Mary in the Revolutionary time period. Biographical information about Mary Hays has been gathered by historians, including her cultural heritage, given name, probable year of birth, marriages, progeny, and census and tax records, providing a reasonably reliable account of her life.
Historian Emily Teipe notes that the deeds in the story of Molly Pitcher are generally attributed to Mary Ludwig Hays. However, she has also pointed out &#x27;The historical record presents other candidates too numerous to mention&#x27; and contends that &#x27;the name Molly Pitcher is a collective generic term&#x27;, serving as a common label for the &#x27;hundreds, perhaps thousands, of women (who) served not only as ammunition wives, manning and firing the guns, but also in the army and colonial militia&#x27;.

== Commemorations ==

Mary Ludwig Hays is commemorated, and named as Molly Pitcher, on the Monmouth Battle Monument in Freehold, New Jersey, and on her grave in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

The Monmouth battlefield also has a stone marking the Molly Pitcher Spring.

A rest stop or &quot;service area&quot; on the New Jersey Turnpike, in the town of Cranbury, NJ is named for Molly Pitcher.

A mural depicting Mary in battle was painted in the Freehold post office as a WPA project. It was moved to the Monmouth County Library headquarters when the post office closed.

<text>The Historic Columbia River Highway is an approximately scenic highway in the U.S. state of Oregon between Troutdale and The Dalles, built through the Columbia River Gorge between 1913 and 1922. As the first planned scenic roadway in the United States, it has been recognized in numerous ways, including being listed on the National Register of Historic Places, being designated as a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, being designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers, and being considered a &quot;destination unto itself&quot; as an All-American Road by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. The historic roadway was bypassed by the present Columbia River Highway No. 2 (Interstate 84) from the 1930s to the 1950s, leaving behind the old two-lane road. The road is now mostly owned and maintained by the state through the Oregon Department of Transportation as the Historic Columbia River Highway No. 100 (still partially marked as U.S. Route 30; see Oregon highways and routes) or the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department as the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail.
The original highway was promoted by lawyer and entrepreneur Sam Hill and engineer Samuel C. Lancaster, to be modeled after the great scenic roads of Europe. From the very beginning, the roadway was envisioned not just as means of traveling by the then popular Model T, but designed with an elegance that took full advantage of all the natural beauty along the route.

When the United States highway system was officially established in 1926, the highway became the part of U.S. Route 30. Since then, modern Interstate 84 has been built parallel to the highway between Portland and The Dalles, replacing it as the main travel route and resulting in the loss of some of the original sections of road.

==History==

===Planning and construction===
The Columbia River Gorge is the lowest crossing of the Cascade Mountains, carved by the Columbia River during the Cascades&#x27; uplift. Rafting down the gorge from The Dalles was one of the most expensive and dangerous parts of the Oregon Trail, traveled by thousands of emigrants to the Oregon Territory, until the Barlow Road opened in 1846 around the south side of Mount Hood. A wagon road was finally built through the gorge in the 1870s, when The Dalles and Sandy Wagon Road was constructed along the south shore from The Dalles to the Sandy River east of Portland. However, this road had steep (20%) grades and a crooked and narrow alignment, and it was not until 1882 that the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company finally opened a water-level route, partially destroying the wagon road. With the onset of the automobile and the good roads movement of the early 20th century, a road was once again needed, and Multnomah County began constructing a 20-foot (6 m) roadway with 9% grades, but ran into difficulties relating to the railroad&#x27;s location. At Shellrock Mountain to the east, long believed to be an impassable barrier, Governor Oswald West used prison labor in 1912 to prove that it was possible to build a road, at least temporarily.
The eventual highway was primarily designed by engineer and landscape architect Samuel C. Lancaster, a lifelong friend of good roads promoter Samuel Hill. His first contribution to the Pacific Northwest was as a consultant for Seattle&#x27;s Olmsted boulevard system, part of its preparations for the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. In 1908, the two traveled to Europe for the First International Road Congress, where Hill represented the state of Washington. Hill was especially impressed by Switzerland&#x27;s Axenstrasse, a road built along Lake Lucerne in 1865 that included a windowed tunnel, and wanted to build a similar scenic highway through the Columbia River Gorge. With Lancaster&#x27;s help, Hill built the experimental Maryhill Loops Road from the river east of the gorge up the Columbia Hills to his planned Quaker utopian community at Maryhill. The road was the first asphalt road in the state, designed with gradual horseshoe curves to avoid steep grades. However, Washington&#x27;s lawmakers denied his request for a cross-state trunk route on the river&#x27;s north bank, and Hill crossed the river to Oregon, the last of the states in the far Western U.S. to create a highway department. With the help of his life-size model at Maryhill, he convinced the state legislature to create the State Highway Commission in 1913, which would work with the counties to build roads. The Multnomah County commissioners agreed later that year that the state should design the route to distance it from county politics, and set aside an initial $75,000.
In laying out the highway, Lancaster sought not only to create a transportation artery, but to make the gorge&#x27;s &quot;beautiful waterfalls, canyons, cliffs and mountain domes&quot; accessible to &quot;men from all climes&quot;. According to locating engineer John Arthur Elliott,

Lancaster began surveying near the Chanticleer Inn, where Larch Mountain Road, part of Multnomah County&#x27;s existing road network, began climbing the hills of the gorge. For five months, from September 1913 to January 1914, he laid out a route for about 21 miles (34 km) to the Hood River County line west of Cascade Locks. The alignment generally had a maximum grade of 5% and curve radius of 200 feet (60 m), and was wide enough for 18 feet (5.5 m) of macadam (later asphalt) and two 3-foot (1 m) gravel shoulders. To accomplish this, Lancaster used curves similar to the road he had designed at Maryhill where the highway descended from Crown Point.
To carry rainwater off the road, Lancaster designed a comprehensive drainage system, including raising the center of the road, installing concrete curbs and gutters as on a city street, and taking the road over heavy flows on culverts. Eleven larger reinforced concrete bridges and several full or half viaducts were specially designed for the Multnomah County portion of the highway, taking the road over streams or along steep hillsides with a minimum of earthmoving. Masonry was used for retaining walls, which kept the highway from falling off the hillside, and guard walls, which kept drivers and pedestrians from falling off the road. At Oneonta Bluff, the highway passed through the first of five tunnels, as the land to the north was taken by the rail line. With the completion of the Oneonta Tunnel and a number of bridges, the road was open to traffic west of Warrendale, near Horsetail Falls, by October 1914. In April 1915, Multnomah County voters approved the cost of covering the initial macadam with a patented long-lasting bituminous mixture known as Warrenite, which was completed to the county line by the end of the summer.

For the section west of the Chanticleer Inn, Multnomah County generally made improvements to existing roads. Base Line Road (Stark Street) stretched east from Portland almost to the Sandy River; the roadway east of Troutdale Road to the river, including the present Sweetbriar Road, was somewhat circuitous. An old wooden Pratt through truss bridge over the Sandy collapsed on April 25, 1914, and its steel replacement was built as part of the Columbia River Highway project. A new extension of Base Line Road, built in 1915, gradually descended the riverbank to the bridge. Between the river and the inn, existing roads were incorporated into the highway, which bypassed other sections such as Nielson Road and Bell Road. The county built a second approach to the highway in 1916, using the existing Sandy Boulevard to Troutdale and a 1912 through truss bridge that connected to Woodard Road. A new roadway bypassed Woodard Road&#x27;s steep grades, following the riverbank to the east end of the 1914 bridge. The entire length of the highway in Multnomah County was maintained by the county until January 16, 1930, when the state took over maintenance of the Sandy Boulevard route. (Stark Street was never a state-maintained highway, though for a time it was signed as U.S. Route 30 Alternate.)
Beyond Multnomah County, State Highway Department engineer John Arthur Elliott surveyed a route along the river through Hood River County in 1913 and 1914, mostly using the 1870s wagon road where available. County voters approved a bond issue in mid-1914 to pay for construction west of the city of Hood River, helped by highway promoter Simon Benson&#x27;s purchase of the entire issue and promise to pay any overruns. The most difficult location was at Mitchell Point, where the old road included grades of up to 23% to take it over a saddle, and the railroad occupied the only available land between the cliff and the river. Elliott solved the problem by building the Mitchell Point Tunnel—a windowed tunnel like on Switzerland&#x27;s Axenstrasse—through the cliff, with a viaduct on the west approach. Construction began in March 1915, and the Mitchell Point section was opened to traffic in early September, at a cost of about $47,000. To dedicate the completed highway between Portland and Hood River, two ceremonies were held at Multnomah Falls and Crown Point on the same day in June 1916.
Between Hood River and The Dalles, construction was delayed by rugged terrain west of and debate over the best route east of Mosier. Elliott considered several options west of Mosier, including a route close to the railroad, which had again taken the best location along the river, and a route over the Mosier Hills, closer to the existing county road (now Old Dalles Drive and Hood River Road). The former, while shorter, would be, in Elliott&#x27;s words, &quot;passing a section made up of views which would leave a lasting impression on the traveler&quot;. Elliott had left the State Highway Department by 1917, when new locating engineer Roy A. Klein surveyed a third alignment. It was closer to the river than the old county road, yet higher than Elliott&#x27;s river alignment, in order to avoid closing the rail line during blasting. Just after leaving Hood River on a 1918 bridge over the Hood River, which had replaced an older wooden truss bridge, the highway climbed via a series of loops, similar to the ones at Crown Point. From there it followed the course of the river, partway up the hillside. Near the east end, the Mosier Twin Tunnels, completed in 1920, carried the road through a portion of the hill; the eastern of the two included two windows, similar to the five at Mitchell Point. Because of its beauty, photographers like William Henry Jackson, Benjamin A. Gifford, Arthur Prentiss and Carleton Watkins documented the construction of this highway.
The final piece to The Dalles was laid out by J. H. Scott of the State Highway Department. It followed an inland route, climbing existing county roads to the Rowena Crest, where it used a third set of loops to descend to river level at Rowena. There it picked up a former alignment of the Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company most of the way to The Dalles. Most of the bridges in Wasco County were designed by Conde McCullough, who would later become famous for his work on U.S. Route 101, the Oregon Coast Highway. A completion ceremony for the Columbia River Highway was held on June 27, 1922, when Simon Benson symbolically helped pave the final portion near Rowena. By then, the roadway was part of a longer Columbia River Highway, stretching from Astoria on the Pacific Ocean east to Pendleton as Highway No. 2 in a large network of state highways. In the State Highway Department&#x27;s fifth biennial report, published in 1922, it reported that construction costs to date on the Columbia River Highway totaled about $11 million, with the state contributing $7.6 million, the federal government $1.1 million, and the counties $2.3 million ($1.5 million of which was from Multnomah County). In 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials designated the road as part of U.S. Route 30. The first realignment was made by 1935 at the west entrance to The Dalles, where a more direct route along West 2nd Street bypassed the old alignment along West 6th Street, the Mill Creek Bridge, and West 3rd Place.

===Water-level bypass===

Even as construction was ongoing on the east end of the Columbia River Highway, the design had become obsolete, as motorists wanting to get to their destination greatly outnumbered tourists taking a pleasure drive. There were also problems with rockfall, especially west of the Mosier Twin Tunnels. By 1932, Lancaster proposed a new water-level route, while keeping the old road as a scenic highway. The first such bypass was necessitated by the federal government&#x27;s creation of Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River. The dam would flood the railroad, and the highway would need to be moved so the railroad could take its place. The highway&#x27;s new two-lane alignment, completed in 1937, crossed the old road several times between the community of Bonneville (just east of Tanner Creek) and Cascade Locks. The realignment had the effect of closing the old road to all but the most local of traffic, since the construction of the east portal of the new Toothrock Tunnel, just west of a new bridge over Eagle Creek, had destroyed a section of road on the hillside.
By the end of the 1940s, the original cross section of 18 feet (5.5 m) of pavement and two 3-foot (1 m) shoulders had been modified to 24 feet (7.5 m) of pavement. The Mosier Twin Tunnels were similarly widened from 8⅔ feet (2⅔ m) to 10 feet (3 m) in each direction in 1938 to accommodate larger trucks, but this was not enough, and traffic signals were later installed at the tunnels to regulate one-way traffic. A 1948 bypass of the Oneonta Tunnel was made possible by moving the railroad slightly north on fill; the railroad benefited by removing the risk of the thin tunnel wall collapsing onto the track. Oneonta Tunnel was sealed in 1948 but revealed again fifty-five years later as part of the Historic Columbia River Highway restoration project.
More comprehensive bypass planning began by 1941, when the State Highway Commission adopted surveys for the new highway.

===Restoration and current use===

Starting in June 2006, the Oregon Department of Transportation, using about $1.5 million in state and federal money, began restoring the Oneonta Tunnel to its 1920s appearance. The tunnel officially reopened March 21, 2009 for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

The Eagle Creek Fire swept through the Gorge in September 2017, causing rockslides that closed the historic highway for a year. The highway remained closed between Bridal Veil and Ainsworth State Park until November 23, 2018 for restoration and reconstruction work.

==Route description and historic designations==
Although the city of Troutdale has named the old highway &quot;Columbia River Highway&quot; west to 244th Avenue, where it is cut by I-84, signs for the scenic byway begin at exit 17 of I-84, and point south on Graham Road to the west end of downtown Troutdale. Modern milepoint zero of the Historic Columbia River Highway No. 100 is located at the west end of the Sandy River bridge, historic milepost 14.2.
















Modern highways, including I-84, and other developments have resulted in the abandonment of major sections of the historic original highway. In the interest of tourism and historical preservation, seventy-four miles of the original road—from Troutdale to The Dalles—have been established as the Historic Columbia River Highway (HCRH). Forty miles of the route are open to motor vehicles:
*The 24 westernmost miles starting in Troutdale (at the eastern edge of urban Portland) provide access to dozens of hiking trails, Crown Point Vista House, and numerous waterfalls such as Multnomah Falls. This section forms a loop with the Mount Hood Scenic Byway.
*The 16 easternmost miles ending in The Dalles.

The remaining portions of the HCRH designated for non-motorized use are now known as the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail. These are being developed as money becomes available. Roughly seven miles between Hood River and Mosier have been open to non-motorized traffic since 2000, passing through the historic Mosier Tunnels.

Once restoration is complete, the highway will serve as a scenic and alternative bicycle route for I-84 and US 30 between The Dalles and Portland. Currently, cyclists wishing to travel between these two towns must ride on the shoulders of I-84 for much of the distance, or the much more dangerous and narrow State Route 14 on the Washington side of the river.

The Columbia River Highway is the nation&#x27;s oldest scenic highway. In 1984 it was recognized as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. In 2000 it was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service as &quot;an outstanding example of modern highway development&quot;.

The Columbia River Highway Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It includes 38 contributing structures on .

<doc id="346160" wikidata="Q5894514" url="?curid=346160" title="Hong Kong Economic Journal">
<text>The Hong Kong Economic Journal (HKEJ). is a Chinese-language daily newspaper published in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong Economic Journal Co., Ltd.. Available in both Hong Kong and Macau, the newspaper mainly focuses on economic news and other related, usually political issues. The newsjournal is also available to some air passengers – those travelling to the United States, Canada, and Europe. It is authorised by the Hong Kong government to publish announcements related to some law issues.

==History==
The &quot;Hong Kong Economic Journal&quot; was founded by (), commonly known by his pen name Lam Hang-chi (), who first worked as a data collector for &quot;Ming Pao&quot; during the 1960s and later as an assistant editor for the evening version of &quot;Ming Pao&quot;—and Law Chi-Ping () – who withdrew his shares later. Together they saw the possibility of developing an economic journal for the Hong Kong public in the early 1970s (although some sources have suggested that it was Lok Yau-Mui (), his wife, and not Law Chi-Ping who was the true co-founder) and the newspaper was first published on 3 July 1973.
In July 2008, HKEJ launched its official website &quot;hkej.com&quot; which contains the daily newspaper content, instant news, real time stock quotes and different kinds of financial data and information.

In February 2011, HKEJ launched its English website, &quot;EJ Insight&quot;.

In July 2016 the paper suspended the column of Joseph Lian Yi-zheng (). Lian, a former member of the Central Policy Unit as well as the former editor-in-chief of HKEJ, had recently written pieces sympathetic to the localist movement, leading to allegations that his dismissal was motivated by self-censorship. A group of current and former HKEJ staff penned a letter demanding that editor-in-chief Alice Kwok Yim-ming revoke and explain the decision.

===Ownership===
It was reported that, as early as 10 January 2006, the Lam&#x27;s family was in negotiation with Richard Li (head of Hong Kong–based telecommunication giant PCCW) and another local mass-media company for the sale of the newspaper.

On 9 August 2006, Clemont Media Limited, in which Li is the settler of the trust, bought a 50% stake in the newspaper. In August 2014, Clermont Media Limited acquired the remaining shares from Shun Po Company Limited and wholly owned the company.

==Sections==
The &quot;Journal&quot; pages are categorised into &quot;News&quot;, &quot;Investment&quot;, &quot;Technology&quot;, &quot;Editorials&quot; and &quot;Supplement&quot;.

==Related publications==
===&quot;EJ Insight&quot;===
&quot;EJ Insight&quot; is the online English language news website of the &quot;Hong Kong Economic Journal&quot;. It was launched in February 2011. The content comprises a mix of original English reporting and pieces translated from the Chinese language HKEJ.

===&quot;Hong Kong Economic Journal Monthly&quot;===

The &quot;Hong Kong Economic Journal Monthly&quot; () is a monthly magazine associated with the newspaper. First published in March 1977, this magazine also belongs to Hong Kong Economic Journal Co., Ltd. Its contents are mainly about Hong Kong, mainland China, and international economics and finance. Different from the newspaper, the magazine is sold around the world, including Hong Kong, mainland China, Macau, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Japan, Europe, Australia, and the United States. The current chief editor of the magazine is Vincent Teng Chuen-cheong ().

<text>Shalom Meir Tower (, &quot;Migdal Shalom Meir&quot;; commonly known as Migdal Shalom, ) is an office tower in Tel Aviv, Israel. It was the first skyscraper built in Israel.

==Overview==
Shalom Meir Tower was designed by architects Yitzhak Pearlstein, Gideon Ziv, and Meir Levy. Migdal Shalom has 34 floors and stands at a height of .

50,000 cubic meters of concrete, 4,000 tons of steel, 35 km of water pipes, and 500 km of wiring were used in the tower.

When its construction was completed in 1965, it was the tallest building in the Middle East, as well as the tallest in Asia, and rivaled the tallest buildings in Europe in height. It was the last building in Western Asia to be the tallest building in Asia until the Burj Khalifa in Dubai was completed in 2010.

==History==
The tower was built on the site of the Herzliya Hebrew High School, better known as Herzliya Gymnasium. The school&#x27;s architecturally and historically significant structure was razed and the school relocated in order to build the tower in 1962. This decision was later regretted and the contour of the Herzliya Gymnasium became the emblem of the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites in Israel, which was founded partially as a response to the building&#x27;s fate.

Construction was carried out by the Meir Brothers, Moshe, Mordechai and Menachem Meir, who named it after their father, Reb Shalom-Shachna Meir, born in Sanok in Galicia. Shalom-Shachna Meir married the daughter of a rich manufacturer from the Romanian region of Moldova, where he lived until 1920, becoming a successful businessman as well as a leader of the local Zionists. In 1920 he emigrated to Palestine where he became an important public figure in the early years of Tel Aviv, a member of the town&#x27;s first city council, and one of the founders of Ramat Gan.

The building has a cream hue tile facade which was created especially for the tower and was manufactured in Italy. A subway station was built under the tower block, but rails were never laid and the station remains empty and disconnected from any rail system.

==Artwork and exhibits==
The ground-floor retail promenade features a mosaic mural by the Israeli artist Nachum Gutman facing another one by David Sharir. The Shalom Tower now houses the Tel Aviv Center comprising a number of permanent and temporary exhibitions dedicated to the beginnings and development of Tel Aviv.

<doc id="346169" wikidata="Q1355832" url="?curid=346169" title="Supreme Court of New Zealand">
<text>The Supreme Court of New Zealand () is the highest court and the court of last resort of New Zealand. It formally came into being on 1 January 2004 and sat for the first time on 1 July 2004. It replaced the right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, based in London. It was created with the passing of the Supreme Court Act 2003, on 15 October 2003. At the time, the creation of the Supreme Court and the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council were controversial constitutional changes in New Zealand. The Supreme Court Act 2003 was repealed on 1 March 2017 and superseded by the Senior Courts Act 2016.

The current Supreme Court should not be confused with the High Court of New Zealand, which was known as the Supreme Court until 1980. The High Court, New Zealand’s superior court, was established in 1841 as the “Supreme Court of New Zealand”. Its name was changed in anticipation of the eventual creation of this final court of appeal within New Zealand.

==Composition==

The inaugural bench (with the exception of the chief justice, who had automatic appointment) were the most senior judges of the New Zealand Court of Appeal at the time. Their appointment to the new court was said to have been based on seniority and merit. The maximum bench under statute is six judges.

Several acting judges have also been appointed to sit whenever a permanent judge was unable to do so due to illness or a conflict of interest. These judges were appointed from the retired judges of the Court of Appeal and have included Justices Sir John Henry, Sir Ted Thomas, former President of the Court of Appeal Sir Ivor Richardson and former Chief Justice Sir Thomas Eichelbaum. Acting judges only sit on substantive appeals, and not applications for leave, due to the requirement for appeals to be heard en banc by five judges.

On 4 May 2005, Attorney-General Michael Cullen announced the appointment of Justice Sir John McGrath of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court bench as its sixth permanent judge. On 21 February 2006, the Honourable Sir Noel Anderson (at the time President of the Court of Appeal) was appointed to the Supreme Court. Thus the promotion of the most senior Court of Appeal member continued. This practice was broken with the appointment of Justice Bill Wilson in December 2007 after having served less than a year as a judge of the Court of Appeal.

===Eligibility to be a justice of the Supreme Court===

Under section 94 of the Senior Courts Act 2016 an existing judge can only be appointed a Supreme Court justice if already a member of the Court of Appeal or the High Court. If the person is not a member of either of those courts, the candidate must be appointed as a High Court judge at the same time as taking office in the Supreme Court.

==Creation==

While the suggestion of ending appeals to the Privy Council had been around since the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947, proposals to end appeals to the Privy Council began in the late 1970s, when a Royal Commission on the judiciary canvassed arguments for replacing the Privy Council. In the early 1980s, Minister of Justice Jim McLay suggested their abolition. Proposals for an indigenous final appellate court can be traced back to 1985. In 1996, Attorney-General Paul East proposed to end the status of the Privy Council as the country&#x27;s highest court of appeal. The proposal got as far as a bill being introduced into Parliament. However, this bill met with little support from within the National Party, and the bill was not carried over by the next Parliament following the 1996 general election.

The policy was resurrected in 1999 by the Fifth Labour Government. A discussion paper, &quot;Reshaping New Zealand&#x27;s Appeal Structure&quot; attracted 70 submissions. A year later a Ministerial Action Group was formed to assist Ministers in designing the purpose, structure and make-up of a final court of appeal. The Group&#x27;s report, &quot;Replacing the Privy Council: A New Supreme Court&quot; was published in April 2002, before the general election a few months later.

On 9 December 2002, after the Labour government&#x27;s re-election at the 2002 general election, Attorney-General Margaret Wilson introduced the Supreme Court Bill to create the Supreme Court and abolish appeals to the Privy Council. A Campaign for the Privy Council was established to lobby against the abolition of appeals. Many business and community groups joined the opposition to the ending of appeals. The Monarchist League of New Zealand opposed the abolition of appeals, stating:
Margaret Wilson argued in favour of the bill, stating:


=== Select committee ===

At select committee, the bill attracted numerous submissions for and against creating the Supreme Court. Notable supporters of the Supreme Court were former President of the Court of Appeal, Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, and Privy Councillor Lord Cooke of Thorndon and former Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Palmer, while most senior lawyers were opposed to the change. The Monarchist League complained the majority of members of the select committee were motivated by a &quot;republican agenda&quot;.

Opposition parties had called unsuccessfully for a national referendum on the creation of the Supreme Court. While the bill was before the select committee, Auckland lawyer Dennis J Gates launched a petition for a non-binding citizens initiated referendum on 3 April 2003, asking the question &quot;Should all rights of appeal to the Privy Council be abolished?&quot;. The petition failed to gain the 310,000 signatures of registered electors needed and lapsed on 2 July 2004.

=== Third reading ===

The Supreme Court Bill passed its third reading 63 to 53. The governing Labour and Progressive parties, supported by the Greens, voted in favour, while the National, New Zealand First, ACT New Zealand, and United Future parties voted against. It received Royal Assent on 17 October 2003, with commencement on 1 January 2004.

=== Later changes ===

In 2008, National leader John Key (then the leader of the opposition) ruled out any abolition of the Supreme Court and return to the Privy Council. The Key Government eventually repealed the Supreme Court Act 2003 and replaced it with the Senior Courts Act 2016, as part of a modernisation of judicature legislation. The reform was supported by National, Labour, the Greens, the Māori Party, ACT and United Future, and was opposed by New Zealand First.

===Appointments===

One issue that was particularly contentious as the bill was being debated in Parliament was the appointment of judges to the court, with opposition parties claiming that the Attorney-General would make partisan choices. These concerns were because the entire bench was to be appointed simultaneously, and no clear statement had been made about how they would be selected. However, the level of concern was considerably lessened when Wilson announced that the appointments would be based on merit and seniority. Appointments to the court were expected and unsurprising. The most senior justices on the Court of Appeal were appointed to the new court.

==Cases==

One of the grounds advanced for the creation of the court was that it would allow more people to have access to the country&#x27;s highest appellate court. From 1851 until 2002, the Privy Council made 268 decisions relating to New Zealand. In the ten years from 1992–2002, only 21 decisions had been allowed with respect to New Zealand. The Supreme Court hears many more cases than were heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council due to its jurisdiction being considerably broader. For example, cases in the areas of employment, criminal and family law can be heard by the Supreme Court, whereas previously cases in both areas of law could normally progress no further than the Court of Appeal. The proximity of the court is another factor that is likely to contribute to it hearing an increased number of appeals and also allows appeals to be heard and determined considerably faster than under the former system.

The court has heard many applications for leave. It has also heard many substantive appeals. Notable substantive cases include:
*&quot;Morgan v Superintendent of Rimutaka Prison&quot; [2005] 3 NZLR 1 (retrospective penalties).
*&quot;Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd&quot; [2005] NZSC 34 (determination of employee or contractor status).
*&quot;Zaoui v Attorney-General (No 2)&quot; [2006] 1 NZLR 289 (human rights of refugees in relation to national security).
*&quot;R v L&quot; [2006] 3 NZLR 291 (mens rea of attempted sexual violation).
*&quot;Brooker v Police&quot; [2007] NZSC 30 (test for disorderly behaviour under section 4(1)(a) of the Summary Offences Act 1981.)
*&quot;Lai v Chamberlains&quot; [2007] 2 NZLR 7 (immunity of barristers from suit).
*&quot;Taunoa v Attorney-General&quot; [2008] 1 NZLR 429 (remedies for Bill of Rights breach).
*&quot;R v Hansen&quot; [2007] 3 NZLR 1 (burden of proof and evidential burden under Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 in relation to Bill of Rights).
*&quot;Mahomed v R&quot; [2011] NZSC 52 (admissibility of propensity evidence in criminal prosecutions).
*&quot;Hamed &amp; Ors. v R&quot; [2011] NZSC 101 (admissibility of video surveillance obtained during criminal trespass).
*&quot;Taueki v R&quot; [2013] NZSC 146 (meaning of the phrase &quot;in peaceable possession&quot; as it relates to the Crimes Act 1961),
*&quot;Environmental Defence Society v New Zealand King Salmon&quot; [2014] NZSC 38 (interpretation of the Resource Management Act).
*&quot;Paki v Attorney-General (No 2)&quot; [2014] NZSC 118 (&quot;usque ad medium filum aquae&quot; only applies where consistent with Maori custom)
*&quot;Booth v R&quot; [2016] NZSC 127, [2017] 1 NZLR 223 (determination of correct calculation for prisoner release dates)
*&quot;New Health New Zealand Incorporated v South Taranaki District Council&quot; [2018] NZSC 59, [2018] NZSC 60 (legality of water fluoridation)
*&quot;Peter Hugh McGregor Ellis v The King&quot; [2022] NZSC 114 (overturning of Ellis&#x27; conviction)
*&quot;Make It 16 Incorporated v Attorney-General&quot; [2022] NZSC 134 (the minimum voting age of 18 years is inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990)

==Building==

The Supreme Court sits in Wellington. Until the court&#x27;s new $80.7 million home was built—beside and expanding into the historic High Court building—the court was housed in temporary facilities located in the High Court in Wellington with offices located in Old Government Buildings. The building was formally opened on 18 January 2010 by Prince William.

The upper portion of the building&#x27;s exterior is surrounded by a bronze screen and red glass facade. The forms were inspired by the intertwining of rātā and pōhutukawa trees. The interior follows a similar theme; the court room is oval shaped with tiled walls mimicking the shape of a kauri cone.

==Leave==
Unlike final appellate courts in some other countries, there is no automatic right of appeal to the Supreme Court of New Zealand. All appeals are by leave granted by the Supreme Court. No lower courts may grant leave to appeal. Leave is granted or declined based on a number of factors listed in section 74 of the Senior Courts Act, with the overarching principle being that it must be necessary in the interests of justice for the court to hear the appeal. Leave applications may be determined by any two permanent judges of the court based on the written submission of the parties without an oral hearing; however, they are normally determined by a panel of three. The judges determining the application can decide to hold an oral hearing if they wish.

This system is also in place in the United Kingdom where the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the highest court of appeal in the United Kingdom, also must grant leave for appeal for cases to be heard before it. The same is true for appeals to the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong. Similarly, most litigants seeking to appeal to the Constitutional Court of South Africa, Supreme Court of the United States, Supreme Court of Canada or High Court of Australia require leave before their case can be heard – although there are some exceptions to this in the latter three courts.

== Comparison to the Privy Council and criticism ==

Since its foundation, the Supreme Court has been subject to &quot;unprecedented public criticism&quot;. The quality of several Supreme Court judgments have been criticised in New Zealand and overseas, and concerns expressed about the impact on the country&#x27;s case law and international reputation. The major criticisms are the Supreme Court&#x27;s lack of experience and its membership being drawn initially from the Court of Appeal. Defenders of the court argue that it has provided easier access to the courts. They also note that the argument that the court would not be independent has been disproved by the Supreme Court&#x27;s willingness to overrule decisions of the Court of Appeal.

Prior to discontinuation the Privy Council heard up to 12 cases from New Zealand a year. From its creation through May 2012, the Supreme Court heard an average of 29 substantive appeals annually.

<text>Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is the public broadcasting service of Hong Kong. GOW, the predecessor to RTHK, was established in 1928 as the first broadcasting service in Hong Kong. As a government department under the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau of the Hong Kong Government that directly supported by annual government funding, RTHK&#x27;s educational, entertainment, and public affairs programmes are broadcast on its eight radio channels and five television channels, as well as commercial television channels.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated RTHK to be &quot;State Controlled Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

==History==
The British Hong Kong Government launched its first radio broadcasting station, known as &quot;GOW&quot;, on 20 June 1928, with a starting staff of only six people. Several name changes occurred over the next few years, and it eventually became known as &quot;Radio Hong Kong&quot; (RHK) () in 1948.

In 1949, broadcasting operations were taken over by the Government Information Services (GIS), but by 1954, RHK had managed to establish itself as an independent department. Up until 1966, the radio station was only on-air for three periods during the day; at morning, lunchtime, and evening. This was partly due to many of the presenters being part-time freelancers who had to fit their radio appearances in with their normal daily working schedule.

In 1969, the station&#x27;s medium wave AM transmitting station was moved from a waterfront site in Hung Hom to the summit of Golden Hill in the New Territories. Although the new transmitters were much more powerful, the mountain-top site proved unsuitable for medium wave transmissions and reception in some areas has remained problematic ever since. In March 1969, RHK moved its headquarters to new purpose-built studios located at Broadcasting House () in Kowloon Tong.

A Public Affairs Television Unit was established in 1970 to produce TV programmes for required broadcast by independent channels. At that time, RHK did not have its own television broadcast transmitters.

In 1973, RHK set up its own radio newsroom. Prior to this, all news had been prepared by Government Information Services staff. Until 1969, headlines were sent to the studios every half-hour by teleprinter from the GIS headquarters in Central District, while the three daily full bulletins were hand-delivered by a messenger. This arrangement became impractical following the move to the new studios in 1969, so initially a GIS newsroom was set up in Broadcasting House. This arrangement also proved unsatisfactory and RHK&#x27;s own journalists, who until then had been confined to producing magazine programmes, took over the entire news operation.

In 1976, the station&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Radio Television Hong Kong&quot; (RTHK) to reflect its new involvement in television programme production. In the same year, it began to produce educational television programmes for schools after absorbing the previously independent Educational Television Unit.

In 1986, RTHK headquarters moved across the road to the former Commercial Television studios, which were renamed Television House. The station&#x27;s first news and financial news channel, Radio 7, was established in November 1989.

In December 1994, RTHK launched its website and made its television productions, as well as content from its seven radio channels, available online. The website provided live broadcasts as well as a twelve-month archive (with the exception of HKCEE and HKALE broadcasts in RTHK2 due to copyright issues with the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority). The website, presented in English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese, initially offered free news via email three times per day, as well as online content.

In 2013, RTHK trialled and launched a new television channel. To support this new television operation, the government administration increased the station&#x27;s funding by between HK$300 million and HK$400 million a year.

In April 2016, RTHK took over the analogue channel frequencies of Asia Television (ATV) after the latter&#x27;s free television licence expired.

In March 2017, as the Hong Kong government decided to terminate DAB services in Hong Kong, RTHK said that it would integrate the existing DAB programmes into existing AM and FM radio channels. As the government claimed that RTHK would stop DAB service within six months, meaning DAB service would be terminated no later than 30 September 2017.

With the termination of DAB+ in Hong Kong, RTHK announced in August 2017 that the broadcaster&#x27;s relay of BBC World Service on Radio 6 would be reduced to 8 hours a day and move to an overnight slot on Radio 4; Radio 6 would instead relay China National Radio&#x27;s programme 14 which targets Hong Kong. CNR&#x27;s programme 14 was previously heard on RTHK DAB 2 until DAB services in Hong Kong were shut down.

Since 2020, RTHK programmes are no longer broadcast on TVB channels. In February 2021 it announced it would cease entirely relaying BBC World Service radio broadcasts following Chinese government criticism of the BBC. Leung Ka-wing, Director of Broadcasting, said it was his decision to follow Beijing&#x27;s lead in shutting off BBC, and that &quot;Hong Kong is part of China and Radio Television Hong Kong is a department of the HKSAR Government. The decision has nothing to do with news operations.&quot;

=== 2021 management change ===
Following complaints from pro-Beijing politicians and groups for alleged bias against the police and the government, the government initiated a review of operations at the broadcaster. In February 2021, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau issued a report on RTHK&#x27;s governance and management at a press briefing in which the broadcaster was criticised as having &quot;weak editorial accountability&quot;. It was further alleged in the report that there were no clear records of its decision-making process on controversial and sensitive matters, while complaints handling was said to lack &quot;sufficient transparency.&quot; The government announced the Director of Broadcasting Leung Ka-wing would leave his post six months prior to the expiry of his contract, and that he would be replaced by incumbent Deputy Secretary for Home Affairs Patrick Li – a career civil servant without experience in broadcasting.

In August 2021, RTHK partnered with the mainland China Media Group, in a move that RTHK said was intended to strengthen &quot;patriotism&quot; in its programs.

Eddie Cheung took over as head of RTHK in October 2022. In November 2022, he said that &quot;RTHK and other government departments, including the police, should cooperate seamlessly to serve citizens.&quot;

==Radio==

=== Stations ===
RTHK operates eight radio stations:

===Radio programmes===

* RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards

==Television==

=== Channels ===
RTHK operates five television channels:

The analogue television channels (TV31A and TV33A) ceased broadcasting on 30 November 2020.

A channel that dedicated to live coverage of 2024 Summer Olympics and the 2024 Summer Paralympics, RTHK TV 36, started test transmission on 24 June 2024 and began relaying sports programmes on 2 July. The channel was officially launched in time for the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. After the Olympics and Paralympics were ended, RTHK TV 36 ceased broadcasting on 1 November 2024.

=== Television programmes ===

==== Public affairs ====
RTHK primarily produces public affairs programmes such as &quot;Hong Kong Connection&quot; (), &quot;Headliner&quot; (), &quot;A Week in Politics&quot; (), &quot;Media Watch&quot; (), &quot;Pentaprism&quot; (), &quot;Access&quot; (), &quot;The Pulse&quot; and &quot;Police Report&quot; (). These are also broadcast by Hong Kong&#x27;s three commercial television channels, TVB, ViuTV and HKIBC, in addition to RTHK&#x27;s own television network. The government has lifted the requirement since March 2020, therefore TVB no longer broadcasts them.

==== Dramas ====
It has also produced TV dramas, including the classic &quot;Below the Lion Rock&quot; ().

====ETV====
RTHK and the Hong Kong Education Bureau jointly produce Educational Television (ETV, ), a series of educational programmes for primary and secondary students – airing during non-peak hours on RTHK stations. ETV was first broadcast in 1971 for Primary 3 students and was extended to Primary 6 students in 1974. In 1978, it was extended to cover junior secondary (Form 1-Form 3) students. RTHK formerly broadcast these programmes on their stations during non-peak daytime hours.

While school programmes covering the topics of English, Chinese, Mathematics and Mandarin Chinese are provided to both primary and secondary students, Science and Humanities programmes are provided for secondary school students only and General Studies programmes are designed for primary students only.

There has been confusion between ETV and the ETV division of RTHK. Besides school ETV programmes, the ETV division of RTHK produces public educational television programmes for general viewers, such as &quot;Road Back&quot; (), &quot;Anti-Drug Special&quot; (), &quot;Sex Education&quot; (), and &quot;Doctor and You&quot; ().

The nature documentary &quot;Biodiversity in Hong Kong&quot; (大自然大不同) follows the style of BBC Planet Earth but is narrated in Cantonese. It showcases the ecosystem and biodiversity of Hong Kong.

The high production cost of school ETV programmes was criticised by the Audit Commission. In 2017–18, the production cost of school ETV programmes was a staggering HK$1.58 million per hour.

== Awards ==
RTHK has received multiple awards for its reporting on the 2019 Hong Kong protests, such as from the 50th US International Film and Video Festival, the 2020 New York TV and Film Awards, and the 24th Human Rights Press Awards.

RTHK won an award for an episode of &quot;Hong Kong Connection&quot; about the 2019 Yuen Long attack, but declined the award and said it would not accept any awards during its &quot;transition period&quot; under its new director.

==Controversies==

===Misconduct===
In 2002, a former Chief Programme Officer was convicted of misconduct in public office. The charges related to approving salary increases for one RTHK employee without complying with procedures.

On 8 June 2006, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) of Hong Kong arrested four people on corruption-related charges, including a deputy head of RTHK 2 and a disc jockey, who were arrested for committing scams totalling about HK$70,000 from 1995 to 2001. They were alleged to have conspired and sold scripts for various programmes that they did not write. Another former disc jockey and her mother were alleged to have aided the conspiracy by using their bank accounts by receiving payments from the radio station. All four were arrested and were released on bail.

RTHK was also criticised by the Audit Commission of the Hong Kong Government for its problems on complying with regulations on staff management. The report especially highlighted the misuse of public funds by the RTHK staff on entertainment expenses, overtime claims and the outsourcing of services.

In July 2007, the head of RTHK and Director of Broadcasting was accidentally spotted by a group of journalists in Causeway Bay along with an unidentified female. The journalists were actually waiting for singer Kenny Bee, who was in a nearby restaurant. On seeing the gathered journalists, Chu ducked behind his companion. Photos became the main page headlines in some of the major Hong Kong newspapers the following day. Chu, who was one year due to his official retirement from the government, subsequently decided to seek early retirement in the aftermath.

=== Nabela Qoser probation controversy ===
Nabela Qoser, who became known to the public after she sharply and unremittingly questioned Hong Kong officials at press conferences following the 2019 Yuen Long attack, saw her three-year-long probation as a civil servant extended by 120 days following a management decision to reopen the investigations on her performance. She stood to be dismissed if she rejected the extension. Members of the RTHK Program Staff Union called the decision &quot;unjustified suppression&quot; and &quot;baseless act derailing from established staff management regulations&quot;. Coconuts Media reported that pro-Beijing groups had vilified Qoser, calling her disrespectful and directing racial slurs at her. Qoser left the broadcaster at the end of May 2021.

=== Censorship under Patrick Li ===
Following the appointment of Patrick Li to the post of Director of Broadcasting on 1 March 2021, ten television episodes have been censored; YouTube content more than one-year-old have been removed from RTHK&#x27;s channel. RTHK claimed that it was to align the YouTube channel with RTHK&#x27;s policy of only making content available for one year since the date of broadcast on their own website. This move triggered a May 2021 online campaign among RTHK viewers to archive the channel on their own. In early August 2021, the broadcaster deleted its English-language Twitter archive, and announced on 5 August that it was disabling comments for all future tweets due to &quot;resource constraints&quot; that did not allow it to combat any misinformation contained in comments.

In March 2021, it was reported that three executives had left the company within two weeks, two of whom left because they did not want to sign an oath declaring loyalty to the government. In March, Li said that he would review all programmes before they could be broadcast.

Within a month since Li took over, at least nine episodes of various programmes, including two episodes of &quot;Hong Kong Connection&quot; – known for its investigative reporting, have been axed. Days before the 32nd anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, RTHK journalists were informed that no political story would be allowed to air. Programming cut back or cancelled at least 10 programmes – including an segment about the Tiananmen anniversary already aired the week before. RTHK management said three episodes of &quot;Hong Kong Connection&quot;, &quot;Hong Kong Stories&quot;, and &quot;LegCo Review&quot; &quot;were not impartial, unbiased and accurate&quot;.

On 29 June 2021, RTHK let go of veteran Allan Au Ka-lun, ending 11 years of him hosting the Open Line Open View program.

On 5 July, Reporters Without Borders published a report on world leaders who had &quot;cracked down massively on press freedoms&quot;. As one reason for including Chief Executive Carrie Lam in the list, the report cited what it described as launching a &quot;full-blown intimidation campaign&quot; against RTHK, and said that Li had been &quot;tasked with setting up an internal censorship system&quot; at the broadcaster.

=== Taiwan ===
Legislative Council member Luk Chung-hung in July 2021 asked Edward Yau, Commerce Secretary, if RTHK&#x27;s use of the word &quot;president&quot; when referring to Tsai Ing-wen breached the one-China principle. A week later, RTHK implemented new rules, which banned the use of words which would describe Taiwan (and the Republic of China) as an independent country in all television, radio, and online broadcasts.

=== Tiananmen Square ===
In June 2023, several days before the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, RTHK removed a letter of gratitude from its office, which thanked its reporters for covering the event and was displayed in the office for 34 years.

<doc id="346183" wikidata="Q1350656" url="?curid=346183" title="Corn whiskey">
<text>Corn whiskey is an American liquor made principally from corn. Distinct from the stereotypical American moonshine, in which sugar is normally added to the mash, corn whiskey uses a traditional mash process, and is subject to the tax and identity laws for alcohol under federal law.

==Legal requirements==
Corn whiskey is made from a mash of at least 80 percent corn and distilled to a maximum strength of 160 proof (80% alcohol by volume).

Unlike other American whiskey styles, corn whiskey is not required to be aged in wood. If aged, it must be in either uncharred or previously used oak barrels and must be barreled at lower than 125 proof (62.5% abv). In contrast, a whiskey distilled from a mash consisting of at least 80% corn in a charred new oak barrel would be considered bourbon. Aging is usually brief – six months or less – during which time the whiskey absorbs color and flavor from the barrel while the off-flavors and fusel alcohols are reduced. A variant called straight corn whiskey is also produced, in which the whiskey is stored in used or uncharred new oak containers for two years or more. Whiskeys produced in this manner and aged for at least four years can be designated bottled in bond if they meet additional requirements.

==Availability==
Many American whiskey distillers include unaged corn whiskeys in their product lines along with bourbons and other styles. A few large whiskey producers make unaged corn whiskeys but most corn whiskeys are made by smaller distillers located all around the country.

<doc id="346185" wikidata="Q877050" url="?curid=346185" title="Optical disc image">
<text>An optical disc image (or ISO image, from the ISO 9660 file system used with CD-ROM media) is a disk image that contains everything that would be written to an optical disc, disk sector by disc sector, including the optical disc file system. ISO images contain the binary image of an optical media file system (usually ISO 9660 and its extensions or UDF), including the data in its files in binary format, copied exactly as they were stored on the disc. The data inside the ISO image will be structured according to the file system that was used on the optical disc from which it was created.

ISO images can be created from optical discs by disk imaging software, or from a collection of files by optical disc authoring software, or from a different disk image file by means of conversion. Software distributed on bootable discs is often available for download in ISO image format; like any other ISO image, it may be written to an optical disc such as CD, DVD and Blu-Ray.

== Description ==

Optical-disc images are uncompressed and do not use a particular container format; they are a sector-by-sector copy of the data on an optical disc, stored inside a binary file. Other than ISO 9660 media, an ISO image might also contain a UDF (ISO/IEC 13346) file system (commonly used by DVDs and Blu-ray Discs), including the data in its files in binary format, copied exactly as they were stored on the disc. The data inside the ISO image will be structured according to the file system that was used on the optical disc from which it was created.

The &quot;.iso&quot; file extension is the one most commonly used for this type of disc images. The &quot;.img&quot; extension can also be found on some ISO image files, such as in some images from Microsoft DreamSpark; however, IMG files, which also use the &quot;.img&quot; extension, tend to have slightly different contents. The &quot;.udf&quot; file extension is sometimes used to indicate that the file system inside the ISO image is actually UDF and not ISO 9660.

ISO files store only the user data from each sector on an optical disc, ignoring the control headers and error correction data, and are therefore slightly smaller than a raw disc image of optical media. Since the size of the user-data portion of a sector (logical sector) in data optical discs is 2,048 bytes, the size of an ISO image will be a multiple of 2,048.

Any single-track CD-ROM, DVD or Blu-ray disc can be archived in ISO format as a true digital copy of the original. Unlike a physical optical disc, an image can be transferred over any data link or removable storage medium. An ISO image can be opened with almost every multi-format file archiver. Native support for handling ISO images varies from operating system to operating system.

With a suitable driver software, an ISO can be &quot;mounted&quot; – allowing the operating system to interface with it, just as if the ISO were a physical optical disc. Most Unix-based operating systems, including Linux and macOS, have this built-in capability to mount an ISO. Versions of Windows, beginning with Windows 8, also have such a capability. For other operating systems, separately available software drivers can be installed to achieve the same objective.

== Multiple-track images ==

A CD can have multiple tracks, which can contain computer data, audio, or video. File systems such as ISO 9660 are stored inside one of these tracks. Since ISO images are expected to contain a binary copy of the file system and its contents, there is no concept of a &quot;track&quot; inside an ISO image, since a track is a container for the contents of an ISO image. This means that CDs with multiple tracks can not be stored inside a single ISO image; at most, an ISO image will contain the data inside one of those multiple tracks, and only if it is stored inside a standard file system.

This also means that audio CDs, which are usually composed of multiple tracks, can not be stored inside an ISO image. Furthermore, not even a single track of an audio CD can be stored as an ISO image, since audio tracks do not contain a file system inside them, but only a continuous stream of encoded audio data. This audio is stored on sectors of 2352 bytes different from those that store a file system and it is not stored inside files; it is addressed with &quot;track numbers&quot;, &quot;index points&quot; and a &quot;CD time code&quot; that are encoded into the lead-in of each session of the CD-Audio disc.

Video CDs and Super Video CDs require at least two tracks on a CD, so it is also not possible to store an image of one of these discs inside an ISO image file, however an .IMG file can achieve this.

Formats such as CUE/BIN, CCD/IMG and MDS/MDF formats can be used to store multi-track disc images, including audio CDs. These formats store a raw disc image of the complete disc, including information from all tracks, along with a companion file describing the multiple tracks and the characteristics of each of those tracks. This would allow an optical media burning tool to have all the information required to correctly burn the image on a new disc. For audio CDs, one can also transfer the audio data into uncompressed audio files like WAV or AIFF, optionally reserving the metadata (see CD ripping).

Most software that is capable of writing from ISO images to hard disks or recordable media (CD / DVD / BD) is generally not able to write from ISO disk images to flash drives. This limitation is more related to the availability of software tools able to perform this task, than to problems in the format itself. However, since 2011, various software has existed to write raw image files to USB flash drives.

== Uses ==

.ISO files are commonly used in emulators to replicate a CD image. Emulators such as Dolphin and PCSX2 use .iso files to emulate Wii and GameCube games, and PlayStation 2 games, respectively. They can also be used as virtual CD-ROMs for hypervisors such as VMware Workstation or VirtualBox. Other uses are burning disk images of operating systems to physical install media.

<doc id="346186" wikidata="Q1187121" url="?curid=346186" title="Denglisch">
<text>Denglisch () is a term describing the increased use of anglicisms and pseudo-anglicisms in the German language. It is a portmanteau of the German words (&quot;German&quot;) and . The term is first recorded from 1965.

The word has been adopted in English in an anglicized form as Denglish, recorded from 1996.

== Terminology ==
The term is particularly used by language purists in all German-speaking countries to refer to the increasingly strong influx of English or pseudo-English vocabulary (and other features of the language such as grammar and orthography) into German. The standard German reference work &quot;Duden&quot; defines it as &quot;a pejorative term for German with too many English expressions mixed in.&quot;

Other sources use words with aggressive, hostile, or negative connotations to describe it such as &quot;a persistent infiltration&quot;, an &quot;invasion&quot;, &quot;onslaught&quot;, or &quot;attack&quot;, or that it is &quot;corrupting the language&quot; or is an &quot;infectious disease&quot;.

The term itself is not a standard German word, but an informal portmanteau of &quot;Deutsch&quot; + &quot;English&quot;, and gives the same kind of impression in German, as the word &quot;Spanglish&quot; has in English: i.e., it is well-understood, but it is an informal word for which there is no common equivalent in standard language use.

Other slang terms in German which refer to the same phenomenon include: (&quot;McGerman&quot;), (&quot;dumb German&quot;), (kebab German).

In English there are numerous colloquial portmanteau words. One set is based on the word &quot;Deutsch&quot;. These include (chronologically) &quot;Deutschlisch&quot; (first recorded in 1970), &quot;Deutlish&quot; (1977), &quot;Deutschlish&quot; (1979) and &quot;Dinglish&quot; (1990). Another set of terms is based on the word &quot;German&quot;. These include (chronologically) &quot;Germenglish&quot; (first recorded 1936), &quot;Germanglish&quot; (1967), &quot;Gerglish&quot; (1968), &quot;Germish&quot; (1972), &quot;Germlish&quot; (1974), &quot;Genglish&quot; (1977), &quot;Ginglish&quot; (1989), &quot;Germinglish&quot; (1996), and &quot;Gernglish&quot; (1996).

== Criticism ==
Some influence of English on German is expected as part of normal language contact. The term &quot;Denglisch&quot; refers to abundant or excessive use of anglicisms or pseudo-anglicisms in German.

The introduction of English buzzwords peaked during the 1990s and the early 2000s. Since then, the ubiquity of the practice has made it much less fashionable or prestigious, and several commentators have argued against it. &quot;Zeit Online&quot; (whose title is itself an example of the prevalence of anglicisms in German IT terminology) criticized the ubiquitous use of English in a 2007 article. Although the article acknowledged the risks of excessive linguistic purism, it condemned the fashion of labeling information desks at train stations, formerly simply known as &quot;Auskunft&quot;, with the anglicism &quot;Service Point&quot;. The choice of the pseudo-anglicism &quot;Brain up!&quot; by then-minister for education Edelgard Bulmahn as a campaign slogan in 2004 was highlighted as an extreme case by &quot;Die Zeit&quot;. &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine&quot; satirized this choice at the time of its introduction, and later wrote that even the English-speaking sphere was mocking &quot;German linguistic submissiveness&quot;.

== Forms of influence ==
Words and expressions labeled as Denglisch can come from various sources, including loanwords, calques, anglicisms, pseudo-anglicisms, or adoption of non-native grammar, syntax, or spelling.

=== Loanwords ===

German vocabulary has numerous cases of English loanwords now fully &quot;naturalized&quot; as German words, including full inflection. English had only very limited influence on German before the mid-19th century. Such loanwords as there are mostly concern nautical vocabulary, loaned into Low German (e.g. &quot;tank&quot;, ultimately from Indo-Aryan; &quot;Tanker&quot; (&quot;tanker (ship)&quot;) is early 20th century).

In the 19th century, it was still more common to use loan translation for the vocabulary of industrialisation (&quot;Dampfmaschine&quot; for &quot;steam engine&quot;, &quot;Pferdestärke&quot; for &quot;horse power&quot;, etc.). To some extent, this continued in the early 20th century: &quot;Wolkenkratzer&quot; for &quot;skyscraper&quot;, &quot;Kaugummi&quot; for &quot;chewing gum&quot;, &quot;Flutlicht&quot; for &quot;flood light&quot;, &quot;Fernsehen&quot; for &quot;television&quot;.

English loanwords became more common in the early 20th century. A notable example from this period is &quot;Test&quot; (ultimately from Old French &quot;test&quot; &quot;earthen pot&quot;). &quot;Test&quot; was compatible both with German phonology and orthography so its nature as a loan is not evident.

Early loanwords (19th to early 20th century) often describe garments or foodstuffs: &quot;Jumper&quot; (19th century), &quot;Curry&quot; (19th century loan from English, ultimately from Tamil), &quot;Pyjama&quot; (early 20th century loan from English &quot;pyjamas&quot;, ultimately from Urdu), &quot;Trenchcoat&quot; (1920s). Other loanwords are &quot;boykottieren&quot; &quot;to boycott&quot; (1890s) and &quot;Star&quot;.

Direct influence of English, especially via US pop culture, became far more pronounced after the end of World War II, with allied-occupied Germany and later by association with 1960s to 1970s US counterculture: &quot;Jeep&quot;, &quot;Quiz&quot;, &quot;Show&quot;, &quot;Western&quot;, &quot;Rock&quot;, &quot;Hippie&quot;, &quot;Groupie&quot;.

The newest and most prolific wave of anglicisms arose after 1989 with the end of the Cold War and the surge of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; smack of economic liberalism in continental Europe and the associated business jargon (&quot;CEO&quot; became extremely fashionable in German, replacing traditional terms such as &quot;Direktor&quot;, &quot;Geschäftsführer&quot;, &quot;Vorsitzender&quot; during the 1990s). At the same time, the rapid development of information technology pushed many technical terms from that field into everyday language.

Many of the more recent loans have developed in the spoken language and are still clearly felt to be English words, so their English orthography is retained in written communication, which leads to awkward spellings combining German morphemes with English word stems, as in ge&quot;boot&quot;et (&quot;booted up&quot; of a computer) or &quot;gecrasht&quot; or &quot;gecrashed&quot; (&quot;crashed&quot;, of a computer), &quot;downgeloadet&quot;, &quot;gedownloadet&quot; or &quot;gedownloaded&quot; (&quot;downloaded&quot;). They also retain English phonology in many cases, including phonemes that do not exist in Standard German (such as the /eɪ/ in &quot;upd&quot;a&quot;te&quot;).

=== Pseudo-anglicisms ===
A pseudo-anglicism is a word in another language that is formed from English elements and may appear to be English, but is not used by native English speakers.

=== Adoption of grammar or idioms ===
Another form of Denglisch consists of calques of popular English expressions which replace German words and idioms. Common examples are:

*&quot;Was passierte in 2005?&quot; (What happened in 2005?) Formally: &quot;Was passierte 2005?&quot; or &quot;Was passierte im Jahr 2005?&quot;

Although this is considered incorrect by many native speakers as it violates German grammar, it can be found even in German newspapers.

*&quot;Das macht Sinn.&quot; (That makes sense.) Formally: &quot;Das ergibt Sinn.&quot;; &quot;Das hat Sinn.&quot;, or &quot;Das ist sinnvoll&quot;.
*&quot;Willkommen zu [unserem Videochannel]&quot;, properly &quot;Willkommen bei ...&quot; (although it has been pointed out that combination of &quot;willkommen&quot; with the preposition &quot;zu&quot; can also be found in German classics).

=== Orthography ===
Another phenomenon is the usage of the possessive construction &quot; &#x27;s &quot; (generally used in English but also correct in German in sundry cases), often called &quot;Deppenapostroph&quot; or &quot;Idiotenapostroph&quot; (&quot;Idiot&#x27;s apostrophe&quot; or &quot;Idiot&#x27;s inverted comma&quot;) instead of the traditional German constructions. For example, a Denglisch speaker might write &quot;Wikipedia&#x27;s Gestaltung&quot; (&quot;Wikipedia&#x27;s design&quot;) instead of either &quot;Wikipedias Gestaltung&quot; or &quot;die Gestaltung der Wikipedia&quot;. Less often, it is used incorrectly to mark a plural s (Greengrocers&#x27; apostrophe); pluralizing with an apostrophe is correct in Dutch, not in German or English.
: &quot;Handy&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Dessou&#x27;s&quot;,
or for adverbial expressions, such as
: &quot;montag&#x27;s&quot; (instead of &quot;montags&quot;, cf. English [on] Mondays).

The apostrophe is also frequently confused with other characters, with stand-alone acute or grave accents being used in its stead.

Denglisch may combine words according to English rules by writing them in succession. According to the Standard German grammar and spelling rules, that is incorrect.
: &quot;Reparatur Annahme&quot; instead of &quot;Reparaturannahme&quot;
The first spelling, with two separate words, makes no logical or grammatical connection between the words but simply juxtaposes them. The second combines them into one word, an &quot;Annahme&quot; (in this case a place where something is received) for &quot;Reparaturen&quot; (repairs). That is often called &quot;Deppenleerstelle&quot;, or &quot;Deppenleerzeichen&quot; which means &quot;idiot&#x27;s space&quot;, incorrectly separating parts of a compound word.

=== Non-translation ===
Many words are taken over as is from English, with little or no change in spelling even if it doesn&#x27;t fit the German orthographic system. One German source laments the presence of Denglisch as an &quot;infectious disease&quot; of &quot;raging anglicitis&quot; in the German language, which manifests as a kind of &quot;hybrid communications medium&quot;. It gives as examples the words &quot;events&quot;, &quot;economy&quot;, &quot;performance&quot;, &quot;entertainment&quot;, or &quot;electronic cash&quot; appearing in German.

Some major companies such as Deutsche Bank now conduct much of their business in English, while several departments of the major German telephone company Deutsche Telekom were known as &quot;T-Home&quot; (formerly &quot;T-Com&quot;), &quot;T-Mobile&quot;, &quot;T-Online&quot;, and &quot;T-Systems&quot;.

Reinventing titles for English-language films dubbed into German was once a common practice so, for example, Paul Landres&#x27;s 1958 Western &quot;Man from God&#x27;s Country&quot; became &quot;Männer, die in Stiefeln sterben&quot; (i.e. &quot;Men Who Die with Their Boots On.&quot;), while Raoul Walsh&#x27;s 1941 film 
&quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; became &quot;Sein letztes Kommando&quot; (&quot;His Last Command&quot;) or &quot;Der Held des Westens&quot; (&quot;The Hero of the West&quot;). Most current American film titles are no longer translated into German, (&quot;Ice Age&quot;) although they still often receive German appendages like &quot;Prometheus – Dunkle Zeichen&quot; (&quot;Prometheus – Dark Signs&quot;) or include puns not present in the original title, such as &quot;Clerks – Die Ladenhüter&quot; for &quot;Clerks – The Shelf-Warmers&quot;. Menus of many global fast food chains also usually go partly or completely untranslated: &quot;Double Whopper (formally: &quot;Doppel-Whopper&quot;) mit leckerem Bacon und Cheddar Cheese.&quot;

=== Advertising language ===
Advertising agencies in German-speaking countries have such a need for skills in English that they want ads for new employees to contain plain English such as &quot;Join us&quot;. KFC Germany&#x27;s recruitment slogan is &quot;I Am for Real&quot;, and its website shows very heavy use of English coupled with nonstandard German.

German commercials or, more often, written advertisements are likely to use many English terms:
:&quot;

The verb &quot;downloaden&quot; is alleged to have been coined by Microsoft, as there is a native, common German word (&quot;). Microsoft Windows Update uses the phrase &quot; (&quot;Download the latest updates&quot;) instead of the standard &quot;. The latest interface guidelines suggest that the term &quot; should be used again because many users complained. However, &quot;Aktualisierungen&quot; (unlike &quot;herunterladen&quot;) would not be idiomatic German in this usage or would at least have to be explained as &quot;Softwareaktualisierungen&quot; or &quot;Programmaktualisierungen&quot;, the former involving the new Anglicism &quot;Software&quot;.

The use of (&quot;) has its roots in a commercial name, too. It is related to the handheld Walkie-talkie, a commercial name for the two-way radio transceiver to be transported in a bag, later in hands and so called (&quot;). A correct translation could be (&quot;). Germans used to cite the word (&quot;) as an example of Denglisch.

Advertising in the field of personal hygiene tends to use much English:

:&quot;Double Action Waschgel&quot;
:&quot;Vitalisierendes Peeling&quot;
:&quot;Energy Creme Q10&quot;
:&quot;Oil Control Gel Creme&quot;
:&quot;Oil Control Waschgel&quot;
:[brand name] &quot;Visibly Clear Anti-Mitesser Peeling&quot;
:&quot;Ariel Sproodles&quot;

The same applies to detergents:

:&quot;Color Waschmittel&quot; instead of &quot;Buntwaschmittel&quot; or &quot;Farbwaschmittel&quot;
:[brand name] &quot;Megaperls&quot;
:[brand name] &quot;Oxy-Action&quot;

Larger national and international companies based in Germany also use English to describe their services. The television broadcaster ProSieben uses the slogan &quot;We love to entertain you&quot; while Zurich Financial Services advertise with the slogan &quot;Because change happens&quot;. The fastest trains run by the German state-owned railway system Deutsche Bahn (German Rail) are named &quot;IC&quot; and &quot;ICE&quot;, abbreviations of &quot;Inter City&quot; and &quot;Inter City Express&quot;, while information booths are named &quot;ServicePoints&quot;, first-class waiting areas are referred to as &quot;Lounges&quot;, and words like &quot;Kundendienst&quot; (customer service) and &quot;Fahrkarte&quot; (ticket) are quickly losing out to their respective English counterparts. As an official stance against this rampant use of Denglisch, the Deutsche Bahn in June 2013 issued a directive and glossary of 2200 Anglicisms that should be replaced by their German counterparts.

Sometimes such neologisms also use CamelCase, as in the Deutsche Telekom&#x27;s newest rates called &quot;Fulltime&quot;, &quot;Freetime&quot;, &quot;Call Plus&quot; and &quot;Call Time&quot; offering additionally such features as &quot;CountrySelect&quot;. They do not even refrain from offering services at certain &#x27;Callshops&#x27;, using both languages by building a German-style compound, capitalizing it and using two English words in a new context. It has become common for travel agencies to offer &quot;last minute&quot; bookings or manufacturers to adopt &quot;just in time&quot;; perhaps driven by international commerce and economic interests.

The phrase &quot;Test it&quot; is increasingly common as an English phrase idiosyncratic to German, meaning roughly &quot;Try it out&quot;. That is thought to have originated with advertising copy for West cigarettes, exhorting consumers to &quot;Test The West&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
* The popular German &quot;a cappella&quot; group Wise Guys produced a song on their &quot;Radio&quot; album called &quot;Denglisch&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek look at the use of English words in German language. In the song, the lyrics start out mostly German with only a few English words creeping in: &quot;Oh, Herr, bitte gib mir meine Sprache zurück!&quot; (&quot;O Lord, please give me my language back!&quot;). It progresses to most of the lyrics being English: &quot;O Lord, please gib mir meine Language back&quot;. The tune is a parody of &quot;My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean&quot;.
* In 1985, the famous German poetic songwriter Reinhard Mey recorded &quot;Mey English Song&quot; as a parody on the increasingly frequent playing of English songs on the radio, although the fans &quot;only understand &#x27;railway station&#x27;&quot; (literal translation of the German idiom &quot;verstehe nur Bahnhof&quot;; &quot;cannot understand a thing&quot;). In the song, he states, his producer told him, &quot;Well, what do we now for record sell?&quot;, urging Mey to sing in English.
* In an episode of the web series &quot;Will It Blend?&quot; Tom puts a German-English/English-German CD dictionary into his blender. After he finishes blending the dictionary, he says, &quot;Denglish smoke! Don&#x27;t breathe this!&quot;
* The book &quot;I like you – und du?&quot; () features frequent code-switching between English and German.
* The songs of Austrian singer Falco, while primarily sung in German, would often include lines or choruses sung in English. This casual mixing of languages became a signature of the artist.
* The punk rock band Goldfinger from Los Angeles produced a cover of &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; by Nena for their 2000 album &quot;Stomping Ground&quot; in which the fourth verse is in German. They also included a &quot;Germish version&quot; of their song Spokesman as a bonus track on their 2002 album &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, containing a mostly German second verse.
* The American Civil War song &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Fight Mit Sigel&quot; is sung in English, interspersed with German words, from the point of view of a German-American soldier fighting under General Franz Sigel.
* The Austrian composer and singer Udo Jürgens produced a song &quot;Merry Christmas allerseits&quot; (&quot;Merry Christmas to All&quot;) for his 2003 album &quot;Es werde Licht - meine Winter- + Weihnachtslieder&quot; (&quot;Let There be Light - My Winter and Christmas Songs&quot;), containing a mixture of English and German lyrics.

<text>The common grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia) is a species of Old World warbler in the grass warbler genus &quot;Locustella&quot;. It breeds across much of temperate Europe and the western Palearctic. It is migratory, wintering in north and west Africa.

This small passerine bird is found in short dense vegetation, often close to water. It is a medium-sized warbler about long. The adult has a streaked brown back and whitish grey underparts which are unstreaked except on the undertail coverts. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous. Four to seven eggs are laid in a nest on or near the ground in thick vegetation or in a tussock of grass.

This is a species which skulks in the undergrowth, creeping through bushes and low foliage, and which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing from a prominent position. The song, which gives this species its name, is a monotonous mechanical insect-like reeling, often given at dawn or dusk.

==Taxonomy==
The Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi included the common grasshopper warbler in the second volume of his &quot;Ornithologiae&quot;. Aldrovandi died in 1605 but the volume was not published until 1637. In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a detailed description of the common grasshopper warbler in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot;. He used the French name &quot;La fauvette tachetée&quot; and the Latin name &quot;Curruca naevia&quot; but although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.

The common grasshopper warbler was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1779 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla naevia&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;; he used the word &quot;naevia&quot; that had earlier been used by Brisson. 
The type locality is Bologna in Italy. The common grasshopper warbler is now one of 20 species placed in the genus &quot;Locustella&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829 with the common grasshopper warbler as the type species. The genus name &quot;Locustella&quot; is from Latin and is a diminutive of &quot;locusta&quot;, &quot;grasshopper&quot;. The specific &quot;naevia&quot; is Latin for &quot;spotted &quot;.

Four subspecies are recognised.
* &quot;L. n. naevia&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – Europe to west European Russia and Ukraine; wintering in West Africa
* &quot;L. n. straminea&quot; Seebohm, 1881 – east European Russia to southwest, south central Siberia, east Kazakhstan, west Mongolia and northwest China; wintering in south Asia
* &quot;L. n. obscurior&quot; Buturlin, 1929 – east Turkey and the Caucasus
* &quot;L. n. mongolica&quot; – Kazakhstan to Afghanistan and west Mongolia; winters to north India

==Description==
The adult common grasshopper warbler (the name is the IOC recommended English name) has a length of about . It is a very secretive bird and seldom seen, but its presence is easily detected because of its characteristic song. The upper-parts are pale olive-brown, each feather having a central darker brown streak. The cheeks are greyish, the irises are brown and there is a faint eye streak behind the eye. The upper mandible of the beak is dark brown and the lower mandible yellowish-brown. The underparts are cream-coloured or yellowish-buff with a few dark brown spots and streaks on the breast and flanks. The wings are brown with the outer edge of the feathers rimmed with paler brown. The tail feathers are reddish-brown with faint transverse bars being visible in some individuals and the under-tail coverts are streaked. The slender legs and the feet are pale yellowish-brown.
The song is an unmusical long, high-pitched reeling trill performed with beak held wide open and the whole body vibrating. It lasts for from a few seconds to two or three minutes with hardly a pause for breath. It varies in volume from a faint hum to a sound resembling a distant mowing machine. It is performed at any time of day from early morning until after the sun has set and is constantly to be heard from the arrival of the bird in spring until late July. The alarm call is a repeated ticking noise that has been rendered as &quot;twkit-twkit-twkit&quot;. The song is similar to that of its congeners: the lanceolated warbler (&quot;Locustella lanceolata&quot;), Savi&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Locustella luscinioides&quot;) and the river warbler (&quot;Locustella fluviatilis&quot;).

==Distribution and habitat==
The common grasshopper warbler breeds in northwest Europe and the western Palearctic. The range includes Spain, France, central Italy, Romania, Yugoslavia, the British Isles, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, southern Sweden, southern Finland, the Baltic States and western parts of Russia. Further east it is replaced by related species. In late summer, it migrates to northwest Africa, India and Sri Lanka where it overwinters.

In the breeding season, the common grasshopper warbler is found in damp or dry places with rough grass and bushes such as the edges of fens, clearings, neglected hedgerows, heaths, upland moors, gorse-covered areas, young plantations and felled woodland. In the winter, it is usually found in similar locations but information is scarce on its behaviour and habitat at this time.

==Behaviour==

This bird seldom takes to the wing but spends its time scurrying through dense vegetation, flitting from twig to twig or running along the ground. It has a peculiar high-stepping gait and long stride as it moves along horizontal stems, looking slender and tapering. It seldom flies, soon diving back into cover, and when it alights it often raises and flares its tail to show its streaked under-tail coverts. It has been known to feign injury in order to distract a potential predator.

===Breeding===

Male common grasshopper warblers try to attract females by displaying to them. They walk or run along twigs with tail spread, fluttering their wings as they raise and lower them, often carrying a grass or leaf in their beak. In the air, with wings well extended and fluttering, they spread their tail and fluff their feathers.

Both sexes take part in nest-building. The nest is well-concealed and built close to the ground in such places as grass tussocks, gorse bushes, osier beds, reed beds, tangled hedgerows, scrub and among coarse heather plants on moorland. It varies in size and shape but is constructed of grasses, sedges and mosses and often lined with fine grasses. A clutch of four to six eggs is laid. These are creamy white speckled with fine reddish spots, usually randomly distributed but sometimes merged into blotches or zones. The eggs measure and weigh about . Both parents are involved in incubating the eggs which takes about fourteen days. The chicks are altricial and are fed on insects. They fledge in twelve to thirteen days and there are usually two broods in the season. Young birds become mature at a year old and the highest recorded age for this species is five years.

===Food and feeding===
The common grasshopper warbler is insectivorous, feeding on a wide range of invertebrates. Its diet includes flies, moths, beetles, aphids, dragonflies and mayflies and their larvae. Spiders and woodlice are also eaten and the chicks are fed on aphids, green caterpillars, woodlice and flies.

==Status==
The common grasshopper warbler is assessed by the IUCN in their Red List of Threatened Species as being of Least Concern. This is because it has a large total population and an extensive range. The population in Europe is estimated to be between 840,000 and 2.2 million breeding pairs with a total of 2.5 to 6.6 million individuals. As Europe amounts to about two thirds of its total range, the world population is estimated to be in the region of 3.4 to 13.2 million individuals. The total number of birds may be on the decline because of habitat loss, but not to an extent that would warrant listing the bird under a higher risk category. In a study examining the possible effects of global warming on the range of various species of bird, it was estimated that the breeding range of the common grasshopper warbler would be displaced several hundred miles northwards and would cover the British Isles and the whole of Scandinavia but that it would cease to breed in much of its present range in mainland Europe.

<doc id="346194" wikidata="Q1088701" url="?curid=346194" title="Tennessee whiskey">
<text>Tennessee whiskey is straight whiskey produced in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Although it has been legally defined as a bourbon whiskey in some international trade agreements, most current producers of Tennessee whiskey disclaim references to their products as &quot;bourbon&quot; and do not label them as such on any of their bottles or advertising materials. All current Tennessee whiskey producers are required by Tennessee law to produce their whiskeys in Tennessee and – with the sole exception of Benjamin Prichard&#x27;s – to use a filtering step known as the Lincoln County Process prior to aging the whiskey. Beyond the perceived marketing value of the distinction, Tennessee whiskey and bourbon have almost identical requirements, and most Tennessee whiskeys meet the criteria for bourbon.

Tennessee whiskey is one of the top ten exports of Tennessee. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, as of 2013, the U.S. market for bourbon and Tennessee whiskey reached $2.4 billion, and exports of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey grew to exceed $1 billion. There are two major producers of Tennessee whiskey, Jack Daniel&#x27;s based in Lynchburg (owned by the Louisville, Kentucky-based Brown-Forman) and George Dickel based in Cascade Hollow near Tullahoma (owned by the London-based Diageo), as well as numerous locally based producers throughout the state. In June 2017, the Tennessee Distillers Guild launched the Tennessee Whiskey Trail, a 25-stop distillery tour across the state, to further promote Tennessee whiskey and local whiskey culture. 

==History==
Whiskey production in Tennessee started with the emigration of Scotch-Irish from Pennsylvania and Virginia. President Andrew Jackson served Tennessee whiskey in the White House, a custom continued by James Polk. Filtering of whiskey through maple charcoal was practiced as early as 1825 by Alfred Eaton in Tullahoma, though the process was likely used earlier outside of Tennessee. Jack Daniel&#x27;s was established as a brand in 1875. By the end of the 19th century, there were over 700 licensed distilleries in the state.

Statewide prohibition on the sale and manufacture of alcohol took effect in 1910, wiping out the industry. Following repeal in 1933, Jack Daniel&#x27;s moved operations back to Lynchburg (the company&#x27;s attempts at production in Missouri and Alabama did not yield any saleable product) as the first distillery to open post-Prohibition. The next distillery to be licensed in the state, George Dickel, followed in 1958 as a revived brand.

===Robertson County===
Robertson County, which in the 19th century distilled more whiskey than any other county in the state, produced a &quot;distinctive&quot; sour mash whiskey that was said to be &quot;similar to, but not quite the same as, Kentucky bourbon.&quot; The Prohibition amendment destroyed the few remaining Robertson County distilleries that survived into the 20th century.

==Lincoln County Process==

Nearly all Tennessee whiskeys undergo a filtering stage called the Lincoln County Process, in which the whiskey is filtered through (or steeped in) a thick layer of maple charcoal before it is put into new charred oak barrels for aging. The companies that produce whiskey in this manner suggest this step improves the flavor of the whiskey. The filtering process is named for Lincoln County, Tennessee, the home of the Jack Daniel&#x27;s distillery when it originally began operations. However, in 1871, the boundaries of the county changed, placing the Jack Daniel&#x27;s distillery and the surrounding area in the newly created Moore County. Ironically, the only whiskey currently produced within the current boundaries of Lincoln County is Prichard&#x27;s, which is the only Tennessee whiskey that does &quot;not&quot; use the Lincoln County Process.

==Legal status==
On a federal level, the definition of Tennessee whiskey is legally established under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and at least one other international trade agreement that require it to be &quot;a straight Bourbon whiskey authorized to be produced only in the State of Tennessee&quot;. Canadian food and drug laws state that Tennessee whiskey must be &quot;a straight Bourbon whisky produced in the State of Tennessee&quot;.

On a state level, the State of Tennessee has imposed stringent requirements for Tennessee whiskey. It is not enough under state law that the whiskey be produced in Tennessee; it must also meet specific quality and production standards. On May 13, 2013, Tennessee governor Bill Haslam signed House Bill 1084, requiring the Lincoln County process (which involves maple charcoal filtering) to be used for products produced in the state labeled as &quot;Tennessee Whiskey&quot;, along with the existing requirements for bourbon (e.g., mash consisting of at least 51% corn, aging in new charred oak barrels, and limits on alcohol by volume concentration for distillation, aging, and bottling). The law contains a specific exception for Benjamin Prichard&#x27;s, which does not use the Lincoln County process. As federal law requires statements of origin on labels to be accurate, the Tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to Tennessee whiskey.

Although Jack Daniel&#x27;s supported the 2013 legislation – stating it was necessary to bring the quality of Tennessee whiskey to the level of bourbons and Scotches – some of the state&#x27;s smaller distilleries opposed it, arguing the process required by the law was too close to the process used by Jack Daniel&#x27;s. Phil Prichard, the owner and distiller of Benjamin Prichard&#x27;s, said, &quot;If I wanted my whiskey to taste like Jack Daniel&#x27;s, I would make it like Jack Daniel&#x27;s.&quot; Jeff Arnett, the Master Distiller at Jack Daniel&#x27;s, noted that stringent requirements were required by Scotch makers in Scotland and champagne makers in France, and Tennessee whiskey should not be treated any differently.

In 2014, legislation was introduced in the Tennessee state legislature to amend the 2013 law to allow the reuse of barrels in the aging process. Diageo, which owns George Dickel, supported the proposed change. Arnett blasted the proposed amendment, going as far as to accuse Diageo of attempting to weaken the quality of Tennessee whiskey to protect its Scotch and bourbon brands. Diageo argued that the 2013 law was an attempt by Jack Daniel&#x27;s to push smaller competitors out of the market.

Relatively few original brands of Tennessee whiskey exist today, due to statewide prohibition that lasted even longer than national prohibition. As of 2013, many Tennessee counties still prohibit the sale of alcohol. In 2009, the Tennessee General Assembly amended the statute that had for many years limited the distillation of drinkable spirits to just three of Tennessee&#x27;s 95 counties (Lincoln, Moore, and Coffee). The revised law allows distilleries to be established in 41 additional counties. This change is expected to lead to the establishment of more small distilleries, thus increasing the number of producers of Tennessee whiskey.

==Brands==

===Current producers===
* Benjamin Prichard&#x27;s from Kelso
* Chattanooga Whiskey Company from Chattanooga
* Collier and McKeel from Nashville
* Farrar Distillery from Noah
* George Dickel (a Diageo brand) from Tullahoma
* Jack Daniel&#x27;s (a Brown-Forman brand) from Lynchburg
* Nelson&#x27;s Green Brier Distillery from Nashville 
* Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey, Shelbyville, Tennessee

==Whiskey made in Tennessee that is not &quot;Tennessee whiskey&quot;==
All Tennessee whiskey is from Tennessee, but not all whiskey from Tennessee is &quot;Tennessee whiskey&quot;. For example, the Ole Smoky Distillery (which began operation in 2010) is located in Tennessee and produces several whiskey products, but they are not sold as Tennessee whiskey because they do not meet all the criteria necessary for such. Instead, they are usually marketed under other terms, such as &quot;Tennessee moonshine&quot;, “bourbon whiskey”, or simply “whiskey”.

Chattanooga Whiskey&#x27;s Tennessee High Malt style of whiskey making generally meet all of the Bourbon requirements for Tennessee Whiskey, however its products do not undergo the Lincoln County filtration process.

George Dickel began production of a rye whiskey in 2012 that also cannot be labeled a Tennessee whiskey because it is produced from a rye-based mash and is not distilled in Tennessee. Most of the stages of its production are conducted under contract in Indiana, and the whiskey is then trucked to the Diageo bottling plant in Plainfield, Illinois, for filtering with charcoal made at the Dickel distillery and then bottling. In early 2014, the brand introduced a white corn whiskey using an unaged version of its standard mashbill, which consists of more than 80% corn, allowing for its sale as &quot;corn whiskey&quot;. The bottle makes no reference to Tennessee whiskey. Dickel would go on to release a Bourbon whiskey.

Production began in 2012 of a Jack Daniel&#x27;s Tennessee Rye. As it is 70% rye, it is not labeled as a Tennessee whiskey. A limited initial release that was not aged in wood was labeled &quot;Spirits Distilled from Grain&quot;. A second limited release, called &quot;Rested Rye&quot;, was released after two years of aging and labeled a straight rye whiskey. A fully aged version was released in 2017.

As of 2017, Benjamin Prichard&#x27;s also produces a Tennessee Rye Whiskey, a malt whiskey, two whiskeys labeled as bourbon, and an unaged corn whiskey called Lincoln County Lightning. Like Prichard&#x27;s Tennessee whiskey, these are not charcoal filtered prior to aging.

As of 2014, Popcorn Sutton&#x27;s Tennessee White Whiskey was an unaged corn whiskey produced in Tennessee.

==In popular culture==
Tennessee whiskey is the namesake for the country music song &quot;Tennessee Whiskey&quot;, written by Dean Dillon and Linda Hargrove and originally released by David Allan Coe as the of his 1981 studio LP. The song was later recorded and released as a hit single by George Jones in 1983. More recently, the song was covered by Chris Stapleton in 2015 on his album &quot;Traveller&quot;.

<text>The Element of Crime () is a 1984 Danish experimental neo-noir crime film co-written and directed by Lars von Trier. It is the first feature film directed by von Trier and the first installment of the director&#x27;s Europa trilogy — succeeded by &quot;Epidemic&quot; (1987) and &quot;Europa&quot; (1991).

==Plot==
A detective named Fisher, who has become an expatriate living in Cairo, undergoes hypnosis in order to recall his last case. The Europe of his dreamlike recollection is a dystopia, dark and decaying continent. Fisher remembers that he was hired by the police chief Kramer to pursue a serial killer called the &quot;Lotto Murderer&quot;, who was strangling and then mutilating young girls who were selling lottery tickets. He attempts to track down the killer using the controversial methods outlined in a book entitled &quot;The Element of Crime&quot;, written by his disgraced mentor, Osborne. Fisher&#x27;s search is based on a tailing report written by Osborne when trying to track down a murderer Harry Grey, who had been killing in the same way as the &quot;Lotto Murderer&quot;, but who, supposedly, has since died in a crash. He is joined in his search by a prostitute named Kim, who, it turns out, has had a child by Harry Grey. The Osborne method requires the detective to try to identify with the mind of the killer. This he does, but, in so doing, begins to behave more and more like a serial killer himself. The film suggests that both Osborne and Fisher, by going too deeply into a serial killer&#x27;s mind, have become murderers themselves. Osborne, we are told, confessed his crime or multiple murders to Police Chief Kramer before committing suicide. Fisher apparently goes back to Cairo as the case is closed. The film ends with Fisher, still under hypnosis, seemingly going into his subconsciousness and discovering an imprisoned little animal there. He then tells the hypnotist &quot;You can wake me up now&quot; but receives no response.

==Style==
The film employs the film noir conventions of monochrome footage, apparently constant night, and the frequent presence of water, such as rain and rivers. The film is shot almost entirely in sodium light, resulting in images reminiscent of sepia tone, though with a more intense yellow. Because sodium lamps produce light in only a few narrow emission peaks, rather than over a wide spectrum, the film has an almost monochrome appearance. The sepia is occasionally contrasted with piercing blues and reds.

The world depicted in the film is semi-derelict. Disordered collections of similar or identical objects are found in many of the scenes, reinforcing the sense of a crumbling society. Examples include white paper, light bulbs, heaps of keys, surgical scissors, glass bottles, rubber stamps, and Coca-Cola cans.

The film&#x27;s slow pace, dark visuals and occasional surreal imagery give it a dreamlike quality. In addition, much of the dialogue is contradictory. An example is one conversation between Fisher and his mentor&#x27;s housekeeper:
:Fisher: Is it always as dark as this at this time of the year?
:Housekeeper: There are no seasons anymore. The last three summers haven&#x27;t been summers. The weather changes all the time. It never alters.

In the opening of the film, a shot of a donkey lying on its back and then slowly struggling to stand may be a homage to a similar shot in Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s &quot;Andrei Rublev&quot; (1966). von Trier has stated that he is an admirer of Tarkovsky&#x27;s work:

I was very inspired by Tarkovsky. I won&#x27;t make any bones about that. I saw an excerpt from &quot;The Mirror&quot; (&quot;Zerkalo&quot;) on Swedish television once, just a travelling shot around that house, and that was one of those &#x27;I&#x27;ll be damned&#x27; experiences.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Element of Crime&quot; polarized critics at Cannes in 1984. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 80% of critics gave the film a positive review.

Peter Cowie, in 2000, writes that &quot;&quot;The&quot; &quot;Element&quot; &quot;of&quot; &quot;Crime&quot; heralded a new voice in film... No film made by Lars von Trier is quite so mesmeric as this debut... this expressionist ritual could have been made by Murnau, Lang, Pabst or any of the masters of German silent cinema&quot; and concludes &quot;&quot;The&quot; &quot;Element&quot; &quot;of&quot; &quot;Crime&quot; undoubtedly proclaimed a talent as unusual and compelling as any to emerge from Northern Europe since World War II.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film received several awards including the Bodil Awards and Robert Awards in 1985 for the Best Film. It received Technical Grand Prize and was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival.

==Home media==
&quot;The Element of Crime&quot; has been released on DVD in North America by the Criterion Collection. In 2023, Criterion released a 3K restoration of the film as part of the Blu-ray box set, &quot;Lars von Trier&#x27;s Europe Trilogy&quot;. In Europe, a digitally remastered DVD is available as part of the box set &quot;Lars von Trier&#x27;s Europe Trilogy – Hypnotic Edition&quot;.

<doc id="346200" wikidata="Q44453" url="?curid=346200" title="Kurt Angle">
<text>Kurt Steven Angle (born December 9, 1968) is an American retired professional wrestler, amateur wrestler and podcaster. He first earned recognition for winning a gold medal in freestyle wrestling at the 1996 Summer Olympics despite competing with a broken neck, and achieved wider fame for his tenures in WWE and TNA. He is considered one of the greatest professional and amateur wrestlers of all time.

Angle won numerous accolades while at Clarion University of Pennsylvania, including being a two-time NCAA Division I Wrestling Champion in the Heavyweight division. After graduating, he won gold medals in freestyle wrestling at the 1995 World Wrestling Championships and 1996 Summer Olympics. He is one of four people to win the Junior Nationals, NCAA, World Championships, and the Olympics. In 2006, he was named by USA Wrestling as the greatest shoot wrestler of all time and as one of USA Wrestling&#x27;s top 15 college wrestlers of all time. In 2016, he was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame.

Angle made his first appearance at a professional wrestling event in 1996, and signed with the WWF (now WWE) in 1998. Although he was never a fan of professional wrestling and previously had a negative opinion of it due to its scripted nature, he was noted for his natural aptitude for it; after training for only a few days, he had his debut match within the WWF&#x27;s developmental system in August 1998 and had his first official WWF match in March 1999. After months of dark matches, Angle made his televised in-ring debut in November 1999. Within two months, he was holding the European and Intercontinental Championships simultaneously. Four months later, he won the 2000 King of the Ring tournament and began pursuing the WWF Championship, which he won in October and would go on to win a total of four times. He also became a one-time WCW Champion and one-time World Heavyweight Champion. He is the tenth professional wrestler to achieve the WWE Triple Crown and the fifth to achieve the WWE Grand Slam. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame&#x27;s class of 2017.

After leaving WWE in 2006, Angle joined TNA, where he became a record six-time TNA World Heavyweight Champion and the second TNA Triple Crown winner, holding all three TNA championships simultaneously. He is also a two-time King of the Mountain. During his tenure with TNA, he also competed for NJPW and the IGF, winning the IWGP Heavyweight Championship once. In 2013, he was inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame. He is the second wrestler, after Sting, to be inducted into both the WWE and TNA Halls of Fame.

Angle has won over 21 professional wrestling championships and is an overall 13-time world champion. He is the only wrestler to have won the WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship, WCW Championship, TNA World Heavyweight Championship, IWGP Heavyweight Championship, and an NCAA Wrestling Championship. He is also the first person to hold both the WWE and TNA Triple Crowns. He has headlined numerous pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania XIX and Bound for Glory on three occasions, the flagship events of WWE and TNA respectively. In 2004, the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; inducted Angle into its Hall of Fame and later named him &quot;Wrestler of the Decade&quot; for the 2000s. John Cena called Angle &quot;without question the most gifted all-around performer we have ever had step into a ring&quot; and said &quot;there will never be another like him&quot;.

== Early life ==
Kurt Steven Angle was born in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, on December 9, 1968, the son of Jackie and David Angle. He is of Welsh, German, Irish, Polish and Lithuanian descent. He has four older brothers named David, Mark, John, and Eric, the latter of whom is also a wrestler; his older sister, Le&#x27;Anne, died at the age of 43 in 2003. He attended Clarion University of Pennsylvania, graduating with a degree in education in 1993. His father was a crane operator who died in a construction accident while working on Fifth Avenue Place when Angle was 16. Angle dedicated both his career and his autobiography to his father. He stated in an interview that, following his father&#x27;s death, he regarded his wrestling coach David Schultz as a paternal figure. While training Angle, Schultz was murdered in January 1996 by John Eleuthère du Pont, the sponsor of Schultz&#x27;s team of Olympic prospectives. Angle&#x27;s mother died of cancer in 2015.

== Amateur wrestling career ==
Kurt Angle started amateur wrestling at the age of seven. He attended Mt. Lebanon High School, where he won varsity letters in football, as an All-State linebacker, and wrestling. He was undefeated on the freshman wrestling team and qualified for the state wrestling tournament his sophomore year. Angle also placed third in the state wrestling tournament as a junior and was the 1987 Pennsylvania State Wrestling Champion as a senior.

Upon graduating from high school, Angle attended Clarion University of Pennsylvania, where he continued to wrestle at the amateur level. He was a two-time National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I champion, national runner-up in 1991, and a three-time NCAA Division I All-American. In addition, Angle was the 1987 USA Junior Freestyle champion, a two-time USA Senior Freestyle champion, and the 1988 USA International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles Junior World Freestyle champion.

After graduating from college, Angle continued to wrestle. In 1995, he won a gold medal at the FILA Wrestling World Championships in Atlanta, Georgia. Following this victory, Angle began preparing for the 1996 Summer Olympics (also in Atlanta) under Dave Schultz at the Pennsylvanian Foxcatcher Club, training between eight and ten hours a day. In January 1996, not long after Angle began training at the club, Schultz was murdered by John Eleuthère du Pont, the sponsor of Schultz&#x27;s team of Olympic prospectives. As a result, Angle quit du Pont&#x27;s team, searched for new sponsors, and joined the Dave Schultz Wrestling Club in Schultz&#x27;s memory.

Angle faced further hardships while taking part in the 1996 Olympic Trials, when he suffered a severe neck injury, fracturing two of his cervical vertebrae, herniating two discs, and pulling four muscles. Nonetheless, Angle won the trials and then spent the subsequent five months resting and rehabilitating. By the Olympics, Angle was able to compete, albeit with several pain-reducing injections in his neck. In the fall of 1996, Angle stated that he temporarily became addicted to the analgesic Vicodin after injuring his neck. He won his gold medal in the heavyweight (90–100 kg; 198–220 lb) weight class despite his injury, defeating several competitors including Mongolian Dolgorsürengiin Sumyaabazar, Cuban Wilfredo Morales, Ukrainian Sagid Murtazaliev, and others. Angle won four close matches to earn his spot in the gold-medal finals.

In 2006, Angle was named the greatest shoot wrestler of all time by USA Wrestling, as well as one of the top 15 college wrestlers. In April 2011, Angle revealed that he was planning a comeback to amateur wrestling for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He later announced he was unable to make the trials for the national team due to a knee injury, though he held an honorary title as team manager. In 2016, Angle was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame for his amateur wrestling accomplishments.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996) ===
On October 26, 1996, Angle was convinced by fellow Pittsburgh native Shane Douglas to attend the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) event High Incident. He gave an in-ring interview and provided guest commentary during a match between Taz and Little Guido, but left the building after Raven attached Sandman to a cross using barbed wire. Angle, shocked by the controversial imagery and afraid that his career prospects were going to be damaged if he was associated with the incident, threatened to sue ECW owner Paul Heyman if he was shown on television in the same broadcast as the stunt.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1998–2006) ===
==== Developmental and main roster debut (1998–2000) ====
Despite achieving success in amateur wrestling, Angle initially held professional wrestling in low regard. He rejected a decade-long contract with the WWF due to his unwillingness to accept scripted losses. His opinion of professional wrestling changed when he began watching &quot;WWE Raw&quot; in 1998 and developed an admiration for Stone Cold Steve Austin&#x27;s talents as an entertainer. He later conceded that his negative attitude toward the industry was misguided and &quot;stupid&quot;.

In 1998, Angle had a tryout with the WWF after the rescindment of the WWF&#x27;s original 1996 offer. He was subsequently signed to a five-year deal in August 1998, just three days after his tryout. Angle trained under Dory Funk Jr. at the Funkin&#x27; Dojo training camp in Stamford, Connecticut. Within a week, he started wrestling in front of a live audience. His debut match occurred in the WWF&#x27;s then-developmental territory WWA on August 20, where he faced his trainer Tom Prichard.

Angle continued to wrestle for the WWA in August and September. Additionally, he sought bookings outside of the WWF, participating in a battle royal won by Steve Williams at the National Wrestling Alliance&#x27;s (NWA) 50th Anniversary Show on October 24. Angle also performed for Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling (PCW) defeating Steve Bradley and the East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA) in February 1999 defeating Cyborg.

In March, Angle began wrestling regularly for the WWF&#x27;s Power Pro Wrestling (PPW) developmental league in Memphis, Tennessee. He appeared on WWF television on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, where he took part in an angle with Tiger Ali Singh. He won over Brian Christopher on April 11. In the following months, Angle wrestled on house shows and in other dark matches, in preparation for his televised debut. He faced against Owen Hart in a dark match on Shotgun Saturday Night just two weeks before Owen died. He also continued to wrestle for PPW through October and on July 24 won the PPW Championship. Angle then lost the championship to Steve Bradley on August 7. He is noted for learning the art of pro wrestling quicker than almost anyone else; WWE executive and former opponent Triple H described Angle as &quot;probably the fastest guy I&#x27;ve ever seen pick this business up&quot;, owing to &quot;phenomenal&quot; athleticism and an &quot;aptitude&quot; for the industry.

After several weeks of vignettes, Angle made his televised WWF in-ring debut on November 14 at Survivor Series at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan, defeating Shawn Stasiak. In his initial push, he remained undefeated for several weeks, eventually losing to the debuting Tazz at the Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000. Angle won both the European Championship on the February 10 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and the Intercontinental Championship at No Way Out on February 27, losing both in a Triple Threat match with Chris Benoit (Intercontinental) and Chris Jericho (European) at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2.

==== WWF Champion (2000–2002) ====
Throughout mid-2000, Angle aligned himself with Edge &amp; Christian and feuded with Too Cool and Rikishi, with Angle defeating Rikishi in the finals of the 2000 King of the Ring tournament on June 25. Later he feuded with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. Angle then received another push and began pursuing the WWF Championship, winning the championship by defeating The Rock at No Mercy on October 22. Angle retained the WWF Championship for the rest of the year in matches with The Undertaker at Survivor Series on November 19 and in a six-man Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon on December 10. After beating Triple H at the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001, Angle eventually lost the title to The Rock at No Way Out on February 25. Angle then feuded with Chris Benoit, whom he defeated at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, but lost to him at Backlash on April 29 in an Ultimate Submission match. Continuing the feud, Angle again defeated Benoit in a two-out-of-three-falls match at Judgment Day on May 20.

When World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and ECW were purchased by the WWF in 2001, wrestlers from WCW and ECW formed The Alliance. Angle and WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin joined forces to repel them. At the Invasion event on July 22, Angle and Austin captained a team of five WWF superstars against members of the Alliance. Team WWF lost to Team Alliance when Austin turned on Team WWF to join the Alliance. Angle then began feuding with Austin over the WWF Championship and challenged him for the title at SummerSlam on August 19, and defeated Austin by disqualification. After winning and losing the WCW Championship, WCW United States Championship, and the WWF Hardcore Championship in matches with Alliance members, Angle defeated Austin to win his second WWF Championship at Unforgiven on September 23. Angle lost the title to Austin on the October 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Angle later turned heel again and joined the Alliance himself. Angle ultimately returned to the WWF side by enabling The Rock to defeat Austin in a &quot;Winner Takes All&quot; match between the WWF and The Alliance at the Survivor Series on November 18.

In his first Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002, Angle lasted until the final two before being eliminated by eventual winner Triple H. Angle briefly feuded with Kane, defeating him at WrestleMania X8 on March 17. Angle was drafted to the SmackDown! brand and then reignited his feud with Edge, defeating him at Backlash on April 21. The naturally balding Angle lost a &quot;hair versus hair&quot; match to Edge at Judgment Day on May 19, having his head shaved bald, which he would retain for the rest of his career. During mid-2002, John Cena made his WWE televised debut, losing to Angle after a roll-up pin on the June 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

In September 2002, Angle started to feud with Chris Benoit, losing to him at Unforgiven on September 22. Angle and Benoit were teamed together to participate in a tournament to crown the first WWE Tag Team Champions. They won the tournament finals at No Mercy on October 20 making Angle the fifth WWE Grand Slam Champion. The match at No Mercy was named the 2002 Match of the Year by &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;. They made their first successful title defense by defeating Los Guerreros (Eddie Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero) at Rebellion on October 26. Their reign ended after they lost the title to Edge and Mysterio on the November 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in a two-out-of-three-falls match. Angle and Benoit would receive another shot at the WWE Tag Team Championship in a triple threat elimination match against Edge and Mysterio and Los Guerreros at Survivor Series on November 17, but failed after they were the first team eliminated; Los Guerreros eventually won.

====WWE Champion and Team Angle (2002–2004)====

Angle won his third WWE Championship at Armageddon on December 15 by defeating Big Show. While still in his third reign, he gained the services of manager Paul Heyman and &quot;Team Angle&quot; (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin). He then began feuding with Brock Lesnar, who had won the Royal Rumble match on January 19, 2003. Angle lost the WWE Championship in the main event of WrestleMania XIX on March 30 to Lesnar, due to needing time off to recuperate from injuries. On April 11, 2003, Angle underwent neck surgery to repair nerve and spinal damage, calcium buildup, bone spurs, and intervertebral disc problems. Rather than remove the afflicted discs and fuse his vertebrae together, Angle opted for a less conventional surgery where only the spurs and selected portions of the discs were removed. The alternative surgery reduced Angle&#x27;s rehabilitation time from one year to three months.

In 2003, Angle returned as a face on the June 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Shortly after returning, Angle defeated Lesnar and Big Show in a triple threat match at Vengeance on July 27 to regain the WWE Championship for the fourth time. After retaining the championship against Lesnar at SummerSlam on August 24, he lost the title to Lesnar in a 60-Minute Iron Man match on the September 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Angle then formed a five-man team to rival Lesnar&#x27;s team at Survivor Series on November 16, with Angle&#x27;s team coming out victorious, despite Angle being eliminated by Lesnar.

Angle then got involved in a feud with Eddie Guerrero. At No Way Out on February 15, 2004, Guerrero defeated Lesnar to win the WWE Championship, while Angle defeated John Cena and Big Show in a triple-threat match to become the number one contender for Guerrero&#x27;s title at WrestleMania XX. He became a heel by attacking Eddie on SmackDown February 19, 2004. After losing to Guerrero at WrestleMania on March 14, Angle began to once again suffer from legitimate neck problems and went in for surgery on his neck and was not scheduled to return to action for some time. On the March 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle was made the on-screen General Manager of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Angle continued his feud with Guerrero throughout 2004. He cost Guerrero the WWE Championship against John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) in a Texas Bull Rope match at The Great American Bash on June 27 by participating in the worked finish: Angle came down to the ring and showed a replay where JBL&#x27;s shoulder hit the corner pad before Guerrero&#x27;s hand. Angle was later fired by Vince McMahon as General Manager on the July 22, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; after McMahon discovered that he was faking his handicapped status, and was put in a match against Eddie Guerrero at SummerSlam. At SummerSlam on August 15, Angle defeated Guerrero by submission. On the September 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle fought Guerrero in a lumberjack match that ended in a no-contest when a brawl broke out and Big Show made his return, attacking both Angle and Guerrero. This led to a match at No Mercy on October 3 where Angle lost to Big Show.

On the November 4, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, during an unscripted segment of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, Angle challenged the finalists to a squat thrust competition. Chris Nawrocki won the competition, with the prize being a match against Angle. Angle quickly took Nawrocki down with a guillotine choke, but Nawrocki managed to make it to the ropes, forcing Angle to break the hold. Angle then took Nawrocki down with a double leg takedown, breaking his ribs. Angle then locked another guillotine choke on Nawrocki, pinning him in the process. After Angle defeated Nawrocki, Angle challenged the other finalists. Daniel Puder, an American professional mixed martial artist, accepted Angle&#x27;s challenge. Angle and Puder wrestled for position, with Angle taking Puder down; however, in the process, Puder locked Angle in a &quot;kimura lock&quot;. With Puder on his back and Angle&#x27;s arm locked in the &quot;kimura&quot;, Angle pushed Puder&#x27;s shoulders down, pinning him; one of two referees in the ring, Jim Korderas, quickly counted three to end the bout, despite the fact that Puder&#x27;s shoulders were not fully down on the mat, bridging up at two. Puder later claimed he would have snapped Angle&#x27;s arm on national television if Korderas had not ended the match. Dave Meltzer and Dave Scherer made the following comments:

==== &quot;The Wrestling Machine&quot; (2005–2006) ====
On January 30, 2005, at the Royal Rumble, after failing to win a triple threat match for the WWE Championship, which involved Big Show and champion John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL), Angle took part in the Royal Rumble match itself. Angle was quickly eliminated by Shawn Michaels, which caused Angle to return to the ring to eliminate Michaels in retaliation. After mocking Michaels by defeating Michaels&#x27;s former tag team partner, Marty Jannetty, and attacking former manager Sherri Martel, Angle defeated Michaels in an inter-promotional match at WrestleMania 21 on April 3, which won the Pro Wrestling Illustrated (PWI) Match of the Year award. On the April 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle defeated Eddie Guerrero as part of a tournament to determine the number-one contender for the WWE Championship. In the same episode, Angle confronted fellow tournament entrant Booker T and his wife Sharmell after Sharmell predicted that Booker would win the tournament. On the April 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle and JBL interfered in a tournament match between Booker T and Big Show, rendering it a no-contest and thus creating a four-way match against the remaining tournament entrants the next week, which JBL won. Over the ensuing weeks, Angle sexually harassed Sharmell, including a segment where Angle claimed that he wanted to have &quot;bestiality sex&quot; with her. In another segment, he claimed that Sharmell had &quot;molested&quot; him and &quot;fondled his privates&quot;. At Judgment Day on May 22, Booker T defeated Angle. On the June 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle defeated Booker T and Sharmell in a 2-on-1-handicap match after pinning Sharmell in a sexual position. Angle would again lose to Booker T on the June 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, ending their feud. Angle appeared at ECW One Night Stand on June 12 as an anti-ECW &quot;crusader&quot;. At the end of the show, Angle and other &quot;crusaders&quot; engaged in a brawl with ECW alumni led by Stone Cold Steve Austin, in which the crusaders were soundly beaten.

Angle resumed his feud with Michaels upon being drafted to the Raw brand in the 2005 WWE draft lottery, losing to Michaels at Vengeance on June 26. On the July 25, 2005, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Eugene took part in the &quot;Kurt Angle Invitational&quot; challenge. Angle was unable to make Eugene submit within the three-minute time limit, winning Angle&#x27;s cherished Olympic gold medal (per match stipulation), and starting a feud between the two. The feud culminated at SummerSlam on August 21, where Angle defeated Eugene to regain his medal. Angle later feuded with John Cena for the WWE Championship. He challenged Cena at Unforgiven on September 18, but won by disqualification, therefore not winning the title. On the October 3 &quot;WWE Homecoming&quot; episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he wrestled rival Shawn Michaels to a 2–2 draw in a 30-Minute Iron Man match, after which Michaels challenged him for a sudden death overtime, but Angle refused and walked out. He challenged Cena for the WWE Championship again in a triple-threat match involving Michaels at Taboo Tuesday on November 1, but lost, and then again lost to Cena at Survivor Series on November 27. Angle would continue his feud with Cena into 2006, defeating him in a non-title first blood match on the January 2, 2006 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after interference from Daivari. At New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 8, Angle again challenged Cena for the title, this time in an Elimination Chamber match, also involving Shawn Michaels, Kane, Carlito, and Chris Masters. Angle would fail to win the match, as he was eliminated by Michaels.

On the January 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle returned to the SmackDown! brand as a surprise entrant in a twenty-man battle royal for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. Angle won by eliminating Mark Henry, becoming a face (hero) in the process. He retained the title against Henry at the Royal Rumble on January 29. Shortly after the match, The Undertaker made his return and challenged Angle for the title. At No Way Out on February 19, Angle retained the title against The Undertaker after a controversial finish where Angle pinned The Undertaker while locked in a triangle choke. Their match was highly acclaimed, with it being considered by many to be one of the best of the year. The Undertaker challenged Angle to a rematch on the March 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, where Angle lost by disqualification after Mark Henry interfered and attacked The Undertaker. This ensured that Angle would enter WrestleMania 22 as champion. Angle then began a three-way feud with Royal Rumble winner Rey Mysterio and Randy Orton (who cheated to defeat Mysterio at No Way Out to gain entrance to the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; main event at WrestleMania). At WrestleMania on April 2, Angle lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Mysterio in the triple-threat match after Mysterio pinned Orton.

On the May 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Angle was drafted to the newly created ECW brand. It was during this time that he acquired the nickname &quot;The Wrestling Machine&quot;, wearing a mouth guard and quickly squashing opponents. Upon coming to &quot;ECW&quot;, he issued an open challenge for ECW One Night Stand on June 11, which was accepted by Randy Orton. Angle defeated Orton, later losing to him in a rematch at Vengeance on June 25. On the June 27 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Angle challenged ECW World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam to a title match, which he lost. Angle appeared sporadically on WWE television throughout mid-2006. On August 25, 2006, Angle was granted an early release from his WWE contract for health reasons. Angle stated in the &quot;Kurt Angle: Champion&quot; documentary DVD that he asked for his release from WWE because he could not take time off and was working hurt, severely so on some occasions. He also stated that when he quit, WWE lost their top talent, as he was at the very top of the payroll. Angle wrestled his last match at an &quot;ECW&quot; house show on August 14, where he defeated Danny Doring.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2006–2016) ===

==== The Angle Alliance (2006–2008) ====

Angle signed a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).

In 2006, Angle made his TNA debut on October 19 as a face, confronting Samoa Joe after Joe refused to relinquish the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt that, according to the storyline, he had stolen from Jeff Jarrett. The two men ended up fighting while Jarrett retrieved the title belt. Angle was then the special enforcer for the title vs. career match between Jarrett and Sting at Bound for Glory on October 22. However, as part of the worked finish, he took out referee Rudy Charles and assumed the referee&#x27;s role for the rest of the match-up. Angle&#x27;s first match with TNA took place on the November 16 airing of &quot;Impact!&quot;, where he defeated Abyss with the ankle lock and was attacked after the match by Samoa Joe. At Genesis on November 19, Angle defeated Samoa Joe, ending Joe&#x27;s undefeated streak.

At Final Resolution on January 14, 2007, Angle defeated Samoa Joe in a thirty-minute Iron Man match 3–2 to earn a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Against All Odds on February 11, which he lost to Christian Cage after interference from Tomko and Scott Steiner. This led to a feud between Angle and Steiner, with Angle pinning Steiner at Destination X on March 11. After Angle defeated Steiner, he was picked to lead a team of four other wrestlers against a team of Christian Cage&#x27;s choice in a Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown on April 15. Angle chose Samoa Joe, Rhino, Sting, and Jeff Jarrett for Team Angle, while Cage chose A.J. Styles, Scott Steiner, Tomko, and Abyss. The man who gained the winning pinfall was to become the number one contender to Christian Cage&#x27;s NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Team Angle was victorious after Jeff Jarrett hit Abyss with a gimmicked guitar full of thumbtacks and allowed Sting to score the pin fall victory. Cage was set to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Sting and Angle in a triple-threat match at Sacrifice on May 13. The day of Sacrifice, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), the owners of the NWA World Heavyweight and the NWA World Tag Team Championships, stripped Cage of the title and Team 3D of the tag team title. NWA Executive Director Robert K. Trobich gave the reason as Cage&#x27;s refusing to defend the NWA title at NWA live events. At Sacrifice, Cage, still holding the physical NWA Championship belt, defended what was billed as the &quot;World Heavyweight Championship&quot; against Angle and Sting. Angle was the victor by making Sting submit, who had technically just pinned Cage, and he was announced as the new &quot;World Heavyweight Champion&quot;. At the &quot;Impact!&quot; following the event, Angle came to the ring with a new championship belt, and announced he was the new &quot;TNA World Heavyweight Champion&quot;. Afterward, Cage and Sting came to the ring and the three began to argue over who was the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. Due to the controversial finish to their match at Sacrifice, the title was declared vacant by Cornette. A tournament was held for the title which culminated in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary on June 17. There, Angle became the TNA World Heavyweight Champion by defeating Cage, Samoa Joe, A.J. Styles, and Chris Harris. He then attacked Joe after denying a request for a handshake, reigniting their feud and turning heel in the process.

At Victory Road on July 15, newly crowned X Division Champion Samoa Joe teamed with Kurt Angle to face TNA Tag Team Champions Team 3D, with the stipulation that if a wrestler pinned the other opponent, he won his championship. As part of the planned outcome of the match, Joe pinned Brother Ray of Team 3D to win both tag team belts, which he held by himself. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Joe, now holding the X Division and TNA World Tag Team Championships, challenged Angle, the reigning TNA World Heavyweight and (IGF recognized) IWGP Heavyweight Champion, to a winner-take-all match at Hard Justice on August 12. While illustrating how he would take away everything important in Angle&#x27;s life, Joe brought Angle&#x27;s wife Karen into the fray, as she demanded a divorce. During the match at Hard Justice, however, Karen turned on Joe when she, along with a supposed new &quot;boyfriend&quot; accompanying her that night, both aided Angle. (The boyfriend was portrayed by Marc Predka, who was soon revealed to have added rap vocals to a new version of Angle&#x27;s theme song. Angle would use this version for the rest of his time with TNA.) Angle won, gaining all the championships and becoming the second Triple Crown champion in TNA and the first to hold all three titles at the same time. Including the IWGP title, this made Angle a quadruple champion (and since Joe held the tag team titles by himself, that meant Angle&#x27;s victory gave him both tag team championship belts, meaning Angle was now in possession of five belts). Angle, however, dropped both the X Division and Tag Team Championships to Jay Lethal and Team Pacman, respectively, at No Surrender on September 9. At Bound for Glory on October 14, Angle lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Sting, but won it back on the October 25 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;.

Angle then joined forces with A.J. Styles and Tomko as The Angle Alliance at Turning Point on December 2, against Samoa Joe, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall. Styles had planned for Christian&#x27;s Coalition and The Angle Alliance to team up together. However, Christian Cage demanded to be the leader of The Angle Alliance after Cage denied Angle&#x27;s request that he be Angle&#x27;s &quot;lackey&quot;. At Final Resolution on January 6, 2008, Angle successfully defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Cage, due to interference from Styles, and again at Against All Odds on February 10, with help from Tomko. At Lockdown on April 13, Angle lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Samoa Joe after being pinned.

==== Main Event Mafia (2008–2009) ====

After suffering a neck injury, Angle was out of action. In the storyline, he returned to &quot;Impact!&quot; to ask his estranged wife Karen to reunite with him, but she declined his offer. Later that night, after Styles suffered a beating at the hands of Team 3D, Booker T, and Tomko, Angle added to the mugging by hitting Styles with a steel chair. At Slammiversary on June 8, Angle lost to Styles, being pinned after interference from Karen. At Victory Road on July 13, Angle and Team 3D won a six-man tag team Full Metal Mayhem match defeating the team of Christian Cage, Rhino, and Styles. At Hard Justice on August 10, Angle once again lost to Styles – this time in a Last Man Standing match. The feud continued on the next episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, with Styles winning Angle&#x27;s gold medal in a mock amateur wrestling match. The next week Angle challenged Styles to a ladder match for the Olympic gold medal. As they both stood on the top of the ladder, the arena went dark and Jeff Jarrett&#x27;s music played. When the lights turned on, Styles had a guitar and performed an &quot;Acoustic Equalizer&quot; on Angle to win the match. Angle began a feud with Jarrett after No Surrender on September 14, when Jarrett hit Angle with his guitar, during a match that involved Angle, Christian Cage and Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the October 2 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Mick Foley announced that he was going to be the special enforcer for Angle&#x27;s match with Jarrett at Bound for Glory IV on October 12. Angle lost to Jarrett in this match, being pinned after taking the mandible claw from Foley and a guitar shot and Stroke from Jarrett. He started attacking other superstars backstage in order to get a rematch against Jarrett. On the first HD &quot;Impact!&quot;, Angle, Booker T, Kevin Nash, and Sting started a new stable of legends called The Main Event Mafia. Scott Steiner joined the group the following week. Angle then defeated Abyss at Turning Point on November 9 in a Falls Count Anywhere match. After weeks of being pestered by Angle to give him a rematch, Jarrett said that if Angle could defeat Rhino at Final Resolution on December 7, with Mick Foley as the Special Enforcer, he would grant it. Angle defeated Rhino to earn a rematch with Jarrett at Genesis on January 11, 2009 after Al Snow made a surprise appearance and distracted Foley so that Angle could cheat. At Sacrifice on May 24, Angle lost his leadership of the Main Event Mafia to Sting because of their match&#x27;s stipulation. On June 21 at Slammiversary, Angle won the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the fourth time in a King of the Mountain match with help from Samoa Joe. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Angle regained leadership of the Main Event Mafia after he and the rest of the Main Event Mafia attacked Sting while introducing Joe as their newest member. At No Surrender on September 20, Angle lost his championship to A.J. Styles in a five-way match which also included Matt Morgan, Sting, and Hernandez.

==== Various feuds (2009–2011) ====
After defeating Morgan at Bound for Glory on October 18, Angle came out on the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; and touted the younger talent of TNA, thus leaving the Main Event Mafia and turning face in the process. Afterward, he was assaulted by the debuting Desmond Wolfe, who defeated him via knockout in a street fight the following week. At Turning Point on November 15, Angle defeated Wolfe in a rematch. The following month at Final Resolution on December 20, Angle faced Wolfe in a &quot;Three Degrees of Pain&quot; two out of three falls match. Wolfe managed to gain the first fall by pinning Angle following the Tower of London, but Angle forced him to submit with the ankle lock to win the second fall. In the final fall, which could only be won by escaping the Six Sides of Steel, Angle managed to escape first and won the match. On the January 4, 2010, live, three-hour, Monday night edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Angle received a shot at A.J. Styles&#x27; World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated in the main event of the show. Two weeks later at Genesis on January 17, Angle received one last shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but was once again defeated by Styles, who turned heel with the help of Ric Flair and struck Angle with the title belt. As a result, Angle was barred from challenging for the title as long as Styles is the title holder. Due to the circumstances surrounding the loss, Hulk Hogan gave Angle another shot at Styles and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship on the January 21 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, but this time Angle lost the match after referee Earl Hebner, who was later revealed to have been paid off by Flair, called for the bell to be rung, in an incident similar to the Montreal Screwjob. Angle responded to the incident by spitting in Hogan&#x27;s face, threatening to quit TNA and go back to WWE. Angle apologized to Hogan, after being saved by him from Scott Hall and Syxx-Pac. At Against All Odds on February 14, Angle took part in the 8 Card Stud Tournament to crown a new number-one contender, but was defeated in the first round by Mr. Anderson, after Anderson used Angle&#x27;s dog tags to choke and strike him. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Angle promised to make Anderson suffer for disrespecting the U.S. soldiers, but was in the end once again defeated by him, effectively starting a feud between the two. At Destination X on March 21, Angle defeated Anderson in a rematch. Angle and Anderson were scheduled for a rubber match inside a steel cage at Lockdown on April 18. On the April 5 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Anderson defeated Angle in a ladder match to win possession of the key to the cage door. At Lockdown, Angle defeated Anderson in a steel cage match and afterwards announced that he would take some time off from wrestling.

Angle returned on the May 20, 2010, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; and was ranked number two by the Championship Committee in the inaugural top 10 rankings for a World Heavyweight title shot. Angle, however, decided to take his name out of the running for a title shot and vowed to fight his way through the top 10 and earn his spot at the top of the company. At Slammiversary VIII on June 13, Angle started his climb back to the top by defeating Kazarian, who was ranked number ten. Angle continued his climb, defeating Desmond Wolfe, who was ranked number nine prior to the match, on the June 24 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, and D&#x27;Angelo Dinero, ranked number eight, at Victory Road on July 11. Prior to his match with Dinero, Angle announced that should he lose on his way to the top of the rankings, he would retire from professional wrestling. On the July 22 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Angle defeated seventh-ranked Hernandez and followed that up three weeks later by defeating sixth-ranked A.J. Styles. On the August 19 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the TNA World Heavyweight Championship was vacated and, instead of continuing his climb, Angle was entered into an eight-man tournament for the title, defeating X Division Champion Douglas Williams in his first-round match. At No Surrender on September 5, Angle first wrestled Jeff Hardy to a twenty-minute time limit draw, after which Eric Bischoff ordered five minutes of extra time. After that and a second five minutes of extra time, also ending in draws, it was ruled that, due to a cut, Angle could not continue the match, ending the match as no-contest. After wrestling to a draw on the September 16 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, it was announced that both Angle and Hardy had advanced to the finals at Bound for Glory on October 10, to wrestle Mr. Anderson in a three-way match.

At Bound for Glory, Angle was defeated by Hardy, when he turned heel and pinned Anderson after an interference from Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff, who then went on to form an alliance named Immortal, with Hardy, Abyss, and Jeff Jarrett. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Angle came out to make his retirement speech, after his failed attempt to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but was interrupted by Jarrett, who announced that he had made a deal with Hogan and Bischoff in order to end Angle&#x27;s career at Bound for Glory, before attacking Angle, when he was restrained by TNA&#x27;s security officers Gunner and Murphy. The following week Angle returned, trying to get his hands on Bischoff and Ric Flair, before being stopped by TNA&#x27;s security officers. Angle returned three weeks later on the November 11 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, saving Samoa Joe from Jeff Jarrett, Gunner, and Murphy. After not appearing again for two weeks, Angle made another return on the December 2 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, saving Samoa Joe from Jeff Jarrett and Abyss.

On the January 6, 2011, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Angle interrupted Jarrett&#x27;s $100,000 Mixed Martial Arts Challenge and signed a contract to face him at Genesis on January 9 in an MMA exhibition match, since he had promised not to wrestle again. The match was nullified in the third round after Jarrett blinded Angle. After the match Jarrett bloodied Angle, before announcing that he was ending his mixed martial arts career and promising that his wife, Karen Jarrett (formerly Karen Angle), would join the retirement party. On the January 13 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Karen made her return and stopped Angle just as he was about to attack Jeff, telling him that she would not allow him to ruin their personal lives and promised to tell all about their divorce the following week. The following week Karen slapped Kurt, providing a distraction which allowed Jeff to strike him. At the end of the show Crimson saved Angle from a beating at the hands of Immortal and Fortune. The following week, Ric Flair reinstated Angle in order to place him and Crimson in a seven–on–two handicap match against Jarrett, James Storm, Robert Roode, Kazarian, Rob Terry, Gunner, and Murphy. The match ended with Jarrett pinning Angle for the win. Afterwards, Angle was saved from another beating by the returning Scott Steiner. The following week Fortune turned on Immortal and aligned themselves with Angle, Crimson and Steiner. On February 13 at Against All Odds, Jarrett defeated Angle in a singles match and as a result Angle was forced to walk Karen down the aisle, when she and Jarrett renewed their wedding vows on the March 3 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. After the match Angle hinted at a possible retirement by leaving his wrestling boots in the ring. On March 3, Angle proceeded to destroy the wedding set with an axe and forced wedding guest New York Jet Bart Scott to submit with the ankle lock. On April 17 at Lockdown, Jarrett defeated Angle in an &quot;Ultra Male Rules&quot; two out of three falls steel cage match, with help from Karen. On the May 12 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Angle revealed Chyna as his backup in taking care of the Jarretts. At Sacrifice on May 15, Angle and Chyna defeated the Jarretts in a mixed tag team match. Later that same month, Angle signed a new three-year contract with TNA. With Karen out of the picture, Angle defeated Jarrett on June 12 at Slammiversary IX, in what was billed as the &quot;final battle&quot; between the two to retain his Olympic gold medal and become the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. However, on the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Jarrett challenged Angle to a Parking Lot Brawl and agreed to sign a contract that would force him to move to Mexico without Angle&#x27;s children, should he lose the match. Angle ended up winning the fight after choking Jarrett with a shirt, forcing him to say &quot;adiós&quot;.

==== Immortal (2011–2012) ====
In 2011, with his feud with Jarrett behind him, Angle aligned himself with Sting to feud with the rest of Immortal, including the group&#x27;s newest member, TNA World Heavyweight Champion Mr. Anderson.

On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Angle explained that he did not agree with Sting, who, using the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, wanted to hand the promotion back to Dixie Carter, as he had found out that she had lied to him about not knowing of the relationship between Karen and Jeff Jarrett. When Sting confronted Angle, he was attacked by Hogan, which led to Angle revealing that Hogan had been the one who had exposed Carter&#x27;s lie to him. Angle also revealed that his goal was now to ruin Carter&#x27;s youth movement in TNA by eliminating the younger wrestlers one-by-one, and started by attacking Bound for Glory Series leader Crimson after the main event, cementing his heel turn. Angle made his first televised title defense on the September 1 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, defeating Sting in a rematch, following interference from special enforcer Hulk Hogan and the rest of Immortal. The following week, Angle&#x27;s title match with Mr. Anderson ended in a disqualification, following interference from Immortal.

The following week, Angle was sidelined with a storyline injury after Knox hit him in the neck with a ball-peen hammer. Angle returned to in-ring action on the January 31 &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, defeating Aces &amp; Eights member Mr. Anderson in a steel cage match. Afterwards, Angle&#x27;s two allies Garett Bischoff and Wes Brisco revealed themselves as members of Aces &amp; Eights and attacked him. Angle infiltrated the Aces &amp; Eights hideout on the February 28 &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; and managed to unmask their vice president, but was beaten by the other members before he could reveal his identity to the cameras. Angle revealed the vice president as D&#x27;Lo Brown on the following episode of &quot;Impact&quot;.

Angle then began feuding with A.J. Styles, after Styles refused to answer Angle&#x27;s question on whether he is with TNA or the Aces &amp; Eights, which led to a brawl between the two on the May 9, 2013, episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. On June 2 at Slammiversary XI, Angle was announced as the second inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame. Later that night, Angle defeated Styles in a singles match.

==== Director of Wrestling Operations (2013–2014) ====
Angle returned on the October 10, 2013, episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, attacking EGO and challenging Bobby Roode to a match at Bound For Glory. The following week, Angle stated his discontentment with Roode mocking his Hall of Fame induction and told Roode he would make him tap out. Roode responded by attacking Angle with help from his faction, EGO, forcing Angle to submit to the crossface hold in a precursory act prior to their match. At the PPV Angle was inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame, but he refused to accept the offer as he felt he had let himself, TNA, and the fans down and didn&#x27;t deserve a Hall of Fame induction ceremony. He also said he would accept the offer when he feels he has earned it, and he still has great things to do in TNA. Later in that night, Angle was defeated by Roode, after he landed awkwardly from a running belly-to-belly suplex. On the October 31 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Angle lied about gaining medical clearance, as Angle suffered (kayfabe) convulsions during the match against Bobby Roode after a bad landing from the same move, which resulted in referee Brian Hebner rewarding a knock out/count-out victory to Roode. After the match, he also showed signs of post-concussive amnesia. On November 5, Angle was reported as having tested negative for the concussion, but his recurring knee injuries still required monitoring. The following week, Angle saw the New Main Event Mafia disbanded, then he was attacked by Roode, who accused Angle as using his injuries to get out of the match. On November 14, Angle won a submission match against Austin Aries in the World title tournament, but by using Roode&#x27;s finisher: the &quot;arm trap crossface&quot;, with Roode at the ramp watching.

At Final Resolution, Angle was defeated by Roode in a 2-out-of 3 falls match, but Angle faced and defeated Roode in a Steel Cage match at Genesis to end the feud.

On February 6, 2014, Angle had a match against Magnus. However, he won by disqualification, when Ethan Carter III (EC3) attacked Angle, performing a leglock, which injured Angle&#x27;s knee. On February 27, 2014, Angle officially accepted his induction into the TNA Hall of Fame, but the ceremony was interrupted by EC3, with Angle attacking him. The next week, Angle was attacked by EC3 and his knees were severely damaged, thus losing his chance to fight at Lockdown. Angle made his return on April 17, and vowing revenge. On April 24, after Angle defeated Rockstar Spud in a match, EC3 attacked Angle but Willow saved him. At Sacrifice, Willow and Angle defeated EC3 and Rockstar Spud. In May, Angle underwent ACL repair surgery and was sidelined.

On June 20, 2014, Angle was named Executive Director of Wrestling Operations of TNA by TNA&#x27;s board of directors. He announced a TNA World Heavyweight Championship rematch for the July 3 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; between Lashley and Eric Young, and reinstated Bobby Roode, who had been indefinitely suspended by MVP. Angle also retired the TNA Television Championship, which had not been seen or defended since Abyss won it at Slammiversary 2013. On September 18, 2014 (aired on October 29 due to tape delay), Angle refereed the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between Bobby Roode and Bobby Lashley. Angle&#x27;s contract with TNA was due to expire on September 14, 2014. Around this time, he reached out to Vince McMahon to offer his services for a return to the WWE. Unbeknownst to him Triple H had taken over McMahon&#x27;s former duties. Angle offered to return as a part-time wrestler due to concerns of his age and health. Angle was caught off guard when WWE declined his services. It is speculated that WWE only offered a full-time contract which Angle didn&#x27;t accept or WWE declined his return due to past relationship issues with him. After he was denied by WWE, he quickly signed a part-time contract with TNA Wrestling. On September 21, 2014, Angle&#x27;s contract with TNA expired, ending his eight-year tenure with the company. Angle teased a return to WWE; however, he was offered a full-time contract by TNA; so, Angle decided to stay.

On February 1, 2025, Angle was acknowledged amongst other legends at ringside at the Royal Rumble.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
When Angle began to train as a professional wrestler, he was asked to not watch old tapes, since the style had changed during the Attitude Era and the matches were more aggressive. Instead, he learned by watching then-current wrestlers such as Steve Austin, Triple H, or The Rock. Angle said his match against The Rock at No Way Out 2001 was the transition between the &quot;funny, goofy Kurt Angle to a more serious competitor&quot;, including more offense.

Angle&#x27;s Olympic gold medal has frequently been incorporated into his professional wrestling persona. His personality varies depending on his alignment as a face or heel. As a face, Angle usually performs as a role model; but as a heel arrogantly uses his achievements to insult other people. He mixes aspects from his amateur wrestling background with his in-ring work, performing various suplexes, including the belly-to-back, German, and belly-to-belly, as well as submissions, such as the rear naked choke or the triangle choke. He primarily performs two finishing maneuvers to end his matches: an Olympic slam, dubbed &quot;Angle Slam&quot;, and an ankle lock.

During Angle&#x27;s entrances in WWE, it is common for fans to chant &quot;you suck!&quot; to the tune of his entrance music. The chants originated during Angle&#x27;s feud with The Rock in February 2001, but gained popularity during his feud with Edge in 2002. The chants have become a trademark of Angle&#x27;s persona, regardless if he is a face or heel. The theme song was later adopted by UFC fighter Colby Covington.

==Video games==
Angle appeared in every WWE/F video game from 2000&#x27;s &quot;WWF Royal Rumble&quot; up to &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007&quot;, released in 2006.

Angle expressed interest in pursuing an acting career after retiring from professional wrestling. In 2008, he made his film debut as a racist prison deputy in the short film &quot;Chains&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chains (2009/II short)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he played serial killer Brad Mayfield in the film &quot;End Game&quot;. On a third-season episode of &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot;, he was teamed up with Jimmy Smith and Kendall Gill against the Joes. Angle appeared in the &quot;Car Wreck Vanish&quot; episode of &quot;Criss Angel Mindfreak&quot;. He played Russian MMA champion Koba (in a non-speaking role) in the 2011 film &quot;Warrior&quot;, and starred as town sheriff Will Logan in the film &quot;River of Darkness&quot;.

On the &quot;Right After Wrestling&quot; program on Sirius Satellite Radio, Angle revealed he would become a part-time wrestler after his contract expired in 2011 to focus on Angle Foods and his acting career. In the 2013 film &quot;Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies&quot;, he plays himself as both a human and a zombie. Angle also had a small role in the 2014 cult-film &quot;Sharknado 2: The Second One&quot; and in the 2014 romantic-comedy film &quot;Not Cool&quot;. He appeared in the film &quot;The Last Witch Hunter&quot;. He also made a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;Pain and Gain&quot;, in which he brawls with Dwayne Johnson&#x27;s character in a prison fight. Angle appeared on an episode of &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot; in February 2016.

In 2010, it was reported that Angle was engaged to actress Giovanna Yannotti. Angle and Yannotti were married on July 20, 2012. They have three children, one of whom was adopted.

Angle is a Christian. He supported Marco Rubio in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries. He is a supporter of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Coventry City F.C.. In July 2015, Angle underwent emergency surgery to remove fluid buildup on his spinal cord after all of his extremities had become numb. A week before this emergency, he had surgery to remove a benign tumor from his neck.

In 2007, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that Angle&#x27;s name was found in the client database of a Florida wellness center suspected of being a front for distributing performance enhancing drugs. The magazine alleged that Angle had received prescriptions for trenbolone (which is not approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration) and nandrolone, both anabolic steroids. Angle denied the allegations, commenting that his neck issues were well documented. Angle only failed a drugs test under WWE&#x27;s Wellness Policy because his prescription for nandrolone had expired. Angle has been open about struggles with addiction to prescription pain medication. He claims that he developed an addiction to pain killers in 2003, and that his addictions got so out of control that at one point he was taking up to 65 extra-strength Vicodin per day. Angle states that after completing rehabilitation following a 2013 DUI arrest, he has been clean and sober.

=== Legal issues ===
In September 2007, Angle was arrested by the Moon Township Police Department in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, a part of the Greater Pittsburgh area, on a DUI charge, after police received a report of an erratic driver leaving a local bar. Angle was charged with driving under the influence and careless driving after police traced the description of the car to his home. Angle was later found not guilty on those charges when the complaining witness was unable to corroborate her story.

On August 15, 2009, Angle was again arrested by the Moon Township Police Department. His girlfriend stated that she had filed a protection from abuse (PFA) order and that he was stalking her in the Robinson area. Angle was charged with &quot;driving while operating privilege is suspended, prohibited acts-possession, harassment and prohibited acts&quot;. Hygetropin, a human growth hormone, was found in his car; Angle maintained that he had a prescription for the drug. On September 15, a District Court judge dropped the harassment, suspended license, and drug charges against Angle. On November 9, the PFA charges were dropped after he and former girlfriend Trenesha Biggers reached an agreement to avoid contact with each other.

On March 25, 2011, Angle was arrested by North Dakota Highway Patrol officers in Thompson, North Dakota, and charged with &quot;being in control of a motor vehicle while intoxicated&quot;, after failing a field sobriety test. Angle later pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced on April 20 to one year of unsupervised probation, a chemical dependency evaluation, a $250 fine, $225 in court fees, and a ten-day suspended sentence.

Angle was arrested in the early morning of September 4, 2011, by Virginia State Troopers for allegedly driving under the influence. Angle was placed in Warren County Jail, before posting $2,000 bail and being released. State police revealed that Angle&#x27;s initial breath test at the scene, where he was stopped by police, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.091 percent, which was above the legal limit of 0.08 percent. The test was later ruled not admissible; and when a second test, taken at the police station, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06, the DUI charge was dropped. Angle was still charged with reckless driving. On November 8, 2011, Angle entered a plea of no contest and was fined $1,500.

On August 2, 2013, Angle was arrested by Texas Highway Patrol officers and charged with driving while intoxicated in Decatur, Texas. Later that day, Angle announced he was immediately entering a drug rehabilitation center.

<text>Bronson Alcott Pinchot (; born May 20, 1959) is an American actor. He is best known for playing Balki Bartokomous on the ABC sitcom &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; (1986–1993). He also performed in films, such as &quot;Risky Business&quot; (1983), &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984), &quot;After Hours&quot; (1985), &quot;True Romance&quot; (1993), &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; (1994), &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s The Langoliers&quot; (1995), &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; (1996), &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; (1996), &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1996) and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F&quot; (2024), and in television series, such as &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;Meego&quot; and &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;. In 2012, he starred in his own reality series, &quot;The Bronson Pinchot Project&quot; on the DIY Network.

Pinchot has worked extensively as an audiobook narrator, with over 400 recordings as of 2024. &quot;AudioFile&quot; magazine recognized him as Best Voice in Fiction &amp; Classics for his 2010 renderings of Flannery O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;Everything That Rises Must Converge&quot; (1965), Karl Marlantes&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2009) and David Vann&#x27;s &quot;Caribou Island&quot; (2011).

== Early life ==
Pinchot was born in New York City. He grew up with his mother, two brothers, and a sister. His mother, Rosina, was a typist and house cleaner, while his father, a bookbinder born in New York and raised in Paris, abandoned the family. This abandonment plunged the family into poverty. Pinchot&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Russian immigrants who settled in France following the Russian Revolution. Upon returning to the United States, his father changed the family surname from Poncharavsky to Pinchot.

When Pinchot was two and a half years old, the family moved to South Pasadena, California. In school, he faced bullying and was often mocked for his appearance, being called &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;fat.&quot; Despite these challenges, Pinchot excelled academically, graduating at the top of his class from South Pasadena High School. His achievements earned him a full scholarship to Yale University, where he lived at Morse College. Although he initially planned to study fine arts, he ultimately majored in theater studies, graduating with honors. After college, a casting director discovered Pinchot, which led to his film debut in &quot;Risky Business.&quot;.

== Career ==

Pinchot appeared in several feature films, such as &quot;Hot Resort&quot;, &quot;Risky Business&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, &quot;True Romance&quot;, &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;. He also played Dennis Kemper in the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;Sara&quot;. Pinchot was hired to replace Fisher Stevens as Ben Jabituya in the 1986 film &quot;Short Circuit&quot;, but Pinchot eventually left the production in order to begin work on &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, and Stevens was subsequently rehired for the role.

Starting in 1986, Pinchot played Balki Bartokomous on the long-running ABC sitcom &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;. When the show concluded filming its eight-season run in September 1992 (with the condensed final season airing during the summer of 1993), Pinchot secured the starring role on a new sitcom for CBS, entitled &quot;The Trouble with Larry&quot;. The series premiered just three weeks after ABC&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; finale in August 1993, and one episode (which never aired) was directed by Mark Linn-Baker, Pinchot&#x27;s co-star on &quot;Strangers&quot;. After three weeks of dismal ratings and poor reviews, &quot;The Trouble with Larry&quot; was canceled. Pinchot would subsequently be rehired by &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; producers Tom Miller and Bob Boyett for roles on two more of their sitcoms: &quot;Step By Step&quot;, where he played French hairdresser Jean-Luc Rieupeyroux in early 1997, and, that fall, on &quot;Meego&quot;, where he played an alien who crash-landed on Earth.

In 2008, Pinchot read the audio version of &quot;The Learners&quot;, author Chip Kidd&#x27;s followup to &quot;The Cheese Monkeys&quot;. He also voiced Max, the fully restored Black 1964 VW Beetle, in the 2009 Volkswagen &quot;Das Auto&quot; campaign. Between 2009 and 2014, Pinchot narrated over 100 audiobooks. In 2010, Pinchot read the audio version of the novels &quot;&quot; and &quot;Blood Oath&quot;. For the Blackstone Audio collection &quot;Patricia Highsmith: Selected Novels and Short Stories,&quot; he provided a reading of several stories, including &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;. Pinchot also narrated for Christopher Healy&#x27;s children&#x27;s series, &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Guide&quot;. He was recognized for his work with a number of awards, including Audible.com&#x27;s 2010 Narrator of the Year.

On February 12, 2012, Pinchot starred in a home restoration show on DIY Network titled &quot;The Bronson Pinchot Project&quot;. The program is based on his hobby of restoring old homes using salvaged materials. On March 8, 2018, it was announced that Pinchot would play George Hawthorne, the villainous, puritanical principal of Baxter High, who regularly clashes with Sabrina Spellman and her friends in the Netflix series &quot;The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;. The series premiered in October 2018.

== Personal life ==
Pinchot was engaged to Marcy Walker in 1983–84.

In 1999, he spent a great deal of time in Harford, Pennsylvania, restoring the circa 1839 mansion built by Joab Tyler (father of historian William Seymour Tyler) and later inhabited by former Pennsylvania state Senator Edward E. Jones. Pinchot purchased six properties in the small rural town of 1,300 residents &quot;in an effort to revive the town&#x27;s 19th-century aesthetic&quot;. In 2015 he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, claiming liabilities between $100,000 and $500,000. All of his properties in Harford were subsequently put up for sale. Pinchot told the Wilkes-Barre &quot;Citizens&#x27; Voice&quot;, &quot;I have two skills: I can make old houses beautiful and I can make people laugh. Other than that I&#x27;m a waste of space. Well, I&#x27;m a dedicated son and brother, but I have no head for businesses.&quot; By April 2017, he owned two tiny homes, one measuring 77 square feet, the other 153 square feet.

<text>Vinyon is a synthetic fiber made from polyvinyl chloride. In some countries other than the United States, vinyon fibers are referred to as polyvinyl chloride fibers. It can bind non-woven fibers and fabrics. It was invented in 1939.

It has the same health problems associated with chlorinated polymers. In the past, Vinyon was used a substitute for plant-based filters in tea bags.

==Vinyon fiber characteristics==
* doesn&#x27;t flame, but softens at low temperatures(55 C)
* high resistance to chemicals
* Moisture absorption is less than 0.5% and moisture regained is less than 0.1%
* crease resistant and elastic
==Major vinyon fiber uses==
* industrial applications as a bonding agent for non-woven fabrics and products

==Production==
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission definition for vinyon fiber is &quot;A manufactured fiber in which the fiber-forming substance is any long chain synthetic polymer composed of at least 85 percent by weight of vinyl chloride units (—CH2—CHCl—).&quot;

First U.S. commercial vinyon fiber production: 1939, FMC Corporation, Fiber Division (formerly American Viscose Corporation).

<text>The blogosphere is made up of all blogs and their interconnections. The term implies that blogs exist together as a connected community (or as a collection of connected communities) or as a social networking service in which everyday authors can publish their opinions and views.

== History ==
The term was coined on September 10, 1999 by Brad L. Graham, as a joke. It was re-coined in 2002 by William Quick, and was quickly adopted and propagated by the warblog community. The term resembles the older word &quot;logosphere&quot; (from Greek &quot;logos&quot; meaning &quot;word&quot;, and &quot;sphere&quot;, interpreted as &quot;world&quot;), &quot;the world of words&quot;, the universe of discourse.

Despite the term&#x27;s humorous intent, CNN, the BBC, and National Public Radio&#x27;s programs &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, &quot;Day To Day&quot;, and &quot;All Things Considered&quot; used it several times to discuss public opinion. A number of media outlets in the late 2000s started treating the blogosphere as a gauge of public opinion, and it has been cited in both academic and non-academic work as evidence of rising or falling resistance to globalization, voter fatigue, and many other phenomena, and also in reference to identifying influential bloggers and &quot;familiar strangers&quot; in the blogosphere.

==Proliferation==
In 1999, Pyra Labs opened blogging to the masses by simplifying the process of creating and maintaining personal web spaces. Prior to the creation of Pyra&#x27;s &quot;Blogger&quot;, the number of blogs in existence was thought to be less than one hundred. Blogger led to the birth of the wider blogosphere. In 2005, a Gallup poll showed that a third of Internet users read blogs at least on occasion, and in May 2006, a study showed that there were over forty-two million bloggers contributing to the blogosphere. With less than 1 million blogs in existence at the start of 2003, the number of blogs had doubled in size every six months through 2006.

In 2011, it was estimated that there were more than 153 million blogs, with nearly 1 million new posts being produced by the blogosphere each day.

=== Revenue ===
In a 2010 Technorati study, 36% of bloggers reported some sort of income from their blogs, most often in the form of ad revenue. This shows a steady increase from their 2009 report, in which 28% of the blogging world reported their blog as a source of income, with the mean annual income from advertisements at $42,548. Other common sources of blog-related income are paid speaking engagements and paid postings. Paid postings may be subject to rules on clearly disclosing commercial advertisements as such (regulated by, for example, the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK).

==As a social network==
Sites such as Technorati, BlogPulse, and Tailrank track the interconnections between bloggers. Taking advantage of hypertext links which act as markers for the subjects the bloggers are discussing, these sites can follow a piece of conversation as it moves from blog to blog. These also can help information researchers study how fast a meme spreads through the blogosphere, to determine which sites are the most important for gaining early recognition. Sites also exist to track specific blogospheres, such as those related by a certain genre, culture, subject matter, or geopolitical location.

===Mapping===

In 2007, following six weeks of observation, social media expert Matthew Hurst mapped the blogosphere, generating the plot to the left based on the interconnections between blogs. The most densely populated areas represent the most active portions of the blogosphere. White dots represent individual blogs. They are sized according to the number of links surrounding that particular blog. Links are plotted in both green and blue, with green representing one-way links and blue representing reciprocal links.

&quot;DISCOVER Magazine&quot; described six major &#x27;hot spots&#x27; of the blogosphere. While points 1 and 2 represent influential individual blogs, point 3 is the perfect example of &quot;blogging island&quot;, where individual blogs are highly connected within a sub-community but lack many connections to the larger blogosphere. Point 4 describes a sociopolitical blogging niche, in which links demonstrate the constant dialogue between bloggers who write about the same subject of interest. Point 5 is an isolated sub-community of blogs dedicated to the world of pornography. Lastly, point 6 represents a collection of sports&#x27; lovers who largely segregate themselves but still manage to link back to the higher traffic blogs toward the center of the blogosphere.

===Merging with other social networks===
Over time, the blogosphere developed as its own network of interconnections. In this time, bloggers began to engage in other online communities, specifically social networking sites, melding the two realms of social media together.

According to Technorati&#x27;s 2010 &quot;State of the Blogosphere&quot; report, 78% of bloggers were using the microblogging service Twitter, with much larger percentages of individuals who blogged as a part-time job (88%) or full-time for a specific company (88%). Almost half of all bloggers surveyed used Twitter to interact with the readers of their blog, while 72% of bloggers used it for blog promotion. For bloggers whose blog was their business (self-employed), 63% used Twitter to market their business. Additionally, according to the report, almost 9 out of 10 (87%) bloggers were using Facebook.

News blogs have become popular, and have created competition for traditional print newspaper and news magazines. The Huffington Post was ranked the most powerful blog in the world by &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2008, and has come to dominate current event reporting.
*Political blogs are often tied to a large media or news corporation, such as &quot;The Caucus&quot; (affiliated with &quot;The New York Times&quot;), &quot;CNN Political Ticker&quot;, and the &quot;National Review&quot;″s &quot;The Corner&quot;.
*Gossip blogs have grown extensively with the development of the blogosphere. One of the first influential gossip bloggers was Perez Hilton, a celebrity and entertainment media gossip blogger. His blog posts tabloid photographs of celebrities, accompanied by captions and comments. Web traffic to the often controversial and raunchy Perez Hilton site increased significantly in 2005, prompting similar gossip blogs, such as TMZ.com to gain popularity.
*Food blogs allow chefs to share recipes, cooking techniques, and food porn. Food blogs such as 101 Cookbooks, Smitten Kitchen, and Simply Recipes can serve as online cookbooks for followers and often contain restaurant critiques, product reviews, and step-by-step photography for recipes.
*Fashion blogs have also become large sub-communities following the growth of the blogosphere. blogs like Racked, The Cut, and Fashionista give readers an eye into the fashion industry. Besides fashion news blogs, street style blogs have also become popular. Such bloggers include Scott Schuman (The Sartorialist), Tommy Ton (Jak and Jil), Jane Aldridge (Sea of Shoes), Bryan Grey-Yambao (Bryanboy), and Tavi Gevinson (Style Rookie). They are able to earn considerable livings through advertising, selling their photos and even providing their services as photographers, stylists, and guest designers.
*Health blogs cover health topics, events and/or related content of the health industry and the general community. A health blog can cover diverse health related concerns such as nutrition and diet, fitness, weight control, diseases, disease management, societal trends affecting health, analysis about health, business of health and health research.
*Scientific blogs cover different scientific and mathematical topics. Some of these are written by leading researchers, others by interested laymen. These are often free to access and thus provide an alternative to pay walled scientific literature.
*Genealogy blogs cover a variety of topics related to genealogy and family history, including the genealogy industry, genealogy software and technology, as well as educational &quot;how to&quot; posts related to specific research areas.
*Philosophy blogs both in analytic philosophy and Continental philosophy are a significant part of the blogosphere, often covering metaphysics, ethics and philosophy of language.

<doc id="346221" wikidata="Q1139103" url="?curid=346221" title="Renju">
<text>Renju () is a professional variant of the abstract strategy board game gomoku. It was named renju by Japanese journalist Ruikou Kuroiwa (黒岩涙香) on December 6, 1899, in a Japanese newspaper &quot;Yorozu chouhou&quot; (萬朝報). The name &quot;renju&quot; means &quot;connected pearls&quot; in Japanese. The game is played with black and white stones on a 15×15 gridded go board.

The rule of renju weakens the advantages for the first player (Black) in gomoku by adding special restrictions for Black.

==Rules==
Renju has its origins in gomoku and therefore shares most of its rules. There are two key differences between these games, however. First, renju has the rule of forbidden moves to limit Black&#x27;s advantage, something gomoku does not have. Second, renju utilizes special opening rules to balance the starting positions of games.

=== Forbidden moves ===
There are certain moves that Black is not allowed to make:
* Double three – Placing a stone on an intersection, which makes more than one &quot;three&quot; that meet each other in this intersection.
** &quot;Three&quot; – A row with three stones to which one can add one more stone to attain a &quot;straight four&quot;.
** &quot;Straight four&quot; – An unbroken row with four stones to which one can add one more stone to attain five in a row in two different ways.
* Double four – Placing a stone on an intersection, which makes more than one &quot;four&quot; that meet each other in this intersection.
** &quot;Four&quot; – A row with four stones to which one can add one more stone to attain five in a row.
* Overline – Six or more stones in an unbroken row.
If Black makes a forbidden move, then the game will be won for White. One exception is that, if Black makes a forbidden move and attains five in a row at the same time, it will still be considered a win for Black.

=== Pass ===
In the game, a player has the option to give up the right to place a stone on the board, which is referred to as passing. If both players choose to pass consecutively, the game is regarded as a draw.

The right of passing is usually used when the board is almost full and Black will make an overline if he places a stone on the board.

===Winning===
Black can win the game only by placing exactly five black stones in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally).

White can win by either:
* Getting five (or more) white stones in a row
* Forcing Black to make a forbidden move (see above).
===Opening rules===
Unlike gomoku, renju has a unique sequence of opening moves called an &quot;opening rule&quot;. There are several certified opening rules. The list of requirements for new opening rules as approved by the Renju International Federation (RIF) in 2003 was:

I. Traditions
* The basic renju rules must be kept.
* The opening stage must not exceed 5 moves.
* All 26 canonical openings must be possible and only 26 canonical openings can be possible.
* All present realistic variants must be possible.
* The moves located very closely near the edges of a board during the opening stage are not preferable.

II. Simplicity and attraction
* New rules must be simple to study.
* New rules must be simple to play for beginners. The situation when in significant part of cases a beginner will have the lost position already after the first 5 moves is not good.
* The rules must be systematic and attractive.

III. Creativity

* The number of possible creative variants must be significantly greater than now. These variants must be achieved under the optimal strategy of both players.
* The chances of sides to win must be practically equal.
* The situation when during the opening stage the player who make a move does not interested in the forming of equal and creative position is not preferable. (Example: indirect 2nd move in previous opening rules).
* The rules must give the chance for both players to avoid the position after the opening stage well known for the opponent.
* The knowledge of theory and deep own analyses must give an advantage but the player with a good imagination must have chances against this.

An example of such opening rule (namely &quot;RIF opening rule&quot;) follows.
# The first player places 2 black stones and 1 white stone on the board thus forming opening pattern.
# The second player now chooses whether to play black or white.
# White then places one more stone on the board.
# Black places 2 stones on the board.
# White removes one of the two black stones from the previous move.
# White places a white stone.

After this sequence is complete, Black and White continue to take turns to place their stones.

The Extra General Assembly of Renju International Federation in 2008 created three new sets of rules for openings that are to replace the above old sequence of moves: Soosõrv, Taraguchi, and Yamaguchi. Also a rejection system for their use was approved.
The General Assembly of Renju International Federation in 2009 certified Sakata opening rule as proposed by Russia.
The General Assembly of Renju International Federation in 2011 certified modified opening rules such as Taraguchi-N and Soosõrv-N.

For the opening rule of both the World Renju Championship and the Team World Renju Championship, Swap opening rule was used before 1996. However, during the Extra General Assembly 1996, RIF opening rule was approved as the official rule for World Championships, starting from World Championship 1997. Subsequently, the official rule was changed to Yamaguchi opening rule from World Championship 2009, during the Extra General Assembly 2008. Then, during the General Assembly 2015, the official rule was changed once again to Soosõrv-8 opening rule from World Championship 2017.
==Renju International Federation==

The Renju International Federation (RIF) is an international organization which was founded in Stockholm, Sweden on August 8, 1988. The main purpose of the Renju International Federation is to unite all the renju and gomoku national federations all over the world, organize international tournaments and other activities in renju and gomoku, and spread renju activities in the world. The federation carry out the General Assembly every two years.

==World Championships==

There are several world championships organized by the Renju International Federation, including World Championship, Women World Championships, Team World Championships, Youth World Championships and Correspondence World Championships.

Renju World Championships have occurred every second year, since 1989. The opening rule was Yamaguchi from 2009 to 2015, and has been changed to Soosõrv-8 since 2017. The Women World Championships started in 1997 and are played every second year, at the same time and place with the World Championships.

Team World Championships in Renju have occurred every second year since 1996. From 2010 to 2016, the opening rule was played is Yamaguchi, and since 2018 the rule has been changed to Soosõrv-8.

World Championships in Renju via Correspondence were held in 1982 to 1993 (by paper letters, later by e-mails), and now are played every year since 1996 with an exception in 2009, 2010 and 2016.

==Computers and renju==
Free Renju was solved in 2001 as a win for the first player. However, renju with modern opening rules such as Yamaguchi and Soosõrv-N have not been solved.

The Renju World Computer Championship was started in 1991, and held for four times until 2004. From 2016, Renju was added to the Gomocup tournament, taking place every year, still active now.

The first program playing with human players in public competitions is &quot;Meijin-2000&quot; developed by Oleg Stepanov, Russia. In 2000, &quot;Meijin-2000&quot; played against human players in Moscow Open Tournament. However, not until 2017 were the computer programs proved to be able to outperform top human players in public competitions. In 2017, there was a match between the world champion program Yixin and the Taiwan&#x27;s Meijin title holder Lin Shu-Hsuan, and Yixin won the match with 3-1. In 2018, there was a match between Yixin and the former world champion Qi Guan, and the match ended in a draw with 2.5-2.5.

<text>The North America Nebula (NGC 7000 or Caldwell 20) is an emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus, close to Deneb (the tail of the swan and its brightest star). It is named because its shape resembles North America.

==History==
On October 24, 1786, William Herschel observing from Slough, England, noted a “faint milky nebulosity scattered over this space, in some places pretty bright.” 
The most prominent region was catalogued by his son John Herschel on August 21, 1829. It was listed in the New General Catalogue as NGC 7000, where it is described as a &quot;faint, most extremely large, diffuse nebulosity.” 

In 1890, the pioneering German astrophotographer Max Wolf noticed this nebula&#x27;s characteristic shape on a long-exposure photograph, and dubbed it the North America Nebula.

In his study of nebulae on the Palomar Sky Survey plates in 1959, American astronomer Stewart Sharpless realised that the North America Nebula is part of the same interstellar cloud of ionized hydrogen (H II region) as the Pelican Nebula, separated by a dark band of dust, and listed the two nebulae together in his second list of 313 bright nebulae as Sh2-117. American astronomer Beverly T. Lynds catalogued the obscuring dust cloud as L935 in her 1962 compilation of dark nebulae. Dutch radio astronomer Gart Westerhout detected the HII region Sh2-117 as a strong radio emitter, 3° across, and it appears as W80 in his 1958 catalogue of radio sources in the band of the Milky Way.

==General information==

The North America Nebula covers a region more than ten times the area of the full moon, but its surface brightness is low, so normally it cannot be seen with the unaided eye. Binoculars and telescopes with large fields of view (approximately 3°) will show it as a foggy patch of light under sufficiently dark skies. However, using a UHC filter, which filters out some unwanted wavelengths of light, it can be seen without magnification under dark skies. Its shape and reddish color (from the hydrogen Hα emission line) show up only in photographs of the area.

The portion of the nebula resembling Mexico and Central America is known as the Cygnus Wall. This region exhibits the most concentrated star formation.

At optical wavelengths, the North America Nebula and the Pelican Nebula (IC 5070) appear distinct as they are separated by the silhouette of the dark band of interstellar dust L935. The dark cloud is however transparent to radio waves and infrared radiation, and these wavelengths reveal the central regions of Sh2-117 that are not visible to an ordinary telescope, including many highly luminous stars.

==Distance and size==

The distances to the North America and Pelican nebulae were controversial, because there are few precise methods for determining how far away an HII region lies. Until 2020, most astronomers accepted a value of 2,000 light years, though estimates ranged from 1,500 to 3,000 light years. But in 2020, the Gaia astrometry spacecraft measured the distances to 395 stars lying within the HII region, giving the North America and Pelican nebulae a distance of 2,590 light years (795±25 parsecs). The entire HII region Sh2-117 is estimated to be 140 light years across, and the North America nebula stretches 90 light years north to south.

==Ionising star==
HII regions shine because their hydrogen gas is ionised by the ultraviolet radiation from a hot star. In 1922, Edwin Hubble proposed that Deneb may be responsible for lighting up the North America Nebula, but it soon became apparent that it is not hot enough: Deneb has a surface temperature of 8,500 K, while the nebula&#x27;s spectrum shows it is being heated by a star hotter than 30,000 K. In addition, Deneb is well away from the middle of the complete North America/Pelican Nebula complex (Sh2-117), and by 1958 George Herbig realised that the ionizing star had to lie behind the central dark cloud L935. In 2004, European astronomers Fernando Comerón and Anna Pasquali searched for the ionizing star behind L935 at infrared wavelengths, using data from the 2MASS survey, and then made detailed observations of likely suspects with the 2.2 m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain. One star, catalogued J205551.3+435225, fulfilled all the criteria. Lying right in the centre of Sh2-117, with a temperature of over 40,000 K, it is almost certainly the ionising star for the North America and Pelican nebulae.

Later observations have revealed J205551.3+435225 is a spectral type O3.5 star, with another hot star (type O8) in orbit. J205551.3+435225 lies just off the “Florida coast” of the North America Nebula, so it has been more conveniently nicknamed the Bajamar Star (&quot;Islas de Bajamar,&quot; meaning &quot;low-tide islands&quot; in Spanish, was the original name of the Bahamas because many of them are only easily seen from a ship during low tide).

Although the light from the Bajamar Star is dimmed by 9.6 magnitudes (almost 10,000 times) by the dark cloud L935, it is faintly visible at optical wavelengths, at magnitude 13.2. If we saw this star undimmed, it would shine at magnitude 3.6, almost as bright as Albireo, the star marking the swan&#x27;s head.

<text>The National Statuary Hall is a chamber in the United States Capitol devoted to sculptures of prominent Americans. The hall, also known as the Old Hall of the House, is a large, two-story, semicircular room with a second story gallery along the curved perimeter. It is located immediately south of the Rotunda. The meeting place of the U.S. House of Representatives for nearly 50 years (1807–1857), after a few years of disuse it was repurposed as a statuary hall in 1864; this is when the National Statuary Hall Collection was established. By 1933, the collection had outgrown this single room, and a number of statues are placed elsewhere within the Capitol.

==Description==
The Hall is built in the shape of an ancient amphitheater and is one of the earliest examples of Neoclassical architecture in America. While most wall surfaces are painted plaster, the low gallery walls and pilasters are sandstone. Around the room&#x27;s perimeter stand colossal columns of variegated breccia marble quarried along the Potomac River. The Corinthian capitals of white marble were carved in Carrara, Italy. A lantern in the fireproof cast-steel ceiling admits natural light into the Hall. The chamber floor is laid with black and white marble tiles; the black marble was purchased specifically for the chamber, while the white marble was scrap material from the Capitol extension project.

Only two of the many statues presently in the room were commissioned for display in the original Hall of the House. &#x27;s neoclassical plaster &quot;Liberty and the Eagle&quot; looks out over the Hall from a niche above the colonnade behind what was once the Speaker&#x27;s rostrum. The sandstone relief eagle in the frieze of the entablature below was carved by Giuseppe Valaperta. Above the door leading into the Rotunda is the &quot;Car of History&quot; by Carlo Franzoni. This neoclassical marble sculpture depicts Clio, the Muse of History, riding in the chariot of Time and recording events in the chamber below. The wheel of the chariot contains the chamber clock; the works are by Simon Willard.

==History==
This chamber is the second hall and third meeting place built for the House of Representatives in this location. Prior to this, the House members met in a squat, oval, temporary building known as &quot;the Oven&quot;, which had been hastily erected in 1801. The first permanent Hall, designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe, was completed in 1807; however, it was destroyed when invading British troops burned the Capitol in August 1814 during the War of 1812. The Hall was rebuilt in its present form by Latrobe and his successor, Charles Bulfinch, between 1815 and 1819. The smooth, curved ceiling promoted annoying echoes, making it difficult to conduct business. Various attempts to improve the acoustics, including hanging draperies and reversing the seating arrangement, proved unsuccessful. The only solution to this problem was to build an entirely new Hall, one in which debates could be easily understood. In 1850, a new Hall was authorized, and the House moved into its present chamber in the new House wing in 1857.

Many important events took place in this Chamber while it served as the Hall of the House. It was in this room in 1824 that the Marquis de Lafayette became the first foreign citizen to address Congress. Presidents James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, and Millard Fillmore were inaugurated here. John Quincy Adams, in particular, has long been associated with the Chamber. It was here in 1825 that he was elected president by the House of Representatives, none of the candidates having secured a majority of electoral votes. Following his presidency, Adams served as a Member in the Hall for 17 years. He collapsed at his desk from a stroke on February 21, 1848, and died two days later in the adjoining office, at the time, of the Speaker of the House.

The fate of the vacated Hall remained uncertain for many years, although various proposals were put forth for its use. Perhaps the simplest was that it be converted into additional space for the Library of Congress, which was still housed in the Capitol. More drastic was the suggestion that the entire Hall be dismantled and replaced by two floors of committee rooms. Eventually, the idea of using the chamber as an art gallery was approved, and works intended for the Capitol extensions were put on exhibit; among these was the plaster model for the &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot;, which was later cast in bronze for the Capitol dome. The lack of wall space effectively prevented the hanging of large paintings, but the room seemed well suited to the display of statuary.

In 1864, in accordance with legislation sponsored by Representative Justin Morrill, Congress invited each state to contribute two statues of prominent citizens for permanent display in the room, which was renamed National Statuary Hall. The legislation also provided for the replacement of the chamber&#x27;s floor, which was leveled and covered with the marble tile currently in the Hall. This modification, along with the replacement of the original wooden ceiling (which was painted to simulate three-dimensional coffering) with the present one in the early 20th century, eliminated most of the echoes that earlier plagued the room.

The first statue was placed in 1870. By 1971, all 50 states had contributed at least one statue, and by 1990, all but five states had contributed two statues. Initially all of the state statues were placed in the Hall. As the collection expanded, however, it outgrew the Hall, and in 1933, Congress authorized the display of the statues throughout the building for both aesthetic and structural reasons. Presently, 38 statues are located in National Statuary Hall.

The room was partially restored in 1976 for the bicentennial celebration. At that time, the original fireplaces were uncovered and replicas of early mantels were installed. Reproductions of the chandelier, sconces, and red draperies were created for the restoration project based on &quot;The House of Representatives&quot;, an oil painting by Samuel F.B. Morse done in 1822, which now hangs in the Corcoran Gallery of Art. Bronze markers were placed on the floor to honor the presidents who served in the House of Representatives while it met here.

In 2008, 23 statues were moved from the hall to the new Capitol Visitor Center.

Three people have lain in state in the National Statuary Hall:
* Elijah Cummings (October 24, 2019)
* Ruth Bader Ginsburg (September 25, 2020)
* Don Young (March 29, 2022)

Today, Statuary Hall is one of the most visited rooms in the Capitol. It is visited by hundreds of tourists each day and continues to be used for ceremonial occasions. Special events held in the room include activities honoring foreign dignitaries and every four years Congress hosts a newly inaugurated President of the United States for a luncheon.

<doc id="346226" wikidata="Q844490" url="?curid=346226" title="Wen Wei Po">
<text>Wen Wei Po is a pro-Beijing state-owned newspaper based in Hong Kong. The newspaper was established in Hong Kong on 9 September 1948, 10 years after the launch of its Shanghai counterpart in 1938.

Its head office is located at the Hing Wai Centre () in Aberdeen, Hong Kong.

The paper is owned by Ta Kung Wen Wei Media Group, which is controlled by the liaison office of the Chinese government in Hong Kong. &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; is subsidised by and advocates for the Chinese government. &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; accounts for less than 1 percent of Hong Kong&#x27;s readership, and is mainly read by an audience in mainland China and older Hong Kong readers.

In a 2019 public opinion survey conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; was rated by respondents as the second least credible paid newspaper in Hong Kong.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the parent company of &quot;Wen Wei Pao&quot;, Guangdong Xin Wenhua, to be &quot;Captured Public or State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

== History ==
&quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; was founded in Shanghai in January 1938. The Hong Kong edition was first published on 6 September 1948.

In the 1980s, Xinhua News Agency, which served as the &quot;de facto&quot; Chinese embassy to Hong Kong, reduced its control over &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; to reflect China&#x27;s guarantee of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; after sovereignty over Hong Kong is transferred to China in 1997.

In 1989, &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; published an editorial criticizing the People&#x27;s Liberation Army for their crackdown of protesters in Tiananmen Square. The paper reported what it claimed was a firsthand account from a 20-year-old Qinghua University student, whose identity was kept confidential. This account alleged that soldiers first set up over ten machine guns in front of the Heroes Monument and mass fired into the crowd of students inside Tiananmen square, and mowing them down. The New York Times gave this supposed eyewitness account prominent display on 12 June, a week after the events. However, no evidence has ever confirmed the account or the existence of the supposed witness. According to Jay Mathews writing in the Columbia Journalism Review, the story was not factual—all verified eyewitness accounts say that all students remaining in the square were allowed to leave peacefully—and that instead hundreds of workers and Beijing residents did die that night but &quot;in a different place and different circumstances&quot;, which had included soldiers shooting many on the stretches of Changan Jie, about a mile west of the square, and in scattered confrontations throughout the city, where some soldiers were beaten or burned to death by angry workers. Lee Tze Chung, the president of the newspaper since 1951, was dismissed, and editor-in-chief Kam Yiu-yu went into exile in the United States. Following the dismissals, &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; received financial support from the Chinese government to repair the image of China following the military crackdown in Beijing.

==Content==
=== Editorial position ===
&quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; has been described as pro-China and leftist.

According to &quot;The Challenge of Hong Kong&#x27;s Reintegration With China&quot;, a book written by Ming K. Chan, Wen Wei Po is a &quot;mouthpiece&quot; of the Chinese government.
===Space and military news===
&quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; is known to periodically leak first hand information about the PRC&#x27;s space program and military buildup. Examples of this occurring include the advanced launch date of the Shenzhou 7 mission.

<text>Stamps.com is a brand and the former corporate name of Auctane, an American company that provides Internet-based mailing and shipping services. Until its acquisition by Thoma Bravo, Stamps.com was a public company traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol STMP. The company&#x27;s main offices are located in Austin, Texas.

==History==
Founded in 1996, Stamps.com was created under the name StampMaster by Jim McDermott, Ari Engelberg, and Jeff Green, who at the time were MBA graduate students at UCLA. StampMaster was among the first companies to obtain approval from the United States Postal Service for beta testing and introducing Internet postage to the market. The Postal Service began announcing proposals for digital delivery of postage in 1996.

Stamps.com finished its Series A funding in February 1998 with $1.5 million. Series B funding followed in August 1998 with $4.52 million. It had its last round of private financing in February 1999, generating an additional $30 million from investors including former Postmaster General, Marvin Runyon. The company went public in June of the same year and raised $55 million in its IPO. Less than six months after its IPO, the company had its secondary public offering. In August 1999, the Postal Service granted permission for Stamps.com to sell its service nationally. Stamps.com purchased IShip.com, a company that compared prices of shipping services, for $305 million in stock or eight million shares, in October 1999.

In 2001, Stamps.com named Ken McBride its CEO. The U.S. Postal Service authorized the first market test of PhotoStamps in 2004. In 2005, the company reported $10.4 million in net income. PhotoStamps was re-launched in May 2005 for another year-long test run. The United States Congress amended a law in January 2006 that had prohibited attaching business advertising to postage, effective in May of that year, which cleared the way for businesses to use PhotoStamps. In September 2006, the company launched Photo NetStamps, which combined its previous NetStamps product with PhotoStamps. This combination allowed PhotoStamps to be used with exact postage printed from Stamps.com software. By 2008, Stamps.com had more than 300,000 customers. The company recorded revenues of $38.6 million in 2012.

By 2013, it had approximately 465,000 registered customers. Stamps.com reported $147.3 million in revenue the following year. It acquired Auctane ShipStation, a web-based multi-carrier shipping vendor based in Austin, Texas, in June 2014 for $50 million and up to 768,900 shares of stock. Auctane LLC, which used the trade name ShipStation, was founded in 2011 and creates tools to import orders from shopping cart platforms for order fulfillment. The acquisition made Auctane an independent subsidiary of Stamps.com operated by its existing management team. In October that same year, Stamps.com acquired ShipWorks, a multi-carrier shipping software company that integrates with shopping cart platforms, for $22 million. ShipWorks continued to operate as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of Auctane.

In March 2015, Stamps.com entered into an agreement to acquire Endicia, another internet postage company, from Newell Rubbermaid for approximately $215 million. Endicia&#x27;s products include the &quot;DYMO Stamps&quot; and &quot;PictureItPostage&quot; brands.

On June 20, 2016, Stamps.com announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase ShippingEasy, Inc., an Austin, Texas-based company which offers web-based multi-carrier shipping software that allows online retailers and e-commerce merchants to organize, process, fulfill and ship their orders. Stamps.com agreed to acquire ShippingEasy for $55 million in cash, as well as performance-linked equity awards of 87,000 shares of Stamps.com&#x27;s common stock.

On July 25, 2018, Stamps.com announced another agreement to purchase Metapack Ltd., a London-based company providing delivery management technology to e-commerce retailers and brands. The agreement was made on the price of approx. £175 million in cash. MetaPack will continue to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary led by its current management team with further details of the acquisition to be discussed on August 1, 2018.

On July 9, 2021, Thoma Bravo announced a pending acquisition of Stamps.com at a $330/share price, and a 40-day &quot;go-shop&quot; period for alternative proposals. The acquisition was completed in October of that year, and in December the company changed its corporate name to Auctane, previously the name of its subsidiary that owned ShipStation, ShippingEasy, ShipEngine, and ShipWorks.

==Products==

===Online postage===

Stamps.com allows users to print official United States Postal Service stamps and shipping labels for a monthly subscription fee of $19.99. Stamps.com sends customers a digital scale to weigh letters and packages to ensure the correct amount of postage is applied to the piece of mail. The amount of postage applied is then deducted from the customer&#x27;s Stamps.com account. Customers can print postage on envelopes, regular paper or adhesive labels. The system integrates with external address books applications including Outlook and Act!, small business applications such as Microsoft Word and Intuit&#x27;s QuickBooks, and e-commerce platforms such as eBay, Shopify, Magento, and Amazon.com.

===PhotoStamps===
Stamps.com also offered a product called PhotoStamps that allows customers to upload personal photographs or logos to be printed on real U.S. postage stamps. PhotoStamps were sold as a sheet of 20 postage stamps. The service was discontinued on June 10, 2020 after the USPS discontinued its customized postage program.

==Controversies==
In 2004, the website The Smoking Gun successfully ordered PhotoStamps with controversial images, but Stamps.com updated their policy to prohibit images of world leaders or &quot;any material that is vintage in appearance or depicts images from an older era.&quot; The PhotoStamps program was ended by the USPS in 2020.

Stamps.com settled a $2.5 million consumer protection lawsuit from the State of California in 2015 over free trials that eventually converted into monthly service fees. The press release cited &quot;false and misleading advertising&quot;, which was corroborated by independent tech publishers. Stamps.com maintains that such charges are valid and well-explained.

In 2021, the company agreed to a $100 million settlement in a 2019 class-action lawsuit alleging that the company had misled investors about the strength of their relationship with the USPS.

<text>Edward Lewis &quot;Bob&quot; Bartlett (April 20, 1904 – December 11, 1968), was an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He served as a U.S. Senator. A key fighter for Alaska statehood, Bartlett served as the Secretary of Alaska Territory from 1939 to 1945, in Congress from 1945 to 1959 as a Delegate, and from 1959 until his death in 1968 as a U.S. senator. He was opposed to U.S. involvement in Vietnam, along with his fellow Senator Ernest Gruening, and also worked to warn people about the dangers of radiation. Many acts bear his name, including a major law known as the Bartlett Act, mandating handicap access in all federally-funded buildings.

In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him Secretary of the Alaska Territory, serving under Governors John Weir Troy and Ernest Gruening. In 1945, following the retirement of Anthony Dimond, Bartlett was elected as the delegate from Alaska to the 79th and the six succeeding Congresses, with the backing of Dimond. It was in this role that his greatest work on Alaskan statehood was completed, such as the introduction of the Alaska Statehood Act to the House, where he was key in shepherding its passage. Bartlett labored constantly for statehood, being a member of the Alaska Statehood Committee.

Upon Alaska&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1959, he became the senior inaugural U.S. senator from Alaska and served until his death in 1968.

==Early life==

Bartlett was born in Seattle, Washington, as Edward Lewis Bartlett, to Edward C. and Ida Florence (&quot;née&quot; Doverspike) Bartlett. Bartlett&#x27;s elder sister, Doris, insisted on calling the young Bartlett &#x27;Bob&#x27;, which became a name that stuck for life. After attending the University of Washington from 1922 to 1924, Bartlett graduated from the University of Alaska in 1925.

==Career==

Shortly after his graduation, Bartlett began his career in politics. A reporter for the &quot;Fairbanks Daily News&quot; from 1924 until 1933, he accepted the position of secretary to Delegate Anthony Dimond of Alaska, serving in that role for a year. Three years later, he became the chairman of the Unemployment Compensation Commission of Alaska, serving from 1937 to 1939.

Bartlett&#x27;s father died in 1935, so he returned to Fairbanks to run his family&#x27;s mining business. However, Bartlett wasn&#x27;t a big fan of mining and looked back to the political arena in 1938.

On January 30, 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him secretary of the Alaska Territory, serving under Governors John Weir Troy in 1939 and Ernest Gruening from 1939 to 1944. Bartlett served as acting Governor multiple times, such as during the opening of the Alaska-Canada Highway.

In 1945, following the retirement of Anthony Dimond, Bartlett was elected as the delegate from Alaska to the 79th and the six succeeding Congresses, with the backing of Dimond. It was in this capacity that his greatest work on Alaskan statehood was completed, such as the introduction of the Alaska Statehood Act to the House. Continuing his civic service, he was president of the Alaska Tuberculosis Association and served as a member of the Alaska War Council, from 1942 to 1944.

Bartlett labored constantly for statehood, being a member of the Alaska Statehood Committee. Bartlett, as delegate, was the one who introduced the Alaska Statehood Act into Congress, being key in shepherding its passage.

Upon Alaska&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1959, Bartlett became the senior inaugural U.S. senator from Alaska, along with junior Senator Ernest Gruening, with their senior-junior status determined by a coin flip. Bartlett served in this role until his death in office in 1968. He was succeeded by State Representative Ted Stevens, appointed by Governor Hickel, who had lost the Republican primary for Alaska&#x27;s other Senate seat that year to former Anchorage Mayor Elmer Rasmuson. Stevens had also previously been the 1962 Republican nominee.

Bartlett possessed the reputation of a quiet man of achievement. The Library of Congress estimates that he had more bills passed into law than any other member in congressional history. Before statehood, he was writing legislation (sponsored by other congressional representatives), such as the Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act of 1956. Some of his bills included the Radiation Safety Bill and the Bartlett Act, requiring all federally funded buildings to be accessible to disabled people.

=== Career as a U.S. senator ===

Bartlett was elected as one of Alaska&#x27;s inaugural Senators along with former Territorial Governor Ernest Gruening in 1958. On account of his service as a Delegate, Bartlett was nominated as the senior U.S. senator, a decision that upset Gruening, who challenged this; it led to a coinflip. Bartlett won the coinflip, which ended the dispute. A rivalry with Gruening made Bartlett nickname his colleague &#x27;Junior&#x27; for the rest of his life.

A member of Bartlett&#x27;s staff, David Price, later became a U.S. Representative from North Carolina.

In the 1968 Senate race, Bartlett&#x27;s long-time colleague Ernest Gruening was defeated in the Democratic primary by Mike Gravel, former speaker of the Alaska House of Representatives. In the general election, Gruening and his supporters launched a write-in campaign against Gravel and the Republican nominee, former Anchorage mayor Elmer Rasumson, who had defeated 1962 nominee Ted Stevens in their primary. Gruening fully expected Bartlett&#x27;s endorsement in the race, as they had worked together for nearly three decades. But in an official statement, Bartlett stated &quot;On August 27th, Alaskans in the primary election chose Mike Gravel as Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate over Ernest Gruening. The voters spoke.&quot; Bartlett went on to say, &quot;I have put personal considerations aside in this decision. The time comes when a man must speak out. I speak out now! I support the Democratic majority. I support Mike Gravel.&quot; Gruening was devastated, and was mystified why Bartlett had endorsed Gravel over him.

=== 1964 Alaska earthquake ===
Following the 1964 Alaska earthquake, Bartlett was part of the inspection team, and he contributed to efforts to rebuild Anchorage, along with Governor Bill Egan, Representative Ralph Rivers and Senator Gruening. Bartlett &amp; Gruening came into Alaska on Air Force One, thanks to Edward McDermott, Director of the Office of Emergency Planning. President Johnson declared Alaska a &#x27;major disaster area&#x27;. Bartlett and Gruening reported the damage back to Johnson, where he sent federal aid.

=== Fight for Alaskan Statehood===
Bartlett first introduced the Alaska Statehood Act in 1947, although the bill was defeated.

Bartlett re-introduced the Alaska Statehood Act in 1950, with the backing of President Harry Truman, although, after passing the House of Representatives by a 40-vote margin, it was killed in committee in the Senate. Bartlett remained unfazed, and he called on Alaskans to join his fight for statehood. Alaskans responded with the 1956 constitutional convention, which elected Shadow U.S. Senators William A. Egan and Ernest Gruening, as well as Shadow U.S. Representative Ralph Rivers, all sworn in on October 6, 1956. The convention also created a state constitution for Alaska. The shadow Congressmen&#x27;s main goal was to request or demand Alaskan statehood from the U.S. Congress. The Convention drew national attention to the fight for Alaskan Statehood. With the pressure from the convention and Bartlett, of whom members of Congress were very fond, congressmen and other federal politicians rapidly switched their opinions, most notably Sam Rayburn, the powerful Speaker of the House, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower, all of whom had been courted by Bartlett, after previous opposition.

Bartlett was assisted by numerous Alaskans, such as Territorial Governor Mike Stepovich, who was present at the House vote, former Territorial Governor Ernest Gruening, and senior U.S. Department of the Interior official Ted Stevens, who was (illegally) using the Interior&#x27;s offices to lobby for statehood. After talking to Stevens in 1958, Bartlett remarked in a letter to a friend &quot;At a guess, I should say that many taxpayers&#x27; dollars are used for telephone calls to the Interior Department from Alaska and vice versa on matters more political than executive.&quot;

In 1958, the bill for Alaska Statehood was reintroduced, backed by Eisenhower, Johnson, and Rayburn. The main opponents of the bill were Republicans and Southern Democrats. Republicans feared that Alaska, a Democratic-leaning state, would elect Democrats to Congress. Southern Democrats feared that Alaska, a state with a high native population and that had passed one of the first laws against discrimination, would elect pro-civil rights Senators.

The bill would pass the House in April 1958, and defeat competition from powerful Virginia Representative and Chair of the House Rules Committee, Howard W. Smith, as well as Washington Representative Thomas Pelly. Bartlett used a powerful procedure, which had been omitted shortly after 1912 because Congress did not plan to add any more states after Arizona. However, the Library of Congress found that the procedure had never been formally abolished. The procedure would have allowed every single Representative to speak on the floor for an hour. Facing the possibility of more than 400 hours of debate, Smith and the other Representatives who were in opposition all backed down. Bartlett was key in shepherding the bill through the Senate, where it passed on June 30, 1958, by a vote of 64–20. Following this, the chamber broke into applause. Bartlett missed this, as he held the promise that he would call back home to Alaska if the bill passed. Bartlett was in his office, calling Alaskans, for most of the night.

President Eisenhower would sign the bill on July 7, 1958, and after the November 25th 1958 elections, in which nearly 80% of eligible Alaskans voted, Bartlett would be elected U.S. Senator, defeating R.E. Robertson. Bartlett would be inaugurated on January 3, 1959, the day that Alaska became a state. Bartlett&#x27;s part in the Alaska Statehood Act was large, with Sam Rayburn summing up his change in opinion with: &quot;Two words. Bob Bartlett.&quot;

== Personal life ==
=== Death ===
Bartlett was a heavy smoker throughout his life, and his health started to fail in the months leading up to his death, with Bartlett receiving treatment for heart ailments. His health failures, despite Bartlett&#x27;s good spirits, became obvious in campaign ads for Gravel. Bartlett had gone on a vacation to the Caribbean, though couldn&#x27;t fight off the pain and illness. Eventually, Bartlett &amp; his family decided to get a coronary bypass surgery performed. After the surgery, Bartlett went into cardiac arrest multiple times, but he eventually started to slowly improve, before beginning to decline again. On December 11, 1968, at the age of 64, Bartlett died following the surgery at Cleveland Clinic Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.

Bartlett died on the same day that Governor Walter Hickel was announced as President-elect Richard Nixon&#x27;s nominee for U.S. Secretary of the Interior. However, the passing of a new law in the Alaska State Legislature let Hickel appoint a Senator from either political party. Bartlett was aware of that, and before the surgery, he left a notice to his physician reading, &quot;Don&#x27;t let your scalpel slip, because the law has changed, and the current Governor, Hickel, will appoint a Republican in my place.&quot; That made Hickel appoint the Republican nominee for the 1962 U.S. Senate race, Alaskan statehood activist &amp; former senior executive official Ted Stevens to the seat. Stevens would serve for the following 40 years, serving as President pro tempore.

Bartlett&#x27;s funeral was held on December 14. He was buried in Northern Lights Memorial Park, Fairbanks, Alaska. Bartlett staffer and state senator Joe Josephson reported that &quot;In some funerals, you feel like people are there out of duty, or to show the flag, however, with Bartlett, it really felt like a friend was lost.&quot;

===Family===
On August 14, 1930, Bartlett married his long-time companion &amp; childhood friend, Vide Gaustad, the daughter of local newspaperman &amp; miner O.P. Gaustad, who was politically active. Their marriage was witnessed by Territorial Senator (and later territorial delegate to the U.S. House) Anthony Dimond, who helped Bartlett further his political career.

Bartlett&#x27;s daughter, Doris Ann Bartlett, was a literature teacher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. She also served as the UAF&#x27;s librarian for the 1956 Alaska Constitutional Convention. She was born February 7, 1934, and she died in 2015.

Bartlett had another daughter, Susie Bernice Bartlett, on December 9, 1940.

=== Legacy ===

On March 27, 1971, the state of Alaska commissioned Felix de Weldon to create a bronze statue of Bartlett which resides in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. The unveiling ceremony was opened by Alaska&#x27;s senior U.S. Senator &amp; Bartlett&#x27;s successor, Ted Stevens. U.S. Senator from Washington Warren Magnuson, Rev. Edward L.R. Elson, U.S. Senator Mike Gravel, U.S. Representative Nick Begich, and Lieutenant Governor Red Boucher all spoke at the unveiling. Magnuson, in tribute, referred to Bartlett as Alaska&#x27;s &quot;Founding Father&quot;, while Rev. Elson praised Bartlett&#x27;s &quot;high vision, lofty idealism, prodigious energy and sacrificial devotion.&quot;, as well as lauding his &quot;enduring statesmanship&quot;, and his many legislative &amp; executive achievements.

A substantial number of buildings, place names and more have been named after Bartlett in Alaska over the years. The most notable of these include Bartlett Regional Hospital (originally St. Ann&#x27;s Hospital, and known for a time as Bartlett Memorial Hospital), the hospital serving Juneau, Alaska, as well as Bartlett High School in Anchorage and Bartlett Hall at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

<text>The national flag of Montenegro () has a red field with gold border and the coat of arms of Montenegro in its center. It was officially adopted on 13 July 2004, when the then Republic of Montenegro was a constituent of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, and its precise specification was standardized on 16 September 2004. The flag was retained after Montenegrin independence from Serbia in 2006, and mandated by Article 4 of the Constitution of Montenegro adopted in 2007.

==Description==
The flag of Montenegro is red, with the coat of arms in the middle, and golden borders. The ratio of the flag is 1:2. The coat of arms takes up of the flag&#x27;s height. The middle point of the coat of arms matches the middle point of the flag. The width of the border is of the flag&#x27;s height. Two versions of the Montenegrin flag are in use, horizontal, mostly used outdoors; and vertical, mostly used indoors.

==Use of flag==
The flag is permanently hoisted on:
* the Parliament of Montenegro;
* buildings which are official premises of the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, the Chairman of the High Court, the Chairman of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme State Attorney and the Human Rights Ombudsman;
* the residence of the President of Montenegro.

The flag is also hoisted on:
* the statehood day of Montenegro and in days of other state holidays of Montenegro, on buildings in which are seated state bodies and other bodies of government
* buildings of the representations of Montenegro abroad;
* aircraft, ships and other vessels according to special regulations;
* voting sites during elections and referendums;
* mourning days determined by the Government, half-masted.

The flag may also be hoisted during international meetings, political, scientific, cultural, artistic, sporting and other manifestations in which Montenegro is represented, according to the rules of such events.

According to international tradition, when the flag is hoisted together with one or more flags of other states or international organizations on Montenegrin soil, the flag takes the place of honour.
The place of honour is considered the center of a circle, the top of a semicircle, the first place in a row, column or a group of flags, the central position between the flags and the left side as seen from the front from the flags of other states or international organizations.

The flag is hoisted, lowered and carried with the usual honors (standing up, saluting etc.) The flag can not be hoisted so as to touch the ground, nor should be used as a table cloth, curtain or similar.

==Historical==

The historical war flags were the krstaš-barjak, plain flags with crosses in the center.

*The Montenegrin war flag used in the Battle of Vučji Do (1876) was red with a white cross pattée in the center and a white border. This flag was used as the military stag during the Montenegrin-Ottoman wars. The same flag was used in Cetinje in 1878, upon the recognition of independence by the Ottoman Empire at San Stefano.
*According to the 1905 constitution, the national flag was a tricolour of red-bluish-white, which were the colours of the Montenegrin folk costume.

Flags as the state symbols were introduced only in the time of Petar II Petrović-Njegoš. Before him, the principal Montenegrin flag had been the alaj-barjak (regimental colors) with a single symbol on it – the cross (&quot;krst&quot;). The first written description of a Montenegrin flag dates from the time of Šćepan Mali: it was white, with a red frame and a golden cross on top of the spear. The next comes from 1838: pale-yellow with the small red cross, and in 1876 the flag was described as red with a white cross. At the time of Prince Danilo, the cross on the alaj-barjak was replaced by the two-headed eagle with the initials DI (Danilo I) on its breast, with the lion passant underneath. Prince/King Nikola used many different flags in his time. The first of the variants was the same as Danilo&#x27;s, differing only in the initials – NI (Nikola I). Around 1910, two new variants appeared: one tricolor (red, blue and white) with the two-headed eagle bearing the initials &quot;NI&quot; on its breast and the lion passant on the sinister, the other with the two-headed eagle above the initials &quot;NI&quot;.

In late 1946 a new flag was adopted for the People&#x27;s Republic of Montenegro as a constituent republic of the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia. The flags of several Yugoslav Republics used their traditional tricolors, with the monarchic coat of arms replaced by the red star of Communism. The replacement left the flags of SR Serbia and SR Montenegro identical. 

After the 1991–1992 breakup of SFR Yugoslavia, a noncommunist &quot;rump&quot; Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (also known as Serbia and Montenegro) was formed by the Republic of Serbia and Republic of Montenegro. In 1993 the latter adopted as its flag a horizontal tricolor of red, light blue and white, with the size ratio of 1:3, making it the longest national flag in the world. 

Increased Montenegrin nationalism saw FR Yugoslavia replaced in 2003 by the looser State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, which failed to prevent a 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum precipitating the dissolution of the union. During this period, in 2004 the Assembly of the Republic of Montenegro passed the &quot;Law on State Symbols and the Day of the Statehood of Montenegro&quot; including a new, distinctive flag, based on an old royal banner. It was promulgated in the official gazette on 12 July 2004 and came into force the following day, which was proclaimed Statehood Day. The July law gave the government 60 days to produce a comprehensive specification; in fact this was finalized on 16 September 2004 and published the next day. In the interim, some flag manufacturers had interpreted the July law&#x27;s &quot;gold border&quot; as a fringe rather than a bordure; the latter interpretation was confirmed by the September specification. On the day of proclaiming independence flag of 2004 became Montenegro&#x27;s national flag. 

The flag is mandated by Article 4 of the Constitution of Montenegro adopted in 2007. The provisions relating to the flag in the 2004 Law on State Symbols were affected by subsequent amendments in 2011 and 2019. An updated flag protocol was published in 2020.

<text>The Habima Theatre ( &quot;Te&#x27;atron HaBima&quot;, lit. &quot;The Stage Theatre&quot;) is the national theatre of Israel and one of the first Hebrew language theatres. It is located in Habima Square in the center of Tel Aviv.

==History==


Habima was founded as an amateur troup by Nahum Lazarevich Tsemakh (Hebrew: Naḥum Tsemaḥ; 1887–1939) in Białystok (then in Grodno Governorate, Russian Empire) in 1912. Menahem Gnessin was one of its cofounders and early actors. Because its performances were in Hebrew, invoked the Jewish folk tradition, and dealt with issues of the Jewish people, soon it was banned by Russian authorities, and the theatre troupe was forced to become a travelling one. Beginning in 1918, the theatre operated under the auspices of the Moscow Art Theatre, which some consider its actual beginning. It encountered difficulties under the Soviet government as well, after the Russian Revolution. Konstantin Stanislavsky arranged for the mainly Jewish Polish actors to be trained by Yevgeny Vakhtangov. The People&#x27;s Commissar for Nationalities Affairs, Joseph Stalin, also authorized the theatre&#x27;s creation. However, the Yevsektsiya attempted to use its influence to cut off state funds to Habima, branding it counter-revolutionary.

===International tour===
In 1926, the theatre left the Soviet Union to tour abroad, in countries including Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States. Their productions met with great success. In 1927, the company split up, with Zemach and some of the actors choosing to stay in the U.S.

===Lodz Impact===
The theatre staff visited the city of Lodz, and the pre-war photographer and artist Mendel Grossman, photographed the actors and actresses from the wings of the stage. His life was changed as a result of the visit of the theatre.

===Establishment in Palestine===
Other members of the theatre took the company to Mandate Palestine in 1928. In the 1928–29 season there, the Habima Players presented two plays, both under the direction of Aleksei Dikiy, from the Moscow Art Theatre. The first production, &quot;Ha-otsar&quot; (The Treasure), a translation of Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s Yiddish play &quot;Der Oytser&quot;, premiered on December 29, 1928. The second production, which premiered on May 23, 1929, in Tel Aviv, was &quot;Keter David&quot; (David&#x27;s Crown), an adaptation by Hebrew writer Isaac Lamdan of &quot;The Hair of Absalom&quot; (&quot;Los cabellos de Absalón&quot;), by the 17th-century Spanish dramatist Calderón.

In 1930 the company traveled to Berlin, Germany, where it produced Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, directed by Michael Chekhov, and Karl Gutzkow&#x27;s &quot;Uriel Acosta&quot;, under the direction of Alexander Granovski.

The company finally settled in Palestine in 1931. In 1945, it built a theatre in Tel Aviv, which it occupied before completion.
===National Theatre of Israel===
Habima has been officially considered the national theatre of Israel since 1958, the year in which it received the Israel Prize for theatre. This was the first year in which the Prize was awarded to an organization. In the 21st century, Habima employs 80 actors, and another 120 staff members work at the complex.

==Restoration== 

In January 2012, the theatre reopened after four and a half years of renovations. Architect Ram Karmi was commissioned to redesign the historic building. More than NIS 100 million was invested in the makeover, which has added 500 square meters of floor space and three new rehearsal rooms. The building&#x27;s four auditoriums were completely rebuilt. Each is a different size and color: Rovina is blue and seats 930 people; Meskin is lavender and seats 320; Bertonov (also known as Bamartef) is green and seats 220; and Habima 4 (formerly known as Heineken) is wood panelled and seats 170.

<doc id="346245" wikidata="Q1196269" url="?curid=346245" title="Renesas Electronics">
<text>is a Japanese semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, initially incorporated in 2002 as Renesas Technology, the consolidated entity of the semiconductor units of Hitachi and Mitsubishi excluding their dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) businesses, to which NEC Electronics merged in 2010, resulting in a minor change in the corporate name and logo to as it is now.

In the 2000s to early 2010s, Renesas had been one of the six largest semiconductor companies in the world. As of 2022, it is the world&#x27;s third-largest automotive semiconductor company and the largest microcontroller supplier. The company also has presences in the markets of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits, memory devices, and SoCs.

The brand Renesas is a contraction of &quot;Renaissance Semiconductor for Advanced Solutions&quot;.

== History ==

Renesas Electronics started operation in April 2010, through the integration of NEC Electronics, established in November 2002 as a spin-off of the semiconductor operations of NEC with the exception of the DRAM business, and Renesas Technology established on April 1, 2003, the non-DRAM chip joint venture of Hitachi and Mitsubishi, with their ownership percentage of 55 and 45 in order. The DRAM businesses of the three had become part of Elpida Memory, which went bankrupt in 2012 before being acquired by Micron Technology.

A basic agreement to merge was reached by April 2010 and materialized on the first day, forming the fourth largest semiconductor company by revenue according to an estimation from iSuppli.

In December 2010, Renesas Mobile Corporation (RMC) was created by integrating the Mobile Multimedia Business Unit of Renesas with the acquired Nokia Wireless Modem Business Unit.

In 2011, Renesas Electronics was adversely affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and flooding in Thailand. In 2012, the company, which had about 50 thousand employees of manufacturing, design and sales operations in about 20 countries in 2011, decided to restructure its business, including the sale and consolidation of its Japanese domestic plants, to become profitable. In December 2012, INCJ, a Japanese public-private fund, and several key clients decided to invest in the company. Through the investment, Renesas aimed to secure 150 billion yen as fresh capital by September 2013 and make use of it for investment in development of the microcontroller and analog and power chips for automotive and industrial uses, plant improvements, and corporate acquisitions.

In January 2013, Renesas transferred some of its back-end plants to J-Devices.

In September 2013, Broadcom acquired most of Renesas Mobile Communication.

With the allotment of third-party shares to the nine investors completed in September 2013, INCJ became the largest shareholder in the company. Renesas announced its new business direction and issued its corporate presentation titled &quot;Reforming Renesas” in October 2013.

In the fiscal year ended in March 2014, Renesas recorded its first ever net profit since it started operation as Renesas Electronics Corporation in 2010.

In July 2014, the subsidiary Renesas Mobile Communication was consolidated, after the company had decided to withdraw from the 4G wireless business.

In September 2014, the sale of the display driver IC unit of Renesas to Synaptics was completed.

In September 2016, Renesas announced that it would acquire Intersil for $3.2 billion. In February 2017, Renesas completed the acquisition.

In April 2017, Renesas unveiled a self-driving concept car at a global developer conference, stating that it will start delivering a new line of products for self-driving cars in December 2017, as it takes on global giants such as Intel. The new technology acts as an onboard nerve center, coordinating and controlling vehicle functions.

In September 2018, Renesas announced that it has agreed to buy Integrated Device Technology for $6.7 billion. The acquisition was completed in March 2019.

In 2020, Renesas announced its plans to wind down its production of diodes and the compound device.

In February 2021, Renesas announced that it has agreed to buy Dialog Semiconductor for $5.9 billion. The acquisition was completed in September 2021.

In March 2021, a fire at the Naka Factory owned by a subsidiary of Renesas caused significant damage to equipment. On April 17, 2022, Renesas restarted its production at the Naka Factory.

In August 2021, Renesas completed the acquisition of Dialog Semiconductor Plc.

In December 2021, Renesas also completed the acquisition of Celeno Communications.

In May 2022 Renesas announced the re-opening of its &quot;Kofu&quot; Fab which will utilize the 300mm geometry for the fabrication of power semiconductors. The facility is scheduled to be online in 2024.

In July 2022, Renesas completed the acquisition of Reality Analytics, Inc., adding additional resources for machine learning and artificial intelligence.

In October 2022, Renesas completed the acquisition of Steradian Semiconductors Private Limited, a fabless semiconductor company.

In September 2022, Renesas signed a strategic partnership with VinFast from Vietnam to announce expanding agreement of automotive technology development of electric vehicles (EVs) and delivery of system components.

In December 2022, Renesas won the 2022 “Outstanding Asia-Pacific Semiconductor Company Award” by Global Semiconductor Alliance.

=== Microcontrollers ===

==== The RL78 MCU family ====
RL78 is the family name for a range of 16-bit microcontrollers. These were the first new MCU to emerge from the new Renesas Electronics company after the merger of NEC Electronics and Renesas Technology. These Microcontrollers incorporate the core features of the NEC 78K0R (150 nm MF2 flash process) and many familiar peripherals from legacy Renesas R8C microcontrollers. The RL78 core variants include the S1, S2, and S3 type cores which evolved from the NEC 78K0R core. The basic S1 core support 74 instructions, the S2 core adds register banking and supports 75 instructions, while the S3 core adds an on-chip multiplier / divider / multiple-accumulate and supports 81 instructions.

The RL78 was developed to address extremely low power but highly integrated microcontroller applications, to this end the core offered a novel low power mode of operation called “snooze mode” where the ADC or serial interface can be programmed to meet specific conditions to wake the device from the extreme low power STOP mode of 0.52uA.

==== The RX MCU family ====
The RX, an acronym for Renesas Xtreme, is the family name for a range of 32-bit microcontrollers developed by Renesas, as opposed to the H family and the MC family, launched by Hitachi and Mitsubishi respectively.

The RX family was launched in 2009 by Renesas Technology with the first product range designated the RX600 series and targeting applications such as metering, motor control, human–machine interfaces (HMI), networking, and industrial automation. Since 2009 this MCU family range has been enlarged with a smaller variant the RX200 series and also through enhanced performance versions.

==== The RA MCU family ====
The RA, an acronym for Renesas Advanced, is the family name for a range of 32-bit microcontrollers with Arm Cortex processor cores. The RA family&#x27;s key features are the stronger embedded security, high-performance, and CoreMark ultra-low power operation. It also has a comprehensive partner ecosystem and Flexible Software Package for the users.
=== Microprocessors ===

==== The RZ Arm-based 32 &amp; 64-bit family ====
The Renesas RZ family is a high-end 32 &amp; 64 bit microprocessors that is designed for the implementations of high resolution human machine interface (HMI), embedded vision, real-time control, and industrial Ethernet connectivity. It supports 6 protocols: PROFINET RT/IRT, EtherNET/IP, POWERLINK, Modbus/TCP, EtherCAT, TSN, and Sercos III.

The family includes, RZ/A and RZ/G for HMI, RZ/T for high-speed real-time control, and RZ/N for the network.
==Corporate affairs==
The largest stockholders and their ownership ratio of Renesas are as follows as of June 30, 2022.
At the beginning of June 2022, Renesas announced its completion of an approx. 200 billion yen worth buyback of its shares.

At the end of September 2013, Renesas issued new shares through third-party allotment resulting in INCJ becoming the new largest shareholder and non-parental controlling shareholder.

In early May 2012, NEC transferred part of its stake in Renesas to its employee pension trust. As a result, the NEC pension fund held 32.4 percent of Renesas while NEC had 3.0 percent.

=== Corporate responsibility ===
In March 2008, Renesas Electronics signed the UN Global Compact.

In August 2024, the companies ESG risk rating was low at just 17.5%.

<text>Nordhausen is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the north of Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise): Harz and Mansfeld-Südharz in Saxony-Anhalt; Kyffhäuserkreis and Eichsfeld in Thuringia; and Göttingen and Goslar in Lower Saxony.

==History==
The district was created in 1815, when the Prussian province of Saxony was created. The area of Lohra-Clettenberg (the former dukedom County Hohnstein) and the previously independent imperial city of Nordhausen were then administered together. In 1882-3 Nordhausen left the district, which led to its renaming as the &quot;Kreis Grafschaft Hohenstein&quot; (district county of Hohenstein) in 1888. After World War II the name reverted to &quot;Landkreis Nordhausen&quot;, and in 1950 the city of Nordhausen was reincorporated into the district. In the administrative reform of 1952 several municipalities changed districts: a number were transferred from the district of Sangerhausen to that of Nordhausen, while others were transferred from Nordhausen to the districts of Worbis, Wernigerode, Sondershausen, and Sangerhausen.
==Geography==
The district is located in the southern foothills of the Harz mountains. The highest point is the &quot;Große Ehrenberg&quot;, with an elevation of 635.3m above sea level. The main river in the district is the Zorge. To the south lie the Dün, Hainleite, and Windleite ranges of hills.

==Coat of arms==
The checkered red-silver part of the coat of arms is derived from the coat of arms of the County of Hohenstein, the historical territory to which the district belonged. The broken tree trunk symbolizes the destruction of the city of Nordhausen during World War II, while the new branch growing into the golden area stands for the city&#x27;s reconstruction and its bright new future.

<doc id="346261" wikidata="Q59174" url="?curid=346261" title="Capernaum">
<text>Capernaum ( ; ; ) was a fishing village established during the time of the Hasmoneans, located on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. It had a population of about 1,500 in the 1st century AD. Archaeological excavations have revealed two ancient synagogues built one over the other. A house turned into a church by the Byzantines is held by Christian tradition to have been the home of Saint Peter.
The village was inhabited continuously from the 2nd century BC to the 11th century AD, when it was abandoned sometime before the First Crusade. This includes the re-establishment of the village northeast of the earlier location in c. 700, during the Early Islamic period.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Kfar Naḥum&quot;, the original name of the town, means &quot;village of comfort&quot; in Hebrew, and apparently there is no connection with the prophet named Nahum. In the writings of Josephus, the name is rendered in Koine Greek as (&quot;Kapharnaoúm&quot;) and (&quot;Kepharnōkón&quot;); the New Testament uses &quot;Kapharnaoúm&quot; in some manuscripts, and (&quot;Kapernaoúm&quot;) in others. In the Midrash Rabba (Ecclesiastes Rabba 7:47) the name appears in its Hebrew form, &quot;Kǝfar Naḥūm&quot; (). In Arabic, it is called &quot;Talḥūm&quot;, and it is assumed that this refers to the ruin (&quot;tall&quot;) of &quot;Ḥūm&quot; (perhaps an abbreviated form of &quot;Nāḥūm&quot;).

The rare English word &quot;capharnaum&quot; means &quot;a place with a disorderly accumulation of objects&quot; and is derived from the town&#x27;s name.

==New Testament==
Capernaum is cited in all four gospels (, , , ) where it was reported to have been the hometown of the tax collector Matthew and located not far from Bethsaida, the hometown of the apostles Simon Peter, Andrew, James and John. Jesus spent time teaching and healing there. On a Sabbath day, Jesus taught in the synagogue in Capernaum and healed a man who was possessed by an unclean spirit ( and ). This story is notable as the only one that is common to the gospels of Mark and Luke but not contained in the Gospel of Matthew. Afterward, Jesus healed Simon Peter&#x27;s mother-in-law of a fever (). According to and , this is also the place where Jesus healed the servant of a Roman centurion who had asked for his help. Capernaum is the location of the healing of the paralytic lowered by friends through the roof to reach Jesus, as described in and .

In the town is referred to only as &quot;his own city&quot;, and the narrative in does not mention the paralytic being lowered through the roof. Most traditional biblical commentators (e.g. Bengel, Benson and the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary) assume that in &quot;his own city&quot; means Capernaum, because of the details that are common to the three Synoptic Gospels.

According to the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus selected this town as the center of his public ministry in Galilee after he left the small mountainous hamlet of Nazareth (). He formally cursed Capernaum, along with Bethsaida and Chorazin, saying &quot;you will be thrown down to Hades!&quot; () because of their lack of faith in him as the Messiah.

==History==
Archaeological evidence demonstrates that the town was established in the 2nd century BC during the Hasmonean period, when several fishing villages sprung up around the lake. The site had no defensive wall and extended along the northwestern shore of the lake. The cemetery zone is found north of the synagogue, which places it beyond the inhabited area of the town. The historic site of Capernaum is from Tabgha, an area which appears to have been used for agricultural purposes, judging by the many oil and grain mills which were discovered in the excavation. Fishing was a major source of income; the remains of an ancient harbor were found to the west of the modern one built by the Franciscans.

No sources have been found for the belief that Capernaum was involved in the bloody Jewish revolts against the Romans, the First Jewish–Roman War (AD 66–73) or Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt (132–135), although there is reason to believe that Josephus, one of the Jewish generals during the earlier revolt, was taken to Capernaum (which he called , &quot;Kepharnōkón&quot;) after a fall from his horse in nearby Bethsaida. Josephus refers to Capernaum as a fertile spring (Wars – Book III, 10, 8). 

As early as AD 530, Capernaum was mentioned in the writings of Theodosius the archdeacon who said that it was situated, as one goes northward from Tiberias, two miles from Tabgha (Heptapegon) and six miles short of Bethsaida along the same route.

The town was abandoned in the 11th century. Monastery of the Holy Apostles, a Greek Orthodox church and monastery, was built there in 1931.

==Archaeology==
===Discovery and excavation===
In 1838, American explorer Edward Robinson discovered ruins which he identified as those of a synagogue, but he did not relate this to ancient Capernaum. In 1866, Charles William Wilson identified the location (then known as Tel Hum) as Capernaum. In 1894, Franciscan Friar Giuseppe Baldi of Naples, the Custodian of the Holy Land, was able to purchase a good part of the land around the ruins. Additional land on the eastern portion of the site became the property of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem.

In 1905, Germans Heinrich Kohl and Carl Watzinger began a study of Galilean synagogues. These were continued by the Franciscan Fathers Vendelin von Benden (1905–1915) and Gaudenzio Orfali (1921–1926). The excavations resulted in the discovery of two public buildings, the synagogue (which was partially restored by Orfali) and an octagonal church. 

In 1968, excavation of the western portion of the site—the portion owned by the Franciscans—was resumed by Virgilio Corbo and Stanislao Loffreda. During this phase, the major discovery was that of a 1st-century house which is believed by Christians to be the home of Saint Peter. These excavations have been ongoing, with some publication as recently as 2003. The excavations revealed that the site was established at the beginning of the Hasmonean period, roughly in the 2nd century BC, and abandoned in the 11th century.

The eastern half of the site, which is owned by the Orthodox Monastery of the Holy Apostles, centered on the red-domed Church of the Holy Apostles, was surveyed and partially excavated under the direction of Vassilios Tzaferis. This section has uncovered the village from the Byzantine and Early Arab periods. Features include a pool apparently used for the processing of fish, and a hoard of gold coins.
===General description===
On both sides of an ample north–south main street arose small districts bordered by small cross-sectional streets and no-exit side-streets. The walls were constructed with coarse basalt blocks and reinforced with stone and mud, but the stones (except for the thresholds) were not dressed, and mortar was not used.

The most extensive part of the typical house was the courtyard, where there was a circular furnace made of refractory earth, as well as grain mills and a set of stone stairs that led to the roof. The floors of the houses were cobbled. Around the open courtyard, modest cells were arranged which received light through a series of openings or low windows. Given the coarse construction of the walls, there was rarely a second story to a typical home, and the roof would have been constructed of light wooden beams and thatch mixed with mud. This, along with the discovery of stairs to the roof, recalls the story of the Healing of the Paralytic from : &quot;And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay&quot;.

A study of the district located between the synagogue and the octagonal church showed that several extended families clustered together, communally using the same courtyards and doorless internal passages. The houses had no hygienic facilities or drainage; the rooms were narrow. Most objects found were made of clay: pots, plates, amphoras, and lamps. Fish hooks, weights for fish nets, striker pins, weaving bobbins, and basalt mills for milling grain and pressing olives were also found.

As of the 4th century, the houses were constructed with good quality mortar and fine ceramics. This was about the time that the synagogue now visible was built. Differences in social class were not noticeable. Buildings constructed at the founding of the town continued to be in use until the time of the town&#x27;s abandonment.

==Synagogue==

According to Luke&#x27;s Gospel, the Capernaum synagogue at the time of Jesus&#x27; ministry had been built or funded by a Roman centurion based there. The ruins of a later building, among the oldest synagogues in the world, were identified by Wilson. The large, ornately carved, white building stones of the synagogue stood out prominently among the smaller, plain blocks of local black basalt used for the town&#x27;s other buildings, almost all residential. The synagogue was built almost entirely of white blocks of limestone brought from distant quarries.

The synagogue appears to have been built around the 4th or 5th century. Beneath the foundation of this synagogue lies another foundation made of basalt, and Loffreda suggests that this is the foundation of a synagogue from the 1st century, perhaps the one mentioned in the Gospels. Later excavation work was attempted underneath the synagogue floor, but while Loffreda claimed to have found a paved surface, others are of the opinion that this was an open, paved market area.

The building consists of four parts: the praying hall, the western patio, a southern balustrade and a small room at the northwest of the building. The praying hall measured , with the southern face looking toward Jerusalem. The internal walls were covered with painted plaster and fine stucco work found during the excavations. Watzinger, like Orfali, believed that there had been an upper floor reserved for women, with access by means of an external staircase located in the small room, but this opinion was not substantiated by the later excavations of the site.

The ancient synagogue has two inscriptions, one in Greek and the other in Aramaic, that commemorate the benefactors that helped in the construction of the building. There are also carvings of five- and six-pointed stars and of palm trees.

In 1926, Orfali began restoration of the synagogue. The work was interrupted by his death in a car accident in 1926 (which is commemorated by a Latin inscription carved onto one of the synagogue&#x27;s columns), and was continued by Virgilio Corbo beginning in 1976.

==&quot;House of Peter&quot;==

Ancient Capernaum consisted of a grid of typical compounds of a type called by the Franciscan archaeologists &quot;insula&quot; (Latin for island) - a block of homes around a courtyard. One such compound was called by them the &quot;sacra insula&quot; or &quot;holy insula&quot;, which was found to have a complex history. Located between the synagogue and the lake shore, it was found near the front of a labyrinth of houses from many different periods. Three principal layers have been identified:
# A group of private houses built around the 1st century BC which remained in use until the early 4th century.
# Renovation of one of the houses in the 4th century.
# An octagonal church built over that house in the middle of the 5th century.

The excavators concluded that one house in the village was venerated as the house of Peter the fisherman as early as the mid-1st century, with two churches having been constructed over it.

===1st century===
One compound, slightly larger than most, consisted of a few small rooms clustered around two open courtyards, one to the north and the other to the south. One large and roughly square room in particular, near the east side and joining both courtyards, had walls about long. An open space on the eastern side contained a brick oven. A threshold which allowed crossing between the two courtyards remains well preserved.

Beginning in the latter half of the 1st century AD, this house displayed markedly different characteristics than the other excavated houses. The rough walls of the main room were reworked with care and plastered. Furthermore, almost no domestic ceramics are recovered, but lamps and large storage jars abound. This suggests that the house was no longer used as a residence but a communal gathering place. One explanation suggested for this treatment is that the room was venerated as a religious gathering place, a &quot;domus ecclesiae&quot; or house church, for the Christian community. This suggestion has been critiqued by several scholars, however. In particular, where excavators had claimed to find graffiti including the name of Peter, others have found very little legible writing. Others have questioned whether the space is actually a room; the paved floor, the large space without supports, and the presence of a cooking space have prompted some to note that these are more consistent with yet another courtyard.

===4th-century transformation===
In this period, the &quot;sacra insula&quot; acquired a new appearance. First, a thick-walled, slightly trapezoidal enclosure was built surrounding the entire &quot;insula&quot;; its sides were long. Made of plaster, they reached a height of on the north side. It had two doors, one in the southwest corner and the other in the northeast corner. Next, although there is evidence that the private houses of the compound/&quot;insula&quot; remained in use after the transformation, the one particular room that had before been treated differently was profoundly altered and expanded. A central archway was added to support a roof, and the north wall was strengthened with mortar. Pavement was installed, and the walls and floor were plastered. The 4th-century structure remained standing until the middle of the 5th century, when the &quot;sacra insula&quot; was dismantled and replaced with a larger basilica.

===Octagonal 5th-century church===

The 5th-century church consists of a central octagon with eight pillars, an exterior octagon with thresholds still &quot;in situ&quot;, and a gallery or portico that leads both into the interior of the church as well as into a complex of associated buildings to the east, a linkage achieved via a short passageway. Later this passage was blocked, and an apse with a baptismal pool was constructed in the middle of the east wall. From this wall ascended two stairs on either side of the baptistery, and the excess water from the rite would have escaped along this path. The Byzantines, upon constructing the new church, placed the central octagon directly on top of the walls of Saint Peter&#x27;s house with the aim of preserving its exact location, although none of the original house was visible any longer, as the walls had been torn down and the floor covered in mosaics.

In the portico, the pattern of the mosaic is geometric, with four rows of contiguous circles and small crosses. In the zone of the external octagon, the mosaics represented plants and animals in a style similar to that found in the Basilica of the Feeding of the Five Thousand in nearby Tabgha. In the central octagon, the mosaic was composed of a strip of calcified flowers, of a field of schools of fish with small flowers, and of a great circle with a peacock in the center. The peacock is possibly alluding to Jesus&#x27; healing miracles believed to have taken place at the site.

===Memorial (1990)===
The &quot;memorial&quot; is a modern church built above the excavated remains of the ancient house and the Byzantine octagonal church, dedicated in 1990. The disk-shaped structure stands on eight concrete stilts, ensuring visibility to the venerated ancient building, both directly, at ground level (which allows for a sideways view), and through a glass floor located at the centre of the stilt-raised church (which allows a direct view of the excavated remains below).

<text>In algebraic topology, the Betti numbers are used to distinguish topological spaces based on the connectivity of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional simplicial complexes. For the most reasonable finite-dimensional spaces (such as compact manifolds, finite simplicial complexes or CW complexes), the sequence of Betti numbers is 0 from some point onward (Betti numbers vanish above the dimension of a space), and they are all finite.

The &quot;n&quot;th Betti number represents the rank of the &quot;n&quot;th homology group, denoted &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;, which tells us the maximum number of cuts that can be made before separating a surface into two pieces or 0-cycles, 1-cycles, etc. For example, if formula_1 then formula_2, if formula_3 then formula_4, if formula_5 then formula_6, if formula_7 then formula_8, etc. Note that only the ranks of infinite groups are considered, so for example if formula_9, where formula_10 is the finite cyclic group of order 2, then formula_11. These finite components of the homology groups are their torsion subgroups, and they are denoted by torsion coefficients.

The term &quot;Betti number&quot; was coined by Henri Poincaré after Enrico Betti. The modern formulation is due to Emmy Noether. Betti numbers are used today in fields such as simplicial homology, computer science and digital images.

==Geometric interpretation==

Informally, the &quot;k&quot;th Betti number refers to the number of &quot;k&quot;-dimensional &quot;holes&quot; on a topological surface. A &quot;&quot;k&quot;-dimensional &quot;hole&quot;&quot; is a &quot;k&quot;-dimensional cycle that is not a boundary of a (&quot;k&quot;+1)-dimensional object.

The first few Betti numbers have the following definitions for 0-dimensional, 1-dimensional, and 2-dimensional simplicial complexes:

* &quot;b&quot;0 is the number of connected components;
* &quot;b&quot;1 is the number of one-dimensional or &quot;circular&quot; holes;
* &quot;b&quot;2 is the number of two-dimensional &quot;voids&quot; or &quot;cavities&quot;.

Thus, for example, a torus has one connected surface component so &quot;b&quot;0 = 1, two &quot;circular&quot; holes (one equatorial and one meridional) so &quot;b&quot;1 = 2, and a single cavity enclosed within the surface so &quot;b&quot;2 = 1.

Another interpretation of &quot;b&quot;k is the maximum number of &quot;k&quot;-dimensional curves that can be removed while the object remains connected. For example, the torus remains connected after removing two 1-dimensional curves (equatorial and meridional) so &quot;b&quot;1 = 2.

The two-dimensional Betti numbers are easier to understand because we can see the world in 0, 1, 2, and 3-dimensions.

== Formal definition ==
For a non-negative integer &quot;k&quot;, the &quot;k&quot;th Betti number &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of the space &quot;X&quot; is defined as the rank (number of linearly independent generators) of the abelian group &quot;H&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), the &quot;k&quot;th homology group of &quot;X&quot;. The &quot;k&quot;th homology group is formula_12, the formula_13s are the boundary maps of the simplicial complex and the rank of Hk is the &quot;k&quot;th Betti number. Equivalently, one can define it as the vector space dimension of &quot;H&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;; Q) since the homology group in this case is a vector space over Q. The universal coefficient theorem, in a very simple torsion-free case, shows that these definitions are the same.

More generally, given a field &quot;F&quot; one can define &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;F&quot;), the &quot;k&quot;th Betti number with coefficients in &quot;F&quot;, as the vector space dimension of &quot;H&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;F&quot;).

== Poincaré polynomial ==
The Poincaré polynomial of a surface is defined to be the generating function of its Betti numbers. For example, the Betti numbers of the torus are 1, 2, and 1; thus its Poincaré polynomial is formula_14. The same definition applies to any topological space which has a finitely generated homology.

Given a topological space which has a finitely generated homology, the Poincaré polynomial is defined as the generating function of its Betti numbers, via the polynomial where the coefficient of formula_15 is formula_16.

== Examples ==

===Betti numbers of a graph===
Consider a topological graph &quot;G&quot; in which the set of vertices is &quot;V&quot;, the set of edges is &quot;E&quot;, and the set of connected components is &quot;C&quot;. As explained in the page on graph homology, its homology groups are given by:
: formula_17

This may be proved straightforwardly by mathematical induction on the number of edges. A new edge either increments the number of 1-cycles or decrements the number of connected components.

Therefore, the &quot;zero-th&quot; Betti number &quot;b&quot;0(&quot;G&quot;) equals |&quot;C&quot;|, which is simply the number of connected components.

The first Betti number &quot;b&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;) equals |&quot;E&quot;| + |&quot;C&quot;| - |&quot;V&quot;|. It is also called the cyclomatic number—a term introduced by Gustav Kirchhoff before Betti&#x27;s paper. See cyclomatic complexity for an application to software engineering.

All other Betti numbers are 0.

===Betti numbers of a simplicial complex===

Consider a simplicial complex with 0-simplices: a, b, c, and d, 1-simplices: E, F, G, H and I, and the only 2-simplex is J, which is the shaded region in the figure. There is one connected component in this figure (&quot;b&quot;0); one hole, which is the unshaded region (&quot;b&quot;1); and no &quot;voids&quot; or &quot;cavities&quot; (&quot;b&quot;2).

This means that the rank of formula_18 is 1, the rank of formula_19 is 1 and the rank of formula_20 is 0.

The Betti number sequence for this figure is 1, 1, 0, 0, ...; the Poincaré polynomial is formula_21.

=== Betti numbers of the projective plane ===
The homology groups of the projective plane &quot;P&quot; are:
: formula_22

Here, Z2 is the cyclic group of order 2. The 0-th Betti number is again 1. However, the 1-st Betti number is 0. This is because &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;P&quot;) is a finite group - it does not have any infinite component. The finite component of the group is called the torsion coefficient of &quot;P&quot;. The (rational) Betti numbers &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) do not take into account any torsion in the homology groups, but they are very useful basic topological invariants. In the most intuitive terms, they allow one to count the number of &quot;holes&quot; of different dimensions.

==Properties==

=== Euler characteristic ===
For a finite CW-complex &quot;K&quot; we have

:formula_23

where formula_24 denotes Euler characteristic of &quot;K&quot; and any field &quot;F&quot;.

=== Cartesian product ===
For any two spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; we have

:formula_25

where formula_26 denotes the Poincaré polynomial of &quot;X&quot;, (more generally, the Hilbert–Poincaré series, for infinite-dimensional spaces), i.e., the generating function of the Betti numbers of &quot;X&quot;:
:formula_27
see Künneth theorem.

=== Symmetry ===
If &quot;X&quot; is &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold, there is symmetry interchanging formula_28 and formula_29, for any formula_28:
:formula_31

under conditions (a &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;oriented&quot; manifold); see Poincaré duality.

=== Different coefficients ===
The dependence on the field &quot;F&quot; is only through its characteristic. If the homology groups are torsion-free, the Betti numbers are independent of &quot;F&quot;. The connection of &quot;p&quot;-torsion and the Betti number for characteristic &quot;p&quot;, for &quot;p&quot; a prime number, is given in detail by the universal coefficient theorem (based on Tor functors, but in a simple case).

==More examples==
# The Betti number sequence for a circle is 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...;
#: the Poincaré polynomial is
#:: formula_21.
# The Betti number sequence for a three-torus is 1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, ... .
#: the Poincaré polynomial is
#:: formula_33.
# Similarly, for an &quot;n&quot;-torus,
#: the Poincaré polynomial is
#:: formula_34 (by the Künneth theorem), so the Betti numbers are the binomial coefficients.

It is possible for spaces that are infinite-dimensional in an essential way to have an infinite sequence of non-zero Betti numbers. An example is the infinite-dimensional complex projective space, with sequence 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, ... that is periodic, with period length 2.
In this case the Poincaré function is not a polynomial but rather an infinite series 
:formula_35,

which, being a geometric series, can be expressed as the rational function
: formula_36

More generally, any sequence that is periodic can be expressed as a sum of geometric series, generalizing the above. For example formula_37 has the generating function 
:formula_38

and more generally linear recursive sequences are exactly the sequences generated by rational functions; thus the Poincaré series is expressible as a rational function if and only if the sequence of Betti numbers is a linear recursive sequence.

The Poincaré polynomials of the compact simple Lie groups are:
:formula_39

==Relationship with dimensions of spaces of differential forms==
In geometric situations when formula_40 is a closed manifold, the importance of the Betti numbers may arise from a different direction, namely that they predict the dimensions of vector spaces of closed differential forms &quot;modulo&quot; exact differential forms. The connection with the definition given above is via three basic results, de Rham&#x27;s theorem and Poincaré duality (when those apply), and the universal coefficient theorem of homology theory.

There is an alternate reading, namely that the Betti numbers give the dimensions of spaces of harmonic forms. This requires the use of some of the results of Hodge theory on the Hodge Laplacian.

In this setting, Morse theory gives a set of inequalities for alternating sums of Betti numbers in terms of a corresponding alternating sum of the number of critical points formula_41 of a Morse function of a given index:

:formula_42

Edward Witten gave an explanation of these inequalities by using the Morse function to modify the exterior derivative in the de Rham complex.

<text>A résumé or resume (or alternatively resumé), is a document created and used by a person to present their background, skills, and accomplishments. Résumés can be used for a variety of reasons, but most often are used to secure new jobs, whether in the same organization or another.

A typical résumé contains a summary of relevant job experience and education. The résumé is usually one of the first items, along with a cover letter and sometimes an application for employment, a potential employer sees regarding the job seeker and is used to screen applicants before offering an interview.

In the UK, EMEA, and Asian countries, a curriculum vitae (CV) is used for similar purposes. This international CV is more akin to the résumé—a summary of one&#x27;s education and experience—than to the longer and more detailed CV expected in U.S. academic circles. However, international CVs vary by country. For example, many Middle East and African countries and some parts of Asia require personal data (e.g., photograph, gender, marital status, children) while this is not accepted in the UK, U.S., and some European countries.

In South Asian countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, biodata is often used in place of a résumé.

==History==
The word &quot;résumé&quot; comes from the French word meaning &#x27;to summarize&#x27;. Leonardo da Vinci is sometimes credited with the first résumé, though his &quot;résumé&quot; takes the form of a letter written about 1481–1482 to a potential employer, Ludovico Sforza. For the next 450 years, the résumé continued to be simply a description of a person, including abilities and past employment. In the early 1900s, résumés included information like weight, height, marital status, and religion. By 1950, résumés were considered mandatory and started to include information like personal interests and hobbies. It was not until the 1970s, the beginning of the Digital Age, that résumés took on a more professional look in terms of presentation and content. The start of the 21st century saw a further evolution for résumés on the internet as social media helped people spread résumés faster. 

In 2001 LinkedIn was launched, which allowed users to post their résumés and skills online. Since, many SaaS companies began providing job seekers with free online résumé builders; usually templates to insert credentials and experience and create a résumé to download or an online portfolio link to share via social media.

With the launch of YouTube in 2005, video résumés became common, and more and more high school students began to send them to different colleges and universities.

==Description==
In many contexts, a résumé is typically limited to one or two pages of size A4 or letter-size, highlighting only those experiences and qualifications that the author considers most relevant to the desired position. Many résumés contain keywords or skills that potential employers are looking for via applicant tracking systems (ATS), make heavy use of active verbs, and display content in a flattering manner. Acronyms and credentials after the applicant&#x27;s name should be spelled out fully in the appropriate section of the résumé to increase the likelihood they are found in a computerized keyword scan.

A résumé is a marketing document in which the content should be adapted to suit each individual job application or applications aimed at a particular industry. In late 2002, job seekers and students started making interactive résumés such as résumés having links, clickable phone numbers and email addresses. With the launch of YouTube in 2006, job seekers and students also started to create multimedia and video résumés. Job seekers were able to circumvent the application for employment process and reach employers through direct email contact and résumé blasting, a term meaning the mass distribution of résumés to increase personal visibility within the job market. However, the mass distribution of résumés to employers can often have a negative effect on the applicant&#x27;s chances of securing employment as the résumés tend not to be tailored for the specific positions the applicant is applying for. It is usually, therefore, more sensible to optimize the résumé for each position applied for and its keywords In order to keep track of all experiences, keeping a &quot;master résumé&quot; document is recommended, providing job seekers with the ability to customize a tailored résumé while making sure extraneous information is easily accessible for future use if needed.

The complexity or simplicity of various résumé formats tends to produce results varying from person to person, for the occupation, and the industry. Résumés or CVs used by medical professionals, professors, artists, and people in other specialized fields may be comparatively longer. For example, an artist&#x27;s résumé, typically focused on experience and achievements in the artistic field, may include extensive lists of solo and group exhibitions.

==Styles==
Résumés may be organized in different ways. The following are some of the more common résumé formats:

=== Reverse chronological résumé ===
A reverse chronological résumé, the current preferred standard as of 2024, lists a candidate&#x27;s job experiences in chronological order (last thing first), generally covering the previous 10 to 15 years. Positions are listed with starting and ending dates. Current positions on a résumé typically list the starting date to the present. The reverse chronological résumé format is optimal for professionals who are making advancements in the same vertical. In this format, the main body is the Experience section, starting from the most recent experience and moving chronologically backward through previous experience. The reverse chronological résumé works to build credibility through experience gained, while illustrating career growth over time and filling all gaps in a career trajectory. In the United Kingdom the chronological résumé tends to extend only as far back as the applicant&#x27;s GCSE/Standard Grade qualifications.

===Functional résumé===
Largely fallen from favor, the functional résumé listed work experience and skills sorted by skill area or job function and specific to the type of position being sought. This format directly emphasizes specific professional capabilities and utilizes experience summaries as its primary means of communicating professional competency. The functional résumé was used by individuals making a career change, a varied work history, or relevant roles which were held some time ago. Rather than focus on the length of time that has passed, the functional résumé allowed the reader to identify those skills quickly. However, it has largely been replaced by hybrid résumé.

===Hybrid or combination résumé===
A hybrid or combination résumé combines the best of the reverse chronological and functional resume formats. Opening with a profile or summary to showcase the most relevant information, it often continues with a section of highlights and/or a list of strengths before listing reverse chronological experience and education. This enables the candidate to present the most relevant strengths and impressive accomplishments at the top. This format is particularly helpful for candidates who have employment gaps, may have more than one to two short-term roles, or have relevant experience from early in their careers. It is also excellent for those who are looking to change fields or industries. The strength of this format is it spotlights relevant information up front and deemphasizes less relevant titles and less desirable chronological issues. 

=== Blind résumé ===
A blind résumé is a modern and equitable style used by some employers to focus on an applicant&#x27;s qualifications and experience by removing any personal identifying information that could potentially result in bias. By excluding or minimizing details such as the candidate&#x27;s name, age, gender, address, or educational background, blind résumés aim to ensure that recruiters assess candidates based solely on relevant information like their academic qualification, abilities, experience, and skills, rather than on discriminatory factors such as ethnicity, gender, or academic pedigree, which do not provide meaningful insights into the candidate&#x27;s qualifications. This method is designed to promote fairness, equality, and diversity in recruitment by reducing the impact of biases that often influence hiring decisions, particularly for racialized and diverse job applicants. Studies have shown that candidates with certain demographic characteristics, such as names associated with a particular race or gender, are often unfairly disadvantaged in the hiring process. While the challenge of deeply ingrained systemic bias cannot be fully addressed by blind résumés alone, and not all recruiters may be familiar with this approach, it is considered a best practice among some organizations and applicants. This de-biasing approach is promoted in environments where broader systemic changes to address biases in hiring practices, interviews, and promotions within organizations are still evolving.

===Infographic and video résumés===
As the Internet becomes largely driven by multimedia, job-seekers have sought to take advantage of the trend by moving their résumés away from the traditional to website résumés or e-résumés. Video and infographic résumés have gained popularity in the creative and media industries. This trend has attracted criticism from human resources management professionals, who warn that this may be a passing fad and that multimedia-based résumés may be overlooked by recruiters whose workflow is designed only to accommodate a traditional résumé format. 

=== Applicant tracking systems (ATS) and online résumés ===
According to Forbes, almost 85% of employers use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), and it is common for employers to only accept résumés digitally. This has changed much about the manner in which résumés are written, read, and processed, as paper-based résumés become an exception rather than the rule.

Many employers and recruitment agencies insist on résumés in a particular file format. Most prefer Microsoft Word documents, while others will only accept résumés formatted in PDF or plain ASCII text.

Since almost all employers now find candidates through search engines and ATS, which use artificial intelligence (AI) to search, filter, and manage high volumes of résumés, it is critical to tailor résumés to ATS standard or risk being eliminated: according to the Harvard Business Review (HBR), 88% of employers believe qualified applicants are filtered out by ATS.

ATS and to some extent other search engines use natural language processors to parse résumés. Résumé parsers often correctly interpret some parts of the résumé while missing or misinterpreting others. The best résumé parsers capture a high percentage of information regarding location, names, and titles, but remain less accurate with skills, industries, and other less structured information, and can fail entirely if faced with formats they are not designed to handle. 

According to Indeed, the ideal ATS-friendly résumé uses Arial, Calibri, Cambria, Garamond or Georgia font, does not include graphs, tables, or headers (formatted headers not sections), and uses &quot;keywords&quot; or role-specific words and descriptions in a job description. Shapes, text boxes, other graphic images should be avoided on résumés or they can set off ATS filters (each ATS varies). Résumés written following these rules are more likely to be correctly captured by, and ranked higher by, ATS, thereby making candidates more findable.

AI tools can also be used to test résumés, but AI-generated resume content must be rigorously verified and edited as generative AI produces very consistent sentence structure, and under different jobs with similar responsibilities, often repeats identical phrases. This can catch the attention of algorithms, so résumés must be edited carefully to be make it through ATS to be seen by potential employers.

Having a résumé online was first pioneered by professions that benefit from the multimedia and rich detail of an HTML résumé (such as actors, photographers, graphic designers, developers, dancers, etc.) but all job seekers should now have a digital version of their résumé available to employers and professionals who use Internet recruiting.

<doc id="346271" wikidata="Q3317777" url="?curid=346271" title="Mode 13h">
<text>Mode 13h is the standard 256-color mode on VGA graphics hardware introduced in 1987 with the IBM PS/2. It has a resolution of pixels. It was used in computer games and art/animation software of the late 1980s and early to mid-1990s. &quot;13h&quot; refers to the number of the mode in the VGA BIOS. The &quot;h&quot; stands for hexadecimal.

Mode 13h provides programmers with a linear block of video memory, where each byte represents one pixel. This allows ease of programming at the expense of access to other useful features of the VGA hardware.

Given the aspect ratio of a resolution screen for use on a 4:3 display, Mode 13h does not have square pixels.

== Technical details ==
Mode 13h is something of a curiosity, because the VGA is a planar device from a hardware perspective, and not suited to chunky graphics operation. The VGA has 256 KiB of video memory consisting of 4 banks of 64 KiB, known as planes (or &#x27;maps&#x27; in IBM&#x27;s documentation). Planar memory arrangement splits the pixels horizontally into groups of four. For any given byte in the PC&#x27;s 64 KiB video memory aperture, four pixels can be accessed on screen by selecting the required plane(s). This is more complicated for the programmer, but allows access to all of the available video memory and other benefits (see Mode X). 

Mode 13h, however, allows the programmer to access the VGA in &quot;chunky&quot; (linear) fashion, where each consecutive address in the aperture represents a consecutive pixel on screen. Planes need not be manipulated to select the correct pixels to modify or read. This is achieved using the VGA &#x27;Chain 4&#x27; setting in which the lowest two bits of the 16 bit aperture address are used to select the plane to write to/read from. The upshot is that the programmer has a simple access model; the downside is that now only 214 (16 KiB) of the video plane&#x27;s address space are accessible (the other 2 bits being used to select planes) so only a total of 64 KiB is addressable (4 × 16 KiB). The upper 48 KiB of each plane remains unused in this mode.

Unlike SVGA and higher color depths, Mode 13h, part of the MCGA set of video modes, has 18 bits of color, 6 per RGB channel. The color palette data is not stored in memory &quot;per se&quot;, but rather modified, read and written to by low level I/O port calls, to the DAC registers.

The palette data was often copied from the low level ports one at a time to a spot in memory after the screen data so the colors could be saved along with the pixels they belonged to. A mode 13h screen capture is merely 64,000 bytes of values from 0 to 255, each an index of a color from a known palette of multiple colors. If the color palette is jumbled or totally wrong, a green leaf will appear blue, or any other possible color, depending on what that particular color was set for, which particular one out of 256.

Due to the way chunks of memory are allocated in such an environment, the bytes in segment 0xA000 from offset 64000 to 64768, can be written to with no negative effects. This lets the programmer save the additional bytes, 256 (colors) × 3 (color channels) = 768 bytes, at the end of the screen capture file. These have to be read back out again and written to the color port for them to change, when an image containing a footer of color info gets loaded. A method used with this was to have a global palette, and match the colors from an old color palette, to a new color palette. This meant changing the index of each pixel, where it would point to a near perfect match of one color from old to new color set. This also had drawbacks, as sometimes there were not enough gradients, and artifacts and such would appear.

It is not essential to set the graphics mode through the BIOS; it is possible to switch graphics mode in 32-bit protected mode, if a little more complicated. It involves writing size data to the VGA controller.

===Variants===
An alternative planar 256-color mode is available by disabling Chain 4 mode (unchaining). Video modes created using this technique are collectively called Mode X, though the original use of that term was for a VGA mode which also had square pixels. While these modes (along with very many other possible VGA modes) were not specifically documented by IBM, the VGA hardware functions and features used to implement them were documented at least as early as 1988, in the &quot;PS/2 Hardware Interface Technical Reference&quot;.

== Notation ==
In x86 assembly language the mode is entered when &quot;AL&quot; is 13h, &quot;AH&quot; is 0 and BIOS INT 10h is executed. However, the &quot;h&quot; is sometimes dropped for languages that don&#x27;t support that method of notation; for example, it is known as screen mode 13 in QuickBASIC and its spinoffs. QuickBASIC has its own screen mode numbering scheme, and many QuickBASIC screen modes have numbers which differ from the BIOS modes on which they are based.
In C, hexadecimal 13 is written 0x13.

<text>Surte () is a locality situated in Ale Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 5,798 inhabitants in 2010. Surte Church is located in the town.

It is located some 15 kilometers north of Gothenburg. Surte became well known for its glass works that started production in 1862 and became one of the major mechanized glass works in Sweden. It was bought by in 1960 and shut down in 1978.

In Surte, there was a large landslide in 1950, which killed one person and destroyed 30 houses. More houses had to be removed, causing 450 people to lose their home. It also blocked the river which had frequent ship traffic.

Surte was the hometown of Alexander Samuelson. Although he was not the designer, he was the man named on the 1915 design patent for the legendary contour Coca-Cola bottle.

The international Grand Master of chess Gideon Ståhlberg, one of the world&#x27;s strongest players in the 1940s, was born and is buried in Surte.

Surte is home to the bandy club Surte BK. They built one of the first indoor bandy arenas in Sweden (and subsequently in the world), which was the first in Götaland.

The village Bohus, located 2½ km (1½ mile) north of Surte centre, has grown together with Surte and, in official statistics, is handled as one village.

<doc id="346280" wikidata="Q605468" url="?curid=346280" title="Communist Party of Poland">
<text>The interwar Communist Party of Poland (, KPP) was a communist party active in Poland during the Second Polish Republic. It resulted from a December 1918 merger of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL) and the Polish Socialist Party – Left (PPS – Left) into the Communist Workers&#x27; Party of Poland (&quot;Komunistyczna Partia Robotnicza Polski&quot;, KPRP). The communists were a small force in Polish politics.

The Communist Party of Poland (until 1925 the Communist Workers&#x27; Party of Poland) was an organization of the radical Left. Following the ideas of Rosa Luxemburg, the party&#x27;s aim was to create a Polish Socialist Republic, to be included in the planned Pan-European Commonwealth of Socialist States. The party did not support the formation of the Second Polish Republic in 1918 and supported the Bolsheviks (led by Vladimir Lenin) in the 1920 Polish–Soviet War.

The views adhered to and promulgated by the leaders of the KPP (Maria Koszutska, Adolf Warski, Maksymilian Horwitz, and Edward Próchniak) led to the party&#x27;s difficult relationship with Stalin. The Communist International (Comintern) condemned the KPP for its support of Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s May Coup of 1926 (the party&#x27;s &quot;May error&quot;). From 1933, the KPP was increasingly treated with suspicion by the Comintern. The party structures were seen as compromised due to infiltration by agents of the Polish military intelligence. Some of the party leaders, falsely accused of being such agents, were subsequently executed in the Soviet Union. In 1935 and 1936, the KPP undertook a formation of a unified worker and peasant front in Poland and was then subjected to further persecutions by the Comintern, which also arbitrarily accused the Polish communists of harboring Trotskyists elements in their ranks. The apogee of the Moscow-held prosecutions, aimed at eradicating the various &quot;deviations&quot; and ending usually in death sentences, took place in 1937–38, with the last executions carried out in 1940.

KPP members were persecuted and often imprisoned by the Polish Sanation regime, which turned out to likely save the lives of a number of future Polish communist leaders, including Bolesław Bierut, Władysław Gomułka, Alfred Lampe, Edward Ochab, Stefan Jędrychowski, and Aleksander Zawadzki (among former KPP members transferred during World War II from the Soviet Union to Poland for conspiratorial work were Mieczysław Moczar and Marian Spychalski). During the Great Purge, seventy members and candidate members of the party&#x27;s central committee fled or were brought to the Soviet Union and were shot there, along with many other activists (almost all prominent Polish communists were murdered or sent to labor camps). The Comintern, in reality directed by Stalin, in 1938 had the party dissolved and liquidated.

==Party history==

===1918–1921===
====The origins====
The KPRP was founded on 16 December 1918. It joined the SDKPiL (one of whose leaders was Rosa Luxemburg) and the PPS – Left. It followed the program of the former. Unification of the trade union movement was a prime objective behind the merger.

The members of the new party organized Workers&#x27; Councils in Poland, which competed with the more popular Polish Socialist Party (PPS) units for working class support. The KPRP remained a small minority of the leftist movement, in part because of Luxemburg&#x27;s position that Poland should remain a province of Russia rather than regain independence. In March 1919, through its representative Józef Unszlicht, the KPRP took part in the founding of the Communist International (Comintern or the Third International) in Moscow.

====The Polish-Soviet War====
The KPRP opposed Poland&#x27;s war against Soviet Russia of 1919–21. During the fighting, the KPRP&#x27;s legal status was legislatively taken away; the communist party would remain an underground organization in Poland until its demise. Due to the support for the government provided by pro-independence socialists of the PPS, efforts by the KPRP to agitate for workers&#x27; solidarity with the Red Army were forestalled. However, at the height of the Red Army offensive the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee was formed on 2 August 1920. It consisted of Julian Marchlewski, Felix Dzerzhinsky, Feliks Kon, Józef Unszlicht, and Edward Próchniak. Its establishment brought no political gains for the party. The traditional Marxist position on the land question as understood by the Polish Marxists was abandoned, in favour of Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s views.

===1921–1926===
The period of 1921–1926 saw relative political freedom in Poland and the KPRP took advantage of the opportunities. Gains in membership were initially made from the ranks of the reformist workers&#x27; organisations and in the late 1920s from a left-wing faction of the PPS, led by Stanislaw Lancucki and Jerzy Czeszejko-Sochacki. They joined the KPRP, giving the party representation in the &quot;Sejm&quot; (Polish legislature). Gains were also made from the General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland when a faction led by Aleksander Minc joined and from two smaller Jewish socialist groups: Poale Zion and the United Jewish Socialist Workers Party (&quot;Fareynikte&quot;). In the eastern borderlands, the KPRP and then KPP operated as the autonomous Communist Party of Western Ukraine (KPZU) and Communist Party of Western Belorussia (KPZB); substantial growth in membership was experienced there at this time. In the area of operation of KPP proper (western and central Poland numerically dominated by ethnic Poles), 22–26% of the members were Jewish, according to the party sources.

In 1922, the leadership consolidated around Adolf Warski, Maksymilian Horwitz, and Maria Koszutska of the &quot;majority&quot; faction, more moderate and dominant in the party until at least 1924. The &quot;minority&quot; faction was later led by Julian Leszczyński. The party founded the Red Factions within the unions. An electoral list called the &quot;Union of Town and Country Proletariat&quot; was constructed and the party managed to win 130,000 votes and two parliamentary seats in the legislative election of November 1922.

The party&#x27;s Second Congress gathered in Moscow in August 1923. The leadership overhauled the party program, particularly with regard to the land and national questions, where more Leninist policies were adopted. Autonomous sections of the party were recognised as needed in Poland&#x27;s eastern regions, which were heavily inhabited by ethnically non-Polish groups (Western Ukraine and Western Belorussia). Within the Communist International (Comintern), the Polish leaders aligned with Grigory Zinoviev and not with the embryonic Left Opposition.

The Polish party was independently minded, and in the Polish Commission convened at the Comintern&#x27;s Fifth Congress (1924), made efforts to defend both Leon Trotsky and Heinrich Brandler, the leader of the Communist Party of Germany. The main prosecutor in the case against the Polish leadership was Julian Leszczyński, but the Polish Commission was chaired by Stalin. Leszczyński was appointed, without reference to a party congress, to the new party central committee. His task was to &quot;Bolshevise&quot; the KPRP.

The party&#x27;s Third Congress gathered at Minsk in March 1925 with the slogan &quot;Bolshevisation of the party&quot;. This meant that the basic party unit was to be a workplace cell and an all-powerful party apparatus was constructed to decide policy. All factional tendencies were banned. Significantly, the party&#x27;s name was contracted to &quot;Communist Party of Poland&quot; (KPP). Despite being endorsed by the leadership of the Comintern, Leszczyński&#x27;s leadership group was independently minded enough to adopt positions on Germany, Bulgaria, and France contrary to those of the Comintern. It was removed from office by yet another Polish Commission. Warski returned to the leadership and the party again pursued attempts to build a united front with the PPS.

===1926–1938===

====The KPP and Piłsudski&#x27;s &quot;coup&quot;====
Poland&#x27;s democratically elected coalition government was conflicted and in 1926 faced serious trouble of economic and other nature. On 12 May, the still-popular, semi-retired General Józef Piłsudski initiated a &quot;coup d’etat&quot;. Pilsudski, who in his youth and before World War I was a leader of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS), retained in many circles a reputation as a friend of the Left and the Polish communists were among those confused by his present actions. When railway workers went on strike, the PPS declared a general strike. &quot;Even the tiny and illegal Polish Communist Party announced support for what they termed Piłsudski&#x27;s &#x27;revolutionary armies&#x27;.&quot; The railway workers were vital, because during the fighting they blocked troop trains trying to deliver reinforcements for the government. On 14 May, the government leaders decided to stop resisting the coup and resigned.

During Piłsudski&#x27;s May coup, the KPP engaged in street battles with troops loyal to the government of Wincenty Witos, which it called fascist. The KPP leaders directly aided the coup, for which they would pay a steep price. After the events Stalin sharply denounced the KPP leadership and they were eventually ousted for their &quot;May error&quot;.

The debate over the &quot;May error&quot; was getting increasingly venomous before and during the party&#x27;s Fourth Congress in September 1927 in Moscow. In the aftermath, two representatives of the Comintern were placed on the Polish party&#x27;s Central Committee: the Finn Otto Wille Kuusinen and the Ukrainian Dmitry Manuilsky; the KPP was no longer in a position to exercise any independence of thought and action.

Despite the internal factional struggles, the party grew during this period, attracting support from the minorities and among the working class. It participated in the 1928 Polish legislative election. However, the removal of the Warski group from leadership resulted in the party plunged into isolation as it embarked on the &quot;Third Period&quot;. Endorsed by the KPP&#x27;s Fifth Congress in 1930, the Third Period saw the party routinely describing the PPS as fascist and revolution was claimed to be imminent. As the country was hit severely by the Great Depression, the KPP became embroiled in a new internal struggle.

====Polish communists in the 1930s====
The popular front strategy was pursued by the KPP in the mid-1930s. The KPP pressed both the PPS and Bund for unity, which both rebuffed. The communists tried to infiltrate organisations alien to the workers&#x27; movement, such as the Peasant Party and even Catholic groups. Unity of the Left remained an impossible goal, however.

Many militants of the KPP joined the International Brigades to fight the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War. The Dąbrowski Battalion, named for the hero of the Paris Commune, was led by the KPP but counted among its members many PPS workers and other non-KPP volunteers.

====The KPP liquidated by Stalin====
In the mid and late 1930s, the KPP became a victim of paranoia and suspicion that engulfed the communist movement led by Joseph Stalin. It culminated in the Moscow trials and purges. A number of KPP members were accused of being agents of institutions of Sanation Poland and liquidated. Next almost the entire leading cadre of the party became embroiled in the purges and murdered. Many were summoned to Moscow for &quot;consultations&quot;. Among those killed were: Albert Bronkowski, Władysław Stein-Krajewski, Józef Unszlicht, Adolf Warski, Maria Koszutska, Maksymilian Horwitz, Julian Leszczyński, Stanisław Bobiński, Jerzy Heryng, Józef Feliks Ciszewski, Tomasz Dąbal, Saul Amsterdam, Bruno Jasieński, and Witold Wandurski. The leaderless party was then accused of Trotskyism among other &quot;deviations&quot;; on August 16, 1938 dissolved by the Comintern. Most of the KPP activists perished in the Great Purge, but among those who survived were some of the future leaders of communist Poland.

==Policies and positions==
The KPP was guided by Marxist ideology under a strictly orthodox interpretation. It opposed the establishment of a politically independent Poland. Its activists functioned as party members and government officials in Soviet Russia. The KPP was against land reform (distribution of property to landless peasants). It aimed to organize the working class and to unify the trade union movement. It adhered to policies established by the Comintern in Moscow. Its status was illegal, as it refused to register as a political party.

==The Polish Workers&#x27; Party==
Arriving from the Soviet Union, a group of Polish communists was parachuted into occupied Poland in December 1941. With Stalin&#x27;s permission, in January 1942 they established the Polish Workers&#x27; Party, a new communist party.

<text>The Sun () was one of the newspapers in Hong Kong, first published in March 1999. It belonged to the Oriental Press Group Limited (東方報業集團有限公司). The paper ceased publication in April 2016.

There was also an electronic version of &quot;The Sun &quot; on the Internet. Both the newspaper and the electronic version were written in traditional Chinese.

==Background==
&quot;No fear for wind and storm and with the emergence of the &quot;Sun&quot;, a sharp contrast will be found between black and white&quot;. () was the slogan used by &quot;The Sun &quot; when it first appeared in the market. The phrase actually means &quot;There is no need to fear trials and tribulations, for once the sun rises, all things will become clear, the righteous will shine and the wrong will hide in the shadows.&quot;

Since the newspaper market in 1999 has already been well-developed, &quot;The Sun&quot; adopted an aggressive marketing strategy to gain as much market share as possible, initially selling the paper for only $2. This triggered a price war among all the local newspapers in Hong Kong. At that time, most newspapers reduced their prices by half. However this competition did not last very long. The price of all newspapers gradually rose again after a few months&#x27; time. &quot;The Sun&quot; followed and gradually raised the price as well. Ultimately this price war made 6 newspaper companies run out of business.

In addition to price-cutting, &quot;The Sun&quot; used various methods to attract people to buy their paper, such as giving away T-shirts with the &quot;Sun&quot;″s logo. Moreover, it enclosed some souvenirs such as toys, books and fast-food restaurant discount coupons.

==Style==
The newspaper provided various kinds of news daily. It includes local and international news, financial news, entertainment news, sports news, technology information, horse-racing news and news reporting trendy stuff among young people.

Regarding the horse-racing news, it gained a very good reputation among horse gamblers. For the entertainment news, it reported both the local and foreign celebrities&#x27; news, so as to entertain different citizens&#x27; interests. In addition, it often offers some coupons to the readers. It was a way to attract more buyers.

In the page of financial news, there was a column for some financial analysts and economic experts to write articles related to the financial and stock market in Hong Kong. To further diversify its newspaper, &quot;The Sun&quot; was publishing a guide book with information of secondary schools and overseas schools for Form 5 students to read before the release of HKCEE results.

==Readership==
Over 1,000,000 people read the &quot;Sun&quot; daily and 29,000 readers subscribe its electronic newspaper. It was the third best-selling newspaper in Hong Kong, whereas &quot;Oriental Daily&quot; and &quot;Apple Daily&quot; rank first and second respectively.

The &quot;Sun&quot; always sponsored organizations which promote teenage functions, for instance, JSSE, so as to increase the teenage pool to buy its newspaper. These sponsors were mainly communication services, mobile phone companies and supermarkets.

Most of the readers were youngsters and bourgeois. As their purchasing power is relatively high, it attracted people from different fields. They wanted to promote their products and pay money to put advertisements on the newspaper. The advertising fee was the lowest among the local newspapers as they have guaranteed.

==Major competitors==
The reporting style, target market and target customers of &quot;Sun Daily&quot; were similar to that of &quot;Apple Daily&quot; and &quot;Oriental Daily News&quot;. Since the &quot;Sun&quot; and &quot;Oriental Daily News&quot; both belonged to the Oriental Press Group Limited, together they saw &quot;Apple Daily&quot; as the biggest competitor.

==Online edition==
&quot;The Sun &quot; cooperated with &quot;Oriental Daily News&quot; to offer &quot;orisun.com&quot;. According to Ma Ching Kwan, chairman of Oriental Press Group, the site enabled overseas Chinese to keep up with Hong Kong news. The news was updated daily at 5.00am.

This co-operation provided many mutual benefits to both newspapers. They shared the up-to-date news together. This greatly helped both newspapers get higher rankings than other newspapers. To improve the quality of the service, &quot;orisun.com&quot; was equipping itself by getting better access to overseas database system and broadband service. This enabled the web-browsers from overseas to download the newspaper at a faster speed.

The online content was divided into seven parts: politics, finance, entertainment, sport, technology, feature and horse racing. For people who need to refer back to the old news, online newspaper would be really helpful. However, to browse any old news, the &quot;orisun.com&quot; charges, though it was still free for &quot;the-sun.com.hk&quot;.

&quot;orisun.com&quot; and &quot;the-sun.com.hk&quot; were struggling to secure market share as more and more newspapers and news magazines have online versions.

==Hotline==
&quot;The Sun&quot; set up a hotline and a fax number for people to report the news happening around them. If those news possessed potential that could arouse citizens&#x27; interest or entertain people, reporters would investigate the issue and post them on the newspaper.

==Closure==
&quot;The Sun&quot; ceased publication on 1 April 2016 after 17 years in print. The owner cited the &quot;recent deteriorating business environment in Hong Kong&quot; as the reason for the decision. &quot;Oriental Daily News&quot;, one of the bestselling papers in Hong Kong which is also owned by Oriental Press Group Limited, is not affected by the decision.
