<text>Richard Cameron (1648? – 22 July 1680) was a leader of the militant Presbyterians, known as Covenanters, who resisted attempts by the Stuart monarchs to control the affairs of the Church of Scotland, acting through bishops. While attempting to revive the flagging fortunes of the Covenanting cause in 1680, he was tracked down by the authorities and killed in a clash of arms at Airds Moss in Ayrshire. His followers took his name as the Cameronians and ultimately formed the nucleus of the later Scottish regiment of the same name, the Cameronians. The regiment was disbanded in 1968.

==Life==

Cameron was born at Falkland, Fife in 1647, or 1648, the son of Allan and Margaret Cameron who farmed the estate of Fordell, near Leuchars. St Salvator&#x27;s College of St Andrews University has a record of his enrolment in the Arts faculty there on 5 March 1662. After graduation he returned to Falkland where he found employment as the parish school teacher and precentor in late 1669 or early 1670. It was some time after this that he began to attend conventicles. On 16 April 1675 he, his brother Michael and his parents were summoned to appear at the local court, charged with &quot;keeping conventicles at the house of John Geddie in Falkland&quot; and &quot;withdrawing from the parish church&quot;. The outcome of the case is not known, but it is likely that the accused were fined; and it is known that the entire family moved shortly thereafter to Edinburgh where Michael had married into the family of a burgess. Here Cameron came under the spiritual guidance of an itinerant field-preacher, John Welwood. After a brief period employed as private chaplain to the wife of Sir William Scott of Harden in 1675, Cameron was dismissed from service for refusing to attend the parish church on the Sabbath. With Welwood&#x27;s encouragement Cameron became increasingly religiously active and was eventually licensed as a field preacher in 1678.

Between 1669 and 1672, two Indulgences were granted in the name of Charles II, intended to bring over 270 dissenters, a third of the ministry, back into the fold of the Church of Scotland. While over 40 outed ministers agreed to the new terms, submitting themselves to the Crown&#x27;s High Church Anglican form of church governance—which meant accepting episcopacy and the King as head of the church—Cameron remained with those who rejected any accommodation that would compromise their presbyterian principles. He was accused by moderates of fomenting division in the Kirk by declaring his opposition to the Indulgences in his public preaching and formally summoned to appear three times before presbyteries, the moderator urging him to be &quot;circumspect and inoffensive&quot;. In early 1679, amid mounting pressure from indulged ministers, Cameron embarked for the Netherlands to join other exiles.

The year 1679 was one of continuing confrontation between the Covenanters and the authorities, culminating in the assassination of Archbishop Sharp, the so-called &quot;Rutherglen Declaration&quot; and the battles of Drumclog and Bothwell Bridge. In late July or early August, Cameron was ordained a Church of Scotland minister at the Scots Kirk in Rotterdam. The Rev. Robert MacWard, who conducted the ceremony, reportedly said prophetically to the onlookers,

&quot;Richard, the publick standard of the Gospel is fallen in Scotland; and, if I know anything of the mind of the Lord, ye are called to undergo your trials before us, and go home and lift the fallen standard, and display it before the world. But, before you put your hand to it, ye shall go to as many of the field ministers as ye can find, and give them your hearty invitation to go with you; and if they will not go, go your lone, and the Lord will go with you. Behold, all ye beholders! Here is the head of a faithful minister and servant of Jesus Christ, who shall lose the same for his Master&#x27;s interest; and it shall be set up before sun and moon in the public view of the world.&quot;

Several weeks later Cameron returned to Scotland, where in the meantime a Third Indulgence had been granted and accepted by a vote in the General Assembly. Hoping to revive the cause of the demoralised Covenanters after their recent defeats, he resumed his field-preaching after reporting in code to McWard, &quot;I was received with more affection and joy than ever before.&quot; On 8 December he wrote again in code to Rotterdam,

&quot;I have got a far better market than was expected when I came from you; our wares vend well, both in open markets and in houses through the country.&quot;

Joined by Donald Cargill, another exile from Rotterdam, Cameron helped draw up a band (bond of mutual defence) in March 1680, which eventually carried 27 signatures of the group who formed the nucleus of his loyal following. By April the Scottish Privy Council reported to James, Duke of York, who feared Covenanter meetings as &quot;fore-runners of rebellion&quot;, that new measures were being planned against the &quot;fanatics&quot; who were &quot;running out again to field-conventicles in several parts of the kingdom&quot;.

On 22 June 1680 Cameron, accompanied by 20 followers, including David Hackston, wanted for his part in the murder of Archbishop Sharp, rode into the town of Sanquhar in Nithsdale. After singing a psalm at the cross, Michael Cameron read aloud the Sanquhar Declaration, calling for war against Charles II, denounced as a &quot;tyrant&quot;, and the exclusion of his openly Roman Catholic brother James from the succession. The Privy Council&#x27;s response on 30 June condemned the &quot;execrable paper&quot; as tantamount to a declaration of war and declared the participants &quot;open and notorious traitors and rebels&quot;. Cameron had a price of 5,000 merks placed on his head, while 3,000 merks were offered for three other identified ring-leaders of the group, including Cargill (who, because of personal reservations, had not in fact been present at Sanquar) and 1,000 merks for each for the others.

In the weeks that followed Cameron continued preaching before ever-growing crowds at various locations in the south west of Scotland. He delivered what was to be his last sermon at Kype Water, Clydesdale (modern Lanarkshire) on Sunday 18 July 1680, where he told the assembled congregation,

&quot;But we are of the opinion that the church shall yet be more high and glorious, and the church shall have more power than ever she had before; and therefore we declare avowedly in opposition to all tyrannical magistrates over Protestants and over Presbyterians, magistrates that are open enemies to God. We declare we will have none such acknowledged as lawful magistrates over us; we will have none but such as are for the advancement of piety, and the suppression of impiety and wickedness. Let all the world say as they will, we have the Word of God for it. The work begun shall be carried on in spite of all opposition; our Lord shall be exalted on earth; and we do not question much but that he shall yet be exalted in Scotland. I assure you that we in Scotland have need to take heed to ourselves. I am very much afraid that we may even have done with good days in Scotland for all this. But let us stir up ourselves, and take hold of him by faith; for I assure you, if ye be not delivered, and made a free and purified people, we shall be no more a free corporation, nation, or embodied people, than the Jews are this day. I say not this to disquiet you, but to stir you up to take hold of Christ, and his standard on which it shall be written, &#x27;Let Christ Reign&#x27;. Let us study to have it set up amongst us. It is hard to tell, where it shall be first erected; but our Lord is to set up a standard, and oh that it may be carried to Scotland! When it is set up, it shall be carried through the nations; and it shall go to Rome, and the gates of Rome shall be burnt with fire. It is a standard that shall overthrow the throne of Britain, and all the thrones in Europe, that will not kiss the Son lest he be angry, and in his anger they perish from the way.&quot;

On 22 July, accompanied by about 60 followers on horse and foot, Cameron was in east Ayrshire when government dragoons commanded by Andrew Bruce of Earlshall (&#x27;Bluidy Bruce&#x27;), acting on information received from a local laird, tracked him down at Airds Moss near Cumnock. During a bloody engagement at about four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon Cameron&#x27;s followers, who had become known as the &#x27;Hill Men&#x27;, were overwhelmed by superior numbers. Bruce&#x27;s despatch reported, &quot;The dispute continued a quarter of an hour very hot; the rebels, refusing either to fly or take quarter, fought like madmen ...&quot; Cameron was killed on the spot and Hackston taken prisoner. Cameron&#x27;s head and hands were severed from his body and taken to Edinburgh where they were shown to his father who was already imprisoned in the town&#x27;s tolbooth.

When his father was shown the head and hands of his son, he was asked &quot;Do you know them?&quot; Alan Cameron kissed his son&#x27;s head and said, &quot;I know them. I know them. They are my son&#x27;s, my own dear son&#x27;s. It is the Lord. Good is the will of the Lord, who cannot wrong me or mine, but has made goodness and mercy to follow us all our days.&quot;

After being paraded through the main street behind Cameron&#x27;s head displayed aloft on the end of a pole, Hackston was sentenced and two days later brutally executed at the cross. Cameron&#x27;s head and hands were then affixed to the Netherbow Port for public display.

The period in which these events took place was later given the name &quot;The Killing Time&quot; because hundreds, if not thousands of Presbyterians were persecuted and martyred for holding Cameronian views.

==Legacy==

In 1689, following the accession of William II and that monarch&#x27;s adoption of religious toleration (excepting Roman Catholics in positions of state), Cameron&#x27;s followers were pardoned and incorporated into the British Army as the Cameronian regiment which defeated Jacobite forces later that year in the Battle of Dunkeld. The troop was subsequently renamed the 26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot and continued to serve the British Crown until its disbandment in 1968 as part of a post-imperial reduction in the size of Britain&#x27;s armed forces.

Viewed by royalists, episcopalians and moderate presbyterians as narrow-minded zealots, the Cameronians saw themselves as emulating the early Christian martyrs by holding steadfastly to their beliefs in the face of their enemies&#x27; cruelties and contraptions of torture and execution. The &#x27;blood sacrifice&#x27; they made for the sake of their Protestant consciences exerted a strong influence on later generations of Protestant Scots and still resonates with many of their countrymen to this day. Cameron&#x27;s most recent biographer follows a tradition in seeing their struggle as one of religious and civil liberty in the face of an hereditary monarchy and therefore an early expression of republicanism.

A flavour of the religious fervour inspired by the Cameronians can be gauged from the symbolism and language of a poem, &quot;The Cameronian&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which preserved their memory long after the events described above had taken place. Its author James Hyslop was a self-taught shepherd from the Cumnock-Sanquhar area in the south west of Scotland which was the seedbed of the two Covenanter Risings of 1666 and 1679. Written by Hyslop between the ages of fourteen and eighteen and published in 1821, the poem ends with a Cameronian&#x27;s vision on the desolate moor at Airds Moss.

:When the righteous had fallen, and the combat had ended,
:A chariot of fire through the dark cloud descended;
:Its drivers were angels, on horses of whiteness,
:And its burning wheels turned upon axles of brightness;
:A seraph unfolded its doors bright and shining,
:All dazzling like gold of the seventh refining,
:And the souls that came forth out of great tribulation,
:Have mounted the chariots and steeds of salvation.
:On the arch of the rainbow the chariot is gliding,
:Through the paths of the thunder the horsemen are riding.
:Glide swiftly, bright spirits, the prize is before ye
:A crown never-fading, – a kingdom of glory!

<text>Laurentian University (), officially Laurentian University of Sudbury, is a mid-sized bilingual public university in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, incorporated on March 28, 1960. Laurentian offers a variety of undergraduate, graduate-level, and doctorate degrees. Laurentian is the largest bilingual provider of distance education in Canada. The college was formerly federated with Thornloe University, Huntington University, and the University of Sudbury. Laurentian severed the federation during 2021 insolvency proceedings, ending 60-year relationships, and triggering lawsuits.

==Overview==
The university&#x27;s campus is located on the south side of Ramsey Lake in the Bell Grove neighbourhood, just south of Greater Sudbury&#x27;s downtown core. The city&#x27;s Idylwylde golf course borders on the university campus to the west and the Lake Laurentian Conservation Area borders on the campus to the south. The Lake Laurentian Conservation Area contains a network of trails used for running, mountain biking and nordic skiing.

The school has three separate student unions. The Association des étudiantes et étudiants francophones (AEF) serves the francophone students in undergraduate programs. The Students&#x27; General Association (SGA) serves mainly the anglophone students in undergraduate programs. The Graduate Students&#x27; Association (GSA) serves all students in graduate programs.

==History==
Laurentian&#x27;s historical roots lie in the Roman Catholic church. The Collège du Sacré-Coeur was founded by the Society of Jesus in 1913. According to a plaque at the entrance to the R. D. Parker Building, the school began granting degrees in 1957 as the University of Sudbury. A university federation combining representatives from the Roman Catholic, United, and Anglican churches was incorporated as a &quot;non-denominational, bilingual institution of higher learning&quot; in 1960. The new Laurentian University held classes in the University of Sudbury facility, as well as in a variety of locations in the city, including the Sudbury Steelworkers Hall, until its current campus was opened in 1964. The federated colleges included Huntington College (United Church), University of Sudbury College (Roman Catholic, descended from the Collège du Sacré-Coeur), and Thorneloe College (Anglican) which joined in 1963. Former federated schools affiliated with Laurentian include Collège universitaire de Hearst in Hearst, Nipissing University College in North Bay, and Algoma University College in Sault Ste. Marie. 

In 2013, Laurentian launched the McEwen School of Architecture.

in 2020 Laurentian lost a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA), that sought to keep the salary of senior executives confidential.

On February 1, 2021, Laurentian University President Robert Haché confirmed that the University had filed for creditor protection. Court filings revealed that the university&#x27;s liabilities amounted to million. As part of its restructuring, the university ended its relationships with the federated schools. Two of the federated schools files lawsuits against Laurentian which were unsuccessful. On April 12, 2021, Laurentian University announced the closure of 58 undergraduate programs and 11 graduate programs spanning a diversity of subjects. As part of these closures, 116 faculty positions were terminated. In November 2022, the Auditor General of Ontario released a report on the university&#x27;s insolvency, finding that overspending on large capital projects starting in 2010 were the primary cause. It also found that the school should have sought provincial help before invoking the &quot;Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act&quot;, which is designed for private companies, not public institutions.

In March 2022, Ontario&#x27;s deputy ombudsman and French language services commissioner, Kelly Burke, released a report on the university&#x27;s cuts to French-language programs during its restructuring, finding that it failed to meet its obligations under the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot;. In response, francophone community groups have demanded the transfer of Laurentian University&#x27;s remaining French-language academic programming to a stand-alone French-language university.

==Administration==
The Board of Governors heads the university with the president. Directly to the left and right of the president is the assistant to the president, and the Laurentian University senate.

Aline Chrétien, the wife of former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, was named the university&#x27;s first chancellor on September 22, 2010. In 2013, she was succeeded by Steve Paikin, who resigned in 2021 when the university sought creditor protection.

==Program information==
===Commerce and administration===
Laurentian&#x27;s school of commerce and administration was founded in 1960. It is modeled on the University of Western Ontario&#x27;s Richard Ivey School of Business. The School of Management offers a wide variety of programs, from MBAs to honours degrees in Business Administration and Sports Administration (H.B.Comm in SPAD).

==== Sports Administration (H.B.Comm in SPAD) ====
Laurentian&#x27;s Sports Administration program is the only undergraduate sport management program in Canada that offers a business degree. In recent years, the program has achieved international accreditation which allows for more international opportunities. These opportunities include a two-week course in China, a semester abroad in Austria or France, International destinations for the final consulting trip, as well as many international internship opportunities.

===Education (B.Ed.)===
Laurentian has both English and French language education programs for teacher training.

====École des sciences de l’Éducation (Consecutive Education, French)====
In the Alphonse Raymond building, at the east end of campus, is the school &quot;École des sciences de l’éducation de l’Université Laurentienne&quot;. Named after Father Alphonse Raymond, and opened in 1974, the building houses classrooms, a cafeteria, an auditorium, a small gymnasium, and offices for more than a dozen professors, offering a variety of programs. The school offers a traditional consecutive post-grad Bachelor of Education and a newer concurrent Bachelor of Arts Education degree that can be taken full or part-time.

====School of Education (Concurrent Education, English)====
In September 2003, Laurentian began offering an English Bachelor of Education. This concurrent B.Ed. is a five-year program taken at the same time — concurrently — with an undergraduate degree commonly in Arts, Sciences or Sport and Physical Education. The primary goal of the English-language Bachelor of Education program is to foster the development of a new generation of reflective educators who employ holistic teaching approaches. The curriculum features an emphasis on equity and diversity as well as the infusion of Indigenous issues and content. At the moment, the program is offered in just two of the three areas of potential concentration: the primary/junior and junior/intermediate divisions. A new School of Education building - based on sustainable environmental principles and located across from L&#x27;École des sciences at the east end of the campus – was completed in the summer of 2008. The program requires a 75% average over one&#x27;s first four years in order to progress to the final (or Pro Year). The 75% minimum average required for entry in the final year means a nearly 80% entering grade in reality, so the annual Pro Year class (ranging from about 65 to 95 students) constitutes a rather elite cohort compared to most other Ontario concurrent programs. Many graduates have gone on to employment with both the local Sudbury boards, with other school boards across Ontario, while many others have acquired employment in Alberta, B.C., and Saskatchewan, with a significant number working overseas (particularly in Britain).

==Partnerships==
Located in a city where the major industry is mining, Laurentian has strong ties with the mining industry, and offers a program in mining engineering. The Willett Green Miller Centre, a provincial building located on campus, houses the Mining Innovation, Rehabilitation and Applied Research Corporation (MIRARCO), a not-for-profit applied research and technical service company formed through collaboration between Laurentian University and the private and public sectors, and the Mineral Exploration Research Centre (MERC), a semi-autonomous research and teaching centre whose focus is field-based, collaborative research on mineral deposits and their environments.

The university is a member of L&#x27;Association des universités de la francophonie canadienne, a network of academic institutions of the Canadian Francophonie.

On April 1, 2021, Laurentian terminated its federation agreement with Huntington University, Thorneloe University and the University of Sudbury as part of the CCAA process.

Laurentian&#x27;s Bachelor of Science in Nursing program is taught in colleges across Ontario as part of one of three agreements between colleges and the university. Graduates of these collaborate programs receive Laurentian degrees upon graduation. The Northeastern Ontario Collaborative Nursing Program (NEOCNP) is a partnership between Laurentian University, Cambrian College, Northern College, and Sault College. St. Lawrence College offers Laurentian&#x27;s Nursing Program through an agreement called the Laurentian–St. Lawrence Collaborative Nursing Program. Finally, Collège Boréal provides the Nursing program through an agreement with Laurentian University&#x27;s French-language &quot;sciences infirmières&quot; program. 

St. Lawrence College also offers Laurentian&#x27;s Bachelor of Business degree, a four-year program.

Laurentian opened a campus in Barrie, Ontario, in 2001 in partnership with Georgian College. The university shut down its Barrie operations in 2019. In 2005, Laurentian and Lakehead University jointly launched the Northern Ontario School of Medicine. However In 2021, the provincial government passed legislation severing the medical school&#x27;s ties with Laurentian and Lakehead, making it an independent university and Canada&#x27;s first stand-alone medical school.

==Student life==
===Students&#x27; General Association/Association Générale des Étudiants===
The SGA-AGÉ is the largest student union at Laurentian. It offers services in both English and French. The association is presided over by a board of directors.

In 2016, the SGA-AGE became a member of the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance.

=== Association des étudiantes et étudiants francophones/Francophone Students Association ===
The AEF is the second undergraduate student union at Laurentian. Dissatisfied with the status of the French language within the SGA-AGÉ in the early 1970s, francophone students created the AEF in 1974 to better advocate for French-language rights within the university community and beyond. Since then, it has gained representation on the university&#x27;s senate and board of governors as well as on several committees, in particular those relating directly to French-language academic programs and services.

The AEF offers services to its members typical of student unions, such as health and dental plans, a transit pass, and general support, while offering culturally and linguistically activities and programming reflecting their membership.

===Media===
The university&#x27;s campus radio station, CKLU-FM, broadcasts at 96.7 MHz on the FM band in both English and French. Its campus newspapers are &quot;Lambda&quot; in English and &quot;L&#x27;Orignal déchaîné&quot; (&quot;The Unchained Moose&quot;) in French. &quot;Lambda&quot; is a member of Canadian University Press, and CKLU is a member of the National Campus and Community Radio Association.

===Sports===
The university&#x27;s varsity teams, known as the Voyageurs, compete in basketball, soccer, rowing, cross country running, golf, curling, and Nordic skiing. There are also competitive club teams, including lacrosse and baseball, and a plethora of intramural sports programmes. The women&#x27;s basketball team have been one of the most successful in the history of the U Sports Women&#x27;s Basketball Championship, winning the title seven times. Notable alumnae of the basketball team include broadcaster Sylvia Sweeney. The varsity rowing team within its five-year history has produced a national team athlete and captured medals at both the OUA championships as well as gold medals at the Canadian University Rowing Championships.

In 2017, the women&#x27;s varsity curling team captured the OUA Curling Championship (the first for the program and first OUA team banner for the University since 2003) followed by the Curling Canada/U Sports Championship (the first for the program and first U Sports team banner for the University since 1991). The Voyageurs&#x27; women&#x27;s team followed-up their 2017 U Sports&#x27; victory with a second national U Sports title during the 2018–19 curling season. The team has since captured an additional U Sports bronze medal in 2023 and a second OUA Curling Championship in 2024.

The director of the athletic department is Peter Hellstrom.

====705 Challenge Cup====
First established as a challenge between the varsity soccer teams of two Northern Ontario universities (Laurentian vs. Nipissing), in which the winning team was awarded the Riley Gallo Cup, the rivalry expanded. Introducing the 705 Challenge Cup in 2016, the results of all regular season games between the Lakers and the Voyageurs varsity teams for men’s and women’s basketball, ice hockey and soccer, comprised the overall won-loss record in determining the annual Cup winner. The Lakers would win their first 705 Challenge Cup during the 2019-20 athletics season.

<text>Meyer Harris &quot;Mickey&quot; Cohen (September 4, 1913 – July 29, 1976) was an American gangster based in Los Angeles and boss of the Cohen crime family during the mid-20th century.

==Early life==
Mickey Cohen was born on September 4, 1913, in New York City to Jewish parents. Cohen&#x27;s parents immigrated to the US from Kiev. He was first raised in New York, moving with his mother and siblings to the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles at an early age. At 8, he earned money as a newsboy, selling newspapers on the street. One of his brothers, either Louie or Harry, would drop Mickey off at his regular corner, Soto and Brooklyn Streets (now Cesar E. Chavez Avenue). In 1922, Mickey was sent to reform school for petty crimes including shoplifting and theft.

==Boxing career==
As a teenager, Cohen began boxing in illegal prize fights in Los Angeles. In 1929, the 15-year-old moved from Los Angeles to Cleveland to train as a professional boxer with the alias of &#x27;Irish Mickey Cohen&#x27;. His first professional boxing match was on April 8, 1930, against Patsy Farr in Cleveland. It was one of the preliminary fights on the card for the Paul Pirrone versus Jimmy Goodrich feature bout. In a match on June 12, 1931, Cohen fought and lost against future world featherweight champion Tommy Paul. Cohen was knocked out cold after 2:20 into the first round. It was during this contest that he earned the moniker &quot;Gangster Mickey Cohen&quot;. On April 11, 1933, Cohen fought against Chalky Wright in Los Angeles. Wright won the match, and Mickey was incorrectly identified as &quot;Mickey Cohen from Denver, Colorado&quot; in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; sports page report. His last fight was on May 14, 1933, against Baby Arizmendi in Tijuana, Mexico. He finished his career at 8-8 and 5 draws – 8 wins, 2 by knockout, 8 losses, 4 losses by knockout and 5 draws.

==Criminal career==
In Cleveland, Cohen met Lou Rothkopf, an associate of gangster Moe Dalitz. Cohen later moved to New York, where he became an associate of labor racketeer Johnny Dio&#x27;s brother, Tommy Dioguardi, and as well as Owney Madden.

===Prohibition and the Chicago Outfit===

During Prohibition, Cohen moved to Chicago and became involved in organized crime, working as an enforcer for the Chicago Outfit, where he briefly met Al Capone. During this period, Cohen was arrested for his role in the deaths of several gangsters in a card game.

After a brief time in prison, Cohen was released and began running card games and other illegal gambling operations. He later became an associate of Capone&#x27;s younger brother, Mattie Capone. While working for Jake Guzik, Cohen was forced to flee Chicago after an argument with a rival gambler.

In Cleveland, Cohen worked once more for Lou Rothkopf, an associate of Meyer Lansky and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel. However, there was little work available for Cohen in Cleveland, so Lansky and Rothkopf arranged for Cohen to work with Siegel in Los Angeles.

===From syndicate bodyguard to Sunset Strip kingpin===
In 1939, Cohen arrived in Los Angeles to work under Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel, a sitting boss of the National Crime Syndicate. During their association, Cohen helped set up the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas and ran its sports book operation. He also was instrumental in setting up the race wire, which was essential to Vegas betting. During this time, Cohen met prostitute Lavonne Weaver (working alias Simoni King), and the couple married in 1940. Serving as the Best Man at his wedding was one of his associates William &quot;Stumpy&quot; Zevon, who was later the father of the American rock singer-songwriter Warren Zevon.

In 1942, while serving a six-month sentence for bookmaking, Cohen beat up Nazi sympathizers Robert Noble and Ellis Jones, who were under indictment for sedition, after the former made anti-Semitic remarks against him.

In 1947, the crime families ordered the murder of Siegel due to his mismanagement of the Flamingo Hotel Casino, most likely because Siegel or his girlfriend Virginia Hill was skimming money. According to one account which does not appear in newspapers, Cohen reacted violently to Siegel&#x27;s murder. Entering the Hotel Roosevelt, where he believed the killers were staying, Cohen fired rounds from his two .45 caliber semi-automatic handguns into the lobby ceiling and demanded that the assassins meet him outside in 10 minutes. However, no one appeared, and Cohen was forced to flee when the police arrived.

Cohen&#x27;s violent methods came to the attention of state and federal authorities investigating Jack Dragna&#x27;s operations. During this time, Cohen faced many attempts on his life, including the bombing of his home on posh Moreno Avenue in Brentwood. Cohen soon converted his house into a fortress, installing floodlights, alarm systems, and a well-equipped arsenal kept, as he often joked, next to his 200 tailor-made suits. Cohen briefly hired Johnny Stompanato as bodyguard. However, in 1958 Stompanato was killed in self-defense by Cheryl Crane, the daughter of actress Lana Turner (whom he had been dating). Cohen covered the expense of Stompanato&#x27;s funeral and then gave Turner&#x27;s love letters to Stompanato to the press in an attempt to discredit the worst allegations of threats and violence that Crane had alleged she suffered at the hands of the violent, womanizing Stompanato.

==Later years==

In 1950, Cohen was investigated along with many other underworld figures by a U.S. Senate committee known as the Kefauver Commission. As a result of this investigation, Cohen was convicted of tax evasion in June 1951 and sentenced to prison for four years.

Ben Hecht stated in his autobiography, &quot;A Child of the Century&quot;, that Cohen called him to say he wanted to do his part in helping Hecht raise money to support Menachem Begin&#x27;s Irgun in its activities. Cohen called together a parlor meeting of business associates and had Hecht address them on the importance of the cause. Each person was then asked to call out a sum he would donate. In some cases, Cohen told a donor &quot;that&#x27;s not enough,&quot; and they upped the pledge. Later, when Cohen was arrested, he called Hecht from prison to ask if he had access to some cash to help with his bail. When Hecht apologized, Cohen politely said goodbye, and they never spoke again.

When he was released in October 1955, he became an international celebrity. He ran floral shops, paint stores, nightclubs, casinos, gas stations, a men&#x27;s haberdashery, and even drove an ice cream van on San Vicente Boulevard in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, according to author Richard Lamparski.

In 1957, &quot;TIME&quot; magazine wrote a brief article about Cohen&#x27;s meeting with Christian evangelist Billy Graham. Cohen said: &quot;I am very high on the Christian way of life. Billy came up, and before we had food he said—What do you call it, that thing they say before food? Grace? Yeah, grace. Then we talked a lot about Christianity and stuff.&quot; Allegedly when Cohen did not change his lifestyle, he was confronted by Christian acquaintances. His response: &quot;Christian football players, Christian cowboys, Christian politicians; why not a Christian gangster?&quot;
In 1961, Cohen was again convicted of tax evasion and sent to Alcatraz. He was the only prisoner ever bailed out of Alcatraz; his bond was signed by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren. After his appeals failed, Cohen was sent to a federal prison in Atlanta, Georgia. His heavily armored Cadillac from this period was confiscated by the Los Angeles Police Department and is now on display at the Southward Car Museum in New Zealand. On August 14, 1963, during his time at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, inmate Burl Estes McDonald attempted to kill Cohen with a lead pipe. In 1972, Cohen was released from the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, where he had spoken out against prison abuse. He had been misdiagnosed with an ulcer, which turned out to be stomach cancer. After undergoing surgery, he continued touring the United States and made television appearances, once with Ramsey Clark.

===Death===
Cohen died at age 62, of complications from stomach cancer surgery in July 1976.
He is interred in Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

Also, he is sentenced to life imprisonment, when in real life, Cohen was eventually released from custody and died of stomach cancer. It was also implied at the end of the film that Cohen was beaten to death with a lead pipe when he was sent to Alcatraz by acquaintances of the man he killed.

<text>The Order of National Artists of the Philippines (Tagalog: &quot;Orden ng mga Pambansang Alagad ng Sining ng Pilipinas&quot;) is an order bestowed by the President of the Philippines on Philippine nationals who have made significant contributions to the development of Philippine art. Members of the order are known as National Artists. Originally instituted as an award, it was elevated to the status of an order in 2003.

The order is administered by the Cultural Center of the Philippines by virtue of President Ferdinand Marcos&#x27;s Proclamation No. 1001 of April 2, 1972, and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. The first award was posthumously conferred on Filipino painter Fernando Amorsolo.

==Definition==
The order of the highest state honor is conferred on individuals deemed as having done much for their artistic field. Deserving individuals must have been recommended by both the Cultural Center and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts prior to receiving the award. Such people are then titled, by virtue of a Presidential Proclamation, as &quot;National Artist&quot; (Filipino: &quot;Gawad Pambansang Alagad ng Sining&quot;), and are inducted into the order.

==Categories==
Categories under which National Artists can be recognized originally included:
*Music – singing, composition, direction, and/or performance;
*Dance – choreography, direction and/or performance;
*Theater – direction, performance and/or production design;
*Contemporary Arts – painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, installation art, mixed media works, illustration, graphic arts, performance art and/or imaging;
*Literature – poetry, fiction, essay, playwriting, journalism and/or literary criticism;
*Film and Broadcasting/Broadcast Arts – direction, writing, production design, cinematography, editing, camera work, and/or performance; and
*Architecture, Design and Allied Arts – architecture design, interior design, industrial arts design, landscape architecture and fashion design.

However, National Artists have since been honored under new categories. The NCCA created the category of National Artist for Fashion Design when it nominated Ramon Valera, but subsumed that category under &quot;Architecture, Design and Allied Arts&quot;. President Fidel V. Ramos issued an executive order creating the category of National Artist for Historical Literature before conferring the honor to Carlos Quirino.

==Criteria==
The National Artists of the Philippines is based on broad criteria, as set forth by the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the National Commission on Culture and the Arts:
# Living artists who have been Filipino citizens for the last ten years prior to nomination as well as those who have died after the establishment of the Award in 1972 but were Filipino citizens at the time of their death;
# Artists who have helped build a Filipino sense of nationhood through the content and form of their works;
# Artists who have distinguished themselves by pioneering in a mode of creative expression or style, making an impact on succeeding generations of artists;
# Artists who have created a significant body of works and/or have consistently displayed excellence in the practice of their art form, enriching artistic expression or style; and
# Artists who enjoy broad acceptance through prestigious national and/or international recognition, Award in prestigious national and/or international events, critical acclaim and/or reviews of their works, and/or respect and esteem from peers within an artistic discipline.

Nominations are then submitted to the National Artist Secretariat which is created by the National Artist Award Committee; experts from different art fields then sit on a First Deliberation to prepare the short list of nominees. A Second Deliberation, which is a joint meeting of the Commissioners of the NCCA and the Board of Trustees of the CCP, decides on the final nominees. The list is then forwarded to the President of the Philippines, who, by Presidential Proclamation, proclaims the final nominees as members of the Order of National Artists.

==Benefits==
*The rank and title of National Artist, as proclaimed by the President of the Philippines;
*A grand collar of the Order of National Artist and a citation;
*A lifetime emolument and material and physical benefits comparable in value to those received by the highest officers of the land such as:
:#a cash Award of one hundred thousand pesos (₱100,000.00) net of taxes, for living awardees;
:#a cash Award of seventy-five thousand pesos (₱75,000.00) net of taxes, for posthumous awardees, payable to legal heir/s;
:#a monthly life pension, medical and hospitalization benefits;
:#life insurance coverage for Awardees who are still insurable;
:#a state funeral and burial at the &quot;Libingan ng mga Bayani&quot;;
:#a place of honor, in line with protocolar precedence, at national state functions, and recognition at cultural events.

==2009 National Artist of the Philippines controversy==
In August 2009, the conferment of the Order of National Artists on seven individuals by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo became controversial when it was revealed that musician Ramon Santos had been dropped from the list of nominees short-listed in May that year by the selection committee, and that four other individuals had been nominated via &quot;President&#x27;s prerogative&quot;: Cecile Guidote-Alvarez (Theater), Carlo J. Caparas (Visual Arts and Film), Francisco Mañosa (Architecture), and Pitoy Moreno (Fashion Design).

Members of the Philippine art community–including a number of living members of the Order–protested that the proclamation politicised the title of National Artist, and made it &quot;a way for President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to accommodate her allies.&quot; Specific protests were raised regarding the nomination of Guidote-Alvarez, who was also executive director of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, because it was purportedly a breach of protocol and &quot;delicadeza&quot; (propriety), and of Caparas, on the grounds that he was unqualified for nomination under both the Visual Arts and the Film categories. On July 16, 2013, the controversy finally ended after the Supreme Court of the Philippines voted 12-1-2 that voided the four proclamations.

On June 20, 2014, five years after he was originally shortlisted in 2009, Ramon Santos was finally conferred National Artist for Music by President Benigno S. Aquino III.

<doc id="342028" wikidata="Q1056625" url="?curid=342028" title="Convertible bond">
<text>In finance, a convertible bond, convertible note, or convertible debt (or a convertible debenture if it has a maturity of greater than 10 years) is a type of bond that the holder can convert into a specified number of shares of common stock in the issuing company or cash of equal value. It is a hybrid security with debt- and equity-like features. It originated in the mid-19th century, and was used by early speculators such as Jacob Little and Daniel Drew to counter market cornering.

Convertible bonds are most often issued by companies with a low credit rating and high growth potential. Convertible bonds are also considered debt security because the companies agree to give fixed or floating interest rate as they do in common bonds for the funds of investor. To compensate for having additional value through the option to convert the bond to stock, a convertible bond typically has a coupon rate lower than that of similar, non-convertible debt. The investor receives the potential upside of conversion into equity while protecting downside with cash flow from the coupon payments and the return of principal upon maturity. These properties—and the fact that convertible bonds trade often below fair value—lead naturally to the idea of convertible arbitrage, where a long position in the convertible bond is balanced by a short position in the underlying equity.

From the issuer&#x27;s perspective, the key benefit of raising money by selling convertible bonds is a reduced cash interest payment. The advantage for companies of issuing convertible bonds is that, if the bonds are converted to stocks, companies&#x27; debt vanishes. However, in exchange for the benefit of reduced interest payments, the value of shareholder&#x27;s equity is reduced due to the stock dilution expected when bondholders convert their bonds into new shares.

Convertible notes are also a frequent vehicle for seed investing in startup companies, as a form of debt that converts to equity in a future investing round. It is a hybrid investment vehicle, which carries the (limited) protection of debt at the start, but shares in the upside as equity if the startup is successful, while avoiding the necessity of valuing the company at too early a stage.

==Types==
Although no formal classification exists in the financial market it is possible to segment convertibles into the following sub-types:

===Vanilla convertible bonds===
Vanilla convertible bonds are the most plain convertible structures. They grant the holder the right to convert into a certain number of shares determined according to a conversion price determined in advance. They may offer coupon regular payments during the life of the security and have a fixed maturity date where the nominal value of the bond is redeemable by the holder. This type is the most common convertible type and is typically providing the asymmetric returns profile and positive convexity often wrongly associated to the entire asset class: at maturity the holder would indeed either convert into shares or request the redemption at par depending on whether or not the stock price is above the conversion price.

===Mandatory convertibles===
Mandatory convertibles are a common variation of the vanilla subtype, especially on the US market. Mandatory convertible would force the holder to convert into shares at maturity—hence the term &quot;Mandatory&quot;. Those securities would very often bear two conversion prices, making their profiles similar to a &quot;risk reversal&quot; option strategy. The first conversion price would limit the price where the investor would receive the equivalent of its par value back in shares, the second would delimit where the investor will earn more than par. If the stock price is below the first conversion price the investor would suffer a capital loss compared to its original investment (excluding the potential coupon payments). Mandatory convertibles can be compared to forward selling of equity at a premium.

===Reverse convertibles===
Reverse convertibles are a less common variation, mostly issued synthetically. They would be opposite of the vanilla structure: the conversion price would act as a knock-in short put option: as the stock price drops below the conversion price the investor would start to be exposed the underlying stock performance and no longer able to redeem at par its bond. This negative convexity would be compensated by a usually high regular coupon payment.

===Packaged convertibles===
Packaged convertibles or sometimes &quot;bond + option&quot; structures are simply a straight bond and a call option/warrant wrapped together. Usually the investor would be able to then trade both legs separately. Although the initial payoff is similar to a plain vanilla one, the Packaged Convertibles would then have different dynamics and risks associated with them since at maturity the holder would not receive some cash or shares but some cash and potentially some share. They would for instance miss the modified duration mitigation effect usual with plain vanilla convertibles structures.

===Contingent convertibles===

Contingent convertibles are a variation of the mandatory convertibles. They are automatically converted into equity if a pre-specified trigger event occurs, for example if the value of assets is below the value of its guaranteed debt.

===Foreign currency convertibles===

Foreign currency convertibles are any convertible bonds whose face value is issued in a currency different from issuing company&#x27;s domestic currency.

===Exchangeable bond===
Exchangeable bond where the issuing company and the underlying stock company are different companies (e.g. XS0882243453, GBL into GDF Suez). This distinction is usually made in terms of risk i.e. equity and credit risk being correlated: in some cases the entities would be legally distinct, but not considered as exchangeable as the ultimate guarantor being the same as the underlying stock company (e.g. typical in the case of the Sukuk, Islamic convertible bonds, needing a specific legal setup to be compliant with the Islamic law).

===Synthetic bond===
Synthetically structured convertible bond issued by an investment bank to replicate a convertible payoff on a specific underlying equity. Sometimes referred also as Cash settled Bank Exchangeable Bonds (e.g. Barclays/MSFT 25 US06738G8A15 - Barclays Bank PLC is the issuer while Microsoft is the referenced underlying equity). Most reverse convertibles are synthetics. Synthetics are more similar to structured products with settlement done in cash and no equities being produced as the result of a conversion. The Packaged Convertibles (e.g. Siemens 17 DE000A1G0WA1) are sometimes confused with synthetics due to the fact an issuer (sometime a portfolio manager) will create a structure using straight bonds and options. There are in reality two completely different products with different risks and payoffs.

==Structure, features and terminology==
*Coupon: Periodic interest payment paid to the convertible bond holder from the issuer. Could be fixed or variable or equal to zero.
*Maturity/redemption date: The date on which the principal (par value) of the bond (and all remaining interest) are due to be paid. In some cases, for non-vanilla convertible bonds, there is no maturity date (i.e. perpetual), this is often the case with preferred convertibles (e.g. US0605056821).
*Final conversion date: Final date at which the holder can request the conversion into shares. Might be different from the redemption date.
*Yield: Yield of the convertible bond at the issuance date, could be different from the coupon value if the bond is offering a premium redemption. In those cases the yield value would determine the premium redemption value and intermediary put redemption value.
* Bond floor: Also known as straight bond value, this is the value of a convertible bond&#x27;s fixed income elements (regular interest payments, payment of principal at maturity and a superior claim on assets compared to common stock) excluding the ability to convert into equities.
* The issuance prospectus will state either a conversion ratio or a conversion price. The conversion ratio is the number of shares the investor receives when exchanging the bond for common stock. The conversion price is the price paid per share to acquire the shares when exchanging the bond for common stock.
* Market conversion price: The price that the convertible investor effectively pays for the right to convert to common stock. It is calculated as shown below. Once the actual market price of the underlying stock exceeds the market conversion price embedded in the convertible, any further rise in the stock price will drive up the convertible security&#x27;s price by at least the same percentage. Thus, the market conversion price can be thought of as a &quot;break-even point.&quot;

<doc id="342031" wikidata="Q4388292" url="?curid=342031" title="Arthur Vandenberg">
<text>Arthur Hendrick Vandenberg Sr. (March 22, 1884April 18, 1951) was an American politician who served as a United States senator from Michigan from 1928 to 1951. A member of the Republican Party, he participated in the creation of the United Nations. He is best known for leading the Republican Party from a foreign policy of isolationism to one of internationalism, and supporting the Cold War, the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and NATO. He served as president pro tempore of the United States Senate from 1947 to 1949.

Born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in a family of Dutch Americans, Vandenberg began his career as a newspaper editor and publisher. In 1928, Republican Governor Fred W. Green appointed Vandenberg to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy that arose after the death of Woodbridge N. Ferris. Vandenberg won election to a full term later that year and remained in the Senate until his death in 1951. He supported the early New Deal programs but came to oppose most of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s domestic policies. During the late 1930s, Vandenberg also opposed the United States&#x27; becoming involved in World War II and urged Roosevelt to reach an accommodation with Japan.

Vandenberg abandoned his isolationism after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1947 and supported Democratic President Harry Truman&#x27;s Cold War policies, asserting that &quot;politics stops at the water&#x27;s edge.&quot; Vandenberg also served as the chairman of the Republican Senate Conference from 1945 to 1947 and as the president pro tempore of the Senate from 1947 to 1949. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for president in 1940 and 1948.

==Early life and family==
Vandenberg was born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the son of Alpha (née Hendrick) and Aaron Vandenberg, of mostly Dutch heritage. Vandenberg attended the public schools of Grand Rapids and graduated from Grand Rapids Central High School in June 1900 ranked first in his class. He then studied law at the University of Michigan (1900–1901), where he was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. After a brief stint working in New York at &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; magazine, he returned home in 1906 to marry his childhood sweetheart, Elizabeth Watson. They had three children. She died in 1917, and in 1918 Vandenberg married Hazel Whitaker. They had no children.

From 1906 to 1928, he worked as a newspaper editor and publisher at the &quot;Grand Rapids Herald&quot;. It was owned by William Alden Smith, who served as a Republican in the U.S. Senate from 1907 to 1919. As publisher, Vandenberg made the paper highly profitable. He wrote most of the editorials, many of which called for more Progressivism in the spirit of his hero Theodore Roosevelt. He supported incumbent President William Howard Taft over Roosevelt in the 1912 election. In 1915 Vandenberg coined the term &quot;loon ship&quot; for Henry Ford&#x27;s Peace Ship in reaction to Ford&#x27;s more outlandish ideas.

A talented public speaker, during political campaigns Vandenberg often gave speeches on behalf of Republican candidates. He also attended numerous local, county and state Republican conventions as a delegate, and gave several convention keynote addresses. His work on behalf of the party gave Vandenberg a high public profile, and he was frequently mentioned as a candidate for governor or other offices.

As a widower with three small children, Vandenberg was ineligible for active military service during World War I. To contribute to the war effort, Vandenberg gave speeches at hundreds of Liberty bond rallies in Michigan and Ohio, in which he urged listeners to demonstrate their patriotism by helping finance U.S. military preparedness and combat. In addition, he joined the Michigan State Troops, the volunteer organization that performed many of the National Guard&#x27;s duties after the Guard was federalized. Appointed a first lieutenant, Vandenberg commanded a company in Grand Rapids until the end of the war. After the war, Vandenberg aided in founding and organizing the Michigan branch of the American Legion.

Vandenberg gained national attention for his 1921 biography &quot;The Greatest American: Alexander Hamilton&quot;. He followed this in 1923 with &quot;If Hamilton Were Here Today: American Fundamentals Applied to Modern Problems&quot;; and, in 1926, &quot;The Trail of a Tradition&quot;, a study of American nationalism and U.S. foreign policy.

A civic activist, Vandenberg&#x27;s fraternal memberships included Masons, Shriners, Elks, and Woodmen of the World.

==Senate career 1928–1935==

On March 31, 1928, Governor Fred W. Green appointed 44-year-old Vandenberg to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Woodbridge N. Ferris, a Democrat. Green considered resigning so he could be appointed to the vacancy. He also considered several other candidates, including former governors Albert Sleeper and Chase Osborn. In addition, Green considered Representative Joseph W. Fordney, who would have been a placeholder until the election for the remainder of Ferris&#x27; term. Green finally decided upon Vandenberg, who immediately declared his intention to stand for election to both the short, unexpired term and the full six-year term.

He became the fifth former journalist then serving in the U.S. Senate. Governor Green &quot;stressed the advantage of youth as a qualification for the rough-and-tumble of life in Washington committee rooms&quot; which was deemed an explanation for appointing Vandenberg over the aged Fordney. &quot;Fellow Republican publishers to whom he can look from behind his horn-rimmed glasses for encouragement in his maiden speech are Cutting of New Mexico, Capper of Kansas, La Follette of Wisconsin. Senator-publisher Carter Glass of Virginia sits across the aisle among the Democrats.&quot;

In November 1928, Vandenberg was handily elected for a full term, defeating Democratic challenger John W. Bailey with over 70% of the vote. In the Senate, he piloted into law the Reapportionment Act of 1929, which updated the process for redistricting of the House of Representatives after each national census and capped the number of representatives at 435. He was at first an ardent supporter of Republican President Herbert Hoover but he became discouraged by Hoover&#x27;s intransigence, and failures in dealing with the Great Depression.

After the election of Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt to the presidency in 1932, Vandenberg went along with most of the early New Deal measures, except for the National Industrial Recovery Act and Agricultural Adjustment Act. With the exception of his amendment to the 1933 Glass–Steagall Banking Act, that created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Vandenberg failed to secure enactment of any significant legislative proposals. By the 1934 election, though his own political position was precarious, he was still reelected over Democratic candidate Frank Albert Picard by 52,443 votes.

==Opposing the New Deal 1935–1939==
When the new Congress convened in 1935, there were only 25 Republican senators, and Vandenberg was one of the most effective opponents of the second New Deal. He voted against most Roosevelt-sponsored measures, notable exceptions being the Banking Act of 1935 and the Social Security Act. He pursued a policy of what he called fiscal responsibility, a balanced budget, states&#x27; rights, and reduced taxation. He felt that Franklin Roosevelt had usurped the powers of Congress, and he spoke of the dictatorship of Roosevelt. But at the 1936 Republican National Convention, Vandenberg refused to permit the party to nominate him for vice president, anticipating Roosevelt&#x27;s victory that year.

As part of the conservative coalition of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, Vandenberg helped defeat Roosevelt&#x27;s plan to pack the Supreme Court. He helped defeat the Passamaquoddy Bay tidal power and Florida Canal projects, voted against the National Labor Relations Act, various New Deal tax measures, and the Hours and Wages Act.

==American foreign policy==
Vandenberg became a member of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1929. Starting as an internationalist, he voted in favor of United States membership on the World Court. However, the war clouds gathering in Europe moved him towards isolationism. His experiences during the Nye Committee hearings on the munitions industry, of which he was the Senate co-sponsor, convinced him that entry into World War I had been a disastrous error.

He supported the isolationist Neutrality Acts of the 1930s but wanted and sponsored more severe bills designed to renounce all traditional neutral &quot;rights&quot; and restrict and prevent any action by the president that might cause the United States to be drawn into war. He was one of the most effective of the diehard isolationists in the Senate. Except for advocating aid to Finland after the Soviet invasion of that country and urging a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; in the Far East to prevent a war with Japan over the Manchuria-China question, his position was consistently isolationist.

In mid-1939 he introduced legislation nullifying the 1911 Treaty of Navigation and Commerce with Japan and urged that the administration negotiate a new treaty with Japan recognizing the status quo with regard to Japan&#x27;s occupation of Chinese territory. Instead, Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull used the resolution as a pretext for giving Japan the required six months&#x27; notice of intent to cancel the treaty. On the day of the Pearl Harbor attack his position changed radically. In his private papers he wrote that at Pearl Harbor, isolationism died for any realist. In the end, only one member of Congress, Republican Jeannette Rankin, voted against war with Japan.

==United Nations and internationalism 1940–1950==

In the election of 1940, Vandenberg secured a third term in the Senate by defeating Democratic challenger Frank Fitzpatrick by over 100,000 votes. During World War II, Vandenberg&#x27;s position on American foreign policy changed radically. Although he continued to vote with the conservative coalition against Roosevelt&#x27;s domestic proposals, Vandenberg gradually abandoned his isolationism to become an architect of a bipartisan foreign policy, which he defined as a consensus developed by consultation between the president, the State Department, and congressional leaders from both parties, especially those in the Senate.

In 1943, British scholar Isaiah Berlin, working for the British embassy, prepared a confidential intelligence summary of the leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He described Vandenberg as: 

On January 10, 1945, he delivered a celebrated &quot;speech heard round the world&quot; in the Senate Chamber, publicly announcing his conversion from &quot;isolationism&quot; to &quot;internationalism&quot;. Following the completion of the Second World War, Vandenberg was elected to his fourth and final term in the U.S. Senate, defeating his Democratic challenger, James H. Lee, by earning over two-thirds of the vote in the 1946 election. In 1947, at the start of the Cold War, Vandenberg became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In that position, he cooperated with the Truman administration in forging bipartisan support for the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and NATO, including presenting the critical Vandenberg resolution.

As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he asserted that &quot;politics stops at the water&#x27;s edge&quot;, and cooperated with the Truman administration in forging bipartisan support, distinguishing himself as a &quot;leader of the &#x27;loyal opposition&#x27;&quot;. Francis O. Wilcox, first chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, recalled Vandenberg&#x27;s Senate career as an exemplar of bipartisanship in American foreign policy. In October 2000, the Senate bestowed a rare honor on Vandenberg, voting to include his portrait in a &quot;very select collection&quot; in the United States Senate Reception Room.

==Last years==

In 1940 and 1948 Vandenberg was a &quot;favorite son&quot; candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. In 1950 Vandenberg announced that he had developed cancer. He died on April 18, 1951, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Grand Rapids.

==Legacy==
The former Vandenberg Creative Arts Academy of the Grand Rapids Public Schools was named after him.

In September 2004, a portrait of Vandenberg, along with one of Senator Robert F. Wagner, was unveiled in the Senate Reception Room. The two new portraits joined a group of highly distinguished senators including Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Robert M. La Follette, and Robert A. Taft. Portraits of this group of senators, known as the &quot;Famous Five&quot;, had been unveiled in March 1959. A statue dedicated to Vandenberg was unveiled in May 2005 in downtown Grand Rapids, on Monroe Street, north of Rosa Parks Circle.

Senator Vandenberg is memorialized in a two-sided Michigan historical marker at the Arthur Hendrick Vandenberg Center governmental complex in Grand Rapids; one side honors the center and the other honors Vandenberg personally.

The Vandenberg Room (formerly the Grand Rapids Room) at the University of Michigan is named in honor of Senator Vandenberg&#x27;s second wife, Hazel.

Vandenberg Hall at Oakland University is named in his honor.

In southeast Michigan, three elementary schools were named after him: one in Redford, another in Southfield, and the third in Wayne, which closed in 2016.

==Noteworthy family members==
Arthur H. Vandenberg Jr. (1907–1968), the senator&#x27;s son, worked for the senator for more than a decade. In 1952 President Eisenhower appointed him appointments secretary, but he took a leave of absence before Eisenhower was inaugurated.

Senator Vandenberg&#x27;s nephew, U.S. Air Force General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, served as Air Force Chief of Staff and director of Central Intelligence. Vandenberg Air Force Base was named in his honor.

Senator Vandenberg&#x27;s great nephew, Hoyt S. Vandenberg Jr., served as a major general in the Air Force.

<text>Arleta () is a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of the city of Los Angeles, California. It contains a high percentage of Latino residents and of people born outside the United States.

==Geography==
Arleta is bordered by the Los Angeles districts of Mission Hills and North Hills on the north, Sun Valley on the east, Pacoima on the northeast, and Panorama City on the west. It lies within the 6th City Council district.

The boundaries of Arleta are roughly Paxton Avenue on the northwest, Laurel Canyon Boulevard on the northeast, Tonopah Avenue on the southeast, and Woodman Avenue on the southwest, making the square area about , according to Google Earth.

== History ==
The area of Arleta was a relatively undeveloped portion in the west of the community of Pacoima. This area remained semirural up to World War II when manufacturers expanded their operations into the valley and created more jobs. In order to accommodate factory workers, residential development increased in the area.

Most of Pacoima developed into a multiethnic neighborhood with a significant population of African-American and Latino residents, whereas the western portion remained primarily white. The 5 Freeway was built in the early 1960s and created a physical barrier between east and west Pacoima, and in the same period, residents in the western half led a petition and successfully broke from the neighborhood to form Arleta; the new neighborhood was officially recognized in 1968.

As industrial jobs began to decrease in the valley, many residents left the area in the 1980&#x27;s; following this, Arleta became much more diverse and as of the 2010s, it shares the majority Latino demographics of Pacoima.

==Demographics==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 31,068 residents in the Arleta neighborhood—or 10,034 people per square mile, an average population density for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 32,622. In 2000 the median age for residents was 29, about average for city neighborhoods. The percentage of residents aged 11 to 18 was among the county&#x27;s highest.

The neighborhood was considered &quot;moderately diverse&quot; ethnically within Los Angeles, with a relatively high percentage of Latinos. The breakdown was Latinos, 71.7%; Asians, 11.0%; whites, 13.2%; blacks, 2.2%; and others, 1.9%. Mexico (55.3%) and El Salvador (11.2%) were the most common places of birth for the 46% of the residents who were born abroad—which was a high percentage for Los Angeles.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $65,649, considered average for the city. Renters occupied 19.6% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 80.4%. The average household size of 4.0 people was considered high for Los Angeles. The 11.5% of families headed by single parents was considered about average for city neighborhoods.

<text>Wilmington is a neighborhood in the South Bay and Harbor region of Los Angeles, California, covering .

Featuring a heavy concentration of industry and the third-largest oil field in the continental United States, this neighborhood has a high percentage of Latino and foreign-born residents. Nearly 20 percent of Wilmington’s total land area is taken up by oil refineries — roughly 3.5 times more area than is dedicated to open and accessible green spaces. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wilmington had one of the highest death rates in all of Los Angeles County, exacerbated by elevated levels of industrial pollution.

It is the site of Banning High School, and ten other primary and secondary schools. Wilmington has six parks.

Wilmington was part of a 1784 Spanish land grant. It became a separate city in 1863, and it joined the city of Los Angeles in 1909. Places of interest include the headquarters U.S. Army for Southern California and the Drum Barracks built to protect the nascent Los Angeles harbor during the American Civil War.

==Geography==

Wilmington shares borders with Carson to the north, Long Beach to the east, San Pedro to the south and west and Harbor City to the northwest.

==Demographics==
A total of 53,815 people were living within Wilmington&#x27;s 9.14 square miles, according to the 2010 U.S. census—averaging 5,887 people per square mile, among the lowest population densities in the city as a whole. The median age was 28. The percentages of people from birth through age 34 were among the county&#x27;s highest. Population was estimated at 54,512 in 2008.

Wilmington is not considered very diverse ethnically, with a diversity index of 0.245. In 2000, Latinos made up 86.6% of the population, while non-Hispanic whites were at 6.4%, Asians at 4.8%, blacks at 2.6% and others at 1.7%. Mexico and Guatemala were the most common places of birth for the 44.5% of the residents who were born abroad, considered a high percentage of foreign-born when compared with the city and the county as a whole.

The $40,627 median household income in 2008 dollars was average for the city. Renters occupied 61.5% of the housing units, with homeowners occupying the rest. In 2000 there were 1,524 military veterans, or 4.6% of the population, relatively low in comparison to the city and county as a whole.

There is a Mexican-American community in Wilmington.

==History==
The area that is now Wilmington was inhabited by the Tongva people of Native Americans. Archeological work in the nearby Chowigna excavation show evidence of inhabitants as far back as 7,100 years ago.

The Spanish Empire expanded into this area when the Viceroy of New Spain commissioned Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo to explore the Pacific Ocean in 1542–1543. In 1784, the Spanish Crown deeded Rancho San Pedro, a tract of over in the area, to retired soldier Juan José Domínguez, for his service with the Portolà expedition into the area over a decade earlier.

Phineas Banning acquired the land that would become Wilmington from Manuel Dominguez, grand nephew and heir to Juan José Domínguez, in 1858 to build a harbor for the city of Los Angeles. Known as New San Pedro from 1858 to 1863, it was subsequently renamed Wilmington by Banning, a.k.a. “Father of the Harbor”, after his birthplace, Wilmington, Delaware.

In 1861, at the beginning of the Civil War, Banning and Benjamin Wilson gave the federal government 60 acres of land to build Drum Barracks to protect the nascent Los Angeles harbor from Confederate attack.

Wilmington was a township in the 1870 census. The township consisted of the present-day South Bay communities, Compton, western Long Beach, parts of Rattlesnake Island and Mormon Island which later evolved into Terminal Island. Census records report a population of 942 in 1870. The township had been named San Pedro Township in 1860.

Wilson College, precursor to the University of Southern California, opened in Wilmington in 1874 as the first coeducational college west of the Mississippi.

Los Angeles annexed Wilmington in 1909, and today it and neighboring San Pedro form the waterfront of one of the world&#x27;s largest import/export centers. Citizens of Wilmington were dubious that annexation would be in their best interests, fearing that it would shift economic activity out of their city and towards Los Angeles. Because the city government of Los Angeles so strongly wanted to have the growing port inside the city limits, it made a number of promises to Wilmington and also to the equally-dubious citizens of the-then independent city of San Pedro. Among these promises were that $10 million would be invested in improvements to the port and that as much would be spent inside the city on public works as was collected in taxes.

In the 1920s, William Wrigley Jr. built innovative housing in Wilmington that was dubbed the “Court of Nations.”
Wilmington is adjacent to the Wilmington Oil Field, discovered in 1932. It is the third largest oil field in the continental United States. Consequently, there are at least 8 major refineries in the Wilmington area, many of them dating back to the original strike.

During World War II the United States Military operated the Los Angeles Port of Embarkation in Wilmington, from which soldiers and sailors were sent abroad to battle zones. The LAPE was controlled by the San Francisco Port of Embarkation from its inception in 1942 until late 1943 when it became autonomous. The California Shipbuilding Corporation, known for building victory ships during the war (although usually associated with Terminal Island), operated in Wilmington as well.

==Points of interest==

Decorated annually since 1952 (back when it was owned by Union Oil), the jack-o&#x27;-lantern draws 30,000 visitors annually.
* The Banning Museum - Phineas Banning—entrepreneur, the founder of the city of Wilmington, and “the Father of the Port of Los Angeles”—built the 23-room residence in 1864.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services operates the Torrance Health Center in Harbor Gateway, Los Angeles, near Torrance and serving Wilmington.

The United States Postal Service Wilmington Post Office is located at 1008 North Avalon Boulevard.

The community of Wilmington is located in the Council District 15 within the City of Los Angeles.

The community of Wilmington is represented by one Neighborhood Council, Wilmington Neighborhood Council.

==Education==

Only 5.1% of Wilmington residents aged 25 or older had completed a four-year degree by 2000, a low figure when compared with the city and the county at large, and the percentage of those residents with less than a high school diploma was high for the county. Wilmington is home to Harbor Teacher Preparation Academy, ranked the top high school in the city of Los Angeles and the fourth-best school in California.

<doc id="342036" wikidata="Q12899682" url="?curid=342036" title="Dog Latin">
<text>Dog Latin, or cod Latin, is a phrase or jargon that imitates Latin, often by what is referred to as &quot;translating&quot; English words (or those of other languages) into Latin by conjugating or declining them, as if they were Latin words. Dog Latin usually is a humorous device mocking scholarly seriousness. The term can also refer to a poor-quality attempt at writing genuine Latin.

==History==
Examples of this predate even Shakespeare, whose 1590s play, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, includes a reference to dog Latin:

Thomas Jefferson mentioned dog Latin by name in 1815:

* &quot;Illegitimi non carborundum&quot;, interpreted as &quot;Don&#x27;t let the bastards grind you down.&quot; Offred, the protagonist of the novel &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, finds a similar phrase scratched into the wall of her wardrobe: &quot;Nolite te bastardes carborundorum&quot;. 
* &quot;Semper ubi sub ubi&quot; is unintelligible as Latin, but translates word for word as &#x27;always where under where&#x27;, interpreted as &#x27;always wear underwear&#x27;.
* A once-common schoolboy doggerel which, though very poor Latin, would have done a tolerable job of reinforcing the rhythms of Latin hexameters:
:Insofar as this specimen can be translated, it is as follows:

:The meter uses Latin vowel quantities for the Latin parts, and to some extent follows English stress in the English parts.

:Another variant has similar lines in a different order:

:The meaning here is &quot;The storm rose up and overturned the boat&quot; and &quot;Except for John Periwig&quot;, etc.

* Another verse in similar vein, from Geoffrey Willans&#x27; &quot;Down with Skool&quot;, is:

:which, when read aloud using traditional English pronunciation of Latin, sounds like the following:

:but which means in Latin

* The following spoof of legal Latin, in the fictional case of &quot;Daniel v Dishclout&quot; (from George Alexander Stevens&#x27; &quot;Lecture on Heads&quot;, 1765), describes a kitchen:

:In English, this is:
* In a similar vein, a humorous love song of 1782, the text of which is attributed to John O&#x27;Keefe, states:
* Starting with its second season, &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; closes each episode with the recitation of the Possum Lodge motto, &quot;Quando omni flunkus moritati&quot; – which can be translated as &quot;When all else fails, play dead&quot;. In one episode, some of the members break away to form the rival Salamander Lodge, whose motto is &quot;Quando omni flunkus terra retreatum&quot; (&quot;When all else fails, climb under a rock&quot;).
* Finnish death metal band Omnium Gatherum gets its name from 1500s era butchered Latin meaning &quot;a hodgepodge of various things&quot;.
* The title of death/folk metal Verbal Deception&#x27;s debut album &quot;Aurum Aetus Piraticus&quot; is Dog Latin for &quot;Golden Age of Piracy&quot;.
* The songs of Era, a musical project by Eric Lévi, usually have nonsensical lyrics written in Dog Latin.
* The magazine name &quot;Atlas Obscura&quot;, while not wrong in and of itself, is improper Latin. In Latin, Atlas is the name of either the Greek giant, or the mountain range named after him, and does not refer to a collection of maps.
* A running gag in the series of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons starring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner assigns different fake Dog Latin species names in each episode to Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, i.e. &quot;Eatibus Anythingus&quot; and &quot;Acceleratti Incredibilus&quot;. The actual Latin species names for the coyote and road runner were used in a 2003 episode of the series, &quot;The Whizzard of Ow&quot;.
* The Warhammer 40,000 wargame universe makes frequent use of pseudo-Latin (which is referred to in-universe as &#x27;High Gothic&#x27;) in its product names and background material.

<text>Los Diaz de Doris is a Puerto Rican film made in 2002.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Los Diaz de Doris&quot; (&quot;Doris&#x27; Days&quot;) is the fictional story of &quot;Doris Diaz&quot;, a divorced mother of two who is an executive in a San Juan building.

&quot;Doris&quot; is a middle aged woman whose kids lead a secret life away from her: Her son dangles into the world of drugs, while her daughter lies to her about going to school, when in reality, she cuts class to meet with her boyfriend.

On a night out with her best friend, Doris meets a young company executive with whom she had had minimal contact before. They decide to see each other again, and then, they begin dating.

Soon, Doris begins to be harassed by a young woman, and she discovers that her boyfriend is actually a married man. The young wife turns out to be a psychotic person who is bilingual, an arts saleswoman, and only interested in keeping her marriage so that it would appear to high society that she has everything she wants.

During one of her getaways with her boyfriend, Doris&#x27; daughter stops at a supermarket to buy some snacks and gets involved in the middle of a robbery. She is taken hostage at gunpoint by the robbers, and held for ransom. During this situation, the new man in Doris&#x27; life helps gather the help of Doris&#x27; ex-husband and to keep the family united during the difficult moment. Doris&#x27; son is ordered by his underworld friends to conduct a murder, but the proposed victims turn out to be his sister&#x27;s kidnappers, so, instead of carrying out the murder order, he rescues his sister. She informs him she had been harmed, when he tried to find out if she had been raped.

Meanwhile, Doris&#x27; boyfriend&#x27;s wife had lied to him, telling him that he was sterile, and he could not have any children, this after discovering that Doris had become impregnated by her husband. It was actually she and not her husband who had been diagnosed as sterile, but she lied to keep Doris and her husband apart. As a consequence of the lies, Doris tells her boyfriend that she is pregnant, he thinks she was seeing another man because he was told he was sterile, and he does not accept responsibility for the baby.

But, on one night out, he runs into his family doctor, who told him that he was not the one with the problem. With his wife&#x27;s lies uncovered, he realizes that the baby Doris is carrying is his.

The movie ends with a scene where he runs down an avenue to follow a public bus where Doris is riding. He finally reaches the bus, and he explains everything, and asks Doris to forgive him, which she does, and the passengers in the bus applaud them as they kiss.

<doc id="342042" wikidata="Q706358" url="?curid=342042" title="James Hahn">
<text>James Kenneth Hahn (born July 3, 1950) is an American lawyer and politician. A Democrat, Hahn was elected the 40th mayor of Los Angeles in 2001. He served until 2005, at which time he was defeated in his bid for re-election. Prior to his term as Mayor, Hahn served in several other capacities for the city of Los Angeles, including deputy city attorney (1975–1979), city controller (1981–1985) and city attorney (1985–2001). Hahn is the only individual in the city&#x27;s history to have been elected to all three citywide offices. He is currently a sitting judge on the Los Angeles County Superior Court.

As Mayor, Hahn appointed Bill Bratton, the former NYPD Commissioner, as Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, opting not to renew Bernard Parks&#x27; second term as chief. Bratton&#x27;s appointment is widely seen as leading to the sharp declines in Los Angeles&#x27; crime rate and improved morale in the department. Hahn also led the successful campaign to defeat secession in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood, and San Pedro, thereby keeping Los Angeles intact. While he is noted primarily for these two accomplishments, they also helped lead to his unsuccessful re-election bid; African Americans upset at Parks&#x27; ousting and San Fernando Valley residents disappointed with the secession verdict had been the two constituencies that had propelled him to victory four years earlier in 2001.

A member of the Hahn family of California, he is the brother of Los Angeles County Supervisor and former Congresswoman Janice Hahn, the nephew of former California State Assemblyman and Los Angeles City Councilman Gordon Hahn and the son of former Los Angeles City Councilman and long-time Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn.

== Early life ==
Hahn was born on July 3, 1950, in Los Angeles, the son of Ramona (Fox) and Kenneth Hahn, and was raised in the Morningside Park district of Inglewood near South Los Angeles. Hahn attended Manchester Avenue Elementary School, Daniel Freeman Elementary School, Horace Mann Junior High School, and Los Angeles Lutheran High School.

He graduated from the Los Angeles campus of Pepperdine University in California magna cum laude with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and a minor in journalism in 1972. He received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the Pepperdine University School of Law in 1975. In 1994, he was selected as the School of Law&#x27;s distinguished alumnus. While in college, he assisted in the development of a paralegal program for the Family Law Center of the Legal Aid Society and during law school, he clerked for the Los Angeles district attorney&#x27;s office.

Upon graduation in 1975 until 1979, Hahn worked as a prosecutor and deputy city attorney in the Office of the City Attorney. From 1979 to 1981, he was in private practice with Robert Horner.

== City controller ==
In 1981, Hahn was elected the fifth City Controller of Los Angeles and served until 1985. Elected at the age of 30 and sworn in two days before his 31st birthday, Hahn is the youngest person ever elected to that position.

== City attorney ==
Hahn served from 1985 to 2001 as Los Angeles City Attorney, overseeing one of the largest public law offices in the nation with approximately 450 attorneys. As City Attorney, he worked to rid LA&#x27;s neighborhoods of gang activity through the use of gang injunctions. He was involved in crafting state legislation regarding gang enforcement known as the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act. During Hahn&#x27;s tenure, he led the litigation to stop the Joe Camel ad campaign and reached a settlement of 312 million dollars for the city. He used those funds to create the Tobacco Enforcement Project to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors. Hahn re-established the domestic violence unit and sponsored over 30 pieces of relevant state legislation, helping to shape California&#x27;s domestic violence laws.

== Mayor ==

Hahn was elected in 2001, defeating Antonio Villaraigosa to serve as the 40th mayor of Los Angeles.

=== Homeland security and public safety ===
In 2002, Mayor Hahn rejected Bernard Parks for a second term as Los Angeles police chief and appointed former NYPD Commissioner William Bratton to the position. Together with Bratton, he reinstated the community policing program, introduced the COMPSTAT system to better track crime, implemented a flexible work week schedule for officers, and streamlined LAPD&#x27;s hiring process, all part of a broader effort to increase the recruitment and retention of officers. As a result, the LAPD experienced an increase in its ranks, morale significantly rose throughout the department and all areas of crime dropped steadily.

Mayor Hahn provided funding to ensure the presence of at least one ambulance in every fire station throughout the city. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States Conference of Mayors appointed Hahn to serve as chair of its aviation security task force, in which he assisted in the passage of a federal aviation security bill. To better prepare the city for future emergencies, Hahn convened a Homeland Security cabinet in his office, coordinated Los Angeles&#x27; &quot;Operation Archangel&quot; to protect its infrastructure and lobbied for state and federal public safety grants.

=== Secession, city services and community engagement ===
Mayor Hahn led the successful efforts to defeat secession in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood, and San Pedro, effectively keeping the city together. He followed up with a program called &quot;Teamwork LA&quot; to bring government closer to the people, which among other initiatives, created seven neighborhood City Halls throughout the city and launched the city&#x27;s 24/7 non-emergency phone line 311.

He also championed the city&#x27;s neighborhood councils system which was approved by the City Council just before he became Mayor in May 2001; over eighty councils were certified during his time in office. Hahn implemented priority based budgeting to include neighborhood councils in the budget process, providing each council with $50,000 for any purpose and an additional $100,000 for street and sidewalk improvements.

With Councilman Eric Garcetti, Hahn created the Mayor&#x27;s Office of Immigrant Affairs to engage immigrants in civic life. The office was disbanded during the tenure of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa but revived when Garcetti became Mayor.

=== Economic development, housing and homelessness ===

Mayor Hahn created a $100 million affordable housing trust fund, which was at the time the nation&#x27;s largest, and expanded the adaptive reuse ordinance to convert dilapidated buildings into mixed-use residential properties. He identified the funding to keep the city&#x27;s homeless shelters open year-round and met with civic leaders across the county to establish a blue ribbon commission called &quot;Bring LA Home&quot; to end homelessness in Los Angeles County within a decade. He also worked with City Councilmembers Wendy Greuel and Eric Garcetti to initiate and sign into law seven business tax reforms, eliminating the business tax for businesses with gross receipts of $100,000 or less, and gradually reducing the tax by 15% for all other businesses.

Hahn led two trade missions as Mayor, the first to Mexico in 2001, and the second to Asia in 2002, where he visited Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan. In Mexico, Hahn met with Mexican President Vicente Fox, Mexican business and airline executives, and received an airport security briefing at Mexico City&#x27;s Mexico City International Airport. He announced agreements with AeroMexico Airlines to expand service out of Ontario International Airport, providing a more regional approach to air service in the Los Angeles area, and with supermarket chain Grupo Gigante to open five new stores in Los Angeles creating 1,000 new jobs.

In Beijing, Hahn reached an agreement concerning the upcoming 2008 Olympics, designating Los Angeles as gateway to Beijing and enabling Los Angeles firms to be hired to oversee the renovation and construction of the Beijing airport and other infrastructure projects. In an effort to regain tourism lost after September 11, Hahn launched the &quot;See My LA&quot; program in Tokyo with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; Kazuhisa Ishii and partnered with Korean soccer star Hong Myung-bo to boost Korean tourism to Los Angeles. Other agreements made the Los Angeles Zoo the first in the United States to exhibit a pair of Chinese golden monkeys, regionalized air service by shifting Taiwan-based EVA Airlines&#x27; operations to Ontario International Airport, and improved air quality by plugging more Asian cargo ships into natural power while docked at the Port of Los Angeles.

=== Education, workforce development, youth and families ===
Mayor Hahn partnered with the Los Angeles Unified School District to expedite the construction of new campuses to relieve overcrowding and worked to create joint-use partnerships with the district so that schools become the central focus of their respective neighborhoods.

The Mayor led a major expansion of the after school program for elementary school students, &quot;LA&#x27;s Best,&quot; to 52 more elementary schools, serving an additional 5,500 students, bringing the total to more than 20,000.

Hahn launched the Literacy@Work program to train LA&#x27;s workforce after a study he commissioned identified fifty-three percent of working-age Los Angeles County residents had trouble reading street signs or bus schedules, filling out job applications in English or understanding a utility bill and the One City One Book program &quot;One Book, One City LA,&quot; a citywide reading initiative anchored by a book selected by the Mayor. Choices included Ray Bradbury&#x27;s Fahrenheit 451 in 2002, Sandra Cisneros&#x27; House on Mango Street in 2003, and Laura Hillenbrand&#x27;s Seabiscuit in 2004.

Hahn also created the Free Cash for College program, to assist more low income high school seniors secure financial aid for college.

=== Energy and the environment ===
As Mayor, Hahn canceled the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power&#x27;s proposed investment of up to $400 million in a coal-fired electricity plant in Utah, instead saying those resources should meet his goal of increasing&#x27;s the city&#x27;s use of renewable energy from three percent to twenty percent by 2017. He later endorsed a goal of specifically generating one percent of the city&#x27;s electricity from solar power by 2017.

Hahn began the transition of the city&#x27;s fleet of vehicles to hybrid vehicles and created the Alternative Maritime Power program at the Port of Los Angeles to enable large cruise and cargo ships to plug into clean power while docked at the port. The Mayor also pledged to make Los Angeles a landfill free city by 2006.

=== Transportation ===
The Mayor&#x27;s Traffic Safety and Congestion Relief plan targeted improvements to the city&#x27;s worst twenty-five intersections each year and his Street Smart program made improvements to 35 of the city&#x27;s busiest thoroughfares.

After negotiating an agreement with City Councilmember Cindy Miscikowski, Hahn passed a $9 billion modernization plan for Los Angeles International Airport to both increase the number of annual passengers and make the airport more secure post-September 11.

== Family ==

Hahn is from a family of politicians. His father, Kenneth Hahn served as an LA City Councilman and as an LA County Supervisor for 40 years. Hahn&#x27;s uncle, Gordon Hahn was a state assemblyman and an LA City Councilman and another uncle, John Hahn, was assistant county clerk. His cousin, Dale Hahn, is a Superior Court judge in San Mateo County. His sister, Janice Hahn, represented the 15th District of the Los Angeles City Council, served in Congress, and now sits on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.

== Post-mayoral career ==

After leaving office, Hahn accepted the position of a managing director and partner at the firm Chadwick Saylor &amp; Company, a Los Angeles-based investment banking firm. On March 1, 2006, Hahn was announced as CEO of Los Angeles Development Partners, L.P., an $800 million fund launched by Chadwick Saylor &amp; Company intended to help create affordable housing and other developments around transportation hubs such as rail stations. Hahn left the company at the beginning of 2008, according to trade publication Real Estate Alert and joined private conflict resolution provider Alternative Resolution Centers, LLC&#x27;s panel of neutrals.

On October 19, 2005, Hahn took part in a discussion entitled &quot;The State of Los Angeles&quot;, sponsored by a non-profit organization called &quot;Days of Dialogue&quot;. The other panelists were former Mayor Richard Riordan and current Mayor, at that time, Antonio Villaraigosa, the only other living mayors. &quot;Days of Dialogue&quot; was founded after the notorious O. J. Simpson trial in order to encourage discussions on key issues in the Los Angeles region.

On December 12, 2005, Hahn delivered a eulogy at the funeral of longtime city councilman Marvin Braude.

On September 20, 2006, more than a year after leaving office, a Steve Lopez column ran in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; explaining Hahn&#x27;s new life in the private sector. Hahn said that he is now as happy as ever and for the first time in decades, can truly enjoy his city. He gets to spend more time with his son and daughter and has been in a steady relationship with a woman for over a year. He also enjoys his new work getting unions to invest money in local projects around transit lines to relieve traffic and smog.

On November 8, 2007, Hahn&#x27;s official portrait was displayed in the Hall of Mayors Portrait Gallery on the 26th floor of City Hall. The event was accompanied by ceremonies on the 26th floor as well as before the City Council.

In May 2008, Hahn said that he had submitted paperwork requisite for the pursuit of a judicial appointment by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Noting that he found himself missing public service, Hahn said he&#x27;d also spoken personally to the governor about his interest in becoming a judge. On November 5, 2008, Schwarzenegger appointed Hahn to fill a vacant judgeship in the Los Angeles County Superior Court.
Hahn presently presides over Traffic Court cases in Santa Monica.

In 2013, Hahn joined Mayor Eric Garcetti and former Mayors Richard Riordan and Antonio Villaraigosa at the opening of the renovated Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport, where Garcetti honored them for their efforts to revamp the airport.

In 2014, Los Angeles City Hall East, which houses the offices of the Los Angeles City Controller and Los Angeles City Attorney, two positions Hahn held, was renamed as the James K. Hahn City Hall East building.

In 2017, Hahn again joined former Mayors Richard Riordan and Antonio Villaraigosa for a moderated conversation as part of the University of California, Los Angeles&#x27;s &quot;Why History Matters&quot; series.

<doc id="342043" wikidata="Q17118915" url="?curid=342043" title="A Defence of Common Sense">
<text>&quot;A defence of common sense&quot; is a 1925 essay by philosopher G. E. Moore. In it, he attempts to refute absolute skepticism (or nihilism) by arguing that at least some of our established beliefs about the world are absolutely certain, so they can be legitimately called &quot;facts&quot;. Moore argues that these beliefs are common sense.

==Summary==
In section one, he argues that he has certain knowledge of a number of truisms, such as &quot;My body has existed continuously on or near the earth, at various distances from or in contact with other existing things, including other living human beings&quot;, &quot;I am a human being&quot;, and &quot;My body existed yesterday&quot;.

In section two, he argues that there is a distinction between mental facts and physical facts. He says there is no good reason to believe, as many philosophers of his time did, that every physical fact is logically dependent on mental facts, or that every physical fact is causally dependent on mental facts. An example of a physical fact is &quot;The mantelpiece is at present nearer to this body than that bookcase is&quot;. Mental facts include &quot;I am conscious now&quot; and &quot;I am seeing something now&quot;.

In section three, he affirms that not only does he not think there are good reasons for believing that all material objects were created by God, but neither does common sense give reasons to think that God exists at all or that there is an afterlife.

The fourth section considers how common sense propositions like &quot;Here is my hand&quot; are to be analysed. Moore considers three possibilities that occur to him for how what we know in these cases is related to what we know about our sense-data, i.e. what he sees when looking at his hand. Moore concludes that we are absolutely certain about the common sense belief, but that no analysis of the propositions has been offered that is even close to being certain.

The fifth section is an examination of the problem of other minds, the idea that one can not be certain that other minds exist. Moore argues that &quot;there are other &#x27;selves&#x27;&quot;, but explains why this question has baffled philosophers. In other words, the sense data that he perceives through his senses are facts about the interaction of the external world and himself, but he (and other philosophers) do not know how to analyze these interactions.

<text>Odia (; , ISO: , ; formerly rendered as Oriya) is a classical Indo-Aryan language spoken in the Indian state of Odisha. It is the official language in Odisha (formerly rendered as Orissa), where native speakers make up 82% of the population, and it is also spoken in parts of West Bengal, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Odia is one of the official languages of India; it is the official language of Odisha and the second official language of Jharkhand. The Odia language has various dialects varieties, including the Baleswari Odia (Northern dialect), Kataki (central dialect), Ganjami Odia (Southern dialect), Sundargadi Odia (Northwestern dialect), Sambalpuri (Western dialect), Desia (South-western dialect) and Tribal Community dialects who spoken by the tribals groups in Odisha who adopted the Odia language.

Odia is the sixth Indian language to be designated a classical language.

==History==
Odia is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-Aryan language family. It descends from Odra Prakrit which itself evolved from Magadhi Prakrit. The latter was spoken in east India over 1,500 years ago, and is the primary language used in early Jain and Buddhist texts. Odia appears to have had relatively little influence from Persian and Arabic, compared to other major Indo-Aryan languages.

The history of the Odia language is divided into eras:

* Proto-Odia (Odra Prakrit) (10th century and earlier): Inscriptions from 9th century shows the evolution of proto-Odia, i.e. Odra Prakrit or &quot;Oriya Prakrit&quot; words used along with Sanskrit. The inscriptions are dated to third quarter of 9th century during the reign of early Eastern Gangas.
* Old Odia (10th century till 13th century): Inscriptions from the 10th century onwards provide evidence for the existence of the Old Odia language, with the earliest inscription being the Urajam inscription of the Eastern Gangas written in Old Odia in 1051 CE. Old Odia written in the form of connected lines is found in inscription dated to 1249 CE.
* Early Middle Odia (13th century–15th century): The earliest use of prose can be found in the &quot;Madala Panji&quot; of the Jagannath Temple at Puri, which dates back to the 12th century. Such works as &quot;Sisu Beda&quot;, &quot;Amarakosa&quot;, &quot;Gorekha Samhita&quot;, &quot;Kalasa Chautisa&quot; and &quot;Saptanga&quot; are written in this form of Odia.
* Middle Odia (15th century–17th century): Sarala Das writes the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Bilanka Ramayana&quot;. Towards the 15th century, Panchasakha &#x27;five seer poets&#x27; namely Balarama Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Achyutananda Dasa, Sisu Ananta Dasa and Jasobanta Dasa wrote a number of popular works, including the &quot;Odia Bhagabata&quot;, &quot;Jagamohana Ramayana&quot;, &quot;Lakshmi Purana&quot;, &quot;Haribansa&quot;, &quot;Gobinda Chandra&quot; and more. Balarama Dasa, Ananta Dasa and Achyutananda Dasa of Pancha Sakha group hailed from Karana community.
* Late Middle Odia (17th century–Early 19th century): &quot;Usabhilasa&quot; of Sisu Sankara Dasa, the &quot;Rahasya Manjari&quot; of Deba Durlabha Dasa and the &quot;Rukmini Bibaha&quot; of Kartika Dasa were written. Upendra Bhanja took a leading role in this period with his creations &quot;Baidehisa Bilasa&quot;, &quot;Koti Brahmanda Sundari&quot;, &quot;Labanyabati&quot; which emerged as landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa&#x27;s &quot;Rasakallola&quot; and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara&#x27;s &quot;Bidagdha Chintamani&quot; were prominent latter kabyas. Of the song poets who spearheaded Odissi music, classical music of the state – Upendra Bhanja, Banamali, Kabisurjya Baladeba Ratha, Gopalakrusna were prominent. Bhima Bhoi emerged towards the end of the 19th century.
* Modern Odia (Late 19th century to present): The first Odia magazine, Bodha Dayini was published in Balasore in 1861. During this time many Bengali scholars claimed that Odia was just a dialect of Bengali to exercise of power by cornering government jobs. For instance Pandit Kanti Chandra Bhattacharya, a teacher of Balasore Zilla School, published a little pamphlet named &#x27;Odia Ekti Swatantray Bhasha Noi&#x27; (Odia not an independent language) where Bhattacharya claimed that Odia was not a separate and original form of language and was a mere corruption of Bengali. He suggested British Government to abolish all Odia Vernacular Schools from Odisha and to alter into Bengali Vernacular Schools. The first Odia newspaper &quot;Utkala Deepika&quot;, launched in 1866 under editors Gourishankar Ray and Bichitrananda. In 1869 Bhagavati Charan Das started another newspaper, Utkal Subhakari. More Odia newspapers soon followed like Utkal Patra, Utkal Hiteisini from Cuttack, Utkal Darpan and Sambada Vahika from Balasore and Sambalpur Hiteisini from Deogarh. Fakir Mohan Senapati emerged as a prominent Odia fiction writer of this time and Radhanath Ray as a prominent Odia poet. Other prominent Odia writers who helped promote Odia at this time were Madhusudan Das, Madhusudan Rao, Gangadhar Meher, Chintamani Mohanty, Nanda Kishore Bal, Reba Ray, Gopabandhu Das and Nilakantha Das.

==Geographical distribution==
===India===
According to the 2011 census, there are 37.52 million Odia speakers in India, making up 3.1% of the country&#x27;s population. Among these, 93% reside in Odisha. Odia is also spoken in neighbouring states such as Chhattisgarh (913,581), Jharkhand (531,077), Andhra Pradesh (361,471), and West Bengal (162,142), as of 2011 Census.

Due to worker migration as tea garden workers in colonial India, northeastern states Assam and Tripura have a sizeable Odia-speaking population, particularly in Sonitpur, Tinsukia, Udalguri, Sivasagar, Golaghat, Dibrugarh, Cachar, Nagaon, Karimganj, Karbi Anglong, Jorhat, Lakhimpur, Baksa, Kamrup Metropolitan, Hailakandi district of Assam and West Tripura, Dhalai, North Tripura district of Tripura. Similarly, due to increasing worker migration in modern India, the western states Gujarat and Maharashtra also have a significant Odia speaking population. Additionally, due to economic pursuits, significant numbers of Odia speakers can be found in Indian cities such as Vishakhapatnam, Hyderabad, Pondicherry, Kolkata, Bangalore, Chennai, Goa, Mumbai, Raipur, Jamshedpur, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Guwahati, Shillong, Pune, Gurgaon, Jammu and Silvassa.

===Foreign countries===
The Odia diaspora is sizeable in several countries around the world, bringing the number of Odia speakers worldwide to 50 million. It has a significant presence in eastern countries, such as Thailand and Indonesia, mainly brought by the sadhaba, ancient traders from Odisha who carried the language along with the culture during the old-day trading, and in western countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and England. The language has also spread to Burma, Malaysia, Fiji, Mauritius, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Middle East countries.

==Standardisation and dialects==
===Major varieties or dialects===

Also spoken in parts of Raigarh, Mahasamund and Raipur districts of Chhattisgarh. A 2006 survey of the varieties spoken in four villages in Western Odisha found out that Sambalpuri share three-quarters of their basic vocabulary with Standard Odia and has 75%–76% lexical similarity with Standard Odia.
* Desia (Southwestern Odia/Koraputi): Spoken in southwestern districts of Nabarangpur, Rayagada, Koraput, Malkangiri and southern parts of Kalahandi districts of Odisha and in the hilly regions of Vishakhapatnam and, Vizianagaram districts of Andhra Pradesh.

==Phonology==

Odia has 30 consonant phonemes, 2 semivowel phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes.

Length is not contrastive. The vowel can also be heard as an allophone of , or as an allophone of the coalescence of the sequences or . Final vowels are pronounced in the standard language, e.g. Odia contrasts Bengali &quot;flower&quot;.

Odia retains the voiced retroflex lateral approximant , among the Eastern Indo-Aryan languages. The velar nasal is given phonemic status in some analyses, as it also occurs as a terminal sound, e.g. ଏବଂ- ebaṅ /ebɔŋ/ Nasals assimilate for place in nasal–stop clusters. have the near-allophonic intervocalic flaps in intervocalic position and in final position (but not at morpheme boundaries). Stops are sometimes deaspirated between and a vowel or an open syllable +vowel and a vowel. Some speakers distinguish between single and geminate consonants.

==Grammar==

Odia retains most of the cases of Sanskrit, though the nominative and vocative have merged (both without a separate marker), as have the accusative and dative. There are three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and two grammatical numbers(singular and plural). However, there are no grammatical genders. The usage of gender is semantic, i.e. to differentiate male members of a class from female members. There are three tenses coded via affixes (i.e., present, past and future), others being expressed via auxiliaries.

==Writing system==
The Odia language uses the Odia script (also known as the Kalinga script). It is a Brahmic script used to write primarily the Odia language and others like Sanskrit and several minor regional languages. The script has developed over nearly 1000 years, with the earliest trace of the script being dated to 1051 AD.

Odia is a syllabic alphabet, or an abugida, wherein all consonants have an inherent vowel. Diacritics (which can appear above, below, before, or after the consonant they belong to) are used to change the form of the inherent vowel. When vowels appear at the beginning of a syllable, they are written as independent letters. Also, when certain consonants occur together, special conjunct symbols are used to combine the essential parts of each consonant symbol.

The curved appearance of the Odia script is a result of the practice of writing on palm leaves, which have a tendency to tear if too many straight lines are used.

==Literature==

The earliest literature in Odia can be traced to the Charyapadas, composed in the 7th to 9th centuries. Before Sarala Das, the most important works in Odia literature are the Shishu Veda, Saptanga, Amara Kosha, &quot;Rudrasudhanidhi&quot;, &quot;Kesaba Koili&quot;, &quot;Kalasa Chautisa,&quot; etc. In the 14th century, the poet Sarala Das wrote the Sarala Mahabharata, Chandi Purana, and Vilanka Ramayana, in praise of the goddess Durga. Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.

The following era is termed the Panchasakha Age and stretches until the year 1700. Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of Balarama Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Yasovanta, Ananta and Acyutananda. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the &quot;Usabhilasa&quot; of Sisu Sankara Dasa, the &quot;Rahasya Manjari&quot; of Debadurlabha Dasa and the &quot;Rukmini Bibha&quot; of Kartika Dasa. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote &quot;Harabali&quot;. Other poets, like Madhusudana, Bhima Dhibara, Sadasiba and Sisu Iswara Dasa composed another form called kavyas (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.

However, during the Bhanja Age (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era&#x27;s eponymous poet Upendra Bhanja (1670–1720). Bhanja&#x27;s work inspired many imitators, of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.

The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the Bengali and Assamese scripts, the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different. Amos Sutton produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841–43) and &quot;An Introductory Grammar of Oriya&quot; (1844).

Odia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. Sarala Dasa who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the Vyasa of Odisha. He wrote the Mahabharata into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating or transcreating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, Ramayana and the Bhagavad Gita. The translation of the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; by &quot;Atibadi&quot; Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Another of the Panchasakha, &quot;Matta&quot; Balarama Dasa transcreated the Ramayana in Odia, titled &quot;Jagamohana Ramayana&quot;. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially devotional poetry.

Other eminent Odia poets include &quot;Kabi Samrat&quot; Upendra Bhanja, &quot;Kabisurjya&quot; Baladeba Ratha, Banamali Dasa, Dinakrusna Dasa and Gopalakrusna Pattanayaka. Classical Odia literature is inextricably tied to music, and most of it was written for singing, set to traditional Odissi ragas and talas. These compositions form the core of the system of Odissi music, the classical music of the state.

Three great poets and prose writers, Kabibar Radhanath Ray (1849–1908), Fakir Mohan Senapati (1843–1918) and Madhusudan Rao (1853–1912) made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).

Among the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda&#x27;s Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra&#x27;s Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form.

One of the great writers in the 20th century was Pandit Krushna Chandra Kar (1907–1995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like &quot;Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala&quot;, etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in 1971–72 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children&#x27;s fiction, and biographies.

One of the prominent writers of the 20th and 21st centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927–2002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five &#x27;Pancha Sakhas&#x27; of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are &#x27;Bhala Manisha Hua&#x27;, &#x27;Manishi Nilakantha&#x27;, &#x27;Kabi Godabarisha&#x27;, &#x27;Byasakabi Fakiramohan&#x27;, &#x27;Usha&#x27;, &#x27;Barabati&#x27;.

20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi Nanda Kishore Bal, Gangadhar Meher, Chintamani Mahanti and Kuntala Kumari Sabat, besides Niladri Dasa and Gopabandhu Das. The most notable novelists were Umesa Sarakara, Divyasimha Panigrahi, Gopala Chandra Praharaj and Kalindi Charan Panigrahi. Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were Godabarisha Mohapatra, Mayadhar Mansingh, Nityananda Mahapatra and Kunjabihari Dasa. Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi is known for his translations of some western classics apart from Udayanatha Shadangi, Sunanda Kara and Surendranatha Dwivedi. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor Girija Shankar Ray, Pandit Vinayaka Misra, Professor Gauri Kumara Brahma, Jagabandhu Simha and Harekrushna Mahatab. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the Odia people who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilisation in the field of art and literature. Now Writers Manoj Das&#x27;s creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle. Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include Baidyanath Misra, Fakir Mohan Senapati, Madhusudan Das, Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, Surendra Mohanty, Manoj Das, Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, Jagadish Mohanty, Sarojini Sahoo, Yashodhara Mishra, Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal. But it is poetry that makes modern Odia literature a force to reckon with. Poets like Kabibar Radhanath Ray, Sachidananda Routray, Guruprasad Mohanty, Soubhagya Misra, Ramakanta Rath, Sitakanta Mohapatra, Rajendra Kishore Panda, Pratibha Satpathy have made significant contributions towards Indian poetry.

Anita Desai&#x27;s novella, &quot;Translator Translated&quot;, from her collection &quot;The Art of Disappearance&quot;, features a translator of a fictive Odia short story writer. The novella contains a discussion of the perils of translating works composed in regional Indian languages into English.

Four writers in Odia – Gopinath Mohanty, Sachidananda Routray, Sitakant Mahapatra and Pratibha Ray – have been awarded the Jnanpith, an Indian literary award.

<text>Ellen Fullman (born 1957) is an American composer, instrument builder, and performer. She was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and is currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. She is known for her 70-foot (21-meter) Long String instrument, tuned in just intonation and played with rosin-coated fingers.

==Biography and work==
Fullman studied sculpture at the Kansas City Art Institute before moving to New York in the early 1980s. In Kansas City she created and performed in an amplified metal sound-producing skirt and wrote art songs which she recorded in New York for a small cassette label. In 1981, she began developing the Long String Instrument at her studio in Brooklyn, consisting of dozens of metallic strings played with rosin-coated fingers and producing a chorus of organ-like partials. This instrument has been compared to the experience of standing inside an enormous grand piano. She has recorded extensively with this unusual instrument and has collaborated with such luminary figures as composer Pauline Oliveros, choreographer Deborah Hay, the Kronos Quartet, and Frances-Marie Uitti. In 1985, she was in residence at the Apollohuis in the Netherlands, where she recorded The Long String Instrument (LP) for Apollo Records.

==Recognition==

Fullman has been the recipient of numerous awards, commissions and residencies, including:
*a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award (2015)

Using archival footage, Fullman edited &quot;Suspended Music&quot;, a documentary film on her collaboration with Pauline Oliveros&#x27;s Deep Listening Band, which premiered at the Pacific Film Archive, UC Berkeley (2004).

<text>An armoire desk is a writing-table built within a large cabinet, usually high. The cabinet is closed by two to four full-height doors, to keep out dust or to give a tidy appearance to a room by hiding the cluttered working surface of the desk. This form of desk is usually placed against a wall, like its antique uncle, the secretary desk.


Small or home offices are the usual habitat of the modern armoire desk. Corporations and government bureaucracies typically shun the armoire desk, preferring pedestal desks and cubicles in most instances. The closest ancestor, in form, of the armoire desk, is the Moore desk.

The armoire desk is often called a &quot;computer armoire desk&quot;, or a computer desk, since it is used in present times to house a computer and its peripherals. Holes are provided to connect the peripherals located in several nooks above or below the main work surface. Often, the work surface or surfaces, such as a writing area or a computer keyboard tray are adjustable to provide an ergonomically sound working environment.

Some armoire desks have a fixed work surface, which stays in place when the doors are closed, and moves only for ergonomic adjustments. This kind of armoire desk is a direct descendant of the antique rolltop desk which was common in corporate or government offices three or four generations ago, since it provides a fast and efficient way to store or hide current work.

Other armoire desks have an easily movable, often hinged, work surface which must be cleared of documents and other items in order to close the doors. This kind of armoire desk is a morphological descendant of the famous Wooton desk by its size and by the necessity to constantly store papers to shut it. There is also the alternative of always leaving it open, given the trouble involved. The fall front desk or &quot;secrétaire à abattant&quot;, and the slant top desk are also related.

Unlike all of these earlier relations, however, the modern armoire desk usually does not have a lock. Armoire desks are normally very practical pieces of furniture, despite the use of rich veneers and very complex exterior styling in some of the costlier models.

Modern variations of the armoire desk include slide-out surface(s) for a computer keyboard keyboard and mouse pad. Working height is also increased an inch, from 29 inches (73.5 cm) off the floor to 30 inches (76 cm).

<text>The Iranian plateau or Persian plateau is a geological feature spanning parts of the Caucasus, Central Asia, South Asia, and West Asia. It makes up part of the Eurasian plate, and is wedged between the Arabian plate and the Indian plate. The plateau is situated between the Zagros Mountains to the west, the Caspian Sea and the Köpet Dag to the north, the Armenian Highlands and the Caucasus Mountains to the northwest, the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf to the south, and the Indian subcontinent to the southeast.

As a historical region, it includes Parthia, Media, Persis, and some of the previous territories of Greater Iran. The Zagros form the plateau&#x27;s western boundary, and its eastern slopes may also be included in the term. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; excludes &quot;lowland Khuzestan&quot; explicitly and characterizes Elam as spanning &quot;the region from the Mesopotamian plain to the Iranian Plateau&quot;.

From the Caspian Sea in the northwest to the Sulaiman Mountains in the southeast, the Iranian Plateau extends for close to . It encompasses a large part of Iran, all of Afghanistan, and the parts of Pakistan that are situated to the west of the Indus River, covering an area of some In spite of being called a plateau, it is far from flat, and contains several mountain ranges; its highest point is Noshaq in the Hindu Kush at , and its lowest point is the Lut Desert to the east of Kerman, Iran, at below .

== Geology ==
In geology, the plateau region of Iran primarily formed from the accretionary Gondwanan terranes between the Turan platform to the north and the Zagros fold and thrust belt; the suture zone between the northward moving Arabian plate and the Eurasian continent is the Iranian plateau. It is a geologically well-studied area because of general interest in continental collision zones, and because of Iran&#x27;s long history of research in geology, particularly in economic geology.

==Geography==
The Iranian plateau in geology refers to a geographical area north of the great folded mountain belts resulting from the collision of the Arabian plate with the Eurasian plate. In this definition, the Iranian plateau does not cover southwestern Iran.

The plateau extends from East Azerbaijan province in northwest of Iran (Persia) all the way to Afghanistan and Pakistan west of the Indus River. It also includes smaller parts of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Iraqi Kurdistan, and Turkmenistan.
The northwestern Iranian plateau, where the Pontic and Taurus Mountains converge, is rugged country with higher elevations, a more severe climate, and greater precipitation than are found on the Anatolian plateau. The region is known as the Anti-Taurus, and the average elevation of its peaks exceeds . Mount Ararat, at 5,137 meters (16,854 ft) the highest point in Turkey, is located in the Anti-Taurus. Lake Van is situated in the mountains at an elevation of 1,546 meters (5,072 ft).

The headwaters of major rivers arise in the Anti-Taurus: the east-flowing Aras River flows into the Caspian Sea, and the south-flowing Euphrates and Tigris join in Iraq before flowing into the Persian Gulf. Several small streams that flow into the Black Sea or landlocked Lake Van also originate in these mountains. The Indus River begins in the highlands of Tibet and flows the length of Pakistan almost tracing the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau.

Southeast Anatolia lies south of the Anti-Taurus Mountains. It is a region of rolling hills and a broad plateau surface that extends into Syria. Elevations decrease gradually, from about 800 meters (2,600 ft) in the north to about 500 meters (1,600 ft) in the south. Traditionally, wheat and barley are the main crops of the region.

=== Mountain ranges ===
The plateau&#x27;s mountain ranges can be divided into five major subregions:

====Northwest Iranian Ranges====
* Alborz
** Damavand 

====Southwest Iranian Ranges====
* Zagros
** Dena 

====Central Iranian plateau====
** Kūh-e Hazār 
** Kuh-e Jebal Barez

====Eastern Iranian Ranges====
** Kopet Dag
*** Kuh-e Siah Khvani 
** Eshdeger Range
* Balochistan
** Sikaram 
** Kuh-e Taftan 
** Zargun 

=== Rivers and plains ===
* Kavir Desert
* Lut Desert
* Hamun-e Jaz Murian
** Halil River
* Gavkhouni
** Zayandeh River
* Sistan Basin
** Helmand River
** Farah River

==History==

The Iranian plateau may have played a major role in the expansion of modern humans after the Out of Africa migration, serving as &#x27;population hub&#x27; for &#x27;Common Eurasians&#x27;, where they subsequently diverged into &#x27;Ancient East Eurasians&#x27; and &#x27;Ancient West Eurasians&#x27; at c. 50,000 years ago, and from where they expanded in two waves during the Initial Upper Paleolithic (c. 45kya) and Upper Paleolithic (c. 38kya) periods respectively. Ancient and modern populations in the Iranian plateau have a similar genetic component to the Ancient West Eurasian lineage which stayed in the &#x27;population hub&#x27; (WEC2), but also display some ancestry from Basal Eurasians and Ancient East Eurasians via contact events starting in the Paleolithic.

In the Bronze Age, Elam stretched across the Zagros mountains, connecting Mesopotamia and the Iranian plateau. The kingdoms of Aratta, known from cuneiform sources, may have been located in the central Iranian plateau. In classical antiquity the region was known as Persia, due to the Persian Achaemenid dynasty originating in Fars. The Middle Persian &quot;Erān&quot; (whence Modern Persian &quot;Irān&quot;) began to be used in reference to the state (rather than as an ethnic designator) from the Sassanid period (see Etymology of Iran).

==Archaeology==

Archaeological sites and cultures of the Iranian plateau include:
* Central Iranian plateau (&quot;Jiroft culture&quot;)
** Shahr-i Sokhta
** Konar Sandal
** Tepe Yahya
* Zayandeh River Civilization
* Tappeh Sialk
* Paleolithic sites
** Niasar
** Sefid-Ab
** Kaftar Khoun
** Qal&#x27;eh Bozi
** Mirak
** Delazian
** Tabas
** Masileh

==Flora==
The plateau has historical oak and poplar forests. Oak forests are found around Shiraz. Aspen, elm, ash, willow, walnut, pine, and cypress are also found, though the latter two are rare. As of 1920, poplar was harvested for making doors. Elm was used for ploughs. Other trees like acacia, cypress, and Turkestan elm were used for decorative purposes. Flower wise, the plateau can grow lilac, jasmine, and roses. Hawthorn and &quot;Cercis siliquastrum&quot; are common, which are both used for basket weaving.

== Fauna ==
The plateau is abundant with wildlife including leopards, bears, hyenas, wild boars, ibex, gazelles, and mouflons. These animals are mostly found in the wooded mountains of the plateau. The shores of the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf house aquatic birds such as seagulls, ducks, and geese. 
Deer, hedgehogs, foxes, and 22 species of rodents are found in semidesert, and palm squirrels and Asiatic black bears live in Baluchistan.

Wide variety of amphibians and reptiles such as toads, frogs, tortoises, lizards, salamanders, racers, rat snakes (&quot;Ptyas&quot;), cat snakes (&quot;Tarbophis fallax&quot;), and vipers live the Baluchistan region and along the slopes of the Elburz and Zagros mountains. 200 varieties of fish live in the Persian Gulf. Thirty species of the most important commercial fish Sturgeon is found in the Caspian Sea.

==Economy==
The Iranian plateau harvests trees for making doors, ploughs, and baskets. Fruit is grown also. Pears, apples, apricots, quince, plums, nectarines, cherries, mulberries, and peaches were commonly seen in the 20th century. Almonds and pistachios are common in warmer areas. Dates, oranges, grapes, melon, and limes are also grown. Other edibles include potatoes and cauliflower, which were hard to grow until European settlement brought irrigation improvements. Other vegetables include cabbage, tomatoes, artichokes, cucumbers, spinach, radishes, lettuce, and eggplants.

The plateau also produces wheat, barley, millet, beans, opium, cotton, lucerne, and tobacco. The barley is fed mainly to horses. Sesame is grown and made into sesame oil. Mushrooms and manna were also seen in the plateau area as of 1920. Caraway is grown in the Kerman province.

<doc id="342057" wikidata="Q294072" url="?curid=342057" title="Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej">
<text>Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (; 8 November 1901 – 19 March 1965) was a Romanian politician. He was the first Communist leader of Romania from 1947 to 1965, serving as first secretary of the Romanian Communist Party (ultimately &quot;Romanian Workers&#x27; Party&quot;, PMR) from 1944 to 1954 and from 1955 to 1965, and as the first Communist Prime Minister of Romania from 1952 to 1955.

Born in Bârlad (1901), Gheorghiu-Dej was involved in the communist movement&#x27;s activities from the early 1930s. Upon the outbreak of World War II in Europe, he was imprisoned by Ion Antonescu&#x27;s regime in the Târgu Jiu internment camp, and escaped only in August 1944. After the forces of King Michael ousted Antonescu and had him arrested for war crimes, Gheorghiu-Dej together with prime-minister Petru Groza pressured the King into abdicating in December 1947, marking the onset of out-and-out Communist rule in Romania.

Under his rule, Romania was considered one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most loyal satellite states, though Gheorghiu-Dej was partially unnerved by the rapid de-Stalinization policy initiated by Nikita Khrushchev at the end of the 1950s. Gheorghiu-Dej stepped up measures that greatly increased trade relations between Romania and the Western countries. At the same time his government committed human rights violations within the country.

He died of lung cancer in March 1965. His once protégé Nicolae Ceaușescu succeeded him as General Secretary.

== Early life ==
Gheorghiu-Dej was the son of a poor worker from Bârlad, his father was Tănase Gheorghiu and his mother, Ana. At the age of two he was adopted by his uncle Nicolae Gheorghe Ionescu from Moinești, Bacău County and attended secondary school in the current school no. 1 &quot;Ștefan Luchian&quot;.  After finishing school, he worked at a sawmill, at a weaving mill, and then worked for carpenters in Piatra Neamț and Moinești. He also had a younger sister named Tinca Gheorghiu.

== Career ==
Poverty made him leave school early on and start working at the age of 11. Due to his age and the lack of professional training, he often changed jobs, eventually settling to be an electrician. Working at a factory in Comănești, he joined the workers&#x27; union and participated in the 1920 Romanian general strike, during which all the participants were dismissed.

A year later, he was hired as an electrician at the Galați tramway company, where he was also fired after organizing protests against the 9-hour workday and for higher wages. He was later hired by the Romanian Railways (CFR) workshops in Galați.

As the workers&#x27; standard of living was already low, the Great Depression in Romania began eroding it much more so. In 1930, Gheorghiu became more politically active, joining the Communist Party of Romania. He was assigned to organize agitation in the Romanian Railways workshops in Moldavia.

On 15 August 1931 Gheorghiu was accused of &quot;communist agitation&quot; and punitively transferred to Dej, a town in Transylvania, where he continued the union activity. The union presented a petition in February 1932 to the CFR Railways, demanding better working conditions and higher wages. As a response, the CFR Railways closed down the Dej plant and fired all the workers, including Gheorghiu, who was deprived of the opportunity to be hired by any other CFR Railways workshop in the country.

===Activist===
During this time, Gheorghiu got the moniker Gheorghiu-Dej from the Siguranța (secret police), in order for his name to be differentiated from other union activists called Gheorghiu. After his dismissal from the CFR Railways workshop, Gheorghiu became even more active in organizing the unions and coordinating the workers of Iași, Pașcani, and Galați.

On the night of 14–15 July 1932 he was arrested for placing &quot;subversive posters on the walls and poles of Giulești Road&quot;, being held in the Văcărești Prison. Defended by lawyer Iosif Schraier, he was freed because the posters were meant to be related to the elections, during the electoral campaign for the 1932 Romanian general election.

Gheorghiu-Dej was briefly arrested again on 3 October 1932, at the end of a workers&#x27; meeting in Iași, after he urged the workers to &quot;unite for the fight against the capitalist class&quot;, on alleged charges of having hit a police commissioner. He was freed as the charges were found to be false.

In January 1933, the Romanian Government announced some even more stringent austerity measures that included new wages cuts, which led to the radicalization of the workers. Gheorghiu-Dej, together with union president Constantin Doncea, led the Bucharest workers to the big strike that became known as the CFR Railways Grivița Strike of 1933.

As the negotiations failed, the government feared a general strike, so it declared a state of siege in Bucharest and other cities. Gheorghiu-Dej was arrested during the night of 14–15 February 1933.

===In prison===
Gheorghiu-Dej was sentenced to prison in the same year by a military court, serving time in Doftana and in other facilities. In 1935–1936 he was detained at Ocnele Mari Prison, together with Chivu Stoica. In 1936 he was elected to the party&#x27;s Central Committee and became leader of the &quot;prison faction&quot; of the communist party (party members who were incarcerated in Romania, a term distinguishing them from party members living in exile, mainly in the Soviet Union: the &quot;Muscovite faction&quot;).

As a known activist, he was detained at Târgu Jiu internment camp during all of Ion Antonescu&#x27;s regime and most of World War II period, and escaped only on 10 August 1944, a few days before the fall of the regime. He became general secretary in 1944 after the Soviet occupation, but did not consolidate his power until 1952, after he purged Ana Pauker and her &quot;Muscovite faction&quot; comrades from power. Ana Pauker had been the unofficial leader of the Party since the end of the war.

While in prison, Gheorghiu-Dej met Nicolae Ceaușescu. They were imprisoned after a rally organized by the communist party, of which both Ceaușescu and Gheorghiu-Dej were members. Gheorghiu-Dej taught Ceaușescu in prison Marxist-Leninist theories and principles, and kept him close as Gheorghiu-Dej steadily gained power after their release from prison in 1944. During 1946–1947, he was a member of Romania&#x27;s Gheorghe Tătărescu-led delegation to the Paris Peace Conference.

==Political career==

===Under Soviet directives===
On 30 December 1947, Gheorghiu-Dej and Prime Minister Petru Groza forced King Michael I to abdicate. Years later, Albanian Communist leader Enver Hoxha alleged that Gheorghiu-Dej personally pulled a gun on the King and threatened to kill him unless he gave up the throne. Hours later, Parliament, fully dominated by Communists and their allies after the elections held a year earlier, abolished the monarchy and declared Romania a People&#x27;s Republic. From this moment onward, Gheorghiu-Dej was &quot;de facto&quot; the most powerful man in Romania.

Soviet influence in Romania under Joseph Stalin favored Gheorghiu-Dej, largely seen as a local leader with strong Marxist-Leninist principles. The economic influence of Moscow was protected by the creation of the &quot;&quot;Sov-Rom&quot; companies&quot;, which directed Romania&#x27;s commercial exchanges to unprofitable markets (mainly the Soviet Union). Up until Stalin&#x27;s death and even afterwards, Gheorghiu-Dej did not amend repressive policies, such as the works employing penal labor on the Danube-Black Sea Canal. On orders from Gheorghiu-Dej, Romania implemented also the massive forced collectivization of land in the rural areas. 

=== Creation of heavy industry ===

Gheorghiu-Dej became the architect of a new semi-autonomous foreign and economic policy under the Warsaw Pact and CAER at the end of the sixth decade. He decided to create a heavy industry, an initiative that contradicted the Muscovite plans that had reserved for Romania the role of granary of the communist bloc. Thus, the Galați Steel Plant was created, the construction of which was to be made with funds from the IMF. Production was based on iron ore imported from India and Australia. In 1952, construction began of the Borzești Petrochemical Platform with the first combine (Refinery no. 10) and the related city of Onești, mostly with the workforce of political prisoners. Also, in 1953, the Bârlad Bearing Company was put into operation, which later developed reaching a number of approx. 9,000 employees, about 1/9 of the city&#x27;s population (approx. 80,000 inhabitants in 1989).

Romania became one of the world&#x27;s leading steel-producing countries, the machine building industry expanded considerably, and the chemical industry was overdeveloped, with an oil refining capacity far in excess of domestic raw material production. Romania began to produce, at high cost prices but of inferior quality, civil and military aircraft, tanks, maritime vessels, helicopters, automobiles and computers.

A large-scale development was achieved by three industrial branches: the steel industry , the petrochemical industry and the machine building industry. Romania, lacking sufficient sources of domestic raw materials, was forced to rely on imports, sometimes obtained at extremely high prices. In addition, the decrease in demand for steel, of machine tools and petrochemical products on the world market, in the last decade of the Gheorghiu-Dej regime, limited the possibilities of exporting Romanian industrial products and, implicitly, massively reduced the foreign exchange funds thus obtained. The lack of competitiveness of Romanian products, mainly due to their poor quality and outdated technologies, forced Romania to sell its industrial goods at prices lower than their production costs, mostly on Third World markets and often within barter or credit exchanges.

===Personal rule===
The first five years of the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic saw a period of collective leadership, with fellow traveler Groza serving as prime minister. However, in 1952, Groza stepped down from the premiership and became head of state as Chairman of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly. Gheorghiu-Dej succeeded him, becoming the first Communist to hold the post. He thus combined the two most powerful posts in Romania in his own hands, with full Soviet approval.

Gheorghiu-Dej briefly gave up the first secretaryship of the Communist Party in 1954 to Gheorghe Apostol, retaining the premiership. However, he was still the actual leader of Romania, and he regained the party leadership in 1955, at the same time handing the premiership to Chivu Stoica. In 1961, he became head of state as the president of the newly created State Council.

Gheorghiu-Dej was at first unsettled by Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s reforms in the new process of De-Stalinization. He then became the architect of Romania&#x27;s semi-autonomous foreign and economic policy within the Warsaw Pact and the Comecon, in the late 1950s, notably by initiating the creation of a heavy industry in Romania which went against Soviet directions for the Eastern Bloc as a whole (e.g., the new large-scale steel plant in Galați, which relied on iron resources imported from India and Australia). Ironically, Romania under Gheorghiu-Dej was once considered one of the most loyal among the Soviet satellites, and thus there is a tendency to forget &quot;who first established the pattern of foreign policy openness and &#x27;liberalness&#x27; coupled with domestic repression.&quot; The ideological steps undertaken were made clear by the ousting of the &quot;Sov-Rom&quot; companies, together with the toning down of Soviet-Romanian common cultural ventures. In 1958 the Red Army withdrew its last troops from Romania (a personal achievement of Gheorghiu-Dej). The official &quot;History of Romania&quot; made then reference to a Romanian Bessarabia, as well as other topics which tensed relations between the two communist countries. Moreover, the final years of Dej&#x27;s regime saw the publishing of Karl Marx - newly discovered - texts dealing with Russia&#x27;s imperial policy in previously Romanian and now Soviet regions.

Yet, the Securitate was still Dej&#x27;s instrument of choice, and Romania joined the other Warsaw Pact countries&#x27; wave of repression after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 – incidentally, Hungarian leader Imre Nagy was shortly detained on Romanian soil.

In his late years, Gheorghiu-Dej established diplomatic relations with the First World, including the United States. Such steps were highly encouraged by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had come to see Romania as an almost friendly Communist country in the Cold War context (1963). Also, many political prisoners were released in 1964.

===Interaction with the West===

In the early years of Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s rule, Romania&#x27;s relations with the West were tense, marked by accusations of United States espionage and Romanian human rights violations. There were also low levels of trade between Romania and the West, as Romania tied itself to the Soviet Union and the other satellite nations; in 1950, Romania&#x27;s economic plan involved 89% of trade to be solely with the Soviet Bloc.

Later, however, Romania&#x27;s willingness to trade with the West became more apparent. For example, 1952 saw the first publication of the journal &quot;Romanian Foreign Trade&quot;, which offered opportunities to Western traders to buy Romanian goods, such as petroleum and grain. Western publications also recognized the potential for Romania to sell its products on the world market. An article from &quot;The Times&quot; of 29 August 1953 wrote: &quot;[Romania] could, for instance, it is thought, obtain higher prices on the world market for much of what she is forced to export to Russia, foodstuffs included, in return for machinery and aid.&quot; As Gheorghiu-Dej realized, if Romania were able to trade with the West the standard of living would likely rise.

From 1953, the West gradually relaxed their export controls, which had limited the products that the U.S., Great Britain, and France could export to Eastern Europe. Gheorghiu-Dej, eager to establish interaction between Romania and the West, relaxed travel restraints on Western diplomats in Bucharest and allowed Western journalists more access to Romania. In early 1954, Romania also appealed to Great Britain about having talks to resolve Romania&#x27;s outstanding claims, to which Great Britain agreed in December of that year.

Romania&#x27;s foreign policy towards the West was closely tied to its policy toward the Soviet Union; Romania could only develop trading with the West if it asserted its independence from the intensely anti-West Soviet Union. Gheorghiu-Dej realized this, and thus emphasized Romania&#x27;s sovereignty. In the Second Party Congress, which opened on 23 December 1955, Gheorghiu-Dej gave a five-hour speech in which he stressed the idea of national communism and Romania&#x27;s right to follow its own interests, rather than be forced to follow another&#x27;s (referring to the Soviet Union). Gheorghiu-Dej also discussed opening up trade with the West. In an attempt to increase the dialogue between Romania and the West, in 1956 Gheorghiu-Dej instructed the new ambassador to the U.S. to meet with both Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and then with President Dwight D. Eisenhower. As a result of these meetings, the U.S. Department of State expressed interest in increasing the interaction between the two nations, including possibly establishing a library in Bucharest.Romania&#x27;s interaction with the West temporarily decreased, however, with the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and the violent response of the Soviet Union to the uprising. Still, Gheorghiu-Dej continued to strengthen the independence from the Soviet Union. For example, Romanian schools dropped the Russian language requirement. And, obviously, Romania endorsed the Moscow Declaration of 1957 which stated that &quot;Socialist countries base their relations on the principles of complete equality, respect for territorial integrity, state independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in one another&#x27;s affairs… The socialist states also advocate the general expansion of economic and cultural relations with all other countries…&quot; These statements coincided with Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s claims to national sovereignty and independence.

In fact, by 1957 Romania had substantially increased its Western trade; in that year trade with the West had increased to 25% of Romania&#x27;s total trade. By the early 1960s, Romania under Gheorghiu-Dej was more industrialized and productive. After World War II 80% of the population had worked in agriculture, but by 1963, 65% did. And, despite the decrease in hands working the land, agricultural productivity had actually increased. Additionally, Gheorghiu-Dej had successfully begun a strong shift in trade towards the West, further separating it from the Soviet Union; Romania imported much of its industrial equipment from West Germany, Great Britain, and France. This trade pattern followed Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s economic plan, which he made clear to Great Britain and France in 1960, when he sent his head of foreign intelligence to Paris and London in order to clarify Romania&#x27;s desire to interact with the West and disregard Comecon orders.

By 1964 Gheorghiu-Dej had made a trading agreement with the U.S. that allowed Romania to buy industrial products from them. The agreement came as a result of U.S. businesses&#x27; complaints that they were losing money to Western Europe. During his presidency, President John F. Kennedy, concerned with these businesses&#x27; losses, used his powers to increase trade between the U.S. and Eastern Europe, a policy which President Lyndon Johnson also followed.

Thus, Gheorghiu-Dej greatly increased trade with the West, making Romania the first Soviet Bloc country to trade with the West, completely independently. Through his policy of national sovereignty, Gheorghiu-Dej increased the popularity of Romania in the West. National U.S. publications moved away from reports in the early 1950s of human rights abuses and oppression, towards articles from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s of Romanian de-satellization. In the early 1960s, &quot;The Times&quot; also reported often on Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s and Romania&#x27;s increased economic ties with the West. Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s successful efforts to expand Romania&#x27;s foreign relations, especially those with the West, were evident at his March 1965 funeral, attended by 33 foreign delegations, including a special French envoy sent by General Charles de Gaulle. Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s policies set the stage for his successor, Nicolae Ceaușescu, to carry Romania&#x27;s new course even further.

== Death and legacy ==

Gheorghiu-Dej died of lung cancer in Bucharest on 19 March 1965. Gheorghe Apostol has claimed that Gheorghiu-Dej himself designated him party leader in waiting; in any case many perceived him as such in 1965. But Prime Minister Ion Gheorghe Maurer, who had developed hostility towards him, made sure that Apostol was prevented from taking power, rallying the Party leadership instead around longtime Gheorghiu-Dej protégé Nicolae Ceaușescu. Securitate general Ion Mihai Pacepa, who defected to the United States in 1978, wrote that Ceaușescu had allegedly told him about &quot;ten international leaders the Kremlin killed or tried to kill&quot;; Gheorghiu-Dej was among them.

Gheorghiu-Dej was buried in a mausoleum in Liberty Park (now Carol Park) in Bucharest. In 1991, after the Romanian Revolution, his body was exhumed and reburied at Bellu Cemetery. The Polytechnic Institute of Bucharest, renamed to Polytechnic Institute &quot;Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej&quot; Bucharest in his honor, is now known as the Politehnica University of Bucharest. In the early 1950s, one of the Sectors of Bucharest (roughly, the present-day Sector 6) was named after him. The city of Onești was once named &quot;Gheorghe-Gheorghiu Dej&quot;. Also, the Russian city of Liski was, from 1965 to 1990, named &quot;Georgiu-Dezh&quot; in his honor.

Gheorghiu-Dej was married to Maria Alexe and they had two daughters, (1928–1987) and Constantina (1931–2000).

<doc id="342058" wikidata="Q467258" url="?curid=342058" title="Gimbal lock">
<text>Gimbal lock is the loss of one degree of freedom in a multi-dimensional mechanism at certain alignments of the axes. In a three-dimensional three-gimbal mechanism, gimbal lock occurs when the axes of two of the gimbals are driven into a parallel configuration, &quot;locking&quot; the system into rotation in a degenerate two-dimensional space.

The term gimbal-&quot;lock&quot; can be misleading in the sense that none of the individual gimbals are actually restrained. All three gimbals can still rotate freely about their respective axes of suspension. Nevertheless, because of the parallel orientation of two of the gimbals&#x27; axes, there is no gimbal available to accommodate rotation about one axis, leaving the suspended object effectively locked (i.e. unable to rotate) around that axis.

The problem can be generalized to other contexts, where a coordinate system loses definition of one of its variables at certain values of the other variables.

==Gimbals==
A gimbal is a ring that is suspended so it can rotate about an axis. Gimbals are typically nested one within another to accommodate rotation about multiple axes.

They appear in gyroscopes and in inertial measurement units to allow the inner gimbal&#x27;s orientation to remain fixed while the outer gimbal suspension assumes any orientation. In compasses and flywheel energy storage mechanisms they allow objects to remain upright. They are used to orient thrusters on rockets.

Some coordinate systems in mathematics behave as if they were real gimbals used to measure the angles, notably Euler angles.

For cases of three or fewer nested gimbals, gimbal lock inevitably occurs at some point in the system due to properties of covering spaces.

==In engineering==
While only two specific orientations produce exact gimbal lock, practical mechanical gimbals encounter difficulties near those orientations. When a set of gimbals is close to the locked configuration, small rotations of the gimbal platform require large motions of the surrounding gimbals. Although the ratio is infinite only at the point of gimbal lock, the practical speed and acceleration limits of the gimbals—due to inertia (resulting from the mass of each gimbal ring), bearing friction, the flow resistance of air or other fluid surrounding the gimbals (if they are not in a vacuum), and other physical and engineering factors—limit the motion of the platform close to that point.

===In two dimensions===

Gimbal lock can occur in gimbal systems with two degrees of freedom such as a theodolite with rotations about an azimuth (horizontal angle) and elevation (vertical angle). These two-dimensional systems can gimbal lock at zenith and nadir, because at those points azimuth is not well-defined, and rotation in the azimuth direction does not change the direction the theodolite is pointing.

Consider tracking a helicopter flying towards the theodolite from the horizon. The theodolite is a telescope mounted on a tripod so that it can move in azimuth and elevation to track the helicopter. The helicopter flies towards the theodolite and is tracked by the telescope in elevation and azimuth. The helicopter flies immediately above the tripod (i.e. it is at zenith) when it changes direction and flies at 90 degrees to its previous course. The telescope cannot track this maneuver without a discontinuous jump in one or both of the gimbal orientations. There is no continuous motion that allows it to follow the target. It is in gimbal lock. So there is an infinity of directions around zenith for which the telescope cannot continuously track all movements of a target. Note that even if the helicopter does not pass through zenith, but only &quot;near&quot; zenith, so that gimbal lock does not occur, the system must still move exceptionally rapidly to track it, as it rapidly passes from one bearing to the other. The closer to zenith the nearest point is, the faster this must be done, and if it actually goes through zenith, the limit of these &quot;increasingly rapid&quot; movements becomes &quot;infinitely&quot; fast, namely discontinuous.

To recover from gimbal lock the user has to go around the zenith – explicitly: reduce the elevation, change the azimuth to match the azimuth of the target, then change the elevation to match the target.

Mathematically, this corresponds to the fact that spherical coordinates do not define a coordinate chart on the sphere at zenith and nadir. Alternatively, the corresponding map &quot;T&quot;2→&quot;S&quot;2 from the torus &quot;T&quot;2 to the sphere &quot;S&quot;2 (given by the point with given azimuth and elevation) is not a covering map at these points.

===In three dimensions===


Consider a case of a level-sensing platform on an aircraft flying due north with its three gimbal axes mutually perpendicular (i.e., roll, pitch and yaw angles each zero). If the aircraft pitches up 90 degrees, the aircraft and platform&#x27;s yaw axis gimbal becomes parallel to the roll axis gimbal, and changes about yaw can no longer be compensated for.

===Solutions===
This problem may be overcome by use of a fourth gimbal, actively driven by a motor so as to maintain a large angle between roll and yaw gimbal axes. Another solution is to rotate one or more of the gimbals to an arbitrary position when gimbal lock is detected and thus reset the device.

Modern practice is to avoid the use of gimbals entirely. In the context of inertial navigation systems, that can be done by mounting the inertial sensors directly to the body of the vehicle (this is called a strapdown system) and integrating sensed rotation and acceleration digitally using quaternion methods to derive vehicle orientation and velocity. Another way to replace gimbals is to use fluid bearings or a flotation chamber.

===On Apollo 11===
A well-known gimbal lock incident happened in the Apollo 11 Moon mission. On this spacecraft, a set of gimbals was used on an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The engineers were aware of the gimbal lock problem but had declined to use a fourth gimbal. Some of the reasoning behind this decision is apparent from the following quote:

They preferred an alternate solution using an indicator that would be triggered when near to 85 degrees pitch.

Rather than try to drive the gimbals faster than they could go, the system simply gave up and froze the platform. From this point, the spacecraft would have to be manually moved away from the gimbal lock position, and the platform would have to be manually realigned using the stars as a reference.

After the Lunar Module had landed, Mike Collins aboard the Command Module joked &quot;How about sending me a fourth gimbal for Christmas?&quot;

===Robotics===

In robotics, gimbal lock is commonly referred to as &quot;wrist flip&quot;, due to the use of a &quot;triple-roll wrist&quot; in robotic arms, where three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point.

An example of a wrist flip, also called a wrist singularity, is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot&#x27;s wrist to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the end effector. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, the end effector, and the process.

The importance of avoiding singularities in robotics has led the American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems – Safety Requirements to define it as &quot;a condition caused by the collinear alignment of two or more robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities&quot;.

==In applied mathematics==

The problem of gimbal lock appears when one uses Euler angles in applied mathematics; developers of 3D computer programs, such as 3D modeling, embedded navigation systems, and video games must take care to avoid it.

In formal language, gimbal lock occurs because the map from Euler angles to rotations (topologically, from the 3-torus &quot;T3&quot; to the real projective space RP3, which is the same as the space of rotations for three-dimensional rigid bodies, formally named SO(3)) is not a local homeomorphism at every point, and thus at some points the rank (degrees of freedom) must drop below 3, at which point gimbal lock occurs. Euler angles provide a means for giving a numerical description of any rotation in three-dimensional space using three numbers, but not only is this description not unique, but there are some points where not every change in the target space (rotations) can be realized by a change in the source space (Euler angles). This is a topological constraint – there is no covering map from the 3-torus to the 3-dimensional real projective space; the only (non-trivial) covering map is from the 3-sphere, as in the use of quaternions.

To make a comparison, all the translations can be described using three numbers formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3, as the succession of three consecutive linear movements along three perpendicular axes formula_4, formula_5 and formula_6 axes. The same holds true for rotations: all the rotations can be described using three numbers formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9, as the succession of three rotational movements around three axes that are perpendicular one to the next. This similarity between linear coordinates and angular coordinates makes Euler angles very intuitive, but unfortunately they suffer from the gimbal lock problem.

===Loss of a degree of freedom with Euler angles===
A rotation in 3D space can be represented numerically with matrices in several ways. One of these representations is:
:formula_10

An example worth examining happens when formula_11. Knowing that formula_12 and formula_13, the above expression becomes equal to:
:formula_14

Carrying out matrix multiplication:
:formula_15

And finally using the trigonometry formulas:
:formula_16

Changing the values of formula_7 and formula_9 in the above matrix has the same effects: the rotation angle formula_19 changes, but the rotation axis remains in the formula_6 direction: the last column and the first row in the matrix won&#x27;t change. The only solution for formula_7 and formula_9 to recover different roles is to change formula_8.

It is possible to imagine an airplane rotated by the above-mentioned Euler angles using the X-Y-Z convention. In this case, the first angle - formula_7 is the pitch. Yaw is then set to formula_25 and the final rotation - by formula_9 - is again the airplane&#x27;s pitch. Because of gimbal lock, it has lost one of the degrees of freedom - in this case the ability to roll.

It is also possible to choose another convention for representing a rotation with a matrix using Euler angles than the X-Y-Z convention above, and also choose other variation intervals for the angles, but in the end there is always at least one value for which a degree of freedom is lost.

The gimbal lock problem does not make Euler angles &quot;invalid&quot; (they always serve as a well-defined coordinate system), but it makes them unsuited for some practical applications.

===Alternate orientation representation===
The cause of gimbal lock is the representation of orientation in calculations as three axial rotations based on Euler angles. A potential solution therefore is to represent the orientation in some other way. This could be as a rotation matrix, a quaternion (see quaternions and spatial rotation), or a similar orientation representation that treats the orientation as a value rather than three separate and related values. Given such a representation, the user stores the orientation as a value. To quantify angular changes produced by a transformation, the orientation change is expressed as a delta angle/axis rotation. The resulting orientation must be re-normalized to prevent the accumulation of floating-point error in successive transformations. For matrices, re-normalizing the result requires converting the matrix into its nearest orthonormal representation. For quaternions, re-normalization requires performing quaternion normalization.

<doc id="342063" wikidata="Q205596" url="?curid=342063" title="Austin Allegro">
<text>The Austin Allegro is a small family car that was manufactured by the Austin-Morris division of British Leyland (BL) from 1973 until 1982. The same vehicle was built in Italy by Innocenti between 1974 and 1975 and sold as the Innocenti Regent. The Allegro was designed as a replacement for the Austin 1100 and 1300 models. In total, 642,350 Austin Allegros were produced during its 10-year production life, most of which were sold on the home market, less than a third of 2.1 million 1100s and 1300s sold in the previous 11 years.

It was built and sold by British Leyland alongside the hatchback Austin Maxi (launched in 1969) and the 1971 rear-wheel-drive Morris Marina. All three were eventually replaced by the Austin Maestro in 1983. 

==Design==
British Leyland used a saloon design for the Allegro rather than a hatchback, as the company had decided that the Austin Maxi should have a hatchback as its unique selling point.
The Allegro used front-wheel drive, with the familiar A-Series engine with a sump-mounted transmission. The higher-specification models used the SOHC E-Series engine from the Maxi, in 1500 cc and 1750 cc displacements. The two-box saloon bodyshell was suspended using the new Hydragas system (derived from the previous Hydrolastic system used on the 1100/1300).
Stylistically, it went against the sharp-edged styling cues largely led by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro that were becoming fashionable, and featured rounded panel work. The original styling proposal, by Harris Mann, had the same sleek, wedge-like shape of the Princess, but because British Leyland management, keen to control costs, wanted to install the existing E-Series engine and bulky heating system from the Marina, it became impossible to incorporate the low bonnet line as envisaged: the bodyshell began to look more and more bloated and tubby. This was acceptable to BL, however, which according to Jeff Daniels&#x27; book &quot;British Leyland, The Truth About The Cars&quot;, published in 1980, wanted to follow the Citroën approach of combining advanced technology with styling that eschewed mainstream trends in order to create long-lasting &quot;timeless&quot; models. Its unfashionable shape was thus not a problem to the company. The final car bore little resemblance to Mann&#x27;s original concept that had originally been conceived as an 1100/1300 reskin.
With the Allegro, the BL avoided the full extent of badge engineering that had defined the marketing of its predecessor, which was mostly sold as an Austin although it was badged under almost all of the brands which BMC/BL owned, but it nevertheless introduced in September 1974 an upmarket Allegro, branded as the Vanden Plas 1500/automatic. This featured a prominent grille at the front and an interior enhanced by a range of modifications designed to attract traditionally inclined customers, including: special seats upholstered in real leather, with reclining backrests; deep-pile carpets; extra sound insulation; a new instrument panel in walnut; walnut folding tables for the rear passengers; nylon headlining; and for the luggage, a fully trimmed boot. In 1974, a time when the UK starting price for the Austin Allegro was given as £1159 (£11,731.77 in 2018 money), BL was quoting, at launch, a list price of £1951 (£19,748.65 in 2018) for the Vanden Plas 1500. The Allegro name was not used on this version.
Early Allegro models featured a &quot;quartic&quot; steering wheel, which was rectangular with rounded sides. This was touted as allowing extra room between the base of the steering wheel and the driver&#x27;s legs. The quartic steering wheel was unpopular, and was dropped in 1974 when the SS model was replaced by the HL. The VP 1500 was never introduced with one, despite it being featured in the owner&#x27;s manual. Despite this feature only having appeared on certain models for a limited time, the Allegro has always been associated with the criticism that it &quot;had a square steering wheel&quot;. It could now be seen as being ahead of its time as today many cars have squared off lower section steering wheels and some Formula 1 cars have square steering wheels. Some other BL cars from this period were fitted with a semi-quartic steering wheel, such as the Rover SD1.

In April 1975 a three-door estate car version was added to the range. Allegros were now coming off the production line with the same conventional steering wheel as the Morris Marina, although the company waited till early June 1975 to announce, rather quietly, the demise of the Allegro&#x27;s quartic steering wheel, presumably to give time for older cars to emerge from the sales and distribution network. Similar to the two-door saloon, the Allegro estate had a coachline and also featured a rear wash-wipe. The spare wheel was housed under the rear load floor area. It was only in production for about 100 days before the arrival of the Series 2 model, making Series I Allegro estate rarer than most other models in the range.

There was a similar situation in New Zealand, where the New Zealand Motor Corporation, which at the time had CKD kit assembly plants in Newmarket and Panmure, Auckland, and Petone, Wellington, began Allegro assembly in 1975 with the circular steering wheel. Only a few hundred &#x27;Mark Ones&#x27;, among the first locally-built car models to have a factory-fitted heated rear window, were built before the &#x27;Mark Two&#x27; was launched. Most Allegros sold in New Zealand had the 1300 cc A-series OHV engine and four-speed manual gearbox. Later, the 1.5-litre OHC engine was offered with a four-speed automatic &#x27;box, but this was eventually dropped. NZMC, moving away from UK-sourced cars to models from its Honda franchise (it began Civic assembly in 1976, with the Accord following in 1978), later rationalised Allegro output to offer just two paint colours, metallic brown or solid dark blue, with a cream vinyl roof and brown interior trim. One batch of 48 &#x27;Mark Three&#x27; CKD kits was shipped from England after NZMC had decided to drop the Allegro in 1980, and these were assembled and sold, also in brown or cream; these rare cars have four round headlights rather than two square units, and different tail lights, plus a restyled dashboard.

The Allegro was fitted with 13&quot; pressed-steel wheels fitted with 145 tyres, 155 on 1750, Sport and Vanden Plas derivatives.

==Allegro 2 (1975–1979)==
Launched in time for the London Motor Show in October 1975, the Allegro 2 had the same bodyshells but featured a new grille, reversing lights on most models and some interior changes to increase rear seat room. The estate gained a new coachline running over the wing top lip and window edges. Changes were also made to the suspension, braking, engine mounts and drive shafts.

Since the original Allegro had been launched more than two years earlier, several of BL&#x27;s key rivals in Europe had launched new competitors - these included the MK2 Ford Escort, as well as the groundbreaking and highly acclaimed Volkswagen Golf. A popular Japanese rival, the 120Y generation of the Datsun Sunny, had also been launched in Europe soon after the Allegro. General Motors had also introduced the Vauxhall Chevette, a slightly smaller car, but which competed with larger rivals due to the practicality of its hatchback body.

At the end of 1976 British Leyland confirmed that it was holding exploratory talks with trades union representatives concerning the possible transfer of Allegro production from Longbridge to the company&#x27;s plant at Seneffe in Belgium. The Belgian plant was already assembling the cars for continental European markets using CKD kits shipped from the UK. The stated objective of the transfer was to free up capacity at Longbridge for the manufacture of the forthcoming ADO88 Mini replacement. In the event, the ADO88 project was abandoned and the eventual Mini replacement, the less ambitiously engineered Austin Metro, did not go on sale for another four years. Whether for reasons of politics or of customer demand or of cost, at a time of rapid currency realignment, Allegros for the UK market continued to be manufactured in the UK; the Belgian plant was closed in the early 1980s, by which time Allegro demand in continental Europe had faltered and BL&#x27;s Austin-Morris division clearly had more production capacity than product demand.

Some models of Allegro 2 made for non-UK markets were equipped with four round headlights, rather than the usual two rectangular units.

Only weeks before the launch of the Allegro 3, 1979 saw the release of the 1.7l Allegro Equipe; a two-door sport style model in silver with red and orange hockey stick-shaped cheatlines and alloy wheels manufactured by GKN. The car was unveiled to the press at Sherburn-in-Elmet in North Yorkshire without the distinctive trim. The Equipe was intended to compete with the Golf GT and the Escort RS; by now though the aging Allegro with its lack of hatchback and dated styling struggled against these offerings and sales were poor.

==Allegro 3 (1979–1982)==


The Allegro 3, introduced at the end of 1979, used the &quot;A-Plus&quot; version of the 1.0-litre A-Series engine (developed for the forthcoming new Metro), and featured some cosmetic alterations in an attempt to keep the momentum going, but by then the Allegro was outdated, and was now up against high-tech opposition in the form of the Ford Escort III and Vauxhall Astra Mk.1/Opel Kadett D, both launched within a year of the Allegro&#x27;s facelift and both featured hatchback bodies with front-wheel-drive. The cosmetic alterations were fairly minimal; the Allegro 3 gained a new grille with the revised Leyland badge; it carried the Allegro 3 name, bore a larger bumper and gained additional side indicators. The interior was modernised with new components such as a new round four spoke steering wheel. By now, however, British Leyland was working on an all-new car to replace the Allegro and Maxi during the early 1980s - the LC10 - which would eventually emerge as the Austin Maestro.

British Leyland entered the small hatchback market – pioneered during the 1970s by the likes of the Renault 5 and Volkswagen Polo, with its Metro which was launched in October 1980. The Metro would be built at the Longbridge plant which had just been expanded to provide adequate production capacity for the new car. But with BL hoping to sell more than 100,000 Metros a year in Britain alone, more capacity for production was needed and production of the Allegro and the Mini were pruned back as a result. The base models of the slightly larger Triumph Acclaim, the first product of BL&#x27;s alliance with Honda introduced in 1981 also acted as a substitute for the Allegro until the Maestro launched.

After 1980, the Allegro failed to feature in the top 10 best selling new cars in Britain, barely a decade since its predecessor had been Britain&#x27;s most popular new car, though this fall in sales was compensated by the large sales figures achieved by the smaller Metro, as well as the fact that the slightly larger Triumph Acclaim was among Britain&#x27;s top 10 selling cars by 1982.

The Vanden Plas models were rebranded as the 1.5 and the 1.7, the 1.5 having a twin carburettor 1500 cc engine and a manual gearbox, while the 1.7 had a single carburettor 1750cc engine and an automatic gearbox.

Some models of Allegro 3 (the early HL and later HLS models) were equipped with four round headlights, rather than the more usual two rectangular ones.

Allegro production, which had lasted for nearly a decade, finally finished in March 1982. Its successor, the Austin Maestro, went into production in November 1982 and was officially launched on 1 March 1983. The backlog of unsold Allegro 3 models remained sufficient to stock dealerships into 1983, well after the Maestro had launched.

==Reputation==
Upon its launch the Allegro was not particularly badly received by critics, but the gearchange drew criticism and the &quot;quartic&quot; steering wheel &quot;comprising four curves joined together by four straight lines, similar to the shape of a television screen&quot;, fitted partly in order to compensate for the shortage of space between the driver and the rather low steering column, was widely derided by motoring journalists, especially when faced with the manufacturer&#x27;s insistence that this curious steering wheel design was &quot;avant garde and high-tec&quot;. In other respects the car was somewhat underdeveloped, and a number of design flaws plagued the early models, earning it the nickname of the &#x27;All Aggro&#x27;, which intensified over the next few years as well publicised stories about its build quality and reliability emerged. Most of these were fixed in the Allegro 2 edition of the car, launched in 1975, by which time a slightly smaller round steering wheel had quietly been substituted for the &quot;quartic&quot; original. Nevertheless, the car never quite managed to shake off its initial reputation.

In spite of all of this bad press, the Allegro was still a very popular car. As late as 1979, six years after its launch, it was the fifth-best-selling new car in Britain.

Sales in its final years were disappointing, and by 1981 it had fallen out of the top 10 as more buyers were choosing two newer BL products: the similar-sized and more viable Triumph Acclaim, and the smaller Austin Metro.

In his book &quot;Crap Cars&quot;, Richard Porter placed the Allegro second worst in his list, beaten only by the VW Beetle. Porter said &quot;the only bit of the Allegro they got even vaguely right was the rust-proofing&quot;.

Despite this, the Allegro picked up a reputation for rust problems during its life. This was probably due to association with many other cars of the period (both from BL and other manufacturers) which had poor rust-proofing. An early edition of &quot;What Car?&quot; ran a feature on the then new Allegro, including an interview with staff at a BL dealership, who were asked if any problems occurred with the car in service. They replied that the car suffered from rust problems to its rear subframe. However, the staff thought they were being asked about the 1100/1300 car, which had been out of production for five years. Nonetheless, the magazine went on to report on the Allegro&#x27;s non-existent rust problems, creating a serious image problem.

The poor reputation of the car and the inefficient production and management techniques in British Leyland at the time at which it was produced have meant that the Austin Allegro has become associated with waste, inefficiency and poor quality. In &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s Car Years&quot; Jeremy Clarkson compares the Allegro to the Morris Marina, concluding that the Marina was in fact a worse car than the Allegro due to its relative lack of technical ambition and innovation. Clarkson noted that while the Allegro had initially been intended as a forward-looking design to compete with technically advanced European cars such as the Citroën GS, its development budget was only around half that of the much simpler Marina. In 2007, Sir Digby Jones, in criticising the inefficiencies of the Learning and Skills Council, said, &quot;It is what I call &#x27;the British Leyland model&#x27; – you put a lot of money in at the top, and an Austin Allegro comes out at the bottom&quot;.

Quality problems concerning the Allegro led to British Leyland making the training video &quot;The Quality Connection&quot;, outlining both superficial and dangerous issues that can arise from a lack of care and attention.

==Legacy==
The Allegro is generally considered amongst the most disreputable British Leyland models; some credibility was restored with its replacement the Maestro which was tipped as an adequate competitor to the Ford Escort, Vauxhall Astra and Volkswagen Golf. By the time of the Maestro&#x27;s launch, a string of poor quality models throughout the 1970s had damaged the reputation of British Leyland and the Austin brand with the Maestro selling fewer models over a greater number of years (605,000 over 12 years to 642,000 Allegros over eight years). In 1987, the Austin name was phased out after 82 years in favour of the Rover name, which hadn&#x27;t been tainted by some of the poorer products that had dented the reputation of the Austin brand.

In February 2006, it was reported that more than 1,000 Austin Allegros sold in the UK were still registered with the DVLA, a better survival rate than the more popular Morris Marina; most of which were dismantled for parts that were interchangeable with other British Leyland cars such as the MGB, Mini and Morris Minor. However, that figure had fallen to just 195 cars by February 2016 (excluding cars which were declared SORN), by 2023, that figure had fallen further to 36 cars still on the road in the UK. Part of this is down the Allegro&#x27;s suitability (in A-Series engine format) as an engine donor for Mini restorations which is why many Allegros were broken solely for their power units.

<doc id="342065" wikidata="Q300994" url="?curid=342065" title="Dusky dolphin">
<text>The dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) is a small oceanic dolphin found in coastal waters of the Southern Hemisphere. It is most closely related to the Pacific white-sided dolphin. The dolphin&#x27;s range is patchy, with major populations around South America, southwestern Africa, New Zealand, and various oceanic islands, with some sightings around southern Australia and Tasmania. Like its closest relative, the dusky dolphin has a multi-coloured pigmentation of black, grey, and white.

The dusky dolphin prefers cool currents and inshore waters, but can also be found offshore. It lives in a fission–fusion society where groups change size based on social and ecological conditions. The dolphin feeds on a variety of fish and squid species and has flexible hunting tactics. Mating is polygynandrous and several males will chase after a single female, the most fit being able to catch her and reproduce. Females raise their young in nursery groups. The dusky dolphin is known for its remarkable acrobatics, having a number of aerial behaviours. 

The dusky dolphin is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. It has been caught in gill nets and killed to be used as bait. It has been a popular tourist attraction and the object of whale watching tours. Both unregulated tours and mussel farms can interfere with the dolphin&#x27;s activities. 

==Taxonomy==
The dusky dolphin was described as &quot;Delphinus obscurus&quot; by John Edward Gray in 1828 from stuffed skins with skulls shipped from the Cape of Good Hope to the British Museum in 1827. However, Gray later wrote that a similar dolphin was described as &quot;Delphinus superciliosus&quot; by French surgeons and naturalists René Lesson and Prosper Garnot in 1826 based on a specimen near Tasmania. Lesson and Garnot did not keep the specimen for their description but only an illustration of it, and Gray and later taxonomists likely did not consider this significant enough for a new species. Meanwhile, Charles Darwin described a &quot;Delphinus fitzroyi&quot; from a specimen harpooned off Argentina in 1838, which would later be identified as this species. The species would gain its current name, &quot;Lagenorhynchus obscurus&quot;, from American biologist Frederick W. True in 1889.

===Phylogeny===
The genus &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot; includes the dusky dolphin, Pacific white-sided dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin, white-beaked dolphin, hourglass dolphin, and Peale&#x27;s dolphin, though genetic evidence finds that this grouping is not a natural (monophyletic) taxon. A 2019 study proposed that the dusky dolphin, together with the Pacific white-sided dolphin, hourglass dolphin, and Peale&#x27;s dolphin be moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Sagmatias&quot;, while a 2025 phylogenomic study found that &quot;Sagmatias&quot; as defined by the 2019 study is also not monophyletic, and instead suggested that the dusky and Pacific white-sided dolphin be classified under a new genus &quot;Aethalodelphis&quot;. The Society for Marine Mammalogy (SMM) still classifies these six species under &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot; as of 2025. 

The dusky dolphin is most closely related to the Pacific white-sided dolphin, and the two sister species diverged around 1.9–3.0 million years ago. Hybrids of dusky dolphins have been suggested based on observations and photographic evidence, including with a common dolphin and a southern right whale dolphin. Genetic evidence suggests that dusky dolphins originated in South American waters and spread eastward from Argentina across open ocean to southwestern Africa, oceanic islands, and New Zealand; the latter population appears to be the result of multiple dispersals. Most populations have low genetic diversity, with the Peruvian population being an exception.

The following cladogram is based on a phylogenomic study by Galatius and colleagues (2025):

===Subspecies===
Three dusky dolphin subspecies have been classified: the African dusky dolphin (&quot;Lagenorhynchus obscurus obscurus&quot;, Gray, 1828), Fitzroy&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;L. o. fitzroyi&quot;, Waterhouse, 1838), and the Peruvian/Chilean dusky dolphin (&quot;L. o. posidonia&quot;, Philippi, 1893). A fourth subspecies, &quot;L. o. superciliosus&quot; or the New Zealand dusky dolphin, has been proposed but is not accepted by the SMM.

==Description==

The dusky dolphin is a small and somewhat stocky species. Specimans in New Zealand have been recorded at a length of and a weight of for females and a length of and a weight of for males. Peruvian dolphins may be larger but this is based on small sample sizes. A female from Peru was measured at while a male measured .

Dusky dolphins have a visible boundary between the forehead and the short, pointed beak. Both the dorsal fin and flippers are curved, the former being more pointed. The dorsal fin of the male is broader and more curved. The teeth are small and conical, and number between 108 and 144. The dusky dolphin has a distinctive colouration that resembles the Pacific white-sided dolphin, with a dark grey or black upper side, orbital area, and beak; light grey face, chest area, and flank patch, and a white underside. The flank patch has an extension or blaze that reaches over the back and towards the blowhole. The dorsal fin is darker in front and lightens towards the back while the flippers are light grey with darker edges. The dusky dolphin differs from the Pacific white-sided dolphin in having a more slender skull and shorter blaze.

==Distribution==

The dusky dolphin has a discontinuous range in the Southern Hemisphere. The dolphins can be found off the coasts of western and southeastern South America, southwestern Africa, New Zealand, and some oceanic islands in the south Atlantic and Indian Ocean. They have also been sighted off southern Australia. 

Dusky dolphins are found throughout New Zealand waters, being most common on the eastern coasts, between East Cape on the North Island and Timaru/Oamaru on the South Island. They are sighted year-round in the stable, cold waters off the coast of the northern Canterbury Region. Off South America, they range from southern Peru to Cape Horn in the west and then up to around 36°S in the east, along with the Falkland Islands, where they are suggested to be less numerous. Around Africa, the dusky dolphin ranges from Lobito Bay, Angola in the north to False Bay, South Africa in the south. Within Australian waters, dusky dolphins have been recorded off Kangaroo Island, eastern Tasmania, and in the Bass Strait, although they are uncommon and may be transients from New Zealand. Dusky dolphins are also found around the islands of Tristan da Cunha, Prince Edward, Crozet, Île Amsterdam and Île Saint-Paul.

==Ecology and behaviour==

Dusky dolphins prefer cool, upwelling waters, as well as cold currents. They largely live in inshore waters and can be found up to the outer continental shelf and in similar zones in offshore islands. Dusky dolphins were recorded swimming up to and diving up to . Dolphins off Argentina and New Zealand move to and from shore between day and night and between seasons. Similarly, dolphins have been recorded to migrate seasonally between Kaikōura and Admiralty Bay, New Zealand. Around Kaikōura, the majority of individuals were seen only once in the area over the course of 30 years, suggesting a high occurrence of immigration and emigration.

Most studies of foraging and social behaviour in the species have occurred at Kaikōura, Admiralty Bay, and San Jorge Gulf, Argentina. Dusky dolphins live in a fission–fusion society, where individuals move in and out of groups depending on social and ecological conditions. At Kaikōura, group size can reach 1,000 dolphins, while in Admiralty Bay, they peak around only 50 dolphins. Groups form for different activities, including foraging, resting, travelling, and socialising. At Kaikōura, groups are larger during resting and smaller during foraging, while the reverse is true at San Jorge Gulf. At Admiralty, foraging leads to larger aggregations while resting does not appear to correlate with group size. While most associations between individuals are weak, long-term bonds do occur.

Dusky dolphins can be found in mixed groups with other cetacean species, including common dolphins, southern right whales, southern right whale dolphins, and pilot whales. Off Argentina, they have been found around bottlenose dolphins, but seem to ignore them, and may share feeding areas with Risso&#x27;s dolphins. Dusky dolphins also feed with non-cetacean species such as South American sea lions, kelp gulls, cormorants, terns, shearwaters, petrels, albatrosses, and Magellanic penguins off Argentina, as well as Australasian gannets, shearwaters, terns, gulls, spotted shags, New Zealand fur seals, spiny dogfish, and common threshers off New Zealand.

===Vocalisations and echolocation===
As with other oceanic dolphins, dusky dolphins produce three basic sounds; echolocative click trains, burst pulses and tonal whistles. Their echolocation signals are quick and broadband, much like in other whistle-producing species, and have two peaks: between 40 and 50 kHz at low frequency and between 80 and 110 kHz at high frequency. Burst pulses are similar to echolocation signals but the pauses between clicks are much shorter, at 0.5–10 milliseconds. They often consist of 2–14 clicks in succession and appear to be important for communication. Whistling is more common when dusky dolphins mingle with other dolphin species such as common dolphins. They are not often produced by New Zealand dolphins, and in one study which recorded vocalisations off both New Zealand and Argentina, no whistles were detected.

===Foraging===

Dusky dolphins mainly feed on fish and squid. Common fish species eaten include anchovies, lantern fish, pilchards, sculpins, hakes, horse mackerel, hoki, and red cod, while squids preyed on include those of the genera &quot;Nototodarus&quot;, &quot;Todarodes&quot;, and &quot;Loligo&quot;. Dusky dolphins are generally coordinated hunters, and their flexible foraging strategies can change depending on the environment. In Kaikōura Canyon, where deep oceanic waters meet the shore, dusky dolphins forage in deep scattering layers at night. They arrive at the hunting site individually and form groups of up to five when in the layer; these decrease back to single individuals as the layer descends.

In San Jorge Gulf and Admiralty Bay, dusky dolphins herd schools of fish into bait balls during the day. They use the water surface as a barrier for the fish as they circle around and below them and may also scare them using sound or by flashing their white bellies. The larger the group, the more effective they are in herding the school. These hunts may also involve other species, including other dolphins, seabirds, sharks, and pinnipeds. Common dolphins seem to participate in herding with dusky dolphins. By contrast, pinnipeds, sharks, and other predatory fish take food without helping in the hunt, and foraging by diving birds like gannets can make herding more difficult for dolphins. In San Jorge Gulf, bait herding occurs from October to January, while at Admiralty Bay, it takes place from August to November. From May to October in San Jorge Gulf and between May and July at Admiralty Bay, dusky dolphins are recorded to hunt deeper below the surface.

===Reproduction and parenting===
Dusky dolphins reach sexual maturity between four and eight years depending on the region. They have a polygynandrous mating system in which both males and females mate with multiple partners. Mating groups generally consist of multiple males and one female; at Kaikōura, they usually have a total of five members but can vary from 2–15. They can be found in both shallow and deep water but more often gather near shore. 

Within a mating group, the males pursue a female in a high-speed chase. Females seem to prefer males with great speed and agility over size, strength, or aggression, and try to evade males that are less energetic and lack social skill. Males also form alliances to catch females. Off Kaikōura, dusky dolphins have been found to contain scars and notches on their dorsal fins that are suggested to be caused by fighting over mates. However, one study in the same area did not observe male dusky dolphins in mating groups fighting amongst themselves nor controlling who can be part of the group, but did record interferences of copulations. During mating, female dusky dolphins usually take the top position. As with other species where females mate with multiple partners, male dusky dolphins have large testes for sperm competition. Dusky dolphins also engage in non-reproductive sexual behaviour, including homosexual behaviour, perhaps for greeting, communication, or strengthening social bonds. Dolphins having sex for social reasons tend to be more serene, with none of the high-speed chasing.

Female dusky dolphins off the coast of Peru were found to have pregnancies lasting over 12 months. Calves are born during the spring (August to October) off Peru, and in summer (November to February) off Argentina, South Africa and New Zealand. Females with calves tend to gather in nursery groups, which likely provide them more time to rest, as well as facilitate socialisation among the young. Calves learn to hunt from their mothers and nursery groups typically forage in shallow water as deeper water is too dangerous for young, particularly due to predators. Nursery groups segregate from mating groups, as adult males will aggressively chase mothers, leaving calves dazed and vulnerable. Conversely, females with calves will associate with non-breeding adults in large groups. Near Peru, calves may be weaned around 12 months, and the female can reproduce again less than four months after that.

===Aerial behaviour===

Dusky dolphins perform a number of aerial displays, which are classed into noisy, clean, acrobatic, and coordinated. Noisy leaps end in splashes upon re-entry and include backslaps, headslaps, sideslaps, tailslaps and belly flops. For clean leaps, the dolphin leaps with the body vertical and lands with little to no splashing. These include headfirst re-entries and &quot;humpings&quot;, both of which involve the dolphin leaving the water, arching its back and then flipping the tail before plunging headfirst. For humpings, the dolphin is arched after the nose enters the water and before the tail leaves. Acrobatic leaps are complex and consist of head-over-tail flips or somersaults and spins, both of which can cause splashes. Coordinated leaps are synchronised between two or more individuals. 

These leaps likely have a number of functions based on type. One study in Admiralty Bay found that clean leaping may function in hunting prey, coordinated leaps signalled the end of the hunts and may also serve a social function, and noisy leaps appear to cause more activity among the group. The ability to make these leaps is apparently not inborn but learnt; calves are recorded to learn in the following order: noisy leaps, clean leaps, coordinated leaps, and acrobatic leaps.

===Predators, parasites and diseases===
Dusky dolphins are preyed on by orcas and large sharks, and may swim into shallower water to reduce the risk of being ambushed by them. Dusky dolphins are also susceptible to internal parasitism by certain nematode, cestode, and trematode species. Off Peru, parasites include those of the genera &quot;Nasitrema&quot; and &quot;Anisakis&quot;, and &quot;Phyllobothrium delphini&quot;, &quot;Braunina cordiformis&quot;, and &quot;Pholeter gasterophilus&quot;, while a study of dolphins off Patagonia found that the most common parasites were &quot;Anisakis simplex&quot;, &quot;Braunina cordiformis&quot;, and species of the genus &quot;Hadwenius&quot;. Diseases recorded in the species include poxvirus, papillomavirus and various genital diseases.

==Interactions with humans==

Dusky dolphins are popular attractions for whale watching tours. In Patagonia, dusky and Commerson&#x27;s dolphins have been attracting more and more viewers, and 90% of boat trips encountered dusky dolphins in 2001, up from 25% two years before. Dolphin watching in this area started as an alternative to whale watching, which was mostly based on that of the southern right whale. Dusky dolphin watching is also popular in New Zealand, whose dolphin-watching industry started in the late 1980s as a side attraction to sperm whales. Whale and dolphin watching tours in the country have risen to around 75 official tour operators by 2010. Attractions include viewing and swimming with dusky dolphins, notably in Kaikōura and Marlborough Sounds.

The presence of vessels has the potential to disrupt dusky dolphin activities. Dolphins may lose energy interacting with or avoiding vessels—energy they could use for socialising and feeding— and they appear to spend more time resting when the boats are around. Boats also create noise pollution which makes it harder for dolphins to communicate. While dusky dolphin tourism is a larger industry in New Zealand than it is in Argentina, tourism has less of an effect on dolphins in the former than the latter. This is likely due to more regulations and guidelines, and a limited number of permits. By contrast, dolphin watching is less regulated in Argentina, with no permits or guidelines, and this has led to vessels interfering more in their activities. Dusky dolphins can also benefit from encounters with boats by riding the waves produced by them (bow-riding), which saves energy while travelling.

The effect of mussel farming on dusky dolphins has been studied in Admiralty Bay. Apparently, dolphins rarely enter farms, and when they do, they quickly swim through them. The building of mussel farms seems to have led to a decline in the number and group size of dolphins passing through the bay and they herd prey less when near the farms. Mussel farms are also obstacles for echolocation.

==Status==
The dusky dolphin is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List because; &quot;... Although information is sparse, several Dusky Dolphin populations are large, seemingly stable, and not subject to high levels of anthropogenic threats&quot;. The dusky dolphin is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, meaning that it has an &quot;unfavourable conservation status&quot; and may require international cooperation organised by tailored agreements. The total population is unknown. Off New Zealand dusky dolphins may number around 12,000, while over 6,500 dolphins have been counted from Valdés Peninsula to Puerto Deseado, Argentina. One study found that dusky dolphins in Golfo Nuevo had an increasing population trend, with an average population growth of over four percent between 2004 and 2022. 

Dusky dolphins may fall victim to the illegal small cetacean fisheries of Peru and Chile. The expansion of these fisheries could have started in Peru when the anchoveta fishery collapsed in 1972. Off New Zealand, gill nets have also been a threat, though bycatches seem to have decreased since the 1970s and 1980s. In Peru, dusky dolphins are killed in large numbers (10,000–15,000 per year) and used as shark bait or for human consumption, which has led to a status of Vulnerable for the Peruvian subspecies. Compared to more northern-living marine mammals, dusky dolphins are less contaminated by marine pollutants like DDT and persistent organic pollutants.

<text>John James (c. 1673 – 15 May 1746) was a British architect particularly associated with Twickenham in west London, where he rebuilt St Mary&#x27;s Church and also built a house for James Johnson, Secretary of State for Scotland, later Orleans House and since demolished. Howard Colvin&#x27;s assessment of him was that of &quot;a competent architect, but he lacked inventive fancy, and his buildings are for the most part plain and unadventurous in design&quot;.

==Life==
The son of a Hampshire parson also named John James, he attended the Holy Ghost School, Basingstoke, of which his father was headmaster. He was then apprenticed in 1690 to Matthew Banckes, Master Carpenter to the Crown 1683–1706, whose niece he married, and he lived for a while at Hampton Court Palace. He was employed at Greenwich, where in 1718 he became joint Clerk of the Works with Hawksmoor, whom he succeeded as Surveyor of the Fabric of Westminster Abbey, where he completed Hawksmoor&#x27;s west tower. In the interim he was appointed master carpenter at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, where he assisted Sir Christopher Wren and succeeded him in 1723 as Surveyor of the Fabric of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He was Master of the Carpenters&#x27; Company in 1734.

In 1714 he started work on St George&#x27;s Church, Tiverton, which was finally completed in 1733.

In 1716 he replaced James Gibbs as one of the two surveyors to the Commissioners for the Building of Fifty New Churches – the other being Nicholas Hawksmoor. He designed one church for the commissioners – St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square – and collaborated with Hawksmoor on the design of two others, St John Horsleydown in Southwark and St Luke Old Street. At St Alfege&#x27;s Church in Greenwich, he recased the medieval tower and added a steeple in 1730, the rest of the church having been entirely rebuilt by Hawksmoor for the commissioners in 1712–14. James also designed St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Rotherhithe in 1714–15 and St Lawrence, Whitchurch near Edgware around the same time. He also re-clad the medieval tower of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster 1735–37 in a &#x27;papery gothick manner&#x27; (VCH Middlesex Vol.XIII City of Westminster Part 1 P.144).

He was the professional on site for the construction of East India House, Leadenhall Street, London, to designs by the merchant and amateur architect Theodore Jacobsen, 1726–29.

Among several buildings in and around Twickenham, John James designed St. Mary&#x27;s Church after it collapsed in 1713 (with the exception of its surviving west tower). 
Also in south-east London, James designed Wricklemarsh, &quot;a pioneer Palladian mansion&quot; (Colvin) and in fact his only Palladian-style structure, for Sir Gregory Page in 1723. He was also probably the architect for the building now known as Ranger&#x27;s House, Blackheath, London (c.1722–23).

The house he designed for himself around 1725 – Warbrook in Eversley, Hampshire – is one of the few surviving houses built by an eighteenth-century architect for his own use. He may also have designed Hursley House, Hursley, Hampshire, for (later, Sir) William Heathcote, and Barnsley House in Gloucestershire is now usually attributed to him, c. 1720.

==Writings==
He published a pamphlet (1736) in the pamphlet war over the design of Westminster Bridge, for which he had submitted a design, which, though not accepted by the Commissioners, was accounted &quot;clearly and well described&quot;. Competent in Latin, French and Italian, he translated Andrea Pozzo&#x27;s treatise on perspective as &quot;Rules and Examples of Perspective, proper for Painters and Architects&quot; (1707, 2nd edition c. 1725) and from the French of Claude Perrault, &quot;A Treatise of the Five Orders of Columns in Architecture&quot; (1708), and from the French of Dezallier d&#x27;Argenville, &quot;The Theory and Practice of Gardening&quot; (1712, 2nd edition 1728, 3rd edition 1743. Thus John James can be seen as one of the intermediaries who made Baroque Continental practice in architecture, decorative painting and formal garden planning available to English patrons and craftsmen.

<doc id="342077" wikidata="Q326938" url="?curid=342077" title="Dick Tiger">
<text>Richard Ihetu (August 14, 1929 – December 14, 1971), professionally known as Dick Tiger was a Nigerian professional boxer who held the undisputed middleweight and light-heavyweight championships.

Tiger emigrated to Liverpool, England to pursue his boxing career and later to the United States. Tiger was Igbo and served as a Lieutenant in the Biafran army during the Nigerian Civil War, primarily training soldiers in hand-to-hand combat.

Tiger was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991. &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine named him Fighter of the Year in 1962 and 1965, while the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) named him Fighter of the Year in 1962 and 1966. In 1996, Tiger was voted as one of the best boxers of the 1960s, The later in 1998, Tiger was put in the book of &quot;Best boxers of the 20th Century&quot;. In 2002, Tiger was voted by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine as the 31st greatest fighter of the last 80 years. His first world title win in 1962 was ranked the 15th most memorable moment in Nigerian sports history since 1960 by &quot;Premium Times&quot; in 2020, the highest ranked combat sports-related moment.

==Professional career==
Tiger became a two-time undisputed world middleweight champion and helped keep boxing alive during the 1950s boxing industry recession. Tiger won the WBA middleweight title when he beat Gene Fullmer on October 23, 1962, and the light heavyweight title in 1966 when he dethroned José Torres of Puerto Rico.

Prior to these accomplishments, however, Tiger seemed condemned to poor management and a resulting lack of exposure. In 1957, using Liverpool as his fighting base, Tiger was fighting on undercards for small purses, when by fortune, facing off against popular favorite Terry Downes at Shoreditch Town Hall, he walked away with a TKO after six heats. New management saw to it certain &quot;errors in his style&quot; were corrected, and in another year, Tiger had taken 17 of 19 fights and won the British Middleweight title. In 1959, handled by the independent Jersey Jones, Tiger came to America, to face adversity in a whole, new way. Jersey Jones, resisting the influences of Madison Square Garden, brokered deals for Tiger by himself, which in the short run, cost them both. In an independent promotion at Edmonton, Alberta, Tiger&#x27;s Empire belt was lost in a more-than questionable 15 round nod to local challenger Wilf Greaves. The decision as rendered, had first been called a draw; appalled, Jones demanded a recount of the cards, which boomeranged, showing the fight, dominated by Tiger, as a win for Greaves. Tiger, sincere and honorable in his dealings, often found this virtuous approach not reciprocated, particularly in North America.

A. J. Liebling, impressed in witnessing Tiger&#x27;s 1962 performance versus Henry Hank of Detroit, described the fighter&#x27;s appearance thus, &quot;... a chest like an old-fashioned black office safe, dropping away to a slender waist, big thighs, and slender legs; he boxed classically, his arms tight against his sides at the beginning of a punch, his savagely methodical blows moving in short arcs and straight lines.&quot;

Such a description was similarly evoked, albeit in simpler terms, by Tiger&#x27;s contemporaries.
Gene Fullmer: &quot;Tiger was a rough guy...I went to Nigeria to fight him, and, of course, I don&#x27;t know what happened over there...He beat me. He beat me bad. My mother and father could have been judge and referee, and I couldn&#x27;t have won a round...&quot;
Joey Giardello: &quot;I thank Dick Tiger because Dick Tiger was a man and Dick Tiger gave (a title shot) to me. He didn&#x27;t have to give it to me. He could have give it to somebody else.&quot;
An additional comment from Giardello, in the form of a sarcastic &quot;bon mot&quot;, showed contemporary respect for Tiger as a fellow battler. The pair fought four times in all, the last two of these in swapping the middleweight title. Every fight went the distance, meaning that in terms of time, Dick Tiger and Joey Giardello contended face to face for two and a half hours. Prior to one of these latter encounters, when asked by the press if Giardello, a classic boxer, planned to trade punches with Tiger, Giardello squelched this with, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t trade stamps with him.&quot;

Numerous accounts of Tiger as both man and fighting man, describe a solid, decent, un-nuanced person. Unsurprisingly, a very Western gimmick, the literal &quot;power of the press&quot;, or perhaps of Madison Avenue, appears lost on him. Contender Joey Archer, a scientific middleweight of uncommon speed, launched a small space ad campaign directed at Tiger. The ads, using copy such as &quot;I&#x27;m a middleweight, and I&#x27;ve licked every man I ever fought, including you&quot;, were employed to create a sensation and perhaps a groundswell toward securing Archer a title fight. Tiger had already signed to fight Emile Griffith, and an Archer ad admonished, &quot;The Middleweight Champion should meet the best middleweight (not a welterweight).&quot; Archer carried his cause to talk shows, even to the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, was photographed taunting an angry, caged tiger at the Bronx Zoo. Whether this bombast registered in any negative way, or even impacted Dick Tiger&#x27;s pride, history never discovered after Emile Griffith won Tiger&#x27;s middleweight belt from him, making Tiger a non-player in the drama. Joey Archer shifted his attentions and, from 1966, Tiger campaigned as a full light heavyweight.

After decisioning Jose Torres to win title honors, Tiger then defended his crown against Torres and Montanan Roger Rouse, before coming up short against Bob Foster of Albuquerque, New Mexico, sometimes described as a veteran, although he was only 26 with 33 fights. Tiger was the veteran, at nearly 40 and his 4th last fight.. The left hook Foster used to dethrone Tiger in an instant, was rated among &quot;The 10 Deadliest Punches of the Last 25 Years&quot; in 1975. The power in the one-punch K.O. made such an impact upon Garden promoters, it was felt that a rematch would do poor business. This attitude forced Tiger to contend for the right to regain his crown, and saw him matched against up-and-comer Frankie DePaula, who was coming off five consecutive knockouts. The fight to qualify against Foster was, for its first four rounds, a war which saw both men go down twice, and was selected by Ring magazine as &quot;Fight of the Year&quot;. Though Dick Tiger took the decision, having proved his mettle, ill treatment on the American side seemed to cling, as Frankie DePaula, the man he had defeated, was inexplicably given the chance at Bob Foster.

==Retirement and death==
Tiger travelled from his home of Nigeria to Liverpool, Western England and eventually the United States in the latter parts of his career, making a big contribution to boxing.

After retiring from boxing, Tiger worked as a guard at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. One day, he felt a strong pain in his back. Tested by doctors, he was diagnosed with liver cancer.

He had been banned by the Nigerian government in his country because of his involvement in the Biafran movement; however, the ban was lifted immediately after news about his condition arrived in Nigeria. He died of liver cancer on 14 December 1971 in Aba, Nigeria, at the age of 42.

<text>A gimbal is a pivoted support that permits rotation of an object about an axis. A set of three gimbals, one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used to allow an object mounted on the innermost gimbal to remain independent of the rotation of its support (e.g. vertical in the first animation). For example, on a ship, the gyroscopes, shipboard compasses, stoves, and even drink holders typically use gimbals to keep them upright with respect to the horizon despite the ship&#x27;s pitching and rolling.

The gimbal suspension used for mounting compasses and the like is sometimes called a Cardan suspension after Italian mathematician and physicist Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576) who described it in detail. However, Cardano did not invent the gimbal, nor did he claim to. The device has been known since antiquity, first described in the 3rd c. BC by Philo of Byzantium, although some modern authors support the view that it may not have a single identifiable inventor.

== History ==

The gimbal was first described by the Greek inventor Philo of Byzantium (280–220 BC). Philo described an eight-sided ink pot with an opening on each side, which can be turned so that while any face is on top, a pen can be dipped and inked — yet the ink never runs out through the holes of the other sides. This was done by the suspension of the inkwell at the center, which was mounted on a series of concentric metal rings so that it remained stationary no matter which way the pot is turned.

In Ancient China, the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) inventor and mechanical engineer Ding Huan created a gimbal incense burner around 180 AD. There is a hint in the writing of the earlier Sima Xiangru (179–117 BC) that the gimbal existed in China since the 2nd century BC. There is mention during the Liang dynasty (502–557) that gimbals were used for hinges of doors and windows, while an artisan once presented a portable warming stove to Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690–705) which employed gimbals. Extant specimens of Chinese gimbals used for incense burners date to the early Tang dynasty (618–907), and were part of the silver-smithing tradition in China.

The authenticity of Philo&#x27;s description of a cardan suspension has been doubted by some authors on the ground that the part of Philo&#x27;s &quot;Pneumatica&quot; which describes the use of the gimbal survived only in an Arabic translation of the early 9th century. Thus, as late as 1965, the sinologist Joseph Needham suspected Arab interpolation. However, Carra de Vaux, author of the French translation which still provides the basis for modern scholars, regards the &quot;Pneumatics&quot; as essentially genuine. The historian of technology George Sarton (1959) also asserts that it is safe to assume the Arabic version is a faithful copying of Philo&#x27;s original, and credits Philon explicitly with the invention. So does his colleague Michael Lewis (2001). In fact, research by the latter scholar (1997) demonstrates that the Arab copy contains sequences of Greek letters which fell out of use after the 1st century, thereby strengthening the case that it is a faithful copy of the Hellenistic original, a view recently also shared by the classicist Andrew Wilson (2002).

The ancient Roman author Athenaeus Mechanicus, writing during the reign of Augustus (30 BC–14 AD), described the military use of a gimbal-like mechanism, calling it &quot;little ape&quot; (&quot;pithêkion&quot;). When preparing to attack coastal towns from the sea-side, military engineers used to yoke merchant-ships together to take the siege machines up to the walls. But to prevent the shipborne machinery from rolling around the deck in heavy seas, Athenaeus advises that &quot;you must fix the &quot;pithêkion&quot; on the platform attached to the merchant-ships in the middle, so that the machine stays upright in any angle&quot;.

After antiquity, gimbals remained widely known in the Near East. In the Latin West, reference to the device appeared again in the 9th century recipe book called the &quot;Little Key of Painting&quot;&#x27; (&quot;mappae clavicula&quot;). The French inventor Villard de Honnecourt depicts a set of gimbals in his sketchbook (see right). In the early modern period, dry compasses were suspended in gimbals.

== Applications ==
=== Inertial navigation ===

In inertial navigation, as applied to ships and submarines, a minimum of three gimbals are needed to allow an inertial navigation system (stable table) to remain fixed in inertial space, compensating for changes in the ship&#x27;s yaw, pitch, and roll. In this application, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) is equipped with three orthogonally mounted gyros to sense rotation about all axes in three-dimensional space. The gyro outputs are kept to a null through drive motors on each gimbal axis, to maintain the orientation of the IMU. To accomplish this, the gyro error signals are passed through &quot;resolvers&quot; mounted on the three gimbals, roll, pitch and yaw. These resolvers perform an automatic matrix transformation according to each gimbal angle, so that the required torques are delivered to the appropriate gimbal axis. The yaw torques must be resolved by roll and pitch transformations. The gimbal angle is never measured.
Similar sensing platforms are used on aircraft.

In inertial navigation systems, gimbal lock may occur when vehicle rotation causes two of the three gimbal rings to align with their pivot axes in a single plane. When this occurs, it is no longer possible to maintain the sensing platform&#x27;s orientation.

=== Rocket engines ===
In spacecraft propulsion, rocket engines are generally mounted on a pair of gimbals to allow a single engine to vector thrust about both the pitch and yaw axes; or sometimes just one axis is provided per engine. To control roll, twin engines with differential pitch or yaw control signals are used to provide torque about the vehicle&#x27;s roll axis.

=== Photography and imaging ===

Gimbals are also used to mount everything from small camera lenses to large photographic telescopes.

In portable photography equipment, single-axis gimbal heads are used in order to allow a balanced movement for camera and lenses. This proves useful in wildlife photography as well as in any other case where very long and heavy telephoto lenses are adopted: a gimbal head rotates a lens around its center of gravity, thus allowing for easy and smooth manipulation while tracking moving subjects.

Very large gimbal mounts in the form 2 or 3 axis altitude-altitude mounts are used in satellite photography for tracking purposes.

Gyrostabilized gimbals which house multiple sensors are also used for airborne surveillance applications including airborne law enforcement, pipe and power line inspection, mapping, and ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance). Sensors include thermal imaging, daylight, low light cameras as well as laser range finder, and illuminators.

Gimbal systems are also used in scientific optics equipment. For example, they are used to rotate a material sample along an axis to study their angular dependence of optical properties.

=== Film and video ===

Handheld 3-axis gimbals are used in stabilization systems designed to give the camera operator the independence of handheld shooting without camera vibration or shake. There are two versions of such stabilization systems: mechanical and motorized.

Mechanical gimbals have the sled, which includes the top &quot;stage&quot; where the camera is attached, the &quot;post&quot; which in most models can be extended, with the monitor and batteries at the bottom to counterbalance the camera weight. This is how the Steadicam stays upright, by simply making the bottom slightly heavier than the top, pivoting at the gimbal. This leaves the center of gravity of the whole rig, however heavy it may be, exactly at the operator&#x27;s fingertip, allowing deft and finite control of the whole system with the lightest of touches on the gimbal.

Powered by three brushless motors, motorized gimbals have the ability to keep the camera level on all axes as the camera operator moves the camera. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) responds to movement and utilizes its three separate motors to stabilize the camera. With the guidance of algorithms, the stabilizer is able to notice the difference between deliberate movement such as pans and tracking shots from unwanted shake. This allows the camera to seem as if it is floating through the air, an effect achieved by a Steadicam in the past. Gimbals can be mounted to cars and other vehicles such as drones, where vibrations or other unexpected movements would make tripods or other camera mounts unacceptable. An example which is popular in the live TV broadcast industry, is the Newton 3-axis camera gimbal.

=== Marine chronometers ===

The rate of a mechanical marine chronometer is sensitive to its orientation. Because of this, chronometers were normally mounted on gimbals, in order to isolate them from the rocking motions of a ship at sea.

== Gimbal lock ==
Gimbal lock is the loss of one degree of freedom in a three-dimensional, three-gimbal mechanism that occurs when the axes of two of the three gimbals are driven into a parallel configuration, &quot;locking&quot; the system into rotation in a degenerate two-dimensional space.

The word lock is misleading: no gimbal is restrained. All three gimbals can still rotate freely about their respective axes of suspension. Nevertheless, because of the parallel orientation of two of the gimbals&#x27; axes there is no gimbal available to accommodate rotation about one axis.

<text>The Troad ( or ; , &quot;Troáda&quot;) or Troas (; , &quot;Trōiás&quot; or , &quot;Trōïás&quot;) is a historical region in northwestern Anatolia. It corresponds with the Biga Peninsula (Turkish: &quot;Biga Yarımadası&quot;) in the Çanakkale province of modern Turkey. Bounded by the Dardanelles to the northwest, by the Aegean Sea to the west and separated from the rest of Anatolia by the massif that forms Mount Ida, the Troad is drained by two main rivers, the Scamander (Karamenderes) and the Simois, which join at the area containing the ruins of Troy.

Mount Ida, called by Homer &quot;many-fountain&quot; (πολυπίδαξ), sourced several rivers, including Rhesos, Heptaporos, Caresus, Rhodios, Granicus (Granikos), Aesepus, Skamandros and Simoeis; these rivers were deified as a source of life by the Greeks, who depicted them on their coins as river-gods reclining by a stream and holding a reed.

== History ==

The Troad is first mentioned by that name in Hittite records as &quot;Taruiša&quot;. This identification was first put forth by Emil Forrer, but largely disputed by most Hittite experts until 1983 when Houwink ten Cate showed that two fragments were from the same original cuneiform tablet and in his discussion of the restored letter showed that &quot;Taruiša&quot; and &quot;Wiluša&quot; (Troy) were correctly placed in northwestern Anatolia.

Greek settlements flourished in Troas during the Archaic and Classical ages, as evidenced by the number of Greek &quot;poleis&quot; that coined money in their own names.

The region was part of the satrapy (province) of Hellespontine Phrygia of the Achaemenid Empire until its conquest by Alexander the Great. After this it fell to the Diadoch Seleucid Empire, and then passed to Rome&#x27;s ally, the kingdom of Pergamon. The Attalid kings of Pergamon (now Bergama) later ceded Mysia, including the territory of the Troad, to the Roman Republic, on the death of King Attalus III in 133 BC.
Under the Roman Empire, the territory of the Troad became part of the province of Asia, and later of the smaller Mysian province Hellespontus; it was important enough to have suffragan bishoprics, including Pionia (now Avcılar).

Under the later Byzantine Empire, it was included in the &quot;thema&quot; of the Aegean Islands.
Following its conquest by the Ottoman Empire, the Troad formed part of the sanjak of Biga.

== New Testament ==
The apostles Paul and Silas first visited Troas during their journey from Galatia to Macedonia. Paul also referred to Troas when he asked his fellow evangelist Timothy out of Ephesus, to bring the cloak he had left there, a journey of about . The changes from the story, being recounted as &quot;they&quot; to &quot;we&quot; in Acts 16 and Acts 20, imply that Paul was joined by Luke when he went through Troas.

<text>Aaahh!!! Real Monsters is an American animated television series developed by Klasky Csupo for Nickelodeon. It is the fifth Nicktoon after &quot;Doug&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; and &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;. The show focuses on three young monsters—Ickis, Oblina, and Krumm—who attend a school for monsters under a city dump and learn to frighten humans. Many of the episodes revolve around their zany hijinks after making it to the surface in order to perform &quot;scares&quot; as class assignments. The series premiered on October 29, 1994 and aired until November 16, 1997.

==Plot==
The episodes follow the adventures of Ickis, Oblina, and Krumm, three young monster friends attending a monster school whose headmaster is The Gromble.

The show is set in New York City, demonstrated throughout the series by the presences of the Empire State Building and the IND Subway System, and in the episode &quot;Monster Make-Over&quot; when Ickis refers to himself as &quot;the ugliest, slimiest, razor fanged, sharp clawed, monster menace &quot;this side of Newark&quot;!&quot; The dump the monsters inhabit is implied to be Fresh Kills Landfill, but never explicitly named in the series. The monster community includes a working economic system using toenails as currency.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
* (voiced by Charlie Adler) is a small red-violet monster with yellow eyes who is often mistaken for a rabbit due to his large ears. He is the son of Slickis, a famous scarer. He seems the most skittish of the monsters but is also a capable leader. Ickis looms and grows in size to scare, his eyes turn red and comes from a long line of loomers. Ickis&#x27;s constant goofing off and blatant disregard for rules are usually the focal point and source of his group&#x27;s troubles in most episodes. Another running gag in the series is that Ickis nearly exposes the Monster World to humans accidentally, which spells certain doom for monsterkind.
* (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh) is a black and white striped monster with big red lips, green eyes and black slit-shaped pupils shaped like an upside-down candy cane who comes from a wealthy monster family and is considered by The Gromble to be his best student. She is the brains of the group. Her methods of scaring humans is reaching within herself and pulling out her internal organs, and she has considerable talent for shapeshifting into various terrifying forms. She also has a talent for inducing nightmares in humans, by sticking her finger in their ear and tickling their brains while they sleep. When voicing Oblina, Christine Cavanaugh attempted to make the voice sound like a British version of the actress Agnes Moorehead.
* Krumm (voiced by David Eccles) is an orange-tan hairy monster whose eyeballs are not attached to his body, and are usually carried in his hands. If he requires the use of both hands, he can carry them in his mouth. When he sleeps, he keeps his eyes in a glass of water next to his bed. His most valuable tool in scaring is his overwhelming armpit stench, as well as using his eyeballs. A running gag in the series is that Krumm sometimes loses his eyeballs and has to get them back, once going so far as to make a fake head to keep from losing them.
* The Gromble (voiced by Gregg Berger) is a green-blue monster with two tufts of hair, four legs, a beard, and a tail. He wears a belt around his waist and a red pump on each of his four feet. While serving as the leader and principal of the dump, The Gromble teaches young monsters and evaluates them using the Viewfinder, a chair like projection device used to replay the scaring activities of students. Along with Ickis, he is one of the few monsters who can hear the Pool of Elders—the source of monster existence that is made of the very substance of fears.
* The Snorch (voiced by David Eccles) is the disciplinarian of the Monster Academy who works for The Gromble and is often seen with Zimbo. Though he mostly does not speak and only makes vocal effects, he once wore a voicebox translator whose voice was provided by Brock Peters. He operates three chambers labeled &quot;Something Bad&quot; (a hissing boiler-like room), &quot;Something Really Bad&quot; (a mechanical cyclops with sharp teeth) and &quot;You don&#x27;t want to know&quot; (a cheerful pink house with colorful flora).
* Zimbo (voiced by Tim Curry) is a bee-like monster with one mammal-like leg and a humanoid face with green hair. He is The Gromble&#x27;s assistant in his class and is always seen on the head of The Snorch. Zimbo appears to be petty and jealous of anyone becoming friends with The Snorch, although he too has been punished by him for misbehavior.
* Slickis (voiced by Billy Vera) is Ickis&#x27; father.
* Horvak (voiced by David Eccles) is Krumm&#x27;s father, who wears a black glove after he lost one of his eyes.
* Simon (voiced by Jim Belushi) is the series&#x27; recurring antagonist, a human who is determined to prove that monsters exist and wants to exterminate them. Before becoming a monster hunter, he tried to capture Bigfoot and built a giant robot. Belushi ad-libbed much of Simon&#x27;s dialogue.
* Bradley (voiced by Brett Alexander) is a human friend of the monsters.

==Production==
&quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; was created by Gábor Csupó and Peter Gaffney, and was the third animated series produced by Csupó&#x27;s company Klasky Csupo, which also created the animated shows &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;Duckman&quot; on USA Network. Before the final title was chosen, which took over five years, the series had the working titles &quot;Monsters&quot; and &quot;Real Monsters&quot;. The show was conceived after Csupó and his wife and creative partner Arlene Klasky were approached by the network Nickelodeon to create a follow-up series to &quot;Rugrats&quot;. Csupó was inspired to write a show about monsters because his own young children loved them. He also said he knew Nickelodeon would not want a series about human characters because everybody else was pitching shows about animals. Csupó drew some sketches of possible monsters on a piece of paper and successfully pitched the idea to the network: &quot;I wanted them silly and not too skillful – and the idea worked.&quot;

Nickelodeon programming director Herb Scannell said the character design in &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; was partially inspired by &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, a 1968 animated film that was, in turn, inspired by The Beatles. The character Gromble, in particular, bears a close resemblance to the Blue Meanie characters from that film. Director of the series Igor Kovalyov said the style was inspired by his earlier Soviet film &quot;Investigation Held by Kolobki&quot; which he and Gábor Csupó showed to the producers who then gave Kovalyov&#x27;s team a lot of creative freedom with the art direction and storyboarding. Csupó said some elements of the show have a look similar to the film noir genre, and called the city dump where the monster characters reside reminiscent of the visual style from the films &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) and &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985). The characters guest-starred in the 1999 &quot;Rugrats&quot; episode &quot;Ghost Story&quot;. Before that, David Eccles, the voice of Krumm, provided the monster voice coming from under Chuckie&#x27;s bed.

==Reception==
===Reviews===
Reviews for &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; were very positive. Josef Adalian of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; praised the show&#x27;s animation and sense of humor, although it was not as &quot;hip and witty&quot; as &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; or &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Although he felt the show would appeal to children over nine as well as adults, he said it may not appeal to those who &quot;react negatively to semi-scary sights and gags about body odor, physical punishment or abusive older siblings&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot; writer Matt Roush called it &quot;garish and blissfully silly&quot; and praised the show&#x27;s &quot;outrageous characters have just enough &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; grodiness, but tempered with exceptional sweetness&quot;. Ginny Holbert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called it a &quot;cute and clever&quot; series with &quot;wit and inventive creatures&quot;, and compared the animation to the work of artist Peter Max. Gannett News Service writer Mike Hughes called it a &quot;terrific cartoon series&quot;, and said the show&#x27;s &quot;wildly perverse humor&quot; had a &quot;distinctly European style&quot; that reflected Gábor Csupó&#x27;s Hungarian background.

&quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; writer Tom Feran called the show &quot;good fun&quot; and favorably compared the series&#x27; premise to that of the animated film &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. &quot;Boston Herald&quot; writer Frances Katz wrote, &quot;If there was ever a great title for a cartoon, it has to be Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;&#x27;.&quot; Not all reviews were positive. The November 1994 issue of &quot;Parenting&quot; magazine listed &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; as #1 in its top ten list of the worst new shows of the television season, describing it as &quot;Graphic and scatological; it&#x27;s just plain gross.&quot; Some media outlets pointed out similarities between &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; and &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot;, an MTV animated television series created by Danny Antonucci about a group of grotesque humanoid characters. Gábor Csupó rejected these comparisons and claims his show was more story- and character-driven with a different visual style, while Antonucci&#x27;s show was idea-driven. Csupó did not want &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; to be lumped together with &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot;, especially since that show received low ratings and negative reviews, lasting for 8 months, and that Danny Antonucci called it &quot;MTV&#x27;s dirty little secret&quot;.

===Awards===
The pilot episode of &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; won first prize for film animation producer for television at both the Houston Film Festival and Ottawa Film Festival. The series was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Animation in 1995 alongside &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; and &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;. The award ultimately went to &quot;Rugrats&quot;.

==Merchandising==
Mattel produced a series of &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; action figures in 1995. They each stand approximately 4 inches (10 cm) tall and include an action feature. Other products based on the cartoon include Fleer trading cards, books, plush toys, pens, hats, backpacks, notepads, cups, gum, and videos. At one point, General Mills also included small promotional flip books of Ickis, Krumm, Oblina, and The Gromble in its Cinnamon Toast Crunch breakfast cereal.

===Home media releases===
In 1995, selected episodes of &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; were released on VHS by Sony Wonder. Paramount Home Video re-released the tapes in 1997. The complete first and second seasons were released for PlayStation Network for viewing on the PlayStation 3 and PSP (PlayStation Portable) systems.

Nickelodeon and Amazon.com teamed up to release &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; and other Nickelodeon shows on manufactured-on-demand DVD-R discs available exclusively through Amazon.com&#x27;s CreateSpace arm.
&quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; sets, among others, were discontinued when Nick began releasing traditional DVDs of many of their series in association with Shout! Factory.

On March 22, 2011, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the home video rights to the series from Nickelodeon. They have subsequently released the first three seasons on DVD. The fourth and final season was released on June 10, 2014, as a Shout! Select title.

On October 8, 2013, Shout! Factory released the complete series set in Region 1.

In the United Kingdom, four volumes are available as exclusive releases in Poundland stores. Volume 1 contains the first nine episodes (five half-hours) from season 1. Volume 2 contains the first eight episodes (four half-hours) from season 2, while the remaining two volumes make up the first 16 episodes from season 3.

===Video games===

A video game based on the TV series was released for the Super NES and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. The game was developed by Realtime Associates and published by Viacom New Media in 1995. Ickis also appears in &quot;Nicktoons Racing&quot; for the PlayStation, PC, and Game Boy Advance yet is missing from the Game Boy Color version. Oblina has a cameo in all versions of &quot;Nicktoons Racing&quot; except the Game Boy Color version.

The characters are also created in full 3D for Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker&quot;.

Krumm appears as a Master Model in the Wii, PlayStation 2, and Game Boy Advance versions of &quot;&quot; while The Gromble is a Master Model in the Nintendo DS version.

Oblina and Krumm make a cameo appearance in the video game &quot;Nicktoons MLB&quot;.

Oblina is a playable character in the 2021 fighting video game &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl&quot; and the 2022 kart racing game &quot;Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway&quot;, voiced by Alex Cazares due to the death of her original voice actress, Christine Cavanaugh.

<text>Gullinbursti (Old Norse), meaning &quot;Gold Mane&quot; or &quot;Golden Bristles&quot;) is a boar in Norse mythology.

When Loki had Sif&#x27;s hair, Freyr&#x27;s ship Skíðblaðnir, and Odin&#x27;s spear Gungnir fashioned by the Sons of Ivaldi, he bet his own head with Brokkr that his brother Eitri (Sindri) would not have been able to make items to match the quality of those mentioned above.

So to make gifts to Freyr, Eitri threw a pig&#x27;s skin into a furnace as Brokkr worked on the bellows, and together they manufactured the boar Gullinbursti which had bristles in its mane that glowed in the dark.

The story of Gullinbursti&#x27;s creation is related in the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; section of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;.

According to &quot;Húsdrápa&quot;, Freyr rode Gullinbursti to Baldr&#x27;s funeral, while in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Snorri states that Freyr rode to the funeral in a chariot pulled by the boar.

The boar is also known as Slíðrugtanni (Old Norse: meaning &quot;Sharp Tooth&quot; or &quot;Fearsome Tooth&quot;) (sometimes anglicized to &quot;Slidrugtanni&quot;).

<doc id="342086" wikidata="Q868337" url="?curid=342086" title="War of the currents">
<text>The war of the currents was a series of events surrounding the introduction of competing electric power transmission systems in the late 1880s and early 1890s. It grew out of two lighting systems developed in the late 1870s and early 1880s: arc lamp street lighting running on high-voltage alternating current (AC), and large-scale low-voltage direct current (DC) indoor incandescent lighting being marketed by Thomas Edison&#x27;s company. In 1886, the Edison system was faced with new competition: an alternating current system initially introduced by George Westinghouse&#x27;s company that used transformers to step down from a high voltage so AC could be used for indoor lighting. Using high voltage allowed an AC system to transmit power over longer distances from more efficient large central generating stations. As the use of AC spread rapidly with other companies deploying their own systems, the Edison Electric Light Company claimed in early 1888 that high voltages used in an alternating current system were hazardous, and that the design was inferior to, and infringed on the patents behind, their direct current system.

In the spring of 1888, a media furor arose over electrical fatalities caused by pole-mounted high-voltage AC lines, attributed to the greed and callousness of the arc lighting companies that operated them. In June of that year Harold P. Brown, a New York electrical engineer, claimed the AC-based lighting companies were putting the public at risk using high-voltage systems installed in a slipshod manner. Brown also claimed that alternating current was more dangerous than direct current and tried to prove this by publicly killing animals with both currents, with technical assistance from Edison Electric. The Edison company and Brown colluded further in their parallel goals to limit the use of AC with attempts to push through legislation to severely limit AC installations and voltages. Both also colluded with Westinghouse&#x27;s chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.

By the early 1890s, the war was winding down. Further deaths caused by AC lines in New York City forced electric companies to fix safety problems. Thomas Edison no longer controlled Edison Electric, and subsidiary companies were beginning to add AC to the systems they were building. Mergers reduced competition between companies, including the merger of Edison Electric with their largest competitor, Thomson-Houston, forming General Electric in 1892. Edison Electric&#x27;s merger with their chief alternating current rival brought an end to &quot;the war of the currents&quot; and created a new company that now controlled three quarters of the US electrical business. Westinghouse won the bid to supply electrical power for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893 and won the major part of the contract to build Niagara Falls hydroelectric project later that year (partially splitting the contract with General Electric). DC commercial power distribution systems declined rapidly in numbers throughout the 20th century; the last DC utility in New York City was shut down in 2007.

==Background==

The war of the currents grew out of the development of two lighting systems; arc lighting running on alternating current and incandescent lighting running on direct current. Both were supplanting gas lighting systems, with arc lighting taking over large area/street lighting, and incandescent lighting replacing gas for business and residential indoor lighting.

===Arc lighting===
By the late 1870s, arc lamp systems were beginning to be installed in cities, powered by central generating plants. Arc lighting was capable of lighting streets, factory yards, or the interior of large buildings. Arc lamp systems used high voltages (above 3,000 volts) to supply current to multiple series-connected lamps, and some ran better on alternating current.

1880 saw the installation of large-scale arc lighting systems in several US cities including a central station set up by the Brush Electric Company in December 1880 to supply a length of Broadway in New York City with a 3,500–volt demonstration arc lighting system. The disadvantages of arc lighting were: it was maintenance intensive, buzzed, flickered, constituted a fire hazard, was really only suitable for outdoor lighting, and, at the high voltages used, was dangerous to work with.

===Edison&#x27;s direct current company===

In 1878 inventor Thomas Edison saw a market for a system that could bring electric lighting directly into a customer&#x27;s business or home, a niche not served by arc lighting systems. By 1882 the investor-owned utility Edison Illuminating Company was established in New York City. Edison designed his utility to compete with the then established gas lighting utilities, basing it on a relatively low 110-volt direct current supply to power a high resistance incandescent lamp he had invented for the system. Edison direct current systems would be sold to cities throughout the United States, making it a standard with Edison controlling all technical development and holding all the key patents. Direct current worked well with incandescent lamps, which were the principal load of the day. Direct-current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load-leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation. Direct-current generators could be easily paralleled, allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability. Edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption, but this meter worked only with direct current. Direct current also worked well with electric motors, an advantage DC held throughout the 1880s. The primary drawback with the Edison direct current system was that it ran at 110 volts from generation to its final destination giving it a relatively short useful transmission range: to keep the size of the expensive copper conductors down generating plants had to be situated in the middle of population centers and could only supply customers less than a mile from the plant.

===Westinghouse and alternating current===
In 1884 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania inventor and entrepreneur George Westinghouse entered the electric lighting business when he started to develop a DC system and hired William Stanley, Jr. to work on it. In 1885 he read an article in UK technical journal &quot;Engineering&quot; that described alternating current systems under development. By that time alternating current had gained a key advantage over direct current with the development of transformers that allowed the voltage to be &quot;stepped up&quot; to much higher transmission voltages and then dropped down to a lower end user voltage for business and residential use. The high voltages allowed a central generating station to supply a large area, up to long circuits. Westinghouse saw this as a way to build a truly competitive system instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents. The Edison DC system of centralized DC plants with their short transmission range also meant there was a patchwork of un-supplied customers between Edison&#x27;s plants that Westinghouse could easily supply with AC power. 

In 1885 Westinghouse purchased the US patents rights to a transformer developed by French engineer Lucien Gaulard (financed by British engineer John Dixon Gibbs). He imported several of these &quot;Gaulard–Gibbs&quot; transformers as well as Siemens AC generators to begin experimenting with an AC-based lighting system in Pittsburgh. That same year William Stanley used the Gaulard-Gibbs design and designs from the Hungarian Ganz company&#x27;s Z.B.D. transformer to develop the first practical transformer. The Westinghouse Electric Company was formed at the beginning of 1886. 

In March 1886 Stanley, with Westinghouse&#x27;s backing, installed the first multiple-voltage AC power system, a demonstration incandescent lighting system, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Expanded to the point where it could light 23 businesses along main street with very little power loss over 4000 feet, the system used transformers to step 500 AC volts at the street down to 100 volts to power incandescent lamps at each location. By fall of 1886 Westinghouse, Stanley, and Oliver B. Shallenberger had built the first commercial AC power system in the US in Buffalo, New York.

===The spread of AC===
By the end of 1887 Westinghouse had 68 alternating current power stations to Edison&#x27;s 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another competitor offering AC- and DC-based systems) had built 22 power stations. Thomson-Houston was expanding their business while trying to avoid patent conflicts with Westinghouse, arranging deals such as coming to agreements over lighting company territory, paying a royalty to use the Stanley AC transformer patent, and allowing Westinghouse to use their Sawyer-Man incandescent bulb patent. Besides Thomson-Houston and Brush there were other competitors at the time, including the United States Illuminating Company and the Waterhouse Electric Light Company. All of the companies had their own electric power systems, arc lighting systems, and even incandescent lamp designs for domestic lighting, leading to constant lawsuits and patent battles between themselves and with Edison.

===Safety concerns===

Elihu Thomson of Thomson-Houston was concerned about AC safety and put a great deal of effort into developing a lightning arrestor for high-tension power lines as well as a magnetic blowout switch that could shut the system down in a power surge, a safety feature the Westinghouse system did not have. Thomson also worried about what would happen with the equipment after they sold it, assuming customers would follow a risky practice of installing as many lights and generators as they could get away with. He also thought the idea of using AC lighting in residential homes was too dangerous and had the company hold back on that type of installation until a safer transformer could be developed.

Due to the hazards presented by high voltage electrical lines most European cities and the city of Chicago in the US required them to be buried underground. The City of New York did not require burying and had little in the way of regulation so by the end of 1887 the mishmash of overhead wires for telephone, telegraph, fire and burglar alarm systems in Manhattan were now mixed with haphazardly strung AC lighting system wires carrying up to 6,000 volts. Insulation on power lines was rudimentary, with one electrician referring to it as having as much value &quot;as a molasses covered rag&quot;, and exposure to the elements was eroding it over time. A third of the wires were simply abandoned by defunct companies and slowly deteriorating, causing damage to, and shorting out the other lines. Besides being an eyesore, New Yorkers were annoyed when a large March 1888 snowstorm (the Great Blizzard of 1888) tore down a large number of the lines, cutting off utilities in the city. This spurred on the idea of having these lines moved underground but it was stopped by a court injunction obtained by Western Union. Legislation to give all the utilities 90 days to move their lines into underground conduits supplied by the city was slowly making its way through the government but that was also being fought in court by the United States Illuminating Company, who claimed their AC lines were perfectly safe.

===Edison&#x27;s anti-AC stance===
As AC systems continued to spread into territories covered by DC systems, with the companies seeming to impinge on Edison patents including incandescent lighting, things got worse for the company. The price of copper was rising, adding to the expense of Edison&#x27;s low voltage DC system, which required much heavier copper wires than higher voltage AC systems. Thomas Edison&#x27;s own colleagues and engineers were trying to get him to consider AC. Edison&#x27;s sales force was continually losing bids in municipalities that opted for cheaper AC systems and Edison Electric Illuminating Company president Edward Hibberd Johnson pointed out that if the company stuck with an all DC system it would not be able to do business in small towns and even mid-sized cities. Edison Electric had a patent option on the ZBD transformer, and a 1886 confidential in-house report by electrical engineer Frank Sprague had recommended that the company go AC, but Thomas Edison was against the idea.

After Westinghouse installed his first large scale system, Edison wrote in a November 1886 private letter to Edward Johnson, &quot;Just as certain as death Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size, He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.&quot; Edison seemed to hold a view that the very high voltage used in AC systems was too dangerous and that it would take many years to develop a safe and workable system. Safety and avoiding the bad press of killing a customer had been one of the goals in designing his DC system and he worried that a death caused by a mis-installed AC system could hold back the use of electricity in general. Edison&#x27;s understanding of how AC systems worked seemed to be extensive. He noted what he saw as inefficiencies and that, combined with the capital costs in trying to finance very large generating plants, led him to believe there would be very little cost savings in an AC venture. Edison was also of the opinion that DC was a superior system (a fact that he was sure the public would come to recognize) and inferior AC technology was being used by other companies as a way to get around his DC patents.

In February 1888 Edison Electric president Edward Johnson published an 84-page pamphlet titled &quot;A Warning from the Edison Electric Light Company&quot; and sent it to newspapers and to companies that had purchased or were planning to purchase electrical equipment from Edison competitors, including Westinghouse and Thomson-Houston, stating that the competitors were infringing on Edison&#x27;s incandescent light and other electrical patents. 

===Execution by electricity===

As arc lighting systems spread, so did stories of how the high voltages involved were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead. One such story in 1881 of a drunken dock worker dying after he grabbed a large electric dynamo led Buffalo, New York dentist Alfred P. Southwick to seek some application for the curious phenomenon. He worked with local physician George E. Fell and the Buffalo ASPCA, electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs, to come up with a method to euthanize animals via electricity. Southwick&#x27;s 1882 and 1883 articles on how electrocution could be a replacement for hanging, using a restraint similar to a dental chair (an electric chair) caught the attention of New York State politicians who, following a series of botched hangings, were desperately seeking an alternative. An 1886 commission appointed by New York governor David B. Hill, which including Southwick, recommended in 1888 that executions be carried out by electricity using the electric chair.

There were early indications that this new form of execution would become mixed up with the war of currents. As part of their fact-finding, the commission sent out surveys to hundreds of experts on law and medicine, seeking their opinions, as well as contacting electrical experts, including Elihu Thomson and Thomas Edison. In late 1887, when death penalty commission member Southwick contacted Edison, the inventor stated he was against capital punishment and wanted nothing to do with the matter. After further prompting, Edison hit out at his chief electric power competitor, George Westinghouse, in what may have been the opening salvo in the war of currents, stating in a December 1887 letter to Southwick that it would be best to use current generated by &quot;&#x27;alternating machines,&#x27; manufactured principally in this country by Geo. Westinghouse&quot;. Soon after the execution by electricity bill passed in June 1888, Edison was asked by a New York government official what means would be the best way to implement the state&#x27;s new form of execution. &quot;Hire out your criminals as linemen to the New York electric lighting companies&quot; was Edison&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek answer.

==Anti-AC backlash==
As the number of deaths attributed to high voltage lighting around the country continued to mount, a cluster of deaths in New York City in the spring of 1888 related to AC arc lighting set off a media frenzy against the &quot;deadly arc-lighting current&quot; and the seemingly callous lighting companies that used it. These deaths included a 15-year-old boy killed on April 15 by a broken telegraph line that had been energized with alternating current from a United States Illuminating Company line; a clerk killed two weeks later by an AC line; and a Brush Electric Company lineman killed in May by the AC line he was cutting. The press in New York seemed to switch overnight from stories about electric lights vs gas lighting to &quot;death by wire&quot; incidents, with each new report seeming to fan public resentment against high voltage AC and the dangerously tangled overhead electrical wires in the city.

===Harold Brown&#x27;s crusade===

At this point an electrical engineer named Harold P. Brown, who at that time seemed to have no connection to the Edison company, sent a June 5, 1888 letter to the editor of the &quot;New York Post&quot; claiming the root of the problem was the alternating current (AC) system being used. Brown argued that the AC system was inherently dangerous and &quot;damnable&quot; and asked why the &quot;public must submit to constant danger from sudden death&quot; just so utilities could use a cheaper AC system.

At the beginning of attacks on AC, Westinghouse, in a June 7, 1888 letter, tried to defuse the situation. He invited Edison to visit him in Pittsburgh and said &quot;I believe there has been a systemic attempt on the part of some people to do a great deal of mischief and create as great a difference as possible between the Edison Company and The Westinghouse Electric Co., when there ought to be an entirely different condition of affairs&quot;. Edison thanked him but said &quot;My laboratory work consumes the whole of my time&quot;.

On June 8, Brown was lobbying in person before the New York Board of Electrical Control, asking that his letter to the paper be read into the meeting&#x27;s record and demanding severe regulations on AC including limiting voltage to 300 volts, a level that would make AC next to useless for transmission. There were many rebuttals to Brown&#x27;s claims in the newspapers and letters to the board, with people pointing out he was showing no scientific evidence that AC was more dangerous than DC. Westinghouse pointed out in letters to various newspapers the number of fires caused by DC equipment and suggested that Brown was obviously being controlled by Edison, something Brown continually denied.

A July edition of &quot;The Electrical Journal&quot; covered Brown&#x27;s appearance before the New York Board of Electrical Control and the debate in technical societies over the merits of DC and AC, noting that:

At a July meeting Board of Electrical Control, Brown&#x27;s criticisms of AC and even his knowledge of electricity was challenged by other electrical engineers, some of whom worked for Westinghouse. At this meeting, supporters of AC provided anecdotal stories from electricians on how they had survived shocks from AC at voltages up to 1000 volts and argued that DC was the more dangerous of the two.

====Brown&#x27;s demonstrations====
Brown, determined to prove alternating current was more dangerous than direct current, at some point contacted Thomas Edison to see if he could make use of equipment to conduct experiments. Edison immediately offered to assist Brown in his crusade against AC companies. Before long, Brown was loaned space and equipment at Edison&#x27;s West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, as well as laboratory assistant Arthur Kennelly.

Brown paid local children to collect stray dogs off the street for his experiments with direct and alternating current. After much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at Columbia College. With many participants shouting for the demonstration to stop and others walking out, Brown subjected a caged dog to several shocks with increasing levels of direct current up to 1,000 volts, which the dog survived. Brown then applied 330 volts of alternating current which killed the dog. Four days later he held a second demonstration to answer critics&#x27; claims that the DC probably weakened the dog before it died. In this second demonstration, three dogs were killed in quick succession with 300 volts of AC. Brown wrote to a colleague that he was sure this demonstration would get the New York Board of Electrical Control to limit AC installations to 300 volts. Brown&#x27;s campaign to restrict AC to 300 volts was unsuccessful but legislation did come close to passing in Ohio and Virginia.

====Collusion with Edison====
What brought Brown to the forefront of the debate over AC and his motives remain unclear, but historians note there grew to be some form of collusion between the Edison company and Brown. Edison records seem to show it was Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings who came up with the idea of using Brown and several New York physicians to attack Westinghouse and the other AC companies in retaliation for what Hastings thought were unscrupulous bids by Westinghouse for lighting contracts in Denver and Minneapolis. Hasting brought Brown and Edison together and was in continual contact with Brown. Edison Electric seemed to be footing the bill for some of Brown&#x27;s publications on the dangers of AC. In addition, Thomas Edison himself sent a letter to the city government of Scranton, Pennsylvania recommending Brown as an expert on the dangers of AC. Some of this collusion was exposed in letters stolen from Brown&#x27;s office and published in August 1889.

==Patents and mergers==

During this period Westinghouse continued to pour money and engineering resources into the goal of building a completely integrated AC system. To gain control of the Sawyer-Man lamp patents he bought Consolidated Electric Light in 1887. He bought the Waterhouse Electric Light Company in 1888 and the United States Illuminating Company in 1890, giving Westinghouse their own arc lighting systems as well as control over all the major incandescent lamp patents not controlled by Edison. In April 1888 Westinghouse engineer Oliver B. Shallenberger developed an induction meter that used a rotating magnetic field for measuring alternating current, giving the company a way to calculate how much electricity a customer used. In July 1888 Westinghouse paid a substantial amount to license Nikola Tesla&#x27;s US patents for a poly-phase AC induction motor and obtained a patent option on Galileo Ferraris&#x27; induction motor design. Although the acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, the general shortage of cash the company was going through by 1890 meant development had to be put on hold for a while. The difficulties of obtaining funding for such a capital intensive business was becoming a serious problem for the company and 1890 saw the first of several attempts by investor J. P. Morgan to take over Westinghouse Electric.

Thomson-Houston was continuing to expand, buying seven smaller electric companies including a purchase of the Brush Electric Company in 1889. By 1890 Thomson-Houston controlled the majority of the arc lighting systems in the US and a collection of its own US AC patents. Several of the business deals between Thomson-Houston and Westinghouse fell apart and in April 1888 a judge rolled back part of Westinghouse&#x27;s original Gaulard Gibbs patent, stating it only covered transformers linked in series.

With the help of the financier Henry Villard the Edison group of companies also went through a series of mergers: &quot;Edison Lamp Company&quot;, a lamp manufacturer in East Newark, New Jersey; &quot;Edison Machine Works&quot;, a manufacturer of dynamos and large electric motors in Schenectady, New York; &quot;Bergmann &amp; Company&quot;, a manufacturer of electric lighting fixtures, sockets, and other electric lighting devices; and &quot;Edison Electric Light Company&quot;, the patent-holding company and the financial arm backed by J.P. Morgan and the Vanderbilt family for Edison&#x27;s lighting experiments, merged. The new company, &quot;Edison General Electric Company&quot;, was formed in January 1889 with the help of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. and Grosvenor Lowrey with Villard as president. It later included the Sprague Electric Railway &amp; Motor Company.

==The peak of the war==

Through the fall of 1888 a battle of words with Brown specifically attacking Westinghouse continued to escalate. In November George Westinghouse challenged Brown&#x27;s assertion in the pages of the &quot;Electrical Engineer&quot; that the Westinghouse AC systems had caused 30 deaths. The magazine investigated the claim and found at most only two of the deaths could be attributed to Westinghouse installations.

===Associating AC and Westinghouse with the electric chair===
Although New York had a criminal procedure code that specified electrocution via an electric chair, it did not spell out the type of electricity, the amount of current, or its method of supply, since these were still relative unknowns. The New York Medico-Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of working out the details and in late 1888 through early 1889 conducted a series of animal experiments on voltage amounts, electrode design and placement, and skin conductivity. During this time they sought the advice of Harold Brown as a consultant. This ended up expanding the war of currents into the development of the chair and the general debate over capital punishment in the US.

After the Medico-Legal Society formed their committee in September 1888 chairman Frederick Peterson, who had been an assistant at Brown&#x27;s July 1888 public electrocution of dogs with AC at Columbia College, had the results of those experiments submitted to the committee. The claims that AC was more deadly than DC and was the best current to use was questioned, with some committee members pointing out that Brown&#x27;s experiments were not scientifically carried out and were on animals smaller than a human being. At their November meeting the committee recommended 3,000 volts although the type of electricity, direct current or alternating current, was not determined. 

In order to more conclusively prove to the committee that AC was more deadly than DC, Brown contacted Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings to arrange the use of the West Orange laboratory. There on December 5, 1888 Brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society, the chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC. Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society&#x27;s December meeting recommended the use of 1,000–1,500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities.

Westinghouse criticized these tests as a skewed self-serving demonstration designed to be a direct attack on alternating current. On December 13 in a letter to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Westinghouse spelled out where Brown&#x27;s experiments were wrong and claimed again that Brown was being employed by the Edison company. Brown&#x27;s December 18 letter refuted the claims and Brown even challenged Westinghouse to an electrical duel, with Brown agreeing to be shocked by ever-increasing amounts of DC power if Westinghouse submitted himself to the same amount of increasing AC power, first to quit loses. Westinghouse declined the offer.

In March 1889 when members of the Medico-Legal Society embarked on another series of tests to work out the details of electrode composition and placement they turned to Brown for technical assistance. Edison treasurer Hastings tried unsuccessfully to obtain a Westinghouse AC generator for the test. They ended up using Edison&#x27;s West Orange laboratory for the animal tests.

Also in March, Superintendent of Prisons Austin Lathrop asked Brown if he could supply the equipment needed for the executions as well as design the electric chair. Brown turned down the job of designing the chair but did agree to fulfill the contract to supply the necessary electrical equipment. The state refused to pay up front, and Brown apparently turned to Edison Electric as well as Thomson-Houston Electric Company to help obtaining the equipment. This became another behind-the-scenes maneuver to acquire Westinghouse AC generators to supply the current, apparently with the help of the Edison company and Westinghouse&#x27;s chief AC rival, Thomson-Houston. Thomson-Houston arranged to acquire three Westinghouse AC generators by replacing them with new Thomson-Houston AC generators. Thomson-Houston president Charles Coffin had at least two reasons for obtaining the Westinghouse generators; he did not want his company&#x27;s equipment to be associated with the death penalty and he wanted to use one to prove a point, paying Brown to set up a public efficiency test to show that Westinghouse&#x27;s sales claim of manufacturing 50% more efficient generators was false.

That spring Brown published &quot;The Comparative Danger to Life of the Alternating and Continuous Electrical Current&quot; detailing the animal experiments done at Edison&#x27;s lab and claiming they showed AC was far deadlier than DC. This 61-page professionally printed booklet (possibly paid for by the Edison company) was sent to government officials, newspapers, and businessmen in towns with populations greater than 5,000 inhabitants.

In May 1889 when New York had its first criminal sentenced to be executed in the electric chair, a street merchant named William Kemmler, there was a great deal of discussion in the editorial column of the &quot;New York Times&quot; as to what to call the then-new form of execution. The term &quot;&quot;Westinghouse&quot;d&quot; was put forward as well as &quot;&quot;Gerry&quot;cide&quot; (after death penalty commission head Elbridge Gerry), and &quot;&quot;Brown&quot;ed&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; hated the word that was eventually adopted, electrocution, describing it as being pushed forward by &quot;pretentious ignoramuses&quot;. One of Edison&#x27;s lawyers wrote to his colleague expressing an opinion that Edison&#x27;s preference for &quot;dynamort&quot;, &quot;ampermort&quot; and &quot;electromort&quot; were not good terms but thought &quot;Westinghouse&quot;d was the best choice.&quot;&quot;

====The Kemmler appeal====

William Kemmler was sentenced to die in the electric chair around June 24, 1889, but before the sentence could be carried out an appeal was filed on the grounds that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution. It became obvious to the press and everyone involved that the politically connected (and expensive) lawyer who filed the appeal, William Bourke Cockran, had no connection to the case but did have connection to the Westinghouse company, obviously paying for his services.

During fact-finding hearings held around the state beginning on July 9 in New York City, Cockran used his considerable skills as a cross-examiner and orator to attack Brown, Edison, and their supporters. His strategy was to show that Brown had falsified his test on the killing power of AC and to prove that electricity would not cause certain death and simply lead to torturing the condemned. In cross examination he questioned Brown&#x27;s lack of credentials in the electrical field and brought up possible collusion between Brown and Edison, which Brown again denied. Many witnesses were called by both sides to give firsthand anecdotal accounts about encounters with electricity and evidence was given by medical professionals on the human body&#x27;s nervous system and the electrical conductivity of skin. Brown was accused of fudging his tests on animals, hiding the fact that he was using lower current DC and high-current AC. When the hearing convened for a day at Edison&#x27;s West Orange lab to witness demonstrations of skin resistance to electricity, Brown almost got in a fight with a Westinghouse representative, accusing him of being in the Edison laboratory to conduct industrial espionage. Newspapers noted the often contradictory testimony was raising public doubts about the electrocution law but after Edison took the stand many accepted assurances from the &quot;wizard of Menlo Park&quot; that 1,000 volts of AC would easily kill any man.

After the gathered testimony was submitted and the two sides presented their case, Judge Edwin Day ruled against Kemmler&#x27;s appeal on October 9 and US Supreme Court denied Kemmler&#x27;s appeal on May 23, 1890.

When the chair was first used, on August 6, 1890, the technicians on hand misjudged the voltage needed to kill William Kemmler. After the first jolt of electricity Kemmler was found to be still breathing. The procedure had to be repeated and a reporter on hand described it as &quot;an awful spectacle, far worse than hanging.&quot; George Westinghouse commented: &quot;They would have done better using an axe.&quot;

===Brown&#x27;s collusion exposed===
On August 25, 1889 the New York Sun ran a story headlined:
The story was based on 45 letters stolen from Brown&#x27;s office that spelled out Brown&#x27;s collusion with Thomson-Houston and Edison Electric. The majority of the letters were correspondence between Brown and Thomson-Houston on the topic of acquiring the three Westinghouse generators for the state of New York as well as using one of them in an efficiency test. They also showed that Brown had received $5,000 from Edison Electric to purchase the surplus Westinghouse generators from Thomson-Houston. Further Edison involvement was contained in letters from Edison treasurer Hastings asking Brown to send anti-AC pamphlets to all the legislators in the state of Missouri (at the company&#x27;s expense), Brown requesting that a letter of recommendation from Thomas Edison be sent to Scranton, Pennsylvania, as well as Edison and Arthur Kennelly coaching Brown in his upcoming testimony in the Kemmler appeal trial.

Brown was not slowed down by this revelation and characterized his efforts to expose Westinghouse as the same as going after a grocer who sells poison and calls it sugar.

===The &quot;Electric Wire Panic&quot;===
1889 saw another round of deaths attributed to alternating current including a lineman in Buffalo, New York, four linemen in New York City, and a New York fruit merchant who was killed when the display he was using came in contact with an overhead line. NYC Mayor Hugh J. Grant, in a meeting with the Board of Electrical Control and the AC electric companies, rejected the claims that the AC lines were perfectly safe saying &quot;we get news of all who touch them through the coroners office&quot;. On October 11, 1889, John Feeks, a Western Union lineman, was high up in the tangle of overhead electrical wires working on what were supposed to be low-voltage telegraph lines in a busy Manhattan district. As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high-voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering for the better part of an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below. The source of the power that killed Feeks was not determined although United States Illuminating Company lines ran nearby.

Feeks&#x27; public death sparked a new round of people fearing the electric lines over their heads in what has been called the &quot;Electric Wire Panic&quot;. The blame seemed to settle on Westinghouse since, Westinghouse having bought many of the lighting companies involved, people assumed Feeks&#x27; death was the fault of a Westinghouse subsidiary. Newspapers joined into the public outcry following Feeks&#x27; death, pointing out men&#x27;s lives &quot;were cheaper to this monopoly than insulated wires&quot; and calling for the executives of AC companies to be charged with manslaughter. The October 13, 1889, New Orleans &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; noted &quot;Death does not stop at the door, but comes right into the house, and perhaps as you are closing a door or turning on the gas you are killed.&quot; Harold Brown&#x27;s reputation was rehabilitated almost overnight with newspapers and magazines seeking his opinion and reporters following him around New York City where he measured how much current was leaking from AC power lines.
At the peak of the war of currents, Edison himself joined the public debate for the first time, denounced AC current in a November 1889 article in the &quot;North American Review&quot; titled &quot;The Dangers of Electric Lighting&quot;. Edison put forward the view that burying the high-voltage lines was not a solution, and would simply move the deaths underground and be a &quot;constant menace&quot; that could short with other lines threatening people&#x27;s homes and lives. He stated the only way to make AC safe was to limit its voltage and vowed Edison Electric would never adopt AC as long as he was in charge.

George Westinghouse was characterized as a villain trying to defend pole-mounted AC installations that he knew were unsafe, and fumbled his replies to the questions put to him by reporters, attempting to point out all the other things in a large city that were more dangerous than AC. However, his subsequent response, printed in the &quot;North American Review&quot;, was much improved, highlighting that his AC/transformer system actually used lower household voltages than the Edison DC system. He also pointed out 87 deaths in one year caused by street cars and gas lighting, versus only 5 accidental electrocutions and no in-home deaths attributed to AC current.

The crowd that watched Feeks contained many New York aldermen due to the site of the accident being near the New York government offices and the horrifying affair galvanized them into the action of passing the law on moving utilities underground. The electric companies involved obtained an injunction preventing their lines from being cut down immediately but shut down most of their lighting until the situation was settled, plunging many New York streets into darkness. The legislation ordering the cutting down of all of the utility lines was finally upheld by the New York Supreme Court in December. The AC lines were cut down, keeping many New York City streets in darkness for the rest of the winter, since little had been done by the overpaid Tammany Hall city supervisors who were supposed arrange the building of the underground &quot;subways&quot; to house them.

==The current war ends==
Even with the Westinghouse propaganda losses, the war of currents itself was winding down with direct current on the losing side. This was due in part to Thomas Edison himself leaving the electric power business. Edison was becoming marginalized in his own company, having lost majority control in the 1889 merger that formed Edison General Electric. In 1890, he told president Henry Villard he thought it was time to retire from the lighting business and moved on to an iron ore refining project that preoccupied his time. Edison&#x27;s dogmatic anti-AC values were no longer controlling the company. By 1889, Edison&#x27;s Electric&#x27;s own subsidiaries were lobbying to add AC power transmission to their systems, and in October 1890, Edison Machine Works began developing AC-based equipment.

With Thomas Edison no longer involved with Edison General Electric, the war of currents came to a close with a financial merger. Edison president Henry Villard, who had engineered the merger that formed Edison General Electric, was continually working on the idea of merging that company with Thomson-Houston or Westinghouse. He saw a real opportunity in 1891. The market was in a general downturn causing cash shortages for all the companies concerned and Villard was in talks with Thomson-Houston, which was now Edison General Electric&#x27;s biggest competitor. Thomson-Houston had a habit of saving money on development by buying, or sometimes stealing, patents. Patent conflicts were stymieing the growth of both companies and the idea of saving on some 60 ongoing lawsuits as well as saving on profit losses of trying to undercut each other by selling generating plants below cost pushed forward the idea of this merger in financial circles. Edison hated the idea and tried to hold it off, but Villard thought his company, now winning its incandescent light patent lawsuits in the courts, was in a position to dictate the terms of any merger. As a committee of financiers, which included J.P. Morgan, worked on the deal in early 1892, things went against Villard. In Morgan&#x27;s view, Thomson-Houston looked on the books to be the stronger of the two companies and engineered a behind the scenes deal announced on April 15, 1892, that put the management of Thomson-Houston in control of the new company, now called General Electric (dropping Edison&#x27;s name). Thomas Edison was not aware of the deal until the day before it happened.

The fifteen electric companies that existed five years before had merged down to two: General Electric and Westinghouse. The war of currents came to an end, and this merger of the Edison company, along with its lighting patents, and the Thomson-Houston, with its AC patents, created a company that controlled three quarters of the US electrical business. From this point on, General Electric and Westinghouse were both marketing alternating current systems. Edison put on a brave face, noting to the media how his stock had gained value in the deal, but privately he was bitter that his company and all of his patents had been turned over to the competition.

===Aftermath===
Even though the institutional war of currents had ended in a financial merger, the technical difference between direct and alternating current systems followed a much longer technical merger. Due to innovation in the US and Europe, alternating current&#x27;s economy of scale with very large generating plants linked to loads via long-distance transmission was slowly being combined with the ability to link it up with all of the existing systems that needed to be supplied. These included single phase AC systems, poly-phase AC systems, low-voltage incandescent lighting, high voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars. In the engineered &quot;universal system&quot; these technological differences were temporarily being bridged via the development of rotary converters and motor–generators that allowed the large number of legacy systems to be connected to the AC grid. These stopgaps were slowly replaced as older systems were retired or upgraded.

In May 1892, Westinghouse Electric managed to underbid General Electric on the contract to electrify the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and, although they made no profit, their demonstration of a safe, effective and highly flexible universal alternating current system powering all of the disparate electrical systems at the Exposition led to them winning the bid at the end of that year to build an AC power station at Niagara Falls. General Electric was awarded contracts to build AC transmission lines and transformers in that project and further bids at Niagara were split with GE who were quickly catching up in the AC field due partly to Charles Proteus Steinmetz, a Prussian mathematician who was the first person to fully understand AC power from a solid mathematical standpoint. General Electric hired many talented new engineers to improve its design of transformers, generators, motors and other apparatus.

A three-phase three-wire transmission system had already been deployed in Europe at the International Electro-Technical Exhibition of 1891, where Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky used this system to transmit electric power over a distance of 176 km with 75% efficiency. In 1891 he also created a three-phase transformer, the short-circuited (squirrel-cage) induction motor and designed the world&#x27;s first three-phase hydroelectric power plant.

Patent lawsuits were still hampering both companies and bleeding off cash, so in 1896, J. P. Morgan engineered a patent sharing agreement between the two companies that remained in force for 11 years.

In 1897 Edison sold his remaining stock in Edison Electric Illuminating of New York to finance his iron ore refining prototype plant. In 1908, Edison said to George Stanley, son of AC transformer inventor William Stanley, Jr., &quot;Tell your father I was wrong&quot;, likely an admission that he had underestimated the developmental potential of alternating current.

===Remnant and existent DC systems===
Some cities continued to use DC well into the 20th century. For example, central Helsinki had a DC network until the late 1940s, and Stockholm lost its dwindling DC network as late as the 1970s. A mercury-arc valve rectifier station could convert AC to DC where networks were still used. Parts of Boston, Massachusetts, along Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue still used 110 volts DC in the 1960s, causing the destruction of many small appliances (typically hair dryers and phonographs) used by Boston University students, who ignored warnings about the electricity supply. 

New York City&#x27;s electric utility company, Consolidated Edison, continued to supply direct current to customers who had adopted it early in the twentieth century, mainly for elevators. The New Yorker Hotel, constructed in 1929, had a large direct-current power plant and did not convert fully to alternating-current service until well into the 1960s. This was the building in which AC pioneer Nikola Tesla spent his last years, and where he died in 1943. New York City&#x27;s Broadway theaters continued to use DC services until 1975, requiring the use of outmoded manual resistance dimmer boards operated by several stagehands. This practice ended when the musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; introduced computerized lighting control and thyristor (SCR) dimmers to Broadway, and New York theaters were finally converted to AC.

In January 1998, Consolidated Edison started to eliminate DC service. At that time there were 4,600 DC customers. By 2006, there were only 60 customers using DC service, and on November 14, 2007, the last direct-current distribution by Con Edison was shut down. Customers still using DC were provided with on-site AC to DC rectifiers. In 2012, Pacific Gas and Electric Company still provided DC power to some locations in San Francisco, primarily for elevators, supplied by close to 200 rectifiers each providing power for 7–10 customers.

The Central Electricity Generating Board in the UK maintained a 200–volt DC generating station at Bankside Power Station in London until 1981. It exclusively powered DC printing machinery in Fleet Street, then the heart of the UK&#x27;s newspaper industry. It was decommissioned later in 1981 when the newspaper industry moved into the developing docklands area further down the river (using modern AC-powered equipment).

High-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems are used for bulk transmission of energy from distant generating stations, for underwater lines, and for interconnection of separate alternating-current systems.

<text>Plitvice Lakes National Park (, colloquially &quot;Plitvice&quot;, ) is one of the oldest and largest national parks in Croatia. In 1979, Plitvice Lakes National Park was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, for its outstanding and picturesque series of tufa lakes, caves, and connected waterfalls.


The national park was founded in 1949 and is in the mountainous karst area of central Croatia, at the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The important north–south road that passes through the national park area connects the Croatian inland with the Adriatic coastal region.

The protected area extends over . About 90% of this area is part of Lika-Senj County, while the remaining 10% is part of Karlovac County.

Each year, more than 1 million visitors are recorded, making the national park the most popular tourist attraction in Croatia. Entrance is subject to variable charges, between 10 and 40 € per adult per day in summer ().

== Area ==
The national park is world-famous for its lakes arranged in cascades. Sixteen lakes can be seen from the surface. These lakes are a result of the confluence of several small rivers and subterranean karst rivers. The lakes are all interconnected and follow the water flow. They are separated by natural dams of travertine, which is deposited by the action of moss, algae, and bacteria. The particularly sensitive travertine barriers are the result of an interplay between water, air and plants. The encrusted plants and bacteria accumulate on top of each other, forming travertine barriers which grow at the rate of about per year.

The 16 lakes are separated into an upper and lower cluster formed by runoff from the mountains, descending from an altitude of over a distance of some , aligned in a south–north direction. The lakes collectively cover an area of about , the water exiting from the lowest lake forming the Korana River.

The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colors, ranging from azure to green, grey or blue. The colors change constantly depending on the quantity of minerals or organisms in the water and the angle of sunlight.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Plitvice&quot; was first mentioned in a written document in 1777 by Dominik Vukasović, the priest of Otočac. This name was designated because of natural phenomena that have created the lakes. Nature formed shallow basins (Croatian &quot;pličina&quot; or &quot;plitvak&quot;, &quot;plitko&quot; means &quot;shallow&quot;), which have been filled with water. For centuries, water has changed the limestone and thus the landscape of this area. The emerging travertine barriers decelerated and retained the flowing water. These dams are continuously growing in height.

Some scientists refer to the river Plitvica as origin of the name. This little river flows into the Plitvice Lakes at the lower and final part of the lakes. A nearby village bears the same name. The water masses of the Plitvice Lakes continue as Korana river in northern direction.

== Location ==

=== Routes and distances ===
The Plitvice Lakes have formed in a depression between the Mala Kapela mountain in the west and the Lička Plješivica mountain in the east amidst the Dinaric Alps. The national park is located at the national route D1 Zagreb–Split between Slunj and Korenica in the vicinity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other larger municipalities within the surrounding area are Ogulin, Rakovica, Otočac, Gospić and Bihać in Bosnia.

The shortest linear distance between the Adriatic coast and the national park is . By road from the coastal town of Senj the distance is about . After traversing the Velebit mountain range travelers reach the Croatian karst plains of Lika. These plains are characterized by many karst poljes (e.g. the Gacko polje).

The fastest north–south road connection within Croatia, the A1 Zagreb–Split, runs about west of the national park and thus circumvents the protected area. Plitvice Lakes National Park can be reached from &quot;Karlovac exit&quot; in the north, from &quot;Otočac exit&quot; in the west or &quot;Gornja Ploča exit&quot; in the south.

The nearest airports are Zadar, Zagreb and Rijeka. The nearest train stations are Josipdol and Plaški, although no direct bus connection from these train stations to the lakes exists. Using public transport the lakes can easily be reached by direct bus lines from Zagreb, Karlovac, Zadar or Split.

The area of Plitvice Lakes National Park extends across two political subdivisions or counties (Croatian &quot;županija&quot;). Its area is divided between Lika-Senj County (90.7 percent) and Karlovac County (9.3 percent), hence the national park authority is under national jurisdiction. The overall water body area is about . The two largest lakes, Prošćansko jezero and Kozjak, cover about 80 percent of the overall water body area. These lakes are also the deepest, with a depth of respectively. On Lake Kozjak, low-noise and ecologically friendly electric boats are being used. None of the other lakes in the park exceeds in depth. The altitude drop from the first lake to the last is .

The sixteen lakes that can be seen from the surface are grouped into the twelve Upper Lakes (&quot;Gornja jezera&quot;) and the four Lower Lakes (&quot;Donja jezera&quot;).

The highest waterfalls are the Large Waterfall (Croatian &quot;Veliki slap&quot;) at the end of the Lower Lakes, over which the Plitvica river falls, and &quot;Veliki Prštavac&quot; at the Upper Lakes.

Within the national park area there are 19 small settlements. Altogether they form the Plitvice Lakes municipality (Croatian &quot;općina Plitvička Jezera&quot;). The municipality is part of Lika-Senj County. The seat is located in Korenica.

The Plitvice Lakes area has always been regarded as part of the historic regions of Lika and Kordun. During the Ottoman Wars, the region was part of the Croatian Military Frontier that was under direct control of the Habsburg Council of War.

== Topography and geology ==

=== Terrain ===

The particular geographic position of the Plitvice Lakes and the specific climate features contributed to the emergence of many natural phenomena and a rich biodiversity within this area. Despite the vicinity of the Mediterranean climatic region, a moderate mountainous climate prevails at the Plitvice Lakes due to the Velebit mountain range, which acts as a climatic separator between the coastal region and the Lika high plateau. For centuries, legends have been created about this mythic mountain range.

The availability of water, influenced by the configuration of the terrain, has a great impact on the biodiversity of this area. The Plitvice Lakes are surrounded by various mountains. The western side of the national park area is enclosed by the Mala Kapela mountain, while the eastern side is enclosed by the Lička Plješivica mountain, which also represents the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Plitvice Lakes National Park is situated in the Plitvice plateau which is surrounded by three mountains that are part of the Dinaric Alps: Lička Plješivica mountain (Gola Plješevica peak 1,640 m), Mala Kapela mountain (Seliški Vrh peak at 1,280 m), and Medveđak (884 m).

The afforested mountain slopes serve as water reservoirs. They are also a refuge for many animal species. The large difference in altitude in a narrow space between the mountains in the south and the Korana river in the north represents a significant criterion for biodiversity in this region. The overall difference in altitude within the national park area is 912 m (the highest elevation is &quot;Seliški vrh&quot; at 1279 m, the lowest elevation is reached at 367 m at the bridge across the Korana river).

The national Park is underlain by karstic rock, mainly dolomite and limestone with associated lakes and caves, this has given rise to the most distinctive feature of the lakes. Right at the lakes, the &quot;Golubnjača Cave&quot; (145 m) before the second Korana waterfall and &quot;Šupljara Cave&quot; (68 m) above Lake Kaluđerovac can be visited. Other caves are &quot;Mračna Cave&quot; (160 m), &quot;Vila Jezerkinje Cave&quot; (104 m) and &quot;Golubnjača at Homoljačko Field&quot; (153 m). Within the national park, several pit-caves exist, such as the &quot;Čudinka&quot; pit-cave (-203 m) or &quot;Jama&quot; on Vršić (-154 m, length 110 m). In &quot;Rodića Cave&quot; at Sertić Poljana and in &quot;Mračna Cave&quot; at the Lower Lakes, cave bear bones were found, so these sites may be considered paleontologically significant.

=== Rivers ===

The Plitvice Lakes originate in the south of the park area at the confluence of &quot;Bijela Rijeka&quot; (&quot;White River&#x27;&quot;) and &quot;Crna Rijeka&quot; (&quot;Black River&quot;). These rivers originate south of the municipality of Plitvički Ljeskovac and unite at one of the bridges in this village. From this place onwards to the lakes, the water masses are referred to as &quot;Matica&quot; (English for &quot;water current&quot;, can also mean &quot;root&quot; or &quot;origin&quot;). At the bay of &quot;Liman&quot; (also called &quot;Limun&quot;), a part of &quot;Prošćansko jezero&quot;, another small river flows into the lakes. This river is fed by permanent springs; the water quantity, however, varies. Temporarily, water from other, usually dry, creeks reaches &quot;Prošćansko jezero&quot; from the west.

The river Plitvica reaches the Plitvice lake chain at the northern end via the &quot;Large Waterfall&quot;. This place is called &quot;Sastavci&quot; (English &quot;confluence&quot; or &quot;composition&quot;). The waterbodies of the Plitvice Lakes and the River Plitvice form the Korana river.

=== Properties of the underground ===
The underground configuration of the Plitvice Lakes consists of various geologic features. Generally, the whole area of Plitvice Lakes National Park can be attributed to the South-East European karst area. The typical feature of this karst area is brittle or porous rock, mostly limestone or dolomite. This configuration creates different geomorphological phenomena being referred to as dolina (sinkhole), polje, uvala, ponor, etc.

In the future, the analysis of underground water courses could be an interesting field of research for speleologists. Up to now, little has been known about these unexplored courses. At first sight, a lack of water in the karst region could be ascertained. However, this is only the case on the surface. The major part of natural phenomena takes place underground, where an abundance of water exists.

Because limestone is soluble, many rivers drain away into the rock, forming extensive underground river systems. Upon reaching hard rock, rivers emerge on the surface. This phenomenon of underground karst rivers (Croatian &quot;rijeka ponornica&quot;) can also be observed at the Plitvice Lakes.

Tufa sediments have been formed from the Pleistocene onwards in sinkholes or depressed areas between the surrounding mountains. Generally seen, the underground of the Plitvice Lakes could be categorized into two zones. The Upper Lakes in the south predominantly consist of dolomite rock. The Lower lakes in the north predominantly consist of limestone rock. Dolomite rock is slightly harder than limestone. Though fragile upon physical influence, dolomite rock has lower water permeability properties. In contrast, limestone rock is more compact and massive, but has a higher water permeability.

From an aerial perspective, significant differences between the terrain of the Upper and the Lower Plitvice Lakes can be observed. At the Upper Lakes several little lakes have formed parallel to each other and a rather shallow water flow can be observed. The Lower Lakes, however, are much larger and virtually drill their path through the rock. Furthermore, there are only a few lakes at the Lower Lakes. They have formed a canyon, which continues as river Korana.

== Climate ==

On average, the annual precipitation rate at the Plitvice Lakes is . Usually, in spring and fall (autumn) the largest rain quantities are measured. The average relative air humidity is 81.8 percent. In January, the average temperature is 2.2 °C (36 °F). During the summer months of July and August, the temperature rises to 17.4 °C (63 °F). The general average annual temperature is 7.9 °C (46 °F). Snow falls from November until March. Usually, the lakes are frozen during December and January.

The water temperature at the springs is usually below 10 °C (50 °F). Within the rivers and lakes, the water temperature rises up to 20 °C (68 °F). The following example for different water temperatures measured on July 7, 1954 demonstrates large temperature differences within the lakes: at lake Kozjak the depth of 4 m a temperature of 18.9 °C (66 °F) has been measured. At a depth of 20 m, 5 °C (41 °F) have been measured. At 44 m depth, virtually at the bottom of the lake, a temperature of 4.1 °C (39 °F) has been measured.

== The dissolution and creation of rock ==
The lakes of Plitvice are a result of century-old processes and the sedimentation of chalk, which is abundantly available in the waters of this karst area. These sedimentations are called tufa or travertine (both are called &quot;sedra&quot; or &quot;tuf&quot; in Croatian, apart from many other names like &quot;bigar&quot; or &quot;vapneni mačak&quot;).

A distinctive feature of the Plitvice lakes is the fact that they do not represent separated, stationary waters. The lakes have always been seen as one composed system of lakes. Because of constant changes it is not possible to analyse individual lakes. The water masses reaching the lakes at the upper or lower part of the system are continuously changing the outlook of the lakes and the surrounding landscape. They finally exit the lakes as river Korana. On the one hand, chalk tufa is being washed away partly. On the other hand, new sediments are continuously being formed. Thus, new waterfalls are being formed while others run dry. Nature itself is continuously adapting to these new conditions. As a whole, the complex of lakes represents a very sensitive and labile (liable to change) ecosystem.

=== Alteration processes ===

In geological terms, the actual phenomena molding the Plitvice Lakes are quite young. The complex processes of dissolution and sedimentation of limestone require specific climatic preconditions. These have only existed since the end of the ice age about 12,000 to 15,000 years ago, according to tufa radiocarbon datings.

Apart from weather and temperature factors, the water quality and other natural factors are significant for the creation of these natural phenomena, prevailing at the Plitvice Lakes. By passing through the limestone underground the karst rivers dissolve chalk (calcite), which concentrates in the water. The saturation level of calcite within the frontal flows is thus very high. The water becomes significantly mineralized, super-saturated with calcium and magnesium-hydrogencarbonate.

The dissolution of limestone happens through alteration processes and the effects of carbonic acid. In a natural environment, carbonic acid (H2CO3) is formed by the dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air or from rainwater (H2O). Limestone or dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) mainly consists of calcite (CaCO3), which is not very soluble in water. Calcite, however, is dissolved by carbonic acid, thus creating calcium hydrogencarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2). This is shown by the following formulas:

The quantity of calcium hydrogencarbonate (calcium bicarbonate) dissolved in water depends on the quantity of dissolved carbon dioxide in the water. Generally, the following could be said: The colder the water, the higher the quantity of dissolved calcium hydrogencarbonate. Depending on the conditions for the alteration processes, scientists identified limestone dissolution rates of 0.01 to 4 millimeters a year (it is possible that by the effect of rainwater about 1 m3 of limestone is dissolved in about 10,000 years).

=== Sedimentation processes ===

The previously mentioned mechanical and chemical dissolution processes are regularly occurring natural phenomena. A unique process occurring at the Plitvice Lakes, however, is the sedimentation of water-bound chalk at certain places. With regard to other similar phenomena in the world, at Plitvice Lakes the sedimentation of chalk and the formation of tufa happens dynamically all along the watercourse and in various forms (fluviatile sedimentation). It is thus not a static phenomenon occurring at only single places.

Another unique and distinctive feature are the natural factors, particularly the influences of the vegetation in the process of sedimentation. While passing the vegetation, barriers are being created by foaming water. These naturally created barriers decelerate and dam the waters, thus forming lakes. At Plitvice, this constant interplay between water, air, rock and vegetation can easily be observed. The foaming water creates ever growing and impressive waterfalls. The thresholds grown up above the water level, create cataracts.

About north of the lakes at the conflux of the Korana and Slunjčica rivers, right in the center of the town of Slunj, similar phenomena occur. This part of the town, called Rastoke, is often being referred to as &quot;the Small Lakes of Plitvice.&quot;

==== Preconditions for sedimentation ====

Measurements of carbon dioxide quantities in the water show that they correspond with continuous sedimentation processes in the Plitvice Lakes area. Carbon dioxide quantities at the springs are about twenty times higher than in the atmosphere. The quantity of carbon dioxide decreases along the water route. The Plitvica river, for example, loses even up to 97% of its original quantity of carbon dioxide along its route.

The sedimentation of calcium carbonate from the water occurs only above 14 °C when the water warms up or by evaporation or by another loss of carbon dioxide, additionally fostered by water plants and moss. Since sedimentation only occurs under warm, humid climate conditions, these phenomena have only been occurring since the end of the last ice age. Since then, a layer of hardened tufa, also called travertine, has been formed on the limestone ground.

The area of a river, in which the formation of tufa occurs, is called precipitation area. Along the Korana river, for example, measured from its origins, tufa is being formed only along the first 10 to , even if according to pH measurements the conditions would be favorable further down the river. At the ground of Lake Kozjak a constant yearly sedimentation of 0,8 millimeters during the past 3,000 years has been ascertained. Yearly, the barriers are growing up to 13 millimeters in height. Tufa formation processes thus surpass erosion activities, which would destroy the sensitive barriers of the lakes. It is estimated that the tufa sedimentations at the ground of the lakes date back 6,000 or even 7,000 years.

The precipitation of calcium carbonate, however, does not occur right at the springs of the rivers that flow into the Plitvice Lakes. For the precipitation of carbonate chalk (calcium carbonate) the water needs to reach a certain mineral saturation level. At the springs this saturation level is about 1. For the precipitation, the water saturation level needs to be higher than 3. At the same time, the pH value of the water needs to be above 8,0 (slightly alkaline).

==== Thresholds become barriers ====


Tufa barriers are the result of continuous sedimentation processes along natural thresholds. As the water flows in thin layers over thresholds, it is splashed up. This disturbs the chemical balance and causes precipitation of the carbonates, which then creates sedimentary deposits. Since the water forms larger surfaces at these places, increased quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) are released. Calcium carbonate is secreted in the form of microcrystals that are deposited, eventually creating tufa sediments (CaCO3). This phenomenon particularly occurs on abundantly available mosses, enabling better adherence of the crystals.

In the course of time, older barriers can be flooded by rising water levels since other barriers have outgrown the older ones. 400 years ago, there were two lakes in place of today&#x27;s Kozjak lake. In the lowest third of the lake, at the level of &quot;Matijaševića draga&quot;, a crown of an underwater barrier that is 40 m high, is stretching 4 m below the water surface. This barrier certainly formed a magnificent waterfall in the past. The travertine barrier at the Kozjak bridges at the current end of the Kozjak lake, however, grew faster. Thus, 400 years ago two lakes merged in one. That is why the greatest depths of Kozjak lake are in its lower basin (north from the little island).

==== Influence of vegetation ====

Mosses, algae and water plants play a major role in forming the unique landscape of the Plitvice Lakes and its tufa barriers. Up until the 21st century, it was supposed that plants extract carbon dioxide from the water for photosynthesis purposes and that in return oxygen is released, thus resulting in the sedimentation of hydrogen carbonate (phytogenesis). The leading scientist arguing for this theory was Ivo Pevalek whose efforts contributed to the national protection of the lakes.

Recent scientific evidence indicates that vegetation is not primarily responsible for the extraction of carbonate from the flowing water. However, plants indirectly contribute to tufa formation. For sedimentation to occur it is essential that the water be decelerated, aerated and sprayed. The mosses of the Plitvice Lakes waterfalls provide a substrate for sedimentation, generating travertine (tufa). Depending on the species found locally, various biological types of travertine can be differentiated.

Photosynthesis by algae and mosses, however, fosters the crystallization of sediments because of the extraction of carbon dioxide. These effects are fostered by the millions of microscopically-small bacteria and algae that grow on such plants, which secrete mucus to which the first microcrystals of calcite adhere. The most significant plants of this kind are mosses of the species bryum and cratoneuron.

The young shoots of mosses are green and soft. They are mostly without travertine, while older shoots are encrusted by a thin and fragile yellow layer, completely covered and petrified by plant-formed travertine. The mosses foster not only the creation of tufa barriers, but also become part of the barrier. The moss becomes encrusted with travertine and fresh moss grows further out. First a crag is formed but later a cave roof forms under the crag. If the water continues flowing, the cave becomes progressively bigger. Older travertine is filled with fossilized algae and mosses. This type of tufa rock typical of the Plitvice Lakes is called &quot;phytogeneous tufa.&quot;

==== Factors impeding tufa formation ====
Even though the vegetation has beneficial effects for the formation of tufa, excessive concentrations of organic substances within the water impede its formation. Excessive plant cover has adverse effects on mineral sedimentation. Along the course of Korana River from the Korana bridge, for example, travertine creation ends quite quickly, in spite of its supersaturation with calcium bicarbonate, as a result of the increased concentration of organic matter in the water. The park authorities have therefore begun systematic removal of excessive vegetation along the barriers. Water purity is the decisive factor for tufa formation. The water at the influx to the Plitvice Lakes is defined as pure from an analytical point of view. The Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) value of the water barely exceeds 2.5 mg/L at the influx to the Upper Lakes (Matica). At the Lower Lakes higher concentrations are measured (5.15 mg/L). At the springs of other Croatian rivers in the karst region similar concentrations have been recorded.

During the 20th century, uncontrolled tourism and water pollution caused by waste water from hotels and agricultural activities in the surrounding area have led to damage. This has led to increasing eutrophication of the lakes (increased concentrations of organic substances within the water). For the sustainable formation of tufa it is therefore imperative to protect this extremely sensitive area from excessively harmful human influence. Since 2006, it has been strictly forbidden to bathe or swim in the lakes. Previously, swimming had been allowed in Lake Kozjak.

==== Types of rock ====
== Flora and fauna ==
The area of the Plitvice Lakes is one of the most significant areas of Croatia for plant and animal diversity, mainly because of climatic conditions and its relatively remote location. The low level of industrial development in the surrounding area, along with the early introduction of protective measures, means an almost untouched landscape has been preserved. The partially primeval beech and fir forests host species such as the brown bear.

The Plitvice Lakes national park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation. It has a notably wide variety of plant communities, because of its range of microclimates, differing soils and varying levels of altitude.
Scientists have so far identified 1,267 different types of plants belonging to the 109 species so far recorded in the area of the national park. 75 species of plants are endemic, which means that they were first defined and classified in this area of the world or nearby. A great number of these plants and species are protected by law. Within the national park area 55 different species of orchids can be found.

&quot;Examples of endemic plants found in the national park:&quot;
&quot;Examples of other rare plants:&quot;

The great plant diversity creates an interesting interplay of colours that change with the seasons. The national park has an area of 29,842 hectares, of which some 22,308 hectares consists of forests (74.75 percent), 6,957 hectares are meadows (23.31 percent) (mainly in village areas), and 217 hectares (0.72 percent) are water areas. A unique area is the forest of &quot;Čorkova uvala&quot;, a 79.50 ha virgin forest in the northwestern part of the park. Some of the beech and fir trees in this area of the park are up to 700 years old.

=== Fauna ===

The area of the national park is home to a wide variety of animal and bird species. Fauna such as the European brown bear, grey wolf, eagle owl, Eurasian lynx, European wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with commoner species.

The fauna of the Plitvice Lakes includes some 50 species of mammals. Scientists have so far discovered 321 different species of lepidoptera, of which 76 are day-flying butterflies, and 245 are nocturnal moths. However, they estimate that only about 40 percent of the lepidopteran population has been identified. Twelve amphibian and several reptile species have been recorded, including the viviparous lizard (&quot;Lacerta vivipara&quot;), the european green lizard (&quot;Lacerta viridis&quot;), the dice snake (&quot;Natrix tessellata&quot;), Vipera berus, Vipera ammodytes and the european pond turtle (&quot;Emys orbicularis&quot;).

Plitvice Lakes rank third among the Croatian national parks for avian diversity. Some 157 species have been counted, of which 70 have been recorded as breeding there. Recent findings list about 20 species of bat in the area, among them rare species in the genus &quot;Plecotus&quot;.

Brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta fario&quot; and &quot;Salmo trutta lacustris&quot;) are indigenous subspecies of fish found in the lakes. &quot;S. t. fario&quot; is found mostly in the Upper Lakes, while &quot;S. t. lacustris&quot; is mainly found in Lake Kozjak. These species developed in different life conditions independently from each other within the various lakes.

Because of the growth of vegetation at the barriers, allochthonous fish species (species that originate elsewhere and do not belong to this ecosystem) spread quickly and thus endanger autochthonous trout species. Apart from trout, common minnows (&quot;Phoxinus phoxinus&quot;) are also found. As a result of human interference the species &quot;Salvelinus alpinus&quot; and the North American rainbow trout have been introduced to this ecosystem. The European chub (&quot;Squalius cephalus&quot;) and common rudd (&quot;Scardinius erythropthalmus&quot;), whose emergence may be attributed to climate change, have also been discovered. The number of crayfish, which were almost extinct, is now again increasing. Rare olms (&quot;Proteus anguinus&quot;) can be found in the karst caves of this region.

== History ==

While other nature protection areas are located far away from any interference by man, the Plitvice Lakes have permanently been exposed to human influence in the course of history. The Plitvice Lakes do not represent an abandoned or lonely nature reserve. They are located along an important transport route and have always been a meeting place of occidental and oriental cultural influences.

=== Early history and medieval age ===
Humans have inhabited the Plitvice Lakes area for thousands of years. It has been settled in turn by Illyrians, Japods, Celts, Romans, Avars, Slavs, Croats and Turks. Under Julius Caesar the region was incorporated as the province of Illyricum into the Roman Empire. The areas of the neighborly tribes of the Pannonians, the Liburnians and Dalmatians were united into the province of Dalmatia. Successively, the Ostrogoths took over the rule. After the Battle of Nedao in 454, the Ostrogoths were rewarded with a federation agreement with the Roman Empire.

During the 6th century, Avars settled in this region, which were accompanied by the Croats. The Croats eventually defied Avar control and settled permanently in this region. In medieval times, frequent attacks by Mongols posed a permanent threat to the settled population. The lakes formed part of the medieval kingdom of Croatia which in 1102 elected to be in personal union with Hungary.

Croat rule and particularly the rule of the noble families Zrinski and Frankopan led to economic recovery in the wider area. On the remnants of an ancient settlement of the Japods and Romans a monastery was built at the lakes. Presumably, this monastery belonged to the Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit (Croatian &quot;pavlinci&quot;) or the Knights Templars. Today, only ancient wall remnants of this building (Croatian &quot;gradina&quot;) exist. The foundation was made of travertine rock.

=== Ottoman Wars and the Habsburgs ===

In 1493, not far away from the Plitvice Lakes a decisive battle in Croatian history between Kingdom of Croatia (then in personal union with Hungary) and Ottoman Empire took place. During the Battle of Krbava Field almost the entire Croatian nobility was killed. The Ottomans advanced far into Western lands up to Croatia and Hungary. In 1527, the Croatian Parliament elected the Habsburg monarch Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria as the new king of Croatia in the hope of resources to ward off the Ottoman advance. In 1528, the area fell to the Ottomans and was retaken by the Habsburg Empire 150 years later.

In 1538, king Ferdinand I ordered the establishment of the Croatian Military Frontier as a borderland of Habsburg Austria to the Ottoman Empire. The laws that prevailed in this area under special jurisdiction had formative impact on the local population for centuries. As a consequence of the establishment of this special regime, people abandoned these areas in great masses towards the West.

In addition to the native Croats already inhabiting the region and serving in the Austrian military, many central Europeans migrated to the region as did Serb Orthodox refugees fleeing Ottoman repression, who were given refuge in the abandoned areas in exchange for military service. The entire population of the military frontier, particularly the so-called frontiersmen, had the duty to protect this area of permanent unrest and terrible destruction. The region once also used to be called &quot;the garden of the devil (hortus diabolus&quot;).

The Ottomans succeeded several times to gain control over the area of the Plitvice Lakes for shorter periods. In 1788, this area permanently fell back under Habsburg rule. When the Ottoman threat subsided, the Military Frontier was reverted to the civilian control of the Croatian viceroy (Ban). The area then formed part of Banovina of Croatia within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and then part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia within the Socialist Yugoslavia. Today, it is part of the Republic of Croatia.

In 1805, another major rule change happened, which created an economic upturn. Dalmatia and Lika fell under the rule of Napoleon, who founded the Illyrian provinces. After 1814, the area of the Plitvice Lakes came back under Habsburg rule. From 1850, only professional soldiers served in the Military Frontier. This was also a time of national awakening in Croatia. In 1871, the famous Croatian politician Eugen Kvaternik was killed north of the lakes at Rakovica. The Croatian rebellion was put down by Austrian authorities. Kvaternik propagated the rule of law and argued for the liberation from Austrian-Hungarian predominance.

=== Farmlands becoming an area of recreation ===

In former times, the local population lacked the proper comprehension of the natural values of the Plitvice Lakes. Farmers had to focus on securing the daily bread for their families in these dour times, which was accompanied by grave changes to nature. For example, smaller lakes were filled up with earth or people adapted the flow of the rivers to their individual needs.

Already in 1861, an accommodation for travelers was erected at &quot;Velika Poljana&quot;. The local population called this accommodation the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s house&quot;, since imperial military officers used to reside in this location. For the visit of Crown Princess Stéphanie of Belgium, the wife of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria in 1888, the Plitvice Lakes and their surroundings were arranged for tourist purposes for the first time in history. Two paths still bear the names of the daughters of the Emperor Franz Joseph: &quot;&quot;Stephanie&#x27;s Path&quot; (Croatian Štefanijin put&quot;) and &quot;&quot;Dorothea&#x27;s Path&quot; (&quot;).

In 1890, the tradesman Ante Devčić from Senj built the first hotel with a restaurant at Prošćansko jezero. However, he exaggerated in his efforts and also caused partly irreparable damage on the nature. For example, he constructed canals across the travertine barriers for his saw mill that are visible even today.

At the same place, today called &quot;Labudovac&quot;, Gustav Janeček, a Czech from Zagreb, built a restaurant and accommodation. In 1893, Janeček founded the &quot;Society for the preservation of the Plitvice Lakes&quot; (Croatian &quot;Društvo za uređenje i poljepšanje Plitvičkih jezera&quot;), with the aim of preserving the lakes after all negative influence they have been exposed to. The society also built a hotel at the lakes. In 1898, one of the waterfalls was named after Croatian opera singer Milka Ternina. She gave money from concerts to preserve the park, upgrade tracks and build pathways.

During the First World War, the Croatian parliament in Zagreb passed the &quot;Law on the Protection of the Plitvice Lakes&quot; in 1916. However, this law did not contain adequate measures of protection and is thus not regarded as official founding declaration of the national park.

During the following decades, preservation efforts reached a deadlock. However, some very significant meetings took place at the Plitvice Lakes during the Second World War, as for example the first secret regional conference of the League of Communists of Croatia (Croatian: &quot;Savez komunista Hrvatske, SKH&quot;) in 1940. On June 14, 1943 one of the founding sessions of the National Anti-Fascist Council of the People&#x27;s Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH) took place at Plitvice Lakes. This was the highest governing organ of the anti-fascist movement in Croatia during World War II. The former Secretary General of the Communist Party of Croatia, Rade Končar, was born in Končarev Kraj at the Plitvice Lakes in 1911.

=== The lakes as national park ===
After the end of the Second World War, the unique natural phenomena of this area were acknowledged permanently. On April 8, 1949, the Plitvice Lakes were declared as a national park area and rigorous nature protection measures were established.

During the 1960s, a modern road connection to the Plitvice Lakes was constructed, which led to increasing traffic volumes. During these years, several hotels and other objects were erected according to innovative plans of Croatian architects. However, some buildings that would fit current standards were already demolished during the 1980s by the Communist authorities.

Between 1962 and 1968, many Western film productions of Karl May novels were shot at the Plitvice Lakes (mainly German-French-Yugoslav coproductions). The most successful film of this series, &quot;Treasure of the Silver Lake&quot; was also produced at some locations within the national park. (Kaluđerovac in the lower lakes served as scenery for the Silver Lake.)

During the 1970s, detailed land registers of the national park were recorded. The park was inscribed on the UNESCO World Natural Heritage List in 1979 in recognition of its &quot;outstanding natural beauty, and the undisturbed production of travertine (tufa) through chemical and biological action&quot;.
During the 1980s, tourism was booming in Yugoslavia. Plitvice Lakes National Park soon became one of Yugoslavia&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions. The beginning of the 1990s, however, marked another great turning point in the history of this national park. In March 1991 it became the scene of the Plitvice Lakes incident (also called the &quot;Plitvice Bloody Easter&quot;), the first armed confrontation of the Croatian War of Independence that resulted in fatalities. The park was held by local Serb rebels backed by Slobodan Milošević and the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) as part of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina during the conflict and suffered some damage in the process, with hotels and other facilities being used as barracks. During the period under the control of Serb forces loyal to Belgrade, Croats were ethnically cleansed from the region systematically. The region was retaken by the Croatian Army in August 1995 during Operation Storm, and the majority of the Serb population was expelled.

During the war from 1991 until 1995, many buildings in the national park were destroyed or burnt down. Because of the apparent risk of mines, the park was placed on the UNESCO List of World Heritage in Danger during the war years. After the war, the Plitvice Lakes were among the first areas to be cleared of mines and renovated, although some of the more remote areas in the park are suspected still to contain landmines. In 1998, the national park was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger. In 2000, the national park was expanded by a further in order to protect the underground tributary streams.

Within the national park continuous scientific research projects are being carried out. The national park administration currently endeavors to introduce new, progressive protection measures. There is a proposal to replace the wooden bridges and paths by floating pontoon bridges. The existing wooden paths are anchored within the travertine sediments, creating the danger of seepage and cracks of the weak travertine.

The Plitvice Lakes are one of the most frequently visited tourist attractions in Croatia. Their natural, cultural and tourist significance has become a motor for the local economy. About 1,000,000 visitors per year greatly contribute to the economic development of the wider region.

Because of high tourism and illegal construction around the lakes, with faecal waste flowing down to surrounding woods and lakes without any treatment, the water in the lakes is polluted and no longer drinkable. In its current state, UNESCO threatens to remove the park&#x27;s status as a World Natural Heritage site.

== Local customs and traditions ==
The preservation of old customs and traditions is of high significance for the local population. The local culture has also been detected as an important factor for tourism. As regards architecture, the region of Lika is well known for its low wooden houses with roofs made of rye straw or shingles. Many features of the ancient living style are mirrored in local costumes. They tell a lot about regional affiliations or social standings of those who have worn those costumes. Under French rule, men were allowed to wear their costumes during military service.

Up until the 20th century, social gatherings during the winter months, when no agricultural activities could be performed, called &quot;prelo&quot; represented a typical tradition of this region. These gatherings served for the joint production of textiles or butter or for the further processing of harvest products (production of flour, etc.). These activities used to be accompanied by drinks and dances, particularly during the evenings. A well-known dance of this region is the round dance (Croatian &quot;kolo&quot;).

Local cuisine consists of drinks, such as slivovitz (), wine and coffee or dishes, such as soft cheese (&quot;vrhnje&quot;), polenta, &quot;pršut&quot;, paprika sausage, roasted suckling pig (&quot;odojak&quot;) or lamb (&quot;janjetina&quot;).

== Lake names and anecdotes ==
Each of the Plitvice Lakes has a story or legend to tell. Most lake names stem from true events.

== Comparable phenomena worldwide ==
Comparable phenomena to those prevailing at the Plitvice Lakes exist at Rastoke (Slunj), at the Krka National Park, at the rivers Una and the Pliva in Bosnia and Herzegovina and at the Krushuna Falls in Bulgaria. The Band-e Amir lakes within the Hindu Kush mountain range form a similar system of lakes and dams, though diverging tufa formation processes prevail. Calc-sinter formation processes that have not emerged along a river flow can be observed at the Mammoth Hot Springs within Yellowstone National Park (USA) or at Pamukkale in Turkey. Jiuzhaigou is a nature reserve and national park located in the north of Sichuan, China. Also inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, its landscape of cascading lakes is made up of high-altitude karsts shaped by glacial, hydrological and tectonic activity. The area around Ocho Rios Jamaica is another region famous for its calc-sinter rivers. Most popular, particularly with cruise ships, is Dunn&#x27;s River Falls.

<text>ChalkZone is an American animated television series created by Bill Burnett and Larry Huber for Nickelodeon. The series follows Rudy Tabootie, an elementary school student who discovers a box of magic chalk that allows him to draw portals into the ChalkZone, an alternate dimension where everything ever drawn with chalk and later erased comes to life. Rudy is joined in his adventures by Snap, a wisecracking superhero Rudy once drew with chalk, and Penny Sanchez, Rudy&#x27;s academically intellectual classmate and personal friend.

&quot;ChalkZone&quot; originally premiered as a pilot short on Fred Seibert&#x27;s &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; animated shorts showcase in 1998. The series ran on Nickelodeon from March 22, 2002, to August 23, 2008, with 40 episodes in total. It was produced by Frederator Studios and Nickelodeon Animation Studio.

==Premise==
The series follows Rudy Tabootie (voiced by E. G. Daily), a 10-year-old, fifth-grade boy who loves to draw. Reggie Bullnerd (Candi Milo), the school bully, constantly teases him or gets him into trouble with Mr. Wilter (Robert Cait), Rudy&#x27;s grumpy school teacher who strongly dislikes cartoons, especially Rudy&#x27;s passion for art. One day while in detention, Rudy discovers a piece of &quot;White Lightnin&#x27;&quot; chalk, which allows access to the ChalkZone, a place where everything and everyone that has ever been drawn in chalk and erased exists as living/tangible entities. He soon makes friends with Snap (Candi Milo), a short, blue, humanoid drawing made by Rudy when he was eight years old. Snap wears a superhero outfit and is very adventurous and funny. Rudy only lets one other person know about ChalkZone, his best friend Penny Sanchez (speaking voice, Hynden Walch; singing voice, Robbyn Kirmssè), who acts as the genius of the group.

While in ChalkZone, the three are introduced to Cyclops (Rodger Bumpass), the kilt-wearing guardian of the magic chalk mines where Rudy obtains his magic chalk (Rudy later draws a second eye for him and renames him &quot;Biclops&quot;); Queen Rapsheeba (Rosslynn Taylor), ChalkZone&#x27;s musical artist whom Snap has a crush on; and Blocky (Candi Milo; Robert Cait), a light green block friend of Snap&#x27;s and Rudy&#x27;s first-ever drawing. They also face villains such as Skrawl (Jim Cummings), a drawing who blames Rudy for being ugly and wants to destroy him, and the Craniacs (Rob Paulsen), a series of robot drawings obsessed with collecting futuristic devices.

He gets into trouble all the time and even has a school record with its own file drawer.
* Joseph Walter &quot;Joe&quot; Tabootie (voiced by Jess Harnell) is Rudy&#x27;s father, who runs a meat shop. His voice resembles that of Ned Flanders from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, but in a high-distorted pitch.
* Mildred Trish &quot;Millie&quot; Tabootie (voiced by Miriam Flynn) is Rudy&#x27;s mother, who calls Rudy down in an opera singing-esque voice.
* Horace T. Wilter (voiced by Robert Cait): Horace is Rudy&#x27;s cartoon-hating school teacher, despite that he once enjoyed cartoons when he was younger.

==Production==
&quot;ChalkZone&quot; was the creation of Bill Burnett and Larry Huber, with Huber&#x27;s idea of a boy with magic chalk and Burnett&#x27;s idea of a world behind the chalkboard. The concept&#x27;s origin dated back during the production of Hanna Barbera&#x27;s &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; where Seibert originally wanted Huber to develop a cartoon for the showcase and assigned him with Burnett, who was writing for &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; at the time, to develop a pilot for a potential series. Development fell through at the last minute from the result of Warner Bros. Animation acquiring Hanna Barbera Cartoons. The concept came back when Seibert developed Frederator Studios and was pitched as a short on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; before getting the greenlight in 1998. In 1999, &quot;ChalkZone&quot; became the first spin-off of &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; to enter production and be greenlit. Despite this, &quot;ChalkZone&quot; did not make it to the air until 2002, as the initial 13 green-light episodes were shortened to 6 due to executive reasons, all which were completed by 2000. The show&#x27;s air-date was up for debate until the lack of new programming and America&#x27;s critical situation at the time led the decision to air the series in 2002. Frederator Studios announced in 2005 that the series had been cancelled at 40 episodes.

The show is remembered for featuring one-minute music videos sung by Rudy and his friends (credited as &quot;Rudy &amp; The Chalkzone Band&quot;) at the end of each episode. Several songs Bill Burnett composed before &quot;ChalkZone&quot;&#x27;s production, i.e. &quot;Insect Aside&quot; and &quot;Dream Alotta Dreams&quot;, were implanted into the series. A well-liked rumor about the show is that it was based on &quot;Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings&quot; (which Nickelodeon aired in the early 1980s as part of &quot;Pinwheel&quot;). Bill Burnett denied this in a 2013 interview, claiming that he was not aware of the series&#x27; existence until after &quot;ChalkZone&quot; entered production, although Burnett did mention that &quot;Harold and the Purple Crayon&quot; was an influence on Larry&#x27;s idea for the &quot;boy with magic chalk&quot; concept. A one-hour special, &quot;The Big Blow Up&quot;, premiered on August 6, 2004. The final season featured new character designs with a slimmer line quality and a zooming chalk transition as new artists and overseas studios were used for the remainder of the series.

The show had four different variations of the theme song released to the public, one from the 2001 Nickelodeon album, &quot;The Newest Nicktoons&quot;, which used a synthesizer instead of a guitar and had an earlier version of Penny&#x27;s voice which was a demo Bill Burnett created in order for the song to get the green-light, an earlier version of the final version from the album &quot;ChalkZone: In the Zone&quot;, where the guitar was used and Penny&#x27;s earlier voice was still used, and the final version which was shown on regular episodes. Another variation was shown in the 1999 pilot, which not only featured a slightly different opening sequence and logo from the final series but also features a preparatory track mix of the final version and the second demo albeit with some modified vocals, also with Penny&#x27;s final voice used. Bill Burnett&#x27;s original idea for the concepts&#x27; score was something in akin to simplistic children&#x27;s toy instrument melodies to fit the show&#x27;s children&#x27;s &quot;chalk-drawing&quot; theme, but the Nickelodeon crew suggested a more techno rock-based score to give the show a huge contrast from the premise. Steve Rucker was brought into the music composition team and some of his compositions were later re-written upon request by Burnett and Moon to fit the series better, much to his dismay.

==Broadcast==
The pilot for the series first aired on December 31, 1999, as part of Nickelodeon&#x27;s annual New Year&#x27;s Eve block, but due to being delayed by Nickelodeon for executive reasons, the series made its official premiere on March 22, 2002. The 2002 premiere became the highest-rated premiere in Nickelodeon&#x27;s history up to that point.

The show aired in reruns on &quot;Nick on CBS&quot; for more than a year from February 1, 2003, to September 11, 2004. In June 2005, following the announcement that the series had been cancelled, the fourth season of the series premiered. Of the season&#x27;s 11 episodes, only five would be aired that year before Nickelodeon abruptly halted the broadcast of new episodes. The remaining six episodes would not air until three years later in June and August 2008. The final episode aired on August 23, 2008.

Since the series&#x27; cancellation, reruns aired on Nicktoons until October 30, 2016. &quot;ChalkZone&quot; reruns aired on NickSplat (then known as &quot;The Splat&quot;) for two nights only on November 12 and 13, 2016, as part of a block that ran every weekend from August until December commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Nicktoons franchise. NickSplat –including &quot;ChalkZone&quot;– was a subscription channel based on VRV from 2018 to 2020.

==Home media==
During the show&#x27;s original run, there were no DVD releases specifically for &quot;ChalkZone&quot;. The episode &quot;Future Zone&quot; was released on the &quot;Nickstravaganza!&quot; VHS. Three episodes (&quot;Gift Adrift&quot;, &quot;French Fry Falls&quot;, and &quot;Eschucha Mi Corazon&quot;) were released for the &quot;Nickstravaganza! 2&quot; DVD (only &quot;French Fry Falls&quot; was included on the VHS). The Christmas episode, &quot;When Santas Collide&quot;, was featured on the 2006 DVD &quot;Nick Picks Holiday&quot;. A &quot;Complete Series&quot; DVD set was released through Amazon.com&#x27;s CreateSpace manufacture-on-demand program on October 13, 2014; the release is missing the episode &quot;The Smooch&quot; due to music licensing issues. A soundtrack album &quot;In the Zone&quot; has also been released. The entire series is available on Amazon Video and the PlayStation Store, as well as available for streaming on Paramount+.
==Reception==

===Critical===
Joly Herman of Common Sense Media rated the series 3 out of 5 stars, saying, &quot;What makes this show interesting is that it acknowledges that worlds of imagination are available to all of us. But while it&#x27;s true that we love to get lost in a story, for a young child, getting as lost in a world as Rudy does can be scary.&quot; Lana Berkowitz from &quot;The Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;There are flashes of fun in [&quot;ChalkZone&quot;], the action moves along, and there&#x27;s no violence. But cartoon connoisseurs, particularly those who stay tuned after loony &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; at 7 p.m., probably will need something more intriguing to keep their attention.&quot; Berkowitz further added, &quot;After a clever setup, &quot;Chalkzone&quot; settles into a predictable zone with stories that could easily be erased from memory.&quot; Allison Fass of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the imagination and creativity in the series, but she opined that series creator Bill Burnett&#x27;s message, &quot;We have to take responsibility for what we create&quot;, may be &quot;a little mature&quot; for children.

<text>Stollberg is a former district in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the district-free city Chemnitz, and the districts Mittlerer Erzgebirgskreis, Annaberg, Aue-Schwarzenberg, Zwickauer Land and Chemnitzer Land.

== History ==
The district dates back to the &quot;Amtshauptmannschaft Stollberg&quot;, which was established in 1910. In 1939 it was renamed to &quot;Landkreis&quot;. In 1950 the district was dissolved and its municipalities were assigned to the neighboring districts Aue, Chemnitz and Zwickau. However two years later in another reform the district was recreated, only with a slightly different layout. In the communal reform of 1994 the district was enlarged by some municipalities from the district Chemnitz, and the city Zwönitz from the district Aue. On 1 August 2008 it was merged into the new district Erzgebirgskreis.

== Geography ==
The district was located on the northwestern slope of the Ore Mountains.

==Partnerships==
Since 1990 the district had a partnership with the district Fürth in Bavaria.

== Coat of arms ==
The left half of the coat of arms show the symbol of the Counts of Schönberg - the county of Schönberg covered most of the area of the district. To the right is the imperial eagle symbolizing the Pleissnerland, an imperial estate. The colours of the right side are also identical with those of Meissen, as another part of the district historically belonged to the County of Meissen.

<doc id="342109" wikidata="Q920646" url="?curid=342109" title="Haywards Heath">
<text>Haywards Heath ( ) is a town in West Sussex, England, south of London, north of Brighton, south of Gatwick Airport and northeast of the county town, Chichester. Nearby towns include Burgess Hill to the southwest, Horsham to the northwest, Crawley northwest and East Grinstead northeast. With only a relatively small number of jobs available in the immediate vicinity, mostly in the agricultural or service sector, many residents work remotely or commute daily via road or rail to London, Brighton, Crawley or Gatwick Airport.

==Etymology==
The first element of the place-name Haywards Heath is derived from the Old English &quot;hege&quot; + &quot;worð&quot;, meaning hedge enclosure, with the later addition of &quot;hǣð&quot;. The place-name was first recorded in 1261 as &quot;Heyworth&quot;, then in 1359 as &quot;Hayworthe&quot;, in 1544 as &quot;Haywards Hoth&quot; (i.e. &#x27;heath by the enclosure with a hedge&#x27;), and in 1607 as &quot;Hayworths Hethe&quot;.

There is a local legend that the name comes from a highwayman who went under the name of Jack Hayward.

==History==

Haywards Heath&#x27;s Muster Green was the site of the Battle of Muster Green, a minor battle that took place in early December 1642 during the First English Civil War between a Royalist army under Edward Ford, High Sheriff of Sussex, and a smaller (but more disciplined) Parliamentarian army under Herbert Morley. Due to the fact that neither side possessed field guns, hand-to-hand combat ensued and after roughly an hour of fighting and 200 Royalists killed or wounded, the Parliamentarians emerged victorious and routed the Royalist army.

Haywards Heath is located in the east of the ancient parish of Cuckfield. A separate civil parish and urban district of Haywards Heath was created in 1894. From 1934 to 1974 Cuckfield, Haywards Heath and Lindfield were combined to form Cuckfield Urban District, but since 1974 the three settlements have had separate councils again.

Haywards Heath as a settlement is a relatively modern development. Following the arrival of the London &amp; Brighton Railway in 1841, its size increased considerably. Haywards Heath railway station opened on 12 July 1841 and served as the southern terminus of the line until the completion of Brighton station on 21 September. The position of Haywards Heath, and its place on both this railway and near the main road (A23) between London and Brighton, enables it to function as a commuter town, with many residents working in London, Brighton, Crawley and Gatwick Airport.
Other noted historical events in the town&#x27;s history include:
* The opening of the Sussex County Lunatic Asylum (later called St Francis Hospital) in 1859. The superintendent here was, for many years, Dr Lockhart Robertson, later Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Visitor.
* The opening of Bannister&#x27;s Cattle Market, the 12th largest in the UK at one point, in 1859. This was closed to make way for a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket in 1989.
* The opening of Victorian and Edwardian villas built as early commuter settlements in 1894
* The opening of the Eliot Cottage Hospital, later King Edward VII Eliot Memorial Hospital, in 1906, named after benefactor, Alice Annie Eliot (1864–1904)
* Schemes in the 1920s helped families on low incomes to become self-sufficient, resulting in the building of Franklands Village in the 1930s.

In the 1960s and 1970s, two light industrial estates were built. Office development has lately resulted in the town being a regional or national centre for a number of national companies and government agencies.

The population has risen from 200 in the early 1850s to 22,800 (2001 census), making it one of the larger towns in West Sussex. The area of the civil parish is .

The parish church, dedicated to St Wilfrid, and the Roman Catholic church of St Paul are among the churches and chapels in Haywards Heath. Other places of worship include the Methodist church in Perrymount Road and two Baptist churches, St Richards (C of E), the Church of the Presentation (C of E) and the Ascension Church (C of E).

The Priory of Our Lady of Good Counsel on Franklynn Road was built in 1886 and is Grade II listed.

Haywards Heath was in East Sussex, but a change to the county boundary in 1974 brought it under the jurisdiction of West Sussex. Haywards Heath Town Hall was completed in 1990.

== Governance ==
Haywards Heath has a town council, consisting of 16 councillors. As of the 2023 local elections, the council is run by the Liberal Democrats, with seats held as follows:

The current mayor of Haywards Heath is Stéphanie Inglesfield.

=== Climate policy ===
In 2022, Haywards Heath Town Council endorsed the &quot;Plant Based Treaty&quot; campaign (a global, climate crisis initiative similar to the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative).

== Housing developments ==

=== Sunnywood Drive ===
in 1934 the architects Berthold Lubetkin and Tecton obtained planning permission for some modernist-style houses. Unconventionally, they are built with brick and with flat roofs. Seven buildings were built of which a pair were semi-detached. The walls were built of cavity brick walls but certain features were built in concrete window frames, balconies, built-in flower boxes and porches. The houses were originally sold at £975- £1200 each.

===Bolnore Village ===

Housing in Haywards Heath expanded significantly in the first decade of the 21st century due to the creation of Bolnore Village, located to the southwest of the existing town. Planning permission was first granted in the late 1990s for 780 new homes on a greenfield site. The first house was completed in October 2002. Since then, phases 1, 2, 3, 4a and 5 have been built by the house builders Crest Nicholson in conjunction with several other developers. Housing was followed by the construction of various commercial units and Bolnore Village Primary School, which was the country&#x27;s first self-governing parent-promoted primary school in September 2010.

The decision to grant planning permission for Bolnore Village was somewhat controversial since the Ashenground and Catts Woods on that site formed a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI).

As a condition for planning permission, the developers were required to build a relief road for the town, often referred to as the Haywards Heath by-pass, which has rerouted the A272 to the south side of the town. Construction work on the relief road commenced in 2012; on its completion in August 2014, the previous A272 route through Haywards Heath was renumbered the B2272.

In 2008, local residents won a bid to set up and run their own primary school for the village. The new school opened in September 2008.

=== Future ===
As Bolnore village&#x27;s construction has nearly finished the majority of new housing for Haywards Heath has been on the southern side of the A272, the site is commonly referred to as Sandrocks after the house that was previously there. This area has 6 main development areas, of which 2 have been completed as of Summer 2018.

New housing developments have also appeared on the northern side of the town. Both of them allow approx 400 new dwellings to be built. The first one is on the northern end of Penland Road and south of Hanlye Lane and started development in 2017. The other one is between Lindfield and Walstead. This started in 2015.

There are also plans that the land around Hurstwood Farm will be built on, with the provision of a new primary school, Country Park and allotments included in the master plan which has received planning permission.

==Transport links==
===Rail===

Haywards Heath railway station is a major station on the Brighton Main Line. Some of the train services divide at Haywards Heath before continuing their journey to the south or join other services before continuing north.

Haywards Heath has trains terminating at: London Victoria, Bedford, Cambridge, Brighton, Eastbourne and Littlehampton.

===Road===
Haywards Heath is primarily served by the A272 road, which runs around the south side of the town. This is the new Haywards Heath by-pass, which was opened (ahead of schedule) in August 2014. It diverts town centre traffic south of the town, just south of Bolnore Village, Ashenground and the Princess Royal Hospital. The old A272 through the town centre is now the B2272. Following the A272 to the west, it joins the A23 trunk road which runs both to Brighton to the south and London to the north via the M23.

The town is also connected to Burgess Hill to the south via the A273, B2036 and B2112.

== Education ==

===State schools===

Oathall Community College is a secondary school for the town and surrounding area. Facilities include a school farm. Additionally, in the nearby village of Cuckfield, Warden Park Secondary Academy (part of the Sussex Learning Trust) provides education to c. 1500 students from the surrounding areas, including the village where it&#x27;s situated - Cuckfield - as well as Haywards Heath, Ansty, Bolnore, Balcombe and other towns and villages.

Haywards Heath is also home to a number of local primary schools, one of which is St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, located on Hazelgrove Road near the centre of the town. Additionally, other nearby schools include St Wilfrid&#x27;s, Harlands Primary School, Warden Park Primary Academy, Lindfield Primary Academy and Bolnore Village Primary School.

In September 2020, a new Chichester College campus opened, called Haywards Heath College. The college uses the old Central Sussex College Haywards Heath campus on Harlands Road which closed in Summer 2017. The current principal is the former Worthing College principal.

===Private schools===

*Tavistock and Summerhill School (1973–2015)
*Great Walstead School
*Ardingly College
*Hurstpierpoint College
*Burgess Hill School For Girls
*Worth School
*Cumnor House

== Twin towns ==

Haywards Heath is twinned with:

* Bondues, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, France
* Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany

The section of the A272 that runs south beside Bolnore Village has been named Traunstein Way and there is a German postbox outside the Town Hall to commemorate the link.

==Sport and leisure==

Haywards Heath has two Non-League football clubs, Haywards Heath Town F.C. who play at Hanbury Park and St Francis Rangers F.C. who play at The Colwell Ground.

Haywards Heath is home to No5 (Haywards Heath) Detachment, C Company of the Sussex Army Cadet Force, a volunteer youth organisation, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, which accepts cadets aged between 12 and 18 years of age.

Haywards Heath also has a rugby union team.

The area has two hockey clubs nearby: St Francis Hockey Club and Mid Sussex Hockey Club. They both play their home games at The Triangle leisure centre in Burgess Hill and have a shared clubhouse based in Haywards Heath.

Haywards Heath is also home to the Dolphin Leisure Centre. Managed by Places Leisure, amenities include a swimming pool, sports halls, gymnasium and park.

<doc id="342113" wikidata="Q634307" url="?curid=342113" title="Archimedes number">
<text>In viscous fluid dynamics, the Archimedes number (Ar), is a dimensionless number used to determine the motion of fluids due to density differences, named after the ancient Greek scientist and mathematician Archimedes.

It is the ratio of gravitational forces to viscous forces and has the form:

:formula_1

where:

* formula_2 is the local external field (for example gravitational acceleration), ,
* formula_3 is the characteristic length of body, .
* formula_4 is the submerged specific gravity,
* formula_5 is the density of the fluid, ,
* formula_6 is the density of the body, ,
* formula_7 is the kinematic viscosity, ,
* formula_8 is the dynamic viscosity, ,

== Uses ==
The Archimedes number is generally used in design of tubular chemical process reactors. The following are non-exhaustive examples of using the Archimedes number in reactor design.

=== Packed-bed fluidization design ===
The Archimedes number is applied often in the engineering of packed beds, which are very common in the chemical processing industry. A packed bed reactor, which is similar to the ideal plug flow reactor model, involves packing a tubular reactor with a solid catalyst, then passing incompressible or compressible fluids through the solid bed. When the solid particles are small, they may be &quot;fluidized&quot;, so that they act as if they were a fluid. When fluidizing a packed bed, the pressure of the working fluid is increased until the pressure drop between the bottom of the bed (where fluid enters) and the top of the bed (where fluid leaves) is equal to the weight of the packed solids. At this point, the velocity of the fluid is just not enough to achieve fluidization, and extra pressure is required to overcome the friction of particles with each other and the wall of the reactor, allowing fluidization to occur. This gives a minimum fluidization velocity, formula_9, that may be estimated by:

:formula_10

where:
* formula_11 is the diameter of sphere with the same volume as the solid particle and can often be estimated as formula_12, where formula_13 is the diameter of the particle.

=== Bubble column design ===
Another use is in the estimation of gas holdup in a bubble column. In a bubble column, the gas holdup (fraction of a bubble column that is gas at a given time) can be estimated by:

:formula_14

where:

*formula_15 is the gas holdup fraction
*formula_16 is the Eötvos number
* formula_17 is the Froude number
* formula_18 is the diameter of holes in the column&#x27;s spargers (holed discs that emit bubbles)
* formula_19 is the column diameter
* Parameters formula_20 to formula_21 are found empirically

=== Spouted-bed minimum spouting velocity design ===
A spouted bed is used in drying and coating. It involves spraying a liquid into a bed packed with the solid to be coated. A fluidizing gas fed from the bottom of the bed causes a spout, which causes the solids to circle linearly around the liquid. Work has been undertaken to model the minimum velocity of gas required for spouting in a spouted bed, including the use of artificial neural networks. Testing with such models found that Archimedes number is a parameter that has a very large effect on the minimum spouting velocity.

<doc id="342119" wikidata="Q2335099" url="?curid=342119" title="Yamaha YM2612">
<text>The YM2612, a.k.a. OPN2, is a sound chip developed by Yamaha. It is a member of Yamaha&#x27;s OPN family of FM synthesis chips, and is derived from the YM2203.

The YM2612 is a six-channel FM synthesizer used in several game and computer systems, most notably in Sega&#x27;s Mega Drive/Genesis video game console as well as Fujitsu&#x27;s FM Towns computer series. It was also available in CMOS form as the YM3438, a.k.a. OPN2C.

As with the YM3438, it was used by Sega in various arcade game systems, including the Mega-Play, Sega System C and Sega System 32; the YM3438 core was also integrated into an ASIC in later revisions of the Mega Drive/Genesis.

==Features==
The YM2612 has the following features:
*Six concurrent FM synthesis channels (voices)
*Four operators per channel
*Two interval timers
*A sine-wave low frequency oscillator (LFO)
*Integrated stereo output digital-to-analog converter (most other contemporary Yamaha FM chips require a separate external D/A converter chip)
*Per-channel programmable stereo sound (left, right, or both left and right resulting in centre)
*For channel three, operator frequencies can be set independently, making dissonant harmonics possible. (Normally, they would have a simple relation like e.g. 2× or 3× relative to a common base frequency) This is a common feature of the OPN family of chips.

== Technical details ==
The YM2612&#x27;s FM synthesis block is an extended version of the FM block featured in the YM2203, adding three additional FM channels and integrating a stereo output DAC. The YM2612 removes the SSG component (although retaining its envelope generators) and GPIO ports found in the YM2203 and YM2608, which were elements of the integrated YM2149F core on the other OPN chips. While the YM2612 was mainly based on the YM2203, it was often referred to as being based on the YM2608 due to a number of similarities between the two sound chips, only lacking the latter&#x27;s ADPCM channels among other aforementioned changes.

Whereas the high-end OPN chips such as the YM2608 have dedicated ADPCM channels for playing sampled audio, the YM2612 does not. However, its sixth channel can act as a basic PCM channel by means of the &#x27;DAC Enable&#x27; register, disabling FM output for that channel but allowing it to play 8-bit pulse-code modulation sound samples. Unlike the other OPNs with ADPCM, the YM2612 does not provide any timing or buffering of samples, so all frequency control and buffering must be done in software by the host processor.

=== Low volume distortion of the built-in DAC ===
Unlike most Yamaha FM chips which require an external floating-point DAC, the YM2612 features a built-in 9-bit DAC, which uses time-division multiplexing to play one sample of each channel in sequence, similar to the YM2413.

Due to an error with the amplitude voltage in the original chip design, a peculiar form of crossover distortion known as &quot;low volume distortion&quot; (and historically known as the &quot;ladder effect&quot; or &quot;TDM distortion&quot;) is introduced in the output. Any output that is sufficiently low in volume undergoes an exaggerated quantization, including any usage of fades in video game music.

Some early games in the Mega Drive/Genesis&#x27; lifespan such as After Burner II had their music written around this distortion; as a consequence, the music would sound too quiet on later Mega Drive/Genesis consoles using the integrated YM3438 core on the ASIC. Also, because of the reduced dynamic range of the built-in DAC, additional distortion may be generated when playing sounds with a very high volume.

In recent years, improvements in accuracy of the emulation of the sound chips resulted in the low volume distortion bug in the YM2612 being faithfully replicated in software, and many recent Mega Drive/Genesis emulators since have offered this feature as an option to replicate the sound outputs of the original and revised models of the Mega Drive/Genesis. It also allowed other variants of the YM2612 that had reduced the low volume distortion bug such as the YM3438 to be emulated and implemented in many Mega Drive/Genesis emulators as well.

=== Variants ===

==== Yamaha YM3438 ====
The YM3438, a.k.a. OPN2C, is a modified CMOS version of the YM2612, commonly used in Sega&#x27;s arcade system boards. This version has an improved built-in DAC that significantly reduces the presence of crossover distortion from the original chip with a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the YM2612. It is not a direct, drop-in replacement for the YM2612 however, as the sound outputs have higher impedance.

==== Yamaha YMF276 ====
The YMF276, a.k.a. OPN2L, is a low-powered version of the YM3438, used in later models of the Fujitsu FM Towns series (particularly the FM Towns II models). It came in a smaller 24-pin SOP package. Unlike the YM2612 and YM3438, the YMF276 requires an external DAC chip, similar to most other Yamaha FM chips. This is usually a YM3433B external DAC chip (as used in the FM Towns II models) or other equivalent DAC chips. As such, it does not produce significant low volume distortion as with the YM2612/YM3438 chips due to its usage of an external DAC chip.

==== Sega Mega Drive/Genesis ASICs made by Yamaha (FC1004, FF1004, FJ3002 and FQ8007) ====
The YM3438 core was integrated in custom ASICs used in the final revision of the Model 1 version and most revisions of the Model 2 version of the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, as well as the Genesis 3 released by Majesco. The YM3438 core in these revisions further reduced the presence of the low volume distortion bug more so than with standalone YM3438 chips.

== Game audio ==
Used in conjunction with the Texas Instruments SN76489 PSG as the main sound generators of the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis console, the YM2612 was prominently utilized by numerous prolific video game music composers, most notably Yuzo Koshiro.

<doc id="342127" wikidata="Q575625" url="?curid=342127" title="Anti-gravity">
<text>Anti-gravity (also known as non-gravitational field) is the phenomenon of creating a place or object that is free from the force of gravity. It does not refer to either the lack of weight under gravity experienced in free fall or orbit, or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force, such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift. Anti-gravity is a recurring concept in science fiction.

&quot;Anti-gravity&quot; is often used to refer to devices that look as if they reverse gravity even though they operate through other means, such as lifters, which fly in the air by moving air with electromagnetic fields.

==Historical attempts at understanding gravity==

The possibility of creating anti-gravity depends upon a complete understanding and description of gravity and its interactions with other physical theories, such as general relativity and quantum mechanics; however, no quantum theory of gravity has yet been found.

During the summer of 1666, Isaac Newton observed an apple falling from the tree in his garden, thus realizing the principle of universal gravitation. Albert Einstein in 1915 considered the physical interaction between matter and space, where gravity occurs as a consequence of matter causing a geometric deformation of spacetime which is otherwise flat. Einstein, both independently and with Walther Mayer, attempted to unify his theory of gravity with electromagnetism using the work of Theodor Kaluza and James Clerk Maxwell to link gravity and quantum field theory.

Theoretical quantum physicists have postulated the existence of a quantum gravity particle, the graviton. Various theoretical explanations of quantum gravity have been created, including superstring theory, loop quantum gravity, E8 theory and asymptotic safety theory amongst many others.

==Probable solutions==
In Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, gravity was an external force transmitted by unknown means. In the 20th century, Newton&#x27;s model was replaced by general relativity where gravity is not a force but the result of the geometry of spacetime. Under general relativity, anti-gravity is impossible except under contrived circumstances.

===Gravity shields===

In 1948 businessman Roger Babson (founder of Babson College) formed the Gravity Research Foundation to study ways to reduce the effects of gravity. Their efforts were initially somewhat &quot;crankish&quot;, but they held occasional conferences that drew such people as Clarence Birdseye, known for his frozen-food products, and helicopter pioneer Igor Sikorsky. Over time the Foundation turned its attention away from trying to control gravity, to simply better understanding it. The Foundation nearly disappeared after Babson&#x27;s death in 1967. However, it continues to run an essay award, offering prizes of up to $4,000. As of 2017, it is still administered out of Wellesley, Massachusetts, by George Rideout Jr., son of the foundation&#x27;s original director. Winners include California astrophysicist George F. Smoot (1993), who later won the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics, and Gerard &#x27;t Hooft (2015) who previously won the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics.

===General relativity research in the 1950s===
General relativity was introduced in the 1910s, but development of the theory was greatly slowed by a lack of suitable mathematical tools. It appeared that anti-gravity was outlawed under general relativity.

It is claimed the US Air Force also ran a study effort throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. Former Lieutenant Colonel Ansel Talbert wrote two series of newspaper articles claiming that most of the major aviation firms had started gravity control propulsion research in the 1950s. However, there is no outside confirmation of these stories, and since they take place in the midst of the policy by press release era, it is not clear how much weight these stories should be given.

It is known that there were serious efforts underway at the Glenn L. Martin Company, who formed the Research Institute for Advanced Study. Major newspapers announced the contract that had been made between theoretical physicist Burkhard Heim and the Glenn L. Martin Company. Another effort in the private sector to master understanding of gravitation was the creation of the Institute for Field Physics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1956, by Gravity Research Foundation trustee Agnew H. Bahnson.

Military support for anti-gravity projects was terminated by the Mansfield Amendment of 1973, which restricted Department of Defense spending to only the areas of scientific research with explicit military applications. The Mansfield Amendment was passed specifically to end long-running projects that had no results.

Under general relativity, gravity is the result of following spatial geometry (change in the normal shape of space) caused by local mass-energy. This theory holds that it is the altered shape of space, deformed by massive objects, that causes gravity, which is actually a property of deformed space rather than being a true force. Although the equations cannot normally produce a &quot;negative geometry&quot;, it is possible to do so by using &quot;negative mass&quot;. The same equations do not, of themselves, rule out the existence of negative mass.

Both general relativity and Newtonian gravity appear to predict that negative mass would produce a repulsive gravitational field. In particular, Sir Hermann Bondi proposed in 1957 that negative gravitational mass, combined with negative inertial mass, would comply with the strong equivalence principle of general relativity theory and the Newtonian laws of conservation of linear momentum and energy. Bondi&#x27;s proof yielded singularity-free solutions for the relativity equations. In July 1988, Robert L. Forward presented a paper at the AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE 24th Joint Propulsion Conference that proposed a Bondi negative gravitational mass propulsion system.

Bondi pointed out that a negative mass will fall toward (and not away from) &quot;normal&quot; matter, since although the gravitational force is repulsive, the negative mass (according to Newton&#x27;s law, F=ma) responds by accelerating in the opposite of the direction of the force. Normal mass, on the other hand, will fall away from the negative matter. He noted that two identical masses, one positive and one negative, placed near each other will therefore self-accelerate in the direction of the line between them, with the negative mass chasing after the positive mass. Notice that because the negative mass acquires negative kinetic energy, the total energy of the accelerating masses remains at zero. Forward pointed out that the self-acceleration effect is due to the negative inertial mass, and could be seen induced without the gravitational forces between the particles.

The Standard Model of particle physics, which describes all currently known forms of matter, does not include negative mass. Although cosmological dark matter may consist of particles outside the Standard Model whose nature is unknown, their mass is ostensibly known – since they were postulated from their gravitational effects on surrounding objects, which implies their mass is positive. The proposed cosmological dark energy, on the other hand, is more complicated, since according to general relativity the effects of both its energy density and its negative pressure contribute to its gravitational effect.

===Unique force===
Under general relativity any form of energy couples with spacetime to create the geometries that cause gravity. A longstanding question was whether or not these same equations applied to antimatter. The issue was considered solved in 1960 with the development of CPT symmetry, which demonstrated that antimatter follows the same laws of physics as &quot;normal&quot; matter, and therefore has positive energy content and also causes (and reacts to) gravity like normal matter (see gravitational interaction of antimatter).

For much of the last quarter of the 20th century, the physics community was involved in attempts to produce a unified field theory, a single physical theory that explains the four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Scientists have made progress in unifying the three quantum forces, but gravity has remained &quot;the problem&quot; in every attempt. This has not stopped any number of such attempts from being made, however.

Generally these attempts tried to &quot;quantize gravity&quot; by positing a particle, the graviton, that carried gravity in the same way that photons (light) carry electromagnetism. Simple attempts along this direction all failed, however, leading to more complex examples that attempted to account for these problems. Two of these, supersymmetry and the relativity related supergravity, both required the existence of an extremely weak &quot;fifth force&quot; carried by a graviphoton, which coupled together several &quot;loose ends&quot; in quantum field theory, in an organized manner. As a side effect, both theories also all but required that antimatter be affected by this fifth force in a way similar to anti-gravity, dictating repulsion away from mass. Several experiments were carried out in the 1990s to measure this effect, but none yielded positive results.

In 2013 CERN looked for an antigravity effect in an experiment designed to study the energy levels within antihydrogen. The antigravity measurement was just an &quot;interesting sideshow&quot; and was inconclusive.

===Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program===
During the close of the twentieth century NASA provided funding for the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program (BPP) from 1996 through 2002. This program studied a number of &quot;far out&quot; designs for space propulsion that were not receiving funding through normal university or commercial channels. Anti-gravity-like concepts were investigated under the name &quot;diametric drive&quot;. The work of the BPP program continues in the independent, non-NASA affiliated Tau Zero Foundation.

==Empirical claims and commercial efforts==
There have been a number of attempts to build anti-gravity devices, and a small number of reports of anti-gravity-like effects in the scientific literature. None of the examples that follow are accepted as reproducible examples of anti-gravity.

===Gyroscopic devices===

Gyroscopes produce a force when twisted that operates &quot;out of plane&quot; and can appear to lift themselves against gravity. Although this force is well understood to be illusory, even under Newtonian models, it has nevertheless generated numerous claims of anti-gravity devices and any number of patented devices. None of these devices has ever been demonstrated to work under controlled conditions, and they have often become the subject of conspiracy theories as a result.

Another &quot;rotating device&quot; example is shown in a series of patents granted to Henry Wallace between 1968 and 1974. His devices consist of rapidly spinning disks of brass, a material made up largely of elements with a total half-integer nuclear spin. He claimed that by rapidly rotating a disk of such material, the nuclear spin became aligned, and as a result created a &quot;gravitomagnetic&quot; field in a fashion similar to the magnetic field created by the Barnett effect. No independent testing or public demonstration of these devices is known.

In 1989, it was reported that a weight decreases along the axis of a right spinning gyroscope. A test of this claim a year later yielded null results. A recommendation was made to conduct further tests at a 1999 AIP conference.

===Thomas Townsend Brown&#x27;s gravitator===

In 1921, while still in high school, Thomas Townsend Brown found that a high-voltage Coolidge tube seemed to change mass depending on its orientation on a balance scale. Through the 1920s Brown developed this into devices that combined high voltages with materials with high dielectric constants (essentially large capacitors); he called such a device a &quot;gravitator&quot;. Brown made the claim to observers and in the media that his experiments were showing anti-gravity effects. Brown would continue his work and produced a series of high-voltage devices in the following years in attempts to sell his ideas to aircraft companies and the military. He coined the names Biefeld–Brown effect and electrogravitics in conjunction with his devices. Brown tested his asymmetrical capacitor devices in a vacuum, supposedly showing it was not a more down-to-earth electrohydrodynamic effect generated by high voltage ion flow in air.

Electrogravitics is a popular topic in ufology, anti-gravity, free energy, with government conspiracy theorists and related websites, in books and publications with claims that the technology became highly classified in the early 1960s and that it is used to power UFOs and the B-2 bomber. There is also research and videos on the internet purported to show lifter-style capacitor devices working in a vacuum, therefore not receiving propulsion from ion drift or ion wind being generated in air.

Follow-up studies on Brown&#x27;s work and other claims have been conducted by R. L. Talley in a 1990 US Air Force study, NASA scientist Jonathan Campbell in a 2003 experiment, and Martin Tajmar in a 2004 paper. They have found that no thrust could be observed in a vacuum and that Brown&#x27;s and other ion lifter devices produce thrust along their axis regardless of the direction of gravity consistent with electrohydrodynamic effects.

===Gravitoelectric coupling===
In 1992, the Russian researcher Eugene Podkletnov claimed to have discovered, whilst experimenting with superconductors, that a fast rotating superconductor reduces the gravitational effect. Many studies have attempted to reproduce Podkletnov&#x27;s experiment, always to negative results.

Douglas Torr, of the University of Alabama in Huntsville proposed how a time-dependent magnetic field could cause the spins of the lattice ions in a superconductor to generate detectable gravitomagnetic and gravitoelectric fields in a series of papers published between 1991 and 1993. In 1999, a Miss Li appeared in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, claiming to have constructed a working prototype to generate what she described as &quot;AC Gravity.&quot; No further evidence of this prototype has been offered.

Douglas Torr and Timir Datta were involved in the development of a &quot;gravity generator&quot; at the University of South Carolina. According to a leaked document from the Office of Technology Transfer at the University of South Carolina and confirmed to &quot;Wired&quot; reporter Charles Platt in 1998, the device would create a &quot;force beam&quot; in any desired direction and the university planned to patent and license this device. No further information about this university research project or the &quot;Gravity Generator&quot; device was ever made public.

== Göde Award ==
The Institute for Gravity Research of the Göde Scientific Foundation has tried to reproduce many of the different experiments which claim any &quot;anti-gravity&quot; effects. All attempts by this group to observe an anti-gravity effect by reproducing past experiments have been unsuccessful thus far. The foundation has offered a reward of one million euros for a reproducible anti-gravity experiment.

== In fiction ==
The existence of anti-gravity is a common theme in science fiction. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; lists Francis Godwin&#x27;s posthumously-published 1638 novel &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot;, where a &quot;semi-magical&quot; stone has the power to make gravity stronger or weaker, as the earliest variation of the theme. The first story to use anti-gravity for the purpose of space travel, as well as the first to treat the subject from a scientific rather than supernatural angle, was George Tucker&#x27;s 1827 novel &quot;A Voyage to the Moon&quot;.

=== Apergy ===
Apergy is a term for a fictitious form of anti-gravitational energy first used by Percy Greg in his 1880 sword and planet novel &quot;Across the Zodiac&quot;. The term was later adopted by other fiction authors such as John Jacob Astor IV in his 1894 science fiction novel &quot;A Journey in Other Worlds&quot;, and it also appeared outside of explicit fiction writing.

<text>Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) was a West German aerospace manufacturer. It was formed during the late 1960s as the result of efforts to consolidate the West German aerospace industry; aircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt AG merged with the civil engineering and aviation firm Bölkow in 1968, while rival aircraft manufacturer Hamburger Flugzeugbau was acquired by the company in the following year.

The company was responsible for the development and manufacture of various aircraft during its existence. Among its best-known products were the MBB Bo 105 light twin-engine helicopter and its enlarged derivative, the MBB/Kawasaki BK 117. MBB was also a key early partner on the Airbus A300, a wide-body twin-jet airliner; the company&#x27;s involvement in the A300&#x27;s development and production led to it forming a key component of the multinational Airbus consortium. It was also involved in numerous experimental aircraft programmes, such as the MBB Lampyridae, an aborted stealth aircraft.

The ownership and assets of MBB changed drastically throughout its roughly two decades of existence. The company was bought by Deutsche Aerospace AG (DASA) in 1989; following several mergers and restructures, the assets of what was MBB presently form a part of Airbus.

==History==

On 6 June 1968, Messerschmitt AG merged with the small civil engineering and civil aviation firm Bölkow, becoming Messerschmitt-Bölkow. The following May, the firm acquired Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB), which had originated as a branch of Blohm+Voss. To reflect the latter&#x27;s acquisition, the company changed its name to &quot;Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm&quot; (MBB). Upon its formation, 51% of the shares in MBB was owned by the Blohm family, Willy Messerschmitt and Ludwig Bölkow; 22.07% was owned by the German State of Hamburg, 17.05% by the state of Bavaria, 7.16% by Thyssen AG, 7.16% by Siemens AG, 7.13% by Allianz Versicherungs-AG, 7.13% by Robert Bosch GmbH and 6.15% by Friedrich Krupp GmbH.

Perhaps the most successful product produced primarily by MBB was the Bo 105 helicopter. This rotorcraft, the design of which was headed by German engineer Ludwig Bölkow, made use of a revolutionary hingeless main rotor composed of fibreglass. On 13 October 1970, the German Civil Aviation Authority certified the Bo 105; initial deliveries for the first customers, ADAC Air Rescue and the Bavarian State Police, took place shortly thereafter. During 1972, an improved version of the rotorcraft with more powerful engines, the Bo 105C, was developed, this model quickly superseded the Bo 105A. Following its introduction to service in 1970, the Bo 105 quickly proved to be a commercial success. Production continued until 2001; by the end of production, 1,406 rotorcraft had been manufactured and delivered to operators in 55 nations worldwide. It served as the basis for several derivatives, such as the MBB/Kawasaki BK 117.

Having established a reputation for reliability and safety, MBB, along with one of its major shareholders, Boeing Vertol, began studying options during the 1970s for producing an enlarged version to accompany the Bo 105. However, Boeing withdrew from the venture, leading to MBB search for another partner; this was found in the form of Japanese company Kawasaki Heavy Industries. On 25 February 1977, MBB and Kawasaki signed an agreement to cooperate on the development of a new rotorcraft. Under the terms of this agreement, the two corporations merged their previously separate projects to produce twin-engined general purpose helicopters, these being the &quot;Bo 107&quot; by MBB and the &quot;KH-7&quot; from Kawasaki. Separate elements were assigned to each company; MBB were responsible for developing the rotors (these were based on the rigid rotor system previously used on MBB&#x27;s Bo 105), tailboom, flight controls and hydraulic system while Kawasaki undertook the development of the landing gear, airframe, main transmission, electrical system and other minor components. Each company established its own final assembly line for the type, on which they produced the rotorcraft to meet demands within their respective local markets.

An even more advanced derivative of the Bo 105, initially designated by MBB as the &quot;Bo 108&quot; began development during the 1970s. The company developed it in partnership with France&#x27;s Aérospatiale; the Bo 108 was originally intended to be a technology demonstrator, combining attributes of the successful Bo 105 with new advances and an aerodynamically streamlined design. Technologies included the first full-authority digital engine controls (FADEC) on a helicopter, a hingeless main rotor, and the adoption of a new transmission. First flown on 17 October 1988, a production version was introduced as the Eurocopter EC135 during the early 1990s which, like its Bo 105 ancestor, achieved similar commercial success.
Perhaps the most important partnership that MBB was involved in was the Airbus A300. On 26 September 1967, the British, French, and West German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding to start development of the A300. At this point, the A300 was only the second major joint aircraft programme in Europe, the first being the Anglo-French Concorde. Under the terms of the memorandum, Britain and France were each to receive a 37.5 per cent work share on the project, while Germany received a 25 per cent share. France&#x27;s Sud Aviation was recognized as the lead company for A300, while Hawker Siddeley was selected as the British partner company. On 29 May 1969, during the Paris Air Show, French transport minister Jean Chamant and German economics minister Karl Schiller signed an agreement officially launching the Airbus A300, the world&#x27;s first twin-engine widebody airliner. The project intended to produce an aircraft that was smaller, lighter, and more economical than its three-engine American rivals, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar.

Shortly after the Paris Air Show agreement, it was decided that, to provide effective management of responsibilities, a Groupement d&#x27;intérêt économique would be established, allowing the various partners to work together on the project while remaining separate business entities; this would be the origins of the Airbus Group. On 18 December 1970, Airbus Industrie was formally established following an agreement between Aérospatiale (the newly merged Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation) of France and the antecedents to Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, each receiving a 50 per cent stake in the newly formed company. On 15 March 1974, type certificates were granted for the A300 from both German and French authorities, clearing the way for its entry into revenue service. Ten years after the official launch of the A300, the company had achieved a 26 per cent market share in terms of dollar value, enabling Airbus Industries to proceed with the development of its second aircraft, the Airbus A310.

During 1981, MBB acquired rival company Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW), which itself had been formed via the merger of the aircraft manufacturers Focke-Wulf, Focke-Achgelis, and Weserflug. During the following year, MBB acquired the astronautics company Entwicklungsring Nord (ERNO; to reflect this change, the company was rebranded as &quot;MBB-ERNO&quot;. In 1989, MBB was taken over by Deutsche Aerospace AG (DASA), which was renamed &quot;Daimler-Benz Aerospace&quot; in 1995. Following the 1998 merger of the German industrial group Daimler Benz and the American company Chrysler Corporation, the aerospace division was renamed DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG on 7 November 1998. As part of the prevailing trend of European defense consolidation of the late 1990s saw DASA being merged with Aerospatiale-Matra of France and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) of Spain to form the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) during 2000. The former assets of the DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, for the most part, presently operate as &quot;Airbus Germany&quot;.

<doc id="342137" wikidata="Q18434" url="?curid=342137" title="Léon Blum">
<text>André Léon Blum (; 9 April 1872 – 30 March 1950) was a French socialist politician and three-time Prime Minister of France. As a Jew, he was heavily influenced by the Dreyfus affair of the late 19th century. He was a disciple of socialist leader Jean Jaurès. After Jaurès&#x27; assassination in 1914, he became his successor.

Despite Blum&#x27;s relatively short tenures, his time in office was very influential. As Prime Minister in the left-wing Popular Front government in 1936–1937, he provided a series of major economic and social reforms. Blum declared neutrality in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) to avoid the civil conflict spilling over into France itself. Once out of office in 1938, he denounced the appeasement of Germany.

When Germany defeated France in 1940, Blum became a staunch opponent of Vichy France. Tried (but never judged) by the Vichy government on charges of treason, he was imprisoned in the Buchenwald concentration camp. After the war, he resumed a transitional leadership role in French politics, helping to bring about the French Fourth Republic, until his death in 1950.

==Early life==

Blum was born in 1872 in Paris to a moderately prosperous, middle class, assimilated Jewish family in the mercantile business. His father Abraham, a merchant, was born in Alsace and moved to Paris in 1848. Blum&#x27;s mother, Adèle-Marie-Alice Picart was born in Paris, but her family likewise originated in Alsace. Blum&#x27;s mother observed Orthodox rituals faithfully, but his father was less religious, being only seen in the synagogue on the high holy days. Blum came from a family that very much identified with the republic, and as a child he attended the public funeral services of defenders of French republican values such as Léon Gambetta in 1882 and Victor Hugo in 1885. He came to identify with the universalism of French republicanism, which portrayed France as an especially enlightened nation that was leading the rest of the world in the right direction, and where French civilization was open to all who were willing to embrace the French language and culture regardless of religion, ethnicity, and race. Blum himself was not especially religious, but was always very proud to be Jewish and frequently affirmed his Jewish identity when subjected to anti-Semitic insults. Blum was more influenced by the rationalistic and anticlerical ideas of the French Enlightenment than by Judaism. Blum always saw himself as both French and Jewish, and he took a special pride in the heritage of the French Revolution, which for him marked the beginning of a civic and secular society in which religion did not matter. He wrote that as a Jew he belonged &quot;to a race which owed to the French Revolution human liberty and equality, something that could never be forgotten&quot;.

Blum first attended the Lycée Charlemagne, but was so successful academically that he was transferred over to the Lycée Henri-IV, the favored school of the elite. Blum entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1890 and excelled there, but he dropped out a year later, entering instead the Faculty of Law. He attended the University of Paris and became both a lawyer and literary critic. Starting in 1892, he became the critic for &quot;La Revue Blanche&quot; magazine, where he reviewed works by Anatole France, Pierre Louÿs, Jules Renard and André Gide. His reviews made him famous in Parisian intellectual circles, where he became known as a reviewer with interesting and provocative views about the state of modern French literature. He also contributed poetry to the magazines &quot;La Conque&quot; and &quot;Le Banquet&quot;. Blum was greatly influenced by Stendhal whose novels he loved, and he was to become one of the world&#x27;s leading experts on Stendhal whom he often wrote about. As a young man, he effected the style of an aesthete &quot;dandy&quot; and was an associate of the writer Marcel Proust. Proust did not have much respect for Blum as a writer, whom he dismissed as &quot;mediocre&quot;. Blum was usually dressed as a dandy in the salons of Paris, wearing an expensive suit, top hat, gloves and a monocle. His way of dressing led to the young Blum often being denounced as a homosexual, with the poet Charles Maurras calling Blum &quot;the maiden&quot; in one of his poems. Throughout his life, Blum was always subjected to accusations that he was gay, but it appears that the effeminate style that he fancied in his youth was more of an act of youthful rebellion.

Blum described himself as &quot;a vulnerable and fragile being, &#x27;like a girl in a novel&#x27;, an overtly delicate plant&quot;. To rebut the charge that he was too &quot;soft&quot; and a homosexual, Blum sought to prove his &quot;strength&quot; by engaging in duels with rivals. In 1896, Blum married Lise Bloch at the Grand Synagogue of Paris. He was initially convinced of the guilt of Captain Alfred Dreyfus who had been convicted of treason for Germany in 1894, but in the late summer of 1897 Lucien Herr convinced Blum that Dreyfus was innocent and as an intellectual with influence he had the duty to take a stand in favor of Dreyfus. Starting in September 1897, Blum became deeply involved in the Dreyfus Affair, where he resolved to &quot;restore the innocent man&#x27;s good name&quot;. Blum was in contact with Georges Clemenceau, who served as the lawyer for the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot; and Fernand Labori, who served as the lawyer for Émile Zola, writing legal briefs for both Clemenceau and Labori. Blum attended the trial in 1898 of Zola for his letter &quot;J&#x27;Accuse...!&quot; published in &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot;. Blum tried to recruit Maurice Barrès, whom he called &quot;my guide&quot; and &quot;my teacher&quot; to French literature to the Dreyfusard cause, and was greatly hurt when Barrè told him he was an anti-Dreyfusard. Blum described himself as &quot;almost in mourning&quot; when Barrès rejected his appeal, and instead wrote the article &quot;The Protest of the Intellectuals&quot; condemning the &quot;Jewish signers&quot; who championed the cause of Dreyfus. The Dreyfus Affair marked the beginning of Blum&#x27;s interest in socialism, which promoted internationalism and secularism. Blum became convinced that antisemitism was largely the work of the Catholic Church and the upper classes, and socialism in France would end antisemitism forever. Despite all of the passions created by the Dreyfus Affair, in 1899 he wrote he had no fears of &quot;a Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Day of the Jews&quot;, writing that pogroms were possible &quot;in Poland, Galicia, or Romania or maybe in Algiers, but not in France&quot;.

Between 1905 and 1907 he wrote &quot;Du Mariage&quot; a highly controversial (for the period) and much talked about critical essay about the problems with traditional marriage as envisioned in the late 19th century, with its religious and economic background and strong stress on women remaining virgins until their marriage day. Blum stated that both men and women should enjoy a period of &quot;polygamic&quot; free sex life in order to experience a more mature and stable relationship during later married life: “For both men and women, the life of adventure must precede the life of marriage, the life of instinct must precede the life of reason” 

Unsurprisingly he was targeted by the then-powerful Catholic Church in France, in the wake of the turmoil caused by the separation between church and state implemented by Emile Combes in 1905. Far right and royalist politicians and agitators, and most preeminently Charles Maurras, were incensed, and pelted mostly anti-semitic insults and public outrage at Blum, famously dubbing him &quot;le pornographe du Conseil d&#x27;état&quot; as Blum was by then a counsellor of this institution. Although Blum&#x27;s views are nowadays accepted and mostly mainstream in many developed countries, the book remained an object of scandal long after WWI and the shift to the emancipation of women. On 14 October 1912, Blum fought a duel with swords with a rival theater critic Pierre Weber, which ended with Weber surrendering after Blum wounded him.

==Entry into politics==
While in his youth an avid reader of the works of the nationalist writer Maurice Barrès, Blum had shown little interest in politics until the Dreyfus Affair of 1894, which had a traumatic effect on him as it did on many French Jews. Blum first became personally involved in the Affair when he aided the defense case of Émile Zola in 1898 as a jurist, before which he had not demonstrated interest in public affairs. Campaigning as a Dreyfusard brought him into contact with the socialist leader Jean Jaurès, whom he greatly admired. He began contributing to the socialist daily, &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;, and joined the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (, SFIO). Soon he was the party&#x27;s main theoretician. It is possible that Blum&#x27;s interest in politics began somewhat earlier, as Fernand Gregh mentioned in his personal memoirs that Blum had expressed interest in politics as early as 1892.

In July 1914, just as the First World War broke out, Jaurès was assassinated, and Blum became more active in the Socialist party leadership. Before the war, Blum had supported the plans of Jaurès for a general strike to prevent a war, but in August 1914 he supported the war under the grounds that France was faced with German aggression. Blum in general favored a pacifistic position, but he also believed that France had the right and duty to defend itself against aggression, which he viewed as the case when Germany presented an ultimatum whose terms were designed to be rejected, followed up by an invasion of neutral Belgium as the best way to invade France. Blum did not feel that he was betraying Jaurès&#x27;s vision as he believed Jaurès would have rallied to the support of the war after Germany invaded France on 2 August 1914. He supported the &quot;Union Sacrée&quot; (&quot;Sacred Union&quot;) coalition government formed to resist the German aggression. Blum was exempt from military service because he was near-sighted and 42 years old, but he was described as being full of &quot;ardent patriotism&quot; as he sought to do everything within his power to assist with the war effort. In August 1914 Blum became assistant to the Socialist Minister of Public Works Marcel Sembat. In 1915, when a minority of the Socialists started to become opposed to the war, Blum displayed much tact in seeking party unity as he maintained that the German threat necessitated support for the war. He disapproved of the French Socialists who attended the Zimmerwald Conference in September 1915 to seek an end to the war. The majority of the Socialists who attended the Zimmerwald conference were Russian, and Blum was struck by the extent of alienation that the Russian socialists expressed towards their country as Russian nationalism had utterly no appeal to them in the same way that French nationalism appealed to him. Blum was a lifelong Anglophile who greatly appreciated Britain&#x27;s role in helping to defend France and admired the British Westminster system. Blum felt that the system of government under the &quot;Troisième République&quot; where the premier was more of a chairman of a cumbersome committee than an executive leader was inefficient, and he advocated France adopting a republican version of the Westminster system with a strong executive prime minister.

In April 1917, he welcomed the entry of the United States into the war, which he portrayed as a struggle between militaristic monarchy of Germany vs. the democratic French republic. On 8 April 1917, Blum wrote in an editorial in &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; that: &quot;Our victory will be the emancipation and reconciliation of men through Liberty and Justice&quot;. In the same editorial, he praised the call of the U.S. president Woodrow Wilson for &quot;peace without victory&quot;, writing that the problem was not the German people, but rather Germany&#x27;s leaders such as the Emperor Wilhelm II. By 1917, the Socialists had divided into an antiwar group led by Paul Faure and Jean Longuet vs. a &quot;national defense&quot; group led by Albert Thomas and Pierre Renaudel. Thomas and Renaudel represented a moderate, reformist, and definitely French strain of socialism while Faure and Longuet represented a more militant, pacifistic and internationalist strain of socialism that became increasing opposed to the war as it dragged on. Blum became the leader of a &quot;centrist&quot; group in the Socialist Party that supported the war like the &quot;national defense&quot; group, but in many ways were more ideologically closer to the antiwar group. Blum was strongly opposed to Vladimir Lenin who called for the defeat of Russia as the best way to bring about a Communist revolution, and in November 1917 he condemned the Bolshevik coup in Petrograd. The evolution of the more left-wing French Socialists from supporting the war in 1914 to opposing it by 1918 was also reflected in Russia. In 1914, most Russian socialists had either declared their support for war or least their neutrality as many socialists could not bring themselves to supporting Emperor Nicholas II; by 1917 the radical views of Lenin who called for Russia&#x27;s defeat were in the mainstream of Russian socialism. The anti-war group in the French Socialist Party followed a similar trajectory to what happened in Russia. Blum wrote he was disgusted by the &quot;intransigent fanaticism&quot; of the Bolsheviks along with their cruelty and their &quot;mystical belief in the sole immediate virtue of revolution in itself, no matter what the conditions, the circumstances, the means employed&quot;. However, he charged that Thomas and Renaudel had become too moderate and had diluted their socialism. In November 1917, Blum supported the Balfour Declaration promising a &quot;Jewish national home&quot; in Palestine if the Allies won the war. However, Blum saw Zionism as a solution to the problems of the Jewish communities in Eastern Europe, not of France. Blum always saw himself as a Frenchman and wrote about he had no intention of ever going to Palestine as he was &quot;a French Jew, of a long line of French ancestors, speaking only the language of his country, nurtured predominantly on its culture&quot;.

In March 1918, Germany launched Operation Michael, an offensive intended to win the war. As the German Army advanced within 50 miles of Paris in the spring of 1918, Blum called for a &quot;Jacobin&quot; defense of Paris with every citizen to be handed a gun. On 19 August 1918, Blum wrote in &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; that the choice &quot;between Wilson and Lenin, between democracy and Bolshevik fanaticism&quot; was a false one as &quot;I chose neither Wilson nor Lenin. I chose Jaurès&quot;. In a bitterly divided Socialist Party, Blum&#x27;s &quot;centrist&quot; faction had an oversized importance despite being outnumbered by the two other factions, which along with Blum&#x27;s reputation as a protégé of Jaurès made him into one of the leaders of the Socialist Party by the end of the war. In 1914, almost all Socialists had supported the &quot;union sacrée&quot; as Blum had done, but as the war continued, many Socialists felt the burden of the war had not been shared equally with the working class making all the sacrifices while the bourgeoise made no such sacrifices. Renaudel and Thomas had discredited themselves by serving as ministers in the &quot;union sacrée&quot; government who had fought against strikes to maximize war production with many Socialists such as Longuet and Faure charging Renaudel and Thomas had failed to achieve concessions to the workers in exchange for no strikes. By late 1918, the more left-wing antiwar group in the Socialist Party was in the ascendency and many of the younger members of the party expressed much admiration for Lenin and the Bolsheviks, who had done what the Socialists only merely talked about. By July 1918, the antiwar group had come close to taking control of the Socialist Party executive. In an attempt to hold the Socialist Party together, Blum tried to paper over the chasm between the pro-war socialists vs. the anti-war socialists by writing on 19 August 1918 that the Socialists were &quot;republicans and socialists, socialists and French patriots, French patriots and champions of working-class internationalism&quot;. Only the victory of the Allies with Germany surrendering on 11 November 1918 prevented the Socialist Party from breaking up with Blum attempting to reconcile the two factions after the war. Blum worked hard at rebuilding Socialist Party unity, but the wounds left by the split between the antiwar and prowar Socialists was too deep and visceral, and set the stage for most of the antiwar Socialists breaking off to found the French Communist Party in 1920. In the two years that followed 1918, Blum&#x27;s reputation as the leader of a &quot;centrist&quot; group who might be able to hold the Socialists together raised his profile immensely. In an editorial in &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; on 19 July 1919, Blum attacked the Treaty of Versailles, which he called &quot;a denial, a betrayal&quot; of the Allied principles held during the war. Blum opposed French intervention in the Russian Civil War, but was cautious about calls from the more radical Socialists to affiliate with the Comintern that had been founded in Moscow in 1919.

In 1919 he was chosen as chair of the party&#x27;s executive committee, and was also elected to the National Assembly as a representative of Paris. In the election of November 1919, the center-right coalition &quot;bloc national&quot; won the majority of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies while the Socialists went from holding 103 seats down to 68. Many of the wartime Socialist leaders such as Renaudel, Faure, and Longuet lost their seats while Blum was elected, giving him a greater prominence. Blum&#x27;s maiden speech on 30 December 1919 gave him a reputation as one of the finest speakers in the National Assembly. In the fall of 1920, Grigory Zinoviev, the chief of the Comintern, in an open letter to &quot;all French Socialists and proletarians&quot; denounced in the most violent terms the leaders of the French Socialists for supporting World War One and demanded &quot;21 conditions&quot; for affiliation with the Comintern. Zinoviev demanded that the French Socialists reorganize along Leninist lines, merge the trade unions into the Socialist Party instead of being merely allied to them, expel all reformist Socialists and accept the guidance of the Comintern in all matters. At the time, the Bolsheviks had tremendous prestige in left-wing circles as the first Communist government in the world and most of the more radical Socialists supported accepting Zinoviev&#x27;s &quot;21 conditions&quot;. Believing that there was no such thing as a &quot;good dictatorship&quot;, Blum opposed participation in the Comintern and fought hard against accepting Zinoviev&#x27;s terms, writing that the Bolsheviks was too extreme in their beliefs and methods. Therefore, in 1920, he worked to prevent a split between supporters and opponents of the Russian Revolution at the Congress of Tours, but the radicals seceded, taking &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; with them, and formed the French Section of the Communist International (SFIC). Throughout the 1920s, Blum saw the French Communists as his main rivals, and hence often took a rhetorical stance that made him sound more extreme left-wing than what he really was in an attempt to keep Socialist voters from defecting over to the Communists.

==Socialist leader==
Blum led the SFIO through the 1920s and 1930s, and was also editor of the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Le Populaire&quot;. Blum was always very neatly in his suit together with his pince-nez glasses which made an unlikely leader of a party meant to represent the working class. However, Blum had loyally supported the war effort in the First World War, but had not held a ministerial rank like Thomas and Renaudel had. Blum won respect for his courage in standing up to Communist heckling and threats of violence at Socialist rallies, and was famed for being able to &quot;work magic with words&quot;. On 6 April 1921, Blum launched &quot;Le Populaire&quot; newspaper to replace &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; with himself as the editor.

In a 1922 speech, Blum expressed his disagreement with Communism, saying the Bolshevik regime in Russia was not a &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;, but rather a &quot;dictatorship over the proletariat&quot;. In the same speech, he called for a socialism that &quot;will improve the condition of women, children, emotional life and family life&quot;. Central to his critique of Bolshevism was his criticism that &quot;cruelty&quot; was the essence of the Communist regime in Soviet Russia, which he contrasted with the &quot;humanism&quot; that he saw as the essence of socialism. In May 1924, Blum had the Socialists join the centre-left &quot;cartel des gauchers&quot; alliance that won the subsequent elections with the Socialists going from 55 seats to 104 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. On 31 May 1924, Édouard Herriot, the leader of the Radical Socialist Party, asked for Blum to join the government he was forming, a request that was refused with Blum merely promising that the Socialists would support Herriot&#x27;s government in the Chamber. Blum feared that entering the cabinet would cause the Socialists to lose votes to the Communists since inevitably the Socialists would have to compromise on some of their principles in office. Despite not entering the cabinet, French newspapers portrayed France as governed by &quot;a republic of professors&quot; that consisted of a triumvirate of intellectuals, namely Herriot, Blum and Paul Painlevé, the leader of the Socialist Republicans. Blum supported the Herriot government in forcing the resignation of President Alexandre Millerand, and the government&#x27;s anti-clerical bills designed to weaken the influence of the Catholic Church over French life. In foreign policy, Blum supported the Herriot government&#x27;s conciliatory policy towards Germany and he voted for the Treaty of Locarno in 1925. Blum also declared himself a supporter of the League of Nations, and favored establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Blum wanted the Herriot government to bring in taxes on capital and a consolidation of Treasury bonds to assist with paying off France&#x27;s massive war debts to Britain and the United States, measures that Herriot was opposed to. On 25 March 1925, Blum wrote to Herriot urging him to impose the taxes and &quot;to break with all delays, vain hopes, half hopes, half measures&quot;. Herriot&#x27;s attempt to bring in the tax increases that Blum wanted caused the downfall of his government on 11 April 1925, which was defeated in the Senate when a number of Radical senators voted with the conservatives against the tax increases, a blow that the &quot;cartel des gauchers&quot; never really recovered from. Despite being a member of the &quot;cartel des gauchers&quot;, Blum had the Socialists vote against a number of government bills in the Chamber that would have involved cutting the salaries and pensions of civil servants to assist with paying off the war debts, which caused much tension with his allies in the Radical Party. In the 1928 election, the conservatives were victorious and Blum lost his seat in Paris to the Communist Jacques Duclos. Blum was returned to the Chamber of Deputies in a by-election in May 1929.

In 1929, Blum along with Albert Einstein attended the founding of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem, where both Blum and Einstein spoke in favor of Zionism. In October 1929, Édouard Daladier, the leader of the left-wing of the Radical Party invited Blum and the Socialists to join his government, an offer Blum refused under the grounds that it would mean compromising his principles and would drive Socialist voters into the arms of the Communists. At a Socialist Party congress in January 1930, Marcel Déat gave a strong speech in favor of taking up Daladier&#x27;s offer, but Blum&#x27;s speech in favor of rejecting Daladier&#x27;s offer carried the congress with 2, 066 delegates voting against joining the cabinet and 1, 057 voting for. In the 1932 election fought under the shadow of the Great Depression, the Radicals and the Socialists made gains, and Blum once again promised to support a government headed by Herriot, through he would not enter the cabinet as usual by proposing a set of demands for cabinet participation that he knew were too left-wing for Herriot to accept. In Foreign policy, Blum&#x27;s main theme was the need to strengthen the League of Nations along with a fervent support for disarmament. Blum consistently argued that the millions of francs spent on defense was wasteful, and the francs would be better used in social programs to alleviate the Great Depression.

In December 1932, Blum and the Socialists broke with Herriot when he insisted on continuing to pay war debts to the United States, and he voted to default on the war debts on 15 December 1932, which thereby brought down Herriot&#x27;s government. Blum privately admitted that defaulting on the war debts was unwise, but he argued in the face of the Great Depression, most French people did not understand why France was giving the first priority to repaying wealthy Wall Street investors instead of helping the millions left destitute by the Depression. In January 1933, Blum and the Socialists brought down the Radical government of Joseph Paul-Boncour when he proposed cuts to the salaries of civil servants to help deal with the economic crisis caused by the Great Depression. By this stage, Blum had acquired the unenviable reputation as someone who refused to take the responsibility of power, who acted in a purely negative and irresponsible fashion by bringing down Radical governments without being prepared to propose constructive ideas and solutions. The appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 did not at first change Blum&#x27;s views about defense spending as he remained resolutely opposed to military spending. Blum had always felt that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh towards Germany, and the best way to deal with Hitler was to disarm France down to the same level as the Treaty of Versailles had disarmed Germany, which he believed would end any threat from the Third Reich. For a considerable period of time, Blum believed revising the Treaty of Versailles in favor of Germany was the best and most reasonable way of dealing with Hitler. Blum put great hopes in the World Disarmament Conference held in Geneva between 1932 and 1934, and tended to cast the French government as the villain with for its warnings that German rearmament would mean another world war. Blum&#x27;s favored formula was &quot;la paix désarméé&quot; (&quot;peace and disarmament&quot;) and &quot;security through arbitration and disarmament&quot;. Alongside these beliefs was an intense opposition to &quot;French militarism&quot; as Blum had a marked distrust of the French Army generals whose politics tended towards the right, and he believed warnings about Germany were merely scaremongering to increase the military budget at the expense of social spending. Renaudel criticized Blum under the grounds the &quot;spread of fascism in Europe&quot; required the Socialists to vote for military credits.

In 1933, Blum came into conflict with Renaudel who kept pressing for the Socialists to enter the cabinet in alliance with the Radicals under the grounds that some power was better than none, and who charged that Blum was an ineffectual leader more concerned about keeping his principles pure than with achieving anything. Blum was also opposed to a neo-Socialist group led by Déat and Adrien Marquet who wanted a more nationalistic and authoritarian socialism as both Déat and Marquet charged that democracy had failed in the face of the Depression, and a dictatorship was needed. At Socialist Party congresses in April and July 1933 Blum and Faure accused Renaudel of wanting to &quot;remain in tow&quot; behind the Radicals, and charged that Renaudel had betrayed party principles by calling for increased military spending. At a Socialist Party congress in July 1933, Blum had the neo-Socialist fraction censured for advocating a dictatorship, saying he was for democracy. In October 1933, Daladier who was once again serving as premier, brought in a bill to cut pensions and salaries of civil servants, which Blum had the Socialists voted against, causing the downfall of Daladier&#x27;s government. The debate about whatever to support Daladier led to Renaudel being expelled as Renaudel had argued for support for Daladier, who had also advocated increased military spending in the face of Hitler, which Renaudel stated was the most important issue. The same party congress that saw Renaudel expelled also saw the expulsion of Deat and his neo-Socialist faction, which costed the Socialists 28 Deputies and 7 Senators.

Blum was greatly shaken by the Stavisky affair in early 1934 along with the riots by royalists and fascists that pushed France to a state that seemed to many to being very close to civil war. The Stavisky affair forced the resignation of the premier Camille Chautemps on 30 January 1934 and led to Daladier forming another government. Blum saw the riot of 6 February 1934 in the Place de la Concorde when a group of royalists and fascists attempted to storm the National Assembly as an act of insurrection against the republic, and argued that the main danger facing France was fascism. He always saw the riot of 6 February as a fascist coup attempt. Blum approached Daladier on 7 February 1934 to talk about an alliance between the Radicals and the Socialists against the fascists who had rioted the night before, saying that French democracy was in peril, which marked the beginning of what became the Popular Front. After the Stavisky riots caused the downfall of Daladier&#x27;s government, a new government was formed by Gaston Doumergue, which Blum refused to join when Doumergue offered him a seat in the cabinet. Blum charged that most of the figures in Domergue&#x27;s government were associated with either the centre-right such as Herriot or the right such as Louis Barthou, André Tardieu, and Marshal Philippe Pétain, saying he would be powerless in such a cabinet. When the Foreign Minister Louis Barthou issued the Barthou note on 17 April 1934 that accused Hitler of dealing in bad faith for Germany&#x27;s return to the World Disarmament Conference and stated that France would look after its own security, Blum came out in opposition to the Barthou note, which he accused of a starting a new arms race.

Herriot continued to take part in the right-learning coalition governments that followed the riot of 6 February 1934 while being opposed by the left-leaning &quot;young Radicals&quot; such as Pierre Cot and Jean Zay who wanted an alliance with the Socialists and Communists. Daladier, the long-time rival of Herriot, quietly encouraged the &quot;young Radicals&quot;, as a way to undermine his leadership. In the spring of 1934, the Comintern changed its policy, and on 31 May 1934 an article appeared in &quot;Pravda&quot; that was reprinted in &quot;&quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; the same day that stated that Communists should work with Socialists against fascists. In June 1934, the Communists suggested to Blum that the Socialists and Communists hold a joint demonstration against Nazi Germany. Blum was weary of the Communist offer, but many of the younger Socialists were not, and Blum found himself being driven forward by younger Socialist activists who held a joint anti-Nazi demonstration on 2 July 1934 with the Communists without seeking Blum&#x27;s approval. In an editorial in &quot;Le Populaire&quot; on 10 July 1934, Blum stated he was willing to work with the Communists against fascism, but he would not be a &quot;dupe&quot; of the Communists, whom Blum had a deep distrust of. On 27 July 1934, Blum signed a pact with the Communists for an anti-fascist platform. The pressure for a Popular Front came more from the Communist leader Maurice Thorez who following the new line from the Comintern called in October 1934 for &quot;a Popular Front of work, liberty and peace&quot; while Blum played a more passive role. Blum did not trust Thorez, and was weary of his offers for an alliance. Faure, still an influential figure in the Socialist Party, charged that new anti-fascist line from the Comintern was all part of a devious scheme by Joseph Stalin to start another world war to bring to power Communist regimes everywhere. The opposition from Faure and his followers to an alliance with the Communists imposed constraints on Blum&#x27;s ability to form an alliance with them.

In May 1935, the French Premier Pierre Laval signed an alliance with Stalin in Moscow, and the Comintern ordered the French Communists to support increased defense spending in France, which left Blum in the odd position of criticizing the Communists for wanting more defense spending. Blum voted for the Franco-Soviet alliance under the grounds it was &quot;not to make war, but to prevent it&quot;. He took the contradictory line of supporting disarmament as the best way to achieve peace while also stating he was opposed to aggression from the fascist states. In 1935 Blum voted against extending compulsory military service from 1 year to 2 years, saying he wanted France &quot;to disarm on its own as much as is necessary in order to encourage an international agreement&quot;. The same year, the Democratic Republican politician, Paul Reynaud, and his acolyte, Charles de Gaulle, championed a plan for an elite corps of armored divisions, which Blum voted against under the grounds it would be a &quot;praetorian guard&quot; that would meddle in politics. At the same time, Blum and the other Socialists were voting in unison with the &quot;young Radicals&quot; in the Chamber of Deputies against the deflationary policy of the Laval government, which formed the basis of an alliance. The Popular Front was founded on Bastille Day 1935 with Blum, Édouard Daladier of the Radicals and Maurice Thorez of the Communists marching from the Place de la Bastille to the Place de la Nation in Paris alongside thousands of their followers carrying &quot;tricolores&quot; and red flags while singing &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;. The speeches given that day emphasized that fascism would never be allowed to come to power in France, that what had happened in Italy and Germany would be opposed to the utmost in France.

During the Ethiopian crisis, Blum supported the League of Nations and he harshly criticised Benito Mussolini for his invasion of Ethiopia launched on 3 October 1935. Blum was very critical of Laval&#x27;s foreign policy for seeking an alliance with Italy, which led to Laval being opposed to the League of Nations imposing oil sanctions on Italy. As a permanent veto-holding member of the League Council (the executive council of the League), the threat of a French veto led to the sanctions that were imposed on Italy being watered down, and oil (which Italy lacked) was never included in the sanctions lists of material forbidden to Italy. Blum was strongly against the Hoare–Laval Pact in December 1935 that essentially rewarded Mussolini for invading Ethiopia, and his speeches in the Chamber helped to bring down Laval&#x27;s government, something that Laval never forgave him for. The failure of the League of Nations sanctions against Italy marked the beginning of a change in Blum&#x27;s views about rearmament as he forced to concede that sanctions did not always work, and in face of aggression military force was justified as a means of self-defense.

== Popular Front government of 1936–1940 ==
Blum was elected as Deputy for Narbonne in 1929, and was re-elected in 1932 and 1936. In 1933, he expelled Marcel Déat, Pierre Renaudel, and other neosocialists from the SFIO. Political circumstances changed in 1934, when the rise of German dictator Adolf Hitler and fascist riots in Paris caused Stalin and the French Communists to change their policy. In 1935 all the parties of left and centre formed the Popular Front. France had not successfully recovered from the worldwide economic depression, wages had fallen and the working class demanded reforms. The Popular Front won a sweeping victory in June 1936. The Popular Front won a solid majority with 386 seats out of 608. For the first time, the Socialists won more seats than the Radicals; they formed an effective coalition. As Socialist leader Blum became Prime Minister of France and the first socialist to hold that office, he formed a cabinet that included 20 Socialists, 13 Radicals and two Socialist Republicans. The Communists won 15 percent of the vote, and 12 percent of the seats. They supported the government, although they refused to take any cabinet positions. For the first time, the cabinet included three women in minor roles, even though women were not able to vote. Blum had long been accused by his critics within the Socialist Party of avoiding the responsibility of power as he was accursed of wanting to be the leader of a perpetual opposition party rather compromise his principles, leading Blum to give a speech that he had decided to embrace the responsibility of office to achieve the social change he had long promised.

===Labour policies===
The election of the left-wing government brought a wave of strikes, involving two million workers, and the seizure of many factories. The strikes were spontaneous and unorganised, but nevertheless the business community panicked and met secretly with Blum, who negotiated a series of reforms, and then gave labour unions the credit for the Matignon Accords. The new laws:
* gave workers the right to strike
* initiated collective bargaining
* legislated the mandating of 12 days of paid annual leave 
* legislated a 40-hour working week (outside of overtime)
* raised wages (15% for the lowest-paid workers, and 7% for the relatively well-paid)
* stipulated that employers would recognise shop stewards
* ensured that there would be no retaliation against strikers

The government legislated its promised reforms as rapidly as possible. On 11 June, the Chamber of Deputies voted for the forty-hour workweek, the restoration of civil servants&#x27; salaries, and two weeks&#x27; paid holidays, by a majority of 528 to 7. The Senate voted in favour of these laws within a week. Blum persuaded the workers to accept pay raises and go back to work. Wages increased sharply; in two years the national average was up 48 percent. However inflation also rose 46%. The imposition of the 40-hour week proved highly inefficient, as industry had a difficult time adjusting to it. The economic confusion hindered the rearmament effort, and the rapid growth of German armaments alarmed Blum. He launched a major program to speed up arms production. The cost forced the abandonment of the social reform programmes that the Popular Front had counted heavily on.

===Additional reforms===
By mid-August 1936, the parliament had voted for:

* the creation of a national &quot;Office du blé&quot; (Grain Board or Wheat Office, through which the government helped to market agricultural produce at fair prices for farmers) to stabilise prices and curb speculation
* the nationalisation of the arms industries
* loans to small and medium-sized industries
* the raising of the compulsory school-attendance age to 14 years
* a major public works programme

It also raised the pay, pensions, and allowances of public-sector workers and ex-servicemen. The 1920 Sales Tax, opposed by the Left as a tax on consumers, was abolished and replaced by a production tax, which was considered to be a tax on the producer instead of the consumer. Blum dissolved the far-right fascist leagues. In turn, the Popular Front was actively fought by right-wing and far-right movements, which often used antisemitic slurs against Blum and other Jewish ministers. The Cagoule far-right group even staged bombings to disrupt the government.

===Foreign policy===
The most important factor in French foreign policy was the Remilitarization of the Rhineland on 7 March 1936 in defiance of the Treaty of Versailles, which had been declared to be a permanent demilitarized zone. With the Rhineland remilitarized, for the first time since 1918 German military forces could menace France directly, and equally importantly the Germans started to build the Siegfried line along the Franco-German border. The assumption behind the French alliance system in Eastern Europe was that the French Army would use the demilitarized status of the Rhineland to launch an offensive into western Germany if the &quot;Reich&quot; should invade any of France&#x27;s allies in Eastern Europe, namely Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. With the building of the Siegfried Line, it was possible for Germany to invade any of France&#x27;s Eastern European allies with the majority of the Wehrmacht being sent east with the remainder of the Wehrmacht staying on the defensive in the Rhineland to halt any French offensive into Germany, a situation that boded ill for the survival of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe. A further complication for the French was the greater population of Germany as France could only field a third of the young men that the &quot;Reich&quot; could field along with the greater size of the German economy. To even the odds against the &quot;Reich&quot;, it was the unanimous opinion of all French foreign policy and military experts that France needed allies. The nation that France wanted the most as an ally was Great Britain, which had the world&#x27;s largest navy and provided that Britain made the &quot;continental commitment&quot; of sending another large expeditionary force to France like the BEF of the First World War would allow the French to face any challenge from Germany on more even terms. The need for the &quot;continental commitment&quot; allowed Britain to have a sort of veto power over French foreign policy in the interwar period as the French wanted the &quot;continental commitment&quot; very badly, and thus could not afford to alienate the British too much. The other major ally the French wanted was the Soviet Union. However, the lack of a common German-Soviet frontier, the unwillingness of Romania and especially Poland to grant the Red Army transit rights, and the strong British dislike of the alliance that the French signed with the Soviet Union in 1935 all presented problems from the French viewpoint. Blum&#x27;s foreign policy was one of attempting to improve relations with Germany to avoid a war while seeking to strengthen France&#x27;s alliances and to conclude an alliance with Britain.

Following a botched coup d&#x27;état on 17 July 1936, a civil war broke out in Spain. Blum initially allowed weapons to be shipped to the &quot;Frente Popular&quot; government, but the arms shipments to the Spanish Republic caused much opposition from Britain. Blum saw the &quot;Frente popular&quot; government in Madrid as a natural ally of the &quot;Front populaire&quot; government in Paris and did not want a pro-Axis Spain as a neighbor. He immediately allowed arms to be shipped to Spain. Charles Corbin, the French ambassador in London, strongly advised Blum to cease the arms shipments to the Spanish Republicans. Corbin warned that the government of Stanley Baldwin was strongly against French arms for the Spanish republic, and that France could not afford a rift with Britain over Spain given the threat posed by Germany. Alexis St. Léger, the secretary-general of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, met Blum to tell him that France needed Britain more than Britain needed France, and the French could not afford to antagonize the British for the sake of the Spanish Republic. The need for British support played a major role in causing Blum to cease the arms shipments to Spain and instead have France join the ineffectual Non-Intervention Committee. In July 1936, the League of Nations ended the sanctions imposed on Italy for invading Ethiopia, and therefore, France ended its sanctions on Italy. The French tried hard to revive the Stresa Front after the sanctions on Italy were ended and as the American historian Barry Sullivan noted &quot;...the French displayed an almost humiliating determination to retain Italy as an ally&quot;. Benito Mussolini rejected all of the French overtures and instead aligned Italy with Germany. Sullivan noted: &quot;...Germany, which consistently treated Italy worse than did the other two countries, was rewarded with Mussolini&#x27;s friendship; France, which generally offered Italy the highest level of co-operation and true partnership, was rewarded with rebuffs and abuse.&quot;. The prospect of an Italian-German alliance threatened to divert French resources from a potential conflict with Germany, and drove the French into seeking closer ties with Britain as a counterbalance. 
Shortly after his election, Blum together with his entire cabinet visited the German embassy to meet the new German ambassador, Count Johannes von Welczeck, to tell him that France wanted good relations with Germany and that his government intended to return to the &quot;Locarno era&quot; of the 1920s (i.e. friendship with Germany). German propaganda constantly stressed that one of the many alleged &quot;injustices&quot; of the Treaty of Versailles was the loss of Germany&#x27;s African colonies and demanded that all of the former African colonies &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;. Blum believed that the colonial question was the principal problem in Franco-German relations and that there was a &quot;moderate&quot; faction within the German government led by the &quot;Reichsbank&quot; president Dr. Hjalmar Schacht who were both willing and able to restrain Adolf Hitler. During the 1936 election, Blum had run on an anti-militarist platform that called for &quot;bread, peace and freedom&quot; while he had promised to end the arms race by converting from an &quot;armed peace&quot; into a &quot;disarmed peace&quot;. When Schacht approached Blum with an offer to end the arms race in exchange for the return of former German African colonies, Blum took him up on his offer. In August 1936, Schacht visited Paris where he met Blum to discuss a possible deal under which France would return the former German African colonies administered by France as mandates for the League of Nations and the end of the trade wars in Europe in exchange for Germany cutting back dramatically its level of military spending. Blum told Schacht that he was willing to return French Togoland (modern Togo) and French Cameroon (modern Cameroon) to Germany as the price of peace, and pursued this line of negotiation with Schacht well into 1937. However, Blum also told Schacht that France would not be bullied as he stated: &quot;We believe our position is stronger than a few months ago. France does not tremble in the face of war, but does not want war&quot;. Blum still held hopes that the arms race in Europe could be ended, and feeling that the Treaty of Versailles was excessively harsh, he welcomed Schacht&#x27;s offer, which seemed to be a sincere proposal to end the arms race. The British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden who visited Paris told Blum he was &quot;thoroughly astounded&quot; by his talks with Schacht, which he warned that the British government would be opposed under the grounds if France returned the former German colonies in Africa to the &quot;Reich&quot; it would pressure for Britain, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to return the former German colonies they administered as mandates for the League of Nations.

Schacht gave Blum the impression that he held more power in Berlin than was actually the case, and that the key to preventing another world war lay in the restoration of the German colonial empire in Africa. At the time, Schacht was losing a power struggle over the control of German economic policy to the other Nazi leaders and he was keen for a foreign policy success such as the restoration of Germany&#x27;s former African colonies that might restore his prestige with Hitler. Blum had good relations with both Welczeck and Schacht whom he viewed as &quot;rational, civilized Europeans&quot; whom it was possible for him to negotiate with. Notably, Hitler refused to see Blum under any conditions and Welczeck was Blum&#x27;s main conduit with the &quot;Reich&quot; government. In September 1936, Hitler at the Nuremberg Party Rally launched the Four Year Plan to have the German economy ready for a &quot;total war&quot; by September 1940, which greatly alarmed Blum. In response to the Four Year Plan, Blum launched what the American historian Joseph Maiolo called &quot;the biggest arms program ever attempted by a French government in peacetime&quot;. Intelligence from the &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot; and André François-Poncet, the French ambassador in Berlin, showed that the factories of the major German armaments firms such as Krupp AG, Rheinmetall AG and Borsig AG were running at full capacity as the German state seemed to have a limitless appetite for arms. All the intelligence from François-Poncet and the &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot; indicated that Germany was preparing for a major war in the near-future. The fact that Germany had an economy three times larger than France&#x27;s ensured that the &quot;Reich&quot; had a massive lead in the arms race. However, the French took consolation in the fact that Germany had to import a number of crucial raw materials such as high-grade iron and oil that the &quot;Reich&quot; lacked, thereby making Germany very vulnerable to a naval blockade. However, there was the caveat that many of the raw materials that Germany lacked could be found in eastern Europe and if Germany were to obtain such raw materials in eastern Europe via alliances or conquests, the German economy would be immune to a blockade. As such from the French viewpoint it was crucial to keep Eastern Europe out of the German sphere of influence. The War Minister, Édouard Daladier asked the commander of the military, General Maurice Gamelin to submit a four-year plan for military modernization. When Gamelin handed in a plan that was budgeted at 9 billion francs for the French Army, Daladier rejected it as too low and added an extra 5 billion francs. During an &quot;emotional&quot; interview with Blum, Daladier persuaded him to accept the 14 billion franc plan as he warned that Germany was winning the arms race at present. On 7 September 1936, the Blum cabinet approved Daladier&#x27;s 14 billion franc plan for rearmament.

At the time the franc was overvalued, as it was still based on the gold standard. Blum, however, had promised during the election to uphold the gold standard, in order to reassure voters worried about inflation. In the expectation of the franc being devalued, throughout the prior year, investors had been moving a massive amount of capital and gold out of France. The overvalued franc made French exports expensive while making foreign imports cheaper in comparison with French goods. The sums allocated to the arms race with some 21 billion francs for the French military committed in total accelerated this capital flight as bond investors saw the Popular Front&#x27;s fiscal policies as irresponsible. Maiolo wrote: &quot;Everyone knew the Popular Front could not cut the deficit and fund work creation projects, nationalize the arms industry and buy arms without borrowing. By hoarding their capital abroad, private speculators in effect vetoed the policies of the Popular Front&quot;. By mid-September 1936 France&#x27;s gold reserves had fallen close to 50 billion francs, which was the minimum amount considered necessary to fund rearmament. To stabilize the economy and pay for rearmament, Blum engaged in secret talks for Anglo-American financial support. On 26 September 1936, the franc was devalued while on the same day an economic agreement on currency stabilization with the United States and the United Kingdom was announced. In a show of support for Blum, neither the Americans nor the British increased their tariffs on French goods nor were the dollar and pound devalued in response, which allowed the French to increase their exports now made cheaper by a devalued franc. The devaluation of the franc did not prompt the return of gold and capital to France as Blum had hoped, and Blum was forced to turn towards Britain to ask for a loan to stabilize the franc, which gave the British leverage over his government. Blum&#x27;s experience in government left him convinced that it was the traders on the bond markets that really dominated the world, not national governments as he constantly faced himself having to adjust his policies to appease the bond markets. Blum seriously considered pursuing autarky and exchange controls as a way to pay for rearmament as he told the cabinet &quot;by attempting to oppose fascism&#x27;s bid for power...one is too often tempted to follow its footsteps&quot;. However, Blum was told by the Finance ministry that &quot;Germany is on the verge of an economic and financial catastrophe because of rearmament&quot;. Moreover, the Radical Party threatened to pull out of the Popular Front if exchange controls were imposed and both American and British diplomats quietly told Blum that neither the United States nor the United Kingdom would support France if it imposed exchange controls. Blum told the Chamber of Deputies: &quot;The logical inclination of our internal policy would lead us to adopt coercive measures against the export of capital and currency speculation. But that would be to create a contradiction between our policy which seeks a community of action with the great Anglo-Saxon nations and the signing of a monetary agreement aimed at restoring activity and liberty to international trade&quot;.

As the talks with Schacht faltered, Blum turned towards the alliance with the Soviet Union and France&#x27;s other eastern European allies. The Blum government attempted to build an institutional bond to link France on a collective basis with the Little Entente alliance of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Romania. After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, both King Carol II of Romania and Milan Stojadinović of Yugoslavia rejected the French offer and preferred to move closer to Germany out of the belief that France would do nothing to assist their nations in the event of a German invasion. Even President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia-generally regarded as the Eastern European leader most committed to upholding his country&#x27;s alliance with France-attempted to improve his relations with Germany after the Rhineland remiltarization. Franco-Polish relations had been badly strained ever since the German-Polish non-aggression pact of 1934, but in the aftermath of the Rhineland remiltarization, the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Józef Beck expressed the wish for French financial and military aid to modernize the Polish military. Beck&#x27;s friendship with Hermann Göring led to doubts on Blum&#x27;s part about his precise loyalty to France, but the fact that Germany was still laying claim to the Polish corridor, Upper Silesia and the Free City of Danzig suggested that the German-Polish rapprochement might be only ephemeral. Blum told Daladier and Gamelin: &quot;We cannot live this way. We are bound by an alliance with a state and a people, yet we have so little confidence in them that we hesitate to deliver them arms, designs, plans-for the fear that they will betray us and deliver them to the enemy. We must know whether the Poles are our allies or not&quot;. Blum sent Gamelin to Warsaw to ask Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły, another member of the triumvirate that was the leadership of the &quot;Sanacja&quot; military dictatorship, to dismiss Beck as foreign minister. Rydz-Śmigły insisted that his country was still committed to upholding the Franco-Polish alliance, but refused to sack Beck. In September 1936, Rydz-Śmigły visited Paris for two weeks, and Blum met him several times to request that he sack Beck. Beck was not dismissed, but Blum signed an agreement for France to provide the money to allow Poland to create an arms industry. In regards to Asia, Blum appointed Émile Naggiar as the French ambassador to China with instructions to provide French aid to assist with the modernization of China as a way to counterbalance the power of Japan.

In October 1936, William Christian Bullitt Jr. arrived as the new American ambassador in Paris. Besides being the first American ambassador to France in the last 16 years who actually spoke French, Bullitt was one of the best friends of President Franklin D. Roosevelt with whom he spoke on the telephone once a day. Blum had a very close friendship with Bullitt, a man he greatly liked and admired. Though Blum never met Roosevelt, he admired him and he openly admitted that his social reforms were based on the New Deal as Blum declared in a speech: &quot;Seeing him [Roosevelt] act, the French democracy has a feeling that an example was traced for it, and it is this example we are following&quot;. Bullitt came to be an influential man in France and was known as the &quot;unofficial minister without portfolio&quot; in the French cabinet. Knowing that Bullitt was one of the best friends of Roosevelt, Blum tried hard to use him to get the United States more involved in Europe. Blum told Bullitt: &quot;America alone of the great powers was genuinely interested in the same policies he was trying to put through. The British government was working with him wholeheartedly and sincerely in certain fields but because it was a Conservative government it disapproved highly of his domestic policy and the sympathy he received in London was therefore half-hearted&quot;. 

Of France&#x27;s eastern European allies, the one that Blum considered the most important was the Soviet Union. Blum&#x27;s past battles with the French Communists made him wary of Soviet Russia, but he noted that the Soviet Union was easily the most powerful of France&#x27;s eastern European allies. Blum favored what he called his &quot;grand design&quot; under which first Anglo-French relations would be strengthened, to be followed by a strengthening of Franco-Soviet relations, and finally France would play the matchmaker and achieve an Anglo-Soviet rapprochement. Blum&#x27;s ultimate aim was to recreate &quot;a combination reproducing the Triple Entente before 1914&quot;. Blum was later to claim that his &quot;grand design&quot; would have prevented World War Two as he stated in 1947: &quot;The close rapprochement of the Anglo-Saxon and French democracies with Soviet Russia, that is to say, an international Popular Front, would have been the salvation of the peace&quot;. The Franco-Soviet alliance had been signed in May 1935, but no staff talks had been opened to draft operational plans. By the fall of 1936, the Soviets were openly impatient and pressing for Franco-Soviet staff talks as it was noted that a military alliance without staff talks for a military convention was in effect worthless. Blum appointed Robert Coulondre as the French ambassador in Moscow with orders to strengthen the Franco-Soviet alliance. When Coulondre presented his credentials as an ambassador for France to Soviet Chairman Mikhail Kalinin, he was told quite bluntly that if the French were really serious about the alliance, staff talks should have been started sometime ago. On 6 November 1936, Blum ordered Daladier and Gamelin to open Franco-Soviet staff talks with the aim of concluding a military convention to give effect to the Franco-Soviet alliance. On 9 November 1936, Blum told the Soviet ambassador, Vladimir Potemkin, that it was &quot;a step forward&quot; for France and the Soviet Union to begin staff talks.

Because Germany&#x27;s population was three times greater than France&#x27;s, the French Army had been heavily dependent upon manpower recruited in the Maghreb in the First World War and it was expected to be so again in another war. By 1936, over one-third of the French Army was being recruited in the Maghreb, making France the European nation most dependent upon its colonial soldiers. The need to bring over soldiers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia in turn required control of the western Mediterranean Sea. The increasing hostile stance of Fascist Italy towards France led to fears in Paris that Italy would ally itself with the &quot;Reich&quot; and that the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; would cut France off from the Maghreb. Much of Blum&#x27;s concerns about maintaining mastery of the Mediterranean related to France&#x27;s dependence upon manpower from the Maghreb. Mussolini&#x27;s strident speeches in the fall of 1936 denouncing the &quot;Jewish socialist&quot; Blum who headed a &quot;decadent plutodemocracy&quot; did not auger well for the future of Franco-Italian relations. Blum sent Admiral François Darlan to London to seek staff talks between the &quot;Marine&quot; and the Royal Navy against Italy, but the effort was rebuked by the Admiralty. On 4 December 1936, Blum approved of a three-year naval construction programmne designed to make the &quot;Marine&quot; the dominant naval power in the Mediterranean. Blum praised Darlan as an admiral who &quot;thinks exactly as I do&quot; about a potential naval threat from Italy. Blum sacked the Naval Commander-in-Chief, the Italianophile Admiral Georges Durand-Viel who had advocated a Franco-Italian alliance and appointed Darlan as his successor. Darlan became increasing vociferous in advocating the view that France needed a strong &quot;Marine&quot; to ensure command of the sea in the Mediterranean in order to bring over soldiers from the Maghreb to help the French Army face the Wehrmacht on more equal terms. Gamelin strongly argued in favor of a renewed attempt to make an alliance with Italy under the grounds that a rapprochement with Mussolini would be cheaper than a naval arms race, but Blum chose to accept Darlan&#x27;s counsel that a stronger Mediterranean Fleet was the best way of safeguarding the sea-lanes to Algeria. In a covert operation, the Deuxième Bureau started to smuggle in arms from the colony of French Somaliland (modern Djibouti) to anti-Italian guerrillas in Ethiopia as a way to tie down Italian forces in the Horn of Africa, and keep them well away from France.

In December 1936, the French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos contracted Welczeck with an offer for joint Franco-German mediation to end the Spanish Civil War. Provided that the Spanish Civil War could be ended, Delbos was willing to begin talks on the return of the former German colonies plus agreements to end the arms race and the trade wars in Europe. In exchange, Delbos wanted an end to the Four Year Plan. On 18 December 1936, Blum met Welczeck to tell him that the entire cabinet had approved of the offer, saying this was the best chance to save the peace in Europe. Welczeck was personally in favor of accepting Blum&#x27;s offer, but the German Foreign Minister, Baron Konstantin von Neurath was opposed and persuaded Hitler to reject the offer. Part of the reason for the French urgency in seeking to improve relations with the &quot;Reich&quot; was the decision on the part of Belgium to renounce the alliance with France it had signed in 1920 and declare itself neutral again. The Maginot Line covered the Franco-German border and Franco-Luxembourg border, but did not cover the Franco-Belgian border as Belgium was a French ally when construction of the line started in 1930. With Belgium neutral, a way was open for Germany to invade France again as Blum noted that France would respect Belgian neutrality, but Germany would not. The precedent of 1914 when Germany violated Belgian neutrality as the best way to invade France did not suggest that Germany would respect Belgian neutrality again. Blum ordered the Maginot line to be extended along the Franco-Belgian border, but only little work had been accomplished by 1939 and France was still very much exposed to a German invasion via Belgium. Blum met in secret with the Belgian prime minister Paul van Zeeland to ask him to allow secret Franco-Belgian staff talks to coordinate operations should Germany invade Belgium again but van Zeeland refused. By early 1937, Blum had grown disenchanted with Schacht whom he was starting to suspect had less power in Germany than what he claimed. On 30 January 1937, Hitler gave a speech to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; where he stated that he wanted the return of Germany&#x27;s former African colonies without preconditions such as cuts to military spending. On 13 February 1937, Blum told the Chamber of Deputies that his government had imposed a &quot;pause&quot; on social reforms and a 20 billion franc plan for public works was suspended until further notice to pay for rearmament.

Despite the rejection of the offer for a colonial settlement, Blum&#x27;s continuing talks with Dr. Schacht into 1937 led to concerns within the cabinet of new British prime minister Neville Chamberlain that if France returned Togoland and Cameroon to Germany, Britain would come under pressure to return Tanganyika (modern Tanzania) to Germany. The Chamberlain cabinet expressed concern over the fact that Blum had made an offer to return Togoland and Cameroon to Germany, which was felt to have weaken Britain&#x27;s case for hanging onto Tanganyika. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote both the governments of Blum and Chamberlain were serious about returning the former German African colonies in some form by 1937 as he noted there was a consensus that &quot;...the price-as perceived from London and Paris if not from Douala and Lomé-would be worth paying&quot;. However, Hitler wanted the return of the former African colonies without the conditions that Blum and Chamberlain wanted such as a drastic reduction in military spending and the end of the Four Year Plan.

The Franco-Soviet staff talks stained Anglo-French relations with the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden telling Blum during a visit to Paris in May 1937 that his government was opposed to Franco-Soviet staff talks as dangerous to the peace of Europe, a request that Blum rejected. The Franco-Soviet staff talks came to a sudden end in June 1937 due to the &quot;Yezhovshchina&quot; (&quot;Yezhov times&quot;). On 12 June 1937, Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky along with two other Marshals of the Soviet Union were shot on charges of treason and espionage for Germany and Japan. Gamelin promptly suspended the staff talks under the grounds that since the Soviet government itself had accused Tukhachevsky of being a spy for Germany and Japan then logically all the information that he shared with Tukhachevsky must had reached Berlin and Tokyo. Gamelin started that staff talks would only be resumed only once the executions of senior Red Army officers on charges of espionage for Germany and Japan ended, saying at present it was far risky for the French general staff to be engaged in staff talks with the Red Army general staff given the frequency that Red Army officers kept being executed for espionage. The decision to suspend the staff talks became a major issue in Franco-Soviet relations, and Jakob Suritz, the new Soviet ambassador in Paris who replaced Potemkin, pressed Blum very strongly to have the staff talks resumed as soon as possible. Likewise, Suritz was furious over the decision to halt the arms shipments to the Spanish Republic and accused Blum of being too concerned about maintaining good Anglo-French relations.

===Spanish Civil War===

The Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936 and deeply divided France. Blum adopted a policy of neutrality rather than assisting his ideological fellows, the Spanish Left-leaning Republicans. He acted from fear of splitting his domestic alliance with the centrist Radicals, or even precipitating an ideological civil war inside France. His refusal to send arms to Spain strained his alliance with the Communists, who followed Soviet policy and demanded all-out support for the Spanish Republic. The impossible dilemma caused by this issue led Blum to resign in June 1937. All the constituents of the French left supported the Republican government in Madrid, while the right supported the Nationalist insurgents. Blum&#x27;s cabinet was deeply divided and he decided on a policy of non-intervention, and collaborated with Britain and 25 other countries to formalize an agreement against sending any munitions or volunteer soldiers to Spain. The Air Minister defied the cabinet and secretly sold warplanes to Madrid. Jackson concludes that the French government &quot;was virtually paralyzed by the menace of civil war at home, the German danger abroad, and the weakness of her own defenses.&quot; The Republicans by 1938 were losing badly (they gave up in 1939), sending upwards of 500,000 political refugees across the border into France, where they were held in camps.

===Attacks on Blum===
On 13 February 1936, shortly before becoming Prime Minister, Blum was dragged from a car and almost beaten to death by the Camelots du Roi, a group of antisemites and royalists. The group&#x27;s parent organisation, the right-wing Action Française league, was dissolved by the government following this incident, not long before the elections that brought Blum to power. Blum became the first socialist and the first Jew to serve as Prime Minister of France. As such he was an object of particular hatred from antisemitic elements.

In its short life, the Popular Front government passed important legislation, including the 40-hour week, 12 paid annual holidays for the workers, collective bargaining on wage claims, and the full nationalisation of the armament and military aviation industries. This latter sweeping action had the unanticipated effect of disrupting the production of armaments at the wrong time, only three years away from the beginning of war in September 1939. Blum also attempted to pass legislation extending the rights of the Arab population of Algeria, but this was blocked by &quot;colons&quot;, colonist representatives in the Chamber and Senate.

===Second government in 1938 and collapse===
Blum was briefly Prime Minister again in March and April 1938, long enough to ship heavy artillery and other much needed military equipment to the Spanish Republicans. Blum made a call to the parties of the centre-right to create a &quot;sacred union&quot; government like that which had governed France in World War One to face the present crisis, an offer that was rejected. Besides for allowing arms to be shipped to Spain, on 15 March 1938 Blum proposed at a cabinet meeting that France intervene in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Republicans. Blum told the cabinet: &quot;Why not send General Franco an ultimatum? If, within twenty-four hours, you do not renounce the assistance of foreign troops France will resume its liberty of action and the right to intervene&quot;. As Italy and Germany had intervened on the side of the Spanish Nationalists, the majority of the cabinet led by Daladier rejected Blum&#x27;s course under the grounds that it would mean war with Italy and Germany.

Blum drew up a new armament plan in early 1938 that was as he put it &quot;analogous to the Russian Five Year Plans or Göring&#x27;s Four Year Plan&quot;. To finance the armament plan, Blum planned a steep increase in taxes on income and corporate profits, to borrow on a massive scale on the bond markets, to embark on an inflationary course by printing more francs in the form of credit notes to pay for munitions, and for exchange controls to stop the expected flight of capital. The American Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. sent word to Blum that the Roosevelt administration would not oppose &quot;temporary&quot; exchange controls in France, though the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was non-committal when sounded out. Blum&#x27;s armament plan was defeated in the Senate on 5 April 1938, leading to him to resign. He was unable to establish a stable ministry; on 10 April 1938, his socialist government fell and he was removed from office. In foreign policy, his government was torn between the traditional anti-militarism of the French Left and the urgency of the rising threat of Nazi Germany.

Many historians judge the Popular Front a failure in terms of economics, foreign policy, and long-term stability. &quot;Disappointment and failure,&quot; says Jackson, &quot;was the legacy of the Popular Front.&quot; There is general agreement that at first it created enormous excitement and expectation on the left, but in the end it failed to live up to its promise.

==End of the Popular Front==
The new government led by Édouard Daladier cooperated with Britain. Despite being on the opposite sides of the ideological divide, starting on 14 April 1938 the Conservative MP Winston Churchill started a correspondence with Blum, sending him a series of letters written in his idiosyncratic French, encouraging him to support rearmament and oppose appeasement. During the Sudetenland crisis of 1938, Daladier accepted the offer of the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain to serve as a &quot;honest broker&quot; in an attempt to find a compromise. Chamberlain met with Adolf Hitler at a summit at Berchtesgaden where he agreed that the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia would be transferred to Germany. At a subsequent Anglo-German summit at Bad Godesberg, Hitler rejected Chamberlain&#x27;s plan over a secondary issue as he demanded that the Sudetenland be transferred to Germany before 1 October 1938 while the Anglo-French plan called for a transfer to occur after 1 October. For a time in September 1938, it appeared that Europe was on brink of a war again. The fact that that issue at stake was only a secondary issue, namely the timetable for transferring the Sudetenland, after the primary issue had been settled struck many as bizarre.

When Blum learned on 28 September that an emergency summit would be held in Munich the next day to resolve the crisis, he wrote that felt &quot;an immense response of joy and hope&quot;. On 29 September, Blum wrote in an editorial in &quot;Le Popularie&quot; newspaper: &quot; The Munich meeting is an armful of tinder thrown on a sacred flame at the very moment the flame was flickering and threatening to go out&quot;. The Munich Agreement that ended the crisis was a compromise as it was affirmed that the Sudetenland would be transferred to Germany but only after 1 October, albeit on a schedule that favored the German demand to have the Sudetenland &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot; as soon as possible. When the Munich Agreement was signed on 30 September 1938, Blum wrote that he felt &quot;soulagement honteux&quot;&quot; (&quot;shameful relief&quot;) as he wrote that he was happy that France would not be going to war with Germany, but he felt ashamed of an agreement that favored Germany at the expense of Czechoslovakia. On 1 October 1938, Blue wrote in &quot;Le Popularie&quot;: &quot;There is not a woman and a man to refuse MM. Neville Chamberlain and Édouard Daladier their rightful tribute of gratitude. War is avoided. The scourge recedes. Life can become natural again. One can resume one&#x27;s work and sleep again. One can enjoy the beauty of an autumn sun. How would it be possible for me not to understand this sense of deliverance when I feel it myself?&quot;

The Munich Agreement badly split the Socialists into a pacifistic antiwar group that supported the agreement vs. an antifascist group that was opposed, and Blum struggled to find a compromise that would avoid splitting the Socialists. The debate was also made more difficult as Blum faced accusations that because he was a Jew that he wanted a war with Germany for the sake of German Jews instead of French national interests, which explained Blum&#x27;s reluctance to be appear to be too anti-German and pro-war. During the vote on the Munich Agreement in the &quot;Chambre des députés&quot; on 4 October 1938, Blum voted for the Munich Agreement. During the debate on the Munich Agreement, Blum declared: &quot;This deeply felt and impassioned will for peace cannot lead a people to accept everything; on the contrary, it strengthens the resolve to struggle, to sacrifice itself, in necessary for independence and freedom, it does not abolish the distinction what is just and unjust&quot;. Blum&#x27;s contorted position of voting for the Munich Agreement, but being opposed to further appeasement was largely an attempt to hold together the Socialists. In the months that followed, Blum became more critical of the &quot;men of Munich&quot;. The principle object of his criticism was not Daladier-whom he knew to be a reluctant appeaser-but rather the Foreign Minister, Georges Bonnet. Bonnet was known to be the advocate of some sort of Franco-German understanding under which France would recognize Eastern Europe as being in the German sphere of influence and abandon all of France&#x27;s allies in Eastern Europe. Blum focused his criticism on Bonnet as the main advocate of appeasement in the cabinet.

In an attempt to improve productivity in the French armament industry, especially its aviation industry, the Finance Minister Paul Reynaud supported by Daladier, brought in a series of sweeping laws that undid much of the Popular Front&#x27;s economic policies, most notably ending the 48 hour work week. Blum joined forces with the Communists in opposing the Daladier government&#x27;s economic policies, and supported the general strike called by the Communists on 30 November 1938. Daladier called out the French Army to operate essential services and had the French police use tear gas to evict striking workers at the Renault works. The use of the military to operate essential services while sending out the police to arrest the strike leaders broke the general strike. In a speech, Blum accused Daladier of using repressive methods to crush the French working class and revert France back to the pre-1936 economic system. Complicating matters was the beginning of an acute crisis in Italo-French relations. On 30 November 1938-the same day as the general strike-a carefully staged &quot;spontaneous&quot; demonstration organized by the Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano took place in the Italian Chamber of Deputies where on cue all of the deputies rose up to shout &quot;Tunis, Corsica, Nice, Savoy!&quot; Benito Mussolini had intended to use what he called &quot;Sudeten methods&quot; on France as the Italian media started a violent anti-French campaign demanding that France cede Corsica, Nice, Savoy and Tunisia to Italy. Daladier responded with a series of resolute speeches on French radio where he rejected all of the Italian demands, which won him much popularity in France. From the viewpoint of Blum, being opposed to Daladier at a time when he won himself many accolades as the defender of France&#x27;s territorial integrity against Italy was politically difficult. At the next session of the &quot;Chambre des députés&quot; on 9 December 1938, the Popular Front formally came to an end as Daladier chose to base his majority of the parties of the right and center. Despite the end of the Popular Front, Blum did not press for a vote of no-confidence or new elections. Blum believed that Daladier would win an election if one was called, and the Socialists did not vote for a Communist motion of no-confidence in the Daladier government.

At a Socialist Party congress in Montrouge in December 1938, Blum called upon his party to abandon pacifism and support French rearmament. Blum argued that the idea championed by his mentor Jaures of general strikes in all European nations to stop a war was no longer possible as the trade unions and the Social Democratic Party in Germany had been long since banned, and there was no possibility of a general strike in the &quot;Reich&quot; to stop a war. In a speech delivered on 27 December 1938, Blum accused the governments of Germany, Italy and Japan of being committed to policies of ultra-aggressive imperialism and argued that the way to stop another world war was rearmament and an alliance of all the states threatened by the Axis powers. Blum stated that he did not want a war, but he favored rearmament to avoid the &quot;atrocious choice between submission and war&quot;. On 28 December, the congress ended with 4, 332 Socialist delegates voting for Blum&#x27;s call for rearmament vs. 2, 837 votes for Paul Faure&#x27;s pacifist motion opposing rearmament and another 1, 014 delegates who chose to abstain themselves from the vote. Through Blum had triumphed at the Montrouge congress, the results of the vote showed a significant element of the Socialist Party opposed to or at least lukewarm about rearmament. On 10 February 1939, Blum met with the Soviet ambassador in Paris, Jakob Suritz, where he told him of his belief that Daladier and Bonnet were leading France &quot;to a new Sedan&quot;. Suritz described Blum as morose and disconsolate as he noted that Blum seemed convinced that France was heading towards a catastrophe without being willing to do anything to stop it.

==Danzig crisis==
During the Danzig crisis of 1939, Blum supported the measures taken by Britain and France to &quot;contain&quot; Germany and deter the &quot;Reich&quot; from invading Poland. The Danzig crisis forced Blum into the ambivalent position of supporting the foreign policy of the Daladier government while opposing its economic and social policies. Blum spoke in favor of greater military spending as he noted in an editorial in &quot;Le Popularie&quot; on 1 April 1939: &quot;This is the state which the dictators have led Europe. For us Socialists, for us pacifists, the appeal to force is today the appeal for peace&quot;. When U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a public letter to Hitler on 14 April 1939, asking him to promise to not threaten his neighbors, Blum expressed hope that this might be a solution for the crisis. However, in a brutal speech to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; on 28 April 1939, Hitler publicly mocked Roosevelt&#x27;s appeal. Blum&#x27;s support for Roosevelt&#x27;s letter was the only time in the crisis that he expressed support for a measure of reconciliation with Germany.

During the crisis, Blum was greatly alarmed at the attitude of the British Labour Party, which were stoutly opposed to peacetime conscription, The Labour Party were planning make the prospect of peacetime conscription into an election issue (a general election was expected in Britain in 1939 or 1940), which the Chamberlain government gave as the major reason for opposing peacetime conscription. Blum wrote to several Labour leaders as one Socialist to another, urging that Labour support peacetime conscription as necessary to resist Germany. Blum argued that France needed the &quot;continental commitment&quot; from Britain (i.e. send a large expeditionary force to France), which in turn required peacetime conscription as the current system of an all-volunteer army would never suffice for the &quot;continental commitment&quot;. Blum stated in a public letter to the Labour Party in &quot;Le Popularie&quot; on 27 April 1939 that he did not like the Chamberlain government, but on the issue of peacetime conscription: &quot;I do not hesitate to state to my Labour comrades my deepest conviction that at very moment at which I write, conscription in England is one of the capital acts upon which the peace of the world depends&quot;. Blum visited London to lobby the Labour leaders to support peacetime conscription, and met Chamberlain during the same visit. In a speech in the House of Commons on 11 May 1939, Chamberlain stated: &quot;I had the opportunity yesterday of exchanging a few words with M. Blum, the French Socialist leader and former Prime Minister, and he said to me that in his view, and in the view of all the Socialist friends he had talked to, that there was only one danger of war in Europe, and that was a real one: It was that the impression should get about that Great Britain and France were not in earnest, and that they could not be relied upon to carry out their promises. If that there were so, no greater, no more deadly mistake could be made-and if it would be a frightful thing if Europe were to be plunged into war on the account of a misunderstanding. In many minds, the danger spot today is Danzig...if an attempt were made to change the situation by force in such a way as to threaten Polish independence, they would inevitably start a general conflagration in which this country would be involved.&quot; Upon his return to Paris, Blum gave a speech in the &quot;Chambre des députés&quot; that called upon France to stand by its alliance with Poland and in an implicit criticism of Bonnet called upon France &quot;to fulfill without equivocation and without fail its pledges of mutual assurance and guarantee&quot;.

Blum supported the plans for a &quot;peace front&quot; to unite Britain, France and the Soviet Union with the aim of deterring Germany from invading Poland. Knowing that the major issue that was blocking the &quot;peace front&quot; talks were the demand by the Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov for the Red Army to have transit rights into Poland in the event of a German invasion, which the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Józef Beck was utterly opposed to granting, Blum expressed much anger in his editorials as he wrote in an editorial on 25 June 1939 there was &quot;not a day, not a hour to lose&quot; as he urged Beck to concede on the transit rights issue. On 22 August 1939, Blum expressed hope in an editorial in &quot;Le Popularie&quot; that the &quot;clouds of pessimism&quot; would soon disappear as he asserted that the &quot;peace front&quot; would soon be in existence, which would in turn would deter the &quot;Reich&quot; from invading Poland. The next day, the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop arrived in Moscow to sign the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact. On 24 August 1939, Blum wrote in an editorial that the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact was &quot;a truly extraordinary event, almost incredible, one is dumbfounded by the blow&quot;. In his editorial, Blum strongly condemned Joseph Stalin for the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact as he wrote: &quot;One would hardly be able to demonstrate greater audacity, scorn for world opinion and defiance of public morality&quot;. Blum wrote that his reaction to the famous photograph of Ribbentrop and Molotov signing the pact in the Kremlin while being watched by a smiling Stalin that: &quot;I would try in vain to conceal my stupefaction&quot;. Blum used the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact to try to have French Communists to break with the Comintern as he urged the Communists to &quot;become free men again&quot; by ceasing to follow the orders of Moscow. Though Blum did not seriously expect the French Communists to break with Moscow, he did have hopes of winning the Communist voters over to the Socialists, whom he presented as the patriotic party committed to both socialism and France&#x27;s interests.

==Second World War==
On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. On 2 September 1939, Blum voted in the &quot;Chambre des députés&quot; for war credits to the government and urged the government to stand by its alliance with Poland. Daladier declared war on Germany when it invaded Poland on 3 September 1939. In an editorial in &quot;Le Popularie&quot; on 3 September 1939, Blum wrote: &quot;Never was the violence more flagrant on one hand, and never was the will for peace more certain and more tenacious on the other&quot;. Eight months of Phoney War thereafter, saw little or no movement in Western Europe. Blum argued that the existing cabinet was too awkward and urged France to copy the British example of an elite &quot;war cabinet&quot; that consisted of the key ministers. In the fall of 1939, Blum met with the Finance Minister Paul Reynaud and his protégé, Colonel Charles de Gaulle, to criticize Daladier&#x27;s conduct of the war. Despite his support for the war, Blum criticized Daladier for banning the French Communist Party after the party declared its opposition to the war. During the Winter War, Blum praised Finland for its &quot;sublime resistance&quot; to the Soviet Union. Blum called the Soviet aggression against Finland a &quot;crime&quot; and accused Stalin of being an imperialist disguised as a Communist as stated that Stalin was the heir of Peter the Great, not Vladimir Lenin. In February 1940, the American Undersecretary of State, Sumner Welles, visited Paris as part of a peace mission on behalf of President Roosevelt. Blum met with Welles to tell him that he was wasting his time as no peace on reasonable terms was possible with Hitler. The defeat of Finland led to the fall of Daladier who had promised French aid to the Finns. Blum declared his support for the new Reynaud government, which promised to prosecute the war more vigorously.

On 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht launched the Manstein variant of &quot;Fall Gelb&quot; (&quot;Case Yellow&quot;) and invaded France via Belgium to by-pass the Maginot line. Blum noted bitterly that Germany no more respected Belgian neutrality in 1940 than what the &quot;Reich&quot; had done in 1914, and Belgium&#x27;s neutral status allowed the Wehrmacht a head-start in the invasion. The same day saw the fall of the Chamberlain government with Winston Churchill forming a new coalition government in London. Blum in an editorial in &quot;Le Populaire&quot; hailed the new Churchill government as a positive step. Blum had been invited before &quot;Fall Gelb&quot; to attend a Labour Party congress, and was especially keen to go as several of the Labour leaders were now cabinet ministers. Before leaving France, Reynaud met with Blum to tell him that the Wehrmacht was pressing very hard on the front on the Meuse river as Reynauld told him: &quot;It is on the Meuse that we must at this moment with all our strength together defend our common safety&quot;. On 13–14 May 1940, Blum was in Bournemouth to attend the Labour Party congress. At the Bournemouth congress, Blum was cheered as a great socialist. As Blum spoke no English, he gave a short speech in French where he declared: &quot;The war we are waging against Germany is not a capitalist war. I do not know what would become of capitalism if Hitler were to win the war, but I do know what would become of socialism if Germany were victorious. Wherever the motorized Attila has passed, every movement and institution created by the workers has been destroyed&quot;. On 15 May, the Labour leader Clement Attlee did his best to tell Blum in his broken French that the Wehrmacht had won the Second Battle of Sedan and smashed its way though the French lines along the Meuse river, which came as a considerable shock once Blum finally understood what Attlee was trying to say.

Blum returned to Paris at once, and met Reynaud who told him that he was bringing in Marshal Phillippe Petain into his cabinet to reassure French public opinion. Blum did not see the appointment of Petain-whom he called &quot;the most noblest, the most human of our military chiefs&quot;-as a problem. Petain, the victor of the Battle of Verdun in 1916 was a beloved and deeply respected figure in France where he was seen as the greatest living French war hero and Reynaud saw Petain in his cabinet as way to reassure the public. Blum later wrote that he had been in &quot;illusion&quot; about Petain who immediately became the loudest voice of defeatism in the cabinet. Likewise, he did not oppose the appointment of Marshal Maxime Weygand as the new commander-in-chief to replace Maurice Gamelin, which he came to regret. Blum stated that he felt that Reynaud was correct to sack Gamelin-a soldier known for his loyalty to the republic-as he felt that Gemalin had lost control of the situation and that he hoped Weygand would restore France&#x27;s fortunes. He was later to say that had he been aware that Weygand&#x27;s loyalty to the republic was questionable, he would have been opposed to his appointment. Blum stated that in May 1940 that he lived &quot;between the cruelest anguish and the most ardent hopes&quot;. Blum harbored hopes that just as in 1914 when Germany was initially victorious, but defeated in the Battle of the Marne that the French and the British would rally to stop the Wehrmacht before it was too late. Instead of heading for Paris as expected, the Wehrmacht headed towards the sea as part of a giant encirclement as Gamelin had sent the best divisions of the French Army along with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into Belgium to resist what he believed to be the main German blow. On 21 May 1940, the Wehrmacht reached the sea, cutting off the BEF, the elite of the French armies and what was left of the Belgian army. Blum used &quot;Le Populaire&quot; to argue that the Allies should break out of the encirclement to link up with the rest of the French armies, but the attempts to do so were unsuccessful. The BEF evacuated from Dunkirk, taking many French soldiers along. After the Dunkirk evacuation which ended with the fall of Dunkirk on 4 June, the Wehrmacht turned south towards Paris. When the government left Paris for Bordeaux on 10 June, Blum was not informed and found himself unable to speak to a person in authority. Blum met with the American ambassador, William Christian Bullitt Jr., and approved of his decision to remain in Paris. In retrospect, Blum stated that it was a mistake for the very popular Bullitt-who had much influence with the French cabinet-to remain in Paris as Bullitt could have used his influence to booster Reynaud against Petain. Blum left Paris and made his way past vast columns of refugees to Bordeaux. On 14 June, the Wehrmacht took Paris.

In Bordeaux, Reynaud favored having the government relocate to Algiers (Algeria was considered an integral part of France) to continue the war while Petain demanded an armistice. The Interior Minister, Georges Mandel, asked Blum to use his influence to persuade several wavering Socialist ministers to back the Algeria option. On 16 June, Reynaud was ousted as the majority of the cabinet rejected the Algeria option and Petain formed the new government with a mandate to ask for an armistice. Blum allowed two Socialists to join Petain&#x27;s cabinet. Petain&#x27;s first act as Premier was to ask for an armistice; Blum did not attach much importance to Petain&#x27;s request as he believed that Hitler would ask for armistice terms so harsh that Petain would reject them and the government would relocate to Algiers. The notion that Petain might actually accept Hitler&#x27;s armistice terms did not occur to Blum at the time. Blum was so convinced that the government was going to Algiers that on 19 June 1940 he booked a passage on the ship SS &quot;Massilia&quot; that was to take the members of &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot; to Algiers. Blum missed the &quot;Massilia&quot; owing to confusion about where the &quot;Massilia&quot; was leaving as he had been told that the port of departure was Perpignan, which was changed at the last moment to Bordeaux. Just after the &quot;Massilia&quot; set sail for Algiers, Blum learned that the government was not going to Algiers after all and that Petain had decided to sign an armistice. Blum was told by the police to leave Bordeaux for his own safety as right-wing extremists were parading though the streets and denouncing those they deemed responsible for declaration of war on Germany, causing him to go to Toulouse, where he stayed with Vincent Auriol. The Petain government signed an armistice that gave Germany full control over much of France, with a rump Vichy government in control of the remainder as well as of the French colonial empire and the French Navy. Blum was in Toulouse when he read the news of the armistice in the &quot;Dépĕche de Toulose&quot; on 22 June, which he remembered as one of the blackest days of his life as he recalled: &quot;I read, literally, without believing my eyes&quot;. Blum thought that the armistice was especially &quot;abominable&quot; because it required the French police to round up and return to the &quot;Reich&quot; all anti-Nazi German and Austrian exiles living in France, which he noted violated the traditional French custom of asylum. One of Blum&#x27;s friends, Rudolf Hilferding, a prominent Jewish Social Democratic leader who had fled to France in 1933 was under the terms of the armistice arrested by the French police and returned to German custody, where he was beaten to death.

Blum spent the next ten days with Auriol and his family, where he refused their counsel to leave France. The Vice Premier in Petain&#x27;s cabinet, Pierre Laval called for the &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot; to meet in the new temporary capital of Vichy (Bordeaux had been assigned to the German occupation zone) to vote to give Petain dictatorial powers. The task of lobbying the politicians was considered to be too vulgar by Petain who assigned that mission to Laval. Blum arrived in Vichy on the afternoon of 4 July 1940. At the Petit Casino, which served as the meeting place for the &quot;informational sessions&quot; held by Laval, Blum later that day engaged in a vigorous debate with Laval who argued that the &quot;mad, criminal war&quot; proved that the constitutional changes he was championing were necessary. In response, Blum stated that it was &quot;France that wanted the war&quot; in September 1939 as he noted the majority of the cabinet had decided to honor the alliance with Poland. During the same &quot;informational session&quot;, Laval told Blum that &quot;Le Populaire&quot; was banned as a threat to public order. Blum noted that he had known Laval since 1915, but on that day in 1940 he had seen him as never before as Laval was &quot;bloated with incredible pride...handing out orders without appeal...visibly trying himself out in the role of a despot&quot;. On 8 July 1940, Blum called for a meeting of all the Socialist deputies and senators to discuss how to resist Laval&#x27;s constitutional changes. Blum noted that to change the constitution required both houses of the &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot; to meet together, which led him to decide that the Socialist deputies and senators should vote against a joint session of the &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot;. Much to Blum&#x27;s surprise, a number of Socialist deputies and senators rejected his plan and agreed for a joint session of the &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot; as they argued that the Socialists should instead ask for a referendum on any constitutional changes.

During the joint session of the &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot; held on 9–10 July in the Grand Casino to debate the request for constitutional revision, Blum found himself deserted by much of his caucus as many Socialist deputies and senators were bribed by Laval to vote for the constitutional changes. Blum was horrified by the extent of the corruption of much of the Socialist caucus who proved all too willing to vote to end French democracy if the bribe was large enough. Other Socialist deputies and senators were terrified by submission by the thugs from Jacques Doriot&#x27;s &quot;Parti populaire français&quot; who were marching outside of the Grand Casino and threatening to lynch any deputies or senators who voted against Petain. Marshal Maxime Weygand appeared at the session to talk menacing about the need for order in France and warned that he would call out the military if the &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot; did not vote as Marshal Petain wanted. Laval in his speech used the British attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir on 3 July 1940 to argue that to vote against Petain was unpatriotic and that Britain was the real enemy of France. Auriol called the Socialists who voted for the constitutional changes &quot;this exhibition of miserable humanity&quot; while saying that Blum was: &quot;too sensitive not to suffer from it. He protects himself against it. He smiles&quot;.

In his keynote speech on 9 July, Laval claimed that the &quot;Front populaire&quot; had weakened France to such an extent that it caused the defeat of 1940 while Blum had sabotaged Laval&#x27;s policy of friendship with Italy, which he claimed caused the war. Afterwards, all eyes were turned to Blum who chose to not give a rebuttal speech. By this point, Blum was too broken by what he had seen that day, especially the corruption of his caucus, to speak in his defense as he later noted that he saw the republic and all that it stood for crumble. Blum found himself very much alone during the joint session as the leading politicians who would have normally spoken in favor of democracy were all absent. Paul Reynaud had been seriously injured in an automobile accident that killed his mistress; Édouard Daladier, Georges Mandel, Yvon Delbos, Jean Zay and César Campinchi had all left France on the &quot;Massilia&quot; and had not been permitted to return; and the courage of Édouard Herriot failed him as he limited himself to defending the patriotism of those left abroad the &quot;Massilia&quot;. When the final vote was held on 10 July, Blum voted against the request for constitutional revision. Blum was among &quot;The Vichy 80&quot;, a minority of parliamentarians that refused to grant full powers to Marshal Pétain. The final result of the vote were 569 deputies and senators for constitutional revision, 80 against and 17 abstained themselves. Of the 56 Socialist deputies and senators who had promised Blum on 8 July to vote against constitutional revision, only 35 (28 Deputies and 7 Senators) actually kept their promise on 10 July. The same Parliament that had sponsored the Popular Front program since 1936 remained in power; it voted overwhelmingly to make Marshal Philippe Pétain a dictator and reverse all of the gains of the French Third Republic.

==Prisoner==

Afterwards, Blum returned to a farm outside of Toulouse, where he wrote and listened to the BBC&#x27;s French language broadcasts for news on the war. In July 1940, Blum ordered a young Socialist politician, Daniel Mayer, not to go to London to join de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French movement, but to go to the unoccupied zone in the south of France to organize a resistance group. On 15 September 1940, he was arrested by the French police on charges of high treason. Despite being unarmed, Blum&#x27;s arrest was treated as a major police operation with dozens of police automobiles parked around the farm while likewise dozens of armed policeman stormed the farmhouse. The excessive police force to arrest Blum was intended to symbolize his status as a man who was &quot;dangerous&quot; to France. Blum was held for the first two months of his imprisonment in the tower of the Château de Chazeron, where his cellmates were Daladier, Reynaud, Mandel and Gamelin. He later wrote that his imprisonment at the Château de Chazeron was at least tolerable as he spent his days writing his memoirs and admiring the Renaissance gardens from his window. Blum began his memoirs with a stark admission of failure as he observed that his generation who come of age in the 1890s had failed to achieve any of their dreams and hopes that they had held as young men and women. In his memoirs, Blum blamed the French &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; for the defeat of 1940 as he claimed that the &quot; bourgeoisie&quot; were selfish, petty people concerned with materialism and their self-interest, which had &quot;rotted out&quot; France. On 8 October 1940, Blum was formally charged with treason. In November 1940, Blum was sent to a run-down estate at Bourassol to be closer to the judicial proceedings at Riom. Unlike the comfortable Château de Chazeron the Bourassol estate was unheated, had no electricity and no running water, which as intended made for a more uncomfortable imprisonment.

On 9 April 1941, Blum received over a hundred birthday telegrams from distinguished Americans, the most notable of whom was the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, which greatly cheered him. In May 1941, Blum wrote a letter to the court asking when his trial would begin as he stated it would have been three months since his last interrogation, and he still had no word when his trial would begin. On 22 June 1941, Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, and Blum&#x27;s confidence began to rise when Germany failed to achieve the expected swift victory. Blum wrote in late 1941 of the Red Army: &quot;Do you recall with what scorn they used to speak to us of that army? Only the Polish Army counted for something. As to a comparison with the French Army, no one would hazarded such an impious thought!&quot; On 16 October 1941, Marshal Pétain in a radio address to the French nation announced that the Council of Political Justice (whose members were all appointed by him) had convicted Blum, Daladier, Reynaud, Mandel and Gamelin of violating article seven of the Constitutional Act and as such were all sentenced to life imprisonment in a military prison. Pétain also announced that Blum, Daladier and Gamelin would be tried before the Supreme Court at Riom. Blum formally protested that it was unjust to be convicted by a tribunal which had not been allowed to present a defense before and was now going to face trial for the offenses he had been convicted of. On 22 November 1941, Blum was then imprisoned in Fort du Portalet in the Pyrenees. The German Ambassador to Vichy, Otto Abetz, wanted Blum to be charged with declaring war on Germany in 1939, a demand resisted by Pétain and his premier, Admiral Darlan, who could not bring themselves to admit to France&#x27;s supposed &quot;war guilt&quot;. Instead, Pétain and Darlan resolved to charge Blum with failure to prepare France for war, much to the disappointment of Abetz. The Fort du Portalet was a remote fortress built in 1838 only ten miles from the Spanish border and Blum&#x27;s cell was cut off from the sunlight. Blum found the winter of 1941–1942 in his cell up in the Pyrenees to be immensely uncomfortable as his cell was always cold and the cell walls were always moist from the humidity. Through visits with his daughter-in-law, Renée Blum, and his mistress, Jeanne Adèle &quot;Janot&quot; Levylier, he was able to maintain contacts with Socialist resistance groups in both the occupied and unoccupied zones. Right from the start, Blum supported the Free French movement led by General de Gaulle.

Blum was put on trial starting on 19 February 1942 in the Riom Trial on charges of treason, for having &quot;weakened France&#x27;s defenses&quot; by ordering her arsenal shipped to Spain, leaving France&#x27;s infantry unsupported by heavy artillery on the eastern front against Nazi Germany. The trial was given much publicity and over 200 journalists, both French and from abroad, attended the trial. In contrast to his cell at Fort du Portalet, the courtroom in Riom was overheated, stuffy, ornate and lavish with Louis XIV armchairs provided for the judges, prosecutors, defense counsel and the accused. Sitting next to Blum were his co-accused, namely Daladier, Gamelin, Robert Jacomet and Guy La Chambre. Blum was visibly angry when at the beginning of the trial Gamelin rose in the courtroom to say that he would not participate in the trial and had chosen to say nothing in his own defense under the grounds he was only a soldier, which Blum found was a selfish act as Gamelin was in effect saying that only the politicians were responsible for the defeat of 1940. Blum believed that Gamelin was hoping that Pétain might pardon him from the expected death sentence to be handed down by the Supreme Court. Blum in his opening address attacked the &quot;legal monstrosity&quot; of having already been convicted without a trial in 1941 for the same offenses that he was now on trial for in 1942 as he stated that presumption of innocence had been disregarded in his case. He also charged it was unjust that the court&#x27;s preview only covered official actions up to 3 September 1939 and thus excluded the actual campaign of 10 May-21 June 1940, which he noted preluded the generals from any responsibility for France&#x27;s defeat. Blum charged his trial was a simply an elaborate excuse by France&#x27;s defeated generals who were looking for a scapegoat to blame for their incompetence. He also noted that court&#x27;s purview started on 4 June 1936, the same day that he took office with the obvious implication that with his government that the neglect of France&#x27;s defenses was alleged to have begun. Blum bitterly noted that it was always the Jews who were everyone&#x27;s preferred scapegoat. Blum&#x27;s opening address made a notable impression on the courtroom as one journalist noted: &quot;No matter how prejudiced they were-and especially against Léon Blum-the audience was moved by his initial passionate eloquence&quot;. He used the courtroom to make a &quot;brilliant indictment&quot; of the French military and pro-German politicians like Pierre Laval. Both Daladier and Blum proved to be highly combative defendants who gave no quarter in their debates with the prosecutors while on the stand. Blum and Daladier charged it was the governments before the Popular Front who had neglected France&#x27;s defense and both emphasized that it was Marshal Pétain had been minister of war for much of 1934 and Laval who been premier in 1935–1936. Blum made much of the fact that his government had launched the largest peacetime defense programme in French history in September 1936, which he used to ridicule the claims of the prosecution that he had neglected the defense of France during his time in office. The trial was such an embarrassment to the Vichy regime that the Germans ordered it called off, worried that Blum&#x27;s expert performance would have major public consequences.

The trial, which received much media attention made Blum into a popular hero. An editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised him, declaring: &quot;When M. Blum was Prime Minister of the French Republic, he may have made errors in judgment. What man in public life hasn&#x27;t done that? At Riom he spoke for the clear-eyed heroic France that every free man on earth loves and respects&quot;. For Blum&#x27;s 70th birthday on 9 April 1942, he received a birthday telegram signed by 200 prominent Americans with the first name on the list being once again the First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The United States maintained diplomatic relations with Vichy France until November 1942, and it was believed that Eleanor Roosevelt was serving as a surrogate for the president. The American ambassador to Vichy, Admiral William D. Leahy, was in contact with Blum, who asked him in a letter dated 30 April 1942 to use his influence with the president to secure his release. Blum was greatly worried about his brother, René Blum, who had been interned in the Drancy camp in December 1941. In September 1942, René Blum was deported to Auschwitz along with a thousand other French Jews, where they were all exterminated in the gas chambers upon arrival. Blum always stated that the death of his brother at Auschwitz was for him the greatest loss of the war. On 8 November 1942, the Germans violated the armistice of 21 June 1940 and occupied the unoccupied zone in the south of France, bringing all of France under the control of the &quot;Reich&quot;. Both Churchill and to even greater extent Roosevelt disliked and distrusted de Gaulle, leading to Blum to write a letter smuggled out of prison in November 1942 addressed to Churchill and Roosevelt that denounced the &quot;deal with Darlan&quot; that Anglo-American forces had made in Algeria. In his letter, Blum wrote that Darlan was a traitor and collaborator, and praised de Gaulle as the real leader of France. Blum wrote: &quot;One serves democratic France by helping General de Gaulle to assume at once the position of a leader&quot;. In March 1943, via a letter smuggled out of prison by Renée Blum, he wrote to General de Gaulle to declare his support, saying as the leader of the Socialist Party &quot;we have from the very first hour recognized you as chief in the present battle&quot;. Blum was transferred to German custody and imprisoned in Germany until 1945.

On 31 March 1943, the German Government had Blum imprisoned in Buchenwald. Without consulting Laval, a group of SS officers arrived at the Bourassol prison on the morning of 31 March to take away Gamelin, Blum, Raynaud, Mandel and Daladier who arrived at Buchenwald the next day. Blum complained of the &quot;peculiar odor&quot; of Buchenwald that reached him as the smell of burned human flesh was overwhelming. Blum described his hut at Buchenwald as &quot;less a prison than a burial vault or grave&quot;. Through Mandel was a conservative, Blum often discussed the future of post-war France with him. As Resistance attacks intensified in France in the spring of 1944, Abetz wrote to Hitler that the executions of &quot;certain French personalities who hold a real interest for the Jews, the Gaullists and the Communists&quot; was the only way to stop the Resistance, a plan that Hitler approved of on 30 May 1944. Abetz suggested executing Mandel, Reynaud, Daladier, and Blum as the men &quot;responsible for the war&quot;. Despite the best efforts at censorship, Blum learned of Operation Overlord as the Allies landed in Normandy on 6 June 1944, which gave him hope that France would soon be liberated. On 28 June 1944, the collaborationist journalist Philippe Henriot was assassinated in Paris, leading to Abetz to order Blum, Reynaud, Daladier and Mandel to be returned to Paris to be shot. In a rare act of defiance, Laval wrote to Abetz asking him to spare the French leaders, and as such it was only Mandel who was taken back from Paris to be shot. Blum remembered that Mandel was taken away very suddenly from Buchenwald, and he never heard from him again.

As the war worsened for the Germans, they moved him into the section reserved for high-ranking prisoners, hoping that he might be used as a possible hostage for surrender negotiations. His future wife, Jeanne Adèle &quot;Janot&quot; Levylier, chose to come to the camp voluntarily to live with him inside the camp, and they were married there. In February 1945, Blum wrote to the commandant of Buchenwald: &quot;You are already conquerors in this sense: you have succeeded in communicating to the entire world your cruelty and hatred. At this very moment your resistance without hope appears only as the extreme mark of a sadistic ferocity...And we respond, waging the war like you, in exasperated rage; everywhere it takes on the face of Biblical extermination. I tremble at the thought that you are already conquerors in this sense; you have breathed such terror all about that to master you, to prevent the return of your fury, we shall see no other way of fashioning the world save in your image, your laws, the law of Force&quot;.

As the Allied armies approached Buchenwald, he was transferred to Dachau, near Munich. On 3 April 1945, Blum and his wife were placed into a convoy of cars that took them to Regensburg camp. Along the way, he saw prisoners on death marches that he noted were &quot;even more lamentable and haggard&quot; then at Buchenwald. On 12 April 1945, he was saddened by the news of the death of President Roosevelt, a leader he always greatly admired and whom he had hopes of meeting one day. Blum had learned from Bullitt about Roosevelt&#x27;s secret, namely that he was paralyzed due to the polio he contracted on a trip to Canada in 1921, and he admired the way that Roosevelt had gone on to become president despite his paralysis. On a more practical level, Blum soon discovered that his SS guards were jubilant over the news of Roosevelt&#x27;s death as everyone in Germany seemed to believe that the new American president, Harry S. Truman, would ally the United States with the &quot;Reich&quot; and declare war on the Soviet Union. The belief, however erroneous it was, that the new Truman administration was about to ally itself with Germany against the Soviet Union reduced the reasons for the Nazis to keep Blum alive as they believed that as a Jew he had certain connections with the Jewish groups that they believed ruled the Soviet Union. On 17 April 1945, Blum and his wife arrived at Dachau, where Blum was shocked by the &quot;living skeletons&quot; that were the prisoners of Dachau. On 20 April 1945, the Red Army entered Berlin, which Blum to hope that the war would soon be over, and fear that the SS would execute him before the war ended. On 26 April 1945, as the Americans approached Munich, the SS guards ordered the prisoners of Dachau to go on a death march. Blum at first thought that he was going to join the death march, but was instead sent south on a truck to Austria. In late April 1945, he was together with other notable inmates, sent to Tyrol. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide in the Fűhrerbunker under the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, which Blum noted seemed to disorient his SS guards. In the last weeks of the war the Nazi regime gave orders that he was to be executed, but the local authorities decided not to obey them. Blum was rescued by Allied troops in May 1945. While in prison he wrote his best-known work, the essay &quot;&quot; (&quot;On a human scale&quot;).

His brother René, the founder of the Ballet de l&#x27;Opéra à Monte Carlo, was arrested in Paris in 1942. He was deported to Auschwitz, where, according to the Vrba-Wetzler report, he was tortured and killed in September 1942.

==Post-war period==
After the war, Léon Blum returned to politics, and was again briefly Prime Minister in the transitional postwar coalition government. On 14 May 1945, Blum returned to Paris for the first time since 1940. The British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden who had known Blum during his time as premier recalled: &quot;He came to see me in London, frail, but with all the natural dignity I had remembered, which no harsh treatment could impair&quot;. Blum praised de Gaulle who proclaimed himself to be the provisional president of France as &quot;the only man who could unite around his name the pure, honest forces of liberated France&quot;, but expressed opposition to de Gaulle&#x27;s plans for a new constitution with an executive presidency. Blum wanted a new constitution, but one that would abolish the Senate and give more power to the premier instead of the president as de Gaulle wanted. In several meetings, de Gaulle attempted to convince Blum to support his plans for a new constitution, but after failing to win him over, his relations with Blum went into a decline. On 22 September 1945, Blum received a letter from Laval who was on trial for his life, asking him to testify in his defense. Blum testified for the prosecution at the trial of Petain for treason, where Blum stated Petain had been the voice of &quot;military defeatism&quot; in 1940, denounced the &quot;corrupting bath of Vichy&quot;, and flatly stated that Petain was guilty of &quot;treason&quot;.

He advocated an alliance between the center-left and the center-right parties in order to support the Fourth Republic against the Gaullists and the Communists. Blum also served as an ambassador on a government loan mission to the United States, and as head of the French mission to UNESCO. Blum paid a two-month visit to the United States in the spring of 1946 where along with the economist Jean Monnet he sought a loan for the reconstruction of war-devastated France. Blum was greeted at the White House by President Truman as an honoured guest, and Blum was a keynote speaker at a ceremony to honor the first anniversary of Roosevelt&#x27;s death on 12 April 1946. On 28 May 1946, Blum signed the Blum-Byrnes treaty that cancelled much of the French war debts relating to Lend-Lease aid; arranged for the purchase of surplus American material at a discount and granted credits on easy terms to buy American industrial equipment to replace French industrial equipment lost in the war. Blum hailed the agreement he signed with the Secretary of State James F. Byrnes as an act of remarkable generosity on the part of the United States, which agreed to support the reconstruction of France without imposing controls on the French economy as the French Communists claimed that it would.

In the talks regarding the future of Vietnam, Blum reprinted a letter from Ho Chi Minh in &quot;Le Populaire&quot; calling for France to grant independence to Vietnam at once, and to recognize the government that Ho had proclaimed in August 1945. He favored the plans for the French Union, the French version of the Commonwealth under which the various colonies of France would be granted the equivalent of Dominion status. Blum praised the agreement for Vietnam to be independent within the French Union that was negotiated in 1946. On 19 December 1946, war broke out in Vietnam as fighting erupted in Hanoi and Haiphong between French forces and the Viet Minh and Blum vowed to put down the rebellion.

Blum supported the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe, and ordered the Socialist deputies and senators to vote for the plan in the National Assembly. In the emerging Cold War, he was a conditional supporter of the Western line as he stated in the states of Eastern Europe occupied by the Soviet Union that the new Communist regimes that were installed were not democracies, and that much of the break-down in relations between the victorious Allies was due to Stalin. However, Blum had hopes that the wartime alliance of the Allies would continue after the war, and felt that some of the policies of the Truman administration were too extreme. He always held to the hope that the wartime spirit of co-operation could be restored, and deplored the breakup of Europe into two blocs, one dominated by the Soviet Union and the other by the United States. Alfred Duff Cooper, the British ambassador in Paris, acting more or less on his own had been pressing for an Anglo-French alliance ever since he arrived in France. Seeing a chance with the Anglophile Blum in office, Duff Cooper arranged for him to go to London. Blum was more interested in British coal as the retreating Germans had destroyed most of France&#x27;s coal mines in 1944–1945, causing many of the French to live in unheated homes in the wintertime, which Britain, which had its own coal shortages could not provide. As a result, the British offered up an alliance as a substitute for the coal that they could not provide. In 1947, Blum strongly supported the Treaty of Dunkirk, a military alliance with Great Britain, which Blum felt gave France what it sought in vain for most of the interwar period, a firm commitment from Britain to defend France. In January 1947, Blum visited London where he received the approval both Clement Attlee and his Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin for the treaty.

After the war, Blum became more supportive of Zionism. Prior to the Holocaust, Blum regarded the Dreyfus Affair as an aberration in French history, but after the Holocaust, he became less certain on this point, and several of Blum&#x27;s post-1945 statements implied it was not entirely possible for Jews to be ever being fully accepted by Gentiles as equals. As a Socialist and an Anglophile, the Labour government&#x27;s policy of enforcing the 1939 White Paper on restricting Jewish immigration to Palestine caused him much anguish. The fact that Ernest Bevin, a politician whom Blum otherwise liked and admired, was the Labour government&#x27;s principle spokesman on Palestine, caused him much dismay. In 1947, he supported the voyage of the ship &quot;SS Exodus&quot; taking Jewish Holocaust survivors from France to Palestine that was stopped by the British, an action that Blum sharply condemned in an editorial in &quot;Le Populaire&quot;. Blum wrote: &quot;The passengers abroad the &quot;Exodus&quot; are not terrorists. They are simply martyrs. They would die with arms in their hands, as heroes, like their fathers and brothers, mothers and sisters, in the Warsaw Ghetto...Pardon the unlucky heroes of the &quot;Exodus&quot;. The ship&#x27;s passengers are not crates that longshoremen can pass from hand to hand, freight to be unloaded indiscriminately in this port or that depot. They are human beings, free individuals&quot;. However, Blum made it clear that he only supported settling Holocaust survivors in Palestine who had no other place to go, and felt that as a French Jew his homeland was France. Blum believed it was possible for the Palestinian Arabs to co-exist with the Jews, writing the &quot;humble Arab peasant&quot; in Palestine was being befriended by the &quot;humble Jewish peasant&quot;. In 1948, Blum supported the establishment of Israel, writing in an editorial in &quot;Le Populaire&quot; on 15 May 1948 that he hoped Israel would be &quot;a fatherland of dignity, equality and freedom for all Jews who had not had like myself the good fortune to find one in their native country&quot;. During the first Arab-Israeli war of 1948–1949, Blum took a strongly pro-Israeli line in his editorials.

Blum spoke in favor of a European federation as the best solution to the problems of Europe, saying in 1949 was needed was to &quot;create Europe while thinking of the world&quot;. On 19 November 1949, he wrote in an editorial in &quot;Le Populaire&quot; that: &quot;we must create Europe. We must do it with Germany and not &quot;for&quot; her. We must do it with Great Britain and not &quot;against&quot; her&quot;. Blum urged the French to forgive the Germans, saying he was opposed to any idea of German collective guilt for Nazism and &quot;nothing fruitful, nothing lasting is built on hatred and enslavement&quot;. Much to his disappointment, neither Attlee nor Bevin were much interested in his plans for European unity. Although Blum&#x27;s last government was very much an interim administration (lasting less than five weeks), it nevertheless succeeded in implementing a number of measures which helped to reduce the cost of living. Blum also served as Vice-Premier for one month in the summer of 1948 in the very short-lived government led by André Marie. He continued to write for &quot;Le Populaire&quot; until his death at Jouy-en-Josas, near Paris, on 30 March 1950. The kibbutz of Kfar Blum in northern Israel is named after him.
