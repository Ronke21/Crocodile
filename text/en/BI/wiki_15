<text>The Can-Am League (CAL), initially the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball, was a professional baseball league with teams in Eastern Canada and Northeastern United States. It is the direct predecessor of today&#x27;s Frontier League (FL), and six teams of the Frontier League today previously played in the Can-Am League. Founded in 2005 in Dayton, Ohio, the league was formed as a reorganization of the Northeast League following the 2004 season.

The CAL operated in cities not directly served by Major or Minor League teams and was not affiliated with either. Though a separate entity, the league shared a commissioner, president, and director of umpires with the American Association of Professional Baseball. The league was headquartered in Dayton, Ohio.

The league ceased operations after the 2019 season, with five of the remaining six teams joining the Frontier League.

== History ==
The Can-Am League was created when the Northeast League was renamed in 2005. The Northeast League was formed in 1995 and played four seasons as an independent baseball league. At the end of the 1998 season, the Northeast League was merged with the Northern League and became that league&#x27;s East Division. Although the East Division did not play the teams that were already in the Northern League during the regular season, the respective divisions played each other in an all-star game every summer and in a league championship series every fall from 1999 until 2002. The Northeast League became its own entity again for the 2003 season and continued play for one additional year before the renaming of the league.

The Allentown Ambassadors folded days before the 2004 season began, forcing the Northeast League to field a traveling team called the Aces. For the 2005 season, the Northeast League accepted the Worcester Tornadoes as a new eighth team. However, three weeks before the start of the 2005 season, the Bangor Lumberjacks folded, forcing the team to create another traveling team, this time called The Grays.

The league operated a traveling team whenever necessary to provide an even number of teams. However, doing so forced the other franchises to host more home games to provide a season of the same length. To obviate such disruptive last-minute schedule changes in the future, the Northeast League adopted a new charter, giving the league new powers to ensure that its franchises were solvent, and renamed itself the Canadian-American Association.

For 2006, the Can-Am League added two teams. Floyd Hall Enterprises, which owned the Jackals, decided to launch a second team after the New Jersey Cardinals franchise was relocated and founded the Sussex Skyhawks. The Skyhawks took the place of the Elmira Pioneers, which moved into the amateur New York Collegiate Baseball League. The league also received a new member from the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, as the Nashua Pride joined as the eighth team.

Another Atlantic League team defected to the Can-Am League for 2007 as the Atlantic City Surf joined. To even out the teams, The Grays were relaunched to serve as the traveling team. 

After the 2007 season, the New Haven County Cutters and North Shore Spirit ceased operations. 

For 2008, Ottawa, which had lost its franchise in the International League, joined the Can-Am League as the Rapidz, an eighth franchise, displacing the Grays.

After the 2008 season, Rapidz management declared bankruptcy. The league declared its intention to operate the Ottawa franchise in 2009. The league changed the team&#x27;s name back to Rapids, a spelling used during the team&#x27;s founding (Rapides in French). Later, however, the Commissioner stated the need for a &quot;fresh start&quot; and opened a contest to select a new name for the team. The winning name was &quot;Voyageurs&quot;.

Still later, the Atlantic City franchise was terminated, as a sale fell through. On March 30, 2009, the league announced that it would shrink to six teams rather than having two league-operated teams.

The Nashua Pride franchise was sold and was known in 2009 as the American Defenders of New Hampshire because of the military tie-ins of its new ownership group. During the 2009 season the Defenders were locked out of Holman Stadium and forced to play their last home games on the road, bringing doubt to the future of baseball in Nashua. The Québec Capitales would go on to win their second League Championship.

On December 19, 2009, league directors preliminarily gave approval to transfer the membership of the American Defenders of New Hampshire from Nashua, New Hampshire, to Pittsfield, Massachusetts for play in the 2010 season. Final approval was granted by the city for use of Wahconah Park on February 1. The ownership group headed by Buddy Lewis had a lease on Wahconah Park for a team in the New England Collegiate Baseball League, and transferred the current lease for play in the Can-Am League. Dan Duquette, current executive vice-president of baseball operations for the Baltimore Orioles, is also part of the ownership group, which is known as Boston Baseball All-Stars LLC. The team was renamed the Pittsfield Colonials.

After the 2010 season, In its place, the league awarded the Rockland Boulders a franchise, added the Newark Bears from the Atlantic League, and formed the New York Federals as a traveling team. Pittsfield&#x27;s franchise charter was rescinded after the 2011 season and the Colonials folded after ownership could not find partners.

The Brockton Rox moved to the Futures Collegiate Baseball League after the 2011 season. At the end of the 2012 season the Worcester charter was rescinded and the league decided to try to find new owners for the Tornadoes, but failed to do so and awarded the franchise instead to a Trois-Rivières, Quebec, group.

Beginning in 2012, Can-Am League clubs played 18 to 20 games per season against opponents from the American Association of Professional Baseball, with which it shares a commissioner. After the 2013 season, Newark announced it would not compete in the 2014 season and the team was eventually folded altogether.

In 2014, the Can-Am League announced that a fifth team, based in Ottawa, would join the league for 2015. The league later announced it would be returning to Sussex County, New Jersey as well, and announced that a traveling team would join the Ottawa Champions and the Sussex County Miners to create a balanced schedule, and continued to include matchups with the American Association. Interleague play ended after the 2015 season, though the Can-Am League continued to send players to the American Association&#x27;s All-Star Game.

Starting with the 2015 season, the league hosted international clubs as part of its regular season schedule. Each of the regular clubs of the league played a series of 3 or 4 games against these international teams and the results of those games counted in the regular season standings. Over the years, the league hosted teams from Cuba, Japan and the Dominican Republic.

On October 16, 2019, the Frontier League announced that it was merging with the Can-Am League for the 2020 season. The Jackals, Boulders, Capitales, Miners and Aigles all joined but did not start play until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing the league to cancel its 2020 campaign. The Champions were not invited, but the Frontier League eventually granted an Ottawa franchise and that started playing in 2022 as the Ottawa Titans.

==Season structure==

===Playoff format===
In its inaugural season, the Can-Am League kept the two-division setup and half-season format that the Northeast League had. The two teams that were leading their respective divisions, designated North and South, at the end of the first half of the season automatically qualified for the playoffs. Two additional playoff spots would be made available. Once again, these went to division winners if the first half champions failed to repeat. Otherwise, one or more wild card spots would be given based on the team&#x27;s overall record in both halves. If absolutely necessary, a one-game playoff would be played in case of a tie.

Beginning in 2006, the league abandoned divisional play. The first half-season leader automatically qualified for the playoffs, as did the second half-season leader if there was a second. To round the field out at four, two or more wild-card spots were given to teams with the best overall season record.

The four qualifiers for the playoffs would meet in two separate best of five series with the winners advancing to the League Championship Series, which was also best of five.

Beginning in 2012, the league stopped using the half-season format. From 2012 through 2014, the teams with the two best records in the league advanced to the League Championship Series. The series was expanded from a best of five to a best of seven. This changed in 2015 when Ottawa and Sussex County joined the league, which enabled it to have enough teams to return to its previous playoff format. From this point until its merger with the Frontier League, the league awarded playoff spots to the teams with the four best records at the end of the regular season.

===Players===
The league salary cap was a maximum amount that could be spent on the entire player roster. Teams could apportion it among players as they saw fit. Certain players were given coaching duties to earn additional pay.

The maximum salary cap for a rostered player was about US$4,500 every one to two months, depending on the roster size. However most players made about $2–3,000 every month. There were some rostered players that made the maximum every two months. There were no players in the league that made more than $4,500 per month.

Rosters were limited to 23 players once the regular season began. An additional two players could be on the disabled list (which was referred to on some published rosters as the disabled/inactive list, and was sometimes used to ensure that a player under contract that a team does not wish to use was unavailable to opponents). League roster rules gave each player an LS (Length of Service) rating, based on the number of full years the player had played professionally: Rookie, LS-1 through LS-5, and Veteran. Teams could carry at most four veterans and were required to carry at least five rookies. Some published rosters stated the LS rating of each player.

===Scheduling===
From 2015 to 2019, all teams played a total of 100 games during the regular season: 50 games each of home and road.

In years when one of the teams was a league-operated traveling team, the franchises played an increased number of home games to keep the total length of the regular season constant. All games a franchise played against the traveling team were played at the franchise&#x27;s ballpark. However, half of those games were designated &quot;home games&quot; for the traveling team, which took the field first and batted last as though the game were played at the traveling team&#x27;s &quot;home.&quot;

Opponents played a series of from three to five games on consecutive days. Occasionally, for clubs near to one another, the original schedule did not put all the games of a series at the same ballpark. For example, the teams could travel to the visitors&#x27; ballpark for the middle game of a series.

<doc id="341888" wikidata="Q702194" url="?curid=341888" title="Xu Xiangqian">
<text>Xu Xiangqian (November 8, 1901 – September 21, 1990) was a Marshal of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). He was the son of a wealthy landowner, but joined the Kuomintang&#x27;s (KMT) National Revolutionary Army (NRA), against his parents&#x27; wishes, in 1924. When the Chinese Civil War started in 1927, Xu joined the Eyuwan Soviet led by Zhang Guotao; Xu became commander of the Eyuwan-based Fourth Red Army. Zhang and Xu retreated to northern Sichuan after being defeated by a KMT encirclement campaign. Xu politically survived Zhang&#x27;s defection to the KMT in the late-1930s; he rejoined the Red Army in a less senior position under the leadership of Mao Zedong.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) Xu served in several military units in Communist-controlled areas across North China, and directed the construction of several bases areas. When the Chinese Civil War resumed, in 1947, Xu was active in North China. Forces under his command were responsible for the capture of the heavily fortified city of Taiyuan in the later stages of the war, in 1949.

Xu was promoted to marshal after the founding of the PRC in 1949. He held numerous political and military positions, and survived the Cultural Revolution despite attempting to moderate some of its more destructive effects. He was an important supporter of Deng Xiaoping and his return to political power in 1976. He continued to serve in a number of political and military positions until he was forced to retire in 1985.

== Early life and military career ==
Xu was born in Wutai County, Shanxi. He was the son of a wealthy landowner and scholar who had passed the Qing civil service examination. He attended the Taiyuan Normal College and graduated in 1923. After graduation he had a short career as school teacher, then despite his parents&#x27; objections, he joined and attended the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy in 1924. After his graduation from the academy he held various officer ranks in the National Revolutionary Army between 1925 and 1927. In 1926 he took part in Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Northern Expedition to recover East China from several warlords. After the campaign was successful he moved to Wuchang, where he taught at a military academy. While teaching in Wuchang he joined the Chinese Communist Party.

After the end of the Nationalist-Communist alliance in 1927 Xu went underground. He did not participate in the failed Nanchang Uprising, but led the failed Guangzhou Uprising shortly after. After that, Xu became active in the Eyuwan Soviet. In January 1931, he became the first commander of the Eyuwan Soviet&#x27;s newly-established Fourth Red Army. The Fourth Red Army numbered twenty thousand soldiers when Xu took command. Later that year, the Central Committee put Zhang Guotao in charge of the Eyuwan Soviet. Zhang purged several top-level officers from the Fourth Red Army who he considered disloyal. Xu sided with Zhang, despite the fact that his wife was one of the people purged. With Ye Jianying as Xu&#x27;s Chief of Staff, he helped Zhang to establish new communist bases and expanded the 4th Red Army to number 30,000 men. While under suspicion and the surveillance of Zhang&#x27;s political commissars, Xu Xianqian lead the 80,000 strong 4th Front Army of the Chinese Red Army in Sichuan to victory against local warlords troops that numbered more than 300,000. Over 100,000 warlord troops were killed in conflicts with Xu&#x27;s forces, and the remaining 200,000 deserted or retreated to other Nationalist-aligned areas.

In 1934 Chiang Kai-shek defeated the armies associated with Zhou Enlai, forcing them to undertake the Long March. Zhang Guotao considered attacking them, but Xu refused. Xu&#x27;s refusal to attack Zhang&#x27;s rivals may have contributed to Mao&#x27;s acceptance of Xu under his own leadership later, after Zhang&#x27;s 4th Front Army was eventually defeated by Chiang. Zhang was purged after returning to the areas around Yan&#x27;an controlled by Mao, but Xu was allowed to rejoin the Red Army under Mao&#x27;s leadership after making an extensive self-criticism. His first position under Mao, as the deputy commander of the 129th division, was effectively a demotion.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), Xu did not remain with the 129th division, but was transferred to several different positions during the war. He briefly spend time with Luo Ronghuan building bases in Communist-controlled areas of Shandong before being transferred to He Long&#x27;s United Defense Army, in which he served as deputy commander. The Communist bases Xu helped to establish proved useful after World War II ended 1945 and the Chinese Civil War resumed. In the early stages of the war, when the Kuomintang forced the Communist headquarters in Shaanxi to evacuate, it was evacuated to the bases established by Xu.

During the Chinese Civil War, Xu participated in several battles in North China. Contrary to the common tactic of many Communist commanders during the Civil War, who favored attacking only after establishing forces of several times the defenders, Luo often engaged numerically equal or superior forces and emerged victorious. In 1948 and 1949 Luo engaged and defeated the forces of Yan Xishan, a Shanxi warlord who was aligned with the Kuomintang.

== Political career ==
After the Communists won the civil War in 1949, Xu served as the General Chief of Staff of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. Xu may not have been active as PLA Chief-of-Staff (1949–54), but was named one of the 10 Marshals in 1955, (the only Northerner to have received this honour) and as a member of the party Military Affairs Committee in 1961. Xu was formally succeeded as Chief-of-Staff by Su Yu, in 1954. He became one of China&#x27;s vice premiers in 1965.

During the Cultural Revolution, Xu was part of the 1967 February Countercurrent, a group of leaders who criticized the Cultural Revolution for creating chaos and undermining China&#x27;s leadership. Afterwards, Mao required him to request a leave of absence and undertake self-criticism. He survived politically, and later that year was allowed to join both the Politburo and the Cultural Revolution Group. In 1969 he joined the Central Committee.

Xu protected Deng Xiaoping when Deng was purged from the government in 1976. Later in 1976 he was one of the military supporters of Hua Guofeng&#x27;s coup against the Gang of Four, which eventually brought Deng back to power and formally ended the Cultural Revolution.

While serving as Defense Minister from 1978 to 1981, Xu advocated developing the People&#x27;s Liberation Army as a well-trained, well-equipped military force and promoted the use of foreign military technology. This view was a departure from Maoist political doctrine, and Xu promoted dramatic predictions of an imminent conflict with the Soviet Union in order to generate political support for his ideas.

In 1978, Xu was almost killed in an accident of Chinese HJ-73 ATGM demonstration when the missile suddenly malfunctioned and turned 180 degrees after traveling several hundred meters, flying in opposite direction toward the observation platform, where Xu and other top ranking Chinese officers were sitting, and landed right in front of the platform. It was fortunate for Xu and the others on the platform that the missile failed to explode, and they survived and remained there until the completion of the demonstration. Xu did not originally plan to attend the demonstration, but because both Ye Jianying and Nie Rongzhen, who originally planned to attend, were hospitalized at the time, (Liu Bocheng had already retired by then to poor health) Xu was invited instead.

Xu led the preparations for PLA operations in the Sino-Vietnam War in 1979.

After resigning as Defense Minister in 1981, Xu remained active in politics. He served in the Politburo and the Central Committee, and was the vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. He was forced to resign his positions, along with Nie Rongzhen and Ye Jianying, in 1985. During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he and Marshal Nie Rongzhen, published statements which, while calling for civil order, warned that the PLA should not resort to bloodshed to suppress the protests.

Xu died in 1990. According to his wishes, no memorial service was to be conducted for him which was refused by the government and he was given a memorial with full military honours. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered across the Dabie, Daba, Taihang Mountains, and Hexi Corridor. His official obituary stated that &quot;his life was a glorious one... Xu was an outstanding Communist, a great proletarian revolutionary, a strategist, and one of the founders of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army.&quot;

== Personal life ==
His grandson is allegedly Xu Lei (徐雷), since April 2022 the CEO of JD.com, however the family relationship is disputed and other sources name his grandson as Xu Luo (徐珞).

<text>Converge, formerly the Baptist General Conference (BGC) and Converge Worldwide, is a Baptist Christian denomination in the United States. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance and the National Association of Evangelicals. The headquarters are in Orlando, Florida. The current president of Converge is John K. Jenkins.

==History==
The Baptist General Conference grew out of the great revival of the 19th century, but its roots can be traced back to Radical Pietism in Sweden. In 1852 Gustaf Palmquist emigrated from Sweden to the United States. Forty-seven days after his arrival, he and three others organized a Swedish Baptist church in Rock Island, Illinois. Fredrik (F.O.) Nilsson, who was instrumental in leading Palmquist to Baptist views, arrived in America the next year with 21 immigrants. Some of these united with the Rock Island church, while others organized a church at Houston, Minnesota. Nilsson traveled widely, founding and strengthening churches. Anders Wiberg was another pioneer among these churches from 1852 until 1855, when he returned to Sweden as a missionary. It also had influence from and a partial connection with fellow Pietists and Radical Pietists of different denominational traditions within the Mission Friends movement. 

Christian experience was a major emphasis among these Swedish Baptists, and they prospered from the awakenings in the 19th century. Immigration, aggressive evangelism and conversion through revivals brought rapid growth to the denomination. John Alexis Edgren founded the &quot;Swedish Baptist Seminary&quot; (now Bethel University) in Chicago, Illinois in 1871. 

In 1879, when the Swedish churches had grown to 65 in number, they formed a General Conference. The members of these churches assimilated into American society and gradually lost their separate ethnic identity. By 1940, most churches were English-speaking. In 1945, the Swedish Baptist General Conference dropped &quot;Swedish&quot; from its name and became the Baptist General Conference of America. Swedish Baptists had maintained an alliance with the American Baptist Publication Society, American Baptist home and foreign missions, etc., and later the Northern Baptist Convention. Some Swedish Baptists expected to merge with that body, but the groups moved toward different developments of theological emphasis. The conservative Swedish Baptists pulled back from growing liberalism of the Northern Baptists, and in 1944 formed their own Board of Foreign Missions. This moved them toward independent existence, which they have maintained to the present. From its beginning among Scandinavian immigrants, the BGC has grown to a nationwide association of autonomous churches with at least 17 ethnic groups and missions in 35 nations.

The Baptist General Conference adopted the new movement name of Converge Worldwide in 2008, and was renamed to Converge in 2015.

==Statistics==
According to a census published by the denomination in 2023, it claimed 1,346 churches and 324,163 members. 

== Beliefs ==
The denomination has a Baptist confession of faith. It is a member of the Baptist World Alliance. 

==Schools==

Converge operates the Bethel Theological Seminary and Bethel University in Arden Hills, Minnesota near St. Paul.

== Missionary Organization ==
The Convention has a missionary organization, Converge missions. 

== Social programs ==
It has a humanitarian organization, Converge crisis response. 

== Notable Members ==

* John Piper - theologian, professor of biblical studies at Bethel University, and pastor at Bethlehem Baptist Church (Minneapolis).
* Bob Merritt - former senior pastor of Eagle Brook Church in suburban Minneapolis-St. Paul.

<text>&quot;Darmok&quot; is the 102nd episode of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the second episode of the fifth season.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship &quot;Enterprise-D&quot;. In this episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is unable to establish meaningful communication with the crew of an alien vessel, which is resolved by the struggle of the ships&#x27; captains to defend each other from a vicious beast. It is often cited as one of the best episodes of both &quot;The Next Generation&quot; series and the entire family of &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series.

The alien species introduced in this episode is noted for speaking in allegories, such as &quot;Temba, his arms wide&quot;, which are indecipherable to the universal translator normally used in the television series to allow communication across different languages. Captain Picard is abducted by these aliens and marooned with one of them on the surface of a planet, and must try to communicate.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; makes contact with a Tamarian ship in orbit around the planet El-Adrel. The Tamarians had been previously contacted by the Federation, but could not be understood — although the universal translator can translate their words, they communicate by using brief allusions to their history and mythology to convey thoughts and intentions. Likewise, the Tamarians cannot understand Captain Picard&#x27;s straightforward use of language.

The Tamarian captain, Dathon, has himself and Picard transported to the planet&#x27;s surface. The Tamarians then cast a scattering field that blocks further transporter use. Dathon utters the phrase &quot;Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra&quot; and tosses Picard a dagger; Picard mistakes Dathon&#x27;s intentions, believing he wants a fight to the death. The next morning, Dathon comes running and Picard realizes there is a hostile predator in the area. Picard begins to understand the Tamarians&#x27; jargon when he recognizes one allegory as a tactic to fight the beast. The two attempt to battle the beast together, but the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s unsuccessful attempt to beam up Picard prevents him from participating at a crucial moment. Dathon is severely wounded.

On the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, First Officer Riker and the crew struggle to understand the aliens&#x27; language. They make several efforts to rescue the Captain, all foiled by the Tamarians. While tending to Dathon&#x27;s wounds, Picard slowly deduces that Darmok and Jalad were warriors who met on the island of Tanagra and were forced to unite against a dangerous beast there, becoming friends in the process. Dathon tried to recreate this event with Picard, hoping to forge a friendship through shared adversity. Picard recounts for Dathon the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, a story that parallels the allegory of Darmok and Jalad. Dathon seems to understand the story but succumbs to his injuries.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; fires on the Tamarian ship, disabling the scattering field, and beams up Picard. A battle begins, but just when mutual destruction seems certain, Picard enters the bridge and uses his newfound knowledge to communicate with the Tamarians, who are overjoyed at the development. Picard offers them Dathon&#x27;s diary and dagger after telling them of their captain&#x27;s sacrifice. The Tamarians tell him to keep the dagger in remembrance of Dathon, and record the incident as &quot;Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel&quot; — a new phrase in their language.

Picard later reads the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, explaining to Riker that studying their own mythology may help them relate to the Tamarians. He mourns that Dathon sacrificed himself in the hope of communication, and wonders if he would have done the same.

==Production==
This episode had the longest gestation period of any episode of &quot;TNG&quot; during Michael Piller&#x27;s tenure, taking around two years to make it to the screen. Rick Berman hated the premise, but Piller thought it was interesting and was determined to make it work. Piller gave it to writer Joe Menosky, who completed the script and focused the story on the idea of two leaders attempting to communicate, as well as using the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; as a plot device.

Primary filming for &quot;Darmok&quot; occurred July 18−26, 1991, on Paramount Stages 8, 9 and 16, as well as on location at Bronson Canyon. An additional day was August 8 for the blue screen unit to film the creature scenes with stuntman Rex Pierson on Paramount Stage 9. Second unit for this episode filmed on August 26 on Paramount Stages 9 and 16. When production for the following episode, &quot;Ensign Ro&quot;, returned to location at Bronson Canyon on August 5, another sequence was filmed for &quot;Darmok&quot; involving Pierson and photo doubles Ron Large and Lanier Edwards. Photo double Dana Vitatoe filmed additional second unit shots on August 28 on Paramount Stage 9.

=== Casting ===
The episode features Paul Winfield as Dathon, who previously played Captain Terrell in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, and Ashley Judd in her debut acting performance. The call sheet dated on July 18 featured an &quot;uncast actress&quot; in the role of Lt. Larson; in the final episode, this role became Robin Lefler, who was played by Judd. She later reprised this character in &quot;The Game&quot;.

==In other media==

A Tamarian appears in &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; with a regular character featured as a crew member of the USS &quot;Cerritos&quot;, Lt. Kayshon (voiced by Carl Tart). Kayshon is shown learning and using Federation Standard as well as the Tamarian language.

==Tamarian use of language==
The Tamarian language and its societal implications, as portrayed in the episode, have received considerable attention, both from fans of the series and also in mainstream media.

Most Star Trek plots used a Universal Translator to avoid language issues, but it failed here, providing conflict. The episode describes a language built upon metaphors and allegories, in which Tamarians cite incidents from their cultural history, to communicate the emotions they feel, their perceptions of situations, and their wishes and opinions about actions. For example, the Tamarian captain Dathon uses the expression &quot;Temba, his arms wide&quot;, to indicate his intent to give an item to Picard, and his motive of generosity and friendly helpfulness, by referencing an event in Tamarian history involving a Tamarian, Temba. Similarly, the expressions &quot;Darmok on the ocean, Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra, Darmok and Jalad on the ocean&quot;, convey a sense of two opposing persons, who arrive separately at an isolated place and, forced to cooperate when faced with a fierce beast, leave together as friends. The expression conveys his intentions and purpose in requiring his crew to transport Picard and himself to the planet (where there is also a dangerous creature), and isolate them there together. At the end of the episode, his diary is read by his crew, and a new piece of language emerges: &quot;Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel&quot;.

In examining this structure as a language basis, Ian Bogost wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that the language had been criticized as unsuited to technical dialogue of an advanced space-faring race (&quot;hand me the ¾-inch socket wrench&quot;), or as metaphor or imagery. In his analysis, &quot;something much stranger&quot; is depicted, since the language as depicted is described as &quot;imagery&quot;, &quot;metaphor&quot;, or &quot;symbolic&quot;, and it seems to prevent any distinction between an object (or event) and its figurative representation.

Bogost suggests allegory as a better term, because in allegory, events are &quot;replaced&quot; by others instead of just referring to other events. Noting that 20th century philosopher Walter Benjamin criticized this use of allegory as flawed and harmful (it replaces real concerns by a fetishized kind of mythology), he then commented that the answer to these points was to be found elsewhere. In Bogost&#x27;s view, the Tamarian language portrayed is neither imagery nor allegory, although it can take these roles. Its deeper structure is an abstraction, a form of logic. There is no need to ask explicitly for a socket wrench, because the reference suggests what should be done, as well as how those involved should organize and execute the tasks involved. He suggests that the better term to describe this language is that it instantiates strategy and logic, and all concerned can then perceive how to follow it with a shared understanding. He comments that in this sense, the term &quot;Sim City&quot; would represent and evoke an entire process and strategy for creating the simulations within that game, and that:

: &quot;If we pretend that &#x27;Shaka, when the walls fell&#x27; is a signifier, then its signified is not the fictional mythological character Shaka, nor the myth that contains whatever calamity caused the walls to fall, but the logic by which the situation itself came about. Tamarian language isn’t really language at all, but machinery.&quot; 

The Tamarians&#x27; language has been compared to the modern use of Internet memes and image macros.

The paper &quot;Darmok and Jalad on the Internet&quot; by Kristina Šekrst builds upon the idea and compares the Tamarian language to Lakoff&#x27;s and Mark Johnson&#x27;s theory of metaphors from &quot;Metaphors We Live By&quot; and &quot;Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things&quot;. It explores how the Tamarian reliance on mythological and historical references mirrors the cognitive linguistics concept that metaphors are not just linguistic tools but fundamental to human thought. By grounding communication in shared cultural narratives, the Tamarian language exemplifies how metaphor shapes not only expression but also the conceptual frameworks through which individuals and societies understand the world. Šekrst highlights the significance of these insights in illustrating how metaphor operates across both human and speculative alien languages, offering an example of metaphor&#x27;s power to bridge or hinder understanding.

Šekrst extends this analysis to consider the implications of metaphorical communication in natural language processing (NLP). She argues that, much like the Tamarian language, human languages rely heavily on metaphorical structures, which present unique challenges for computational models. Drawing from recent advancements in NLP, the paper discusses the limitations of AI systems in grasping the cultural and contextual nuances of metaphor, underscoring the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to understanding both human and artificial cognition.

The book &quot;Hailing frequencies open: Communication in Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; by Thomas D. Parham, III says that in &quot;Darmok&quot;, the episode focused on epistemology by using interpersonal interactions. They found that several other episodes in the series used interpersonal interactions to explore concepts.

Tamarian language was compared to the difficulty of communicating with an autistic 19-year-old patient by Elizabeth Kim et al.

A machine-learning translation by Peter Jansen was employed for English-to-Tamarian translation, assembling a Tamarian-English dictionary of utterances from the original episode and several follow-on novels, as well as an automatic translation system for this language pair.

==Reception==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave it a grade &quot;A&quot;, and although he finds the core concept improbable he says &quot;the episode is carried by terrific performances, particularly Stewart and Winfield&quot;. In his 2012 rewatch, Keith DeCandido of &quot;Tor.com&quot; rated the episode nine out of ten.

The 1999 book &quot;The Music of Star Trek&quot; describes composer Jay Chattaway&#x27;s score as offering &quot;memorable dramatic support&quot; to &quot;Darmok&quot; and other episodes he had worked on.
&quot;Darmok&quot; is generally regarded as one of the greatest episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as well as one of Patrick Stewart&#x27;s best performances as Captain Picard. In 2016, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ranked &quot;Darmok&quot; the second best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; television. &quot;Io9&quot; ranked it as the fifth best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 2011, and again in 2014. In 2016, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it sixth of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes. In 2016, Vox list this as one of the top 25 essential episodes of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;Ars Technica&quot; triggered an online controversy when one staff member said it was a &quot;bad episode&quot;; in the ensuing discussion they noted that overall it is considered not just a good episode, but a great one.

In 2015, Geek.com rated &quot;Darmok&quot; as the fifth greatest moment in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;Darmok&quot; the 19th best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. They call this one of &quot;Picard&#x27;s finest hours&quot; as he tries to communicate with an alien that despite understanding the words (see universal translator), does not understand the meaning. They are stranded together on an alien planet while threatened, and Picard eventually figures out they are speaking in metaphors. A communication breakthrough comes when he relates their situation to the alien&#x27;s description &quot;Darmok and Jalad – at Tanagra.&quot;

In 2016, &quot;Radio Times&quot; ranked the interaction between Picard and Dathon in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as the 20th best moment in all &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked &quot;Darmok&quot; as the third most optimistic and hopeful episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes up to that time. They also ranked the Tamarians, the alien species featured in this episode, as the fifth most bizarre aliens of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. They remark that Starfleet has difficulty in communicating with them due to a failure of their technology, the universal translator.

In 2017, &quot;Nerdist&quot; ranked &quot;Darmok&quot; the fifth best episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

They also listed it as one of the top ten ground-breaking episodes of this series. They note how Picard must overcome the failure of the universal translator technology to communicate with an alien culture. They note how these aliens communicate using stories.

In 2018, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Guide&quot; rated &quot;Darmok&quot; one of the 15 best episodes featuring Picard.

In 2018, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Darmok&quot; as one of the top ten moments of Picard.

In 2020, &quot;Primetimer&quot; ranked this one of the top ten episodes for Picard.

In 2020, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked &quot;Darmok&quot; the third best episode of the series, noting its unique but great take on contact between alien cultures as Picard must contend with failure of &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s universal translator technology. They point out the episode features a &quot;harrowing&quot; confrontation, that features some tense situations as they struggle to communicate.

The future romance between Robin and Wesley&#x27;s character is also noted.
In 2021, Robert Vaux writing for CBR, said that Paul Winfield was a &quot;terrific&quot; co-star for Stewart, and highlighted this episode among a trio of season five episodes (along with &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot; and &quot;The Inner Light&quot;) that he really shined in.

<text>The Florence Y&#x27;alls are a professional baseball team based in Florence, Kentucky. The Y&#x27;alls compete in the Frontier League (FL) as a member of the Central Division in the Midwest Conference. The franchise is one of the oldest current running teams of the league. Founded in 1994, the team was known as the Erie Sailors for their first season. For the next four seasons, the team was named the Johnstown Steal, then the Johnstown Johnnies until 2002, as well as the Florence Freedom until 2019.

The Y&#x27;alls have had the most playoff berths in all FL franchises based in the United States (11), and are third overall amongst active teams in total Frontier Cup championships, behind the Schaumburg Boomers (4) and Windy City ThunderBolts (3). The Y&#x27;alls played their home games at Foundation Field from 1994 until 2004, after playing for 10 years at that facility. They moved into Thomas More Stadium beginning with the 2004 season.

Between the 2001 and 2011 seasons, the Y&#x27;alls missed the playoffs 11 seasons in a row. After that, from 2012 to 2021, they made the playoffs 5 times in 10 seasons.

==History==
The team began in Erie, Pennsylvania, as the Erie Sailors in 1994, before moving to Point Stadium in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in 1995, where it was first known as the Johnstown Steal then the Johnstown Johnnies beginning in 1998. The team won two Frontier League championships in their time in Johnstown, one in 1995 as the Steal and one in 2000 as the Johnnies. The team was sold after the 2002 season and moved to Florence, where it became known as the Freedom.

In July 2004, shortly after the opening of Champion Window Field, contractors began filing liens against the Freedom, accusing the team of not paying for work done on the stadium. Eventually, 33 liens totaling US$4.7 million were filed. In August, Fifth Third Bank sued team part-owner Chuck Hildebrant for failing to repay multiple loans taken out to finance the stadium construction. As part of the lawsuit, it was revealed that Hildebrant had used of land that he did not own as collateral for the loans, and that he had given the bank a forged document as proof of ownership. Hildebrant was later the subject of a federal white collar crime investigation and sentenced to prison in October 2005. The team was sold in November 2004 to a new ownership group led by Clint Brown, who was not associated with Hildebrant&#x27;s ownership group.

In 2005, former Chillicothe Paints manager Jamie Keefe was signed as the team&#x27;s new manager. Keefe led the Freedom to their first winning record (53–42). The team finished tied for second place in the Frontier League&#x27;s East Division, missing out on the playoffs by a tiebreaker. Three Freedom players hit more than 20 home runs in 2005—outfielder Mike Galloway (24), designated hitter Kyle Geswein (24), and first baseman Trevor Hall (23). closer Ted Rowe tied for the league lead in saves with 17.

In 2006, the Freedom had a losing record of 38–50, finishing fifth in the Frontier League East Division.

In 2007, the Freedom again had a sub-.500 record, going 42–54 for the season. This placed the team third in the East Division. Outfielder Reggie Watson led the league in batting average (.357) and steals (20), while also winning the Home Run Derby at the 2007 Frontier League All-Star Game, hosted by Florence. Outfielder Ryan Basham earned the Frontier League Rookie of the Year award, hitting .298 with 17 home runs on the season.

In 2007, Champion Window Field, home of the Freedom, hosted its first Frontier League All-Star Game, with the Freedom&#x27;s East Division winning 11–3. The Freedom&#x27;s Reggie Watson had three runs batted in and was named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. The game&#x27;s attendance of 4,483 set a new attendance record for Florence.

In 2008, the team finished with a 47–49 record, missing a playoff spot by four games. For the first time, the Freedom attracted over 100,000 fans to Champion Window Field, with a total of 106,707 fans for the year.

In early 2008, the Freedom changed their primary colors from red, white, and blue to black, red, and silver.

In 2009, the Freedom opened against the Midwest Sliders of Ypsilanti at home on May 20. Florence opened 2009 with two major changes—FieldTurf instead of a natural grass surface and a new coaching staff. Toby Rumfield became the new field manager, and Freedom alumni Greg Stone, the Freedom&#x27;s all-time hit leader, as hitting coach and Bill Browett as pitching coach.

Clint Brown died in January 2018 after 15 years as team president and owner. He was succeeded by his widow, Kim Brown.

Sale of the team to a group of local investors was finalized July 2019. In October 2019, the new owners announced a rebranding of the team for the 2020 season, dropping the name Freedom immediately. The new team name, Florence Y&#x27;alls, was announced in January 2020. The team takes its new name from the local Florence Y&#x27;all Water Tower.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Frontier League canceled their 2020 season and did not play.

The Y&#x27;alls successfully returned to the playoffs, capturing their fifth division title. However, they lost the first round to the Schaumburg Boomers 3 games to 1.

In March 2022, the Y&#x27;alls and Thomas More University partnered to rename the home of the Florence Y&#x27;alls Thomas More Stadium. As part of the agreement, the stadium will also become the home of the Thomas More Saints baseball team starting in Spring 2023. The team missed the playoffs for the first time since 2018.

<doc id="341895" wikidata="Q2035037" url="?curid=341895" title="Condé Nast (businessman)">
<text>Condé Montrose Nast (March 26, 1873 – September 19, 1942) was an American publisher, entrepreneur and business magnate. He founded Condé Nast, a mass media company, and published titles such as &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

==Early life==
Named after his uncle, Condé Montrose Nast was born in New York City to a family of Midwestern origin. His father, William F. Nast—son of the German-born Methodist leader William Nast—was an inventor who had been a U.S. attaché in Berlin. His mother, Esther A. Benoist, was a daughter of pioneering St. Louis banker Louis Auguste Benoist, a descendant of a prominent French family who emigrated to Canada, then to Missouri. He had three siblings.

Nast&#x27;s aunt financed his studies at Georgetown University, from which he graduated in 1894. During his studies, he served as class president and was a member of Georgetown&#x27;s debating organization, the Philodemic Society. He stayed on an extra year to receive a master&#x27;s degree from Georgetown in 1895. He went on to earn a law degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1897.

==Career==
Nast did not take well to law and, upon graduation, took on a job working for a former Georgetown classmate, Robert Collier, as advertising manager for &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Over the course of a decade, he increased the advertising revenue a hundredfold. He published books and &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; with Robert M. McBride. After leaving &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, Nast bought &quot;Vogue&quot;, then a small New York society magazine, transforming it into one of America&#x27;s premier fashion magazines.

He then turned &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; into a sophisticated general-interest publication, with the help of his friend Frank Crowninshield, who was editor and a major influence for more than 20 years. It published many new and high-quality writers and displayed reproductions of modern art.

Nast eventually owned a stable of magazines which included &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot;, British, French and Argentine editions of &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Le Jardin des Modes&quot; and &quot;Glamour&quot; – the last magazine added to the group while he was alive. While other publishers simply focused on increasing the number of magazines in circulation, Nast targeted groups of readers by income level or common interest. Among his staff were Edna Woolman Chase, who served as the editor-in-chief of &quot;Vogue&quot;, Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley.

==Personal life==

Nast was married twice. His first wife was Clarisse Coudert, a Coudert Brothers law-firm heiress who became a set and costume designer. They married in 1902, separated in 1919 and divorced in 1925. They had two children, including Charles Coudert Nast.

His second wife was Leslie Foster, granddaughter of short-time governor of Wyoming Territory, George W. Baxter. They married in 1928 when she was 20 and he was 55 and divorced around 1932. They had one child.

Between 1932 and 1936, Nast&#x27;s companion was &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; writer Helen Brown Norden.

He was nearly ruined by the Great Depression and spent his last years struggling to regain his early prosperity. Condé Nast died on September 19, 1942, and is interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York. His grave is in Section 25 of the cemetery, near Babe Ruth and Billy Martin.

<doc id="341896" wikidata="Q1850674" url="?curid=341896" title="List of regional districts of British Columbia">
<text>The Canadian province of British Columbia is divided into regional districts as a means to better enable municipalities and rural areas to work together at a regional level. These divisions also serve as the province&#x27;s census divisions.

==History==

Regional districts came into being via an order of government in 1965 with the enactment of amendments to the &quot;Municipal Act&quot;. Until the creation of regional districts, the only local form of government in British Columbia were incorporated municipalities, and services in areas outside municipal boundaries had to be sought from the province or through improvement districts.

==Governance==

Similar to counties in other parts of Canada, regional districts serve only to provide municipal services as the local government in areas not incorporated into a municipality, and in certain regional affairs of shared concern between residents of unincorporated areas and those in the municipalities such as a stakeholder role in regional planning. In those predominantly rural areas, regional districts provide services such as land use planning, building inspection, solid-waste management, and some responsibility for community fire protection.

Most land nominally within a regional district is under the control of the provincial government, or in the case of national parks and offshore waters, the federal government. Indian reserves located within the boundaries of regional districts are likewise excluded from their jurisdiction and infrastructure, and there are varying levels of collaboration between First Nations governments and regional district boards.

Regional districts are governed by boards of directly and indirectly elected directors. Municipalities appoint directors to represent their populations (usually the mayors), while residents of unincorporated areas (which are grouped into electoral areas) elect directors directly. The votes of directors from municipalities generally count more than the votes of directors from electoral areas, and larger municipalities have more votes than smaller ones. For example, both North Saanich and Metchosin appoint one director to the Capital Regional District board of directors, but the vote of North Saanich&#x27;s director counts three times as much as the vote of Metchosin&#x27;s appointee.

==List==

==Historical regional districts==

The first regional district was established in 1965, and the then-final regional district was established in 1968.

The following regional districts were dissolved in December 1995 and amalgamated largely into the newly formed Fraser Valley Regional District:
* Dewdney–Alouette Regional District: consisting of Mission, Pitt Meadows, and Maple Ridge, and unincorporated areas north of the Fraser River and west of the District of Kent
* Central Fraser Valley Regional District: consisting of the modern City of Abbotsford (itself newly formed at the time) and adjacent unincorporated areasSumas Mountain (now FVRD Electoral H), west of Chilliwack and south of the Fraser River.
* Regional District of Fraser–Cheam: consisting of the eastern two-thirds of the modern Fraser Valley Regional District, including Chilliwack, Kent, Harrison Hot Springs, Hope and the Fraser Canyon unincorporated areas.

The western half of Dewdney–Alouette, consisting of Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows, was incorporated into the Greater Vancouver Regional District (now Metro Vancouver). Mission and the unincorporated areas east to the Chehalis River were incorporated into the Fraser Valley Regional District.

This amalgamation took place due to the western part of Dewdney–Alouette having become essentially a suburb of Vancouver and the thought it would be better served by being within Metro Vancouver. The Central Fraser Valley RD would be nearly completely dominated by the newly amalgamated City of Abbotsford, bringing the regional district&#x27;s role into question; similarly, the remnant of Dewdney-Alouette would be dominated by Mission. Given the rapid growth being experienced in the Fraser Valley at the time, which was expected to continue for the foreseeable future, the creation of the Fraser Valley Regional District was seen as the best option.

The Comox–Strathcona Regional District was abolished in February 2008 and replaced by two successor regional districts: Comox Valley and Strathcona.

The Peace River–Liard Regional District was created October 31, 1967, when the regional district system was first being established. On October 31, 1987, it was split into the Peace River Regional District and the Fort Nelson–Liard Regional District, which since has become the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality.

<text>Vogue (stylized in all caps), also known as American &quot;Vogue&quot;, is a monthly fashion and lifestyle magazine that covers style news, including haute couture fashion, beauty, culture, living, and runway. It is part of the global collection of Condé Nast&#x27;s VOGUE media.

Headquartered at One World Trade Center in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, &quot;Vogue&quot; began in 1892 as a weekly newspaper before becoming a monthly magazine years later. Since its founding, &quot;Vogue&quot; has featured numerous actors, musicians, models, athletes, and other prominent celebrities.

British &quot;Vogue&quot;, launched in 1916, was the first international edition, while the Italian version &quot;Vogue Italia&quot; has been called the top fashion magazine in the world. As of March 2024, there are 28 international editions. Eleven of these editions are published by Condé Nast (British &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Vogue Arabia&quot;, &quot;Vogue China&quot;, &quot;Vogue Deutsch&quot;, &quot;Vogue España&quot;, &quot;Vogue France&quot;, &quot;Vogue India&quot;, &quot;Vogue Italia&quot;, &quot;Vogue Japan&quot;, &quot;Vogue México y Latinoamérica&quot;, and &quot;Vogue Taiwan&quot;). The remaining 16 editions are published as licensees of Vogue.

==History==

===1892–1905: Early years===
Arthur Baldwin Turnure (1856–1906), an American businessman, founded &quot;Vogue&quot; as a weekly newspaper based in New York City, sponsored by Kristoffer Wright, with its first issue on December 17, 1892. The first issue was published with a cover price of 10 cents ().

Turnure&#x27;s intention was to create a publication that celebrated the &quot;ceremonial side of life&quot;; one that &quot;attracts the sage as well as debutante, men of affairs, as well as the belle&quot;. From its inception the magazine intended to target the New York upper class by &quot;recounting their habits, their leisure activities, their social gatherings, the places they frequented, and the clothing they wore... and everyone who wanted to look like them and enter their exclusive circle&quot;. The magazine at this time was primarily concerned with fashion, with coverage of sports and social affairs included for its male readership.

===1905–1920: Condé Nast===
Condé Montrose Nast purchased &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1909, three years after Turnure&#x27;s death. He gradually developed the nature of the publication. Nast changed it to a women&#x27;s magazine, and he started &quot;Vogue&quot; editions overseas in the 1910s. Its price was also raised. The magazine&#x27;s number of publications and profit increased dramatically under Nast&#x27;s management. It continued to target an upscale audience and expanded into the coverage of weddings. When the First World War made deliveries in the Europe impossible, printing for the European market began in England which then developed into separate national editions. The decision to print in England proved successful, causing Nast to release the first issue of French &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1920.
===1920–1970: Expansion===
The magazine&#x27;s number of subscriptions surged during the Great Depression, and again during World War II. During this time, noted critic and former &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; editor Frank Crowninshield served as its editor, after moving from &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; by publisher Condé Nast.

In July 1932, American &quot;Vogue&quot; placed its first color photograph on the cover of the magazine. The photograph was taken by photographer Edward Jean Steichen and portrayed a woman swimmer holding a beach ball in the air. Laird Borrelli notes that &quot;Vogue&quot; led the decline of fashion illustration in the late 1930s, when it began to replace its illustrated covers, by artists such as Dagmar Freuchen, with photographic images. Nast was responsible for introducing color printing and the &quot;two-page spread&quot;. He has been credited with turning &quot;Vogue&quot; into a &quot;successful business&quot; and the &quot;women&#x27;s magazine we recognize today&quot;, having substantially increased sales volumes until his death in 1942.

In the 1950s, the decade known as the magazine&#x27;s &quot;powerful years&quot;, Jessica Daves became editor-in-chief. As Rebecca C. Tuite has noted, &quot;Daves led a quiet charge for excellence during one of the most challenging, transformative, and rich decades in the magazine&#x27;s history.&quot; Daves believed that &quot;taste is something that can be taught and learned&quot;, and she edited &quot;Vogue&quot; as &quot;a vehicle to educate public taste&quot;. While fashion coverage remained a priority, Daves also elevated the written content of American &quot;Vogue&quot;, particularly championing more robust arts and literature features.

The Daves era of &quot;Vogue&quot; came to an end in 1962, when Diana Vreeland joined the magazine (first as associate editor, and then, following Daves&#x27;s departure in December 1962, as editor-in-chief). The pair had opposed approaches to editing &quot;Vogue,&quot; and critics said that this led the magazine to a period of &quot;extravagance, and luxury and excess&quot;. Under Vreeland, the magazine began to appeal to the youth of the sexual revolution by focusing on contemporary fashion and editorial features that openly discussed sexuality. Vogue extended coverage to include East Village boutiques, such as Limbo on St. Mark&#x27;s Place, and it included features of personalities like Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Superstars&quot;. &quot;Vogue&quot; also continued making household names out of models, a practice that continued with Suzy Parker, Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton, Lauren Hutton, Veruschka, Marisa Berenson, Penelope Tree, and others.

In 1973, &quot;Vogue&quot; became a monthly publication. Under editor-in-chief Grace Mirabella, the magazine underwent extensive editorial and stylistic changes in response to changes of its target audience. Mirabella states that she was chosen to change &quot;Vogue&quot;, because &quot;women weren&#x27;t interested in reading about or buying clothes that served no purpose in their changing lives.&quot; She was selected to make the magazine appeal to &quot;the free, working, &quot;liberated&quot; woman of the seventies. The magazine changed in terms of interviews, arts coverage, and articles. When this stylistic change fell out of favor in the 1980s, Mirabella was fired.

Well-known fashion photographers for the magazine include:
* Erwin Blumenfeld (1897–1969)
* Cecil Beaton (1904–1980)
* Horst P. Horst (1906–1999)
* Regina Relang (1906–1989)
* Irving Penn (1917–2009)
* Henry Clarke (1917–1996)
* Richard Avedon (1923–2004)
* Peter Lindbergh (1944–2019)

===1988–present: Anna Wintour leadership===
In July 1988, with &quot;Vogue&quot; losing readership and advertising to its rival &quot;Elle&quot;, Anna Wintour was named editor-in-chief. Noted for her trademark bob cut and sunglasses, Wintour attempted to revitalize the brand by making it feel younger and more approachable; she directed the focus towards new and accessible concepts of &quot;fashion&quot; for a wider audience. Wintour&#x27;s influence allowed the magazine to maintain its high circulation, while staff discovered new trends that a broader audience could conceivably afford.

Throughout her reign at &quot;Vogue&quot;, Wintour accomplished her goals to revitalize the magazine and oversaw production of some of its largest editions. The September 2012 edition measured 916 pages, which was the highest ever for a monthly magazine. Wintour continues to be American &quot;Vogue&quot;″s editor-in-chief.

The contrast of Wintour&#x27;s vision with that of her predecessors was noted as striking by observers, both critics and defenders. Amanda Fortini, fashion and style contributor for &quot;Slate&quot;, argues that her policy has been beneficial for &quot;Vogue&quot;, delivering it from what some critics had termed its boring &quot;beige years&quot;.
 Although she has had a strong impact on the magazine, Wintour has been pinned as being cold and difficult to work with. The most recent change, as of early 2024, in &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine is the return of Raul Martinez as global creative editor. As the creative director, he reports to Wintour and oversees the direction for the magazine globally and its visual approach. With both personalities, the magazine could take an interesting turn.

===Healthy body initiative===
May 2013 marked the first anniversary of a healthy body initiative that was signed by the magazine&#x27;s international editors—the initiative represents a commitment from the editors to promote positive body images within the content of &quot;Vogue&quot;&#x27;s numerous editions. &quot;Vogue Australia&quot; editor Edwina McCann explained:

In the magazine we&#x27;re moving away from those very young, very thin girls. A year down the track, we ask ourselves what can &quot;Vogue&quot; do about it? And an issue like this [June 2013 issue] is what we can do about it. If I was aware of a girl being ill on a photo shoot I wouldn&#x27;t allow that shoot to go ahead, or if a girl had an eating disorder I would not shoot her.

Jonathan Newhouse, Condé Nast International chairman, states that &quot;&quot;Vogue&quot; editors around the world want the magazines to reflect their commitment to the health of the models who appear on the pages and the wellbeing of their readers.&quot; Alexandra Shulman, one of the magazine&#x27;s editor, comments on the initiative by stating &quot;as one of the fashion industry&#x27;s most powerful voices, &quot;Vogue&quot; has a unique opportunity to engage with relevant issues where we feel we can make a difference.&quot;

==Style and influence==

The word &quot;vogue&quot; means &quot;fashion&quot; in French. &quot;Vogue&quot; was described by book critic Caroline Weber in a December 2006 edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;the world&#x27;s most influential fashion magazine&quot;: The publication claims to reach 11 million readers in the US and 12.5 million internationally. Furthermore, Anna Wintour was described as one of the most powerful figures in fashion.

===Technological===
Google partnered with &quot;Vogue&quot; to feature Google Glass in the September 2013 issue, which featured a 12-page spread. Chris Dale, who manages communications for the Glass team at Google, stated:

 In the September 2015 issue, technology such as Apple Music, Apple Watch, and Amazon Fashion were all featured within the issue&#x27;s 832 pages.

===Economic===
Wintour&#x27;s &quot;Fashion Night&quot; initiative was launched in 2009 with the intention of kickstarting the economy following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, by drawing people back into the retail environment and donating proceeds to various charitable causes. The event was co-hosted by &quot;Vogue&quot; in 27 cities around the US and 15 countries worldwide, and included online retailers at the beginning of 2011. Debate occurred over the actual profitability of the event in the US, resulting in a potentially permanent hiatus in 2013; however, the event continues in 19 other locations internationally. &quot;Vogue&quot; also has the ability to lift the spirits of readers during tough times and revels that &quot;even in bad times, someone is up for a good time.&quot; The article states that &quot;Vogue&quot; &quot;make[s] money because they elevate the eye and sometimes the spirit, take the reader someplace special.&quot; These fantasy tomes feel a boost during economic distress—like liquor and ice cream and movie ticket sales.&quot;

===Political===
In 2006, &quot;Vogue&quot; acknowledged salient political and cultural issues by featuring the burqa, as well as articles on prominent Muslim women, their approach to fashion, and the effect of different cultures on fashion and women&#x27;s lives. &quot;Vogue&quot; also sponsored the &quot;Beauty Without Borders&quot; initiative with a US$25,000 donation that was used to establish a cosmetology school for Afghan women. Wintour stated: &quot;Through the school, we could not only help women in Afghanistan to look and feel better but also give them employment.&quot; A documentary by Liz Mermin, entitled &quot;The Beauty Academy of Kabul&quot;, which highlighted the proliferation of Western standards of beauty, criticized the school, suggesting that &quot;the beauty school could not be judged a success if it did not create a demand for American cosmetics.&quot;

Leading up to the 2012 US presidential election, Wintour used her industry clout to host several significant fundraising events in support of the Obama campaign. The first, in 2010, was a dinner with an estimated US$30,000 entry fee. The &quot;Runway To Win&quot; initiative recruited prominent designers to create pieces to support the campaign.

In October 2016, the magazine stated that &quot;&quot;Vogue&quot; endorses Hillary Clinton for president of the United States&quot;. This was the first time that the magazine supported as a single voice a presidential candidate in its 120 years of history.

===Social===
The Met Gala is an annual event that is hosted by &quot;Vogue&quot; to celebrate the opening of the Metropolitan Museum&#x27;s fashion exhibit. The Met Gala is the most coveted event of the year in the field of fashion and is attended by A-list celebrities, politicians, designers and fashion editors. &quot;Vogue&quot; has hosted the themed event since 1971 under editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland. Since 1995, Anna Wintour, who is Vogue&#x27;s chief content officer and global editorial director, served as chairwoman of the Met Gala, and is the woman behind the coveted event&#x27;s top-secret guest list. In 2013, &quot;Vogue&quot; released a special edition of &quot;Vogue&quot; entitled Vogue Special Edition: The Definitive Inside Look at the 2013 Met Gala. Vogue has produced about 70 videos about this event for YouTube exclusively, that includes pre-coverage, live reporting and post-event analysis. Met-related video content generated 902 million views, a 110% increase from 2021.

===Music===
In 2015, &quot;Vogue&quot; listed their &quot;15 Roots Reggae Songs You Should Know&quot;; and in an interview with Patricia Chin of VP Records, &quot;Vogue&quot; highlighted an abbreviated list of early &quot;reggae royalty&quot; that recorded at Studio 17 in Kingston, Jamaica which included Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown, Burning Spear, Toots and the Maytals, The Heptones, and Bunny Wailer. In addition to their coverage of historically significant artists, &quot;Vogue&quot; is a source for contemporary music news on artists such as Jay-Z, Eminem, Tom Petty, and Taylor Swift, as well as one that introduces new artists to the scene such as Suzi Analogue in 2017.

==Criticism==

As Wintour came to personify the magazine&#x27;s image, both she and &quot;Vogue&quot; drew critics. Wintour&#x27;s one-time assistant at the magazine, Lauren Weisberger, wrote a &quot;roman à clef&quot; entitled &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. Published in 2003, the novel became a bestseller and was adapted as a highly successful, Academy Award-nominated film in 2006. The central character resembled Weisberger, and her boss was a powerful editor-in-chief of a fictionalized version of &quot;Vogue&quot;. The novel portrays a magazine ruled by &quot;the Antichrist and her coterie of fashionistas, who exist on cigarettes, Diet Dr Pepper, and mixed green salads&quot;, according to a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The editor is described by Weisberger as being &quot;an empty, shallow, bitter woman who has tons and tons of gorgeous clothes and not much else&quot;. However, despite the slight defamation of Wintour and Vogue magazine in general, the image of both editor and high-class magazine were not diminished. The success of both the novel and the film brought new attention from a wide global audience to the power and glamour of the magazine, and the industry it continues to lead.

In 2007, &quot;Vogue&quot; drew criticism from the anti-smoking group &quot;Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids&quot;, for carrying tobacco advertisements in the magazine. The group claims that volunteers sent the magazine more than 8,000 protest emails or faxes regarding the ads. The group also claimed that in response, they received scribbled notes faxed back on letters that had been addressed to Wintour stating, &quot;Will you stop? You&#x27;re killing trees!&quot; In response, a spokesperson for Condé Nast released an official statement: &quot;&quot;Vogue&quot; does carry tobacco advertising. Beyond that we have no further comment.&quot;

In April 2008, American &quot;Vogue&quot; featured a cover photo by photographer Annie Leibovitz of Gisele Bündchen and the basketball player LeBron James. This was the third time that Vogue featured a male on the cover of the American issue (the other two men were actors George Clooney and Richard Gere), and the first in which the man was black. Some observers criticized the cover as a prejudicial depiction of James because his pose with Bündchen was reminiscent of a poster for the film &quot;King Kong&quot;. Further criticism arose when the website &quot;Watching the Watchers&quot; analyzed the photo alongside the World War I recruitment poster titled &quot;Destroy This Mad Brute&quot;. However, James reportedly liked the cover shoot.

In February 2011, just before the 2011 Syrian protests unfolded, &quot;Vogue&quot; published a controversial piece by Joan Juliet Buck about Asma al-Assad, wife of the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. A number of journalists criticized the article as glossing over the poor human rights record of Bashar al-Assad. According to reports, the Syrian government paid the U.S. lobbying firm Brown Lloyd James US$5,000 per month to arrange for and manage the article.

In October 2018, &quot;Vogue&quot; published a photoshoot starring Kendall Jenner who had an afro-like style hairstyle which drew criticisms.

In 2020, the hashtag #VogueChallenge became a popular social media meme in response to the perceived lack of diversity on Vogue&#x27;s front covers. Users of various ages and ethnicities uploaded photos of re-creating famous Vogue covers as part of a campaign to promote diversity in fashion.

===Documentaries===

In 2009, the feature-length documentary &quot;The September Issue&quot; was released; it was an inside view of the production of the record-breaking September 2007 issue of U.S. &quot;Vogue&quot;, directed by R. J. Cutler. The film was shot over eight months as Wintour prepared the issue, and included testy exchanges between Wintour and her creative director Grace Coddington. The issue became the largest ever published at the time; over 5 pounds in weight and 840 pages in length, a world record for a monthly magazine. That record has been broken by &quot;Vogue&quot;″s September 2012 issue, which came in at 916 pages.

Also in 2012, HBO released a documentary entitled &quot;In Vogue: The Editor&#x27;s Eye&quot;, in conjunction with the 120th anniversary of the magazine. Drawing on &quot;Vogue&quot;″s extensive archives, the film featured behind-the-scenes interviews with longtime Vogue editors, including Wintour, Coddington, Tonne Goodman, Babs Simpson, Hamish Bowles, and Phyllis Posnick. Celebrated subjects and designers in the fashion industry, such as Nicole Kidman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Linda Evangelista, Vera Wang, and Marc Jacobs, also appear in the film. The editors share personal stories about collaborating with top photographers, such as Leibovitz, and the various day-to-day responsibilities and interactions of a fashion editor at &quot;Vogue&quot;. The film was directed and produced by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato. In October 2012, &quot;Vogue&quot; also released a book titled &quot;Vogue: The Editor&#x27;s Eye&quot; to complement the documentary.

===Video channel===
In 2013, &quot;Vogue&quot; launched the &quot;Vogue&quot; video channel that can be accessed via their website. The channel was launched in conjunction with Conde Nast&#x27;s multi-platform media initiative. Mini-series that have aired on the video channel include &quot;Vogue Weddings&quot;, &quot;The Monday Makeover&quot;, &quot;From the Vogue Closet&quot;, &quot;Fashion Week&quot;, &quot;Elettra&#x27;s Goodness&quot;, &quot;Jeanius&quot;, &quot;Vintage Bowles&quot;, &quot;The Backstory&quot;, &quot;Beauty Mark&quot;, &quot;Met Gala&quot;, &quot;Voguepedia&quot;, &quot;Vogue Voices&quot;, &quot;Vogue Diaries&quot;, &quot;CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund&quot;, and &quot;Monday&#x27;s with Andre&quot;.

===Books===
Books published by &quot;Vogue&quot; include &quot;In Vogue: An Illustrated History of the World&#x27;s Most Famous Fashion Magazine&quot;, &quot;Vogue: The Covers&quot;, &quot;Vogue: The Editor&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;Vogue Living: House, Gardens, People&quot;, &quot;The World in Vogue&quot;, &quot;Vogue Weddings: Brides, Dresses, Designers&quot;, and &quot;Nostalgia in Vogue&quot;.

===Voguepedia===
Launched in 2011 by Condé Nast Digital, Voguepedia is a fashion encyclopedia that also includes an archive of every issue of &quot;Vogue&quot;″s American edition since 1892. Only Vogue staff are permitted to contribute to the encyclopedia, unlike the VogueEncyclo—hosted by &quot;Vogue Italia&quot;—that receives contributions from anyone. As of May 9, 2013, the site was not fully functional; code still showed in search results and only certain search terms yielded results.

=== Website ===
&quot;Vogue&quot; has also created an easily navigable website that includes six different content categories for viewers to explore. The website includes an archive with issues from 1892 forward for those whom subscribe for the website. The magazines online are the same as those that were printed in that time and are not cut or shortened from the original content.

=== Podcast ===

&quot;Vogue&quot; launched the teaser for its podcast series on September 10, 2015. The magazine announced that star André Leon Talley would host the podcasts, and the inaugural twenty-one-minute podcast was released on September 14, 2015, featuring Anna Wintour. Talley commented that he had &quot;been a longtime storyteller at Vogue and it&#x27;s just another format for telling stories—as at Vogue, we love to tell the story of style, fashion, and what is absolutely a part of the culture at the moment&quot;, hence why the magazine has decided to create podcasts.

=== &quot;Vogue&quot; App ===
The app was introduced on April 26, 2016, as a way for the magazine to become more mobile friendly. The &quot;Vogue&quot; app displays content on mobile devices and gives people the ability to view the magazine content wherever they go. The app has new content every day and people can choose to receive content recommended just for their taste. In addition, the app allows one to save stories for later and or read offline. Lastly, the app provides notifications for fashion outbreaks and for new stories that are published pertaining to that viewer&#x27;s particular taste.

=== &quot;Vogue&quot; Business ===
The online fashion industry publication was launched in January 2019. The new property aims at offering a global perspective on the fashion industry with industry insights. Although sharing the Vogue brand name, &quot;Vogue Business&quot; is operated as a separate business entity with an independent editorial team.
In June 2019, &quot;Vogue Business&quot; launched the &quot;Vogue Business Talent&quot;, a platform that promotes vacancies from international fashion brands and companies with the goal to match professionals with their job opportunities.

In 1955, &quot;British Vogue&quot; launched a supplement for New Zealand. In 1957, the magazine was launched no longer as a supplement but as its own independent edition; however, it was still edited from London. In the magazine&#x27;s early years, its focus was on Britain with readers being encouraged to use British materials, New Zealand clothing would even be flown out to be photographed in English settings.

However, in 1961, when Joan Chesney Frost was appointed editor of &quot;Vogue Australia&quot; and &quot;Vogue New Zealand&quot;, the magazine&#x27;s production was moved to Sydney. Under her leadership, the clothes began being photographed in New Zealand (however, until the mid 1960s, most photoshoots were in Australia). In 1962, Frost resigned and Sheila Scotter was appointed editor. Marie Stuttard (who became the first NZ-based fashion editor of the magazine in 1961) said in a 1983 interview &quot;We were able to choose our own clothes for photography, but they had to tie in with the trends as dictated by the organisation overseas. That was the guiding light. Whatever we did had to be approved by Australia.&quot; Under Scotter&#x27;s leadership, Michal McKay became fashion and beauty editor (replacing Stuttard in 1964); she later became the editor-in-chief of Vogue Singapore in the 1990s.

The magazine also incorporated House &amp; Garden from 1962.

<text>W (or W Magazine) is an American fashion magazine that was launched in 1972 as a sister publication to &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;. The magazine features stories about style through the lens of art, celebrity, culture, fashion and film.

== Background ==
&quot;W&quot; was launched in 1972 by James Brady, who at the time was the publisher of the newspaper (and sister publication of &quot;W&quot;, &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;). The magazine was originally a bi-monthly publication until 1993 when it was relaunched as an oversized monthly publication. 

In 2000 Condé Nast purchased the magazine from Fairchild Publications and in 2019 it was sold to &quot;Surface Media&quot; (later changing their name to &quot;Future Media Group&quot;) and in 2020 it was sold to &quot;W Media&quot; which was created for the purchase of the publication and it now works with operating partners Bustle Digital Group and Mic, along with a group of investors (led by Karlie Kloss).

The magazine is now published six times per year.

==History==
===&quot;Early Years, 1972–1999&quot;===
W Magazine origins lie in a biweekly newspaper, which was spun off from &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;, becoming a large monthly magazine published by Fairchild Fashion Media in 1993. When Fairchilds&#x27; owner – Capital Cities/ABC – merged with The Walt Disney Company in 1997, &quot;W&quot; was one of the publications the new company continued to produce.

===&quot;Condé Nast, 1999–2019&quot;===
titles.

Other controversial cover shoots include Steven Meisel&#x27;s entitled &quot;Asexual Revolution&quot;, in which male and female models (including Jessica Stam and Karen Elson) are depicted in gender-bending styles and provocative poses. In addition, Tom Ford&#x27;s racy shoot with Klein and the accompanying article on sexuality in fashion came as a shock to some loyal readers. During the interview, Ford is quoted as saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been about pansexuality. Whether I&#x27;m sleeping with girls or not at this point in my life, the clothes have often been androgynous, which is very much my standard of beauty&quot;. Klein was also the photographer for the racy photo shoot featured in the August 2007 issue, showcasing David and Victoria Beckham. Bruce Weber produced a 60-page tribute to New Orleans in the April 2008 issue, and shot a 36-page story on the newest fashion designers in Miami for the July 2008 issue.

&quot;W&quot; also became well known for covering high class Western and Asian societies. Many of these society luminaries, as well as the elite of the entertainment and fashion industries, have allowed &quot;W&quot; into their homes for the magazine&#x27;s &quot;&quot;W&quot; House Tours&quot; feature, including famous designers, philanthropists, and cultural icons.

By 2009, &quot;W&quot; was harder hit than most fashion publications by a drop in luxury advertising, with ad pages down nearly 46 percent in one year. Longtime editor in chief Patrick McCarthy retired in 2010 when Condé Nast moved &quot;W&quot; to its consumer magazine group, along with &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot; and &quot;Allure&quot;. Stefano Tonchi succeeded him as the magazine&#x27;s editor in chief. In 2011, Edward Enninful was tapped to take the magazine&#x27;s style directorship. Under Enninful&#x27;s direction, &quot;W&quot; generated considerable attention for its riskier editorial, including the March 2012 cover shot by Steven Klein featuring Kate Moss depicted as a nun as well as another cover featuring singer Nicki Minaj dolled up as an 18th-century French courtesan. For the magazine&#x27;s November 2011 art issue, Enninful collaborated with Steven Meisel on a series of fake advertisements that ran throughout the magazine, including one that featured RuPaul&#x27;s &quot;Drag Race&quot; Season 3 contestant Carmen Carrera hawking a fictitious fragrance called La Femme.

In 2011, &quot;W&quot; participated in a four-episode plot line on the fourth season of CW teen drama Gossip Girl.

Over the years, the magazine cut back its print editions from monthly in 2013 to eight times in 2018.

===&quot;Future Media, 2019–2020&quot;===
In 2018, &quot;W&quot; became one of three publications Condé Nast put up for sale in the face of significant financial losses that forced it to adopt a series of cost-cutting measures. By 2019, it was acquired by Future Media, in a deal the &quot;New York Post&quot; estimated at $7 million. In June 2019, Moonves was named as its first-ever female editor-in-chief, succeeding Stefano Tonchi.

Under Moonves&#x27;s editorship, the magazine underwent a major transition. By 2020, she announced to staff that many were being furloughed and that those who work on online content would be staying on at reduced salaries. The new &quot;W&quot; team finished the biggest Best Performances issue ever. In the first week of January 2020, &quot;W&quot; launched nine covers, a 76-page celebrity portfolio covering 29 celebrities and 20 videos. Additionally, the magazine launched a series of new initiatives and dramatically expanded its digital footprint. They launched &quot;W&quot;’s first podcast, &quot;5 Things with Lynn Hirschberg&quot;, which attracted a broad listener base and included guests like Quentin Tarantino, Charlize Theron, Saoirse Ronan, Greta Gerwig, Noah Baumbach, Nicole Kidman, Awkwafina, and Margot Robbie as a part of the new vision for the brand.

===&quot;W Media, 2020–present&quot;===
On August 14, 2020, &quot;W&quot; was acquired by Bustle Digital Group, Mic, and W Media, a newly formed joint venture led by Karlie Kloss and including Aryeh Bourkoff, Jason Blum, Kaia Gerber, Kirsten Green and Lewis Hamilton. They retained Moonves as editor-in-chief.

==International editions==

A Chinese edition was launched in 2023 under license by MC Style Media; the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief is Mix Wei.

<doc id="341908" wikidata="Q4857635" url="?curid=341908" title="Baptist General Conference of Canada">
<text>Baptist General Conference of Canada (BGCC) is a Baptist Christian denomination in Canada. It is affiliated with the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada. The headquarters is in Edmonton, Alberta.

==History==
The Conference has its origins in the founding of Grant Memorial Baptist Church by Swedish Baptists in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1894. This church planted 4 other churches. The latter founded the Central Canada Baptist Conference in 1905 and became a member of the Baptist General Conference of the United States. Though organized into regional conferences, these churches were also affiliated with the Baptist Union of Western Canada (BUWC) for the first half of the 20th century. The Central Canada Baptist Conference and the Baptist General Conference in Alberta withdrew from the BUWC in 1948 and 1949, respectively. Beginning in 1977, the three districts then in existence - Baptist General Conference in Alberta, British Columbia Baptist Conference and Central Canada Baptist Conference - started exploring the possibilities of working together to evangelize Canada and the world. At the second meeting of the representatives, a recommendation came to organize a General Conference. In 1981, three Canadian Baptist general conferences, members of the Baptist General Conference of the United States, became autonomous from the latter and founded the Baptist General Conference of Canada. 

The BGC churches in Canada are organized into four district conferences (BGC Alberta, BGC Central Canada, BGC Saskatchewan, and British Columbia Baptist Conference) and another region known as Eastern Expansion which includes churches in Quebec, Nova Scotia and southern Ontario.

The Conference is led by a Board composed of members from BGC churches from the districts. The executive director oversees the Canadian office, gives missional alignment to the various national ministries and provides visionary leadership to move the Conference forward.

In 1988, it founded the Canadian Baptist Seminary, located at the Trinity Western University in Langley, British Columbia. 

According to a census published by the association in 2024, it claimed 106 churches.

<doc id="341911" wikidata="Q230303" url="?curid=341911" title="Caroline Kennedy">
<text>Caroline Bouvier Kennedy (born November 27, 1957) is an American author, diplomat, and attorney who served as the United States ambassador to Australia from 2022 to 2024. She previously served in the Obama administration as the United States ambassador to Japan from 2013 to 2017. Most of Kennedy&#x27;s professional life has been in literature, law, politics, education reform, and charity. She is a member of the Kennedy family and the only surviving child of US president John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. 

Born in New York City, Kennedy was two years old when her father won the 1960 presidential election and spent her early childhood years in the White House during his presidency. Kennedy was only five years old when he was assassinated on November 22, 1963. The following year, she and her younger brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., moved with their mother Jacqueline to the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where Kennedy continued her education. Kennedy graduated from Radcliffe College of Harvard University and later attended Columbia Law School, where she earned a Juris Doctor degree in 1988. Kennedy passed the New York State bar exam the following year. She worked at Manhattan&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she met her future husband, designer Edwin Schlossberg. They have three children: Rose, Tatiana, and Jack.

Early in the primary race for the 2008 presidential election, Kennedy and her uncle, Ted Kennedy, endorsed Democratic candidate Barack Obama. She later stumped for him in Florida, Indiana, and Ohio, served as co-chair of his Vice Presidential Search Committee, and addressed the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. After Obama selected United States senator Hillary Clinton to serve as secretary of state, Kennedy expressed interest in being appointed to Clinton&#x27;s vacant Senate seat from New York, but later withdrew citing personal reasons. In 2013, President Obama appointed Kennedy as the United States ambassador to Japan making her the first female ambassador to serve in the country. Eight years later, Joe Biden appointed Kennedy as United States ambassador to Australia and she took office following her confirmation on June 10, 2022.

==Early life==
Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born on November 27, 1957, at New York Hospital to Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy and John F. Kennedy, then a U.S. senator from Massachusetts. She is named after her maternal aunt, Lee Radziwill, and maternal great-great-grandmother, Caroline Ewing Bouvier. A year before Kennedy&#x27;s birth, her parents had a stillborn daughter, Arabella. Kennedy had a younger brother, John Jr., who was born two days before her third birthday in 1960. Another brother, Patrick, died two days after his premature birth in 1963. Kennedy lived with her parents in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. during the first three years of her life. 
=== White House years ===
When Kennedy was three years old, the family moved to the White House after her father was sworn in as president of the United States. Kennedy was often photographed riding her pony &quot;Macaroni&quot; around the White House grounds. One such photo in a news article inspired singer-songwriter Neil Diamond to write his song, &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot;, which he revealed when performing it for Caroline&#x27;s 50th birthday. As a small child, Kennedy received numerous gifts from dignitaries, including a puppy from Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and a Yucatán pony from Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. A short-lived comic strip was created about her, and she was the namesake of the British pirate radio station Radio Caroline, founded in 1964.

Historians described Caroline&#x27;s childhood personality as &quot;a trifle remote and a bit shy at times&quot; yet &quot;remarkably unspoiled.&quot; &quot;She&#x27;s too young to realize all these luxuries&quot;, her paternal grandmother, Rose Kennedy, said of her. &quot;She probably thinks it&#x27;s natural for children to go off in their own airplanes. But she is with her cousins, and some of them dance and swim better than she. They do not allow her to take special precedence. Little children accept things&quot;.When Kennedy&#x27;s father was assassinated in 1963, nanny Maud Shaw took her and John Jr. from the White House to the home of their maternal grandmother, Janet Bouvier Auchincloss, who insisted that Shaw be the one to tell Kennedy about her father&#x27;s assassination. That evening, Kennedy and John Jr. returned to the White House, and while Kennedy was in bed, Shaw broke the news to her. Shaw soon found out that Jacqueline had wanted to be the one to tell the two children, which caused a rift between Shaw and Jacqueline. On December 6, two weeks after the assassination, Jacqueline, Caroline, and John Jr. moved out of the White House and returned to Georgetown. Their new home became a tourist attraction, and the family left Georgetown the following year. They later moved to a penthouse apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side.

===Later childhood years===
In 1967, Kennedy christened the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; in a widely publicized ceremony in Newport News, Virginia. Over that summer, Jacqueline took the children on a six-week &quot;sentimental journey&quot; to Ireland, where they met President Éamon de Valera and visited the Kennedy ancestral home at Dunganstown. In the midst of the trip, Caroline and John were surrounded by a large number of press photographers while playing in a pond. The incident caused their mother to telephone Ireland&#x27;s Department of External Affairs and request the issuing of a statement that she and the children wanted to be left in peace. As a result of the request, further attempts by press photographers to photograph the threesome ended with arrests by local police and the photographers being jailed.

Caroline and John Jr.&#x27;s uncle Robert F. Kennedy became a major presence in both children&#x27;s lives following their father&#x27;s assassination, and Kennedy saw Robert as a surrogate father. However, when Robert was assassinated in 1968, Jacqueline sought a means of protecting her children, stating: &quot;I hate this country. I despise America and I don&#x27;t want my children to live here anymore. If they&#x27;re killing Kennedys, my kids are the number one targets. I have the two main targets. I want to get out of this country&quot;. Jacqueline Kennedy married Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis several months later and she and the children moved to Skorpios, his Greek island. The next year, 11-year-old Caroline attended the funeral of her grandfather, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. Her cousin, David, asked Caroline about her feelings towards her stepfather, and Caroline replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t like him&quot;.

In 1970, Jacqueline wrote her brother-in-law Ted Kennedy a letter stating that Caroline had been without a godfather since Robert Kennedy&#x27;s death and would like Ted to assume the role. Ted began making regular trips from Washington to New York to see Caroline, where she was in school. In 1971, Caroline returned to the White House for the first time since her father&#x27;s assassination when she was invited by President Richard Nixon to view the official portrait of her father.

Onassis died in March 1975, and Caroline returned to Skorpios for his funeral. A few days later, she and her mother and brother attended the presentation by French president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing of the Legion of Honor award to her aunt, Eunice Kennedy Shriver. Later that year, Kennedy was visiting London to complete a year-long art course at the Sotheby&#x27;s auction house, when an IRA car bomb placed under the car of her hosts, Conservative MP Sir Hugh Fraser and his wife, Antonia, exploded shortly before she and the Frasers were due to leave for their daily drive to Sotheby&#x27;s. Kennedy had not yet left the house, but a neighbor, oncologist Professor Gordon Hamilton Fairley, was passing by when he was walking his dog and was killed by the explosion.

==Education and personal life==

Kennedy began her education with kindergarten classes in the White House organized by her mother. Before the family&#x27;s move to New York, Kennedy was registered at Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart. She attended The Brearley School and Convent of the Sacred Heart in Manhattan, and later graduated in 1975 from Concord Academy in Massachusetts. Kennedy was a photographer&#x27;s assistant at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. In 1977, she worked as a summer intern at the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, earning $156 a week ($ in dollars), &quot;fetching coffee for harried editors and reporters, changing typewriter ribbons and delivering messages.&quot; Kennedy reportedly &quot;sat on a bench alone for two hours the first day before other employees even said hello to her&quot;; and, according to Richard Licata, a former &quot;News&quot; reporter, &quot;Everyone was too scared.&quot; Kennedy also wrote for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; about visiting Graceland shortly after the death of Elvis Presley.

In 1980, Kennedy earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Radcliffe College of Harvard University in fine arts. During college, she had &quot;considered becoming a photojournalist, but soon realized she could never make her living observing other people because they were too busy watching her.&quot; After graduating, Kennedy was hired as a research assistant in the Film and Television Department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. She later became a &quot;liaison officer between the museum staff and outside producers and directors shooting footage at the museum&quot;, helping coordinate the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; special &quot;Don&#x27;t Eat the Pictures&quot;. On December 4, 1984, Kennedy was threatened when a man telephoned the museum and stated his name and address while reporting that a bomb had been planted there. Three days later, he was arrested for the threat. In 1988, Kennedy earned a Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School, graduating in the top 10 percent of her class. The following year, Kennedy passed the New York State bar exam.

Kennedy was romantically linked to many famous men, including Mark Shand, Sebastian Taylor, and Jonathan Guinness (of the Guinness family). While working at the Met, Kennedy met her future husband, exhibit designer Edwin Schlossberg. They got married in 1986 at Our Lady of Victory Church in Centerville, Massachusetts. Kennedy&#x27;s first cousin, Maria Shriver, served as the matron of honor, and Ted walked her down the aisle. Kennedy did not change her surname at the time she married. Kennedy has three children: Rose Kennedy Schlossberg (born 1988), Tatiana Celia Kennedy Schlossberg (born 1990), and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg, known as Jack (born 1993).

Raised in Manhattan and somewhat separated from their Hyannis Port, Massachusetts cousins, Caroline and John Jr. were very close, especially following their mother&#x27;s death in 1994. After John Jr. died in a plane crash in 1999, Kennedy was the only remaining survivor of President Kennedy&#x27;s immediate family, and she preferred not to have a public memorial service for her brother. Kennedy decided that his remains would be cremated, and his ashes scattered into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, where John Jr. met his fate. John Jr. bequeathed Kennedy his half ownership of &quot;George&quot; magazine, but Kennedy believed that her brother would not have wanted the magazine to continue following his death, and the magazine ceased publication two years later.

Kennedy owns Red Gate Farm, her mother&#x27;s estate in Aquinnah, Massachusetts (formerly Gay Head) on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. The New York &quot;Daily News&quot; estimated Kennedy&#x27;s net worth in 2008 at over $100 million. During her 2013 nomination to serve as ambassador to Japan, financial disclosure reports showed her net worth to be between $278 million and $500 million, including family trusts and commercial property in Chicago.

In January 2025, Kennedy publicly spoke out against her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&#x27;s nomination for Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, in a letter and video to US senators ahead of confirmation proceedings. Within this letter, Kennedy labelled her cousin a &quot;predator&quot; and stated his views and actions on vaccinations to be &quot;hypocritical&quot; and financially motivated. The letter was also posted on her son Jack&#x27;s Instagram page, and was supported by other members of the Kennedy family.

==Career==
Kennedy is an attorney, writer, and editor who has served on the boards of numerous non-profit organizations. With Ellen Alderman, she co-wrote the book, &quot;In Our Defense: The Bill of Rights In Action&quot;, which was published in 1991. During an interview regarding the volume, Kennedy explained that the two wanted to show why the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution was written. She attended the Robin Hood Foundation annual breakfast on December 7, 1999. Her brother, John Jr., had been committed to the organization, which she spoke of at the event. In 2000, Kennedy supported Al Gore for the presidency and mentioned feeling a kinship with him since their fathers served together in the Senate. She spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention which was held in Los Angeles, California, the first time since the 1960 Democratic National Convention, where her father had been nominated by the Democratic Party for the presidency.
From 2002 through 2004, Kennedy worked as director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships for the New York City Department of Education, appointed by School Chancellor Joel Klein. The three-day-a-week job paid Kennedy a salary of $1 and had the goal of raising private money for the New York City public schools; she helped raise more than $65 million. Kennedy served as one of two vice chairs of the board of directors of The Fund for Public Schools and is currently honorary director of the fund. She has also served on the board of trustees of Concord Academy, which Kennedy attended as a teen.

Kennedy and other members of her family created the Profile in Courage Award in 1989. The award is given to a public official or officials whose actions demonstrate politically courageous leadership in the spirit of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s book, &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;. In 2001, she presented the award to former president Gerald Ford for his controversial pardon of former president Richard M. Nixon almost 30 years prior. Kennedy is also president of the Kennedy Library Foundation and an adviser to the Harvard Institute of Politics. She is a member of the New York and Washington, D.C., bar associations. Kennedy is also a member of the boards of directors of the Commission on Presidential Debates and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and is an honorary chair of the American Ballet Theatre. She represented her family at the funeral services of former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and former First Ladies Lady Bird Johnson, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush. Kennedy also represented her family at the dedication of the Bill Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, in November 2004, and at the dedication of the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library in 1997. Kennedy attended the 50th-anniversary ceremony of the March on Washington on August 28, 2013. 

===2008 and 2012 presidential elections===

On January 27, 2008, Kennedy announced in a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed piece entitled, &quot;A President Like My Father,&quot; that she would endorse Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Her concluding lines were: &quot;I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them. But for the first time, I believe I have found the man who could be that president—not just for me, but for a new generation of Americans.&quot;

Federal Election Commission records show that Kennedy contributed $2,300 to the Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign committee on June 29, 2007. She previously contributed a total of $5,000 to Clinton&#x27;s 2006 senatorial campaign. On September 18, 2007, she contributed $2,300 to Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign committee.On June 4, 2008, Obama named Kennedy, along with Jim Johnson (who withdrew one week later) and Eric Holder, to co-chair his Vice Presidential Search Committee. Filmmaker Michael Moore called on Kennedy to &quot;Pull a Cheney&quot;, and name herself as Obama&#x27;s vice presidential running mate (Dick Cheney headed George W. Bush&#x27;s vice presidential vetting committee in 2000—Cheney himself was chosen for the job). On August 23, Obama announced that Senator Joe Biden of Delaware would be his running mate. Kennedy addressed the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, introducing a tribute film about her uncle, Senator Ted Kennedy. The Topps trading card company memorialized Kennedy&#x27;s involvement in the campaign by featuring her on a card in a set commemorating Obama&#x27;s road to the White House.

Kennedy was among the 35 national co-chairs of Obama&#x27;s 2012 re-election campaign. On June 27, 2012, Kennedy made appearances in Nashua and Manchester, New Hampshire, to campaign for the re-election of President Obama.

There was media speculation that she might become a possible candidate for the 2020 Presidential primaries and election but this did not come to pass.

===United States Senate seat===

In December 2008, Kennedy expressed interest in the United States Senate seat occupied by Hillary Clinton, who had been selected to become Secretary of State. This seat was to be filled through 2010 by appointment of New York Governor David Paterson. This same seat was held by Kennedy&#x27;s uncle Robert F. Kennedy from January 1965 until his assassination in June 1968, when he was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Kennedy&#x27;s appointment was supported by Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, State Assemblyman Vito Lopez, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, and former New York City Mayor Ed Koch.

She was criticized for not voting in a number of Democratic primaries and general elections since registering in 1988 in New York City and for not providing details about her political views. In response, Kennedy released a statement through a spokeswoman that outlined some of her political views including that she supported legislation legalizing same-sex marriage, was pro-choice, against the death penalty, for restoring the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and believed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) should be re-examined. On foreign policy, her spokeswoman reiterated that Kennedy opposed the Iraq War from the beginning as well as that she believed that Jerusalem should be the undivided capital city of Israel. Kennedy declined to make disclosures of her financial dealings or other personal matters to the press, stating that she would not release the information publicly unless she were selected by Governor Paterson. She did complete a confidential 28-page disclosure questionnaire required of hopefuls, reported to include extensive financial information.

In an interview with the Associated Press, Kennedy acknowledged that she would need to prove herself. &quot;Going into politics is something people have asked me about forever&quot;, Kennedy said. &quot;When this opportunity came along, which was sort of unexpected, I thought, &#x27;Well, maybe now. How about now?&#x27; [I&#x27;ll have to] work twice as hard as anybody else... I am an unconventional choice... We&#x27;re starting to see there are many ways into public life and public service&quot;. In late December 2008, Kennedy drew criticism from several media outlets for lacking clarity in interviews, and for using the phrase &quot;you know&quot; 168 times during a 30-minute interview with NY1.

Shortly before midnight on January 22, 2009, Kennedy released a statement that she was withdrawing from consideration for the seat, citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;. Kennedy declined to expand upon the reasons that led to her decision. One day after Kennedy&#x27;s withdrawal, Paterson announced his selection of Representative Kirsten Gillibrand to fill the Senate seat.

===United States Ambassador to Japan (2013–2017)===

On July 24, 2013, President Obama announced Kennedy as his nominee to be United States Ambassador to Japan to succeed Ambassador John Roos. The prospective nomination was first reported in February 2013 and, in mid-July 2013, formal diplomatic agreement to the appointment was reportedly received from the Japanese government.On September 19, 2013, Kennedy sat before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and responded to questions regarding her potential appointment. Kennedy explained that her focus would be military ties, trade, and student exchange if she was selected for the position. On September 30, 2013, the committee favorably reported her nomination to the Senate floor. She was confirmed on October 16, 2013, by voice vote as the first female U.S. Ambassador to Japan and was sworn in by Secretary of State John Kerry on November 12. Kennedy arrived in Japan on November 15 and met Japanese diplomats three days later. On November 19, NHK showed live coverage of Kennedy&#x27;s arrival at the Imperial Palace to present her diplomatic credentials to Emperor Akihito.

====Tenure====

In December 2013, she visited Nagasaki to meet with survivors of the 1945 atomic bombing of that city. On August 5, 2014, she attended a memorial ceremony for victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima; she was the second U.S. ambassador to attend the annual memorial. This was her second visit to Hiroshima, having visited in 1978 with her uncle, Senator Ted Kennedy.

In February 2014, Kennedy visited the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, the site of the large military bases of United States Forces Japan, and was received by protests against the American military presence and placards with &quot;no base&quot; written on them. The protesters are opposed to the American military presence citing various concerns over sexual assaults and the environmental impact of the base. Kennedy subsequently met with Okinawa&#x27;s governor, Hirokazu Nakaima, who was re-elected in 2010 in opposition to the base. She pledged to reduce the burden of the American military presence in Okinawa.

In April 2015, Kennedy visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, which displayed the impact from the 1945 atomic bombing. Kennedy called her visit a &quot;solemn honor&quot; and also planted dogwood trees on a road, participating in a U.S. project to spread 3,000 dogwood trees across Japan.
On August 6, 2015, Kennedy accompanied US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs Rose Gottemoeller to the memorial for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan by the United States in World War II. It marked the 70th anniversary of the bombing, and Gottemoeller became the first senior American official to attend the annual memorial. Kennedy was only the second US ambassador to attend. With representatives of 100 countries in attendance, Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe reiterated Japan&#x27;s official support for the abolition of nuclear weapons.

On August 15, 2015 Kennedy was named sponsor for the second USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; (CVN-79) a &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; class supercarrier named for her father. Kennedy christened CVN-79 on December 7, 2019, the 78th anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Traditionally, a person only sponsors one United States navy ship; however, Kennedy is one of the rare exceptions who sponsored two ships. 

Kennedy resigned as the United States Ambassador to Japan shortly before Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States. She formally left Japan as Ambassador on January 18, 2017. In recognition of her service, Kennedy was awarded Japan&#x27;s Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 2021.

=== United States Ambassador to Australia (2022–2024) ===

On December 15, 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Kennedy to be the United States Ambassador to Australia. Hearings on her nomination were held before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 7, 2022. The committee favorably reported her to the Senate floor on May 4, 2022. She was confirmed by the Senate on May 5, 2022, by voice vote. Kennedy was officially sworn in on June 10, 2022. She presented her credentials to Governor-General of Australia David Hurley on July 25, 2022.

In August 2023, Kennedy suggested the potential for &quot;resolution&quot; and a plea bargain deal, to resolve the extradition proceedings of journalist Julian Assange (an Australian citizen) from the United Kingdom to the United States. In September 2024, Kennedy announced she would leave her ambassadorial position regardless of the result of the presidential election.

<text>William Earl Johns (5 February 189321 June 1968) was an English First World War pilot, and writer of adventure stories, usually written under the pen name Capt. W. E. Johns: best known for creating the fictional air-adventurer &quot;Biggles&quot;.

==Early life==
Johns was born in Bengeo, Hertford, England, the son of Richard Eastman Johns, a fabric tailor, and Elizabeth Johns (née Earl), the daughter of a master butcher. A younger brother, Russell Ernest Johns, was born on 24 October 1895. Johns&#x27; early ambition was to be a soldier and he was a crack shot with a rifle. From January 1905, he attended Hertford Grammar School. He also attended evening classes at the local art school.

Johns was not a natural scholar. He included some of his experiences at this school in his book &quot;Biggles Goes to School&quot; (1951). In the summer of 1907, he was apprenticed to a county municipal surveyor for four years and in 1912 was appointed as a sanitary inspector in Swaffham in Norfolk. Soon afterwards, his father died of tuberculosis at the age of 47. On 6 October 1914, Johns married Maude Penelope Hunt (1882–1961), the daughter of the Rev. John Hunt, vicar of Little Dunham, Norfolk. Their only son, William Earl Carmichael Johns, was born in March 1916.

==Military career and the First World War ==
In 1913, while living in Swaffham, and working as a sanitary inspector, Johns enlisted in the Territorial Army as a trooper in the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment (Norfolk Yeomanry). The regiment was mobilised in August 1914, and was sent overseas in September 1915, embarking on RMS &quot;Olympic&quot;. The Norfolk Yeomanry fought (as infantry) at Gallipoli until December when they were withdrawn to Egypt. In September 1916, Johns transferred to the Machine Gun Corps. While serving on the Macedonian front in Greece he was hospitalised with malaria. After recovering, he was commissioned into the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in September 1917 as a temporary second lieutenant and posted back to England for flight training.

Johns undertook his initial flying training at the short-lived airfield at Coley Park in Reading, flying the Farman MF.11 Shorthorn aircraft. He was then posted to No.25 Flying Training School at Thetford in Norfolk, closer to where his wife Maude and son Jack were living.
On 1 April 1918, Johns was appointed flying instructor at Marske Aerodrome in Yorkshire. The aircraft of the time were very unreliable and he wrote off three planes in three days through engine failure – crashing into the sea, then the sand, and then through a fellow officer&#x27;s back door. Later, he was caught in fog over the Tees, missed Hartlepool and narrowly escaped flying into a cliff. Shooting one&#x27;s own propeller off with a forward-mounted machine-gun with malfunctioning synchronisation was a fairly common accident, and it happened to Johns twice. The commanding officer at Marske was a Major Champion, known as &#x27;Gimlet&#x27;, a name used later by Johns for the hero of a series of stories. 

During this time Johns&#x27;s probationary commission was confirmed. He continued to serve as a flying instructor until August 1918, when he transferred to No. 55 Squadron RAF, at the time part of the Independent Air Force, a section of the Royal Air Force that had been formed for the purpose of bombing targets deep inside Germany. Casualties in the Independent Air Force were high and Johns&#x27; career flying strategic bombing missions was characteristically short, lasting only six weeks. On 16 September 1918, he was piloting one of six DH.4s on their way to bomb Mannheim when his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and he was forced to drop out of formation. He jettisoned his single bomb and turned for home, but was attacked by a number of Fokker D.VII fighters. During a lengthy but one-sided battle, Johns&#x27; observer and rear-gunner, Second Lieutenant Alfred Edward Amey, was badly wounded and the aircraft shot down. The victory was credited to Georg Weiner, the commander of Jagdstaffel 3. Johns and Amey were taken prisoner by German troops: Johns received a leg wound during the battle and was slightly injured in the crash, but Amey died of his injuries later that day. Johns remained a prisoner of war until after the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

After the war, Johns remained in the Royal Air Force, apparently with the substantive rank of pilot officer. His promotion to the rank of flying officer was gazetted on 23 November 1920. Johns worked in central London as a recruiting officer and rejected T. E. Lawrence (of Arabia) as an RAF recruit for having applied as John Hume Ross and thereby giving a false name, but was later ordered to accept him.

By 1923, Johns had left his wife. His RAF commission had been extended a further four years and he had moved to Birmingham, again working as a recruitment officer. In Birmingham he met Doris &#x27;Dol&#x27; May Leigh (1900–1969), daughter of Alfred Broughton Leigh. They later moved to Newcastle upon Tyne when Johns was posted there. Although he never divorced Maude Hunt, Doris Leigh was known as &quot;Mrs Johns&quot; until her death. Johns continued to pay for his wife and son&#x27;s upkeep and for her nursing care (she suffered from acute arthritis).

On 15 October 1927, he was transferred to the reserves. Four years later, on 15 October 1931, he relinquished his commission.

==Writing==
W. E. Johns was a prolific author and editor. In his 46-year writing career (1922–1968) he wrote over 160 books, including nearly one hundred Biggles books, more than sixty other novels and factual books, and scores of magazine articles and short stories.

His first novel, &quot;Mossyface&quot;, was published in 1922 under the pen name &quot;William Earle&quot;. After leaving the RAF, Johns became a newspaper air correspondent, as well as editing and illustrating books about flying. At the request of John Hamilton Ltd, he created the magazine &quot;Popular Flying&quot; which first appeared in March 1932. It was in the pages of &quot;Popular Flying&quot; that Biggles first appeared.

The first Biggles book, &quot;The Camels are Coming&quot; (a reference to the Sopwith Camel aeroplane), was published in August 1932 and Johns would continue to write Biggles stories until his death in 1968. At first, the Biggles stories were credited to &quot;William Earle&quot;, but later Johns adopted the more familiar &quot;Capt. W. E. Johns&quot;. While his apparent final RAF rank of flying officer was equivalent to an army (or RFC) lieutenant, captain is commonly used for the commander of a vessel or aircraft.

Johns was also a regular contributor to &quot;The Modern Boy&quot; magazine in the late 1930s as well as editing (and writing for) both &quot;Popular Flying&quot; and &quot;Flying&quot;. From the early 1930s, Johns called for the training of more pilots, for if there were not enough when war came, &quot;training would have to be rushed, and under-trained airmen would die in accidents or in combat against better trained German pilots.&quot; He was removed as editor at the beginning of 1939, probably as a direct result of a scathing editorial, strongly opposed to the policy of appeasement and highly critical of several Conservative statesmen of the time. Cockburn, however, feels that the government was concerned about being so &quot;expertly attacked&quot; on the lack of trained pilots by the editor of the most widely read aviation magazines in the world, including readers &quot;in the RAF or connected with flying.&quot;

Johns&#x27; opposition to appeasement is reflected in some of his books. For example, in &quot;The Black Peril&quot; (1935) the storyline revolves around German preparations for conquest. Even more advanced in his thinking, for that time, was the story &quot;Biggles Air Commodore&quot; (1937) which alludes to Japanese preparations for conquest of British colonies in the Far East.

Apart from &quot;Biggles&quot;, his other multi-volume fiction series were:
* The 6-volume &quot;Steeley&quot; series (1936–1939), featuring former First World War pilot turned crime-fighter Deeley Montfort Delaroy (nicknamed &quot;Steeley&quot;).
* The 11-volume &quot;Worrals&quot; series (1941–1950), detailing the exploits of plucky WAAF Flight Officer Joan &quot;Worrals&quot; Worralson (who was also the subject of three short stories); these were created at the request of the Air Ministry to inspire young women to join the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force.
* The 10-volume &quot;Gimlet&quot; series (1943–1954), whose hero is the dashing British commando Captain Lorrington &quot;Gimlet&quot; King.
* A 10-volume science fiction series (1954–1963) that follows the interplanetary adventures of retired RAF Group Captain Timothy &quot;Tiger&quot; Clinton, his son Rex, scientist Professor Lucius Brane (who invents a spaceship powered by cosmic rays) and Brane&#x27;s resourceful butler Judkins.
**&quot;Kings of Space&quot;
**&quot;Return to Mars&quot;
**&quot;Now To The Stars&quot;
**&quot;To Outer Space&quot;
**&quot;The Edge of Beyond&quot;
**&quot;The Death Rays of Ardilla&quot;
**&quot;To Worlds Unknown&quot;
**&quot;The Quest for the Perfect Planet&quot;
**&quot;Worlds of Wonder&quot;
**&quot;The Man Who Vanished Into Space&quot;

Johns also wrote eight other books of juvenile fiction, twelve books of fiction for adults, and eight factual books, including several books on aviation, books on pirates and treasure hunting, and a book on gardening, &quot;The Passing Show&quot;.

Unusually among children&#x27;s writers of the time, from 1935 Johns employed a working-class character as an equal member of the Biggles team – &quot;Ginger&quot; Habblethwaite, later Hebblethwaite, the son of a Northumberland miner. However, readers never learn his real given name, and he proclaims himself a Yorkshireman once or twice.

==Personal life==
According to the unofficial blue plaque on the building, he lived in &quot;Thatched Cottage&quot;, Lingfield, Surrey, from 1927 to 1937. From 1953 until his death in 1968, Johns lived at Park House, Hampton Court Road, near Hampton Court in Middlesex.

==Death==
W. E. Johns died on 21 June 1968, aged 75. Shortly before he died he was writing the final Biggles story, entitled &quot;Biggles does some Homework&quot;, which shows Biggles at last preparing to retire, and meeting his replacement. The twelve chapters written were issued privately in 1997. 

Johns&#x27; body was cremated at Kingston-upon-Thames Crematorium, Bonner Hill Road.

==Biography==
&quot;By Jove, Biggles!&quot;, a biography of Johns, was published in 1981, written by Peter Berresford Ellis and Piers Williams. It was republished as &quot;Biggles! The Life Story of Capt. W. E. Johns&quot; (Veloce Publishing, 1993, ).

<doc id="341918" wikidata="Q1383946" url="?curid=341918" title="Parthenocarpy">
<text>In botany and horticulture, parthenocarpy is the natural or artificially induced production of fruit without fertilisation of ovules, which makes the fruit seedless. The phenomenon has been observed since ancient times but was first scientifically described by German botanist Fritz Noll in 1902.

Stenospermocarpy may also produce apparently seedless fruit, but the seeds are actually aborted while they are still small. Parthenocarpy (or stenospermocarpy) occasionally occurs as a mutation in nature; if it affects every flower, the plant can no longer sexually reproduce but might be able to propagate by apomixis or by vegetative means. Examples of this include many citrus varieties that undergo nucellar embryony for reproduction, instead of solely sexual reproduction, and can yield seedless fruits.

== Ecological importance ==
Parthenocarpy of some fruits on a plant may be of value. Up to 20% of the fruits of wild parsnip are parthenocarpic. The seedless wild parsnip fruit are preferred by certain herbivores and so serve as a &quot;decoy defense&quot; against seed predation. Utah juniper has a similar defense against bird feeding. The ability to produce seedless fruit when pollination is unsuccessful may be an advantage to a plant because it provides food for the plant&#x27;s seed dispersers. Without a fruit crop, the seed dispersing animals may starve or migrate.

In some plants, pollination or another stimulation is required for parthenocarpy, termed stimulative parthenocarpy. Plants that do not require pollination or other stimulation to produce parthenocarpic fruit have vegetative parthenocarpy. Seedless cucumbers are an example of vegetative parthenocarpy, seedless watermelon is an example of stenospermocarpy as they are immature seeds (aborted ones).

Plants that moved from one area of the world to another may not always be accompanied by their pollinating partner, and the lack of pollinators has spurred human cultivation of parthenocarpic varieties.

== Commercial importance ==
Seedlessness is seen as a desirable trait in edible fruit with hard seeds such as banana, pineapple, orange and grapefruit. Parthenocarpy is also desirable in fruit crops that may be difficult to pollinate or fertilize, such as fig, tomato and summer squash. In dioecious species, such as persimmon, parthenocarpy increases fruit production because staminate trees do not need to be planted to provide pollen. Parthenocarpy is undesirable in nut crops, such as pistachio, for which the seed is the edible part. Horticulturists have selected and propagated parthenocarpic cultivars of many plants, including banana, fig, cactus pear (&quot;Opuntia&quot;), breadfruit and eggplant. Some plants, such as pineapple, produce seedless fruits when a single cultivar is grown because they are self-infertile. Some cucumbers produce seedless fruit if pollinators are excluded. Seedless watermelon plants are actually grown from seeds. The seeds are produced by crossing a diploid parent with a tetraploid parent to produce triploid seeds. It has been suggested that parthenocarpy could explain the difference in the yields in active compounds of the genus &quot;Cannabis&quot;. 

Some parthenocarpic cultivars are of ancient origin. The oldest known cultivated plant is a parthenocarpic fig that was first grown at least 11,200 years ago. 

In some climates, normally-seeded pear cultivars produce mainly seedless fruit for lack of pollination.

When sprayed on flowers, any of the plant hormones gibberellin, auxin and cytokinin could stimulate the development of parthenocarpic fruit. That is termed artificial parthenocarpy. Plant hormones are seldom used commercially to produce parthenocarpic fruit. Home gardeners sometimes spray their tomatoes with an auxin to assure fruit production.

Some parthenocarpic cultivars have been developed as genetically modified organisms.

== Misconceptions ==
* Most commercial seedless grape cultivars, such as &#x27;Thompson Seedless&#x27;, are seedless not because of parthenocarpy but because of stenospermocarpy.
* Parthenocarpy is sometimes claimed to be the equivalent of parthenogenesis in animals. That is incorrect because parthenogenesis is a method of asexual reproduction, with embryo formation without fertilization, and parthenocarpy involves fruit formation, without seed formation. The plant equivalent of parthenogenesis is apomixis.

<text>The Ogooué (or Ogowe), also known as the Nazareth River, some long, is the principal river of Gabon in west-central Africa and the fourth largest river in Africa by volume of discharge, trailing only the Congo, Kasai and Niger. Its watershed drains nearly the entire country of Gabon, with some tributaries reaching into the Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea.

==Geography==
===Course===
The source of the Ogooué River was discovered in 1894 by Mary Kingsley, an English explorer who travelled up the banks by steamboat and canoe. The river rises in the northwest of the Bateke Plateaux near Kengue, Republic of Congo. It runs northwest, and enters Gabon near Boumango. Poubara Falls are near Maulongo. From Lastoursville up to Ndjole, the Ogooué is non-navigable due to rapids. From the latter city, it runs west, and enters the Gulf of Guinea near Ozouri, south of Port Gentil. The Ogowe Delta is quite large, about 100 km long and 100 km wide.

===Delta===
A 30,000 ha site in the delta of the Ogooué River, including much of Mandji Island, has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of many bird species.

===Basin===
The Ogooué Basin is , of which or 73 percent lies within Gabon. It mostly consists of undisturbed rainforest with some savanna grassland where the mid-year dry season is longest. It is home to a high biodiversity. All three species of African crocodile, for instance, occur in the river: the Nile crocodile, the dwarf crocodile, and the slender-snouted crocodile. It is also the type locality for the catfish &quot;Synodontis acanthoperca&quot;.

The Mpassa River is a tributary of the Ogooué River. The Ndjoumou River is the main tributary of Mpassa River.

== Economy ==
The Ogooué is navigable from Ndjole to the sea. It is used to bring wood to the Port Gentil Harbour.

The Ogowe Basin includes several major conservation reserves, including Lope National Park.

The catchment area has an average population density of 4 people per km². Towns along the river include Ayem, Adané, Loanda, Lambaréné, Ndjole, Booué, Kankan, Maulongo, Mboungou-Mbadouma, Ndoro, Lastoursville, Moanda, and Franceville near the Congo border.

Towns in Congo include Zanaga.

The first European explorer to trace the river to its source was Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, who traveled in the area in the 1870s. 

===Tributaries===


The Ogowe River receives water of numerous tributaries including:

* Abanga, which rises in the Cristal Mountains, near Medouneu
* Baniaka
* Dilo
* Iyinda, the most important tributary
* Letili
* Lassio
* Lebombi
* Lekabi
* Lekedi
* Lekoni, which flows across Akieni and Leconi
* Letili
* Leyou
* Lolo
* Mbine
* Ngolo
* Ngounie
* Nke
* Offoue
* Okano, whose main tributary is the Lara River
* Mpassa, which flows across Franceville
* Sebe, which flows past Okondja
* Wagny

===List of major tributaries===

<text>U.S. Highway 181 is a south–north U.S. Highway located entirely in the state of Texas. Both termini are at Interstate 37, the road that it mainly parallels to the east. US 181 begins in Corpus Christi, Texas at mile marker 0 to the south, through south-central Texas to just south of San Antonio to the north (mile marker 131), for a total length of 137 miles (220 km).

The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is at an intersection with Interstate 37 one mile (1.6 km) south of San Antonio&#x27;s Interstate 410 loop, about 12 miles (19 km) northwest of Floresville. Prior to the Interstate era, US 181 traveled into Downtown San Antonio along Presa St. to an intersection with its parent route, US 81, which then ran along Alamo St.

Its southern terminus is in Corpus Christi, Texas at Interstate 37 near the Gulf of Mexico. I-37 and US 181 have mutual termini, such that traffic traveling southbound on I-37 will automatically merge onto northbound US 181, and vice versa.

==Route description==
Proceeding northbound, US 181 runs through the following Texas counties: Nueces, San Patricio, Bee, Karnes, Wilson, and Bexar. At its southern terminus with Interstate 37 in Corpus Christi, TX, US 181 traverses as a freeway in the northeast direction across Harbor Bridge and the Nueces Bay Causeway, before entering Portland, TX. Past the Nueces Bay Causeway through Portland, US 181 shares a duplex with Texas State Highway 35.

Immediately after Portland is Gregory, where US 181 and TX 35 splits, and the freeway portion of US 181 ends. SH 35 proceeds eastbound to Aransas Pass and Rockport while US 181 proceeds northwest towards Taft and Sinton. US 181 shares a duplex with SH 188 and US 77 Business in Sinton, and makes a right turn at San Patricio Street, proceeding northbound.

North of Sinton, US 181 passes through the towns of St. Paul, Papalote, and Skidmore, before reaching Beeville. US 181 business runs through downtown Beeville while drivers passing by can use the US 181 freeway bypass on the east side of town. In Beeville, US 181 intersects with US 59 (Future I-69W) (northbound to Victoria/Houston &amp; southbound to Laredo).

North of Beeville US 181 passes through a number of unincorporated towns including Normanna, Pettus, and Tuleta before reaching Kenedy. US 181 business serves downtown while US 181 runs on the west side of town. Immediately north of Kenedy is Karnes City, where US 181 business runs parallel again east of US 181 through Karnes City.

North of Karnes City US 181 passes through Hobson (unincorporated), followed by Falls City, Poth, and Floresville. US 181 business runs west of US 181 through downtown Floresville.

North of Floresville US 181 passes through the town limits of Elmendorf before intersection with State Loop 1604 (Anderson Loop, surrounding San Antonio), and ends 8 miles north at its northern terminus at I-37, just south of I-37 and I-410 on San Antonio&#x27;s far south side.

==History==
US 181 is one of the original routes accepted by AASHO (now-AASHTO) in November 1926. Its original northern terminus was at a junction with its parent, US 81, and US 90 in Downtown San Antonio. By 1968, the portion between Downtown and Loop 13 had been removed from the state highway system. The completion of I-37 in San Antonio during the 1970s resulted in the truncation of US 181 to its interchange with that freeway, although the AASHTO route log in 1989 stated that US 181 extended northward along I-37 to a common northern terminus at I-35/US 281. The segment north of this point along Presa Street was transferred to Spur 122.

==Future==
In 2003, TXDOT began planning to replace the existing Corpus Christi Harbor Bridge due to maintenance and safety issues as well as to provide long term access to the Port of Corpus Christi to larger ship vessels (including Panamax). Construction has begun to replace the bridge with the New Harbor Bridge, which will be a cable-stayed bridge compared to the current through arch bridge. The alignment of the new bridge. which is west of the old bridge, would begin at the northern terminus of SH 286 (exit 1C on I-37) and cross the Corpus Christi Ship Channel before merging with the current US 181 alignment. Once completed, the Corpus Christi Harbor Bridge will be demolished, and US 181 will be rerouted onto the new bridge. Groundbreaking on construction took place on August 8, 2016 and was scheduled to be completed by the spring of 2020, but was extensively delayed due to engineering and design issues, and is tentatively planned to be completed in 2025.

==Major intersections==























==Auxiliary routes==
US 181 has business routes in Beeville, Kenedy, and Karnes City. The routes are previous alignments of US 181 through these cities, and were previously designated in the state highway system with other route numbers. The designations were changed to Business US 181 by TxDOT in 1991. A &quot;de facto&quot; fourth route, along a former alignment through Floresville, is designated Loop 181.

===Beeville business route===

Business US 181 in Beeville travels through central Beeville while mainline US 181 uses a freeway bypass to the east of the city. It is officially designated by TxDOT as Business US 181-J, and was designated as Loop 516 on May 31, 1973 (which was signed as a business route of US 181), but was changed to Business US 181-J on June 21, 1990.

===Kenedy business route===
Business US 181 in Kenedy travels through central Kenedy while mainline US 181 passes to the west of the city. It is officially inventoried by TxDOT as two separate routes, with a discontinuity at SH 72.

*The southern segment, from US 181 northward to SH 72, is designated as Business US 181-G, and was formerly Spur 259 from September 25, 1952 until June 21, 1990, but was signed as business US 181.

*The northern segment, from SH 72 northward to US 181, is designated as Business US 181-F, and was formerly Spur 258 from September 25, 1952 until June 21, 1990, but was signed as business US 181.
Although not officially concurrent with SH 72, the signage in the area directs traffic from one segment to the other, effectively completing the loop.

===Karnes City business route===
Business US 181 in Karnes City travels northward and then westward through central Karnes City while mainline US 181 skirts the southwestern edge of the city. It is officially inventoried by TxDOT as two separate routes, which connect at the intersection with SH 80 / SH 123 in the east side of the city.
*The southern segment, from US 181 northward to SH 80/123, is designated as Business US 181-E. The route was previously part of SH 80, but it still signed as SH 80/123 to facilitate access to SH 80/123 for traffic from northbound US 181.
*The northern segment, from SH 80/123 westward to US 181, is designated as Business US 181-D. The route was previously part of FM 1144.

===Floresville Loop 181===
US 181&#x27;s former alignment in Floresville is inventoried as Loop 181 by TxDOT. The route was designated on October 15, 1946 when US 181 was realigned to the east. The route begins north of the city limits; within the city, it has a brief concurrency with FM 536 and intersects SH 97 before rejoining US 181 in the southeastern section of the city.

<doc id="341943" wikidata="Q125888" url="?curid=341943" title="Lake Albert (Africa)">
<text>Lake Albert, originally known as Lake Mwitanzige by the Banyoro, Nam Ovoyo Bonyo by the Alur, and temporarily as Lake Mobutu Sese Seko, is a lake located in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is Africa&#x27;s seventh-largest lake and the second biggest of Uganda&#x27;s Great Lakes.

==Geography==
Lake Albert is located on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is the northernmost of the chain of lakes in the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift.

It is about long and across at its widest, with a maximum depth of , and a surface elevation of above sea level.

Lake Albert is part of the complicated system of the upper Nile. Its main sources are the White Nile, ultimately coming from Lake Victoria to the southeast, and the Semliki River, which issues from Lake Edward to the southwest. The water of the Victoria Nile is much less saline than that of Lake Albert. The lake&#x27;s outlet, at its northernmost tip, is the Albert Nile section of the White Nile. The river later becomes known as the Mountain Nile when its course enters South Sudan.

At the southern end of the lake, where the Semliki comes in, there are swamps. The Rwenzori Mountains are to the south of the lake and to the northwest, the Blue Mountains. The few settlements along the shore include Butiaba and Pakwach.

==Water characteristics==
Unlike the very deep Lake Malawi, Lake Tanganyika and Lake Kivu, Lake Albert&#x27;s water temperature is relatively stable throughout, typically around , and even its deeper sections contain oxygen.

The water has a pH of around or just below 9 and an electric conductivity of around 720–780 μS/cm. These are both very high for a freshwater lake but nevertheless lower than Lake Edward.

==Animals==
Lake Albert is home to many aquatic and semi-aquatic animals like hippopotamuses, Uganda kob antelopes, Nile crocodiles, Nile monitors, African softshell turtles, Central African mud turtles, Williams&#x27; mud turtles, various semi-aquatic snakes and various frogs. Water birds are numerous and include pelicans, herons and the rare shoebill.

=== Fish and fishing ===
There are 55 fish species in Lake Albert. Except for Nile crocodiles, the largest predator in the lake is the Nile perch (native; unlike in other Rift Valley lakes where introduced and invasive). Other large predatory fish include the elongate tigerfish, African tigerfish, marbled lungfish, cornish jack, &quot;Bagrus docmak&quot;, African sharptooth catfish and vundu catfish. In addition, there are important fisheries for the Nile tilapia, Niger barb, Albert lates, electric catfish and giraffe catfish that are caught by standard fishing methods, and the small &quot;Brycinus nurse&quot; and &quot;Engraulicypris bredoi&quot; that mainly are caught by light fishing. As much as 30% of the fish production in Uganda is from Lake Albert.

Lake Albert has fewer endemics than the other African Great Lakes. Although the Albert Nile–the section of the Nile that leaves Lake Albert—has several rapids in the Nimule region, these have not effectively isolated the lake from the main Nile sections. In contrast, Lake Edward (and ultimately Lake George) is effectively isolated from Lake Albert by the rapids on the Semliki River, while Lake Kyoga (and ultimately Lake Victoria) is effectively isolated from Lake Albert by the Murchison Falls on the Victoria Nile. As a consequence, most of Lake Albert&#x27;s fish are widespread riverine species also found in the main Nile sections. There are few haplochromine cichlids; a group that is very diverse in other Rift Valley lakes. Of the six haplochromines in Lake Albert, four are endemic (&quot;Haplochromis albertianus&quot;, &quot;H. avium&quot;, &quot;H. bullatus&quot; and &quot;H. mahagiensis&quot;) and two are also found in the Nile (&quot;H. loati&quot; and &quot;Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor&quot;). In comparison, most of the more than 60 haplochromines in Lake Edward–George and most of the roughly 600 haplochromines in Lake Victoria–Kyoga are endemic. The only other endemic fish species in Lake Albert are the small cyprinid &quot;Engraulicypris bredoi&quot; and the endangered Albert lates.

==History==
Lake Albert is still known as Mwitanzige by the Banyoro and Batooro, and Nam Ovoyo Bonyo by the Alur as well as other peoples who have inhabited the region for centuries before the colonial age. This name means ‘locust killer’, from &quot;omwita&quot; ‘killer’ and &quot;enzige&quot; ‘locusts’ in the Runyoro language, and &#x27;The Lake that has defeated the locusts&#x27; in the Alur language, from &quot;Nam&quot;, &#x27;Lake&#x27;, &quot;Ovoyo&quot;, &#x27;has defeated&#x27;, &quot;Bonyo&quot;, &#x27;Locusts&#x27;. This is due to a local legend that tells how a plague of locusts had destroyed the crops of the people who were living on the eastern shore of the lake, but when they tried to cross to the other side they never got there. 

In 1864, the explorers Samuel Baker and Flóra von Sass found the lake and renamed it after the recently deceased Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria. In the 20th century, Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko temporarily named the lake after himself.

European colonialists operated shipping on the lake. The British planned shipping on Lake Albert as part of a network of railway, river steamer and lake steamer services linking British interests in Egypt, east Africa and southern Africa. The John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company shipyard at Woolston, Hampshire built the cargo and passenger ship for this purpose in 1930. She was named after the British Army officer Robert Thorne Coryndon, who was governor of Uganda 1918–22. Winston Churchill described the ship as &quot;the best library afloat&quot; and Ernest Hemingway called her &quot;magnificence on water&quot;. She either was scuttled in 1962 or sank in 1964. She remains unsalvaged and partly submerged in the lake at Butyaba landing site. These can still be seen to date.

Heritage Oil and Tullow Oil have announced major oil finds in the Lake Albert basin, with estimates that the multi-billion barrel field will prove to be the largest onshore field found in sub-Saharan Africa for more than twenty years.

In March 2014, a boat carrying Congolese refugees capsized in Lake Albert, killing more than 250 people.

On 26 December 2016, a boat carrying 45 members and fans of a local village football team capsized in Lake Albert killing at least 30 people.

On 24 December 2020, thirty people died when a boat capsized en route from Uganda to Congo. The passengers were concerned about travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.

The Kibiro settlement on Lake Albert has cultural and archeological significance.

<text>The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) is a system of protected areas of the United States managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), an agency within the Department of the Interior. The National Wildlife Refuge System is the system of public lands and waters set aside to conserve America&#x27;s fish, wildlife, and plants. Since President Theodore Roosevelt designated Florida&#x27;s Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge as the first wildlife refuge in 1903, the system has grown to over 568 national wildlife refuges and 38 wetland management districts encompassing about .

== Background ==
The mission of the refuge system is &quot;To administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation, management, and where appropriate, restoration of fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats within the United States for the benefit of the present and future generations of Americans&quot; (National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997). The system maintains the biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health of these natural resources and enables for associated public enjoyment of these areas where compatible with conservation efforts.

National Wildlife Refuges manage a range of habitat types, including wetlands, prairies, coastal and marine areas, and temperate, tundra, and boreal forests. The management of each habitat is a complex process of controlling or eradicating invasive species, using fire in a prescribed manner, assuring adequate water resources, and assessing external threats such as development or contamination.

Hundreds of national refuges are home to some 700 species of birds, 220 species of mammals, 250 reptile and amphibian species, and more than 1000 species of fish. Endangered species are a priority of National Wildlife Refuges, with nearly 60 refuges having the primary purpose of conserving in aggregate 280 threatened or endangered species.

The National Wildlife Refuge System welcomes about 65 million visitors each year to participate in outdoor recreational activities. The system manages six wildlife-dependent recreational uses in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, including hunting, fishing, birding, photography, environmental education, and environmental interpretation. Hunters visit more than 350 hunting programs on refuges and on about 36,000 waterfowl production areas. Opportunities for fresh or saltwater fishing are available at more than 340 refuges. At least one wildlife refuge is in every state.

National Wildlife Refuge System employees are responsible for planning, biological monitoring and habitat conservation, contaminants management, visitor services, outreach and environmental education, heavy equipment operation, law enforcement, and fire management.

The National Wildlife Refuge System deals with urban intrusion/development, habitat fragmentation, degradation of water quantity and quality, climate change, invasive species, increasing demands for recreation, and increasing demands for energy development. The system has provided a habitat for endangered species, migratory birds, plants, and numerous other valuable animals, implemented the NWRS Improvement Act, acquired and protected key critical inholdings, and established leadership in habitat restoration and management.

Under the act, the NWRS has created Comprehensive Conservation Plans (CCPs) for each refuge, developed through consultation with private and public stakeholders. These began a review process by stakeholders beginning in 2013. The CCPs must be consistent with the FWS goals for conservation and wildlife management.

The CCPs outline conservation goals for each refuge for 15 years into the future, with the intent that they will be revised every 15 years thereafter. The comprehensive conservation planning process requires a scoping phase, in which each refuge holds public meetings to identify the public&#x27;s main concerns; plan formulation, when refuge staff and FWS planners identify the key issues and refuge goals; writing the draft plan, in which wildlife and habitat alternatives are developed, and the plan is submitted for public review; revision of the draft plan, which takes into consideration the public&#x27;s input; and plan implementation.

Each CCP is required to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and must consider potential alternatives for habitat and wildlife management on the refuge, and identify their possible effects on the refuge. The NEPA requires FWS planners and refuge staff to engage the public in this planning process to assist them with identifying the most appropriate alternative.

Completed CCPs are available to the public and can be found on the FWS website.

==History==
A partial history of the Refuge System is at . For a much more thorough and complete history, see &quot;The History and Future of our National Wildlife Refuge System&quot; compiled by the National Wildlife Refuge Association and referenced below.

==Management activities (as of Q3 2015)==
Comprehensive wildlife and habitat management demands the integration of scientific information from several disciplines, including understanding ecological processes and monitoring status of fish, wildlife and plants. Equally important is an intimate understanding of the social and economic drivers that impact and are affected by management decisions and can facilitate or impede implementation success. Service strategic habitat conservation planning, design, and delivery efforts are affected by the demographic, societal, and cultural changes of population growth and urbanization, as well as people&#x27;s attitudes and values toward wildlife. Consideration of these factors contributes to the success of the service&#x27;s mission to protect wildlife and their habitats.

The refuge system works collaboratively internally and externally to leverage resources and achieve effective conservation. It works with other federal agencies, state fish and wildlife agencies, tribes, nongovernmental organizations, local landowners, community volunteers, and other partners. Meaningful engagement with stakeholders at a regional, integrated level adds to the effective conservation achievements of the FWS and allows individual refuges to respond more effectively to challenges.

Wildlife and habitat management activities include:

# Monitoring plant and animal populations
# Restoring wetland, forest, grassland, and marine habitats
# Controlling the spread of invasive species
# Reintroducing rare fish, wildlife and plants to formerly occupied habitats
# Monitoring air quality
# Investigating and cleaning contaminants
# Preventing and controlling wildlife disease outbreaks
# Assessing water quality and quantity
# Understanding the complex relationship between people and wildlife through the integration of social science
# Managing habitats through manipulation of water levels, prescribed burning, haying, grazing, timber harvest, and planting vegetation

During fiscal year 2015, the refuge system manipulated 3.1 million acres of habitat (technique #10 from the preceding list) and managed 147 million acres of the system without habitat manipulation (using techniques #1 through 9 from the preceding list).

* Uplands managed: 1.9 million acres
* Wetlands managed: 1.0 million acres
* Open water managed: 0.2 million acres
* Treated by prescribed burning: 0.3 million acres
* Treated to control invasive plants: 0.2 million acres
* Protected but not manipulated: 147 million acres

Refuges attract about 65 million visitors each year who come to hunt, fish, observe, and photograph wildlife, and are a significant boon to local economies. According to the FWS&#x27;s &quot;2013 Banking on Nature Report&quot;, visitors to refuges positively impact the local economies. The report details that 47 million people who visited refuges that year:

* Generated $2.4 billion of sales in regional economies
* Supported over 35,000 jobs
* Generated $342.9 million in tax revenues at the local, county, state, and federal levels
* Contributed a total of $4.5 billion to the nation&#x27;s economy

The refuge system has a professional cadre of law enforcement officers that supports a broad spectrum of service programs by enforcing conservation laws established to protect the fish, wildlife, cultural, and archaeological resources the service manages in trust for the American people. They also educate the public about the FWS&#x27;s mission, contribute to environmental education and outreach, provide safety and security for the visiting public, assist local communities with law enforcement and natural disaster response and recovery through emergency management programs, and help protect native subsistence rights. They are routinely involved with the greater law enforcement community in cooperative efforts to combat the nation&#x27;s drug problems, address border security issues, and aid in other security challenges.

Prevention and control of wildland fires is also a part of refuge management. Completion of controlled burns to reduce fuel loading, and participation in the interagency wildland fire suppression efforts, are vital for management of refuge lands.

A considerable infrastructure of physical structures is also essential to proper management of refuge lands. As of September 30, 2019, the refuges had 15,257 roads, bridges, and trails; 5,204 buildings; 8,407 water management structures; and 8,414 other structures such as visitor facility enhancements (hunting blinds, fishing piers, boat docks, observation decks, and information kiosks). The overall facility infrastructure is valued at over $36 billion.

===Physical features===
* Area of land and water under management: 856 million acres
* Number of management units: 568 refuges, 38 wetland management districts, 5 marine national monuments
* Number of wilderness areas: 74
* Area of wilderness: 20.7 million acres (about 20% of overall federal wilderness)
* Length of rivers within the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System: 1,086 miles (1,748 km)
* Length of refuge boundary with Mexico: 120 miles (190 km)

The area of the refuge system is heavily influenced by large areas devoted to protecting wild Alaska and to protecting marine habitats in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans; however, the number of units and public visitation overwhelmingly occurs in the lower 48 states, though these refuges and wetland management districts constitute only about 2% of the area of the system. 
Today&#x27;s Refuge System (September 30, 2022 data) has been assembled through a variety of
different administrative and funding mechanisms. Setting aside the sections of Marine National Monuments outside refuge boundaries (685.7 million of the 759 million total acres in Marine National Monuments), leaves 151 million acres of the more traditional Refuges and Wetland Management Districts. These 151 million acres were acquired as follows:

* 93% (140 million acres) was withdrawn from the public domain or transferred from another federal entity (within this amount, 1.2 million acres of former military bases have become part of the Refuge System)
* 4% (6 million acres) was acquired using funds from the popular &quot;Duck Stamp&quot; program
* 1.14% (1.7 million acres) was acquired with funds from the Land and Water Conservation Fund
* 0.46% (694 thousand acres) was acquired using other funds
* 1.13% (1.7 million acres) was acquired through donations (although relatively modest in terms of acreage [0.27% of refuge acres and 9.3% of wetland management district acres], 58% of refuges and 70% of the counties in wetland management districts had land donated to them)

===Visitation===
* Wildlife observation visits in FY 2021: 41.7 million
* Nature photography visits in FY 2021: 15.1 million
* Fishing visits in FY 2021: 8.0 million
* Interpretive program visits in FY 2021: 2.5 million
* Hunting visits in FY 2021: 2.5 million
* Environmental education visits in FY 2021: 0.4 million
* Other visits in FY 2021: 10.9 million
* Total visits in FY 2021: 65 million

===Volunteers===
* Total volunteers in FY 2014: 36,000
* Total volunteer hours in FY 2014: 1.4 million

===Personnel===
* Total staff: 2,424 full-time equivalents (FY 2022 total)
* Number of Federal Wildlife Officers: 214 (source: FY 2024 Budget Justification)
* Number of firefighters: 460 (360 permanent and 100 temporary staff)

== Special designation areas ==
In addition to refuge status, the &quot;special&quot; status of lands within individual refuges may be recognized by additional designations, either legislatively or administratively. Special designation may also occur through the actions of other legitimate agencies or organizations. The influence that special designations may have on the management of refuge lands and waters may vary considerably.

Special designation areas within the refuge system as of September 30, 2014, included:

* Biosphere reserves (3 units)
* Maine Protected Areas (106 units)
* National Historic Landmarks (10 units)
* National Monuments (7 units)
* National Natural Landmarks (43 units)
* National Recreation Trails (72 units)
* National Wild and Scenic Rivers (13 units)
* Ramsar wetlands of international importance (26 units)
* Research natural areas (207 units)
* Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (19 units)
* Wilderness areas (74 units) (the system has 20.7 million acres of wilderness, 19% of U.S. wilderness)
* World Heritage sites (1 unit)

<doc id="341949" wikidata="Q257425" url="?curid=341949" title="Gojong of Korea">
<text>Gojong (; 8 September 1852 – 21 January 1919), personal name Yi Myeongbok (), later Yi Hui (), also known as the Gwangmu Emperor (), was the penultimate Korean monarch. He ruled Korea for 43 years, from 1864 to 1907, first as the last king of Joseon, and then as the first emperor of the Korean Empire from 1897 until his forced abdication in 1907. His wife, Queen Min (posthumously honored as Empress Myeongseong), played an active role in politics until her assassination carried out by the Japanese.

Gojong oversaw the bulk of the Korean monarchy&#x27;s final years. He was born into the ruling House of Yi, and was first crowned on 13 December 1863 at the age of twelve. His biological father, Grand Internal Prince Heungseon (widely known as Heungseon Daewongun), acted as regent until he reached the age of majority, although he continued holding power until 1874. At this time, Korea was under policies of strict isolationism. By contrast, Japan had been rapidly modernizing under the Meiji Restoration. In 1876, Japan forcefully opened Korea and began a decades-long process of moving the peninsula into its own sphere of influence. For the following few decades, Korea was highly unstable, and subjected to a number of foreign encroachments. Incidents such as the 1882 Imo Incident, the 1884 Gapsin Coup, the 1894–1895 Donghak Peasant Rebellion, and the 1895 assassination of his wife occurred during his reign. All of these incidents were related to or involved foreign powers.

All the while, Gojong attempted to consolidate control, seek foreign support, and modernize the country in order to keep Korea independent. He initiated the Gwangmu Reform, which sought to improve the military, industry, and education, to some amount of success. These reforms were seen as insufficient by some parts of the Korean literati, especially the Independence Club, which Gojong at first tolerated but eventually abolished in 1898. After Japan defeated China in the 1894–1895 First Sino-Japanese War, China lost its suzerainty over Korea, which it had held for centuries. In 1897, shortly after returning from his internal exile in the Russian legation in Seoul, Gojong proclaimed the establishment of the independent Korean Empire, and became its first emperor. Gojong&#x27;s actions drew the ire of Japan. After Japan defeated Russia in the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War, it finally became the sole power in the region, and accelerated its pace of absorbing Korea. Two months after the victory, Korea under Gojong lost diplomatic sovereignty in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905, signed by five ministers of Korea. Gojong refused to sign it and made attempts to bring the treaty to the attention of the international community and convince leading powers of the treaty&#x27;s illegitimacy, but to no avail.

Gojong was forced to abdicate by Japan on 20 July 1907, and was replaced by his son, Yi Cheok. He was then confined to the palace Deoksugung. He made multiple attempts to escape and establish a government in exile abroad, but was unsuccessful each time. Korea formally became a Japanese colony in 1910, and the Korean imperial family was formally absorbed into the Japanese Imperial house. Gojong died on 21 January 1919, in his palace, in conditions that were then and are still seen in Korea as suspicious. The official cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage but rumors persisted that . His death was a direct catalyst for the March First Movement, which in turn bolstered the Korean independence movement.

==Early life==
Yi Myeongbok was born on 25 July 1852, in Jeongseonbang () district, Seoul, Joseon. He was born into the royal House of Yi, and was the son of Yi Ha-eung and Lady Min. After King Cheoljong died without son, the influential Andong Kim clan nominated Yi as the next King. Yi became Prince Ik-seon, shortly before his coronation. He entered the palace on 9 December 1863, and his father and mother were ennobled.

== King of Joseon ==
On 13 December 1863, Yi was crowned in Injeong gate of Changdeokgung. He was only twelve years old when he was crowned. Queen Sinjeong acted as regent until he became an adult. His father, Prince Heungseon Daewongun, assisted in the affairs of Queen Sinjeong&#x27;s regency. In 1866, when the queen proclaimed the abolishment of the regency, Gojong&#x27;s rule started. On 6 March 1866, Min Chi-rok&#x27;s daughter, Lady Min was selected as the new queen. Even though Gojong&#x27;s father Daewongun had no rights to maintain the regency, he still acted as regent illegally.
During the mid-1860s, the Daewongun was the main proponent of isolationism and was responsible for the persecution of native and foreign Catholics, a policy that led directly to the French and the United States&#x27; expeditions to Korea, in 1866 and 1871 respectively. The early years of the Daewongun&#x27;s rule also witnessed a concerted effort to restore the largely dilapidated Gyeongbokgung, the seat of royal authority. During this time, the &quot;Seowon&quot; (private academies that often doubled as epicenters of factional power), and the power wielded by the Andong Kim clan in particular were dismantled.

Finally in 1873, Gojong announced the assumption of his direct royal rule. In November 1874, with the retirement of the Daewongun, Gojong&#x27;s consort, Queen Min (posthumously known as Empress Myeongseong) and Yeoheung Min clan, gained complete control over the court, filling senior court positions with members of her family. It was an open secret that the court and its policy were controlled by the queen consort.

Gojong tried to strengthen the king&#x27;s authority by giving important positions to consort kins and royal family members. It is known that Min Young-hwan, who was a distant relative of Queen Min, was Gojong&#x27;s favorite official.

===External pressures and unequal treaties===
In the 19th century, tensions mounted between Qing China and Imperial Japan, culminating in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894–1895. Much of this war was fought on the Korean peninsula. Japan, having acquired Western military technology after the Meiji Restoration, secured a victory against Joseon forces in Ganghwa Island, forcing Joseon to sign the Treaty of Ganghwa in 1876. Japan encroached upon Korean territory in search of fish, iron ore, and other natural resources. It also established a strong economic presence in the peninsula, heralding the beginning of Japanese imperialist expansion in East Asia. These events were the roots of Gojong&#x27;s antipathy to the Japanese Empire.

The Treaty of Ganghwa became the first unequal treaty signed between Korea and a foreign country; it gave extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens in Korea and forced the Korean government to open three ports, Busan, Chemulpo(Incheon), and Wonsan, to Japanese and foreign trade. With the signing of such a lopsided treaty, Korea became easy prey for competing imperialistic powers, paving the way for Korea&#x27;s annexation by Japan.

===Imo Rebellion and Gapsin Coup===
King Gojong began to rely on a new paid army (&quot;byeolgigun&quot;) of soldiers equipped with rifles. These new armies were requested by the Gaehwa Party and was supervised by Yun Ung-nyeol. In contrast to the well-armed army, the old army had not received a salary for 13 months. The tattered army was finally paid one month&#x27;s salary. Enraged, the old army sparked a riot, and the Daewongun seized power. When the Imo Incident happened, Queen Min requested the Qing Empire for military support. On 27 June 1882, the Qing deployed about 3,000 soldiers in Seoul. They kidnapped the Daewongun on 7 July 1882, which led the Min family to regain political power.

During the Imo incident when Queen Min was taking refuge in her relative&#x27;s villa, Lady Seon-yeong of the Yeongwol Eom clan showed extreme devotion towards King Gojong. He rewarded her fealty by promoting her to the rank of Jimil Sanggung (5th senior rank of Women of the Internal Court).

On 4 December 1884, five revolutionaries attempted a coup d&#x27;état by leading a small anti-old minister army to detain King Gojong and Queen Min. These revolutionaries tried to remove the Qing army from Korea. The Gapsin Coup failed after 3 days. Some of its leaders, including Kim Okgyun, fled to Japan, and others were executed.

While suppressing this coup, Gojong actively invited Qing only to increase the Yuan Shikai&#x27;s influence over Korea. Yet Gojong did try to maintain the independence of his nation. The Chinese even considered abdicating Gojong for consolidation of Qing influence in Korea. For Gojong, he believed that relying on to stronger powers was the best solution in the situation without neither army to guard him nor money. However, these decision never followed his own responsibility, ultimately poisoning his very own nation he intended to save.

===Peasant revolts===
Widespread poverty presented significant challenges to the 19th century Joseon Dynasty. Starvation was rampant, and much of the populace lived in run-down shanties lined along dirt roads. Famine, poverty, crushing taxes, and corruption among the ruling class, led to many notable peasant revolts in the 19th century.

In 1894, the Donghak Peasant Revolution took hold as an anti-government, anti-yangban, and anti-foreign campaign. One leading cause of the revolution was the tax system implemented by Queen Min. Gojong asked for the assistance from the Chinese and Japanese to crush the revolution. Yi Jun-yong and others coordinated with peasants to assassinate Gojong. However, the plot was leaked and the revolution failed. Although the revolution ultimately failed, many of the peasants&#x27; grievances were later addressed with the Gabo Reform.

One of the biggest reforms in 1894 was abolishing the slave (nobi) system, which had existed as far back as the Gojoseon period.

===Assassination of Queen Min===

In 1895, Queen Min, posthumously elevated to Empress Myeongseong, was assassinated by Japanese agents. The Japanese minister to Korea, Miura Gorō, orchestrated the plot against her. A group of Japanese agents entered Gyeongbokgung in Seoul, which was under guard by Korean troops sympathetic to the Japanese, and the queen was killed in the palace. The queen had attempted to counter Japanese interference in Korea. She and her court were pro-Russian in the immediate run-up to the assassination.

===Anti-Japanese sentiments in Korea===
In 1895 Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War, expanding its influence over the Korean government. The Gabo reforms and the assassination of the queen stirred controversy in Korea, fomenting Korean anti-Japanese sentiment. Gojong&#x27;s antipathy toward the Japanese intensified, and he turned to Russia as an ally by signing Russia–Korea Treaty of 1884. He sent many emissaries to Russian Empire.

Some Confucian scholars, as well as peasants, formed over 60 successive righteous armies to fight for Korean freedom. These armies were preceded by the Donghak movement and succeeded by various Korean independence movements.

===Internal exile to the Russian legation===
Pro-Japanese government grew, while anti-Japanese politicians were either killed or fled for their survival after the Chun Sang Door Incident in 1895. Gojong perceived the need for refuge.

On 11 February 1896, King Gojong and his crown prince fled from the Gyeongbokgung to the Russian legation in Seoul, from where they governed for about one year, an event known as Gojong&#x27;s internal exile to the Russian legation. Because of staying in the Russian legation many concessions of Korea were taken by Russia. Gojong sent Min Young-hwan to the coronation of Nicholas II of Russia. Min returned to Korea in October 1896 with Russian Army instructors. These instructors were able to train guards which enabled Gojong to return to palace in February 1897.

== Emperor of Korea ==
=== Coronation ===

On 13 October 1897, Gojong declared himself Emperor of Korea in a ceremony at the newly constructed altar Hwangudan. The name of the state was also changed to the Great Korean Empire, and a new era name &quot;Gwangmu&quot; () was declared. This was a symbolic gesture to mark the end of Qing&#x27;s suzerainty over Korea. That same day, Gojong appointed Sunjong as the Imperial Crown Prince.

=== Consolidation of power and reforms ===
When the Daewongun died in 1898, Emperor Gwangmu refused to attend the funeral of his father because of their poor relationship. But it was also reported that the emperor&#x27;s cries could be heard when he looked over the palace wall.

On 17 August 1899, Gojong enacted the , which granted him absolute power. Despite this, Gojong still entertained the possibility of establishing a constitutional monarchy. He discussed proposals proposed by the reformist Independence Club and Gaehwa Party. However, his reforms were seen as insufficient by members of the Independence Club, which angered them. After rumors emerged, possibly spread by conservative politicians, that the Independence Club planned to abolish the empire and proclaim a republic, Gojong abolished them instead.

Gojong was subjected to many assassination or abdication attempts. First in July 1898, Ahn Gyeong-su, the Minister of Military tried to abdicate Gojong. Ahn was executed for conspiracy on 28 May 1900. Second, on 12 September 1898, Kim Hong-rok tried to assassinate Gojong with by instilling poison in Gojong&#x27;s coffee. In 1904, some Korean students in Japan tried to make Gojong abdicate, and make Prince Imperial Ui the emperor.

=== Efforts to secure Korea&#x27;s independence ===

==== Military reforms ====

Gojong was acutely aware of Korea&#x27;s, and especially its army&#x27;s, need to modernize. Min Young-hwan brought on Russian instructors that were tasked with modernizing the army. Gojong was pleased with their work. In March 1898, the Russian instructors departed, and Gojong ordered the Ministry of Military to take over. By the request of the Minister of Military, Yi Jong-geon, a military academy was established in April 1898. In order to command both the army and navy, Gojong appointed himself as the Grand Field Marshal of the Imperial Korean Armed Forces and the Crown Prince as Field Marshal on 29 June 1898.

On 2 July 1898, Gojong assumed full control over the army. A Board of Marshals was established on 1 August 1899, which Gojong used to further his control. In 1899, he bought weapons from various countries and sent many cadets to Imperial Japanese Army Academy. Meanwhile, he continued expanding the military. By July 1900, there were 17,000 men of the Jinwidae. In 1901, about 44 percent of the Empire&#x27;s total revenue was used for the military.

==== Diplomatic efforts ====
Gojong also attempted to establish ties with other countries. For example, Yi Han-eung was sent to London in 1901 as the acting diplomatic minister to the United Kingdom. But Great Britain rebuffed Yi&#x27;s overtures, and established the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1902. Yi killed himself in protest in May 1905.

== Abdication ==

On 2 July 1907, the information about the dispatch of the envoys reached the ears of Resident-General Itō Hirobumi at the time. Ito was experienced.

On the previous day, the 6th, Song Byeong-jun, a Minister of Agriculture, Commerce and Industry, made a demand to Emperor Gojong.

According to Japanese records, the former council meeting on this day lasted for two hours, during which the Prime Minister instead made a declaration of war and threatened the Emperor, while the Minister of Agriculture, Commerce and Industry pressured him to apologize in front of the palace.

On 16 July, the pro-Japanese cabinet met with the Emperor and demanded that he sign the Eulsa Treaty as a measure to stabilize the country, apologize to the Japanese Emperor, and abdicate the throne. Gojong refused. On 17 July, Seoul was in turmoil. Wall posters appeared in Jongno and other places, saying, &quot;Look at the Imjin War! Is it the result of the Queen&#x27;s execution incident?&quot; &quot;The Japanese aggression is unstoppable and imminent.&quot; The cabinet once again demanded the Emperor&#x27;s abdication. An enraged Gojong once again refused.

On 18 July, a cabinet meeting lasted for two hours at Yi Wan-yong&#x27;s residence. The agenda was the Emperor&#x27;s abdication. The lackeys who received orders from Resident-General Ito Hirobumi announced the Emperor&#x27;s abdication at 8 p.m. The area outside Gyeongun Palace was surrounded by the pro-Japanese organization Iljinhoe, led by Song Byeong-jun. The Emperor requested more time (帝答之以思數日而下批). The meeting, which ended at 10 p.m., resumed at 1 a.m. the next morning.

The details of this meeting are recorded in &quot;Maechen Yarok&quot; by Hwang Hyeon and &quot;Daehan Gye-nyeon-sa&quot; (A History of Late Korean Empire) written by Jung Gyo.

Yi Wan-yong and others withdrew. The overnight council meeting ended at 5 a.m. The attendants entered the meeting hiding pistols in their bosoms. The Minister of Justice cut off all external telephone lines.

On that day, Gojong declared that he would pass the throne to his son. The abdication ceremony took place the next day, 20 July. Gojong personally chose the date and added, &quot;Follow the temporary regulations (權停例).&quot; The temporary regulations refer to a simplified ritual performed by the monarch without sitting on the throne. The Emperor&#x27;s abdication ceremony took place without the presence of Gojong or Sunjong.

The essential element for depriving of ruling power is the deprivation of military power. Yi Byeong-mu, who drew a sword against King Gojong and led the military&#x27;s neutralization under the command of Ito, carried out the military disarmament. Four days later, the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907 was announced. The key point was the dissolution of the Korean Empire&#x27;s military. The secret provisions of the treaty included the following clauses: all military forces except the Royal Guards will be dissolved. Disbanded soldiers will be relocated to Gando and engaged in reclamation. They will also be engaged in reclamation in the desolate areas of the country. The person who announced the dissolution of the military was Prime Minister Yi Wan-yong, and the Minister of Defense, Yi Byeong-mu.

On 19 July, when Emperor Gojong was being threatened, the royal guard unit, which was the palace guard, attempted to enter Gyeongun Palace.

On that night, at that time, Yi Byeong-mu asked the Japanese for a favor, and if Jung Wi-jae continued to doubt him, he told him to take away his weapons.

On 20 July 1907, Gojong was dethroned. Some officials, such as Park Yung-hyo, and Yi Do-jae, tried to assassinate the members of cabinet of Ye Wanyong, who led the abdication. After abdicating, Emperor Gojong was confined to his palace Deoksugung, and the Japanese replaced him with his son, Sunjong.

In June 1910, Gojong tried to escape to Primorsky Krai in Russia and establish a government in exile, but he failed to do so. On 22 August 1910, Korea was formally annexed by Japan. Gojong lost his imperial title, and was instead granted the title, &quot;King Emeritus Yi of Deoksu&quot; (), and was recognized as a member of the imperial family of Japan. In 1915, Gojong again tried to flee from his confinement with the help of Sangsul, but failed. In 1918, he made another attempt, this time with the goal of going to Beijing with Lee Hoe-yeong, but again failed.

== Death and legacy ==

On 21 January 1919, Gojong died suddenly at Deoksugung at the age of 66. There was and still is speculation that . The idea first emerged and was widely circulated around the time of his death.

His death and subsequent funeral proved a catalyst for the March First Movement for Korean independence from Japanese rule. He is buried with his wife at the imperial tomb of Hongneung (), Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province. The couple&#x27;s grave is now considered a UNESCO World Heritage site, as part of the Royal Tombs of the Joseon dynasty.

<text>Bruno Kreisky (; 22 January 1911 – 29 July 1990) was an Austrian social democratic politician who served as foreign minister from 1959 to 1966 and as chancellor from 1970 to 1983. Aged 72, he was the oldest chancellor after World War II.

Kreisky&#x27;s 13-year tenure was the longest of any chancellor in republican Austria and, as an influential political figure in Western European social democracy, he worked closely with likeminded leaders Willy Brandt of West Germany and Olof Palme of Sweden in Socialist International.

== Life and political career ==
Kreisky was born in Margareten, a district of Vienna, to a non-observant Jewish family. His parents were Max (Markus) Kreisky (1876, Klattau – 1944) and Irene Kreisky née Felix (1884, Třebíč – 1969). His father worked as a textile manufacturer. Shocked by the level of poverty and violence in Austria during the 1920s, he joined the youth wing of the Socialist Party of Austria (SPÖ) in 1925 at age 15. In 1927, he joined the Young Socialist Workers against the wishes of his parents. In 1929, he began studying law at the University of Vienna at the advice of Otto Bauer, who urged him to study law rather than medicine, as he had originally planned. He remained politically active during this period. In 1931, he left the Jewish religious community, becoming agnostic. In 1934, when the Socialist Party was banned by the Dollfuss dictatorship, he became active in underground political work. He was arrested in January 1935 and convicted of high treason, but was released in June 1936. In March 1938 the Austrian state was incorporated into Germany through the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, and in September Kreisky escaped the Nazi persecution of Austrian Jews and the coming Holocaust by emigrating to Sweden, where he remained until 1945. On 23 April 1942, he married Vera Fürth (30 December 1916 – 5 December 1988) and had one son and one daughter.

He returned to Austria in May 1946, but he was soon back in Stockholm, assigned to the Austrian legation. In 1951, he returned to Vienna, where Federal President Theodor Körner appointed him Assistant Chief of Staff and political adviser. In 1953, he was appointed Undersecretary in the Foreign Affairs Department of the Austrian Chancellery and in this position he took part in negotiating the 1955 Austrian State Treaty, which ended the four-power occupation of Austria and restored Austria&#x27;s independence and neutrality.

Kreisky was elected to the Austrian parliament, the Nationalrat, as a Socialist during the 1956 election. He was elected to the Party Executive along with Bruno Pittermann, Felix Slavik, and Franz Olah, and thus became a member of the central leadership body of the party. After the 1959 election, he became foreign minister in the coalition cabinet of Chancellor Julius Raab (ÖVP), a post he continued to hold under Raab&#x27;s successors Alfons Gorbach (1961–1964) and Josef Klaus (1964–1966). He played a leading role in setting up the European Free Trade Association, helped solve the South Tyrol question with Italy, and proposed a &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; for the countries of the Third World.

In 1966, the ÖVP under Klaus won an absolute majority in the Nationalrat. Klaus had enough parliamentary support to govern alone; indeed, during the campaign he had called for an end to the grand coalition that had governed Austria since 1945. Memories of the hyperpartisanship that characterized the First Republic were still strong, so he approached Kreisky with new coalition terms. While Kreisky and the other Socialist leadership supported retaining the coalition, the rank and file balked at the proposed terms, and talks broke down. Kreisky resigned from cabinet, and the ÖVP formed the first one-party government of the Second Republic. The Socialists retained some power and were informally consulted on all major decisions. In February 1967, Kreisky was elected chairman of the Socialist Party. At the March 1970 elections, the Socialists won 81 seats, two short of a majority. Kreisky became the first Socialist Chancellor since 1920, heading the first purely left-wing government in modern Austrian history. He was also Austria&#x27;s first Jewish chancellor. Kreisky&#x27;s government was tolerated by the then national-liberal Freedom Party in return for electoral reforms that expanded the Nationalrat and increased the proportionality of votes. Following the passage of these reforms, he called fresh elections in October 1971. Although the reforms were intended to benefit smaller parties, the Socialists won a strong majority government with 93 seats. They also won half the popular vote, something no Austrian party had ever achieved in a free election. Kreisky was reelected in 1975 and 1979 elections, each time winning comfortable majorities in the Nationalrat.

Kreisky turned 70 in 1981, and by this time the voters had become increasingly uncomfortable with what they saw as his complacency and preoccupation with international issues. At the 1983 election, the Socialists lost their absolute majority in the Nationalrat. Kreisky declined to form a minority government and resigned, nominating Fred Sinowatz, his Minister of Education, as his successor. His health was declining, and in 1984 he had an emergency kidney transplant. During his final years he occasionally made bitter remarks directed at his party, who had made him their honorary chairman. He died in Vienna in July 1990.

== Political views and programs ==

In office, Kreisky and his close ally, Justice Minister Christian Broda, pursued a policy of liberal reform, in a country which had a tradition of conservative Roman Catholicism. He reformed Austria&#x27;s family law and its prisons, and he decriminalized abortion and homosexuality. Nevertheless, he sought to bridge the gap between the Catholic Church and the Austrian Socialist movement and found a willing collaborator in the then Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna, Franz König. Kreisky promised to reduce the mandatory military service from nine to six months. After his election, military service was reduced to eight months (if performed in one stretch, or six months plus eight weeks if broken into two segments).

During Kreisky&#x27;s premiership, a wide range of progressive reforms was carried out. Amongst other reforms, employee benefits were expanded, the workweek was cut to 40 hours, and legislation providing for equality for women was passed. Kreisky&#x27;s government established language rights for the country&#x27;s Slovene and Croatian minorities. Following the 1974 oil shock, Kreisky committed Austria to developing nuclear power to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, although this policy was eventually abandoned after a referendum held in 1978. A moderate reform of the penal code was carried out, discrimination against illegitimate children was eliminated, marriage grants were introduced, mother-child pass (a pre-natal/post-natal care and infant health program) was established, a major reform of the penal code was carried out, and sex equality legislation was passed. In addition, four weeks of annual vacation were introduced, the office of ombudsman was established, the law of parentage was reordered, consumer protection legislation was passed, and social security coverage of the self-employed was introduced. In 1979, restrictions on redundancy and the dismissal of employees were made.

Widows&#x27; pensions were indexed in 1970, and in 1972, free medical checks for healthy people were made available, while optional health insurance for students was introduced. Periods of study, illness, and unemployment were allowed pensionable status, and in 1974 family and birth benefits were indexed. The 1973 Special Subsidies Act introduced subsidies for those made redundant as a result of structural changes. The Wage Continuation Act of 1974 introduced wage continuation for workers in private enterprises in cases of sickness. In 1976, accident insurance was extended to work-related activities. The Night-shift/Heavy Manual Work Act of 1981 introduced preventive healthcare and a special early retirement pension for heavy manual workers.

Full sick pay was extended to blue-collar unions in 1974, and family benefits were expanded to include full school transport (1971), a marriage payment (1972), payment for school books (1974), and a birth payment (1976). In 1978, due to a change from tax allowances to direct payments for children, family benefits increased significantly. Between 1973 and 1980, expenditure on health and education rose on average by 13.7% and by 12.9% per annum respectively. In education, pupil/teacher ratios fell sharply and a new university law was passed in 1975 in order to make higher education more democratic. The educational sector was significantly expanded under Kreisky, greatly increasing the numbers of Austrians receiving a university education.

The 1972 Crime Victims Act established the principles of compensation for health damages caused (directly or indirectly) by crimes punishable by more than 6 months&#x27; imprisonment. The 1974 Town Renovation Act dealt with the renovation of residential town areas, while the 1975 Housing Property Act established the property rights of house- and flat-owners. In 1975, housing supplements were extended to cover costs of housing improvements. In 1974, the work prohibiting periods before and after work birth were extended up to 8 weeks, and in 1976 the regulations were extended to adoptive mothers. A 1981 law adapted pension schemes to changes in the families&#x27; loads equalization scheme, and introduced a widowers&#x27; pension equivalent to the widows&#x27; pension. In 1976, accident insurance for pupils and students was introduced, while an act passed that same year enabled people to undertake the care of close relatives who were ill. Under the Bankruptcy Wage Continuation Act of 1979, claims against bankrupt firms were paid from a special fund. In 1982, a maternity allowance payable for 16 weeks was introduced for self-employed women. 

Although the 1955 State Treaty prevented Austria from joining the European Union, he supported European integration. 

Kreisky questioned Zionism as a solution to the problems faced by the Jewish people, claiming that Jews were not an ethnic group or race, but rather a religious group. He even equated claims of the existence of the Jewish people as a distinctive nationality to Nazi claims of a Jewish race, and suggested that such ideas raised questions about Jewish dual loyalty. Kreisky referred to Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin as a terrorist, and had a stormy relationship with Israeli prime minister Golda Meir especially during the 1973 hostage taking. He once said that he was &quot;the only politician in Europe Golda Meir can&#x27;t blackmail.&quot; He cultivated friendly relations with Arab leaders such as Anwar Sadat and Muammar Gaddafi, and in 1980 Austria established relations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. 

Kreisky was notable for his allegedly apologetic approach to former Nazi party members and contemporary far-right Austrian politicians. For example, Kreisky described far-right populist Jörg Haider as &quot;a political talent worth watching&quot;. In 1967, neo-Nazi Austrian leader Norbert Burger declared that he had no objections to Kreisky despite his Jewish background, claiming that he was simply a &quot;German&quot; and neither a religious Jew nor a Zionist. Kreisky felt that he had never personally suffered as a Jew, but only as a socialist. Following his election in 1970, Kreisky wanted to demonstrate that he was indeed &quot;Chancellor of all Austrians&quot;, and appointed four politicians with Nazi backgrounds to his cabinet. When Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal reported that these four members of Kreisky&#x27;s cabinet were former Nazis, Kreisky did not remove them from the government, though one did resign. Kreisky responded that everybody had the right to make political mistakes in their youth. This incident marked the beginning of a bitter conflict, which did not end until Kreisky died. In 1986, Wiesenthal sued Kreisky for libel. Three years later the court found Kreisky guilty of defamation and forced him to pay a substantial fine.

In 1976, the Bruno Kreisky Foundation for Outstanding Achievements in the Area of Human Rights was founded to mark Kreisky&#x27;s 65th birthday. Every two years, the Bruno Kreisky Human Rights Prize is awarded to an international figure who has advanced the cause of human rights.

Later in his life Kreisky tried to help some Soviet dissidents. In particular, in 1983 he sent a letter to the Soviet premier Yuri Andropov demanding the release of dissident Yuri Orlov, but Andropov left Kreisky&#x27;s letter unanswered.

== Legacy ==
Today, Kreisky&#x27;s chancellorship is the subject of both controversy and nostalgia. Many of his former supporters see in Kreisky the last socialist of the old school and look back admiringly at an era when the standard of living was noticeably rising, when the welfare state was in full swing and when, by means of a state-funded programme promoting equality of opportunity, working class children were encouraged to stay on at school and eventually receive higher education. All this resulted in a decade of prosperity and optimism about the future.

Conservatives criticize Kreisky&#x27;s policy of deficit spending, expressed in his famous comment during the 1979 election campaign that he preferred that the state run up high debts rather than see people become unemployed. They hold Kreisky responsible for Austria&#x27;s subsequent economic difficulties.

Despite this criticism, Kreisky did much to transform Austria during his time in office, with considerable improvements in working conditions, a dramatic rise in the average standard of living, and a significant expansion of the welfare state, and arguably remains the most successful socialist Chancellor of Austria.

<text>Lena Maria Jonna Olin (; born 22 March 1955) is a Swedish actress. She has received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award.

Mentored by filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, she made her screen debut with a small role in his film &quot;Face to Face&quot; (1976). After graduating from drama school, Olin joined the Royal Dramatic Theatre, followed by roles in Bergman&#x27;s films &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; (1982) and &quot;After the Rehearsal&quot; (1984). She made her international breakthrough in the role of a free-spirited artist in &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; (1988), which earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.

Olin garnered further critical acclaim for her portrayals of a traumatized Holocaust survivor in the dramedy &quot;Enemies, A Love Story&quot; (1989), based on the novel by Isaac Bashevis Singer, for which she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and an abused wife in the comedy-drama &quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000), for which she received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Her other film roles include &quot;The Adventures of Picasso&quot; (1978), &quot;Havana&quot; (1990), &quot;Romeo Is Bleeding&quot; (1993), &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; (1993), &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; (1999), &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; (2002), &quot;Casanova&quot; (2005), &quot;The Reader&quot; (2008), &quot;Remember Me&quot; (2010), &quot;Maya Dardel&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Wife&quot; (2019).

On television, Olin starred as KGB agent Irina Derevko on the spy thriller &quot;Alias&quot; (2002–2006), which earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. Her other television roles include the sitcom &quot;Welcome to Sweden&quot; (2014–2015), the drama series &quot;Riviera&quot; (2017–2020), and the drama series &quot;Hunters&quot; (2020–2023).

==Early life and education ==
Lena Maria Jonna Olin was born on 22 March 1955, in Stockholm, Sweden, the youngest of three children of actors Britta Holmberg and Stig Olin. 

She studied acting at Sweden&#x27;s National Academy of Dramatic Art from 1976 to 1979.

In October 1974, at age 19, Olin was crowned Miss Scandinavia in Helsinki, Finland.

== Career ==
Olin worked as a substitute teacher and as a hospital nurse, before becoming an actress. 

Olin performed for over a decade with Sweden&#x27;s Royal Dramatic Theatre-ensemble (1980–1994) in plays by William Shakespeare and August Strindberg, and appeared in smaller roles of several Swedish films directed by Bergman and in productions of Swedish Television&#x27;s TV-Theatre Company.

Ingmar Bergman cast Olin in &quot;Face to Face&quot; (1976). A year later, she began acting on the national stage in Stockholm in productions directed by Bergman. She toured internationally with Bergman&#x27;s production of &quot;King Lear&quot; (in which Olin played Cordelia), including Paris, Berlin, New York, Copenhagen, Moscow, and Oslo. Critically acclaimed stage performances by Olin at Sweden&#x27;s Royal Dramatic Theatre included the leading part as The Daughter in &quot;A Dream Play&quot; by Strindberg; Margarita in the stage adaptation of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; by Mikhail Bulgakov; Carlo Goldoni&#x27;s &quot;The Servant of Two Masters&quot;; Ann in Edward Bond&#x27;s &quot;Summer&quot;; Titania in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; by Shakespeare; Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Alchemist&quot;; the title role in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s rendition of Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Miss Julie&quot;, and the neurotic Charlotte in the contemporary drama &quot;Nattvarden&quot; (&quot;The Last Supper&quot;) by Lars Norén.

In 1980, Olin was one of the earliest winners of the Ingmar Bergman Award at the Guldbagge Awards, initiated in 1978 by the director himself, who was also one of the two judges.

Olin&#x27;s international debut in film was a small role in Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; (1980), with Bergman later casting her in her first international lead role, &quot;After the Rehearsal&quot; (1984). In 1988, Olin starred with Daniel Day-Lewis in her first major part in an English-speaking and internationally-produced film, &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, followed by Sydney Pollack&#x27;s &quot;Havana&quot; (1990), Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; (1999), and others. 

In 1989, Olin was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, for her work in &quot;Enemies: A Love Story&quot;, in which she portrayed the survivor of a Nazi death camp. 

She starred in the 1993 thriller &quot;Romeo Is Bleeding&quot;, and in the 1999 American superhero comedy film &quot;Mystery Men&quot;. 

Olin and director Lasse Hallström collaborated on the film &quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000), which received five Academy Award nominations, and worked together again on &quot;Casanova&quot; (2005) (and later in the 2024 TV series &quot;The Darkness&quot;).

In 2002, Olin appeared in her first American television role, joining the main cast of &quot;Alias&quot; for its second season, playing the role of Irina Derevko. For her work on the series, Olin was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2003. 

In 2005, Olin returned to Sweden for a brief period of filming and starred in a supporting role in Danish director Simon Staho&#x27;s film, &quot;Bang Bang Orangutang&quot;. In 2008, Olin appeared in the Oscar-nominated film &quot;The Reader&quot;, playing a Jewish survivor of the Auschwitz death march at a trial in the 1960s, and as the woman&#x27;s daughter twenty years later.

Between 2014 and 2015, Olin starred in Swedish sitcom &quot;Welcome to Sweden&quot;. In 2017 she starred in the American-Polish independent drama film &quot;Maya Dardel&quot;, which screened at SXSW.

From 2020 to 2023 she played Eva Braun-Hitler / The Colonel, leader of the Fourth Reich and Hitler&#x27;s wife, in &quot;Hunters&quot;, an American conspiracy drama television series. In 2024 she played the lead role as Detective Hulda Hermannsdóttir in the Icelandic/American Nordic Noir TV series &quot;The Darkness&quot;, directed by Lasse Hallström, with whom she had previously collaborated.

==Personal life==
Olin has a son, August, from a relationship with actor Örjan Ramberg. Since 1994, she has been married to filmmaker Lasse Hallström, with whom she has a daughter, Tora. They reside in Bedford, New York.

<doc id="341956" wikidata="Q1824681" url="?curid=341956" title="Lightcraft">
<text>The Lightcraft is a space- or air-vehicle driven by beam-powered propulsion, the energy source powering the craft being external. It was conceptualized by aerospace engineering professor Leik Myrabo at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1976, who developed the concept further with working prototypes, funded in the 1980s by the Strategic Defense Initiative organization, and the decade after by the &quot;Advanced Concept Division&quot; of the US Air Force AFRL, NASA&#x27;s MFSC and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

When a Lightcraft is in the atmosphere, air is used as the propellant material (reaction mass). In space, it would need to provide the propellant material from onboard tanks or from an ablative solid. By leaving the vehicle&#x27;s power source on the ground and by using ambient atmosphere as a reaction mass for much of its ascent, a Lightcraft could potentially be capable of delivering a very large percentage of its launch mass to orbit as an SSTO, a difficult task for chemical rockets. As such, a Lightcraft is distinct from a solar sail because it is dependent on the expansion of reaction mass to accelerate rather than being accelerated by light pressure alone. Within the atmosphere, the Lightcraft propulsion is dependent on the external laser power only, so propulsive power is not limited to that generated by usual on-board machinery (i.e. rockets).

==Types==

===Laser-powered propulsion===

First small-scale models used laser propulsion which is a technique still in early stages of development. Lightcraft prototypes are made of solid aluminium machined axisymmetrically. The nose is shaped as a blunted cone for aerodynamical purpose. The rim has an annular air inlet. The aft is a funnel polished as a concave mirror with a pointy tail in the middle extending back out of the body, acting as a parabolic reflector.

A ground-based laser aims a high power pulse to the mirror stern. The beam is reflected and focuses to heat the air at an extremely high temperature up to 30,000 degrees, transforming it in a plasma that violently expands, pushing the craft forward. Air is renewed through the inlet and the cycle is repeated at high frequency, acting as an external pulse detonation engine producing thrust.

In April 1997, tests by Leik Myrabo in cooperation with the US Army at White Sands Missile Range demonstrated the basic feasibility to propel objects in this way, using a 10-kW ground-based pulsed carbon dioxide laser (1 kJ per pulse, 30 μs pulse at 10 Hz frequency). The test succeeded in reaching over one hundred feet, which compares to Robert Goddard&#x27;s first test flight of his rocket design.

In October 2000, a new flight record was set with a flight lasting 10.5 seconds and reaching 71 meters (233 feet) using the same laser, but this time providing an on-board plastic ablative propellant, and rotating the body around its axis at high speed (over 10,000 rpm) to stabilize the craft with a gyroscopic effect.

===Microwave-powered and MHD propulsion===
More advanced concepts of the Lightcraft replace the laser pulses by a microwave beam or maser that can still be ground-based, or alternatively put into orbit, the beams being emitted from above the ascending craft by a series of space-based solar power satellites that could more easily keep track of the Lightcraft along its curved ballistic trajectory.

The microwave beam detonates the air below the craft exactly like the laser version, but some energy from the beam is also diverted and converted on board by high-power rectennas into electricity to power an external-flow airbreathing MHD drive called by Myrabo an &quot;MHD slipstream accelerator&quot;.

As an MHD accelerator works only with an electrically conductive medium, some of the incoming microwaves are also diverted within the Lightcraft through a series of transparent windows and mirror sections, then re-emitted in the air near the electrodes of the MHD accelerators located around the rim. The air becomes ionized in these places, allowing MHD interaction of Lorentz forces to actively control the airflow around a discoidal shape that otherwise (i.e. passively) has very bad aerodynamical properties due to its largest surface, a flat plate, being perpendicular to the flow.

Finally, a laser or some part of the microwaves are also focused as a &quot;plasma torch&quot; at some distance above the Lightcraft, creating an aerospike that detaches and mitigates the bow shock wave ahead of the craft when it evolves at supersonic speeds, lowering heat transfert to the walls. The distance and intensity of the aerospike are tuned according to the atmospheric pressure, temperature gradients and velocity of the airflow to actively shape the shock wave so the boundary layer can be optimally controlled by the radial MHD slipstream accelerators.

The Lightcraft concept thus combines magnetohydrodynamic active flow control and beam-powered propulsion mechanisms to enable hypersonic flight, solving the classical problem of aerial MHD propulsion (i.e. lack of a light power source offering enough energy to feed such systems) by outsourcing the power source. Using microwaves instead of a laser allows four combined actions: propulsive detonation, shockwave mitigation, ionization control and electrical feeding of MHD drives.

== Status ==

In 2008, the Office of Scientific and Technical Information of the US Department of Energy published an article on the official website in which its author William Larson talks about successfully completed research in this area.

After Leik Myrabo&#x27;s retirement from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2011, the homepage of his private company &quot;Lightcraft Technologies, Inc.&quot; (LTI) disappeared with a temporary notification explaining that a &quot;site renovation&quot; was ongoing. The old LTI logo and the small-scale model of the laser Lightcraft prototype of the 1990s were swapped for the occasion with a new logo and an artist image showing a full-scale lenticular microwave-powered Lightcraft with active peripheral MHD slipstream accelerators in orbit above the Earth. This plasma thruster image is shown on the cover of Myrabo&#x27;s book about the Lightcraft. 

That presaged new developments but the site went eventually completely offline and never reappeared since. At that time though, laser aerospike and PDE testing continued in the hypersonic wind tunnel of the &quot;Laboratory of Hypersonics and Aerothermodynamics&quot; at the Department of Aerospace Science and Technology of the Brazilian Air Force in São José dos Campos.

<text>Victor Garber, (born March 16, 1949) is a Canadian stage and film actor and singer. Known for his work on stage and screen, he has been nominated for three Gemini Awards, four Tony Awards, and six Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2022, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Garber originated roles in the Broadway productions of &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; in 1979 (as Anthony Hope), &quot;Noises Off&quot; in 1983 (as Garry LeJuene), &quot;Lend Me a Tenor&quot; in 1989 (as Max), &quot;Arcadia&quot; in 1995 (as Bernard Nightingale), and &quot;Art&quot; in 1998 (as Serge). He&#x27;s received four Tony Award nominations for his performances in the play &quot;Deathtrap&quot; in 1978 (as Clifford Anderson), the Neil Simon musical &quot;Little Me&quot; in 1982 (as The Men in Belle&#x27;s Life), &quot;Lend Me a Tenor&quot; in 1989, and the musical comedy revival of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; in 1994 (as Applegate). He created the role of John Wilkes Booth in the original cast of the 1990 Off-Broadway run of &quot;Assassins&quot;. In 2018, he returned to Broadway in the revival of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; as Horace Vandergelder opposite Bernadette Peters and Gavin Creel.

He made his film debut as Jesus Christ in the musical &quot;Godspell&quot; (1973). He has also been nominated for three Screen Actors Guild Awards along with the casts of the critically acclaimed films &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), &quot;Milk&quot; (2008), and &quot;Argo&quot; (2012), winning for &quot;Argo&quot;. Other notable films include &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1996), &quot;Annie&quot; (1999), &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; (2001), &quot;Sicario&quot; (2015), &quot;Dark Waters&quot; (2019), and &quot;Happiest Season&quot; (2020).

On television, Garber is best known as Jack Bristow in the ABC series &quot;Alias&quot; (2001 to 2006) for which he received three consecutive Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series nominations. He received further Emmy nominations for his portrayal of Sidney Luft in &quot;Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows&quot; (2001) and for his guest roles in the sitcoms &quot;Frasier&quot; in 2001 and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; in 2005. He has since joined the Arrowverse appearing as Martin Stein / Firestorm in the superhero series &quot;The Flash&quot; (2015–2017) and &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; (2016–2017, 2021).

==Early life==
Victor Garber was born in London, Ontario, Canada, and is of Russian-Jewish descent. His father was Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Garber (died 1995), and his mother, Bessie Hope Wolf (died 2005), was an actress, singer, and the host of &quot;At Home with Hope Garber&quot;. He has a brother, Nathan, and a sister, Alisa.

He attended Ryerson Elementary School and London Central Secondary School. Garber began acting at the age of nine in 1958. He enrolled in the children&#x27;s program of the Grand Theatre, and, at age 16, he was accepted at a six-week summer theatre training program at the University of Toronto taught by Robert Gill. In New York, he studied acting at HB Studio.

==Career==

===Music===
In 1967, after a period working as a solo folk singer, Garber formed a folk group called The Sugar Shoppe with Peter Mann, Laurie Hood and Lee Harris. The group enjoyed moderate success, breaking into the Canadian Top 40 with a version of Bobby Gimby&#x27;s song &quot;Canada&quot; (1967). Three other Sugar Shoppe songs made the lower reaches of the Canadian Top 100 in 1967 and 1968. The band had performed on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; before breaking up.

===Theatre===
Garber played Jesus Christ in Toronto&#x27;s 1972 production of &quot;Godspell,&quot; alongside Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Gilda Radner, Dave Thomas, Paul Shaffer and Martin Short. In 1985, he appeared in &quot;Noises Off&quot; at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles.

He appeared on Broadway in the original productions of &quot;Deathtrap&quot;, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; and &quot;Noises Off&quot; (1983), and in the original Off-Broadway cast of &quot;Assassins&quot;, as well as the 1990s revival of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;. In 1986, Garber appeared at Circle in the Square opposite Uta Hagen in &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;. He has been nominated for four Tony Awards and opened the 48th Tony Awards program in 1994 (the year he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;). In 1998, he co-starred on Broadway in the Tony Award-winning play &quot;Art&quot; with Alan Alda and Alfred Molina. In 2005, he played the role of Fredrik Egerman in the Los Angeles Opera production of &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;. He played Ben Stone in a critically praised Encores! staged concert production of &quot;Follies&quot; (2007) opposite Donna Murphy. In mid-2007, he played Garry Essendine in a production of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Present Laughter&quot; at Boston&#x27;s Huntington Theatre. He reprised the role on Broadway in the Roundabout Theatre production, which opened in January 2010.

In January 2018, Garber replaced David Hyde Pierce as Horace Vandergelder in the Tony-winning Broadway revival of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; at the Shubert Theatre opposite Bernadette Peters. Garber began performances on January 20 prior to the press opening on February 22.

Garber received the 2018 Theatre World John Willis Award for Lifetime Achievement.

===Film===
His earlier film work includes &quot;Godspell&quot; (1973) as Jesus Christ (the part he played originally in the 1972 Canadian stage production) and &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993). He starred opposite Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, and Bette Midler in &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; as film producer Bill Atchison, husband of Goldie Hawn&#x27;s character, Elise Eliot, in 1996. In James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), he essayed a Mid-Ulster accent to play the shipbuilder Thomas Andrews.

In 2009, Garber voiced DC Comics supervillain Sinestro in the direct-to-video animated film &quot;Green Lantern: First Flight&quot;. That same year, Garber played a Klingon interrogator in J. J. Abrams&#x27; &quot;Star Trek&quot; film; however, his scenes were deleted from the finished film.

In 2010, Garber had an uncredited cameo in &quot;The Town&quot;, directed by Ben Affleck, as David, a bank manager. Garber also appeared in the film &quot;Ice Quake&quot;. In late 2012, he appeared in Affleck&#x27;s film &quot;Argo&quot;, about the Iran hostage crisis; Garber portrayed Canadian Ambassador to Iran Kenneth D. Taylor. He also co-starred in 2014 thriller &quot;Big Game&quot;.

Garber narrated the 2017 film &quot;They Shall Not Perish&quot;. Other film appearances include &quot;Annie&quot; (1999), &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; (2001), and &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot; (2002).

===Television===
On television, he has had roles on American and Canadian shows. Garber&#x27;s first leading role on television show was in CBS&#x27;s 1985 summer series &quot;I Had Three Wives&quot;. He had a recurring guest role on CTV&#x27;s &quot;E.N.G.&quot; (1991–93). He portrayed Jack Bristow, the father of main character Sydney Bristow on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Alias&quot;, earning three Emmy nominations. He next starred on the television series &quot;Justice&quot; (2006) on Fox and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Eli Stone&quot;. He appeared as Olivier Roth in four episodes of the Canadian science drama &quot;ReGenesis&quot;. He appeared in the Fox series &quot;Glee&quot; in the third episode titled &quot;Acafellas&quot;, as Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison)&#x27;s father Mr. Schuester. He played Dr. Martin Stein / Firestorm on &quot;The Flash&quot; starting with the episode &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, before being spun off onto &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; where he was a series regular for its first and second seasons and half of the third season. Garber made his final appearance as a regular in the episode &quot;Crisis on Earth-X&quot; but reprised his role as in the 100th episode, &quot;Wvrdr_error_100&lt;oest-of-th3-gs.gid30n&gt; not found&quot; during the show&#x27;s seventh season. Aside from the two crossovers, Garber made an independent return to &quot;The Flash&quot; in the season three episode &quot;Duet&quot; as the unnamed husband of gangster Digsy Foss (Jesse L. Martin) in a dreamworld. He once again reprised his role as Martin Stein for a final time in a vocal cameo in the season nine episode &quot;A New World, Part One&quot;. He also played the reoccurring character Admiral Halsey on &quot;The Orville&quot;.

==Personal life==
Garber prefers to keep his personal life private and has largely stayed out of the tabloids. In 2012, he referred publicly to being gay. In 2013, he said &quot;I don&#x27;t really talk about it but everybody knows.&quot; Garber has been in a relationship with Canadian artist and model Rainer Andreesen since 2000. On October 10, 2015, Andreesen announced on his Instagram page that he and Garber were married in Canada. Garber has Type 1 diabetes: he was diagnosed in 1962 at the age of 12.

Garber is good friends with his &quot;Alias&quot; co-star Jennifer Garner and officiated her 2005 wedding to Ben Affleck. Garber and his husband Andreesen were the only guests at the private wedding.

<text>The common reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) is a passerine bird in the bunting family Emberizidae, a group now separated by most modern authors from the finches, Fringillidae. The genus name &quot;Emberiza&quot; is from Old German &quot;Embritz&quot;, a bunting. The specific &quot;schoeniclus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;skhoiniklos&quot;, a now unknown waterside bird.

It breeds across Europe and much of the Palearctic. Most birds migrate south in winter, but those in the milder south and west of the range are resident. It is common in reedbeds and also breeds in drier open areas such as moorland and cultivation. For example, it is a component of the purple moor grass and rush pastures, a type of Biodiversity Action Plan habitat in the UK. It occurs on poorly drained neutral and acidic soils of the lowlands and upland fringe.

==Taxonomy==
The common reed bunting was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Fringilla schoeniclus&quot;. This bunting is now placed in the genus &quot;Emberiza&quot; that Linnaeus had introduced in the same edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;schoeniclus &quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;skhoiniklos&quot;, a word that was used by Greek authors for an unidentified bird. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe but this is now restricted to Sweden. Nineteen subspecies are recognised.

The bird family Emberizidae contains around 300 seed-eating species, the majority of which are found in the Americas, although the genus &quot;Emberiza&quot;, with more than 40 members, is confined to the Old World. Within its genus, the reed bunting is most closely related to the Japanese reed bunting and the Pallas&#x27;s reed bunting, which are sometimes classified as being in the genus Schoeniclus.

Nineteen subspecies are recognised, including- &quot;E. s. schoeniclus&quot;, the nominate subspecies, which occurs in most of Europe, &quot;E. s. witherbyi&quot; which is found in south Portugal, western Spain, France and Sardinia, &quot;E. s. intermedia&quot; from Italy and the Adriatic coast to northwest Albania, &quot;E. s. reiseri&quot; from southeast Albania, northwest Greece, south North Macedonia and west and central Turkey, &quot;E. s. caspia&quot; from east Turkey and northwest Iran, &quot;E. s. korejewi&quot; from southwest and eastern Iran and south Turkmenistan, &quot;E. s. pyrrhuloides&quot; from north Caspian sea region to western Mongolia, southeast Kazakhstan and central Tien Shan, &quot;E. s. passerina&quot; from northwest Siberia, wintering in south Asia, &quot;E. s. parvirostris&quot; from central Siberia wintering in northern China, &quot;E. s. pyrrhulina&quot; from Kamchatka and northern Japan, wintering in central Japan, Korea and eastern China, &quot;E. s. pallidior&quot; from southwestern Siberia wintering in southwest Asia, &quot;E. s. minor&quot; from Russian Far East and northeast China, wintering in east China, &quot;E. s. ukrainae&quot; from Ukraine and adjacent areas of Russia, &quot;E. s. incognita&quot; from southeastern European Russia to north Kazakhstan and &quot;E. s. zaidamensis&quot;, endemic to northwest Qinghai, China.

==Description==
The common reed bunting is a medium-sized bird, long and a mass of 10–28 g, with a small but sturdy seed-eater&#x27;s bill. The male has a black head and throat, white neck collar and underparts, and a heavily streaked brown back. The female is much duller, with a streaked brown head, and is more streaked below.
The song of the male is a repetitive .

==Behaviour==
Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds.

===Breeding===
Breeding normally starts in early April, finishing in late August depending on location and altitude. The species is monogamous. The nest is built using twigs, grass and reeds lined with finer materials such as hair, moss and rootlets in a bush or reed tussock. 4–5 olive-grey eggs are laid, which show the hair-like markings characteristic of those of buntings. The incubation period is 12–15 days where the chicks are fed by both parents.

==Status==
The reed bunting is not globally threatened and classified as least concern by the IUCN. The estimated European population is at least 4.8 million pairs, with particular strongholds in Sweden, Poland and Norway. However, the reed bunting is reportedly declining in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Germany.

<doc id="341965" wikidata="Q15527013" url="?curid=341965" title="Junie Morosi">
<text>Junie Morosi (born 26 July 1933) is an Australian businesswoman, who became a public figure in the 1970s through her relationship with Jim Cairns, Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam Labor government. Morosi&#x27;s appointment as Cairns&#x27;s principal private secretary, and the nature of her relationship with him, aroused intense media interest, and the affair contributed to Cairns&#x27;s eventual dismissal from office and the fall of the government.

==Early life==
Morosi was born in Shanghai, China, and educated in the Philippines. Her father was Italian and part-Chinese, her mother Portuguese and part-Chinese also. The family moved to Manila when she was a child and from age 8 she experienced life under Japanese occupation. She worked as a journalist, becoming political correspondent at the Manila daily newspaper &quot;Voz de Manila&quot;. She also worked in advertising and travel consultancy.

While Morosi was still a teenager she married a Filipino. Together they had three sons. In 1958 she was employed by Qantas, the Australian national airline. In 1962 she moved to Australia, where she married a British businessman living in Australia, David Ditchburn. She continued to work in the airline and travel industry until 1974, when she was employed as an assistant to Al Grassby, the Commissioner for Community Relations. Grassby had been a minister in the Whitlam government before losing his seat in the May 1974 election. Her new job brought her into contact with other Whitlam government ministers. In Canberra she read and was impressed by one of Jim Cairns&#x27; books, &quot;The Quiet Revolution&quot;, and arranged to meet him.

==Jim Cairns==
Cairns was then Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer in the Whitlam government. Tom Uren, another Whitlam minister and one of Cairns&#x27;s closest friends, later recorded that &quot;Jim and Junie were attracted to each other from the first time they met.&quot; She was attracted to his intellect and personal charisma, and he responded to her emotional warmth and unorthodox attitudes. Morosi greatly admired Cairns from having read his academic writings and she introduced Cairns to the work of Wilhelm Reich, opening his mind to the relevance of human psychology as it related to social change. The attraction soon became sexual, although whether and, if so, when their relationship became a sexual one remained a matter of speculation until 2002, when it was confirmed as such by Cairns.

In December 1974 Cairns offered Morosi a position as his Principal Private Secretary, a job traditionally held by a senior public servant. Her business background made the offer at least defensible, but she had no knowledge of Australian politics or economics, and not much experience of managing a large and complex office. The offer of employment aroused an immediate storm of sensationalist media coverage which began on 2 December 1974. The fact that Morosi was &quot;exotic&quot; (the media&#x27;s code-word for &quot;Asian&quot;), youngish (she was 41) and attractive was given much prominence. To this were soon added allegations that both she and Ditchburn had questionable business associates. It was also soon alleged that Ditchburn was using Morosi&#x27;s position to further his business interests.

Cairns&#x27;s friends urged him to withdraw the offer to Morosi, but out of both personal loyalty and a refusal to be bullied by the anti-Labor tabloid press, he refused. He said that there would have been no media outcry &quot;if I had appointed a man, or even a woman who was not good-looking.&quot; Cairns and others pointed out that Elizabeth Reid, who had been appointed Whitlam&#x27;s advisor on women&#x27;s issues in 1973, had received the same sort of media attention. In any case, Cairns and Morosi soon jointly decided it would be best not to flame the media fire any further and both publicly stated that Morosi would not take Cairns&#x27; offer of employment. The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian reported on Cairns&#x27; and Morosi&#x27;s statements with &quot;press accused of spying&quot;, claiming press vilification brought about the outcome, but in such a way that accepted no blame or responsibility. By this stage the media had raised the scandal to &quot;Morosi storm rocking government&quot; status, and bestowed upon it a moniker: &quot;The Morosi Affair&quot;. The Liberal Opposition called for a senate inquiry into the business affairs of Morosi and Ditchburn.

After investigation, it was revealed that there were no irregularities and on 13 December 1974 it was reported that Morosi would accept Cairns&#x27; offer of employment. The media circus resumed. It was aggravated by Morosi&#x27;s decision to give interviews to the Sydney tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot; and the mass-circulation &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot;. Morosi said: &quot;If I had been a white Anglo-Saxon male there would have been no story at all. One day, I was the most sinister, deadly enemy of Australia – a member of the KGB, the Chinese mafia, you name it.&quot; During the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s National Conference in February 1975, Cairns gave an interview to a hostile reporter in which he spoke of &quot;a kind of love&quot; for Morosi. The press continued to encourage speculation; at the National Conference, a photographer hid in a tree and waited while Morosi, her husband, Cairns and his wife were having breakfast on a balcony. The photographer took a photo just when Cairns&#x27; wife left the balcony and with Morosi&#x27;s husband out of shot. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ran the picture of Cairns and Morosi the next day with the headline &quot;Breakfast with Junie&quot;.

Allegations were levelled at Morosi that she used her position as Cairns&#x27; private secretary to cut Cairns off from his political associates and from alternative sources of advice. Morosi was working for Cairns during the incident that eventually led to Cairns&#x27; political demise. Cairns was introduced by Robert Menzies to George Harris, a Melbourne businessman and president of the Carlton Football Club. Harris had offered to secure loan funds for the Australian government and in March 1975, Cairns signed a letter agreeing to a 2.5% commission. Many blamed the disorganised state of Cairns’ office for what ultimately turned out to be a misleading statement to parliament in June that he had not authorised any such commission. Cairns claimed that he had signed the letter in question unknowingly while signing a batch of fifty or so letters, and that it was not uncommon practice for politicians to sign letters and subsequently to have little or no memory of their content. Ironically, politicians from across the aisle – Malcolm Fraser and a number of his ministers – spoke out in defence of Cairns on this subject, agreeing that they too signed letters of which they had little or no memory. But the fact remained that Cairns did sign the letter and, as a result, Whitlam dismissed Cairns from the ministry on 2 July 1975. The supposed relevance of this incident to Morosi is the implication that, as Cairns&#x27; private secretary, Morosi was to blame for any disorganisation present in Cairns&#x27; office that may have contributed to him signing the infamous letter but not remembering having done so. However, in a 1998 interview, when asked whether Morosi was a good office organiser, Jim Cairns was quoted as saying &quot;No. She wasn&#x27;t supposed to be an office organiser. The criticism that has been levelled at her is made by very jealous and envious people, who were supposed to be organising the bloody office themselves.&quot;

After Cairns was dismissed from the Ministry in July 1975, he kept Morosi on his backbencher&#x27;s staff as a research assistant. She published her version of events in a book, &quot;Sex, Prejudice and Politics&quot;, later in the year. Together they worked on a new project for an alternative lifestyles festival to be held near Canberra. The Down to Earth Festival in December 1975 attracted 10,000–15,000 people. Cairns and Morosi continued to work on developing the movement until 1977, when Cairns retired from Parliament.

==Life after politics==
By 1977, however, the same allegations that had been made against Morosi in the political world were being made in the alternative lifestyle movement: specifically, that she was manipulating Cairns, and that her husband was manipulating both of them for financial gain. Cairns and Morosi subsequently severed any formal links with the Down to Earth movement in 1979, leaving a legacy of ill-feeling and disputes over money which eventually led to litigation in the New South Wales courts. The Down To Earth (Victoria)Cooperative Society LTD continues to host an annual ConFest (Conference Festival) that Jim Cairns initiated in 1976. In recent years the cooperative has extended invitations to Junie to attend festivals with appreciation of her role as a key founder and members have interviewed her in her home.

By 1981 Morosi had moved on to a new project, the Wyuna Co-operative, a &quot;community housing project&quot; in Canberra involving Morosi and Ditchburn as well as Morosi&#x27;s brother and sister-in-law, with some financial support from Cairns. In 1985 the co-operative received a $133,000 grant from the Community Housing Expansion Program of the federal Territories Department. When the &quot;National Times&quot; newspaper revealed this, Prime Minister Bob Hawke intervened and the program was wound up. Morosi complained that the controversy was entirely because of her involvement, and indeed an inquiry later found that there was nothing improper about the grant, although it was critical of Wyuna&#x27;s management.

Despite the inquiry&#x27;s findings, the government froze the grant and attempted various circuitous measures to ensure that the Wyuna Co-operative could not make use of it. The resulting proceedings dragged on, and in 1986 Morosi was hospitalised suffering from stress and exhaustion. In 1988, the matter was finally settled and the grant was provided. By this time however, the strain and legal costs had ruined both Morosi and Ditchburn&#x27;s business interests and contributed to Morosi&#x27;s divorce from Ditchburn. These events also effectively marked the end of Morosi&#x27;s relationship with Cairns, who was reconciled with his wife, although Morosi and Cairns remained friends until Cairns&#x27; death in October 2003.

==Defamation case==
Morosi gradually faded from public attention, but her tumultuous years in the spotlight continued to haunt her. Media outlets continued to make allegations about her relationship with Cairns, and she successfully sued 2GB and &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; for defamation. She won $17,000 in damages from &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; and $10,000 from 2GB. On 2GB Ormsby Wilkins had said that &quot;Junie Morosi is an immoral adventuress who has slept with a variety of notable politicians.&quot;

In &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; case, Morosi told the court: &quot;I felt insulted, angry, upset and hurt. It was very demeaning to me as a woman [to be called Cairns&#x27;s &#x27;girlfriend&#x27;]. I saw myself as a professional, as a competent person doing her job. It was cheap. It was as though it had nothing to do with business but everything to do with sex.&quot; The jury decided the article in question did imply a sexual relationship, but was &quot;not defamatory.&quot; In 2002 Cairns admitted his relationship with Morosi had been sexual.

<text>Pallas&#x27;s reed bunting (Emberiza pallasi), also known as Pallas&#x27;s bunting, is a passerine bird in the bunting family Emberizidae, a group now separated by most modern authors from the finches, Fringillidae.

==Taxonomy==
The bird family Emberizidae contains around 300 seed-eating species, the majority of which are found in the Americas, although the genus &quot;Emberiza&quot;, with more than 40 members, is confined to the Old World. Within its genus, the reed bunting is most closely related to the Japanese reed bunting and the reed bunting, which are sometimes classified as being in the genus Schoeniclus. 

The genus name &quot;Emberiza&quot; is from Old German &quot;Embritz&quot;, a bunting. The English name and the specific &quot;pallasii&quot; commemorate German naturalist and explorer Peter Simon Pallas.
It breeds across northern and central Asia across to Mongolia. It is a migrant, which winters in south east Asia. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, but has occurred as far west as Great Britain.
===Subspecies===
Three subspecies are recognised- &quot;E. p. polaris&quot;, which occurs in most of northeast European Russia, north Kamchatka and winters in eastern China, &quot;E. p. pallasi&quot; which is found in Mongolia and Transbaikalia and winters in west and north China and &quot;E. p. lydiae&quot;, which occurs in south Siberia, northern Mongolia and winters in north China.

==Habitat==
It is common in tundra scrub by water, and also breeds in drier open areas such as open larch forest.
==Description==
The Pallas&#x27;s reed bunting is a small passerine bird, similar to a small reed bunting. It has a small seed-eater&#x27;s bill. The male has a black head and throat, white neck collar and underparts, and a heavily streaked grey back (reed bunting has a browner back). The female is much duller, with a streaked brown head. It is less streaked below than female reed bunting.

The song of the male is a repetitive &quot;sherp&quot;.
==Behaviour==
Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds. 
===Breeding===
Breeding occurs between June and August, being earlier in the north of its range. The nest is in a bush, typically made from grasses and sedges, lined with finer materials such as smaller grasses and hair. 3–5 cream-coloured eggs are laid, which show the hair-like markings characteristic of those of buntings. The incubation period is 11 days.

<text>The Korean Broadcasting System (KBS; ) is the national broadcaster of South Korea. Founded in 1927, it is one of the leading South Korean television and radio broadcasters under the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

The KBS operates seven radio networks, ten television channels and multiple Internet-exclusive services. Its flagship terrestrial television station, KBS1, broadcasts on channel 9 while KBS2, an entertainment-oriented network, broadcasts on channel 7. KBS also operates the international service KBS World, which provides television, radio and online services in 12 languages.

==History==
===Early radio broadcasts===
The KBS began as Gyeongseong Broadcasting Station () with call sign JODK, established by the Governor-General of Korea on 16 February 1927. It became the in 1932. After Korea was liberated from Japanese rule at the end of World War II, this station started using the call sign HLKA in 1947 after the US-occupied Korea was granted the ITU prefix HL. After a national broadcast, the station was renamed Seoul Central Broadcasting Station in 1948.

===1950s–1960s – Television===
Television broadcasts in South Korea began on 12 May 1956 on HLKZ-TV. After financial difficulties, it was acquired by KBS in 1961.

===1970s – Expansion===
KBS changed its focus from being a state-controlled media and adopted the concept of being a public-oriented broadcaster on 3 March 1973. Construction of KBS headquarters in Yeouido started in 1976. In 1979 KBS radio began broadcasting on the FM band with the launch of KBS Stereo (now KBS 1FM). Colour television began that year.

===1980s – Advertising ===
KBS began broadcasting advertising in 1980, differing from the norm of public broadcasters, after the forced merger of several private broadcasters into KBS by the military government of Chun Doo-hwan. It also bought 65% of the shares of the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation and the Kyunghyang Shinmun.

During the rule of Chun Doo-hwan, a new law in 1980 forced public broadcasters to merge with KBS. These broadcasters had shown news stories against Chun, leading him to stifle their criticism. These included:
* Tongyang Broadcasting Corporation (TBC)
* Dong-A Broadcasting System (DBS)
* Seohae Broadcasting Corporation (SBC)
* Jeonil Broadcasting Corporation (VOC)
* Hanguk-FM (BBC)
Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) was also affected. MBC was, at first, a federation of 20 loosely affiliated member stations across South Korea. Although they shared programming, each station was privately owned (similar to the UK ITV network before the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990). After the consolidation, however, affiliates were forced to give up a majority of shares to MBC Seoul. MBC Seoul, in turn, was forced to give up 65% of its shares to KBS. In 2009, president Lee Myung-bak said that the law was unconstitutional, and in 2011 TBC and DBS were revived as JTBC and Channel A, respectively.

===1990s – Spinoff of EBS===

In 1981, KBS launched KBS 3TV and Educational FM and on 27 December 1990, both were officially separated from KBS to form the Educational Broadcasting System (EBS).

After a revision of the television licensing fee system in 1994, 1TV and Radio1 stopped broadcasting commercials altogether.

=== 2000s ===
KBS 2FM from 1980 until 2002 was prohibited to air commercial advertisements. In 2002 ads resumed airing.

===2010s===
After first broadcasting HD programmes in 2001, KBS completely switched to digital broadcasting in 2012.

On 16 January 2012, a dispute broke out between KBS and the Korea Cable TV Association (KCTA) over carriage fees. KCTA sought to reduce fees from major national networks for carrying their feeds through subscription providers. KBS had demanded 280 won per subscriber, while the TV providers offered only 100 won per subscription. Negotiations reached a standstill, and so the providers decided to stop carrying KBS2. KBS2 experienced major decline in their ratings, affecting shows such as &quot;Brain&quot; at the time. Following the blackout, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) ordered the TV providers to resume distributing the channel or face a hefty fine. They initially refused, but on 17 January, they agreed to resume the channel&#x27;s carriage.

In 2011, Sohn Hak-kyu, the chairman of the Democratic Party, accused KBS of wiretapping the party&#x27;s closed-door meeting on TV subscription charges.

Journalists working for KBS (along with MBC, SBS and YTN) protested against journalism practices that favored the Lee Myung-bak government in 2012. The union for KBS released a video clip &quot;Reset KBS News 9&quot; (리셋 KBS 뉴스9) on the internet that discussed the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office Civilian Surveillance Incident and the controversial money-spending on renovating President Lee&#x27;s alleged birth house on 13 March 2012.
On 3 March 2013, computer shutdowns hit South Korean television stations including KBS. The South Korean government asserted a North Korean link in the March cyberattacks, denied by Pyongyang.

In 2013, KBS World Radio commemorated its 60th anniversary, and KBS World TV celebrated 10 years of its foundation.

In 2014, KBS World 24 was launched, mainly for Koreans abroad.

In 2015, KBS was honoured to have its archives of the KBS Special Live Broadcast, Finding Dispersed Families, inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register. This makes KBS only the world&#x27;s second broadcaster to have a broadcast programme on the prestigious list.

The KBS network delivered the exclusive Special Live Broadcast, Finding Dispersed Families, via its primary channel, KBS1. KBS News was the program&#x27;s producer. The program premiered on 10:15 pm KST on 30 June 1983. After more than 6 months, the special live programme ended at 4 am on 14 November 1983. This marks a total duration of 453 hours and 45 minutes of live broadcast over 138 days, aired nationwide on KBS1. The KBS&#x27;s archives of Special Live Broadcast, Finding Dispersed Families include; 463 videotapes of the original recordings, and many associated materials, generated in the course of the broadcast, such as the posters carrying the participating dispersed family members&#x27; capsule stories, cue sheets, programming schedules, radio recording materials, and related photographs. A total of 20,522 such assorted materials are preserved in the archives. The program was the biggest public affairs program ever produced by KBS and was the first to tackle the issue of families separated because of the long Korean War (1950–1953), which garnered even international coverage.

In 2017, KBS launched the world&#x27;s first terrestrial UHD broadcasting service.

In June 2018, KBS led the operation of the IBC (International Broadcasting Centre) inside the KINTEX (Korea International Exhibition Center), located in Goyang, as Host Broadcaster for the April 2018 inter-Korean summit. During the summit, KBS successfully delivered all the moments associated with the historic summit for more than 3,000 local and overseas media representatives, gathered at the IBC. Throughout the day of the summit, KBS delivered live coverage through its continuous special news bulletins. Its prime-time news programmes, KBS News 9 and KBS Newsline provided audiences with highlights and implications of the historic summit through comprehensive reports. Also, KBS World TV delivered Live Coverage of April 2018 Inter-Korean summit with English subtitles for its audiences across 117 countries worldwide.

In May 2019, as the public service broadcaster in South Korea, KBS undertook a major reform in its Disaster Broadcast System in order to provide emergency services in times of emergency. To be headed by President and CEO of KBS, the renewed system allowed the use of maximum resources of the organization under emergency circumstances. Under the reform, KBS focused on: swift and efficient emergency broadcast and coverage; delivering essential information in innovative ways with the ultimate aim to minimise losses and damage; and strengthening its digital platforms to better serve wide-ranging audience groups. In particular, KBS signed contracts with sign language interpreters in an effort to enhance broadcast services for audiences with disabilities. In addition, KBS is committed to improve its English subtitle services for people from overseas.

==Structure==

KBS is an independently managed public corporation () funded by the South Korean government and license fees. As part of the Constitution, the KBS president is chosen by the President of South Korea, as recommended by its board of directors. Political parties in South Korea have the right to name members of the KBS board of directors.

This system gives politicians effective control over choosing the president of KBS, as well as its board of directors. People who are critical of the system cite political intervention in KBS&#x27;s governance as reason for revising the current system of recruiting.

In order to uphold and defend independence, KBS, since 2018, created a &#x27;Public Advisory Group&#x27;, as part of the selection process of new KBS President and CEO. Each President and CEO of KBS is recommended by the KBS Board of Governors. The Group examines Presidential candidates via a presentation, a panel discussion, and an interview. Each is ultimately appointed by the President.

Around 49% of KBS&#x27;s revenue comes from a mandatory television licence fee of 2,500 won, on top of 18.7% from commercial advertisement sales.

In addition to 18 regional stations and 12 overseas branches, eight subsidiary companies such as KBSN, KBS Business and KBS Media manage KBS content.

KBS carried out organizational reform on 1 March 2019 to strengthen KBS capabilities of content creation; enhance digital work flow; and improve audience services. KBS created Content Production 2 Division that is responsible for production, marketing, as well as content businesses. The new division aims to bring outstanding dramas and entertainment programming by boosting creative nature of the production function, and minimizing its decision-making process.

The strategy introduced Public Service Media Strategy team under Strategy and Planning Division. Public Service Media Strategy is mainly responsible for developing KBS&#x27;s digital programs via assorted digital media platforms. The reform brought changes in Programming Division as Digital Media department expanded its roles. Digital News department attached to News and Sports Division strengthened its functions. Another significant change is that the &#x27;Audience Relations Center&#x27; has become an executive department, operated directly by KBS President and CEO. The Audience Relations Center dedicates its resources to enhance audience services, and create participation opportunities for audiences. Local Stations Management was reorganized to be supervised under KBS Executive Vice President, in response to a growing demand for greater regional autonomy.

<text>In South Korea, there are a number of national television networks, the three largest of which are KBS, MBC, and SBS. Most of the major television studios are located on Yeouido and Sangam-dong, Seoul. South Korea became the fourth adopter in Asia when television broadcasting began on 12 May 1956 with the opening of HLKZ-TV, a commercially operated television station. HLKZ-TV was established by the RCA Distribution Company (KORCAD) in Seoul with 186–192 MHz, 100-watt output, and 525 scanning lines.

Important genres of television shows include serial dramas, historical dramas, variety shows, game shows, news programs, and documentaries. All three networks have produced increasingly lavish historical dramas in recent years. Some South Korean television programs are available on satellite and multicultural channels in foreign countries. South Korean television dramas have been widely popular in other East Asian, South Asian and Southeast Asian countries, and became popularized internationally at a later stage, with whole sets of videotapes or DVDs of series available with completed subtitles in different languages, online subtitle websites are also created by numerous fan clubs to cater to a global audience. Shopping channels have become quite popular in recent years as well, and the models sometimes put on entertaining acts during product pitches.

Most cable operators in South Korea were consolidated into 3 major telecommunication companies, KT, SK Telecom, and LG Uplus. They also operates Internet Protocol television services. There are approximately 14 million cable TV subscribers nationwide. The cable operator provides TPS to its subscribers. (with the exception of Arirang which is free).

== History ==
Since the beginning of the 1950s, television was introduced to Korea by RCA to sell second-hand black &amp; white TV sets as a marketing scheme. Some TV sets were strategically set up at Pagoda Park, others at the Seoul Station and Gwanghwamun during this time. However it was not until 1956 when South Korea began its own television broadcasting station, the HLKZ-TV, part of the KORCAD (RCA Distribution Company). The first ever Korean television drama, 천국의 문 (The Gates of Heaven) debuted the same year, planning director Choi Chang-Bong spent two and a half months continuously fixing the script, preparing sets and even the first instance of special effects, all for a drama that lasted no longer than fifteen minutes.

The early 1960s saw a phenomenal growth in television broadcasting. On 1 October 1961 the first full-scale television station, HLKA-TV (now known as KBS 1TV), was established and began operation under the Ministry of Culture and Public Information.

Following KBS was Tongyang Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s TBC-TV which was launched in 1964, and ran until merged in 1980. It was the first private television network in South Korea.

The second commercial television system, MBC-TV, made its debut in 1969. The advent of MBC-TV brought significant development to the television industry in Korea and after 1969 the television industry was characterized by furious competition among the three networks.

The 1970s were highlighted by government intervention into the media system in Korea. In 1972, President Park Chung Hee government imposed censorship upon media through the Martial Law Decree. The government revised the Broadcasting Law under the pretext of improving the quality of television programming. After the revision of the law, the government expanded its control of media content by requiring all television and radio stations to review programming before and after transmission. Although the government argued that its action was taken as a result of growing public criticism of broadcasting media practices, many accused the government of wanting to establish a monopoly over television broadcasting.

The 1980s were the golden years for South Korea&#x27;s television industry. Growth was phenomenal in every dimension: the number of programming hours per week rose from 56 in 1979 to nearly 88.5 in 1989; the number of television stations increased from 12 in 1979 to 78 by 1989; and the number of television sets grew from four million in 1979 to nearly six million in the same period. Despite producing color televisions for export, color television was not officially introduced in the country until late 1980. Color broadcasting, however, occasioned a renewal of strong competition among the networks. However, the South Korean TV industry was also suffered huge blows in this decade. During Chun Doo-hwan&#x27;s regime, several newspapers, broadcasters and publications were forcibly closed, or were merged into a single organization. One of which is TBC-TV which was awarded to KBS. TBC-TV was then replaced by KBS 2TV. After the country&#x27;s 1987 democratic reforms, several regulations were imposed to insulate broadcasters from political influence. For example, the National Assembly established the Foundation for Broadcast Culture to insulate MBC from political influence and KBS.

At the beginning of the 1990s, with the introduction of cable television, the government initiated an experimental multi-channel and multi-purpose cable television service. In addition, South Korea launched its first broadcasting/communication satellite, Mugungwha 1, to 36,000 km above the equator in 1995. The development of an integrated broadband network is expected to take the form of B-ISDN immediately after the turn of the century. This decade is a period of great technological change in the South Korean broadcasting industry, which will make broadcasting media even more important than in the past. In this decade the South Korean broadcasting industry will maximize the service with new technological developments such as DBS, satellites, and interactive cable systems, all of which will allow South Korea to participate fully in the information society.

On 22 July 2009, after heated political debates, amendment of the Media law passed the South Korean national assembly to deregulate the media market of South Korea. On 31 December 2010, four general Cable Television networks were licensed.

All analog broadcastings officially full-time completely turn off on New Year&#x27;s Eve (31 December) 2012 at 03:59:59 KST (UTC+9) for all nationwide (including Seoul Metropolitan Area such as Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and Incheon) so all analog broadcastings officially full-time completely turn off on same time. On New Year&#x27;s Eve (31 December) 2012 at 04:00:00 KST (UTC+9), the digital terrestrial television of the South Korea fully turned, shifted and switched to all full ultra high definition for all nationwide (including Seoul Metropolitan Area such as Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and Incheon).

== National networks ==
In South Korea, there are four nationwide free-to-air terrestrial television networks, three general networks and one educational network as follows:

== List of television channels ==
All of them are free-to-air channels. Furthermore, all of them are the official digital terrestrial television and ATSC providers of the nation (since 2005, approved by the Korean Government).

===Public broadcasting channels===
===Commercial broadcasting channels===
In South Korea, many commercial television networks have been created after the deregulation taken in 1961 till 1990.
SBS is responsible in distributing its programming content nationally, but is not responsible for producing local content aired by their affiliates.

==== MBC Networks Channel ====
Local broadcasting companies affiliated with MBC Networks originally started as affiliated broadcasting stations in the same way as SBS Networks.

After Policy for Merger and Abolition of the Press, Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation took over 50% of the shares in local broadcasting stations, and all local broadcasting stations became subsidiaries of Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation.

Due to this background, MBC Networks is currently operating simultaneously with the characteristics of public broadcasting and commercial broadcasting.

==== SBS Networks Channel ====
SBS, which was originally established as an independent broadcasting station, was established in 1995 by PSB (Currently, KNN), CJB, TBC, and TJB, and SBS Networks was created around SBS.

Currently, 9 broadcasting stations are affiliated.

==== YTN DMB Network ====
Founded in 2005, YTN DMB is a broadcasting station that relays the broadcasting of YTN&#x27;s channel.

In November 2006, a contract was signed with a local broadcasting station affiliated with the SBS network, and in June 2008, YTN DMB network was created, which began broadcasting to local areas.

All channels belonging to the network can only be viewed on devices that support T-DMB.

==== Independent station ====
After 1990, independent broadcasting stations excluding SBS include iTV Kyung-in Broadcasting (formerly iTV Incheon Broadcasting), which opened in 1997 and closed in 2004, and OBS Gyeongin TV, which opened in 2007.

The viewing area of the two broadcasting stations was the same in Seoul Metropolitan Area, and among them, iTV Kyung-in Broadcasting was broadcast to other regions through Pay television and served as a Superstation.

<doc id="341974" wikidata="Q1397729" url="?curid=341974" title="William Grant Still">
<text>William Grant Still Jr. (May 11, 1895 – December 3, 1978) was an American composer of nearly two hundred works, including five symphonies, four ballets, nine operas, and more than thirty choral works, art songs, chamber music, and solo works. Born in Mississippi and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas, Still attended Wilberforce University and Oberlin Conservatory of Music as a student of George Whitefield Chadwick and then as a student of Edgard Varèse. Because of his close association and collaboration with prominent African-American literary and cultural figures, Still is considered to be part of the Harlem Renaissance.

Still was the first American composer to have an opera produced by the New York City Opera. He is known primarily for his first symphony, &quot;Afro-American Symphony&quot; (1930), which, until 1950, was the most widely performed symphony composed by an American. Still often is referred to as the &quot;Dean of Afro-American Composers&quot;. He was able to become a leading figure in the field of American classical music as the first African-American to conduct a major American symphony orchestra, have a symphony performed by a leading orchestra, have an opera performed by a major opera company, and have an opera performed on national television. The papers of Still and his second wife, the librettist and writer Verna Arvey, are currently held by the University of Arkansas.

== Life ==
William Grant Still Jr. was born on May 11, 1895, in Woodville, Mississippi. He was the son of two teachers, Carrie Lena Fambro Still Shepperson (1872–1927) and William Grant Still Sr. (1871–1895). His father was a partner in a grocery store and performed as a local bandleader. William Grant Still Sr. died when his infant son was three months old.

Still&#x27;s mother and he moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, where she taught high school English. In 1904, She met and married Charles B. Shepperson, who nurtured the musical interests of his stepson William by taking him to operettas and buying Red Seal recordings of classical music that the boy greatly enjoyed. The two also attended a number of performances by musicians on tour. His maternal grandmother, Anne Fambro, sang African-American spirituals to him.

Still showed a great interest in music and started violin lessons in Little Rock at the age of 15. He taught himself to play the clarinet, saxophone, oboe, double bass, cello, and viola. At 16 years old, he was graduated as class valedictorian from M. W. Gibbs High School in Little Rock in 1911.

His mother wanted him to go to medical school, so Still pursued a bachelor of science degree program at Wilberforce University, a historically black college in Ohio. Still became a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. He conducted the university band, learned to play various instruments, and started to compose and to perform orchestrations. He left Wilberforce without graduation.

Using a small amount of money left to him by his father, he began studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. Still worked for the school assisting the janitor and at a few small jobs outside of the school, but struggled financially. When Professor Lehmann asked him why he wasn&#x27;t studying composition, Still replied that he simply couldn&#x27;t afford to. When this became known, George Whitfield Andrews taught composition to Still, without charge. He also was able to study privately with the modern French composer Edgard Varèse and the American composer George Whitefield Chadwick.
On October 4, 1915, Still married Grace Bundy, whom he had met while they were both at Wilberforce. They had a son, William III, and three daughters, Gail, June, and Caroline. They separated in 1932 and divorced February 6, 1939.

Still had moved to Los Angeles after receiving his first fellowship in 1934.

On February 8, 1939, he married pianist Verna Arvey. They drove to Tijuana for the ceremony because at the time, &#x27;interracial&#x27; marriage was illegal in California. They had two children, a daughter, Judith Anne, and a son, Duncan. Celeste Headlee, a broadcast journalist, an author, a classically-trained soprano, and daughter to Judith Anne, is Still&#x27;s granddaughter.

On December 1, 1976, Still&#x27;s home at 1262 Victoria Avenue in Oxford Square, Los Angeles was designated as Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #169.

He died in Los Angeles in 1978.

== Career ==

In 1916, Still worked in Memphis for W.C. Handy&#x27;s band. He then joined the United States Navy to serve in World War I in 1918, and eventually moved to Harlem after the war, where he continued to work for Handy. During this time, Still was involved with many cultural figures of the Harlem Renaissance including the likes of Langston Hughes, Alain Locke, Arna Bontemps, and Countee Cullen.

He recorded with Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s Dance Orchestra in 1921, and later played in the pit orchestra for Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake&#x27;s musical, &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; and another pit with Sophie Tucker, Artie Shaw, and Paul Whiteman. Under Henderson, he joined Henry Pace&#x27;s Pace Phonograph Company, known as Black Swan Records. Later in the 1920s, Still served as the arranger of &quot;Yamekraw&quot;, a &quot;Negro Rhapsody&quot;, composed by the Harlem stride pianist, James P. Johnson.

In the 1930s, Still worked as an arranger of popular music, composing works for popular NBC Radio broadcasts such as Willard Robison&#x27;s &quot;Deep River Hour&quot; and Paul Whiteman&#x27;s &quot;Old Gold Show.&quot;

Still&#x27;s first major orchestral composition, &quot;Symphony No. 1 &quot;Afro-American&quot;,&quot; was performed in 1931 by the Rochester Philharmonic, conducted by Howard Hanson. It was the first time the complete score of a work by an African American was performed by a major orchestra. By the end of World War II, the piece had been performed in orchestras located in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, and London. During this time, the symphony was arguably the most popular of any composed by an American so far. As a result of a close professional relationship with Hanson; many of Still&#x27;s compositions were performed for the first time in Rochester.

In 1934, Still moved to Los Angeles after receiving his first Guggenheim Fellowship, allowing him to start work on the first of his nine operas, &quot;Blue Steel&quot;. Two years later, Still conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl, the first African American to conduct a major American orchestra in a performance of his own works.

Still arranged music for films such as &quot;Pennies from Heaven,&quot; starring Bing Crosby and Madge Evans, and &quot;Lost Horizon,&quot; starring Ronald Colman, Jane Wyatt and Sam Jaffe, the latter of which, he arranged the music of Dimitri Tiomkin. Still was also hired to arrange music for the 1943 film &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, but left because &quot;Twentieth-Century Fox &#x27;degraded colored people.&#x27;&quot;

For the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Still composed &quot;Song of a City&quot; for the exhibit &quot;Democracity,&quot; which played continuously during the fair&#x27;s run. Despite writing music for the fair, he was unable to attend the fair without police protection except on &quot;Negro Day&quot;.

A decade after its original composition, his opera &quot;Troubled Island&quot; about Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Haiti, was performed in 1949 by the New York City Opera. It is the first opera by an American to be performed by the company. It also is the first opera by an African American to be performed by a major company. Still was, however, upset by the negative reviews it received.

Still&#x27;s works were performed internationally by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, and the BBC Orchestra.

Still was the first African American to conduct a major orchestra in the Deep South, doing so in 1955, where he conducted the New Orleans Philharmonic Orchestra.

He died in Los Angeles in 1978. Three years after his death, &quot;A Bayou Legend&quot; became the first opera by an African-American composer to be performed on national television.

<text>Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS) () is one of the leading South Korean television and radio broadcasters. The broadcaster legally became known as SBS in March 2000, changing its corporate name from Seoul Broadcasting System (). Its flagship terrestrial television station SBS TV broadcasts as channel 6 for digital and cable.

Established on 14 November 1990, SBS is the largest private broadcaster in South Korea, and is owned by the Taeyoung Construction. It operates its flagship television channel which has a nationwide network of 10 regional stations, and three radio networks. SBS has provided digital terrestrial television service in the ATSC format since 2001, and T-DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) service since 2005.

==History==
After South Korea&#x27;s democratic reform in 1987, the government moved to create a new commercial broadcaster in South Korea, the second after the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC). Unlike MBC, previously a part of the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) broadcasting sporting events like the 1986 FIFA World Cup, the new commercial broadcaster was to become a broad alternative channel for the public. The Korean government announced in June 1990 that it would allow licenses to the private sector again, after ten years of hiatus. This was also seen as a counterweight to the start of NHK BS1, which was received in Korea, and was seen as controversial by pundits over trauma from the Japanese occupation in the first half of the century.

SBS was founded in Seoul on 14 November 1990, and marked its establishment with initial experimental demo broadcasts, with test transmissions for its TV and radio channels following on 1 December 1990. This move was met with some criticism, due to its connections with the Taeyoung construction corporation, who owned 30% of the shares. The Hankook Ilbo even called the affair &quot;the scandal of the Sixth Republic&quot;. On 20 March 1991, SBS started its regular broadcasts, launching SBS Radio&#x27;s first regular broadcast on AM 792kHz. On 1 December 1991, the 30th anniversary of MBC, SBS commenced its official broadcasts with the introduction of SBS TV at 10:00am in Seoul, designated as &quot;The Day of Birth of SBS&quot;, as broadcast by MBC on the program MBC Newsdesk. 

Initially, SBS was only broadcast terrestrially in Seoul and its surrounding areas. On 9 October 1992, the government began accepting applications for private broadcasting stations in other regions of the country. SBS planned for a television and radio broadcast affiliate network to air SBS programs on other new regional channels before its 5th anniversary. In 1994, the private Korea New Network (KNN) in Busan, Taejon Broadcasting Corporation (TJB) in Daejeon, Daegu Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) in Daegu, and Kwangju Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) in Gwangju were created, after government approval. On 14 May 1995, SBS launched its national television network with new local affiliates, KNN, TJB, TBC, and KBC, airing SBS programming on the regional channels while local stations created local programming to suit the local residents needs.

In 1996, an FM radio station was established to complement the existing AM station. On 14 November 1996, SBS Power FM began broadcasting on 107.7 MHz as a music-centric station. On 4 January 1999, the original SBS Radio on AM 792 kHz began broadcasting on FM as well. The station rebranded as SBS Love FM on 103.5 MHz, broadcasting simultaneously on AM and FM frequencies. High-definition digital television was introduced in 2001. Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) was introduced in 2005.

SBS introduced its current logo on 14 November 2000, after its 10th anniversary celebration entitled &quot;SBS 10th Anniversary Special: Thank You, Viewers&quot;. SBS also used the slogan &quot;Humanism thru Digital&quot; until January 2010, when a new slogan was introduced: &quot;Together, we make delight&quot;. On 29 October 2012, SBS TV became South Korea&#x27;s second channel to broadcast 24 hours a day. However, this was discontinued in 2017, and the channel has reverted to daily sign-off routines overnight.

It also produces news-analysis programs such as &quot;Morning Wide&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;SBS Current Affairs Debate&quot;, &quot;Curious Stories Y&quot;, and &quot;In Depth 21&quot; covering the political, economic, social and cultural issues of the days.

In 2012 he was redesigned taking into account the growing digital media environment. In conjunction with the redesign, friends were added, Gorilla (고릴라), who is interested in music, Looly (룰리), a tall green bear who helps Komi, Poly (폴리), a problem-solving know-it-all purple penguin and Tory (토리), a pink rabbit with a youthful personality.

<text>Charlotte &quot;Lotte&quot; Reiniger (2 June 1899 – 19 June 1981) was a German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation. Her best known films are &quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed&quot;, from 1926, the oldest surviving feature-length animated film, and &quot;Papageno&quot; (1935). Reiniger is also noted for having devised, from 1923 to 1926, the first form of a multiplane camera, one of the most important devices in pre digital animation. Reiniger worked on more than 40 films throughout her career.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Lotte Reiniger was born in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin on 2 June 1899 to Carl Reiniger and Eleonore Lina Wilhelmine Rakette. Here, she studied at Charlottenburger Waldschule, the first open-air school, where she learned the art of scherenschnitte, the German art of silhouette, inspired by the ancient Chinese art of paper cutting and silhouette puppetry. As a child, she became fascinated with this Chinese art of paper cutting of silhouette puppetry, and even built her own puppet theatre so that she could put on shows for her family and friends. Throughout this time in her life is when she began to develop a love of theater and cultivated her then dreams of becoming a play actress. Reiniger translated her love of acting to her silhouette puppetry in order to create her unique and fanciful recreations of her favorite plays and fairytales.

As a teenager, Reiniger developed a love of cinema, first with the films of Georges Méliès for their special effects, then the films of the actor and director Paul Wegener, a German actor, writer, and film director known for his pioneering role in German expressionist cinema and &quot;The Golem&quot; (1920). In 1915, her love of theater led Reiniger to her future mentor and colleague when she attended a lecture by Wegener that focused on the fantastic possibilities of animation. Reiniger eventually convinced her parents to allow her to enroll in the acting group to which Wegener belonged, the Theatre of Max Reinhardt. She began by making costumes and props and working backstage for Wegener&#x27;s play productions. She started making silhouette portraits of her classmates and the actors around her, which intrigued Paul Wegener and led to her future collaborations with the director. Soon enough she was making elaborate title cards for Wegener&#x27;s films, many of which featured her silhouette animations.

=== Adulthood and success ===
In 1918, Reiniger animated wooden rats and created the animated intertitles for Wegener&#x27;s &quot;Der Rattenfänger von Hameln&quot; (&quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;). The success of this work got her admitted into the Institut für Kulturforschung (Institute for Cultural Research), an experimental animation and short-film studio. It was here that she met her future creative partner and husband (from 1921), Carl Koch, as well as other avant-garde artists including Hans Cürlis, Bertolt Brecht, and Berthold Bartosch. She began animating films of her own.

The first film Reiniger directed was &quot;Das Ornament des verliebten Herzens&quot; (&quot;The Ornament of the Enamoured Heart&quot;, 1919), a five-minute piece involving two lovers and an ornament that reflects their moods. The film was an early showcase for Reiniger&#x27;s style of expression through movement. The film was very well received, and its success opened up many new connections for Reiniger in the animation industry, not just in Germany but internationally as well. She continued to work on short films and advertisements during this time.
She made six short films over the next few years, all produced and photographed by her husband, including the fairytale animation &quot;Aschenputtel&quot; (1922), based on the Brothers Grimm telling of Cinderella. These shorts were interspersed with advertising films (the Julius Pinschewer advertising agency sponsored a large number of abstract animators during the Weimar period) and special effects for various feature films—most famously a silhouette falcon for a dream sequence in Part One of &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; by Fritz Lang. During this time, she found herself at the centre of a large group of ambitious German animators, including Bartosch, Hans Richter, Walter Ruttmann and Oskar Fischinger.
In 1923, she was approached by Louis Hagen, who had bought a large quantity of raw film stock as an investment to fight the spiraling inflation of the period. He asked her to make a feature-length animated film. Reiniger later recalled, &quot;We had to think twice. This was a never heard of thing. Animated films were supposed to make people roar with laughter, and nobody had dared to entertain an audience with them for more than ten minutes. Everybody to whom we talked in the industry about the proposition was horrified.&quot; The resulting film was &quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed,&quot; based on &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. Completed in 1926, &quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed&quot; is believed to be the oldest surviving feature-length animated film, debuting over a decade prior to Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.&quot; (It was predated by Argentine director Quirino Cristiani&#x27;s &quot;The Apostol,&quot; released in 1917, but no copies of this film are known to survive.) Although it failed to find a distributor for almost a year, once premiered in Paris (thanks to the support of Jean Renoir), it became a critical and popular success.

Reiniger developed a predecessor to the multiplane camera for certain effects. As described in Reiniger&#x27;s book &quot;Shadow Puppets, Shadow Theatres, and Shadow Films,&quot; she placed backlit planes of glass in front of a camera with a manual shutter to achieve a layered effect. Again, she presaged Disney; only in the 1930s would Disney and Ub Iwerks develop the version of the multiplane camera that would become a mainstay of traditional animation. In addition to Reiniger&#x27;s silhouette characters, &quot;Prince Achmed&quot; featured dream-like backgrounds by Walter Ruttmann (her partner in the &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; sequence) and Walter Türck, and a symphonic score by Wolfgang Zeller. Additional effects were added by Carl Koch and Berthold Bartosch.

Following the success of &quot;Prince Achmed,&quot; Reiniger was able to make a second feature. &quot;Doktor Dolittle und seine Tiere&quot; (&quot;Doctor Dolittle and his Animals&quot;, 1928) was based on the first of the English children&#x27;s books by Hugh Lofting. The film tells of the doctor&#x27;s voyage to Africa to help heal sick animals. It is currently available only in a television version with new music, voice-over narration, and a high framerate. The score of this three-part film was composed by Kurt Weill, Paul Hindemith and Paul Dessau.

A year later, Reiniger co-directed her first live-action film with Rochus Gliese, &quot;Die Jagd nach dem Glück&quot; (&quot;The Pursuit of Happiness&quot;, 1929), a tale about a shadow-puppet troupe. The film starred Jean Renoir and Berthold Bartosch and included a 20-minute silhouette performance by Reiniger. The film was completed just as sound came to Germany, and release of the film was delayed until 1930 to dub in voices by different actors.

Reiniger attempted to make a third animated feature, inspired by Maurice Ravel&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot; (&quot;The Child and the Bewitched Things&quot;, 1925), but was unable to clear all of the individual rights to Ravel&#x27;s music, the libretto (by the novelist Colette), and an unexpected number of copyright holders. When Ravel died in 1937, the clearance became even more complex and Reiniger finally abandoned the project, although she had designed sequences and animated some scenes to convince potential backers and the rights-holders.

Reiniger worked on several films with British poet, critic, and musician Eric Walter White, who wrote an early book-length essay on her work.

===Flight from Germany and later life===
With the rise of the Nazi Party, Reiniger and Koch decided to emigrate (both were involved in left-wing politics), but found that no other country would give them permanent visas. As a result, the couple spent the years 1933–1944 moving from country to country, staying as long as visas would allow. With the release of sound film, Reiniger and her husband began to work with music in relation to animation. They worked with film-makers Jean Renoir in Paris and Luchino Visconti in Rome. They managed to make 12 films during this period, the best-known being &quot;Carmen&quot; (1933) and &quot;Papageno&quot; (1935), both based on popular operas (Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;). When World War II commenced they stayed with Visconti in Rome until 1944, then moved back to Berlin to take care of Reiniger&#x27;s sick mother. Under the rule of Hitler, Reiniger was forced to make propaganda films for Germany. One of these films is called (The Golden Goose, 1944). She had to work under stringent and limiting conditions to please the German state, which is why some of her work in this time period may appear creatively stifled.
In 1949, Reiniger and Koch moved to London, where she made a few short advertising films for John Grierson and his General Post Office Film Unit (later to be renamed the &quot;Crown Film Unit&quot;). By 1953, Reiniger had founded Primrose Production with Louis Hagen Jr., the son of the financier of Prince Achmed. With this company, she made over a dozen short silhouette films based on Grimms’ Fairy Tales for the BBC and Telecasting America. Reiniger continued to work on and off over the years, her last film being &#x27;The Rose and the Ring,&#x27; released in 1979.

In the early 1950s, Reiniger lived in London and worked at Beconsfield Studios in Buckinghamshire. During this time, she became friends with Freddy Bloom, the chair of the National Deaf Children&#x27;s Society and editor of quarterly magazine called &quot;TALK,&quot; for which she designed a logo that was used until the 1990s.

With Louis Hagen Jr. (the son of Reiniger&#x27;s financier of &quot;Prince Achmed&quot; in Potsdam), they founded Primrose Productions in 1953 and, over the next two years, produced more than a dozen short silhouette films based on &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; for the BBC and Telecasting America. Reiniger also provided illustrations for the 1953 book &quot;King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table&quot; by Roger Lancelyn Green.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanks, Apollo, 10/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of seclusion after her husband&#x27;s death in 1963, renewed interest in her work resulted in Reiniger&#x27;s return to Germany. She later visited the United States, and began making films again soon after. She made three more films, the last of which, &quot;Die vier Jahreszeiten,&quot; (The Four Seasons) was completed the year before she died.
Reiniger was awarded the of the Deutscher Filmpreis in 1972; in 1979 she received the Great Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. Reiniger died in Dettenhausen, Germany, on 19 June 1981, at the age of 82.

== Art style ==
Reiniger&#x27;s art style was developed from her love of paper animation and the theater. Reiniger had a distinct art style in her animations that was very different from other artists in the time period of the 1920s and the 1930s, particularly in terms of characters.
In the 1920s especially, characters tended to rely on facial expressions to express emotions or action, while Reiniger&#x27;s characters relied on gestures to display emotions or actions. Reiniger&#x27;s cutout animations had a fluid quality that expressed characters&#x27; emotions and actions in a way that was not possible through traditional silent film. This was due to the unique way she shaped and animated her characters through the paper cutout techniques that she developed through practice. Because paper animations were forced to rely on gestures and action due to the nature of the medium, Reiniger was able to convey emotion that facial expressions or sound film could not imitate. Because of this, Reiniger&#x27;s characters are not usually anatomically correct, but they are able to express a fluidity which is very important to her style of expressionism. Although there are other animators in that time period that used these techniques, Reiniger stands out because she is able to accomplish this style using cutout animation. Reiniger&#x27;s figures resemble stop-motion animation in the way that they move.

She also utilized the technique of metamorphosis often in her animations. This focus on transformation greatly benefits her tendency to work with fairytale stories. &quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed&quot; specifically adapts fantastic elements to take advantage of animation to show things that could not be shown in reality. Reiniger considered animation&#x27;s separation from the laws of the material plane to be one of the greatest strengths of the medium.

Reiniger&#x27;s style also translated well to her usually chosen subject, Fairytales. At the time film did not have the technological advancements to create magical special effects, thus many fairytales that showcased extravagant magical events were not as desirable for filmmakers. However, through animation, such whimsical effects were possible through her paper animations. Her detailed settings and colourful backgrounds also translated well into her love of fairytale stories.

== Influence ==

Lotte Reiniger’s work was influenced by several sources. Following her escape from Germany, her travels throughout Europe continued to shape the course of her work. While in Greece she studied the Greek puppet show Karagiozis. Karagiozis is a traditional character in Greek folklore whose stories are performed through puppetry and traditionally with shadow puppets. The influence of Karagiozis can be seen in Reiniger’s work where the subject of many of her films are long established fairy tale stories that have been enjoyed by generations of children and adults alike.

The influence of traditional Chinese shadow puppetry is also one of the defining characteristics of Reiniger’s work. Chinese puppetry dates back to the Han dynasty but their methods of puppetry are clearly reflected in Reiniger’s techniques. Chinese shadow puppets were historically made using donkey skin and treated to be translucent. They were then mounted using iron wire and bamboo sticks as handles. Reiniger’s puppets were made from tracing paper and cardboard, and sometimes included 20-50 separate pieces that were fused together with lead wire.

Aside from the origins of her technical inspiration, her subjects were often influenced by operatic themes. Music was the driving force behind many of the storylines as well as the movements and actions of the puppets. She used the music of composers such as Mozart, Bizet, and Offenbach, as well as contemporary artists like Paul Dessau and Wolfgang Zeller. Jean Renoir, a good friend of Reiniger&#x27;s, once described her work as &quot;visual expression of Mozart&#x27;s music&quot;.

== Legacy, honors, and preservation==

Reiniger&#x27;s black silhouettes would become a popular aesthetic to reference in films and art. Films and television shows such as &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1&quot;, &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, and &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; all make reference to Reiniger’s style with extended animated silhouette puppet sequences. French animator Michel Ocelot has extensively shown Reiniger’s influence on his work, beginning with the 1989 television series &quot;Ciné si&quot;, which employs many of the techniques created by Reiniger, along with others of Ocelot’s own invention. Ocelot’s films, such as &quot;Princes et princesses&quot;, &quot;The Three Inventors&quot;, and &quot;Kirikou and the Sorceress&quot; showcase character designs and layouts deeply inspired by Reiniger.

Walt Disney Animation Studios used the multiplane camera extensively in films such as &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;The Old Mill&quot;, based on the technology that Reiniger originally developed.

Reiniger&#x27;s films were the first to move animation from solely comedic narratives. At the time, animated short films rarely had a narrative, and any narrative that they did have was shallow and only present in the film to support the character’s slapstick comedy. Throughout all of her films, both short and feature length, Reininger strives to portray serious narrative through the art of animation. Thus, gaining a much larger respect for the medium in the film industry.

Reiniger served to be one of the first filmmakers in the 20th century to attempt a portrayal of the queer experience with a pair of openly gay lovers in her film &quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed.&quot; Although this was censored in the version of the film that was distributed to theaters, Reiniger herself was outspoken on her motivation to destigmatize homosexual realities in the world of film. “I knew lots of homosexual men and women from the film and theater world in Berlin, and saw how they suffered from stigmatization.”

In 2017, the European Animation Awards created the Lotte Reiniger Lifetime Achievement Award in order to recognize individuals for their lifetime contribution to the art of animation in either producing, directing, animating, design, writing, voice acting, sound and sound effects, technical work, music, professional teaching, or for other endeavors which exhibit an outstanding contribution to excellence in animation. The very first recipient of this award was Richard Williams, the animation director of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; and author of &quot;The Animator&#x27;s Survival Kit&quot;.

The municipal museum in Tübingen holds much of her original materials and hosts a permanent exhibition, &quot;The World in Light and Shadow: Silhouette, shadow theatre, silhouette film&quot;. The Filmmuseum Düsseldorf also holds many materials of Lotte Reiniger&#x27;s work, including her animation table, and a part of the permanent exhibition is dedicated to her. Collections relating to her are also held at the BFI National Archive.

On June 2, 2016, Google celebrated Reiniger&#x27;s 117th birthday with a Google Doodle about her.

The Lottie file format for vector animation, which is considered by many designers to be the best website animation format, is named for Reiniger.

In 2024, Reiniger was posthumously awarded the Winsor McCay Award at that year’s Annie Awards in recognition of her “unparalleled achievement and exceptional contributions to animation”.

<text>World Airways, Inc. was an American airline headquartered in Peachtree City, Georgia in Greater Atlanta. During the regulated era that ended 1978, World was a supplemental air carrier. After US airline deregulation in 1979, the company operated mostly non-scheduled services but did fly scheduled passenger services as well, notably with McDonnell Douglas DC-10 wide body jetliners. World Airways ceased all operations on March 27, 2014.

==History==
World Airways was founded on March 29, 1948 by Benjamin Pepper with the introduction of ex-Pan Am Boeing 314 flying boats. Edward Daly, however, is thought of as World&#x27;s founder. He bought the airline in 1950 for $50,000 and proceeded to acquire DC-4s.

World Airways started as a supplemental air carrier, the term used by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to denote charter carriers. The CAB was the US government agency that tightly regulated the US airline industry until 1978. In fact, prior to 1955, the CAB referred to such carriers, including World Airways, as &quot;irregular air carriers&quot;. Under either name, World was barred by the CAB from offering scheduled service. After US airline deregulation in 1979, World gained the right to fly scheduled flights, and did so for a time, as detailed below.

World got its first government contract in 1951 and had a substantial amount of government business throughout the rest of its operational history.

Later, World acquired DC-6s and Lockheed Constellations. World entered the jet era in the late 1960s with Boeing 707s and 727s. In the early 1970s, World acquired Douglas DC-8s.

World became a key military contractor during the Vietnam War, flying troops and equipment between the war zone and World&#x27;s base at Oakland International Airport. On March 29, 1975, World operated the last airlift flight out of Đà Nẵng, Vietnam. Two 727s were flown to Đà Nẵng, one of which had Ed Daly aboard. Thousands rushed the airplane and it took off on a taxiway under heavy fire. The aircraft with Daly aboard started its takeoff roll with the 727&#x27;s back airstairs still down with Daly fending off additional people trying to leave due to over capacity (The film of this was later broadcast on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; on March 30, 1975). When the airplane landed at Saigon, there were 268 people in the cabin and possibly 60 or more in the cargo holds. World did not return to Đà Nẵng until April 17, 2002, then with an MD-11 aircraft to pick up a team of people resolving Missing-In-Action cases from the Vietnam War.

In the early 1970s through the early 1980s, World operated three Boeing 747 aircraft and was the launch customer for the &quot;flip nose&quot; front-loading variant of the 747. Later, World acquired DC-10s that were eventually retired in 2010.

In 1986 slots for lucrative routes on the east coast became available, and with the competitive nature for these routes, they were offered to interested airlines in the form of a lottery, or what was called the “Slottery”. World was awarded three city pairs: Boston, Washington National, and New York LaGuardia. In order to acquire these slots, the routes had to be operated for at least three months. World&#x27;s intention was to sell the routes for a profit to another airline rather than establishing their own operation on these routes, so the company operated fully crewed Boeing 727s (flight deck and cabin crew) without passengers, flying between the scheduled city pairs with touch and go landings and takeoffs. As planned, the routes were then sold for profit. World experienced heavy losses in the 1980s as a result of operating scheduled passenger services, ending scheduled service September 15, 1986. In 1987, the company moved its headquarters from Oakland to Washington Dulles International Airport, acquired Key Airlines from Bain Capital&#x27;s Presidential Airways, and established ties to Malaysia Airlines. World was burdened financially as its cash was siphoned off by parent WorldCorp to support a telecommunications venture in which the parent had invested. During the first Persian Gulf War, World did a substantial amount of profitable business for the military, enabling the addition of the MD-11 to the fleet. During the mid-1990s, World operated the military passenger trunk route from Osan Air Base, Korea and Kadena Air Base, Okinawa to Los Angeles, using MD-11 aircraft. World has been headquartered near Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport.

The airline received a substantial amount of its business from the military, especially in its role connecting American bases in the U.S. to the Middle East. It also thrived on passenger and freight contracts with private organizations, such as the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League, as well as wet leases to other airlines. With such wet lease arrangements, World Airways essentially functioned as a cargo airline arm of another airline for whom a separate division would not be an efficient use of resources.

In 2006, World Airways became a subsidiary of World Air Holdings, Inc. On April 5, 2007, World Airways returned to its Oakland and Bay Area roots where they were headquartered from 1956 to 1987. It was later acquired by ATA Holdings, which was renamed Global Aero Logistics, in a transaction valued at $315 million. With this, ATA&#x27;s president, Subodh Karnik became the head of all three certificated airlines autonomous operations, ATA Airlines, North American Airlines, and World Airways. In 2007 GAL moved its operation to the World Airways building in Peachtree City, Georgia. Robert Binns was named chief executive officer of GAL in April 2008 and Charlie McDonald was named president. Larry Montford became COO of World Airways.

On March 27, 2014, World Airways announced the immediate cessation of all operations. At the time of its closure, World&#x27;s fleet consisted of MD-11 trijet aircraft both in freighter and passenger configurations and of 747-400 freighters.

On November 8, 2017, investment firm 777 Partners, announced it had acquired the intellectual property of World Airways, Inc. and planned to relaunch the airline as a low cost international carrier with a fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The new airline was to be based at Miami International Airport with MIA and Los Angeles International Airport as initial operating hubs.

==Scheduled passenger service==

World Airways operated scheduled international and domestic passenger service with its McDonnell Douglas DC-10 wide body jetliners, the Boeing 747-200, as well as Boeing 727 jets. Scheduled service began in the late 1970s with airline deregulation, starting April 11, 1979, ending September 15, 1986. Crew bases included Wrightstown, NJ (WRI-closed), Oakland, CA (OAK-company headquarters), Los Angeles, CA (LAX), Baltimore, MD (BWI), and later San Francisco, CA (SFO). The company theme song in the early 1980s, featured at the beginning of the onboard aircraft safety videos and used for advertising, had an instrumental version that played on an easy listening radio station in the San Francisco Bay Area until new advertising was introduced in 1985. The Airline revisited scheduled service in 1996 with the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft, but this was short lived. Destinations served included:

* Baltimore, MD (BWI)
* Frankfurt, Germany (FRA)
* Honolulu, HI (HNL)
* Kansas City, MO (MCI)
* London, England (LGW)
* Los Angeles, CA (LAX)
* Newark, NJ (EWR)
* Oakland, CA (OAK)
* Orlando, FL (MCO)
* San Francisco, CA (SFO)
* Boston, MA - (BOS)
* San Juan, PR - (SJU)

==Fleet==

As of March 2014, the World Airways fleet consisted of the following aircraft, with an average fleet age of 19.8 years:

===Historical fleet===
World Airways also previously operated the following aircraft types during its existence:

==Corporate headquarters==
World Airways&#x27;s corporate headquarters were in Peachtree City, Georgia in Greater Atlanta.

In 1956, World Airways relocated its headquarters from the Teterboro, New Jersey to the grounds of Oakland International Airport (OAK) in Oakland, California in the San Francisco Bay Area. World Airways built the World Air Center at Oakland, which served as the company headquarters and maintenance facilities from 1973 through 1986. The World Air Center hangar was able to accommodate four 747s and provided maintenance services to other carriers, as well as the U.S. military. In 1987, headquarters moved to unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near Herndon, in Greater Washington DC. In 2001 World Airways relocated to Peachtree City from Fairfax County.

<text>The Late Great Planet Earth is a 1970 book by Hal Lindsey, with contributions by Carole C. Carlson, first published by Zondervan. &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared it to be the bestselling nonfiction book of the 1970s. The book was first featured on a primetime television special featuring Hal Lindsey in 1974 and 1975 with an audience of 17 million and produced by Alan Hauge of GMT Productions. It was adapted by Rolf Forsberg and Robert Amram into a 1978 film narrated by Orson Welles and released by Pacific International Enterprises.

==Description==
&quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; is a treatment of dispensational premillennialism. As such, it compared end-time prophecies in the Bible with then-current events in an attempt to predict future scenarios resulting in the rapture of believers before the Great Tribulation and Second Coming of Jesus to establish his thousand-year (i.e. millennial) kingdom on Earth. Emphasizing various passages in the books of Daniel, Ezekiel and Revelation, Lindsey originally suggested the possibility that these climactic events might occur during the 1980s, which he interpreted as one generation from the foundation of modern Israel during 1948, a major event according to some conservative evangelical schools of eschatological thought. Cover art of the Bantam edition suggested that the 1970s were the &quot;era of the Antichrist as foretold by Moses and Jesus,&quot; and termed the book &quot;a penetrating look at incredible ancient prophecies involving this generation.&quot; Descriptions of alleged &quot;fulfilled&quot; prophecy were offered as proof of the infallibility of God&#x27;s word, and evidence that &quot;unfulfilled&quot; prophecies would soon find their denouement in God&#x27;s plan for the planet.

He cited an increase in the frequency of famines, wars and earthquakes, as major events just prior to the end of the world. He also foretold a Soviet invasion of Israel (War of Gog and Magog). Lindsey also predicted that the European Economic Community, which preceded the European Union, was destined (according to Biblical prophecy) to become a &quot;United States of Europe&quot;, which in turn he says is destined to become a &quot;Revived Roman Empire&quot; ruled by the Antichrist. Lindsey wrote that he had concluded, since there was no apparent mention of America in the books of Daniel or Revelation, that America would not be a major geopolitical power by the time the tribulations of the end times arrived. He found little in the Bible that could represent the U.S., but he suggested that could be speaking of the U.S. in part.

Although Lindsey did not claim to know the dates of future events with any certainty, he suggested that indicated that Jesus&#x27; return might be within &quot;one generation&quot; of the rebirth of the state of Israel, and the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple, and Lindsey asserted that &quot;in the Bible&quot; one generation is forty years. Some readers accepted this as an indication that the Tribulation or the Rapture would occur no later than 1988. In his 1980 work &quot;The 1980s: Countdown to Armageddon&quot;, Lindsey predicted that &quot;the decade of the 1980s could very well be the last decade of history as we know it&quot;.

&quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; was the first Christian prophecy book to be published by a secular publisher (Bantam, 1973) and sell many copies. 28 million copies had sold by 1990.

==Film adaptation==
The film version was narrated by Orson Welles and released in theaters in January 1978.

Welles opens by providing background information on the importance of prophets such as Jeremiah, Isaiah, Ezekiel and Amos in foretelling the arrival of Jesus as the Messiah. He also describes the visions of John of Patmos.

Hal Lindsey makes multiple appearances providing Biblical context to historical and then-current events, linking them to Biblical prophecy. He focuses on three key events prior to the arrival of the Antichrist:

# The establishment of Israel in 1948.
# Jerusalem&#x27;s return to Israeli hands in 1967.
# The restoration of the Temple of Solomon at some point in the near future.

==Reception of the film==
===Critical===
&quot;People&quot; magazine said, &quot;Lindsey splices Bible prophecies of doom with contemporary signs. For instance, he says the Bible pinpoints Israel&#x27;s rebirth as a nation as the catalyst to Judgment Day, which will probably occur by 1988. The intervening years will see the emergence of a 10-nation confederacy (prophet Daniel&#x27;s dreadful 10-horned beast) or, as Lindsey sees it, the European Common Market. Eventually Russia (biblical Magog) will attack Israel and precipitate a global nuclear war. Only Jesus&#x27; followers will be spared. Hence, Lindsey advises, &quot;the only thing you need to understand is that God offers you in Jesus Christ a full pardon.&quot;

Marc Jacobson wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;Therein lies the major fault of &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;. To me, the Apocalypse is an intensely personal thing. I really don&#x27;t need some self-help creep handing out a cover version. Every thinking human can and should conjure up his own version of doom, just like the graybeards in the Bible did. Screw ecologists. I stand with Carl Sandburg—a factory is as beautiful as a tree. Nuclear power doesn&#x27;t scare me either. Not at all. I like watching slow-motion films of mushroom clouds; they have a restful, narcotic effect on me. Some day I hope to watch a four-hour VTR tape of A-bomb explosions on a seven-foot TV screen as I drink beer. In fact, I think it&#x27;s fair to say I have a love-hate relationship with nuclear holocaust.&quot;

===Box office===
Franklin Harris of &quot;Splice Today&quot; wrote, &quot;Coming nine years after Lindsey&#x27;s book, the movie version of &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; was late to its own party&quot;. &quot;The Omen&quot; had already turned the Apocalypse into big-budget summer spectacle in 1976, and the steam was running out of the pseudo-historical documentary genre pioneered by Sunn Classic Pictures, which released &quot;In Search of Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;, and &quot;The Lincoln Conspiracy&quot;. But &quot;The Omen&quot; was the No. 4 movie at the domestic box office in 1976, raking in $60.1 million. The No. 5 movie was, improbably, &quot;In Search of Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, with a domestic tally of $55.7 million. So, the producers of &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; figured there was still money to be made. There was, although not nearly as much: in 1978, &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; grossed $19.5 million domestically against an estimated budget of $11 million.&quot;

Another account said it made $5.25 million.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, &quot;The efficacy of the film&#x27;s scare tactics is minimized by its applying biblical predictions too generally, and almost cavalierly at times – the most memorable sequence shows a computer conducting a numerological analysis of various politicians&#x27; names, to figure out if Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan or Ted Kennedy is the Antichrist. And Hal Lindsey, who co-wrote the book upon which the film is based and who appears with Mr. Welles as a co-narrator, speaks coolly, almost enthusiastically, about the prospect of worldwide destruction.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The book was an influence on the depiction of the Rapture in 1970s evangelical horror film &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot; and its sequels, which became influential in their own right.

<doc id="341984" wikidata="Q27220" url="?curid=341984" title="Corn bunting">
<text>The corn bunting (Emberiza calandra) is a passerine bird in the bunting family Emberizidae, a group now separated by most modern authors from the finches, Fringillidae. This is a large bunting with heavily streaked buff-brown plumage. The sexes are similar but the male is slightly larger than the female. Its range extends from Western Europe and North Africa across to northwestern China.

==Taxonomy==
The corn bunting was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and retains its original binomial name of &quot;Emberiza calandra&quot;. The type locality is Sweden. The genus name &quot;Emberiza&quot; is from Old German &quot;Embritz&quot;, a bunting. The specific &quot;calandra&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalandros&quot;, the calandra lark. The corn bunting has sometimes been placed in its own monotypic genus &quot;Miliaria&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;E. c. calandra&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – northwest Africa, Canary Islands and Europe to Turkey, the Caucasus and north Iran
* &quot;E. c. buturlini&quot; Johansen, HE, 1907 – Middle East to northwest China

==Description==

This is an unusual bunting because the plumages of the sexes are similar in appearance, though the male is approximately 20% larger than the female. This large bulky bunting is 16–19 cm long, with a conspicuously dark eye and yellowish mandibles. Males lack any showy colours, especially on the head, which is otherwise typical of genus &quot;Emberiza&quot;. Both sexes look something like larks, being streaked grey-brown above with whitish underparts. The underparts are streaked over the flanks and breast, and the streaking forms gorget around the throat. The lesser wing coverts are distinctively dark and white-tipped. The tail is plain brown.

The song of the male is a repetitive metallic sound, usually likened to jangling keys, which is given from a low bush, fence post or telephone wires.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds across southern and central Europe, north Africa and Asia across to Kazakhstan. It is mainly resident, but some birds from colder regions of central Europe and Asia migrate southwards in winter.

The corn bunting is a bird of open country with trees, such as farmland and weedy wasteland. It has declined greatly in north-west Europe due to intensive agricultural practices depriving it of its food supply of weed seeds and insects, the latter especially vital when feeding the young. It has recently become extinct in Wales and Ireland, where it was previously common.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Food and feeding===
Its natural food consists mainly of seeds but also includes insects such as crickets, especially when feeding young.

===Breeding===
Males defend territories in the breeding season and can be polygynous, with up to three females per breeding male. The population sex ratio is generally 1:1, which means some males remain unmated during a season. Males play only a small role in parental care; they are not involved in nest building or incubation, and only feed the chicks when they are over half grown.

The nest is made of grass, lined with hair or fine grass, and is usually built on the ground. Average clutch size is four, but commonly varies from three to five, occasionally six.

==Status and conservation==
In England, the government&#x27;s environmental organisation Natural England offers grants towards implementing measures to conserve this species, under the environmental stewardship scheme.

<text>Personal finance is the financial management that an individual or a family unit performs to budget, save, and spend monetary resources in a controlled manner, taking into account various financial risks and future life events.

When planning personal finances, the individual would take into account the suitability of various banking products (checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, and loans), insurance products (health insurance, disability insurance, life insurance, etc.), and investment products (bonds, stocks, real estate, etc.), as well as participation in monitoring and management of credit scores, income taxes, retirement funds and pensions.

== History ==
Before a specialty in personal finance was developed, various disciplines which are closely related to it, such as family economics, and consumer economics, were taught in various colleges as part of home economics for over 100 years.

The earliest known research in personal finance was done in 1920 by Hazel Kyrk. Her dissertation at University of Chicago laid the foundation of consumer economics and family economics. Margaret Reid, a professor of Home Economics at the same university, is recognized as one of the pioneers in the study of consumer behavior and Household behavior.

In 1947, Herbert A. Simon, a Nobel laureate, suggested that a decision-maker did not always make the best financial decision because of limited educational resources and personal inclinations. In 2009, Dan Ariely suggested the 2008 financial crisis showed that human beings do not always make rational financial decisions, and the market is not necessarily automated and corrective of any imbalances in the economy.

Research into personal finance is based on several theories, such as social exchange theory and andragogy (adult learning theory). In America, professional bodies such as American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences and the American Council on Consumer Interests started to play an important role in developing this field from the 1950s to the 1970s. The establishment of the Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education (AFCPE) in 1984 at Iowa State University and the Academy of Financial Services (AFS) in 1985 marked an important milestone in personal finance history in the US. Attendances of the two societies mainly come from faculty and graduates from business and home economics colleges. AFCPE started to offered several certifications for professionals in this field, such as Accredited Financial Counselor (AFC) and Certified Housing Counselor (CHC). Meanwhile, AFS cooperates with Certified Financial Planner (CFP Board).

Before 1990, the study of personal finance received little attention from mainstream economists and business faculties. However, several American universities such as Brigham Young University, Iowa State University, and San Francisco State University started to offer financial educational programs in both undergraduate and graduate programs since the 1990s. These institutions published several works in journals such as &quot;The Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Personal Finance&quot;.

As the concerns about consumers&#x27; financial capability increased during the early 2000s, various education programs emerged, catering to a broad audience or a specific group of people, such as youth and women. The educational programs are frequently known as &quot;financial literacy&quot;. However, there was no standardized curriculum for personal finance education until after the 2008 financial crisis. The United States President&#x27;s Advisory Council on Financial Capability was set up in 2008 to encourage financial literacy among the American people. It also stressed the importance of developing a standard in financial education.

== Personal finance principles ==

It is hard to define universal personal finance principles because:

* individual situations vary significantly when it comes to income, wealth, and consumption requirements
* tax and financial regulations vary between countries
* market conditions change both geographically and over time.

A financial advisor can offer personalized advice in complicated situations and for high-wealth individuals. Still, University of Chicago professor Harold Pollack and personal finance writer Helaine Olen argue that in the United States, good personal finance advice boils down to a few simple points:
* Pay off credit card balances every month in full
* Dedicate 10-20% of post-tax income for savings and investments
* Create an emergency fund that can last at least 6 months
* Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged funds such as a 401(k) retirement funds, individual retirement accounts, and 529 education savings plans
* When investing savings:
** Avoid trading individual securities
** Look for low-cost, diversified mutual funds that balance risk vs. reward appropriately to an individual&#x27;s target retirement year
* If using a financial advisor, require them to commit to a fiduciary duty to act in an individual&#x27;s best interest

The limits stated by laws may be different in each country; in any case personal finance should not disregard correct behavioral principles and the diligence of a &quot;good family father&quot;: people should not develop attachment to the idea of money, morally reprehensible, and, when investing, should maintain the medium-long-term horizon avoiding hazards in the expected return of investment.

== Personal financial planning process ==

The key component of personal finance is financial planning which is a dynamic process requiring regular monitoring and re-evaluation. In general, it involves five steps:
# Assessment: A person&#x27;s financial situation is assessed by compiling simplified versions of financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements. A personal balance sheet lists the values of personal assets (e.g., car, house, clothes, stocks, bank account, cryptocurrencies), along with personal liabilities (e.g., credit card debt, bank loan, mortgage). A personal income statement lists personal income and expenses.
# Goal setting: Multiple goals are expected, including short- and long-term goals. For example, a long-term goal would be to &quot;retire at age 65 with a personal net worth of $1,000,000&quot;, while a short-term goal would be to &quot;save up for a new computer in the next month.&quot; Setting financial goals helps to direct financial planning by determining the parameters and expectations one aims to achieve.
# Plan creation: The financial plan details how to accomplish the financial goals set in the previous step. It could include, for example, reducing unnecessary expenses, increasing employment income, or investing in a fixed deposit.
# Execution: Execution of a financial plan often requires discipline, perseverance and sacrifice. Many people take assistance from professionals such as accountants, financial planners, investment advisers, and lawyers.
# Monitoring and reassessment: The financial plan is monitored in regular intervals to determine if one is on track to reach their goals. This information is evaluated to make potential adjustments as time passes and circumstances change.

Typical goals that most adults and young adults have are paying off credit card/student loan/housing/car loan debt, investing for retirement, investing for college costs for children, and paying medical expenses.

== Goals for personal finance ==
In the modern world, there is a growing need for people to understand and take control of their finances because of the following reasons:

1. Lack of comprehensive formal education: Although many countries have some formal education for personal finance, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) studies show low financial literacy in areas it is not required, even in developed countries like Japan.

* Personal finance in public education is not always required, with just under 30% of high schools in the US in 2024 not having personal finance as a graduation requirement.
* Graduate students with financial educations averaging higher credit scores and receiving more favorable loan conditions.
* Hence, it is essential to associate the connection of financial courses in the education system and the generational shift of personal financial educations.

This illustrates the importance of learning personal finance from an early stage, to differentiate between needs vs. wants, improve financial literacy, and to build financial planning skills..

2. Shortened employable age: Over the years, with the advent of automation and changing needs; it has been witnessed across the globe that several jobs that require manual intervention or that are mechanical are increasingly becoming redundant.

* Several employment opportunities are shifting from countries with higher labor costs to countries with lower labor costs keeping margins low for companies. 
* In economies with a considerably large younger population entering the workforce who are more equipped with the latest technologies, several employees in the middle management who have not up-skilled are easily replaceable with new and fresh talent that is cheaper and more valuable to the organizations. 
* Cyclical nature of several industries like automobile, chemicals, construction; consumption and demand is driven by the health of the countries economy. It has been observed that when economies stagnate, are in recession, and in war - specific industries suffer more than others. This results in companies rationalizing their workforce. An individual can lose their job quickly and remain unemployed for a considerable time. All these reasons bring to the realization that the legal employable age of 60 is slowly and gradually becoming shorter.

These are some of the reasons why individuals should start planning for their retirement and systematically build on their retirement corpus, hence the need for personal finance.

3. Increased life expectancy: With the developments in healthcare, people today live till a much older age than previous generations. The average life expectancy has increased even in developing economies. The average life expectancy has gradually shifted from 60 to 81 and upwards, which coupled with a shorter employable age reinforces the need for a large enough retirement corpus and the importance of personal finance.

4. Rising medical expenses: Medical expenses including cost of prescription medicine, hospital admission care and charges, nursing care, specialized care, geriatric care have all seen an exponential rise over the years. Many of these medical expenses are not covered through insurance policies that might either be private/individual insurance coverage or through federal or national insurance coverage.

* In developed markets like the US, insurance coverage is provided by either the employers, private insurers or through federal government (Medicare, primarily for senior citizens or Medicaid, primarily for individuals of lower income levels). However, with the rising US fiscal deficit and large proportion of the senior population, it needs to be seen whether the extent of the Medicare program is sustainable in the long run, therapy exclusions in the coverage, co-pay, deductibles - several cost elements are to be borne by individuals continually. 
* In other developed markets like the EU, most medical care is nationally reimbursed. This leads to the national healthcare budgets being very tightly controlled. Many newer, expensive therapies are frequently excluded from national formularies. This means that patients may not have access through the government policy and would have to pay out of pocket to avail of these medicines
* In developing countries like India, China, most of the expenses are out of pocket as there is no overarching government social security system covering medical expenses.

These reasons illustrate the need to have medical, accidental, critical illness, life coverage insurance for oneself and one&#x27;s family as well as the need for emergency corpus;.

== Areas of focus ==
Critical areas of personal financial planning, as suggested by the Financial Planning Standards Board, are:
# Financial position: Financial position is concerned with understanding the personal resources available by examining net worth and household cash flow. Net worth is a person&#x27;s balance sheet, calculated by adding up all assets under that person&#x27;s control, minus all household liabilities, at one point. Household cash flow is the total of all the expected income sources within a year minus all expected expenses within the same year. From this analysis, the financial planner can determine to what degree and when the personal goals can be accomplished.
# Adequate protection: or insurance, is the analysis of how to protect a household from unforeseen risks. These risks can be divided into liability, property, death, disability, health, and long-term care. Some wagers may be self-insurable, while most require an insurance contract. Determining how much insurance to get, at the most cost-effective terms, requires knowledge of the market for personal insurance. Business owners, professionals, athletes, and entertainers need specialized insurance professionals to protect themselves adequately. Since insurance also enjoys some tax benefits, utilizing insurance investment products may be critical to the overall investment planning.
# Tax planning: typically, the income tax is the single largest expense in a household. Managing taxes is not a question of whether or not taxes will be paid but &quot;when&quot; and &quot;how much&quot;. The government gives many incentives in the form of tax deductions and credits, which can be used to reduce the lifetime tax burden. Most modern governments use a progressive tax. As one&#x27;s income grows, a higher marginal rate of tax must be paid. Understanding how to take advantage of the myriad tax breaks when planning one&#x27;s finances can be significantly impactful.
# Investment and accumulation goals: planning how to accumulate enough money for large purchases and life events is what most people consider financial planning. Significant reasons to get assets include purchasing a house or car, starting a business, paying for education expenses, and saving for retirement.
#: Achieving these goals requires projecting their costs and when to withdraw funds. A significant risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or inflation. Using net present value calculators, the financial planner will suggest a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested in various investments. To overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to several risks. Managing these portfolio risks is often accomplished using asset allocation, which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity. This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation for stocks, bonds, cash, and alternative investments. The budget should also consider every investor&#x27;s risk profile since risk attitudes vary from person to person.
#:Depreciating Assets- One thing to consider with personal finance and net worth goals is depreciating assets. A depreciating asset is an asset that loses value over time or with use. A few examples would be the vehicle a person owns, boats, and capitalized assets. They add value to a person&#x27;s life, but unlike other assets, they do not make money and should be a class of their own. In the business world, these are depreciated over time for tax and bookkeeping purposes because their useful life runs out. This is known as accumulated depreciation, and the asset will eventually need to be replaced.
# Retirement planning is understanding how much it costs to live at retirement and developing a plan to distribute assets to meet any income shortfall. Methods for retirement plans include taking advantage of government-allowed structures to manage tax liability, including individual (IRA) structures or employer-sponsored retirement plans.
# Estate planning involves planning to disposition one&#x27;s assets after death. Typically, a tax is due to the state or federal government when one dies. Avoiding these taxes means more of one&#x27;s assets will be distributed to their heirs. One can leave their assets to family, friends, or charitable groups.
# Delayed gratification: Delayed gratification, or deferred gratification, is the ability to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. This is thought to be an important consideration in the creation of personal wealth. 
# Cash Management: It is the soul of financial planning, whether a person is an employee or planning for retirement. It is a must for every financial planner to know how much they spend before their retirement so that they can save a significant amount. This analysis is a wake-up call as many of us know our income, but very few track their expenses.
# Revisiting Written Financial Plan Regularly: Make monitoring a financial plan regularly a habit. An annual financial planning review with a professional keeps people well-positioned and informed about the required changes, if any, in personal needs or life circumstances. It would be best to be prepared for all the sudden curve balls life throws.
# Education Planning: With the growing interest in students&#x27; loans, having a proper financial plan in place is crucial. Parents often want to save for their kids but make the wrong decisions, adversely affecting the savings. We often observe that many parents give their kids expensive gifts or unintentionally endanger the opportunity to obtain the much-needed grant. Instead, one should make their kids prepare for the future and support them financially in their education.
# Real Estate Planning: Shelter is a basic human need, and as such, it is imperative that one understands how to obtain a place to live and at the same time maintain their financial security. Housing can be very complicated, with decisions regarding buying or renting, mortgages, insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance, etc. Apartment or house? That question is crucial for any individual as each option has pros and cons.
#: Buy or Rent: If a person chooses to buy a house, they can make a financial investment in a home and improve their credit score and history. Home ownership can make life more stable. The price of the house, including the down payment, monthly mortgage payment, repair and maintenance costs, HOA fees, utilities, insurance, property taxes, and other costs, are considerations. If one choose to rent a home, there is no need to worry about maintenance and real estate taxes. Moving to a different location can also be easier. Expenses for renters may include electricity, water, internet, parking, and pet fees.
#: Mortgages: When purchasing a home/real estate, it is essential to understand the options. Most people either go with a 15- or 30-year plan. The payment rate can be a fixed plan, a constant payment of the same amount over a certain period. The other is an ARM mortgage (Adjustable-Rate Mortgage). This rate can be adjusted and agreed upon to be changed in the given plan depending on mortgage rate fluctuations. Mortgage plans depend on a person&#x27;s situation, and it is essential for potential borrowers to assess their credit score and financial status when contemplating plans.
#: Location / Wants and Needs: When choosing a new home, it is essential to consider the location, along with the qualities that are desired and needed in a home. These variables can increase or decrease the price of an estate. Location-related considerations include a city or rural location, length of commute, the importance of quality public schools, level of safety, the amount of land, included amenities, proximity to family. Examples of variables that would affect the value of an estate include but are not limited to, the quality of school systems in that area, proximity to the community, shopping and entertainment/recreation, safety levels and crime rates of the neighborhood, amenities, and land size and surrounding developments. It is essential to keep all of this in mind when thinking about the future value of a home.
#Credit: A line of credit is the ability of a customer to receive goods or services prior to payment with the promise that the debt will be repaid in the future, often with interest and or fees. Credit can be acquired through a variety of means, including unsecured debts such as personal loans, student loans, and credit cards, as well as secured debts such as car loans and mortgages. Using debt as a means to purchase goods and services brings about a variety of pros and cons that the consumer must become educated on before diving in. Some examples of the benefits of using credit are as follows:
#* Building credit: A credit score is a measurement of a borrowers trustworthiness to a lender, ranging from 300-850. Improvements to one’s credit score are determined by a variety of factors, including making payments on time, keeping low outstanding balances, having credit lines open for long periods of time, applications for credit accounts, and variety of accounts open. These factors help lenders to determine the amount of money and the interest rate they are willing to grant to each individual applicant.
#* Buy now, pay later: Although saving up and using cash is often the most preferable option, many people resort to credit to make purchases before they have the funds to do so. For example, getting loans for major purchases such as houses and cars allows the borrower to use these goods while they pay them off over time.
#* Emergencies: Although an emergency fund is widely considered the best way to cover emergency expenses, credit allows those without emergency funds to temporarily offset the financial burden of an emergency.
#* Perks and Bonuses: Many lenders incentivize borrowers to use their lines of credit, such as credit cards, by offering perks such as travel kickbacks, sign-on bonuses, and purchase protections. When used properly by paying balances in full each month, these rewards allow the borrower to take advantage of perks they would not otherwise have access to through the use of debit cards. 
Although credit can provide a variety of benefits and opportunities to the borrower, it is important to fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of borrowing to ensure sound financial decisions. Using credit indiscriminately and lack of sufficient education can land an individual into debt and disadvantaged situations. Typical downsides of using credit are:

* Overuse: Due to the nature of credit, borrowers are able to spend money even when they do not have the ability to pay off. This puts the borrower in a position of financial distress where they become dependent on debt.
* Interest and Fees: Interest and fees are levied by the lender on the borrower to profit from the process of lending. By holding balances for long periods of time a borrower will accrue interest resulting in having to pay back more money than originally borrowed.
* Monthly Payments: Many lenders often require minimum payments at regular intervals to see return on their lending. If a borrower builds up high amounts of debt, these minimum payments can grow larger and become overwhelming.

== Education and tools ==


According to a survey done by Harris Interactive, 99% of the adults agreed that personal finance should be taught in schools. Financial authorities and the American federal government had offered free educational materials online to the public. However, a Bank of America poll found that 42% of adults were discouraged. In comparison, 28% of adults thought that personal finance is difficult because of the vast amount of online information. As of 2015, 17 out of 50 states in the United States require high school students to study personal finance before graduation. The effectiveness of financial education on general audience is controversial. For example, a study by Bell, Gorin, and Hogarth (2009) stated that financial education graduates were more likely to use a formal spending plan. Financially educated high school students are more likely to have a savings account with regular savings, fewer overdrafts, and more likely to pay off their credit card balances. However, another study done by Cole and Shastry (Harvard Business School, 2009) found that there were no differences in saving behaviors of people in American states with financial literacy mandate enforced and the states without a literacy mandate.

<doc id="341988" wikidata="Q467040" url="?curid=341988" title="American Statistical Association">
<text>The American Statistical Association (ASA) is the main professional organization for statisticians and related professionals in the United States. It was founded in Boston, Massachusetts on November 27, 1839, and is the second-oldest continuously operating professional society in the U.S. behind the Massachusetts Medical Society (founded in 1781). ASA services statisticians, quantitative scientists, and users of statistics across many academic areas and applications. The association publishes a variety of journals and sponsors several international conferences every year.

==Mission==
The organization&#x27;s mission is to promote good application of statistical science, specifically to:
* support excellence in statistical practice, research, journals, and meetings
* work for the improvement of statistical education at all levels
* promote the proper application of statistics
* anticipate and meet member needs
* use the discipline of statistics to enhance human welfare
* seek opportunities to advance the statistics profession

==Membership==
As of 2022, the ASA membership exceeds 19,000 professionals found in government, academia, and the private sector.

=== Corporate supporters ===
Organizational members and corporate supporters of the ASA include AstraZeneca, Merck &amp; Co., the National Security Agency, Pfizer, RTI International, StataCorp and Westat.

=== Justice, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ===
In November 2018, ASA Board of Directors approved a code of conduct statement on Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI). It was reviewed and updated by ASA BOD in 2019, 2021, and most recently in 2023.

In June 2020, the R. A. Fisher Award and Lectureship was changed to COPSS Distinguished Achievement Award and Lectureship. The change follows discussions about Fisher&#x27;s views on race and eugenics.

In 2021, ASA established the Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Outreach Group, known as the JEDI Outreach Group.

==Fellowship==

New Fellowships of the ASA are granted annually by the ASA Committee on Fellows. Candidates must have been members for the preceding three years but may be nominated by anyone. The maximum number of recipients each year is one-third of one percent of the ASA membership.

==Organizational structure==
ASA is organized in Sections, Chapters and Committees. Chapters are arranged geographically, representing 78 areas across the US and Canada. An example of an early and large chapter is the SoCalASA. Sections are subject-area and industry-area interest groups covering 22 sub-disciplines. ASA has more than 60 committees coordinating meetings, publications, education, careers, and special-interest topics involving statisticians.

ASA is a member society of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences.

==Accredited Professional Statistician==
, the ASA offers the Accredited Professional Statistician status (PStat), to members who meet the ASA&#x27;s credentialing requirements, which include an advanced degree in statistics or related quantitative field, five years of documented experience, and evidence of professional competence. To apply for continuing accreditation, PStat members are expected to complete 60 hours of professional development activities each year.

The ASA also offers the Graduate Statistician status (GStat) as of April 2014. It serves as a preparatory accreditation suitable for graduate students.

A list of PStat and GStat accredited members is available on the ASA website.

<doc id="341989" wikidata="Q188029" url="?curid=341989" title="Phasmatodea">
<text>The Phasmatodea (also known as Phasmida or Phasmatoptera) are an order of insects whose members are variously known as stick insects, stick bugs, walkingsticks, stick animals, or bug sticks. They are also occasionally referred to as Devil&#x27;s darning needles, although this name is shared by both dragonflies and crane flies. They can be generally referred to as phasmatodeans, phasmids, or ghost insects, with phasmids in the family Phylliidae called leaf insects, leaf-bugs, walking leaves, or bug leaves. The group&#x27;s name is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;&quot;, meaning an apparition or phantom, referring to their resemblance to vegetation while in fact being animals. Their natural camouflage makes them difficult for predators to detect; still, many species have one of several secondary lines of defense in the form of startle displays, spines or toxic secretions. Stick insects from the genera &quot;Phryganistria&quot;, &quot;Ctenomorpha&quot;, and &quot;Phobaeticus&quot; include the world&#x27;s longest insects.

Members of the order are found on all continents except Antarctica, but they are most abundant in the tropics and subtropics. They are herbivorous, with many species living unobtrusively in the tree canopy. They have an incomplete metamorphosis life cycle with three stages: egg, nymph and adult. Many phasmids are parthenogenic, and do not require fertilized eggs for female offspring to be produced. In hotter climates, they may breed all year round; in more temperate regions, the females lay eggs in the autumn before dying, and the new generation hatches in the spring. Some species have wings and can disperse by flying, while others are more restricted.

==Description==

Phasmids vary greatly in size, with females typically growing larger than males of the same species. Males of the smallest species, such as &quot;Timema cristinae&quot;, reach about long, while females of the longest, an undescribed species informally known as &quot;Phryganistria &quot;chinensis&quot;&quot;, can be up to in total length, including outstretched legs. This makes it the world&#x27;s longest insect. The heaviest species of phasmid is likely to be &quot;Heteropteryx dilatata&quot;, the females of which may weigh as much as .

Some phasmids have cylindrical stick-like shapes, while others have flattened, leaflike shapes. Many species are wingless, or have reduced wings. The thorax is long in the winged species, since it houses the flight muscles, and is typically much shorter in the wingless forms. Where present, the first pair of wings is narrow and cornified (hardened), while the hind wings are broad, with straight veins along their length and multiple cross-veins. Their wing venation is unique among insects. The body is often further modified to resemble vegetation, with ridges resembling leaf veins, bark-like tubercles, and other forms of camouflage. A few species, such as &quot;Carausius morosus&quot;, are even able to change their pigmentation to match their surroundings. The mouthparts project out from the head. Chewing mandibles are uniform across species. The legs are typically long and slender, and some species are capable of limb autotomy (appendage shedding). Phasmids have long, slender antennae, as long as or longer than the rest of the body in some species.
All phasmids possess compound eyes, but ocelli (light-sensitive organs) are only known from the five groups Lanceocercata, Necrosciinae, Pseudophasmatidae, Palophidae and Phylliidae. Of these only the first three groups have females with ocelli, which like the wings seems to have re-evolved from ancestors that had lost them. Phasmids have an impressive visual system that allows them to perceive significant detail even in dim conditions, which suits their typically nocturnal lifestyle. They are born equipped with tiny compound eyes with a limited number of facets. As phasmids grow through successive molts, the number of facets in each eye is increased along with the number of photoreceptor cells. The sensitivity of the adult eye is at least tenfold that of the nymph in its first instar (developmental stage). As the eye grows more complex, the mechanisms to adapt to dark/light changes are also enhanced: eyes in dark conditions evidence fewer screening pigments, which would block light, than during the daytime, and changes in the width of the retinal layer to adapt to changes in available light are significantly more pronounced in adults. The larger size of the adult insects&#x27; eyes makes them more prone to radiation damage. This explains why fully grown individuals are mostly nocturnal. Lessened sensitivity to light in the newly emerged insects helps them to escape from the leaf litter wherein they are hatched and move upward into the more brightly illuminated foliage. Young stick insects are diurnal (daytime) feeders and move around freely, expanding their foraging range.

Stick insects have two types of pads on their legs: sticky &quot;toe pads&quot; and non-stick &quot;heel pads&quot; a little further up their legs. The heel pads are covered in microscopic hairs which create strong friction at low pressure, enabling them to grip without having to be peeled energetically from the surface at each step. The sticky toe pads are used to provide additional grip when climbing but are not used on a level surface.

==Distribution==

Phasmatodea can be found all over the world except for the Antarctic and Patagonia. They are most numerous in the tropics and subtropics. The greatest diversity is found in Southeast Asia and South America, followed by Australia, Central America, and the southern United States. Over 300 species are known from the island of Borneo, making it the richest place in the world for Phasmatodea.

==Anti-predator adaptations==

Phasmatodea species exhibit mechanisms for defense from predators that prevent an attack from happening in the first place (primary defense), and defenses that are deployed after an attack has been initiated (secondary defense).

The defense mechanism most readily identifiable with Phasmatodea is camouflage, in the form of a plant mimicry. Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as &quot;Pseudodiacantha macklotti&quot; and &quot;Bactrododema centaurum&quot;) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Remaining absolutely stationary enhances their inconspicuousness. Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift (&quot;Bostra scabrinota&quot;, &quot;Timema californica&quot;). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis, a number of species perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side; this is thought to mimic the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by entering a cataleptic state, where the insect adopts a rigid, motionless posture that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also help Phasmatodea to remain concealed from predators.


In a seemingly different method of defense, many species of Phasmatodea seek to startle the encroaching predator by flashing bright colors that are normally hidden, and making a loud noise. When disturbed on a branch or foliage, some species, while dropping to the undergrowth to escape, will open their wings momentarily during free fall to display bright colors that disappear when the insect lands. Others will maintain their display for up to 20 minutes, hoping to frighten the predator and convey the appearance of a larger size. Some, such as &quot;Pterinoxylus spinulosus&quot;, accompany the visual display with the noise made by rubbing together parts of the wings.

Some species, such as the young nymphs of &quot;Extatosoma tiaratum&quot;, have been observed to curl the abdomen upwards over the body and head to resemble ants or scorpions in an act of mimicry, another defense mechanism by which the insects avoid becoming prey. The eggs of some species such as &quot;Diapheromera femorata&quot; have fleshy projections resembling elaiosomes (fleshy structures sometimes attached to seeds) that attract ants. When the egg has been carried to the colony, the adult ant feeds the elaiosome to a larva while the phasmid egg is left to develop in the recesses of the nest in a protected environment.

When threatened, some phasmids that are equipped with femoral spines on the metathoracic legs (&quot;Oncotophasma martini&quot;, &quot;Eurycantha calcarata&quot;, &quot;Eurycantha horrida&quot;, &quot;Diapheromera veliei&quot;, &quot;Diapheromera covilleae,&quot; &quot;Heteropteryx dilatata&quot;) respond by curling the abdomen upward and repeatedly swinging the legs together, grasping at the threat. If the menace is caught, the spines can, in humans, draw blood and inflict considerable pain.

Some species are equipped with a pair of glands at the anterior (front) edge of the prothorax that enables the insect to release defensive secretions, including chemical compounds of varying effect: some produce distinct odors, and others can cause a stinging, burning sensation in the eyes and mouth of a predator. The spray often contains pungent-smelling volatile metabolites, previously thought to be concentrated in the insect from its plant food sources. However, it now seems more likely that the insect manufactures its own defensive chemicals. Additionally, the chemistry of the defense spray from at least one species, &quot;Anisomorpha buprestoides&quot;, has been shown to vary based on the insect&#x27;s life stage or the particular population it is part of. This chemical spray variation also corresponds with regionally specific color forms in populations in Florida, with the different variants having distinct behaviors. The spray from one species, &quot;Megacrania nigrosulfurea&quot;, is used as a treatment for skin infections by a tribe in Papua New Guinea because of its antibacterial constituents. Some species employ a shorter-range defensive secretion, where individuals bleed reflexively through the joints of their legs and the seams of the exoskeleton when bothered, allowing the blood (hemolymph), which contains distasteful compounds, to discourage predators. Another ploy is to regurgitate their stomach contents when harassed, repelling potential predators.

==Life cycle==

The life cycle of the stick insect begins when the female deposits her eggs through one of these methods of oviposition: she will either flick her egg to the ground by a movement of the ovipositor or her entire abdomen, carefully place the eggs in the axils of the host plant, bury them in small pits in the soil, or stick the eggs to a substrate, usually a stem or leaf of the food plant. A single female lays from 100 to 1,200 eggs after mating, depending on the species.

Many species of phasmids are parthenogenic, meaning the females lay eggs without needing to mate with males to produce offspring. Eggs from virgin mothers are entirely female and hatch into nymphs that are exact copies of their mothers. Stick insect species that are the product of hybridisation are usually obligate parthenogens, but non-hybrids are facultative parthenogens, meaning they retain the ability to mate and their sexual behavior depends on the presence and abundance of males.

Phasmatodea eggs resemble seeds in shape and size and have hard shells. They have a lid-like structure called an operculum at the anterior pole, from which the nymph emerges during hatching. The eggs vary in the length of time before they hatch which varies from 13 to more than 70 days, with the average around 20 to 30 days. Some species, particularly those from temperate regions, undergo diapause, where development is delayed during the winter months. Diapause is initiated by the effect of short day lengths on the egg-laying adults or can be genetically determined. Diapause is broken by exposure to the cold of winter, causing the eggs to hatch during the following spring. Among species of economic importance such as &quot;Diapheromera femorata&quot;, diapause results in the development of two-year cycles of outbreaks.

Many species&#x27; eggs bear a fatty, knoblike capitulum that caps the operculum. This structure attracts ants because of its resemblance to the elaiosome of some plant seeds that are sought-after food sources for ant larvae, and usually contribute to ensuring seed dispersal by ants, a form of ant-plant mutualism called myrmecochory. The ants take the egg into their nest underground and can remove the capitulum to feed to their larvae without harming the phasmid embryo. There, the egg hatches and the young nymph, which initially resembles an ant (another instance of mimicry among Phasmatodea), eventually emerges from the nest and climbs the nearest tree to safety in the foliage. The eggs of stick insects have a coating of calcium oxalate which makes them survive unscathed in the digestive tract of birds. It has been suggested that birds may have a role in the dispersal of parthenogenetic stick insect species, especially to islands.

The Phasmatodea life cycle is hemimetabolous, proceeding through a series of several nymphal instars. Once emerged, a nymph will eat its cast skin. Adulthood is reached for most species after several months and many molts. The lifespan of Phasmatodea varies by species, but ranges from a few months to up to three years.

==Ecology==
Phasmids are herbivorous, feeding mostly on the leaves of trees and shrubs, and a conspicuous component of many Neotropical systems. Phasmatodea has been postulated as dominant light-gap herbivores there. Their role in the forest ecosystem is considered important by many scientists, who stress the significance of light gaps in maintaining succession and resilience in climax forests. The presence of phasmids lowers the net production of early successional plants by consuming them and then enriches the soil by defecation. This enables the late succession plants to become established and encourages the recycling of the tropical forest.

Phasmatodea are recognized as injurious to forest and shade trees by defoliation. &quot;Didymuria violescens&quot;, &quot;Podacanthus wilkinsoni&quot; and &quot;Ctenomorphodes tessulatus&quot; in Australia, &quot;Diapheromera femorata&quot; in North America and &quot;Graeffea crouani&quot; in coconut plantations in the South Pacific all occur in outbreaks of economic importance. Indeed, in the American South, as well as in Michigan and Wisconsin, the walking stick is a significant problem in parks and recreation sites, where it consumes the foliage of oaks and other hardwoods. Severe outbreaks of the walking stick, &quot;Diapheromera femorata&quot;, have occurred in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma. The insects eat the entire leaf blade. In the event of heavy outbreaks, entire stands of trees can be completely denuded. Continuous defoliation over several years often results in the death of the tree. Because these species cannot fly, infestations are typically contained to a radius of a few hundred yards. Nevertheless, the damage incurred to parks in the region is often costly. Control efforts in the case of infestations have typically involved chemical pesticides; ground fires are effective at killing eggs but have obvious disadvantages. In New South Wales, research has investigated the feasibility of controlling stick insects using natural enemies such as parasitic wasps (&quot;Myrmecomimesis&quot; spp.).

==Taxonomy==

The classification of the Phasmatodea is complex and the relationships between its members are poorly understood. Furthermore, there is much confusion over the ordinal name. Phasmida is preferred by many authors, though it is incorrectly formed; Phasmatodea is correctly formed, and is widely accepted. However, Brock and Marshall argue:

The order Phasmatodea is sometimes considered to be related to other orders, including the Blattodea, Mantodea, Grylloblattodea, Mantophasmatodea and Dermaptera, but the affiliations are uncertain and the grouping (sometimes referred to as &quot;Orthopteroidea&quot;) may be paraphyletic (not have a common ancestor) and hence invalid in the traditional circumscription (set of attributes that all members have). Phasmatodea, once considered a suborder of Orthoptera, is now treated as an order of its own. Anatomical features separate them as a monophyletic (descended from a common ancestor) group from the Orthoptera. One is the instance among all species of Phasmatodea of a pair of exocrine glands inside the prothorax used for defense. Another is the presence of a specially formed sclerite (hardened plate), called a vomer, which allows the male to clasp the female during mating.

The order is divided into two, or sometimes three, suborders. The traditional division is into the suborder groups Anareolatae and Areolatae, which are distinguished according to whether the insect has sunken areola, or circular areas, on the underside of the apices of the middle and hind tibiae (Areolate) or not (Anareolate). However the phylogenetic (evolutionary) relationships between the different groups is poorly resolved. The monophyly of Anareolatae has been questioned and the morphology of the eggs may be a better basis for classification. An alternative is to divide the Phasmatodea into three suborders Agathemerodea (1 genus and 8 species), Timematodea (1 genus and 21 species) and Euphasmatodea (or Verophasmatodea) for the remaining taxa. This division is, however, not fully supported by the molecular studies, which recover Agathemerodea as nested within Euphasmatodea rather than being the sister group of the latter group. Recent taxonomic treatments recognise two suborders, with Agathemeridae placed in Pseudophasmatoidea within Euphasmatodea and Agathemerodea treated as &quot;nomen dubium&quot;

While suggestions have been made that various insects extending back to the Permian epoch represent stem-group phasmatodeans, the earliest unambiguous members of the group are the Susumanioidea, which first appeared during the Middle Jurassic, and usually have two large pairs of wings. Modern phasmatodeans first appeared during the Early Cretaceous, with the currently oldest known being &quot;Araripephasma&quot; from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) Crato Formation of Brazil, around 113 million years old, which can be confidently assigned to the Euphasmatodea.

The earliest leaf insect (Phylliinae) fossil is &quot;Eophyllium messelensis&quot; from the 47-million-year-old Eocene of Messel, Germany. In size and cryptic (leaflike) body form, it closely resembles extant species, suggesting that the behavior of the group has changed little since that time.

Over 3,500 species have been described, with many more yet to be described both in museum collections and in the wild.

==Select species==

One Australian species, the Lord Howe Island stick insect, is now listed as critically endangered. It was believed extinct until its rediscovery on the rock known as Ball&#x27;s Pyramid. An effort is underway in Australia to rear this species in captivity.

The best known of the stick insects is the Indian or laboratory stick insect (&quot;Carausius morosus&quot;). This insect grows to roughly 10 cm (4 in) and reproduces parthenogenically, and although males have been recorded, they are rare.

Fossils of the extinct genus and species &quot;Eoprephasma hichensi&quot; have been recovered from Ypresian age sediments in the U.S. state of Washington and British Columbia, Canada. The species is one of the youngest members of the stem phasmatodean group Susumanioidea.

=== European species ===
In Europe there are 17 species of stick insects described, belonging to the genera &quot;Bacillus&quot; &quot;Clonopsis&quot;, &quot;Leptynia&quot; and &quot;Pijnackeria&quot;. There are also a few other species that live in Europe but are introduced, as for example with a couple of species of &quot;Acanthoxyla&quot;, which are native to New Zealand but are present in southern England.

In the Iberian Peninsula there are currently described 13 species and several subspecies. Their life cycle is annual, living only during the hottest months (especially genera &quot;Leptynia&quot; and &quot;Pijnackeria&quot;), which usually means late spring to early autumn.

==Behavior==

Stick insects, like praying mantises, show rocking behavior in which the insect makes rhythmic, repetitive, side-to-side movements. The common interpretation of this behavior&#x27;s function is it enhances crypsis by mimicking vegetation moving in the wind. These movements may also be important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from the background by relative motion. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion to help them discern objects in the foreground.

Mating behavior in Phasmatodea is impressive because of the extraordinarily long duration of some pairings. A record among insects, the stick insect &quot;Necroscia sparaxes&quot;, found in India, is sometimes coupled for 79 days at a time. It is not uncommon for this species to assume the mating posture for days or weeks on end, and among some species (&quot;Diapheromera veliei&quot; and &quot;D. covilleae&quot;), pairing can last three to 136 hours in captivity.

Overt displays of aggression between males over mates suggests that extended pairing may have evolved to guard females from sperm competition. Fighting between competing males has been observed in the species &quot;D. veiliei&quot; and &quot;D. covilleae&quot;. During these encounters, the approach of a challenger causes the existing mate to manipulate the female&#x27;s abdomen, which he has clasped by means of the clasping organ, or vomer, down upon itself to block the site of attachment. Occasionally, the consort will strike out at the competitor with the mid femora, which are equipped with an enlarged and hooked spine in both sexes that can draw the blood of the opponent when they are flexed against the body to puncture the integument. Usually, a strong hold on the female&#x27;s abdomen and blows to the intruder are enough to deter the unwanted competition, but occasionally the competitor has been observed to employ a sneaky tactic to inseminate the female. While the first mate is engaged in feeding and is forced to vacate the dorsal position, the intruder can clasp the female&#x27;s abdomen and insert his genitalia. If he is discovered, the males will enter into combat wherein they lean backward, both clasped to the female&#x27;s abdomen, and freely suspended, engage in rapid, sweeping blows with their forelegs in a manner similar to boxing. Usually, when the intruder gains attachment to the female&#x27;s abdomen, these conflicts result in the displacement of the original mate.

Lengthy pairings have also been described in terms of a defensive alliance. When cleaved together, the pair is more unwieldy for predators to handle. Also, the chemical defenses (secretions, reflex bleeding, regurgitation) of the individual stick insect are enhanced when two are paired. Females survive attacks by predators significantly better when pairing, largely because the dorsal position of the male functions well as a shield. This could indicate that manipulation by females is taking place: if females accept ejaculate at a slow rate, for instance, the males are forced to remain &quot;in copulo&quot; for longer and the female&#x27;s chances of survival are enhanced. Also, evolution could have simply favored males that remained attached to their females longer, since females are often less abundant than males and represent a valuable prize, so for the lucky male, even the sacrifice of his own life to preserve his offspring with the female may be worthwhile. Sexual dimorphism in the species, where females are usually significantly larger than the males, may have evolved due to the fitness advantage accrued to males that can remain attached to the female, thereby blocking competitors, without severely impeding her movement.

Certain Phasmatodea, such as &quot;Anisomorpha buprestoides&quot;, sometimes form aggregations. These insects have been observed to congregate during the day in a concealed location, going their separate ways at nightfall to forage, and returning to their refuge before dawn. Such behavior has been little studied, and how the insects find their way back is unknown.

==In human culture==

Stick insects are often kept in captivity: almost 300 species have been reared in laboratories or as pets. The most commonly kept is the Indian (or laboratory) stick insect, &quot;Carausius morosus&quot;, which eats vegetables such as lettuce. Droppings of the stick insect &quot;Eurycnema versirubra&quot; (Serville, 1838) [=&quot;Eurycnema versifasciata&quot;] fed with specific plants are made into a medicinal tea by Malaysian Chinese to treat ailments.

The botanical illustrator Marianne North (1830–1890) painted leaf and stick insects that she saw on her travels in the 1870s.

Tribesmen in Sarawak eat phasmids and their eggs.

Some indigenous people of the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Islands have traditionally made fishhooks from the legs of certain phasmids.
Research has been conducted to analyze the stick insect method of walking and apply this to the engineering of six-legged walking robots. Instead of one centralized control system, it seems each leg of a phasmid operates independently.

In Australia and Hawaii many kinds of stick insects are kept as exotic pets including the strong, goliath, spiny and children&#x27;s. The custom of keeping stick insects as pets was probably brought to Australia by either Chinese, Japanese or Vietnamese immigrants during World War II, the Korean War or the Vietnam War.

Stick insects have been kept as pets since the time of the Han dynasty. They were kept inside birdcages and people in the Far East believe they bring good luck and fortune, just like crickets.

The video game &quot;Disco Elysium&quot; includes a storyline centered around a giant stick insect and cryptid called the insulindian phasmid.

A clip of a stick insect swaying back and forth, in a manner akin to dancing, became an Internet meme in 2020 as a bait-and-switch.

<doc id="341990" wikidata="Q624611" url="?curid=341990" title="One Life to Live">
<text>One Life to Live (often abbreviated as OLTL) is an American soap opera broadcast on the ABC television network for more than 43 years, from July 15, 1968, to January 13, 2012, and then on the internet as a web series on Hulu and iTunes via Prospect Park from April 29 to August 19, 2013. Created by Agnes Nixon, the series was the first daytime drama to primarily feature ethnically and socioeconomically diverse characters and consistently emphasize social issues. &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was expanded from 30 minutes to 45 minutes on July 26, 1976, and then to an hour on January 16, 1978.

&quot;One Life to Live&quot; heavily focuses on the members and relationships of the Lord family. Actress Erika Slezak began portraying the series&#x27; protagonist Victoria Lord in March 1971 and played the character continuously for the rest of the show&#x27;s run on ABC Daytime, winning a record six Daytime Emmy Awards for the role. In 2002, the series won an Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series. 

On September 17, 2010, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; became the last American daytime soap opera taped in New York City; it earned this distinction after &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, which had been taped in New York since its 1956 premiere, aired its final episode. No daytime serial has emanated from New York since; ABC&#x27;s lone soap, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, CBS&#x27; &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, and Peacock&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; are all recorded in California and CBS&#x27; other serial, &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot;, is produced outside of Atlanta. 

On April 14, 2011, ABC announced that it was canceling &quot;One Life to Live&quot; after nearly 43 years on the air due to low ratings. On July 7, 2011, production company Prospect Park announced that it would continue the show as a web series after its run on ABC, but later suspended the project. The show taped its final scenes for ABC on November 18, 2011, and its final episode on the network aired on January 13, 2012, with a cliffhanger. On January 16, 2012, the following Monday, ABC replaced &quot;One Life to Live&quot; with a new and short-lived talk show called &quot;The Revolution&quot; that aired until July 6 of the same year.

On January 7, 2013, Prospect Park resumed its plan to continue &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as a daily 30-minute web series on Hulu and iTunes via The Online Network. The relaunched series premiered on April 29, 2013. The new series was plagued with several behind-the-scenes problems, most notably a litigation between Prospect Park and ABC regarding the misuse of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; characters on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. On September 3, 2013, Prospect Park suspended production of the series until the lawsuit with ABC was resolved.

==Creation==
Impressed with the ratings success of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Another World&quot;, ABC sought out &quot;Another World&quot; writer Nixon to create a serial for them. Though Nixon&#x27;s concept for the new series was &quot;built along the classic soap formula of a rich family and a poor family,&quot; she was &quot;tired of the restraints imposed by the WASPy, noncontroversial nature of daytime drama.&quot; &quot;One Life to Live&quot; would emphasize &quot;the ethnic and socioeconomic diversity&quot; of the characters in its fictional setting. Nixon would go on to create &quot;All My Children&quot; in 1970 and &quot;Loving&quot; in 1983.

The initial main titles of the series featured the image of a roaring fireplace, a visual representation of the originally proposed title — &quot;Between Heaven and Hell&quot; — ultimately changed to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; to avoid controversy. &quot;One Life to Live&quot; first sponsor was the Colgate-Palmolive company, who also sponsored &quot;The Doctors&quot;. ABC bought the show from Nixon in December 1974 when they purchased all stock to her Creative Horizons, Inc. The show was originally a half-hour serial until it was expanded to 45 minutes on July 23, 1976, and to one hour on January 16, 1978.

==Series history==
&quot;One Life to Live&quot; is set in the fictional city of Llanview, a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The show continually centers on the wealthy, White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Lord family, with the working-class Polish American Wolek family, the less wealthy Irish Catholic Riley family, and the first regular African-American characters in U.S. soap operas, working-class mother and daughter Sadie Gray and Carla Gray, are present at the series&#x27; inception. &quot;One Life to Live&quot; has been called &quot;the most peculiarly American of soap operas: the first serial to present a vast array of ethnic types, broad comic situations, a constant emphasis on social issues, and strong male characters.&quot;

From the debut episode, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; centered on fictional character Victoria &quot;Viki&quot; Lord (originated by Gillian Spencer), portrayed by six-time Daytime Emmy Award winner Erika Slezak for longer than any other &quot;One Life to Live&quot; series actor, from March 1971 through the series finale January 13, 2012, as well as the 2013 web revival. Long-suffering heroine Viki weathered love and loss, widowhood, rape, divorce, stroke, and breast cancer, and was plagued by dissociative identity disorder (or DID, once known as multiple personality disorder) on and off for decades. Viki also had heart problems and received a transplant from her dying husband Ben Davidson (Mark Derwin). Featured male protagonist Dr. Larry Wolek also appeared at the debut episode and for 36 years, played from 1969 until the character&#x27;s last appearance in 2004 by Emmy-nominated actor Michael Storm.

The apparent murder of Marco Dane (Gerald Anthony) by Victoria Lord in 1979 and the ensuing prostitution storyline of Larry Wolek&#x27;s wife, Karen Wolek (Judith Light), garnered widespread critical acclaim and several Daytime Emmy Awards. The 1980s brought great ratings success with the introduction of the Buchanan family and the rise to prominence of Viki&#x27;s scheming sister, Tina Lord (notably played by Andrea Evans). In the 1990s, the show introduced one of the first married interracial couples in soap operas with attorneys Hank and Nora Gannon (Nathan Purdee and Hillary B. Smith respectively), and the story of the involvement of Viki&#x27;s estranged brother, Todd (Roger Howarth), with the rape of Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell), was called &quot;one of the show&#x27;s most remembered and impactful.&quot;

&quot;One Life to Live&quot; celebrated its 40th anniversary in July 2008 with the return of several former cast members and by revisiting notable plot lines from its past. &quot;Deceased&quot; characters and even creator Agnes Nixon appeared in a storyline in which Slezak&#x27;s Viki dies and visits Heaven, an homage to Viki&#x27;s 1987 heavenly trip. Daytime Emmy Award-nominee Andrea Evans and others returned for a tribute to Tina Lord&#x27;s famous 1987 plunge over the Iguazu Falls and the 1990 royal wedding in fictional Mendorra. And like the 1988 Old West storyline in which the character Clint Buchanan steps back 100 years in the past, on July 21, 2008, Robert S. Woods began an extended storyline in which his character Bo Buchanan finds himself transplanted back into his own past—specifically 1968, the year of the series&#x27; inception—witnessing the Buchanan family&#x27;s backstory unfold. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; subsequently named &quot;One Life to Live&quot; their &quot;Best Show&quot; of 2008, calling it &quot;the year&#x27;s most compelling&quot; series and citing a myriad of story lines the magazine found &quot;heartbreaking,&quot; &quot;stunning,&quot; and &quot;gripping,&quot; as well as complimenting its risk-taking and &quot;diverse and talented&quot; cast.

On August 4, 2009, it was announced that &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, which was taped in New York City, would move from ABC Studio 17 at 56 West 66th Street to Studio 23 at 320 West 66th Street, Manhattan in early 2010. This studio was made available by the move of sister serial &quot;All My Children&quot; to a production facility in Los Angeles, where that series began taping on January 4, 2010. The new studio was 30% larger than &quot;One Life to Live&quot; previous one, and both &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot; were to be taped and broadcast in high-definition television (HD) after their moves.

On October 8, 2009, ABC announced that it had postponed the transition to HD for &quot;One Live to Live&quot;, citing the economic climate at the time, though an ABC spokesperson stated that they &quot;...will re-examine it next year.&quot; On December 6, 2010, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; became the fifth daytime serial to broadcast in the 16:9 aspect ratio widescreen picture format but still not in true HD, after &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, and fellow ABC soap operas &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;, though those series are produced in high-definition. ABC&#x27;s picture disclaimers at the start of the program list it as being aired in &quot;digital widescreen&quot; rather than HD. The September 17, 2010, series ending of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; left &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as the last remaining American daytime serial being produced in the New York metropolitan area as well as the only one produced outside the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

===Cancellation===
Rumors about a potential cancellation of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; arose from &quot;TV Guide Canada&quot; in late 2009, after ABC announced that it was moving &quot;All My Children&quot; from New York City to Los Angeles. &quot;One Life to Live&quot;&#x27;s lone presence in New York among the ABC soap operas, along its non-transition to HD and its struggling ratings, made it a program at risk of cancellation. The article from &quot;TV Guide Canada&quot; also pointed that once &quot;One Life to Live&quot; is cancelled, some of the actors could be offered to join the cast of &quot;All My Children&quot; in Los Angeles. In May 2010, rumors of possible cancellation of not only &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, but this time of also &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;, resurfaced when Walt Disney Television officially announced that it was shutting down Soapnet, effective in 2012. After a failed attempt to give Aisha Tyler a talk show in 2009, ABC restarted auditioning a few pilot shows as candidates for its daytime lineup. At this point, &quot;All My Children&quot; had the lowest ratings so rumors began heating up in March 2011 about the show&#x27;s demise, with hints that &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was safe for a while longer. However, early in April 2011, rumors suggested that both &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; were in danger of cancellation.

After months of cancellation rumors, ABC announced on April 14, 2011 that &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; would end their runs. ABC cited &quot;extensive research into what today&#x27;s daytime viewers want and the changing viewing patterns of the audience.&quot; The network stated it was replacing &quot;One Life to Live&quot; with a new production entitled &quot;The Revolution&quot;, which would focus on health and lifestyles. While the cancellations of both soap operas were announced on the same day, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was to remain on the air four months longer because its replacement would not be ready until later. In response to the cancellations, vacuum cleaner manufacturer The Hoover Company withdrew its advertising from all ABC programs out of protest.

The final episode aired on January 13, 2012, with villainess Allison Perkins (Barbara Garrick) narrating her views about the people of Llanview. During the last minutes of the episode, Todd Manning (Howarth) is put under arrest for the murder of twin brother Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John). The show ends with the discovery that Victor Lord, Jr. is still alive and has been kidnapped by Perkins. Perkins closes the 43-year-old soap opera by breaking the fourth wall by throwing a &quot;One Life to Live&quot; script at Victor saying to him: &quot;But why spoil what happens next. You of all people should know things are rarely what they appear&quot;. The decision to conclude &quot;One Life to Live&quot; with an open-ended story is because the serial was supposed to continue on another network at the time the last scenes were taped (see section below).

On the day of the final episode, &quot;The View&quot; hosted a tribute to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; where several actors were invited including Erika Slezak, Robert S. Woods, Robin Strasser, Hillary B. Smith, Kassie DePaiva, James DePaiva, Andrea Evans, Judith Light and the show&#x27;s creator Agnes Nixon.

The departure of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; ended a 62-year history of daytime television soap operas taped in New York which started in 1950 with the CBS&#x27;s daytime drama &quot;The First Hundred Years&quot;.

===Cast and characters===


The show originally concentrated on the wealthy, White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Lord family, the less wealthy Siegels (among the first attempts to showcase either an interfaith marriage or Jewish character on daytime television), the middle-class Riley family and Wolek family, and the working-class African American mother and daughter Sadie Gray and Carla Gray. Heiress Victoria Lord and her extended family remained a prime focus until the series ended. Over the years many other families were introduced, most notably the Buchanan family and the Cramer family, who intermarried with the Lords and also remained a fixture on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; until its end.

Several actors performed on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; for 20 years or more, including Erika Slezak, Michael Storm, Robert S. Woods, Philip Carey, and Robin Strasser. Actors who became famous for their work on the show and who went on to greater fame with their prime time, feature film or theatre work include Lillian Hayman, Ellen Holly, Tommy Lee Jones, Al Freeman Jr., Laurence Fishburne, Judith Light, Phylicia Rashad, Blair Underwood, Marcia Cross, Roma Downey, Mario Van Peebles, Jessica Tuck, Ryan Phillippe, Hayden Panettiere, Nathan Fillion, Renée Elise Goldsberry, and Tika Sumpter.

===Controversies===
In 2002, the popularity of antihero Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) prompted ABC to market a rag doll of the character, complete with his signature scar. First offered for sale on April 29, 2002, the doll was pulled on May 7, 2002, after a backlash begun when &quot;The Jack Myers Report&quot; &quot;harshly criticized the network&#x27;s judgment&quot; on creating and releasing a doll based on Manning, a character who had notably been convicted of rape in 1993. &quot;The New York Times&quot; later quoted then-ABC President Angela Shapiro stating, &quot;I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive to the history of the character and I wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

Shortly after receiving a March 2005 GLAAD Media Award for its coverage of LGBT issues, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was met with criticism when married district attorney Daniel Colson (Mark Dobies) was revealed to have murdered two people to cover up the fact that he was secretly gay. GLAAD itself criticized the storyline &quot;for reinforcing the idea that being gay is something to be ashamed of,&quot; while &quot;TV Guide&quot; noted &quot;It&#x27;s hard to disagree with those who say that&#x27;s a lousy representation of gay folks.&quot; Executive Producer Frank Valentini defended the story, saying, &quot;This is a story about the harsher side of intolerance and about one man not being true to himself. There are going to be meaningful, frank discussions that come out of this.&quot; Then-head writer Dena Higley explained, &quot;The number one rule of soap opera is never cut drama. Daniel being gay and keeping that a secret is a dramatic story.&quot;

In June 2009, actress Patricia Mauceri (a performer on the series since 1995) was replaced in her role as Latin matriarch Carlotta Vega, reportedly after voicing personal religious objections to a planned storyline in which Carlotta would be supportive of a gay relationship.

==Prospect Park==

===Unsuccessful revival attempt===
On July 7, 2011, ABC announced that it had licensed the rights to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot; to television, film and music production company Prospect Park, allowing both series to continue producing new first-run episodes beyond the conclusion of their television runs on ABC, with the series moving to a new Hulu-style online channel currently in development by Prospect Park; as a result of the company&#x27;s acquisition of the two soap operas, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot;, would become the first soap operas to transition their first-run broadcasts from traditional television to internet television.

On September 16, 2011, executive producer Frank Valentini was retained by Prospect Park for that serial as well as &quot;All My Children&quot; when both shows would move to The Online Network. On September 28, 2011, Prospect Park confirmed that &quot;One Life to Live&quot; would start on its The Online Network internet channel in January 2012, but without specifying the exact date. On September 30, 2011, it was announced that head writer Ron Carlivati would be also heading to the internet version of the show.

Since the agreement made between ABC and Prospect Park was not limited to internet television and did allow for &quot;One Life to Live&quot; to be broadcast on traditional television, there was an announcement on August 3, 2011, about a possibility of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; airing on a cable television. On October 5, 2011, the project to bring &quot;One Life to Live&quot; to cable was reiterated in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, where it was revealed that Prospect Park planned to first air episodes on The Online Network, then make them available on video on demand and, then weeks later, on cable television.

On November 23, 2011, Prospect Park officially suspended its plans to continue the show after its run on ABC.
Reasons given by Prospect Park included funding problems and poor negotiations with the unions representing the cast of &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Writers Guild of America and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which respectively represent the writer and the actors, have expressed disappointment over Prospect Park&#x27;s decision. Though not one of the reasons given by Prospect Park, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; suggested that the company&#x27;s lack of success in finding a cable network to carry the show may have been instrumental in the company&#x27;s decision to not pursue the project.

Despite its fruitless attempt to save the series, Prospect Park had succeeded in retaining 13 actors to sign for the online venture, compared to only two actors for &quot;All My Children&quot;. Matriarch actress Erika Slezak (Victoria Lord) was among the 13. The 12 other actors were Melissa Archer (Nathalie Buchanan), Kassie DePaiva (Blair Cramer), Michael Easton (John McBain), Shenell Edmonds (Destiny Evans), Josh Kelly (Cutter Wentworth), Ted King (Tomás Delgado), Florencia Lozano (Tea Delgado), Kelley Missal (Danielle Manning), Sean Ringgold (Shaun Evans), Andrew Trischitta (Jack Manning), Jerry verDorn (Clint Buchanan) and Tuc Watkins (David Vickers).

===2013 revival===

On January 7, 2013, Prospect Park made an official statement about its plans to restart production of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot; as web series. The two soap operas will serve as anchor shows for The Online Network (Prospect Park&#x27;s new streaming television that was supposed to be launched during the original attempt in 2011). Prospect Park inked deals with SAG-AFTRA and DGA. Prospect
Park confirmed that former coordinating producer, Jennifer Pepperman had signed on as the new executive producer for the web reboot of &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Creator Agnes Nixon would work as consultant for the new web series. On January 13, 2013, it was confirmed that soap opera writers Thom Racina and Susan Bedsow Horgan were named as the new Head Writers of &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. On April 9, 2013, it was reported that Horgan citing &quot;personal reasons&quot; had stepped down as co-HW, leaving Racina as &quot;OLTL&quot;″s sole HW.

On January 22, 2013, Prospect Park released a full cast of the reboot of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; who signed on, which include Melissa Archer (Natalie Buchanan), Kassie DePaiva (Blair Cramer), Josh Kelly (Cutter Wentworth), Florencia Lozano (Tea Delgado), Kelley Missal (Danielle Manning), Erika Slezak (Victoria Lord), Hillary B. Smith (Nora Buchanan), Robin Strasser (Dorian Lord), Andrew Trischitta (Jack Manning), Jerry verDorn (Clint Buchanan), Tuc Watkins (David Vickers) and Robert S. Woods (Bo Buchanan). Recurring actors who have signed on are Sean Ringgold (Shaun Evans), Shenaz Treasury (Rama Patel), and Nick Choksi (Vimal Patel).

Production of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; began on February 25, 2013 with taping of new episodes beginning on March 18, 2013. The series premiered on April 29, 2013, at 12PM Eastern The revived &quot;One Life to Live&quot; is a 30-minute program taped in Stamford, Connecticut. It is available on Hulu and Hulu Plus as well as various iTunes applications including iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

On May 17, 2013, The Online Network announced that &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life To Live&quot; woould no longer air five days a week together, due to viewer ratings that have been seen as certain patterns that resemble more closely the typical patterns of online viewing rather than how one would watch traditional television. Starting May 20, 2013 &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Life&quot; would be presented in a new schedule, with &quot;All My Children&quot; airing on Mondays and Wednesdays and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; airing Tuesdays and Thursdays. The recap shows &quot;MORE All My Children&quot; and &quot;MORE One Life To Life&quot; would also combine together as one show airing on Fridays. The following day on May 18, 2013, both shows were noticeably missing from the FX Canada website and schedule, and subsequently were available on iTunes Canada; it was later revealed that FX Canada dropped &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; due to the reduction of episodes, the carriage agreement called for four episodes a week of both shows. With the reduction, FX Canada has said &quot;the agreement is no longer valid.&quot; On May 20, 2013, the first episodes of the new &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life To Live&quot; were available worldwide on The Online Network&#x27;s YouTube page, &quot;TOLNSoaps&quot;.

On May 24, 2013, in a press release Prospect Park announced through Agnes Nixon that Racina would be replaced as head writer of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; by the then-current screenwriters Jessica Klein and Marin Gazzaniga.

On June 5, 2013, due to a labor dispute with the I.A.T.S.E. &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; were forced into an early hiatus with the writers, directors and editors still working; there were talks of production being moved out of state, but those plans were later shelved. On June 20, 2013, a deal was reached between Prospect Park and the Union and taping resumed on August 12, 2013. On June 25, 2013, TOLN announced that there would be a scheduling switch for &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot;. Starting on July 1 (Monday) all episodes of the week, for both shows, would be released on Mondays.

Beginning July 15, 2013, &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; aired for a 10-week limited engagement on the Oprah Winfrey Network Monday through Thursday at 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM.

&quot;One Life to Live&quot; first-season finale aired on August 19, 2013.

On September 3, 2013, a report from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that &quot;One Life to Live&#x27;s&quot; second season was to be put on hold while Prospect Park dealt with its lawsuit against ABC over &quot;General Hospital&#x27;s&quot; treatment of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; characters loaned to the series when they crossed over in 2012. In December 2016 the lawsuit was dismissed, with the rights to the series reverting to ABC.

==Transition to &quot;General Hospital&quot;==
On December 1, 2011, two weeks after &quot;One Life to Live&quot; finished taping its final scenes, ABC confirmed that former executive producer Frank Valentini and head writer Ron Carlivati would assume the same roles on &quot;General Hospital&quot; effective January 9, 2012.

Several former &quot;One Life to Live&quot; actors - Kassie DePaiva, Roger Howarth, Michael Easton, and Kristen Alderson - moved with Valentini and Carlivati and reprised their characters on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. With the exception of DePaiva, all of these actors were eventually put on contract and stayed permanently with the show. On May 9, 2012, Florencia Lozano joined the cast, reprising her &quot;One Life to Live&quot; role of Téa Delgado in a recurring capacity.

On April 18, 2013, after Prospect Park had announced they would be reviving the series, Prospect Park filed a lawsuit against ABC, alleging ABC failed to honor its part of their licensing agreement. Among the issues named in the lawsuits included ABC&#x27;s alleged attempts to sabotage Prospect Park&#x27;s revival of the soap by killing off &quot;One Life to Live&quot; characters loaned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; (Cole and Hope Thornhart), failure on ABC&#x27;s part to consult Prospect Park on storylines involving &quot;One Life to Live&quot; characters (breaking up popular &quot;One Life to Live&quot; couple John and Natalie to pair Michael Easton&#x27;s John McBain with former &quot;Port Charles&quot; love interest, Kelly Monaco&#x27;s Sam Morgan, the death of Tea Delgado&#x27;s baby and the subsequent switching of her baby with Sam Morgan&#x27;s live baby, orchestrated by Howarth&#x27;s Todd Manning), as well as claiming one &quot;One Life to Live&quot; character Tomas Delgado was actually &quot;General Hospital&quot; character, Lorenzo Alcazar. Effective immediately, the three &quot;One Life to Live&quot; characters bound to contracts with ABC were to exit the show, and the three actors who played them, Kristen Alderson, Michael Easton and Roger Howarth were rewritten back onto the &quot;General Hospital&quot; canvas playing new characters, while Howarth also crossed his character of Todd back over to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; for its inaugural season.

On September 3, 2013, Prospect Park announced that production of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; would be on hold until their litigation with ABC was settled.

==Crossovers==
Throughout the show&#x27;s history, the plot lines of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; have been established as existing in the same fictional universe as other ABC-owned daytime series, in particular Agnes Nixon&#x27;s &quot;All My Children&quot;, which premiered in 1970. As noted from time to time in both series, fictional Pine Valley—the setting of &quot;All My Children&quot;—is located in Pennsylvania near &quot;One Life to Live&quot; Llanview. Over the years, many characters have crossover from one series to another in both short appearances and extended runs. As early as 1968, &quot;General Hospital&quot; Dr. Steve Hardy appeared in Llanview to consult on Meredith Lord&#x27;s blood disease as a means to lead &quot;General Hospital&quot; viewers to the new series; similarly, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; Dr. Larry Wolek visited &quot;All My Children&quot; shortly after its premiere in 1970.

In 1979, when Viki Riley was on trial for the murder of Marco Dane, she was defended by Pine Valley attorney Paul Martin. Two characters that also appeared on &quot;All My Children&quot; are Sadie Gray (Lillian Hayman), when she sang for the wedding of Dr. Frank and Caroline Grant, and Delilah Ralston (Shelly Burch), when she designed a special dress to be worn by Erica Kane (Susan Lucci).

In 1999, Daytime Emmy Award-winner Linda Dano returned to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as Rae Cummings, a character she had previously played on the series from 1978 to 1980. In a 2000 move of network synergy designed to &quot;entice viewers to tune into soap operas that they might not have usually watched,&quot; then-President of ABC Daytime Angela Shapiro orchestrated Dano&#x27;s concurrent appearance as
Gretel on the three other ABC daytime dramas at the time — &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and &quot;Port Charles&quot; — in an extended crossover storyline which was the first time a daytime character had ever appeared on four series. Gretel&#x27;s search for the child she had given up for adoption takes her to &quot;All My Children&quot;, where she discovers in 2000 that her own birth mother is Pine Valley&#x27;s Myrtle Fargate. Following clues to &quot;Port Charles&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Gretel finally finds her daughter back in Llanview on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;: Skye Chandler, herself a former &quot;All My Children&quot; character who had relocated to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1999. Skye&#x27;s adopted &quot;All My Children&quot; father Adam Chandler appears on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 2001, and Gretel initially identifies Skye&#x27;s biological father as Alan Quartermaine of &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Both women subsequently appear on that series, with Skye moving to &quot;General Hospital&quot; full-time in 2001 and Gretel returning to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; until 2004, making some appearances on &quot;General Hospital&quot; later in 2002 and 2003.

A December 30, 2003, visit by &quot;One Life to Live&quot; Paul Cramer to his estranged secret wife Babe Carey on &quot;All My Children&quot; ultimately leads to an extensive 2004 &quot;baby switch&quot; storyline which features crossovers of over 20 characters between the two series. With his sister Kelly Cramer desperate for a child to save her marriage after miscarrying her own, Paul finds himself delivering the babies of both Babe and her friend Bianca Montgomery during a rainstorm and subsequent flood in nearby Pine Valley on March 24, 2004. Paul stages a crash with his medical evacuation helicopter; he takes AJ Chandler for Kelly, gives Miranda Montgomery to Babe, and tells Bianca that her baby had died in the accident. Unaware of the child&#x27;s origins, Kelly brings Babe&#x27;s infant back to Llanview, passing him off as her child with her husband Kevin Buchanan. Months later, Babe discovers that her daughter is really the grieving Bianca&#x27;s, but remains silent and allows Paul to manipulate her. Meanwhile, a devastated Kelly discovers that Paul had stolen her son from his mother and, desperate for cash, he blackmails Kelly by threatening to reveal the secret to Kevin. Bianca&#x27;s daughter is returned to her for Christmas 2004, and once Kevin learns the truth, he and Kelly return Babe&#x27;s son as well in 2005.

While &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was off the air from February 2012 to March 2013, the characters of Todd Manning, Starr Manning and John McBain moved to the setting of &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Port Charles, New York.

After the Prospect Park lawsuit was dismissed, the character of Nora Buchanan made appearances on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 2017.

==Awards==
&quot;One Life to Live&quot; and many of its actors and crew have been nominated for dozens of awards, winning on many occasions. Erika Slezak has received six Daytime Emmy Awards for her acting, a feat tied only by Anthony Geary and Justin Deas.

In 1993, the series won its first GLAAD Media Award for its storyline on homosexuality and intolerance featuring newcomer Ryan Phillippe as Billy Douglas, a teenager who amidst scandal confides his homosexuality in Andrew Carpenter, played by Robert Krimmer. The character is the first openly gay teenager featured in a television series, and is considered groundbreaking in daytime television. The story arc also included an on-air ceremony for the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. In 2005, the series was awarded another GLAAD Media Award for its coverage of LGBT issues in the 2004 coming out storyline of gay character Mark Solomon (Matt Cavenaugh). &quot;One Life to Live&quot; won the same award again in 2010 for a well-publicized storyline in which police officer Oliver Fish comes out and reunites with his former college boyfriend and medical school student Kyle Lewis.

ABC cemented its reputation as a youth-oriented network in daytime with the addition of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; to its schedule, with much of the rest of its lineup consisting of soap operas like &quot;Dark Shadows,&quot; sitcom reruns, and game shows packaged by Chuck Barris. &quot;One Life to Live&quot; replaced the short-lived &quot;The Baby Game,&quot; in a three-way shuffle with &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and &quot;The Dating Game&quot;. The network placed the new serial at 3:30 PM Eastern, against CBS&#x27;s established hit &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; and the popular NBC game &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say!&quot;. Despite the tough competition, the intense tone of the plot and strong characters allowed the show to get a leg up on &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say,&quot; wearing that game down to the point of its cancellation in September 1969; NBC replaced the Tom Kennedy-hosted game in that time slot with three unsuccessful serials: &quot;Bright Promise&quot;, &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot;, and &quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot;.

&quot;One Life to Live&quot; initially enjoyed fair-to-middling ratings, but rose rapidly as it entered the 1970s, along with the rest of ABC&#x27;s daytime lineup. Matters greatly improved for &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1972, when CBS relocated &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; in response to packager Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s demands. The four-year-old show topped the ratings for the first time over CBS&#x27; declining &quot;The Secret Storm,&quot; and later, the game &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Talking,&quot; which ran for only 13 weeks.

By 1975, NBC became a serious player in that time slot for the first time in over five years when it expanded its strong soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; to an hour, with its second half occupying the 3:30 timeslot. &quot;One Life to Live&quot; lost a substantial audience share, but its lead-in, &quot;General Hospital,&quot; experienced even worse losses. ABC then expanded both &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot; to 45 minutes, with each composing half of a 90-minute block between 2:30 PM and 4 PM. Beginning on July 26, 1976, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; assumed the first position, at 2:30. ABC bet its hopes on viewers staying tuned past the half hour, making them unlikely to switch channels to &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot; reruns on CBS (or &quot;The Match Game&quot; in the case of &quot;General Hospital&quot; fans). This approach showed some promise, until November 7, 1977, when CBS expanded &quot;Guiding Light&quot; to an hour. As &quot;One Life to Live&quot; struggled, its neighbor &quot;General Hospital&quot; was in danger of cancellation after a 15-year run. In order to save &quot;General Hospital&quot; (which was airing at 3:15 PM) from cancellation, ABC expanded both soaps to an hour beginning on January 16, 1978; &quot;The $20,000 Pyramid&quot; was moved to the noon Eastern timeslot, where it remained until its run ended in June 1980. ABC contemplated an expansion of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; to a full hour if either of these shows were cancelled.

&quot;General Hospital&quot; rose rapidly to the top spot in the Nielsen ratings by 1979. As for &quot;One Life to Live,&quot; from its tenth birthday onward, its competitors declined in popularity. &quot;Search for Tomorrow,&quot; for instance, spent its last several months on CBS against the last half of &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Its replacement, &quot;Capitol&quot;, did little better, and after its cancellation, CBS aligned &quot;As the World Turns&quot; against &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot;, a configuration that stayed in place until &quot;Another World&quot;&#x27;s cancellation in 1999. The 1980s saw &quot;One Life to Live&quot; reach the height of its popularity, with an estimate of 9 million viewers early in the decade. The show typically ranked between the second and the fourth position in the 1980s.

Since 1991, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; returned to the middle of the pack, but its numbers declined, in common with all other soap operas. By the decade&#x27;s end, the show rested near the bottom of the ratings pack, and it continued to hover around the lower reaches of the weekly ratings throughout the 2000s in terms of total number of viewers; however, the show tended to rank in the mid-range for the target demographic of women aged 18–49, often higher than sister show &quot;All My Children&quot; and usually still winning its timeslot in the key demographic, well ahead of its competitors such as &quot;As The World Turns&quot;, &quot;Another World&quot;, and &quot;Passions&quot;. During the 2000s (decade), &quot;One Life to Live&quot; ran about even with &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, with NBC&#x27;s &quot;Another World&quot; replacement &quot;Passions&quot; trailing significantly.

The 2009-2010 season was a particularly difficult year for &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. During the week of June 28, 2010, the show ranked last among all soap operas with 2.1 million viewers, compared to 2.3 million for &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. As &quot;One Life to Live&quot; entered the 2010-2011 season, ratings improved, but not enough to prevent ABC from cancelling the program on April 14, 2011. After the cancellation announcement, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; began to surpass &quot;General Hospital&quot; in total number of viewers, but &quot;General Hospital&quot; continued to dominate &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in several specific categories, most notably the key demographic of women between 18 and 49 years old, usually prioritized by daytime networks. By November 2011, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; had dethroned &quot;General Hospital&quot; in every category. Overall, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was the third highest rated program among the five remaining soap operas in its last season, trailing &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, but ahead of &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. The show averaged a 2.3 rating and 3.12 million daily viewers during its final week. Its final episode on January 13, 2012 drew in a 2.7 rating and 3.848 million viewers, one of the highest ratings in the history of soap opera finales.

The &quot;One Life to Live&quot; continuation&#x27;s ratings proved impressive. The first episode was the second most downloaded TV episode on iTunes and second most watched episode on Hulu, with the first place on both sites going to &quot;All My Children&quot; which premiered the same day.

<text>The Palace Museum (), also known as the Beijing Palace Museum, is a large national museum complex housed in the Forbidden City at the core of Beijing, China. With , the museum inherited the imperial royal palaces from the Ming and Qing dynasties of China and opened to the public in 1925 after the last Emperor of China was evicted.

Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the museum consists of 980 buildings. It is home to over 1.8 million pieces of art, mostly from the imperial collection of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The 20th century saw its expansion through new acquisitions, transfers from other museums, and new archaeological discoveries.

According to the &quot;Beijing Evening Post&quot;, the museum has seen more than 17 million visitors in 2018, making it the world&#x27;s most visited museum. It has an average of 15 million visitors annually since 2012. Due to this increased pressure, the management has set a daily limit for visitors of 80,000 since 2015 to protect the structure and the experience.

==History==


=== Palace ===

The Palace Museum is housed in the Forbidden City, the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty. It is located in the middle of Beijing, China. For almost five centuries, it served as the home of the emperor and his household, and the ceremonial and political centre of Chinese government.

Built from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 surviving buildings with 8,707 bays of rooms and covers . The palace complex exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture, and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, and is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world.

=== Museum ===

In 1912, Puyi, the last emperor of China, abdicated. Under an agreement with the new Republic of China government, Puyi remained in the Inner Court, while the Outer Court was given over to public use, where a small museum was set up to display artifacts housed in the Outer Court. In 1924, Puyi was evicted from the Inner Court after a coup. The Palace Museum was then established in the Forbidden City on Double Ten Day (October 10), 1925.

The collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection. According to the results of a 1925 audit, some 1.17 million pieces of art were stored in the Forbidden City. In addition, the imperial libraries housed countless rare books and historical documents, including government documents of the Ming and Qing dynasties.

From 1933, the threat of Japanese invasion forced the evacuation of the most important parts of the museum&#x27;s collection. After the end of World War II, this collection was returned to Nanjing. However, with the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s victory imminent in the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek ordered the evacuation of the pick of this collection to Taiwan. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artifacts, 2,972 boxes are now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. This relatively small but high-quality collection today forms the core of that museum. More than 8,000 boxes were returned to Beijing, but 2,221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the Nanjing Museum.

Under the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the museum conducted a new audit as well as a thorough search of the Forbidden City, uncovering a number of important items. In addition, the government moved items from other museums around the country to replenish the Palace Museum&#x27;s collection. It also purchased and received donations from the public.

==Collections==
Today, there are over a million rare and valuable works of art in the permanent collection of the Palace Museum, including paintings, ceramics, seals, steles, sculptures, inscribed wares, bronze wares, enamel objects, etc. The collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection. According to the results of a 1925 audit, some 1.17 million pieces of art were stored in the Forbidden City. From 1933, the threat of Japanese invasion forced the evacuation of the most important parts of the museum&#x27;s collection. After the end of World War II, this collection was returned to Nanjing. However, with the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s victory imminent in the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government decided to ship the pick of this collection to Taiwan. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artifacts, 2,972 boxes are now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. More than 8,000 boxes were returned to Beijing, but 2,221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the Nanjing Museum. According to an inventory of the museum&#x27;s collection conducted between 2004 and 2010, the Palace Museum holds a total of 1,807,558 artifacts and includes 1,684,490 items designated as nationally protected &quot;valuable cultural relics.&quot; At the end of 2016, the Palace Museum held a press conference, announcing that 55,132 previously unlisted items had been discovered in an inventory check carried out from 2014 to 2016. The total number of items in the Palace Museum collection is presently at 1,862,690 objects.
===Ceramics===
The Palace Museum holds 340,000 pieces of ceramics and porcelain. As well as other pieces, these include imperial collections from the Tang and Song dynasties, as well as pieces commissioned by the palace, and, sometimes, by the emperor personally. This collection is notable because it derives from the imperial collection, and thus represents the best of porcelain production in China; other large collections are in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and the Nanjing Museum.

The ceramic collection of the Palace Museum represents a comprehensive record of Chinese ceramic production over the past 8,000 years, as well as one of the largest such collections in the world.

===Painting===
The Palace Museum holds close to 50,000 paintings. Of these, more than 400 date from before the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). This is the largest such collection in China and includes some of the rarest and most valuable paintings in Chinese history.

The collection is based on the palace collection of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The personal interest of emperors such as Qianlong meant that one of the most important collections of paintings in Chinese history was held at the palace. However, a significant portion of this collection was lost. After his abdication, Puyi transferred paintings out of the palace, and many of these were subsequently lost or destroyed. In 1948, some of the best parts of the collection were moved to Taiwan. The collection has since been gradually replenished, through donations, purchases, and transfers from other museums.

===Jade===
Jade has a unique place in Chinese culture. The museum&#x27;s collection, mostly derived from the imperial collection, includes some 30,000 pieces. The pre-Yuan dynasty part of the collection includes several pieces famed throughout history, as well as artifacts from more recent archaeological discoveries. The earliest pieces date from the Neolithic period. Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty pieces, on the other hand, include both items for palace use, as well as tribute items from around the empire and beyond.

===Sculpture===

===Bronzeware===
Bronze holds an important place in Chinese culture, and was always an important part of state ceremony. The Palace Museum&#x27;s bronze collection dates from the early Shang dynasty. Of the almost 10,000 pieces held, about 1600 are inscribed items from the pre-Qin period (to 221 BC). A significant part of the collection is ceremonial bronzeware from the imperial court, including complete sets of musical instruments used by the imperial orchestras.

===Timepiece===
The Palace Museum has one of the largest collections of mechanical timepieces of the 18th and 19th centuries in the world, with more than 1,000 pieces. The collection contains both Chinese- and foreign-made pieces. Chinese pieces came from the palace&#x27;s own workshops, Guangzhou (Canton) and Suzhou (Suchow). Foreign pieces came from countries including Britain, France, Switzerland, the United States and Japan. Of these, the largest portion come from Britain.

Notable pieces in the collection include a clock with an attached automaton which is able to write, with a miniature writing brush on inserted paper, an auspicious couplet in perfect Chinese calligraphy.

===Palace artifact===
In addition to works of art, a large proportion of the museum&#x27;s collection consists of the artifacts of the imperial court. This includes items used by the imperial family and the palace in daily life, as well as various ceremonial and bureaucratic items important to government administration. This comprehensive collection preserves the daily life and ceremonial protocols of the imperial era.

==Exhibitions==
The permanent exhibitions of the museum can be divided into two types, one is the as-was exhibition (), one is the themed exhibitions (). The as-was exhibitions present the rooms in similar manners as the imperial time. There are eleven dedicated themed exhibitions halls:

# Digital

<text>The Plaza Accord was a joint agreement signed on September 22, 1985, at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, between France, West Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, to depreciate the U.S. dollar in relation to the French franc, the German Deutsche Mark, the Japanese yen and the British pound sterling by intervening in currency markets. The U.S. dollar depreciated significantly from the time of the agreement until it was replaced by the Louvre Accord in 1987. Some commentators believe the Plaza Accord contributed to the Japanese asset price bubble of the late 1980s.

==Background==
The tight monetary policy of Federal Reserve&#x27;s Chairman Paul Volcker and the expansionary fiscal policy of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s first term in 1981–84 pushed up long-term interest rates and attracted capital inflow, appreciating the dollar. The French government was strongly in favor of currency intervention to reduce it, but US administration officials, such as Treasury Secretary Donald Regan and Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs, Beryl Sprinkel, opposed such plans, considering the strong dollar a vote of confidence in the US economy and supporting the concept of free market above all else. At the 1982 G7 Versailles Summit, the US agreed to a request by the other members to a study of the effectiveness of foreign currency intervention, which resulted in the Jurgensen Report at the 1983 G7 Williamsburg Summit, but it was not as supportive of intervention as the other leaders had hoped. As the dollar&#x27;s appreciation kept rising and the trade deficit grew even more, the second Reagan administration viewed currency intervention in a different light. In January 1985, James Baker became the new Treasury Secretary and Baker&#x27;s aide Richard Darman became Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. David Mulford joined as the new Assistant Secretary for International Affairs.

From 1980 to 1985, the dollar had appreciated by about 50% against the Japanese yen, Deutsche Mark, French franc, and British pound, the currencies of the next four biggest economies at the time.
In March 1985, just before the G7, the dollar reached its highest valuation ever against the British pound, a valuation which would remain untopped for over 30 years. This caused considerable difficulties for the American industry, but at first, their lobbying was largely ignored by the government. The financial sector was able to profit from the rising dollar, and a depreciation would have run counter to the Reagan administration&#x27;s plans for bringing down inflation. A broad alliance of manufacturers, service providers, and farmers responded by running an increasingly high-profile campaign asking for protection against foreign competition. Major players included grain exporters, the U.S. automotive industry, heavy American manufacturers like Caterpillar Inc., as well as high-tech companies including IBM and Motorola. By 1985, their campaign had acquired sufficient traction for Congress to begin considering passing protectionist laws. The negative prospect of trade restrictions spurred the White House to begin the negotiations that led to the Plaza Accord.

The devaluation was justified to reduce the U.S. current account deficit, which had reached 3.5% of the GDP, and to help the U.S. economy to emerge from a serious recession that began in the early 1980s. The U.S. Federal Reserve System under Paul Volcker had halted the stagflation crisis of the 1970s by raising interest rates. The increased interest rate sufficiently controlled domestic monetary policy and staved off inflation. By the mid-1970s, Nixon successfully convinced several OPEC countries to trade oil only in USD, and the US would, in return, give them regional military support. This sudden infusion of international demand for dollars gave the USD the infusion it needed in the 1970s. However, a strong dollar is a double edged sword, inducing the Triffin dilemma which, on the one hand, gave more spending power to domestic consumers, companies, and to the US government, and on the other hand, hampered US exports until the value of the dollar re-equilibrated. The U.S. automobile industry was unable to recover.

==Meeting at the Plaza Hotel==
At the 17 January 1985 G5 meeting attended by James Baker, a small amount of currency intervention to depreciate the dollar was agreed upon and subsequently took place. US intervention was small in those months, but the German authorities intervened heavily to sell dollars in foreign exchange markets in February and March. In April at an OECD meeting, the US announced their potential interest in a meeting between the major industrial countries on the subject of international monetary reform, and preparations for the Plaza meeting began, with preparatory meetings by G5 deputies in July and August. On 22 September 1985, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the United States, France, Germany, Japan and Great Britain met at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and came to an agreement on the announcement that &quot;some further orderly appreciation of the non-dollar currencies is desirable&quot; and they &quot;stand ready to cooperate more closely to encourage this when to do so would be helpful&quot;. The following Monday, when the meeting was made public, the dollar fell 4 percent in comparison to the other currencies.

== Effects ==
=== Trade deficit ===
While for the first two years, the US deficit only worsened, it then began to turn around as the elasticities had risen enough that the quantity effects began to outweigh the valuation effect. The devaluation made U.S. exports cheaper to purchase for its trading partners, which in turn allegedly meant that other countries would buy more American-made goods and services. The Plaza Accord failed to help reduce the U.S.–Japan trade deficit, but it did reduce the U.S. deficit with other countries by making U.S. exports more competitive. And thus, the US Congress refrained from enacting protectionist trade barriers.

=== Objective failure ===
Joseph E. Gagnon describes the Plaza&#x27;s result being more due to the message that was sent to the financial markets about policy intentions and the implied threat of further dollar sales than actual policies. Intervention was far more pronounced in the opposite direction following the 1987 Louvre Accord, when the dollar&#x27;s depreciation was decided to be halted.

The Plaza Accord was successful in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Western European nations, but largely failed to fulfill its primary objective of alleviating the trade deficit with Japan. This deficit was due to structural conditions that were insensitive to monetary policy, specifically trade conditions. The manufactured goods of the United States became more competitive in the exports market, though were still largely unable to succeed in the Japanese domestic market due to Japan&#x27;s structural restrictions on imports. The Louvre Accord was signed in 1987 to halt the continuing decline of the U.S. dollar.

Following the subsequent 1987 Louvre Accord, there were few other interventions in the dollar&#x27;s exchange rate such as by the first Clinton Administration in 1992–95. However, since then, currency interventions have been few among the G7. The European Central Bank supported in 2000 then over-depreciated euro. The Bank of Japan intervened for the last time in 2011, with the cooperation of the US and others to dampen strong appreciation of the yen after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2013, the G7 members agreed to refrain from foreign exchange intervention. Since then, the US administration has demanded stronger international policies against currency manipulation (to be differentiated from monetary stimulus).

The signing of the Plaza Accord was significant in that it reflected Japan&#x27;s emergence as a real player in managing the international monetary system. However, the rising yen may also have contributed to recessionary pressures for Japan&#x27;s economy, to which the Japanese government reacted with massive expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. That stimulus in combination with other policies led to the Japanese asset price bubble of the late 1980s. Because of this, some commentators blame the Plaza Accord for the bubble, which, when burst, led into a protracted period of deflation and low growth in Japan known as the Lost Decade, which has effects still heavily felt in modern Japan. Jeffrey Frankel disagrees on the timing, pointing out that between the 1985–86 years of appreciation of the yen and the 1990s recession, came the bubble years of 1987–89 when the exchange rate no longer pushed the yen up. The rising Deutsche Mark also did not lead to an economic bubble or a recession in Germany. Economist Richard Werner says that external pressures such as the accord and the policy of Ministry of Finance to reduce the official discount rate are insufficient in explaining the actions taken by the Bank of Japan that led to the bubble.

<doc id="341997" wikidata="Q1456595" url="?curid=341997" title="Culture of Georgia (country)">
<text>The culture of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has evolved over the country&#x27;s long history, providing it with a unique national identity and a strong literary tradition based on the Georgian language and alphabet. This strong sense of national identity has helped to preserve Georgian distinctiveness despite repeated periods of foreign occupation.

==Culture of Ancient and Old Georgia==

The Georgian alphabet is traditionally said to have been invented in the 3rd century BC and reformed by King Parnavaz I of Iberia in 284 BC. Most modern scholarship puts its origin date at some time in the 5th century AD, when the earliest examples can be found.

Georgia&#x27;s medieval culture was greatly influenced by Eastern Orthodox Christianity and the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church, which promoted and often sponsored the creation of many works of religious devotion. These included churches and monasteries, works of art such as icons, and hagiographies of Georgian saints. In addition, many secular works of national history, mythology, and hagiography were also written.

==Georgian culture throughout history==

Georgian culture enjoyed a renaissance of classical literature, arts, philosophy, architecture and science in the 11th century. Over the course of centuries, to varying degrees it was influenced by Classical Greece, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, various Persian empires (e.g. Achaemenid, Sassanian, and Safavid), the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. 

This long history has provided a national narrative which encompasses the successful preservation of unique culture and identity in a consistent territory, despite powerful external pressures from different directions. Christianity and the Georgian language are particularly important national identifiers. 

The first Georgian-language printing house was established in the 1620s in Italy, and the first one in Georgia itself was founded in 1709 in Tbilisi.

Georgian theatre has a long history; its oldest national form was the &quot;Sakhioba&quot; (extant from the 3rd century BC to the 17th century AD). The Georgian National Theatre was founded in 1791 in Tbilisi, by the writer, dramatist, and diplomat Giorgi Avalishvili (1769–1850). Its leading actors were Dimitri Aleksi-Meskhishvili, David Machabeli, David Bagrationi, Dimitri Cholokashvili, and others.

In Tbilisi, the Museum of the Caucasus was founded in 1845. In the 1920s, it became the State Museum of Georgia. The Tbilisi State Theatre of Opera and Ballet was established in 1851.

Greatest representatives of Georgian culture of the 19th century were: Nikoloz Baratashvili (poet), Alexander Orbeliani (writer), Vakhtang Orbeliani (poet), Dimitri Kipiani (writer), Grigol Orbeliani (poet), Ilia Chavchavadze (writer and poet), Akaki Tsereteli (poet), Alexander Kazbegi (writer), Rapiel Eristavi (poet), Mamia Gurieli (poet), Iakob Gogebashvili (writer), Simon Gugunava (poet), Babo Avalishvili-Kherkheulidze (actor), Nikoloz Avalishvili (actor), Nikoloz Aleksi-Meskhishvili (actor), Romanoz Gvelesiani (painter), Grigol Maisuradze (painter), Alexandre Beridze (painter), Ivane Machabeli (translator), Okropir Bagrationi (translator), Sardion Aleksi-Meskhishvili (translator), Kharlampi Savaneli (opera singer), Pilimon Koridze (opera singer), Lado Agniashvili (folk singer), Alois Mizandary (composer), etc.

The first cinema in Georgia was established in Tbilisi on November 16, 1896. The first Georgian cinema documentary (&quot;Journey of Akaki Tsereteli in Racha-Lechkhumi&quot;) was shot in 1912 by Vasil Amashukeli (1886–1977), while the first Georgian feature film (&quot;Kristine&quot;) was shot in 1916 by Alexandre Tsutsunava (1881–1955).

The Tbilisi State Academy of Arts was founded in 1917.

Georgian culture suffered under the rule of the Soviet Union during the 20th century, during which a policy of Russification was imposed but was strongly resisted by many Georgians. Since the independence of Georgia in 1991, a cultural resurgence has taken place, albeit somewhat hampered by the country&#x27;s economic and political difficulties in the post-Soviet era.

==Cuisine==
Georgian cuisine refers to the cooking styles and dishes created by the Georgians. The Georgian cuisine is unique to the country, but also carries some influences from other Caucasian, Eastern European and nearby Middle Eastern culinary traditions. Each historical province of Georgia has its own distinct culinary tradition, with variations such as Abkhazian, Megrelian, Kakhetian, Imeretian, Svanetian, Pshavian, Tushian, Kartlian, Gurian, Meskhian, Rachian and Adjarian cuisines. Rich with meat dishes, the Georgian cuisine also offers a variety of vegetarian dishes.

Georgian cuisine is the result of the broad interplay of culinary ideas carried along the Silk Road Trade route by merchants and travelers alike. The importance of both food and drink to Georgian culture is best observed during a feast called &quot;supra&quot;, when a huge assortment of dishes are prepared, always accompanied by large amounts of local wine, known to be one of the world&#x27;s oldest wines, produced in ancient authentic Georgian underground &quot;kvevri&quot; clay pots (dating 8 century BC). In a Georgian feast, the role of the &quot;tamada&quot; (toastmaster) is an important and honoured position.

<text>Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika (KUT) is the name on British postage stamps made for use in the British colonies of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika. The stamps were circulated between 1935 and 1963 by the joint postal service of the three colonies, the East African Posts and Telecommunications Administration, reconstituted as part of the East African High Commission from 1948 to 1961, the East African Common Services Organization from 1961 to 1967, and the East African Community from 1967 to 1977. Even after independence, the new separate nations continued to use the KUT stamps, and they remained valid for postage until 1977.

==First K.U.T. stamps==

The first stamps marked Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika were issued in 1935, in the form of common design commemoratives for the Silver Jubilee of King George V as well as a definitive series featuring a profile of the king and local scenes. They replaced stamps marked &quot;East Africa and Uganda Protectorates&quot; and &quot;Kenya and Uganda&quot;. The definitives included a dramatic departure from the usual engraved stamps of the period; the 10c and £1 stamp were typographed and had a silhouette of a lion, with color combinations of black/yellow and black/red, respectively.

==George VI==

The same designs were reissued in 1938 with a profile of George VI. Wartime exigencies forced the use of surcharges on four South African stamps in 1941 and 1942, but after the war the usual common types (Peace Issue, Silver Wedding Issue, etc.) resumed.

==Queen Elizabeth II==
A definitive series, with new designs, was issued in 1954 for Queen Elizabeth, and in 1958 a pair of commemoratives marked the 100th anniversary of the discovery (from a European perspective) of the Great Lakes of Africa by Burton and Speke.

A new definitive series in 1960 used simpler and more symbolic designs, and was followed in 1963 by three sets of commemoratives. At this point postal service was taken over by the East African Common Services Organization, which issued commemoratives for the 1964 Summer Olympics inscribed &quot;Uganda, Kenya, Tanganyika, Zanzibar&quot;, even though they were never actually used in Zanzibar. After Tanganyika merged with Zanzibar to form Tanzania, subsequent stamps were inscribed &quot;Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania&quot;, with the three names being listed in randomly varying orders.

These stamps were issued in parallel with stamps from each of the newly independent nations. The Common Services Organization continued to issue various commemoratives, at the rate of about 10-12 per year, until early in 1976.

<text>Vasily Grigoryevich Lazarev (; 23 February 1928 31 December 1990) was a Soviet cosmonaut who flew on the Soyuz 12 spaceflight as well as the abortive Soyuz 18a launch on 5 April 1975.

He was injured by the high acceleration of the abort and landing and was initially denied his spaceflight bonus pay, having to appeal directly to Leonid Brezhnev to receive it. Brezhnev was at the time the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Lazarev held a degree in medicine and the rank of colonel in the Soviet Air Force. He remained in the space programme until failing a physical in 1981. He never fully recovered from the injuries sustained on Soyuz 18a and died on the last day of 1990 at the age of 62.

He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, the title Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR and the Order of Lenin.

<text>Braulio Castillo Cintrón (March 30, 1933 – February 28, 2015) was a telenovela actor in Latin America. His two sons, Braulio Castillo, Jr. and Jorge Castillo, are also actors. He was born in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.

Castillo played in the &quot;Orquesta Mandolina&quot; in Puerto Rico, before working as an actor. He graduated from the University of Puerto Rico with a major in the performing arts. He had roles in Puerto Rican television soap operas, during the 1950s, including &quot;El derecho de nacer&quot;; he worked at Telemundo
Puerto Rico productions.

Castillo later relocated to Peru, where he performed the leading role in the telenovela, &quot;Simplemente María&quot; (&quot;Simply Mary&quot;), with Peruvian actress Saby Kamalich. There, Castillo was the first MC of the international children&#x27;s puppet show based on the Italian fictional character of Topo Gigio.

He then moved to Mexico during the 1960s, and performed in Mexican films such as &quot;El Cielo y Tu&quot; (&quot;Heaven and You&quot;), among others, and working in several Televisa productions.

In 1970 Castillo was hit in the head by a rock, while filming a scene for a movie. He survived, but retired from the entertainment business. He still occasionally made appearances on television.

<doc id="342006" wikidata="Q2910544" url="?curid=342006" title="Boosterism">
<text>Boosterism is the act of promoting (&quot;boosting&quot;) a town, city, or organization, with the goal of improving public perception of it. Boosting can be as simple as talking up the entity at a party or as elaborate as establishing a visitors&#x27; bureau.

==History==
Greenland is claimed to owe its name to an act of boosterism. The &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; states that Erik the Red named the island &quot;Greenland&quot; because &quot;men will desire much the more to go there if the land has a good name.&quot;

During the expansion of the American and Canadian West, boosterism became epidemic as the leaders and owners of small towns made extravagant predictions for their settlement, in the hope of attracting more residents and, not coincidentally, inflating the prices of local real estate. During the nineteenth century, competition for economic success among newly founded cities led to overflow of booster literature that listed the visible signs of growth, cited statistics on population and trade and looked to local geography for town success reasons. 

The 1871 humorous speech &quot;The Untold Delights of Duluth&quot;, delivered by Democratic U.S. Representative J. Proctor Knott, lampooned boosterism. Boosterism is also a major theme of two novels by Sinclair Lewis—&quot;Main Street&quot; (published 1920) and &quot;Babbitt&quot; (1922). As indicated by an editorial that Lewis wrote in 1908 entitled &quot;The Needful Knocker&quot;, boosting was the opposite of knocking. The editorial explained:

The short story &quot;Jeeves and the Hard-boiled Egg&quot; (1917) by P.G. Wodehouse includes an encounter with a convention visiting from the fictional town of Birdsburg, Missouri who talk up their town:

Boosting is also done in political settings, especially in regard to disputed policies or controversial events. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson is strongly associated with such behaviour.

<text>Donald Cargill (1619 – 27 July 1681) was a Scottish Covenanter who worked to uphold the principles of the National Covenant of 1638 and Solemn League and Covenant of 1643 to establish and defend Presbyterianism. He was born around 1619, and was the eldest son of Laurence Cargill of Bonnytoun, Rattray, Perthshire, a notary public, and Marjory Blair. He was educated perhaps at University of Aberdeen and at the University of St Andrews, where he matriculated as a student of St Salvator&#x27;s College in 1645. He was licensed by the Presbytery of St Andrews on 13 April 1653 and was ordained in 1655. He was later deprived by the Privy Council, on 1 October 1662, for disobeying the Act of Parliament in not keeping a day of thanksgiving for His Majesty&#x27;s Restoration, and not obtaining presentation and collation from the archbishop before 20 September. He was ordered at the same time to remove beyond the River Tay before 1 November under penalties. Disregarding this sentence, he was charged to appear before the Council on 7 January 1669, and appointed to continue in his confinement, but on petition he was allowed to visit Edinburgh about law affairs. He turned down an offer of a parish at 
Eaglesham and refused to appear before the privy council to account for his unauthorised preaching. On 16 July 1674 he was affectedly outlawed for holding conventicles and subsequently declared a traitor. In 1679 he joined Richard Cameron in founding the Cameronians (afterwards the Reformed Presbyterians), who embodied their principles in a Declaration at Sanquhar, on 22 June 1680, disowning the king&#x27;s authority. A reward of 3000 merks was offered for his apprehension, dead or alive. For excommunicating at Torwood in September 1680 Charles II., James, Duke of York, and others, the Privy Council increased the reward to 5000 merks. After numerous hair-breadth escapes he was apprehended at Covington Mill, Lanarkshire, during the night of 12 July 1681 by a party of dragoons led by James Irving of Bonshaw (who got the reward). Tried for treason before the High Court of Justiciary, he 
was found guilty, and executed at the Cross of Edinburgh with four others [Walter Smith, William Cuthil, William 
Thomson, James Boig], 27 July 1681. His forfeiture was rescinded by Act of Parliament 4 July 1690. He married Margaret (died 12 Aug. 1656, within a year and a day of their marriage), daughter of Nicol Brown, burgess of Edinburgh, widow of Andrew Bethune of Blebo.

==Life==



===Early life===
He was born at Rattray, Blairgowrie and educated at Aberdeen and St Andrews universities. In 1655 he was appointed Minister to the Barony Church in Glasgow. From the first he was a man of deep convictions and intense fidelity to them, but he did not become prominent till the time of the king&#x27;s restoration.

===Day of thanksgiving===
On 29 May 1662, on a day of thanksgiving for the Restoration of Charles II, he startled his congregation by beginning his sermon as follows: 
As a result of his protest, he was dismissed. Cargill was deprived of his benefice and banished beyond the Tay by the privy council (1 October 1662). He disregarded the sentence, became a field preacher, and was conspicuous for the earnestness with which he denounced the presbyterian ministers who accepted the &#x27;indulgence&#x27; in 1672. On 16 July 1674 and 6 August 1675 decreets were passed against him for holding conventicles and other offenses.

===Bothwell Bridge and flight to Holland===
Cargill was wounded at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge on 22 June 1679 between Royalists and Covenanters, and fled to the Netherlands.

===The Queensferry Paper===
Returning to Scotland in 1680, Cargill drafted a declaration of principles, contained in the document known as &quot;The Queensferry Paper&quot; which fell into government hands on 4 June when he narrowly escaped arrest at an inn in the town of Queensferry. It called for signatories to &quot;overthrow the kingdom of darkness&quot; and pledge that &quot;We shall to our power relieve the church and subjects of this kingdom of that opposition that hath been exercised upon their consciences, civil rights and liberties, that men may serve him holily, without fear, and possess their civil rights in quietness, without disturbance.&quot; It accused the rulers of having &quot;degenerated from the virtue and good government of their predecessors into tyranny; governed contrary to all right laws, exercised such tyranny and arbitrary government, oppressed men in their consciences and civil rights ...&quot;, and affirmed in its final article that, &quot;We bind and oblige ourselves to defend ourselves, and one another, in our worshipping of God, and in our natural, civil and divine rights and liberties, till we shall overcome, or send them down under debate to posterity, that they may begin where we end.&quot;

===Sanquhar Declaration===
On 22 June 1680 Cargill&#x27;s associate Richard Cameron issued the Sanquhar Declaration, calling for war against King Charles II and the exclusion of his brother, afterwards James VII, from the succession. After Cameron&#x27;s death in July at the hand of dragoons, Cargill continued to preach in the Torwood near Stirling and in September pronounced the sentence of excommunication against the key government figures who were persecuting the Covenanters: Charles II, James, Duke of York and James, Duke of Monmouth, Privy Councillors, John, Duke of Lauderdale and John, Duke of Rothes, the King&#x27;s Advocate, Sir George McKenzie, and General Tam Dalziel of the Binns. The following extract gives a flavour of the pronouncement,

:&quot;I, being a minister of Jesus Christ, and having authority and power from Him, do, in His name and by His spirit (...) excommunicate and cast out of the true Church, and deliver up to Satan, James, Duke of Monmouth, for coming into Scotland at his father&#x27;s unjust command and leading armies against the Lord&#x27;s people, who were constrained to rise, being killed in and for the worshipping of the true God, and for refusing, that morning, a cessation of arms at Bothwell Bridge, for hearing and redressing their injuries, wrongs and oppressions.&quot;

===At Torwood===
In September, at Torwood, between Stirling and Falkirk, he pronounced, without concert with any one, a solemn sentence of excommunication against the king, the Duke of York, Duke of Monmouth, Duke of Lauderdale, Duke of Rothes, Sir George Mackenzie, and Sir Thomas Dalzell. The Torwood excommunication was published in 1741. A larger reward was therefore issued for his capture, and after many hair-breadth escapes he was taken on 12 September by James Irvine of Bonshaw at Covington Mill.

===Arrest and execution===
Eventually Cargill was arrested, sentenced to death and hanged in Edinburgh on 27 July 1681. He is reported to have said to the crowd, &quot;The Lord knows I go on this ladder with less fear and perturbation of mind, than ever I entered the pulpit to preach.&quot;.

There is a monument to him at his birthplace in Rattray, Perthshire; and his name also appears on the Covenanters&#x27; Memorial near Maybole, South Ayrshire.

===Personal life===
He married Margaret Browne, widow of Andrew Betham of Blebo, in 1655, but his wife died 12 August 1656.

Though Cargill&#x27;s very stringent views were not generally accepted by his countrymen, both he and his friend Cameron took a great hold on the popular sympathy and regard. Personally, Cargill was an amiable, kind-heart man, very self-denying, and thoroughly devoted to his duty. Wodrow ascribes some of his extreme sentiments to the influence of others. Among the people he seems to have won admiration for the profoundness of his convictions and the fearlessness with which he acted on them, when the result to himself could not fail to be ruinous. Some sermons, lectures, and his last speech and testimony have been printed; but Peter Walker in the &#x27;Remarkable Passages&#x27; in which he records his life in &#x27;Biographia Presbyteriana,&#x27; indicates that the impression produced by them was far inferior to that of his spoken discourses.

<doc id="342013" wikidata="Q1960052" url="?curid=342013" title="Kira Nerys">
<text>Kira Nerys ( ) is a fictional character in the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1993–1999). She was played by actress Nana Visitor. The character is from the fictional planet Bajor, a world which has recently emerged from a brutal foreign occupation. She was a member of the resistance, and the decades-long conflict has left her tough and uncompromising, but she is sustained by her strong faith in traditional Bajoran religion. She has been assigned to Deep Space Nine, a space station jointly operated by the United Federation of Planets and the new provisional Bajoran government, where she serves as second in command as well as the ranking representative of her people.

==Backstory==
Per Bajoran custom, her family name, Kira, precedes her given name, Nerys. She has two brothers (Kira Reon and Kira Pohl), and her parents&#x27; names are Kira Taban (played by Thomas Kopache throughout the series) and Kira Meru (played by Leslie Hope in &quot;Wrongs Darker than Death or Night&quot;).

The backstory of the character states that Kira Nerys was born 2343, in Dakhur province, Bajor, during the 50-year Cardassian occupation of the planet. She was raised in a labor camp. Her family were members of the artisan caste, namely sculptors of clay, or potters. At age 13, Kira was recruited into the Shakaar resistance cell, part of an underground movement which carried out guerrilla attacks against Cardassian military and civilians with the ultimate goal of ending the occupation.

==Story==
Kira is assigned as the senior Bajoran Militia officer aboard Deep Space Nine (DS9), acting as the station&#x27;s executive officer under the Starfleet Commander Benjamin Sisko, who commands the facility. Initially, Kira is opposed to the Federation presence on DS9, feeling that the Bajoran people should have nothing to do with the Federation, as she believes that Bajor needs to be able to stand on its own two feet, after enduring a long, brutal occupation by the Cardassians. Over time, her sentiments change and she becomes one of the strongest supporters of Bajor joining the Federation, and is a steadfast ally and friend of Sisko. She is deeply religious, which makes her relationship with Sisko somewhat complicated; not only is he her commanding officer, he is also the emissary of the Prophets, the Bajorans&#x27; gods. 

As a member of the Bajoran Militia, Kira is an invaluable help to Starfleet in its mission on DS9. She often commands Starfleet personnel as DS9&#x27;s executive officer. In the third season, she also serves as the first officer of the &quot;Defiant&quot;, a Starfleet warship based at DS9, until Lieutenant Commander Worf assumes that role in the fourth season. When the Dominion recaptures Deep Space Nine at the start of the Dominion War, at the end of the fifth season, Kira remains aboard the station as liaison officer, as a result of Bajor&#x27;s non-aggression pact with the Dominion. At the beginning of the sixth season, The Federation is losing the war against the Dominion and this, alongside a Vedek&#x27;s suicide which she witnesses, galvanizes Kira to start plotting a resistance movement against the Dominion. The movement is eventually successful in helping Starfleet retake the station and driving the Dominion back behind enemy lines.

Towards the end of the seventh and final season, Kira is promoted to colonel and temporarily commissioned as a Starfleet commander. She plays a significant role in helping the Cardassian Resistance wage a guerrilla war against the Dominion, being sent by Sisko to Cardassia itself to teach Damar and his followers the tactics she learned during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. At the conclusion of the war (and the end of the series), Kira takes command of DS9 after the disappearance of Sisko. She is still in command several years later as seen in the &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; Season 3 episode, &quot;Hear All, Trust Nothing&quot;. 

===Personal relationships===
Kira becomes romantically involved with Bareil Antos, a prominent Bajoran vedek (cleric). Following his death, she later becomes involved with Shakaar Edon, a former resistance leader during the Cardassian occupation, who later becomes Bajor&#x27;s First Minister. After a couple of years, accepting that the relationship is going nowhere (and after a visit to the Kenda Shrine on Bajor), the couple decide to end their relationship. Kira then forms a romantic relationship with the shapeshifter Odo, who had pined after her for years, though this too ends when Odo rejoins his people in the Gamma Quadrant at the conclusion of the series. Due to her alter ego depiction in the Mirror Universe it is speculated that Kira is canonically bisexual.

Kira also becomes the surrogate mother to Kirayoshi O&#x27;Brien, the then-unborn child of Chief Engineer Miles O&#x27;Brien and his wife Keiko. When the pregnant Keiko was injured in a shuttle accident, Dr Julian Bashir saves the fetus by transporting it into Kira&#x27;s womb. Kira continues to carry the fetus until birth, essentially becoming a part of the O&#x27;Brien family.

===Enemies===
Kira&#x27;s arch enemy is the former Cardassian head of Deep Space 9, Gul Dukat. At the beginning of the series, Kira despises Dukat for helping oversee the occupation of Bajor and takes every opportunity to antagonise him further. As the series progresses, the relationship slightly softens, particularly after Kira learns that Dukat has a half-Bajoran daughter named Ziyal whom he initially believed had been killed. Dukat&#x27;s military career and status suffer when he takes Ziyal back to Cardassia Prime and he and Kira join forces to help defend both Cardassia and Deep Space 9 against a Klingon invasion. 

After Dukat, with the aid of the Dominion, reassumes command of Deep Space 9, Kira realises that he is using Ziyal to try and get close to her and, from that point onward, their relationship is chiefly adversarial. After Dukat has been driven off the station, he later contacts Kira and discloses the close relationship he had with her mother Kira Meru, which Kira confirms after using the Orb of Time to travel back to witness the beginning of the relationship, which starts due to the Cardassians needing &quot;comfort women&quot;. Dukat and Kira have one final encounter in the seventh season when he abducts her to space station Empok Nor and reveals he has become the leader of a cult worshipping the evil Bajoran spirits known as the Pah-Wraiths. Kira only narrowly manages to stop Dukat orchestrating the deaths of his Bajoran followers through mass suicide before he transports off the station.

Kira also has a fractious relationship with Vedek (later Kai) Winn, a Bajoran religious leader who is in favour of separating her people from the influence of The Federation. In the final episode of the first season, Winn travels to Deep Space 9 in order to secretly plan the assassination of her rival (and Kira&#x27;s lover) Vedek Bareil but fails (although Kira is unable to concretely prove that Winn was responsible). Kira nearly prevents Winn becoming the new Kai, but realises that doing so would reveal the truth about her predecessor Kai Opaka&#x27;s role in a massacre and possibly lead Bajor into a civil war. Winn and Kira remain adversaries even when working together in Bajor&#x27;s interests, especially when Winn attempts to interfere in government matters. Later in the sixth season, Kira is possessed by a Prophet and nearly defeats a rival Pah-Wraith which has possessed Jake Sisko, but Winn floods the station with chroniton radiation and the reckoning is stopped; Kira is furious that Winn has defied the will of the Prophets and that the Pah-Wraiths remain at large.

In the final season, Winn again visits the station and Kira tries to convince her to step aside as Kai. A furious Winn refuses and this drives her into the arms of Dukat as they plan to release the Pah-Wraiths together.

===Non-canonical information===
In the licensed &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels (which are not considered canonical by Paramount), following the conclusion of the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, Kira Nerys takes charge of the Deep Space Nine space station as its permanent commanding officer. With the conclusion of the first wave of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; novels in &quot;Unity&quot;, Bajor finally joins the Federation, and Kira is given the Starfleet rank of Captain. Kira opens every Bajoran Orb simultaneously in a sacred place in order to defeat a monstrous enemy. This also causes the return of Benjamin Sisko from the Celestial Temple to the corporeal world.

In the 2019 documentary &quot;What We Left Behind&quot;, former showrunner Ira Steven Behr and several former writers of the series participated in a &quot;what-if&quot; planning session for an eighth season, where Kira has resigned from Starfleet and the Bajoran Militia and is a vedek in the Bajoran religious order.

===Mirror Universe===
The character of Kira Nerys also exists in the Mirror Universe. In the &quot;DS9&quot; episode &quot;Crossover&quot;, Kira encounters her mirror self, who is the cruel, powerful Intendant of the station (still called Terok Nor), with Elim Garak as her first officer. Kira convinces the mirror-Sisko to rebel against the Intendant-Kira and start the Terran Resistance. This group is later successful in taking command of Terok Nor and capturing the Intendant, but she manages to escape with the help of mirror-Nog. Eventually, the escaped Intendant convinces the alternate universe&#x27;s Bareil Antos to travel to the regular universe in order to obtain an Orb of the Prophets. The mirror Kira falls in love with her double from the other universe. At the time, Nana Visitor dismissed the idea of her character being bisexual, saying that she intended to portray this as &quot;total narcissism on her part. It had nothing to do with sexuality&quot;. However, later episodes continued to show her surrounded by a mixed-gender harem, and eventually depicted her being in a romantic relationship with her universe&#x27;s version of Ezri Tigan.

==Casting==
In the early stages of planning &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, the series&#x27; creators wanted to bring in the Bajoran character Ensign Ro Laren, who was a recurring character in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Michelle Forbes, who had portrayed Ensign Ro, turned down the offer, so a new Bajoran character was created instead. Nana Visitor had just given birth to a baby boy mere months before she was called to audition for the role of Kira Nerys, and her becoming a mother actually shaped her decision process for accepting or turning down roles. With the character of Kira Nerys, Visitor felt &quot;completely engaged on every level by the part&quot;.

Visitor almost turned down the role, as her manager told her &quot;you will kill your career if you do this job.&quot; Visitor said, &quot;By the end of the call, he had convinced me that I did want to be a part of it whether it impacted the rest of my career or not. When I read the script, I thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s a man&#x27;s role. That&#x27;s not for me.&#x27; Yet it was all I wanted to do. I hated every part that I had to play where I was chastising a husband or getting upset about the carpet. And I did a lot of those. Any time I could get my teeth into something, that was my flow state. That&#x27;s why I was an actor. Major Kira was like Disneyland for an actor.&quot;

==Scholarly reception==
An article in the &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis&quot; finds the character of Kira &quot;emotionally difficult&quot;. In &quot;Star Trek and Sacred Ground: Explorations of Star Trek, Religion, and American Culture&quot;, noted that Kira was not shown worshipping privately until the 1997 episode &quot;Ties of Blood and Water&quot;. Film magazine &quot;CineAction&quot; called Kira &quot;perhaps the best character&quot; in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;&#x27;s cast.

==Popular reception==
On the 25th anniversary of &quot;DS9&quot; in 2018, Daniel Holloway and Joe Otterson discussed the character at length saying, &quot;Fan reception to the character, and to the show as a whole, ran hot and cold. Previous female &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters had been helpmates—a switchboard operator (Lt. Uhura in the original series), a therapist (Counselor Troi in &quot;Next Generation&quot;), a healer (Dr. Crusher in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;). None had been a war veteran with emotional skeletons. Visitor said, &quot;Some people in the &#x27;Star Trek&#x27; world were like, &#x27;That&#x27;s not what a woman in &quot;Star Trek&quot; should be. That&#x27;s the wrong thing to be teaching. But what I saw her as was a woman of appetite and gray area—lots of gray area. Very fallible, but growing and trying. And that&#x27;s all over television now.&quot; Holloway and Otterson suggested the character was a precursor to Michael Burnham on &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; rated Kira Nerys as the fifth-best character in &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall. In 2018, &quot;TheWrap&quot; rated Kira as the tenth-best character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall, noting her role in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; noted the character&#x27;s role in the season one episode &quot;Duet&quot; which they ranked as the 7th-best episode of the series; Nana Visitor, who played Kira, praised the episode&#x27;s writing.

In 2009, IGN ranked Kira as the 11th-best character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall. In 2018, CBR ranked Kira as the 11th-best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. They elaborate that Kira in the show is not actually part of Starfleet until the last episode, in that brief time she has a big impact on the Dominion war. In 2018, &quot;TheWrap&quot; placed Kira as 10th out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the Star Trek franchise prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;Slate magazine&quot; ranked Kira Nerys one of the ten best crew characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2016, the character of Colonel Kira was ranked as the 7th-most-important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; ranked Kira one of the top 5 most likeable characters on the show.

<text>A demurrer is a pleading in a lawsuit that objects to or challenges a pleading filed by an opposing party. The word &quot;demur&quot; means &quot;to object&quot;; a &quot;demurrer&quot; is the document that makes the objection. Lawyers informally define a demurrer as a defendant saying &quot;So what?&quot; to the pleading.

Typically, the defendant in a case will demur to the complaint, but it is also possible for the plaintiff to demur to an answer. The demurrer challenges the legal sufficiency of a cause of action in a complaint or of an affirmative defense in an answer. If a cause of action in a complaint does not state a cognizable claim or if it does not state all the required elements, then the challenged cause of action or possibly the entire complaint can be dismissed at the demurrer stage as not legally sufficient. A demurrer is typically filed near the beginning of a case in response to the plaintiff filing a complaint or the defendant answering the complaint.

In common law, a demurrer was the pleading through which a defendant challenged the legal sufficiency of a complaint in criminal or civil cases. Today, however, the pleading has been discontinued in many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, the U.S. federal court system, and most U.S. states (though some states, including California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, retain it). In criminal cases, a demurrer was considered a common law due process right, to be heard and decided before the defendant was required to plead &quot;not guilty,&quot; or make any other pleading in response, without having to admit or deny any of the facts alleged.

A demurrer generally &quot;assumes&quot; the truth of all material facts alleged in the complaint, and the defendant cannot present evidence to the contrary, even if those facts appear to be obvious fabrications by the plaintiff or are likely to be easily disproved during litigation. That is, the point of the demurrer is to test whether a cause of action or affirmative defense &quot;as pleaded&quot; is legally insufficient, even if all facts pleaded are assumed to be true.

The sole exception to the no-evidence rule is that a court may take judicial notice of certain things. For example, the court can take judicial notice of commonly known facts not reasonably subject to challenge, such as the Gregorian calendar, or of public records, such as a published legislative report showing the intent of the legislature in enacting a particular statute.

==Overview==

===Civil cases===
A demurrer is commonly filed by a defendant in response to a complaint filed by the plaintiff. A demurrer to a complaint can terminate a lawsuit. Although a plaintiff may demur to a defendant&#x27;s answer to a complaint or the defendant&#x27;s affirmative defenses, a demurrer to an answer is less common because it may be a poor strategic move. A demurrer to an answer may simplify a lawsuit, but it usually will not end the lawsuit; it is normally used only when the plaintiff intends to move for summary judgment in their favor at the earliest opportunity and needs to preemptively attack some of the defendant&#x27;s affirmative defenses.

Technically, a demurrer is not a &quot;motion;&quot; a party does not file a &quot;motion for demurrer&quot; nor &quot;move the court to demur.&quot; Rather, a demurrer is a particular type of pleading and demurring is the act by which a party formally requests the court to dismiss a cause of action (claim) or the entire complaint.

In lay terms, a judge who sustains a demurrer is saying that the law does not recognize a legal claim for the facts stated by the complaining party. If the judge overrules a demurrer, the court is allowing the claim or case to proceed.

In legal terms, the demurring party asserts that the complaint or counterclaim does not amount to a legally valid claim, even if the factual allegations contained in the complaint or counterclaim are accepted as true.

Usually, a demurrer attacks a complaint as missing one or more required elements of a claim. Those elements are usually attacked by showing that the plaintiff failed to plead an essential element &quot;per se&quot; or facts that adequately support it (e.g., facts giving rise to an actionable duty running from the defendant to the plaintiff). Another method is to attack the entire cause of action itself as abolished or prohibited as against public policy (e.g., wrongful life is against public policy in most jurisdictions).

Demurrers are decided by a judge rather than a jury. The judge either grants the demurrer by sustaining it, or denies it by overruling the demurrer. If the demurrer is overruled, the defendant is ordered to file an answer within a certain period of time or else risk a default judgment. Once the answer is filed, then the case is said to be &quot;at issue&quot; (because there are now a complaint and answer on file opposing each other with the parties&#x27; respective provisions), and the case proceeds to the discovery stage.

In the alternative, a judge may sustain a demurrer with prejudice or without prejudice. With prejudice means the plaintiff cannot file another complaint attempting to fix insufficiencies of the previous complaint. If the demurrer is granted without prejudice and/or with leave to amend, then the plaintiff may correct errors filing a corrected and/or amended complaint. Demurrers sustained with prejudice are reserved for when the judge determines a plaintiff cannot cure or fix the complaint by rewriting or amending it. Depending upon the severity of the defect in a complaint, a court may sustain with prejudice on the first demurrer (very rare) or allow the plaintiff as many as three or four attempts before sustaining a demurrer to a third or fourth amended complaint with prejudice.

===Criminal cases===

In criminal cases, a demurrer may be used in some circumstances to challenge the legal sufficiency of the indictment or other similar charging instrument. Traditionally, if the defendant could admit every allegation of the indictment and still be innocent of any crime, then a &quot;general demurrer&quot; would be sustained and the indictment would be dismissed. A &quot;special demurrer&quot; refers to an attack on the form, rather than the substance, of the charge: if the defendant correctly identifies some defect &quot;on the face&quot; of the indictment, then the charges are subject to being dismissed, although usually the indictment can be redrawn (rewritten) and re-presented to the grand jury or other charging authority. While there are different ways to accomplish the goals of a special demurrer, often an alternative method to challenge the sufficiency of the indictment is an attack on the prosecution&#x27;s case prior to trial, and is generally made by means of motion to dismiss.

==England and Wales==
In civil law a demurrer as such is no longer available under the current law of England and Wales. However, two similar procedures may be employed where claims without merit need to be expeditiously dismissed .

First, an &quot;application on notice&quot; can be made for summary judgment in favor of the objecting party. Second, the court has power to strike out the Particulars of Claim.

To have a non-meritorious claim dismissed, however, the distinction between the two procedures is that when the Particulars of Claim are struck out, the claimant usually has another opportunity to file an amended Particulars of Claim, within, for example, four weeks, whereas Summary Judgment is final, though subject to appeal.

In criminal law demurrer is obsolete, although not formally abolished. It has been superseded by the more modern &quot;motion to quash&quot;, usually a verbal application to the judge to rule the indictment null and void and to stop the case. (Demurrer was pleaded in writing).

==United States==

===Federal courts===
In civil cases in the United States district courts, the demurrer was expressly abolished by Rule 7(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (&quot;FRCP&quot;, also &quot;Federal Rules&quot;) when the FRCP went into effect on September 16, 1938. The demurrer was replaced by the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

The demurrer was abolished after American lawyers realized that the pleadings should frame only those issues that will be actively litigated through motion practice once both sides have fully stated their positions and the case is at issue. Although the demurrer technically also framed the issues in a case, treating the demurrer as a pleading came to be seen as irrational because it was the &quot;only&quot; pleading that required an immediate hearing and ruling on its content (which consisted of an attack upon the complaint), while the complaint and the answer merely stated the respective positions of each side but did not require hearings in and of themselves. Thus, it made sense that a discretionary attack upon the complaint that was already being drafted, calendared, heard, and ruled upon like a motion should simply be treated like one.

Having purged the demurrer from federal courts, Rule 7(c) was deemed obsolete by the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules during the 2002–2007 FRCP revision cycle. It was therefore deleted from the version of the FRCP that went into effect on December 1, 2007.

===State courts===

A majority of U.S. states (approximately 35) have adopted civil procedure rules modeled after the Federal Rules and therefore have abolished the demurrer and replaced it with the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In Ohio, for example, demurrers are specifically prohibited.

However, a demurrer can still be filed by the defendant in a minority of U.S. state court systems. Demurrers are still used in California and Virginia state court civil practice. In California, a demurrer must assume the truth of the facts alleged by the complaining party, but challenges the complaint as a matter of law. If a demurrer is sustained regarding the form of the complaint, leave to amend is liberally granted, and denial of leave to amend may constitute an abuse of discretion. Additionally, when children are removed from their parents and taken into foster care in California, the parents may challenge the sufficiency of the dependency complaint by means of a &quot;motion akin to demurrer&quot;, which operates similarly to a demurrer. However, demurrers are prohibited in California in other family law actions. Also in California, a demurrer is not said to be &quot;granted,&quot; but is said to be &quot;sustained&quot; or &quot;overruled.&quot; An order sustaining a demurrer is not a readily appealable order unless it disposes of an entire action without leave to amend and results in a judgment.

The term &quot;preliminary objection&quot; is used in Pennsylvania state court to refer to all motions made after the filing of a complaint but before the filing of an answer; preliminary objections may be made &quot;in the nature of a demurrer&quot; (seeking to dismiss a cause of action for legal insufficiency) or &quot;in the nature of a motion to strike&quot; (seeking to remove parts of a pleading for failure to abide by the technical rules), as well as various other means. As with the traditional demurrer, preliminary objections are regarded as pleadings. Preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer are governed by Rule 1028(a)(4) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.

<text>The Tyrrell Racing Organisation was an auto racing team and Formula One constructor founded by Ken Tyrrell (1924–2001) which started racing in 1958 and started building its own cars in 1970. The team experienced its greatest success in the early 1970s, when it won three Drivers&#x27; Championships and one Constructors&#x27; Championship with Jackie Stewart. The team never reached such heights again, although it continued to win races through the 1970s and into the early 1980s, taking the final win for the Ford Cosworth DFV engine at the 1983 Detroit Grand Prix. The team was bought by British American Tobacco in 1997 and completed its final season as Tyrrell in the 1998 Formula One season. Tyrrell&#x27;s legacy continues in Formula One as the Mercedes-AMG F1 team, who is Tyrrell&#x27;s descendant through various sales and rebrandings via BAR, Honda, and Brawn GP.

==Lower formulas (1958–1967)==
Tyrrell Racing first came into being in 1958, running Formula Three cars for Ken Tyrrell and local stars. Realising he was not racing driver material, Ken Tyrrell stood down as a driver in 1959, and began to run a Formula Junior operation using the woodshed owned by his family business, Tyrrell Brothers, as a workshop. Throughout the 1960s, Tyrrell moved through the lower formulas, variously giving single seater debuts to John Surtees and Jacky Ickx. The team&#x27;s most famous partnership was the one forged with Jackie Stewart, who first signed up in 1963.

Tyrrell ran the BRM Formula Two operation throughout 1965, 1966 and 1967 whilst Stewart was signed to BRM&#x27;s Formula One team. The team then signed a deal to run F2 cars made by French company Matra. Tyrrell&#x27;s first entry into a World Championship Grand Prix was at the 1966 German Grand Prix, entering F2-spec Matra MS5s for Ickx and Hubert Hahne. Hahne finished 9th, runner-up of the F2 cars. However, Ickx was involved in a first-lap crash with the Brabham of John Taylor, who later died from burns sustained in the accident. Tyrrell later entered the 1967 German Grand Prix with an F2 car for Ickx, this time the Matra MS7. Ickx qualified with the 3rd-fastest time, however F2 cars were required to start the race from the back of the grid. He ran as high as 5th before retiring from the race with a broken suspension.

===1960s===

With the help of Elf and Ford, Tyrrell then achieved his dream of moving to Formula One in 1968 as a team principal for the team officially named Matra International, a joint-venture established between Tyrrell&#x27;s own privateer team and the French auto manufacturer Matra. Stewart was a serious contender, winning three Grands Prix in the Tyrrell-run Matra MS10. The car&#x27;s most innovative feature was the use of aviation-inspired structural fuel tanks. These allowed the chassis to be around 15 kg lighter while still being stronger than its competitors. The FIA considered the technology to be unsafe and decided to ban it for 1970, insisting on rubber bag-tanks.

For the 1969 championship, the Matra works team decided not to compete in Formula One. Matra would instead focus its efforts on Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s &#x27;Matra International&#x27; team and build a new DFV powered car with structural fuel tanks, even though it would only be eligible for a single season. Stewart won the 1969 title easily, driving the new Cosworth-powered Matra MS80 which corrected most of the weaknesses of the MS10. Stewart&#x27;s title was the first won by a French car, and the only one won by a car built in France as well as by a car entered by a privateer team. It was a spectacular achievement from the British team and the French constructor that both had only entered Formula One the previous year.

===1970s===


For the 1970 season following Matra&#x27;s merger with Simca, Tyrrell were asked by Matra to use their V12 rather than the Cosworth. Simca was a subsidiary of the American company Chrysler, a rival of Ford. 
Stewart tested the Matra V12 and found it inferior to the DFV. As a large part of the Tyrrell budget was provided by Ford, and another significant element came from French state-owned petroleum company Elf, which had an agreement with Renault that precluded supporting a Simca partner, Ken Tyrrell had little alternative but to buy a March 701 chassis as interim solution while developing his own car in secret. As a result, the name of his team Matra International was officially changed to Tyrrell Racing Organisation at the beginning of the 1970 season.

Tyrrell was still sponsored by French fuel company Elf, and Tyrrell would retain the traditional French blue racing colours for most of the rest of its existence. Tyrrell and Stewart ran the March-Fords throughout 1970 with mixed success, while Derek Gardner worked on the first in-house Tyrrell Grand Prix car at the woodshed in Ockham, Surrey.

The privateer team owned by Ken Tyrrell, which competed under the name &quot;Matra International&quot; from to and under the name &quot;Tyrrell Racing Organisation&quot; in , won 10 races in total during this period with the Matra MS10, Matra MS80 and March 701 cars as well as one World Drivers&#x27; Championship (in 1969 with the Matra MS80 car), thus becoming the most successful privateer team in Formula One history.

The Tyrrell 001, which bore much resemblance to the Matra MS80, emerged at the end of the season in the Canadian GP where Stewart achieved a pole position, making Tyrrell one of only a few constructors that achieved a pole position at the very first race. However, the car suffered mechanical failures in all of its three race starts. The nearly identical Tyrrell 003 won both Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championships in , with strong driving from Jackie Stewart and François Cevert. Stewart&#x27;s 1972 challenge was ruined by a stomach ulcer, but he returned to full fitness in 1973. He and Cevert finished first and fourth in the Championship, but Cevert was killed in practice for the final race of the season, the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. Stewart, who was to retire at the end of the season, and Tyrrell immediately stood down, effectively handing the Constructors&#x27; title to Lotus. At the end of the season Stewart made public his decision to retire, a decision that was already made before the US Grand Prix. Without their star driver or his skilled French protégé aboard, Tyrrell were never serious World Championship contenders again.

Despite this, the team remained a force throughout the 1970s, winning races with Jody Scheckter and Patrick Depailler. Most notable of these was Scheckter&#x27;s triumph at the 1976 Swedish Grand Prix, giving Tyrrell a 1–2 finish driving the distinctive Derek Gardner designed Tyrrell P34 car. The P34 was the first (and only) successful six-wheeler F1 car, which replaced the conventional front wheels with smaller wheels mounted in banks of two on either side of the car. The design was abandoned after Goodyear refused to develop the small tyres needed for the car as they were too busy fighting the other tyre manufacturers in Formula One.

Ken Tyrrell had been spending a lot of his own money running his team, but in the summer of 1979 he finally found a sponsor: Italian appliance manufacturing group Candy put up the money to run the 009, fielded by Jarier and Pironi.

===1980s===
In 1977, the Turbo era dawned in Grand Prix racing, which was, by the mid-1980s, to render normally-aspirated-engined cars obsolete. Without the proper funding, Tyrrell was the last to race with the Cosworth DFV when all other teams had switched to turbocharged engines; during the height of FISA-FOCA war, Ken Tyrrell was adamant that turbochargers constitute a form of turbine, which had been banned in 1971, a protest that was rejected by FIA stewards. It was the beginning of two decades of struggle for Tyrrell, who was often underfunded through lack of sponsorship. It seemed appropriate, then, that the final win for the classic Cosworth Ford DFV engine was taken by a Tyrrell car (the Tyrrell 011), driven by Michele Alboreto at the 1983 Detroit Grand Prix. It was also Tyrrell&#x27;s last Grand Prix win.

====1984 controversy====
At the time, the Formula One regulations specified a minimum weight which was more than achievable with non-turbocharged cars—though not with a turbocharged car due to greater complexity—leading to some cars being built light and ballasted up to the minimum weight to optimise weight distribution. However, rules then also specified that the cars were to be weighed filled with their usual fluids. In 1982, other teams (chiefly Brabham and Williams) had used this provision to develop cars with features such as &#x27;water-cooled brakes&#x27;—the car officially started the race with a large, full water tank, the water was released in the general direction of the brakes and the car ran underweight when on track and unable to be weighed, only to be later topped up sufficient water to ensure the weight limit was not breached.

As Tyrrell was the only naturally aspirated engine user in 1984 season, they were uniquely placed to be able to benefit from a similar strategy of the water brake. In Tyrrell&#x27;s case, the engine was equipped with a water injection system (a common means of lowering cylinder temperatures to increase power), whose supply tank was to be topped up late in the race. In addition, the FIA had already made provision to reduce the fuel allowance for each race during the season to 220 litres and banned the refueling of 1982–83, reducing the power available to turbocharged runners while imposing little restriction on more efficient non-turbo runners. Predictably turbo-powered teams were against this move, leaving only Tyrrell—whose engine did not need the additional fuel – in favour of it. However, F1 rules required unanimity for the change to be scrapped, leaving Tyrrell in the way.

In several races, after Tyrrell&#x27;s final pit stop, lead shot could be seen escaping from the top of the car. It turned out that Tyrrell were running the car underweight during the race then, in the closing stages, topping up water injection supply tanks with an additional two gallons of water mixed with 140 lb of lead shot to ensure it made the weight limit. As this was pumped in under significant pressure, some escaped through the tank vent and rained down on neighbouring pits, in sufficient quantities for other teams to sweep the shot away before their drivers pitted.

After the Detroit Grand Prix where Martin Brundle had finished in second for Tyrrell, the top cars were, as usual, impounded for inspection for compliance with the rules. Following this, it was alleged that the water was in fact 27.5% aromatics and constituted an additional fuel source. Tyrrell were thus charged with:
# Taking on additional fuel during the race (then illegal)
# Use of illegal fuel (the aromatic-water mix)
# Equipping the car with illegal fuel lines (the lines from the water tank to the water injection system)
# Using ballast that was incorrectly fixed to the car (the lead shot in the water tank)

As a consequence of these charges, Tyrrell were excluded from the 1984 world championship and retroactively disqualified from all races that year. Further analysis showed that the actual fuel content of the water was significantly below 1% and well within rules. Additionally, Tyrrell argued that the requirement was that the ballast had to be fixed so it required tools to remove – which they felt was the case with the shot as contained within the water tank. Tyrrell subsequently went to the FIA court of appeal. On appeal, the evidence that the water&#x27;s fuel content was in fact far lower than originally suggested was ignored, and the charges amended to:
# The fuel in the water
# Unsecured ballast
# Illegal holes in the bottom of the car, in violation of flat bottom rules designed to eliminate ground effect (eventually determined to be vents of no aerodynamic effect)

Nonetheless, the international judging panel upheld the original decision; Tyrrell were excluded from the championship – and was banned for last three races, and with them, further fines by FISA for their inability to appear in the races. With the only non-turbo team now not officially an entrant, the remaining teams had the unanimity they required to amend the rules as they wished. Tyrrell&#x27;s exclusion meant they lost all points from the 1984 season and, with them, subsidised travel benefits to the following year&#x27;s championship, a huge additional cost on top of fines for no-showing races they were banned from competing.

The ban and exclusion was seen by some observers as tantamount to manipulation by the FIA who had been looking for a way to eliminate the remaining non-turbo cars from the grid to help attract more support and sponsorship from automotive manufacturers; Tyrrell ultimately adopted a turbo Renault engine mid-way through the following season and turbocharged engines became mandatory for 1986, although naturally-aspirated engines were allowed again in 1987. The ban also allowed the turbo teams to block a proposal from FISA to reduce the fuel allowance for 1985. A further blow followed when Stefan Bellof, one of the victims of the scheme, was killed at the 1985 1000 km of Spa.

===1990s===


Tyrrell struggled on through the 1980s and 1990s – the team consistently punching above their financial weight following the 1984 controversy, despite winning the Colin Chapman Trophy for naturally-aspirated constructors in 1987 following Renault&#x27;s withdrawal that year. There was a brief revival of fortunes in the early 1990s. The combination of Harvey Postlethwaite&#x27;s revolutionary anhedral high-nose Tyrrell 019 and Jean Alesi&#x27;s full debut season in 1990 brought the team two second places at Phoenix and Monaco – Alesi having led 30 laps of the Phoenix race. The French-Sicilian left the next year for Ferrari, but Honda engines and Braun sponsorship in 1991 helped Stefano Modena earn a front row start at Monaco alongside Senna and a fine second-place finish at the 1991 Canadian Grand Prix. Nonetheless, the team slowly dropped back from the middle of the pack. Tyrrell&#x27;s last F1 points were scored by Mika Salo at the 1997 Monaco Grand Prix. 

Eventually, and in the face of dwindling form and ill health, Ken sold his team after the 1997 season to Craig Pollock, who at the same time was building British American Racing with his funding and sponsor partner British American Tobacco. Ken left the team following the sale, just before the start of the 1998 season, after a disagreement with Pollock over him choosing Ricardo Rosset for sponsorship money reasons over Jos Verstappen.

The final race for Tyrrell was the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix, where Rosset failed to qualify and teammate Tora Takagi retired on lap 28 after a collision with Esteban Tuero&#x27;s Minardi.

===Legacy===
The double championship-winning Brawn GP team of 2009 and the present Mercedes team can loosely be said to be descendants of Tyrrell, through its predecessors, Honda Racing F1 and BAR. While BAR bought the Tyrrell F1 team and entry, they used a different factory, chassis builder and engine – most of the former Tyrrell cars and equipment were sold to Paul Stoddart, later owner of the Minardi F1 team.

When team boss Ross Brawn led a management buyout of the Honda F1 team to compete in the 2009 season, a revival of the Tyrrell name was briefly considered when deciding what to call the new team.

As of the 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the teams which descended from Tyrrell have won 129 Grands Prix, 8 Drivers&#x27; championships (one as Brawn in 2009 and the rest as Mercedes from 2014 to 2020) and 9 Constructors&#x27; championships (one as Brawn in 2009 and the rest as Mercedes from 2014 to 2021).

The Minardi 2-seater F1 cars are modifications of the 1998 Tyrrell 026 design, most noticeable in the distinctive shape of the nose of the car. These cars still run in demos today, most recently as demo cars during the launch of the Yas Marina F1 track.

Ken Tyrrell died of cancer on 25 August 2001 at the age of 77.

<text>Fairies, particularly those of Irish, English, Scottish and Welsh folklore, have been classified in a variety of ways. Classifications – which most often come from scholarly analysis, and may not always accurately reflect local traditions – typically focus on behavior or physical characteristics. 

== Early classifications of fairies ==
Germanic lore featured light and dark elves (Ljósálfar and Dökkálfar). This may be roughly equivalent to later concepts such as the Seelie and Unseelie. 

In the mid-thirteenth century, Thomas of Cantimpré classified fairies into &quot;neptuni&quot; of water, &quot;incubi&quot; who wandered the earth, &quot;dusii&quot; under the earth, and &quot;spiritualia nequitie in celestibus&quot;, who inhabit the air.

In 1566, John Walsh of Devonshire – on trial for witchcraft – said that there were three kinds of &quot;feries&quot;: white, green and black.

==Good and evil==
===Seelie and Unseelie Courts===
In Scottish folklore, faeries are divided into the Seelie Court and the Unseelie Court. D. L. Ashliman notes that this may be the most famous division of fairies.

The Seelie Court is described to comprise fairies that seek help from humans, warn those who have accidentally offended them, and return human kindness with favors of their own. Still, a fairy belonging to this court would avenge insults and could be prone to mischief.

The Unseelie Court describes the darkly-inclined fairies. Unlike the Seelie Court, no offense was deemed necessary to bring down their assaults. In Scotland, they were seen as closely allied with witches.

=== In other cultures ===
In French fairy tales told by the &quot;précieuses&quot;, fairies are divided into good and evil, but the effect is literary. Many of the literary fairies seem preoccupied with the character of the humans they encounter.

Regarding Irish lore, Lady Wilde identified two groups of fairies: a gentle type fond of &quot;music and dancing,&quot; and an evil group allied with the devil. Another collector, Lady Gregory, gave a similar summary that there was a tall, playful race of sidhe, and a small, malicious race.

==Trooping and solitary==
William Butler Yeats, in &quot;Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry&quot;, divided fairies into the Trooping Fairies and the Solitary Fairies. Trooping fairies live in communities and are known for singing and dancing. They may or may not be friendly to humans. Solitary fairies, who live on their own, are more likely to be harmful. Leprechauns and banshees are solitary fairies. Katharine Mary Briggs noted that a third distinction might be needed for &quot;domesticated fairies&quot; who live in small family groups.

==Other characteristics==

=== Cornish fairies ===

Robert Hunt divided the fairies of Cornwall into five classes: the Small People; the Spriggans; the Piskies; the Buccas, Bockles, or Knockers; and the Brownies. This approach drew criticism from other scholars, such as Henry Jenner, who argued among other points that &quot;bockle&quot; and &quot;brownie&quot; were not native Cornish names. Multiple folklorists after Hunt made their own categories for Cornish fairies, but none agreed on types or number.

=== Welsh fairies ===
Wirt Sikes formally divided Welsh fairies, or Tylwyth Teg, into five general types: the Ellyllon (elves), the Bwbachod (household spirits similar to brownies and hobgoblins), the Coblynau (spirits of the mines), the Gwragedd Annwn (lake maidens), and the Gwyllion (mountain spirits resembling hags).

== Challenges of classification ==
Folklorists such as Simon Young and Ronald James have cautioned against over-categorization. Although folk belief had many names and types of supernatural beings, James pointed out that definitions were often fluid, and that trying to hold to strict definitions when working with folk informants often led to frustration and confusion. 

However, categorization serves a practical purpose. Wirt Sikes acknowledged that while such classifications are largely arbitrary and it is impossible to fully categorize fairies, &quot;the student of folklore must classify his materials distinctly in some understandable fashion, or go daft.&quot;
