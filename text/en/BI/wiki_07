<text>The Toasters are one of the original American third wave of ska bands. Founded in New York City in 1981, the band has released nine studio albums, primarily through Moon Ska Records.

==History==
Englishman Robert Hingley relocated to New York City in 1980, where he managed that city&#x27;s Forbidden Planet comic book store location. Hingley formed the Toasters in 1981 after seeing the Beat perform at the Roseland Ballroom.

The group&#x27;s first live show was supporting Bad Brains at A7 in 1981. One of the original second-wave ska bands, the early Toasters lineup included other employees of the Forbidden Planet store.

The group self-released their first single, &quot;Beat Up&quot;, in 1983. They recorded their Joe Jackson-produced debut EP, &quot;Recriminations&quot;, in 1985. After failing to find a label to release it, Hingley formed his own label Moon Ska Records.

The group collaborated further with Jackson on later albums and in live shows. Jackson had known Hingley since 1978, and appeared on some Toasters albums under the pseudonym Stanley Turpentine. Then later the group expanded with the addition of a brass section. Their first full-length album, &quot;Skaboom!&quot;, was released in 1987.

===Many members===
Hingley has been the only constant member in the band. While the band&#x27;s lineup has seen many changes, regular contributors included Coolie Ranx (vocals), Matt Malles (bass), Dave Barry (keyboards), Johnnathan McCain (drums), Freddie Reiter (saxophone), Brian Sledge (trumpet), and both Rick &quot;Chunk&quot; Faulkner and Erick &quot;E-Man&quot; Storckman on trombone. 

Veteran Jamaican saxophonist Lester Sterling has made several guest appearances, and Deejay Andrew &quot;Jack Ruby Jr.&quot; Lindo, son of Jamaican producer Jack Ruby, was also a long-time member.

Reiter joined the Toasters after playing in the New York Citizens, who had supported the Toasters on tour. Trombonist Buford O&#x27;Sullivan joined around 2000 after leaving The Scofflaws. Faulkner and Reiter went on to form the New York Ska Jazz Ensemble. The band now consists of a revolving cast of musicians, with Hingley as the central and only consistent member.

===After Moon Ska Records===

In 2004 Moon Ska Records collapsed, and Hingley has been based in Valencia, Spain. He started the Megalith label, which has since been the band&#x27;s home. The Toasters still perform around the world, and in 2007 they celebrated their 25th anniversary with a new studio album, &quot;One More Bullet&quot;. In 2011 they undertook a 30th anniversary world tour.

==Musical style==

The Toasters blend ska with pop music, rap, R&amp;B, and calypso. Their mixed-race lineup has seen them break through with both black and white audiences in the US.

==Other appearances==

The Toasters experienced a small degree of commercial success in the late 1990s due to the popularity of third wave ska in North America. Their song &quot;Two-Tone Army&quot; is the theme song for the Nickelodeon show &quot;KaBlam!&quot;. The song is performed by the &#x27;Moon Ska Stompers&#x27; - members of the Toasters and friends.

The Toasters song &quot;Skaternity&quot; was used for the end credits of &quot;KaBlam!&quot; during most of season 1, while &quot;Everything You Said Has Been A Lie&quot; was used for the end credits during seasons 2-4. Their song &quot;Don&#x27;t Let The Bastards Grind You Down&quot; appeared in the pilot episode of the animated series &quot;Mission Hill&quot;.

The Toasters have recorded background music for many TV commercials, including for America Online and Coca-Cola. Members of the Toasters performed on King Django&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Roots and Culture&quot;.

==Shows==
In 1998 the Toasters were part of the &#x27;Ska Against Racism&#x27; tour, along with the Blue Meanies, Five Iron Frenzy, and Less Than Jake.

<text>Leipzig University (), in Leipzig in Saxony, Germany, is one of the world&#x27;s oldest universities and the second-oldest university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany. The university was founded on 2 December 1409 by Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and his brother William II, Margrave of Meissen, and originally comprised the four scholastic faculties. Since its inception, the university has engaged in teaching and research for over 600 years without interruption.

Famous alumni include Angela Merkel, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Leopold von Ranke, Friedrich Nietzsche, Robert Schumann, Richard Wagner, Tycho Brahe, Georgius Agricola. The university is associated with ten Nobel laureates, most recently with Svante Pääbo who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2022.

== History ==
=== Founding and development until 1900 ===

The university was modelled on the University of Prague, from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the Jan Hus crisis and the Decree of Kutná Hora. The &quot;Alma mater Lipsiensis&quot; opened in 1409, after it had been officially chartered by Pope Alexander V in his &quot;Bull of Acknowledgment&quot; on (9 September of that year). Its first rector was Johannes Otto von Münsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. 

Like many European universities, the University of Leipzig was structured into colleges (&quot;collegia&quot;) responsible for organising accommodation and collegiate lecturing. Among the colleges of Leipzig were the Small College, the Large College, the Red College (&quot;Rotes Kolleg&quot;, also known as the New College), the college of our Lady (&quot;Frauenkolleg&quot;) and the Pauliner-College (&quot;Pauliner Kolleg&quot;). There were also private residential halls (&quot;bursen&quot;, see English &#x27;bursaries&#x27;). The colleges had jurisdiction over their members. The college structure was abandoned later and today only the names survive.

During the first centuries, the university grew slowly and was a rather regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world-class institution of higher education and research. At the end of the 19th century, important scholars such as Bernhard Windscheid (one of the fathers of the German Civil Code) and Wilhelm Ostwald (viewed as a founder of modern physical chemistry) taught at Leipzig.

Leipzig University was one of the first German universities to allow women to register as &quot;guest students&quot;. At its general assembly in 1873, the thanked the University of Leipzig and Prague for allowing women to attend as guest students. This was the year that the first woman in Germany obtained her JD, Johanna von Evreinov.

During the decline and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th and first decade of 20th century together with some other German universities Leipzig University turned into one of the centers of higher education for state administrations and elites of newly independent Balkan states (Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia) educating over 5,500 students from the region in 1859–1909 period.

Until the beginning of the Second World War, Leipzig University attracted a number of renowned scholars and later Nobel Prize laureates, including Paul Ehrlich, Felix Bloch, Werner Heisenberg and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. Many of the university&#x27;s alumni became important scientists.

=== Nazi period ===

Under Nazi rule many degrees of Jews were cancelled. Some were later reinstated as Karl-Marx University degrees by the GDR. Noteworthy Nazis, such as Max Clara (chair of anatomy) taught at the university and were appointed to positions with great authority.

The university was kept open throughout World War II, even after the destruction of its buildings. During the war the acting rector, Erich Maschke, described the continuation of the university in a memo on 11 May 1945, announcing the vote for a new rector:
By the end of the war 60 per cent of the university&#x27;s buildings and 70 per cent of its books had been destroyed.

=== The university under the German Democratic Republic ===
The university reopened after the war on 5 February 1946, but it was affected by the uniformity imposed on social institutions in the Soviet occupation zone. In 1948 the freely elected student council was disbanded and replaced by Free German Youth members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, Herbert Belter, was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The German Democratic Republic was created in 1949, and in 1953 for Karl Marx Year the university was renamed by its government the Karl Marx University, Leipzig after Karl Marx. In 1968, the partly damaged Augusteum, including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact Paulinerkirche, were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. The dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now City-Hochhaus Leipzig), built between 1968 and 1972 in the form of an open book.

=== After the reunification of Germany ===
In 1991, following the reunification of Germany, the university&#x27;s name was restored to the original Leipzig University (&quot;Alma mater lipsiensis&quot;). The reconstruction of the University Library, which was heavily damaged during the war and in the GDR barely secured, was completed in 2002.

With the delivery of the University Tower to a private user, the university was forced to spread some faculties over several locations in the city. It controversially redesigned its historical centre at the Augustusplatz. In 2002, Behet Bonzio received the second prize in the architectural competition; a first prize was not awarded by the jury. A lobby with partial support of the provincial government called for the rebuilding of St. Paul&#x27;s Church and Augusteum. This caused the resistance of the university leadership, the majority of the students and population of Leipzig. On 24 March 2004 a jury chose a design by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat, which was well received by almost all parties. He recalls the outer form of the St. Paul&#x27;s Church (today called Paulinum) and Augusteum, and abstracted the original building complex. Renovations began in the summer of 2005.

In 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide &quot;Initiative of Excellence&quot; of Germany and it was granted the graduate school &quot;BuildMoNa: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences – Building with Molecules and Nano-objects&quot;. In addition, the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the &quot;Life&quot; project – a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the &quot;Bach Archive&quot; was associated with the university. In 2009, the Leipzig University celebrated its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions, reflecting the role of the university&#x27;s research and teaching from its beginning.

== Campus ==
The university&#x27;s urban campus comprises several locations. All in all, the university is spread across 38 locations in Leipzig. The main buildings in the city center (district Mitte) are still located on the same land plots as the earliest university buildings in 1409. The university&#x27;s buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction from 2005, the new university&#x27;s main building being drafted by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euros. The new buildings were scheduled to be completed in 2009/2010, in time for the university&#x27;s 600th anniversary celebrations.

Besides the faculties and other teaching institutions, several other bodies serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.g. the Museum for Music Instruments and the Museum of Ancient Egypt) and the university hospital. The university&#x27;s Leipzig Botanical Garden, the second-oldest botanical garden in Europe. was established in 1542.
The university&#x27;s Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world&#x27;s three surviving pianos built by Bartolomeo Cristofori, the piano&#x27;s inventor. Five other Cristofori instruments are included in the museum&#x27;s collections.

It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the Leipzig University as well as the general public in the region. Its extensive historical and special collections are nationally and internationally recognized. The library consists of the main building &quot;Bibliotheca Albertina&quot; and forty branches situated near their respective academic institutions. The current stock comprises 5 million volumes and about 7,700 periodicals. Collections range from important medieval and modern manuscripts to incunabula, papyri, autographs, ostraka and coins.

The Apel Codex, a manuscript of 16th century music, is housed in the Leipzig University library, as well as the Papyrus Ebers.

The Leipzig University Library also owns parts of the Codex Sinaiticus, a Bible manuscript from the 4th century, brought from Sinai in 1843 by Constantin von Tischendorf. Papyrus Ebers is the longest and oldest surviving medical manuscript from ancient Egypt, dated to around 1600 BC. The Codex contains large parts of the Old Testament and a complete New Testament in ancient Greek, and is one of the most important known manuscripts of the Greek Old Testament and the New Testament.

<text>The Iowa Cubs are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the Chicago Cubs. They are located in Des Moines, Iowa, and are named for their Major League Baseball (MLB) affiliate. The Cubs have played their home games at Principal Park since 1992, replacing Sec Taylor Stadium which the Cubs used from 1969 to 1991.

The club was established as the Iowa Oaks of the Triple-A American Association in 1969. Iowa took on the Cubs moniker in 1982. They joined the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998 following the dissolution of the American Association after the 1997 season. In conjunction with MLB&#x27;s reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Cubs were shifted to the Triple-A East, which was renamed the International League in 2022.

The only league title in franchise history is the 1993 American Association championship.

==History==
===American Association (1969–1997)===

Triple-A Minor League Baseball came to Iowa&#x27;s capital city in 1969, as the Iowa Oaks of the American Association (AA) began play as an affiliate of the Oakland Athletics. They played their home games at Sec Taylor Stadium, which opened in 1947 and was located at the confluence of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. Many future Major League Baseball stars such as sluggers Bill McNulty, Hall of Famer Harold Baines, Pat Tabler, and 1971 Cy Young and MVP Award winning left-handed pitcher Vida Blue spent time with the Oaks. Both Bucky Dent and future Hall-of-Famer Goose Gossage played for the Oaks early in their careers. The A&#x27;s farm club experienced winning seasons in 1970 and 1971, but third and second-place finishes kept them out of the playoffs.

The Oaks became the top affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1973. They won the East Division that season with an 83–53 record, earning a spot in the best-of-seven American Association championship playoffs, but they were defeated by the Tulsa Oilers, 4–3. Manager Joe Sparks won the American Association Manager of the Year Award. Oaks pitchers tossed two no-hitters in 1974, both in away games. The first was pitched by Joe Henderson against the Wichita Aeros on July 31. The second occurred on August 25 when Butch Stinson no-hit the Indianapolis Indians.

After one season as the Houston Astros&#x27; Triple-A club in 1975, Iowa returned to the White Sox organization in 1976. Despite a number of winning seasons, they failed to qualify for the postseason during the five years of their second affiliation with Chicago. On September 1, 1977, Chris Knapp and Fred Howard combined to no-hit the Omaha Royals. On May 26, 1978, Jack Kucek tossed a no-hitter at Sec Taylor Stadium against the Oklahoma City 89ers. The franchise was awarded the 1978 John H. Johnson President&#x27;s Award, recognizing them as the &quot;complete baseball franchise—based on franchise stability, contributions to league stability, contributions to baseball in the community, and promotion of the baseball industry.&quot; Former St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa managed the Iowa Oaks in 1979 prior to becoming manager of the White Sox. Pitcher Dewey Robinson was selected for the 1979 American Association Most Valuable Pitcher Award after achieving a record of 13–7 and 9 saves with a 2.93 earned run average (ERA) and 76 strikeouts.

In 1981, the team affiliated with the Chicago Cubs. After a final season as the Oaks, they adopted the nickname of their parent team in 1982 becoming the Iowa Cubs. The name is often shortened to &quot;I-Cubs&quot; to avoid confusion with the major league team. Iowa teams of the 1980s often finished high in the standings but were unable to qualify for the championship playoffs, the only exceptions being in 1983 and 1984 when they earned spots in the semi-finals but were eliminated by Denver both years.

Members of the 1982 team garnered several league awards. Jay Howell, who struck out 139 batters on the way to a 13–4 record and a 2.36 ERA, won the AA Most Valuable Pitcher Award. Skipper Jim Napier was the league&#x27;s Manager of the Year. Outfielder Mel Hall was the Rookie of the Year after accruing a batting average of .329 while hitting 34 doubles and 32 home runs and driving in 125 runs. Another Cub outfielder, Joe Carter, won the 1983 Rookie of the Year Award after stealing 40 bases and hitting .307 with 22  homers. In 1984, Reggie Patterson fired a no-hitter against the Omaha Royals on August 21. The club was given the 1986 Larry MacPhail Award in rocognition of their marketing and promotion efforts.

Sec Taylor Stadium was demolished after the 1991 season, and a new facility of the same name, later renamed Principal Park, was constructed on the site in time for the Cubs&#x27; 1992 season.

Following a dismal 1992 campaign in which the Cubs went 51–92, they rebounded to win the 1993 Western Division title at 85–59 under manager Marv Foley. They met the Nashville Sounds in the best-of-seven championship series. Leading the series 3–1, the Cubs lost two consecutive games and were forced to a game seven. In the final game, Nashville held a 2–1 lead from the third inning to the seventh before the Cubs tied the game necessitating extra innings. An eleventh-inning walk-off home run by Iowa&#x27;s Tuffy Rhodes ended the game and gave the Cubs their first league title. Outfielder Eduardo Zambrano garnered the American Association Most Valuable Player Award after collecting 115 RBI and hitting 32 home runs with a .303 average. Iowa did not reach the playoffs again until 1997. They captured the Western Division title with a 74–69 record before defeating the New Orleans Zephyrs in the semi-finals. They were swept by the Buffalo Bisons, 3–0, in the championship round.

===Pacific Coast League (1998–2020)===

The American Association, of which the Cubs had been members since their inaugural 1969 campaign, disbanded after the 1997 season. Its teams were absorbed by the two remaining Triple-A leagues—the International League and Pacific Coast League (PCL). The Cubs joined the PCL and won the American Conference Central Division title in 1998 with an 85–59 record. In the American Conference series, they were bested by the New Orleans Zephyrs, 2–1, in a rain-shortened series. Manager Terry Kennedy won the PCL Manager of the Year Award. Former Chicago Cubs manager and Iowa native Bruce Kimm managed the I-Cubs from 2001 to 2002. He led them to the 2001 division title (83–60), but they were again eliminated by New Orleans in the conference series. The Cubs won their second John H. Johnson President&#x27;s Award in 2002.

Mike Quade, former manager of the Chicago Cubs, managed Iowa from 2003 to 2006. The Cubs ended the 2004 season at 79–64 giving them another division title. This time, they defeated the Oklahoma RedHawks, 3–2, to win the American Conference championship. In the best-of-five Pacific Coast League championship series, they lost to the Sacramento River Cats, 3–0. In 2007, catcher Geovany Soto, with a .353 average, 26 home runs, and 109 RBI, won the PCL Most Valuable Player Award. Led by PCL Manager of the Year Pat Listach, the 2008 Cubs won the American Conference Northern Division (83–59), but were beaten in the conference series by Oklahoma, 3–2.

In 2010, the team was managed by Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Ryne Sandberg who was also selected as the league&#x27;s Manager of the Year. First baseman Bryan LaHair won the 2010 PCL MVP Award with his .331 average, 38 homers, and 109 RBI. On May 7, 2014, Iowa starter Chris Rusin pitched a no-hitter against the New Orleans Zephyrs. In 2015, right-hander Carlos Pimentel won the PCL Pitcher of the Year Award after achieving a 12–6 record with 118 strikeouts and a 2.95 ERA. The Cubs returned to the postseason in 2019 having won the division with a 75–65 record, but they were eliminated by the Round Rock Express in the American Conference series. Colin Rea, who paced the league with 14 wins, was recognized as the PCL Pitcher of the Year.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, before the whole season was cancelled on June 30.

===Triple-A East / International League (2021–present)===

Following the 2020 season, Major League Baseball assumed control of Minor League Baseball in a move to increase player salaries, modernize facility standards, and reduce travel. The Chicago Cubs retained Iowa as their Triple-A affiliate, but the Pacific Coast League disbanded, and the Cubs were placed in the Triple-A East. Iowa began competition in the new league on May 4 with a 3–0 loss to the Indianapolis Indians at Principal Park. On May 9, the Cubs tossed the league&#x27;s first no-hitter when Shelby Miller, Tommy Nance, Brad Wieck, and Ryan Meisinger combined to no-hit Indianapolis, 2–0, in Des Moines. Pitchers Justin Steele, Scott Effross, and Dillon Maples threw the league&#x27;s second no-hitter in the first game of a seven-inning doubleheader against the St. Paul Saints on July 11, a 1–0 home win. Iowa ended the season in seventh place in the Midwestern Division with a 50–70 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Iowa finished the tournament in 29th place with a 1–8 record. In December 2021, owner Michael Gartner announced that the team had been sold to Endeavor. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

<text>The General Assembly is the supreme decision-making body of the Organization of American States (OAS).

The General Assembly came into being as a part of the restructuring of the OAS that took place following adoption of the Protocol of Buenos Aires (signed 27 February 1967; in force as of 12 March 1970), which contained extensive amendments to the Organization&#x27;s Charter. Prior to these changes, the OAS&#x27;s top body was the Inter-American Conference, which in turn was the successor to the International Conference of American States.

The Charter requires that the General Assembly convene once every year in a regular session. 
In special circumstances, and with the approval of two-thirds of the member states, the Permanent Council can convene special sessions.

The Organization&#x27;s member states take turns hosting the General Assembly on a rotating basis. 
The states are represented at its sessions by their chosen delegates: generally, their ministers of foreign affairs, or their appointed deputies. Each state has one vote, and most matters – except for those for which the Charter or the General Assembly&#x27;s own rules of procedure specifically require a two-thirds majority – are settled by a simple majority vote.

The General Assembly&#x27;s powers include setting the OAS&#x27;s general course and policies by means of resolutions and declarations; approving its budget and determining the contributions payable by the member states; approving the reports and previous year&#x27;s actions of the OAS&#x27;s specialized agencies; and electing members to serve on those agencies.

<doc id="340467" wikidata="Q5500154" url="?curid=340467" title="Free Will Baptist">
<text>Free Will Baptists or Free Baptists are a group of General Baptist denominations of Christianity that teach free grace, free salvation and free will. The movement can be traced to the 17th century with the development of General Baptism in England. Its formal establishment is widely linked to English theologian Thomas Helwys who led the Baptist movement to believe in general atonement. He was an advocate of religious liberty at a time when to hold to such views could be dangerous and punishable by death. He died in prison as a consequence of the religious persecution of Protestant dissenters under King James I.

In 1702, Paul Palmer would go on to establish the movement in North Carolina and in 1727 formed the Free Will Baptist Church of Chowan. Many Calvinists became Free Will Baptists in the 19th century. With the establishment of Free Will Baptists in the South, Benjamin Randall developed the movement in the Northeastern United States.

From their beginning, Free Will Baptists, in common with many groups of English Dissenters and Separatists from the Church of England, followed Brownist notions of self-governance of local churches. The notion of free will was a systematic rejection of the Puritan movement, due to its overall religious beliefs and lack of social mobility.

==History==

Free Will Baptists can be traced to General Baptists from England who settled in the American colonies in the late 17th century. The first Baptists, who originated with the ministry of Thomas Helwys near London in 1611, were General Baptists. That is, they believed that the atonement of Jesus Christ was &quot;general&quot; (for all) rather than &quot;particular&quot; (only for the elect). It shares a common history, name, and an acceptance of the Arminian doctrine.

Benjamin Laker was an English Baptist who arrived in colonial Carolina as early as 1685. Laker had been associated with Thomas Grantham, a prominent General Baptist theologian and writer, and had signed the 1663 edition of the General Baptists&#x27; Standard Confession of Faith. The earliest Free Will Baptists in America developed from English General Baptists in Carolina, who were dubbed &quot;Freewillers&quot; by their enemies and later assumed the name.

Two distinct branches of Free Will Baptists developed in America. The first and earliest was the General Baptist movement described above, known as the Palmer movement in North Carolina, from which the majority of modern-day Free Will Baptists have their origin. The later movement was the Randall movement, which arose in the late 18th century in New Hampshire. These two groups developed independently of each other.

===Palmer movement===
In 1702, a disorganized group of General Baptists in Carolina wrote a request for help to the General Baptist Association in England. Though no help was forthcoming, Paul Palmer, whose wife Johanna was the stepdaughter of Benjamin Laker, founded the first &quot;Free Will&quot; Baptist church in Chowan, North Carolina in 1727. Palmer organized at least two other churches in North Carolina. His labors, though important, were short. 

Leadership would descend to Joseph Parker, William Parker, Josiah Hart, William Sojourner and others. Joseph Parker was part of the organization of the Chowan church and ministered among the Carolina churches for over 60 years. The movement grew to over 20 churches by 1755. After 1755, missionary labors conducted by the Philadelphia Baptist Association converted most of these churches to the Particular Baptist positions of unconditional election and limited atonement. By 1770, only four churches and four ministers remained of the General Baptist persuasion. By the end of the 18th century, these churches were commonly referred to as &quot;Free Will Baptist&quot;, and this would later be referred to as the &quot;Palmer line of Free Will Baptists&quot;. The churches in the Palmer line organized various associations and conferences and organized a general conference in 1921. Many Baptists from Calvinistic Baptist backgrounds, primarily Separate Baptists, became Free Will Baptists in the 19th century.

===Randall movement===
While the movement in the South was struggling, a new movement rose in the North through the work of Benjamin Randall. Randall initially united with the Particular Baptists in 1776 but broke with them in 1779 due to their strict views on predestination. In 1780 Randall formed a &quot;Free&quot; or &quot;Freewill&quot; (Randall would combine the words &quot;free&quot; and &quot;will&quot; into a single word) Baptist church in New Durham, New Hampshire. By 1782 twelve churches had been founded, and they organized a &quot;Quarterly Meeting&quot;. In 1792 a &quot;Yearly Meeting&quot; was organized.

The &quot;Randall&quot; line split into two groups in 1835:
* The &quot;Bullockites&quot;, after founder Jeremiah Bullock (sometimes spelled &quot;Bulloch&quot; and &quot;Bullochites&quot;), which branched out to a small number of congregations in Maine and New Hampshire.
* The &quot;Buzzelites&quot;, after founder John Buzzell.
The Bullockites, mostly under the name &quot;Freewill Baptists&quot;, continued in Maine into the early 20th century, while the Buzzellites disappeared shortly after their founding.

In 1841, Randall&#x27;s Free Will Baptists merged with a similar group, the Free Communion Baptists, to form the Free Baptists.

The &quot;Randall&quot; line of Freewill Baptists grew quickly. However, in 1911, the majority of the Randall Line churches (and all the denominational property) merged with the Northern Baptist Convention. Those churches that did not merge and remained Freewill Baptist joined with other Free Will Baptists in the Southwest and Midwest to organize the Cooperative General Association of Free Will Baptists in 1916.

===Union===

Fraternal relations had existed between the Northern and Southern Free Will Baptists, but the question of slavery, and later the Civil War, prevented any formal union until the 20th century. On November 5, 1935, representatives of the General Conference (Palmer) and the Cooperative General Association (a mixture of Randall and Palmer elements west of the Mississippi) met in Nashville, Tennessee, to unite and organize the National Association of Free Will Baptists. The majority of Free Will Baptist churches organized under this umbrella, which remains the largest of the Free Will Baptist groups to this day.

==Theology and practice==
Free Will Baptist congregations believe the Bible is the very word of God and without error in all that it affirms. Free Will Baptist doctrine teaches that God desires salvation for all and sent Jesus to die for everyone. Still, Free Will Baptists believe God has given man the freedom of choice to accept or reject Christ&#x27;s sacrifice. Faith is the condition for salvation; hence, Free Will Baptists hold to conditional security. An individual is &quot;saved by faith and kept by faith.&quot; In support of this concept, some Free Will Baptists refer to the Greek word translated &quot;believeth&quot; found in John 3:16 in the King James translation. This is a continuous action verb and can thus be read, &quot;that whosoever &quot;believes and continues to believe&quot; shall not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; The concept is not of someone sinning occasionally and thus accidentally ending up &quot;not saved,&quot; but instead of someone &quot;repudiating&quot; his or her faith in Christ. Thus &quot;once saved, always saved&quot; is rejected by the denomination.

On Perseverance of the Saints from the official Treatise:
&quot;There are strong grounds to hope that the truly regenerate will persevere unto the end, and be saved, through the power of divine grace which is pledged for their support; but their future obedience and final salvation are neither determined nor certain, since through infirmity and manifold temptations they are in danger of falling; and they ought, therefore, to watch and pray lest they make shipwreck of their faith and be lost.&quot;

Free Will Baptists observe at least three ordinances: baptism, the Lord&#x27;s Supper, and the foot washing, a rite occurring among some other evangelical groups but not practiced by the majority of Baptist denominations. Free Will Baptist congregations hold differing views on eschatology, with some holding premillennial and others amillennial views. Churches advocate (voluntary) tithing, totally abstaining from alcoholic beverages, and not working on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath.

==Bodies==
The National Association of Free Will Baptists is the largest of the Free Will Baptist groups. Other major Free Will Baptist groups include:
* Original Free Will Baptist Convention – a North Carolina–based body of Free Will Baptists that was organized in 1913 and initially joined the National Association of Free Will Baptists but split in 1961 due to some inner differences. The Convention comprised the majority of North Carolina–based Free Will Baptist churches, though a minority split from the North Carolina state convention and maintain affiliation with the National Association. The Convention maintains mission activity in eight countries: Philippines, Mexico, Bulgaria, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Liberia, and Guinea.
* United American Free Will Baptist Church – the largest body of African-American Free Will Baptist churches, organized in 1901 and headquartered in Kinston, North Carolina.
* United American Free Will Baptist Conference – a body of African-American Free Will Baptist churches that withdrew from the &quot;United American Free Will Baptist Church&quot; in 1968; headquartered in Lakeland, Florida.
* Old Original Free Will Baptist Conference, an episcopal African-American association with six churches, centered in North Carolina.
* Evangelical Free Baptist Church – based in Illinois. In 1987, it had 22 churches and 2,500 members.
* Unaffiliated Free Will Baptist local associations – a number of local Free Will Baptist associations remain independent of the National Association, Original FWB Convention, and the two United American bodies. Researchers have identified 10 such associations, though there may be more. The unaffiliated associations of Free Will Baptists include over 300 churches with an estimated 22,000 members. They have no organization beyond the &quot;local&quot; level.
* Pentecostal Free Will Baptist Church, a Free Will Baptist denomination that accepts Holiness Pentecostal doctrine, chiefly a second work of grace (entire sanctification) and a third work of grace (Spirit baptism evidenced by speaking in tongues); it has around 150 congregations.

<doc id="340469" wikidata="Q1558418" url="?curid=340469" title="2000 Japanese general election">
<text>General elections were held in Japan on 25 June 2000 to elect the 480 members of the House of Representatives.

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) remained the largest party in the House of Representatives but lost seats, along with its two coalition partners. Two cabinet members, Takashi Fukaya and Tokuichiro Tamazawa, lost their seats. The Democratic Party made major gains under the leadership of Yukio Hatoyama.

==Background==
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi suffered a stroke in April 2000 and was replaced by Yoshiro Mori. Although the term limit for the House of Representatives would have been reached in October 2000, Mori dissolved the House on June 2 in what became popularly known as the due to a controversial statement by Mori prior to the election, which preceded a slump in government approval ratings from 40% to 20%. The LDP government advocated continued public works spending while the opposition advocated less spending and more governmental reforms.

The Social Democratic Party left the coalition in 1998 and re-join the opposition after years of coalition with the ideologically contrasting LDP.

Meanwhile, the Komeito Party, a centrist party with roots from the Soka Gakkai based on the Nichiren Buddhist movement and despite almost decades of opposition against the LDP, shifted from centre towards conservatism. An electoral alliance between the once rivals of the Komeito and the LDP has been in effect since the Japanese General election in 2000. For the LDP, despite not being able to win an absolute majority of votes by itself in further elections (especially for the House of Councillors which the LDP lost majority since 1989), the Komeito party has been counted on since then to ensure a stable governing majority rule.

==Results==

The House of Representatives consisted of 480 members, 300 elected from single-member constituencies and 180 elected on a proportional basis from eleven multi-member constituencies known as Block constituencies.

=== By prefecture ===
=== By PR block ===
== Analysis ==
The further entrenchment of the 1955 System continued, with the Democratic Party of Japan replacing the New Frontier Party as the primary opposition to the LDP. The Social Democratic Party saw a brief resurgence following its near destruction in 1996, but the decline of the party would continue in the following election. The election set the groundwork for the system of politics that would lay how Japanese elections work until the collapse of the Democratic Party of Japan in the mid-2010s.

<doc id="340471" wikidata="Q841184" url="?curid=340471" title="Roman salute">
<text>The Roman salute, also known in modern times as the Fascist salute, is a gesture in which the right arm is fully extended, facing forward, with palm down and fingers touching. In some versions, the arm is raised upward at an angle; in others, it is held out parallel to the ground. In contemporary times, the former is commonly considered a symbol of fascism. According to an apocryphal legend, the fascist gesture was based on a customary greeting which was claimed to be used in ancient Rome. However, no Roman text describes such a gesture, and the Roman works of art that display salutational gestures bear little resemblance to the modern &quot;Roman&quot; salute.

Originating from Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s painting &quot;The Oath of the Horatii&quot; (1784), the gesture quickly developed a historically inaccurate association with Roman republican and imperial culture. The gesture and its identification with Roman culture were further developed in other neoclassic artworks. In the United States, a similar salute for the Pledge of Allegiance known as the Bellamy salute was created by Francis Bellamy in 1892. The gesture was further elaborated upon in popular culture during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in plays and films that portrayed the salute as an ancient Roman custom. These included the 1914 Italian film &quot;Cabiria&quot; whose intertitles were written by the nationalist poet Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio. In 1919, d&#x27;Annunzio adopted the cinematographically depicted salute as a neo-imperial ritual when he led an occupation of Fiume.

Through d&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s influence, the gesture soon became part of the rising Italian Fascist movement&#x27;s symbolic repertoire. In 1923, the salute was gradually adopted by the Italian Fascist regime. It was then adopted as the Nazi salute and made compulsory within the Nazi Party in 1926 and gained national prominence in the German state when the Nazis took power in 1933. It was also adopted by other fascist, far right, and ultranationalist movements.

Since the end of World War II, displaying the Nazi variant of the salute has been a criminal offence in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. Legal restrictions on its use in Italy are more nuanced and use there has generated controversy. The gesture and its variations continue to be used in neo-fascist, neo-Nazi, and Falangist contexts.

==Ancient Roman greeting gestures==

The modern gesture consists of stiffly extending the right arm frontally and raising it roughly 135 degrees from the body&#x27;s vertical axis, with the palm of the hand facing down and the fingers stretched out and touching each other. According to a pseudo-historical legend, this salute was based on an ancient Roman custom. However, this description is not found in Roman literature and is never mentioned by ancient Roman historians. Not a single Roman work of art displays a salute of this kind. The gesture of the raised right arm or hand in Roman and other ancient cultures that does exist in surviving literature and art generally had a significantly different function and is never identical with the modern straight-arm salute.

The right hand (Lat. &quot;dextera&quot;, &quot;dextra&quot;; Gr. δεξιά – &quot;dexia&quot;) was commonly used in antiquity in gestures symbolic of a pledge of trust, friendship, or loyalty. For example, Cicero reported that Octavian pledged an oath to Julius Caesar while outstretching his right hand: &quot;Although that youth [the young Caesar Octavian] is powerful and has told Antony off nicely: yet, after all, we must wait to see the end. But what a speech! He swore his oath with the words: &#x27;so may I achieve the honours of my father!&#x27;, and at the same time he stretched out his right hand in the direction of his statue.&quot;
Sculptures commemorating military victories such as those on the Arch of Titus, the Arch of Constantine, or on the Column of Trajan are the best-known examples of raised arms in the art of that period. However, these monuments do not display a single representation of the Roman salute.

The images closest in appearance to a raised arm salute are scenes in Roman sculpture and coins which show an &quot;adlocutio&quot;, &quot;acclamatio&quot;, &quot;adventus&quot;, or &quot;profectio&quot;. These are occasions when a high-ranking official, such as a general or the emperor, addresses individuals or a group, often soldiers. Unlike modern custom, in which both the leader and the people he addresses raise their arms, most of these scenes show only the senior official raising his hand. Occasionally it is a sign of greeting or benevolence, but usually it is used as an indication of power. An opposite depiction is the &quot;salutatio&quot; of a &quot;diogmites&quot;, a military police officer, who raises his right arm to greet his commander during his &quot;adventus&quot; on a relief from 2nd-century Ephesus.

An example of a salutational gesture of imperial power can be seen in the statue of Augustus of Prima Porta which follows certain guidelines set out by oratory scholars of his day. In &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot; the anonymous author states that the orator &quot;will control himself in the entire frame of his body and in the manly angle of his flanks, with the extension of the arm in the impassioned moments of speech, and by drawing in the arm in relaxed moods&quot;. Quintilian states in his &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;: &quot;Experts do not permit the hand to be raised above the level of the eyes or lowered beneath the breast; to such a degree is this true that it is considered a fault to direct the hand above the head or lower it to the lower part of the belly. It may be extended to the left within the limits of the shoulder, but beyond that it is not fitting.&quot;

== Modern invention of the salute ==

=== 18th–19th centuries France ===

Beginning with Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s painting &quot;The Oath of the Horatii&quot; (1784), an association of the gesture with Roman republican and imperial culture emerged. The painting shows the three sons of Horatius swear on their swords, held by their father, that they will defend Rome to the death. It is based on a historical event described by Livy (Book I, sections 24-6) and elaborated by Dionysius in &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot; (Book III). However, the moment depicted in David&#x27;s painting is his own creation. Neither Livy nor Dionysius mention any oath taking episode. Dionysius, the more detailed source, reports that the father had left to his sons the decision to fight then raised his hands to the heavens to thank the gods.

Dominating the center of &quot;The Oath of the Horatii&quot; is the brothers&#x27; father, facing left. He has both hands raised. His left hand is holding three swords, while his right hand is empty, with fingers stretched but not touching. The brother closest to the viewer is holding his arm almost horizontally. The brother on the left is holding his arm slightly higher, while the third brother holds his hand higher still. While the first brother extends his right arm, the other two are extending their &quot;left&quot; arms. The succession of arms raised progressively higher leads to a gesture closely approximating the style used by fascists in the 20th century in Italy, albeit with the &quot;wrong&quot; arms.

Art historian Albert Boime provides the following analysis:

After the French Revolution of 1789, David was commissioned to depict the formation of the revolutionary government in a similar style. In the &quot;Tennis Court Oath&quot; (1792) the National Assembly are all depicted with their arms outstretched, united in an upward gesture comparable to that of the Horatii, as they swear to create a new constitution. The painting was never finished, but an immense drawing was exhibited in 1791 alongside the &quot;Oath of the Horatii&quot;. As in the &quot;Oath of the Horatii&quot;, David conveys the unity of minds and bodies in the service of the patriotic ideal. But in this drawing, he takes the subject further, uniting the people beyond just family ties and across different classes, religions, and philosophical opinions.

After the republican government was replaced by Napoleon&#x27;s imperial régime, David further deployed the gesture in &quot;The Distribution of the Eagle Standards&quot; (1810). But unlike his previous paintings representing republican ideals, in &quot;Eagle Standards&quot; the oath of allegiance is pledged to a central authority figure, and in imperial fashion. Boime sees the series of oath pictures as &quot;the coding of key developments in the history of the Revolution and its culmination in Napoleonic authoritarianism&quot;.

The imperial oath is seen in other paintings, such as Jean-Léon Gérôme&#x27;s &quot;Ave Caesar! Morituri te salutant (Hail, Caesar, those who are about to die salute you)&quot; of 1859. In this painting, the gladiators are all raising their right or left arms, holding tridents and other weapons. Their salutation is a well-known Latin phrase quoted in Suetonius, &quot;De Vita Caesarum&quot; (&quot;The Life of the Caesars&quot;, or &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;). Despite becoming widely popularised in later times, the phrase is unknown in Roman history aside from this isolated use, and it is questionable whether it was ever a customary salute, as is often believed. It was more likely to be an isolated appeal by desperate captives and criminals condemned to die.

=== 19th–20th centuries United States ===

On October 12, 1892, the Bellamy salute was demonstrated as the hand gesture to accompany the Pledge of Allegiance in the United States. The inventor of the saluting gesture was James B. Upham, junior partner and editor of &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot;. Bellamy recalled Upham, upon reading the pledge, came into the posture of the salute, snapped his heels together, and said &quot;Now up there is the flag; I come to salute; as I say &#x27;I pledge allegiance to my flag,&#x27; I stretch out my right hand and keep it raised while I say the stirring words that follow.&quot;

As fascism took hold in Europe, controversy grew over the use of the Bellamy salute given its similarity to the Roman Salute. When war broke out in 1939, the controversy intensified. School boards around the country revised the salute to avoid the similarity. There was a counter-backlash from the United States Flag Association and the Daughters of the American Revolution, who felt it inappropriate for Americans to have to change the traditional salute because others had later adopted a similar gesture.

On June 22, 1942, at the urging of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Congress passed , which codified the etiquette used to display and pledge allegiance to the flag. This included use of the Bellamy salute, specifically that the pledge &quot;be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart; extending the right hand, palm upward, toward the flag at the words &#x27;to the flag&#x27; and holding this position until the end, when the hand drops to the side.&quot; Congress did not discuss or take into account the controversy over use of the salute. Congress later amended the code on December 22, 1942, when it passed . Among other changes, it eliminated the Bellamy salute and replaced it with the stipulation that the pledge &quot;be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart.&quot;

=== Early 20th century in theatre and film ===

The gesture, already established in the United States through the Bellamy salute, has been traced to the Broadway production of the play &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. The play, based on Lew Wallace&#x27;s book &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot;, opened on Broadway in November 1899 and proved to be a great success. Photographs show several scenes using the gesture, including one of Ben-Hur greeting a seated sheik and another of a small crowd so greeting Ben-Hur in his chariot. Neither Wallace&#x27;s novel nor text for the theatrical production mentions a raised arm salute. The salute was evidently added in keeping with the exaggerated style of acting in 19th century theater, which in turn influenced acting in the silent cinema.

The salute frequently occurs in early 20th century films set in antiquity, such as the American &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1907) and the Italian &quot;Nerone&quot; (1908), although such films do not yet standardize it or make it exclusively Roman. In &quot;Spartaco&quot; (1914), even the slave Spartacus uses it. Later examples appear in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1925) and in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot; (1932) and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1934), although the execution of the gesture is still variable.

Of special note is the use in Giovanni Pastrone&#x27;s colossal epic &quot;Cabiria&quot; (1914). Its intertitles, character names, and movie title were attributed to Italian nationalist Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio, who was known as the &quot;poet-warrior&quot;. Inspired by the Italo-Turkish War, in which Italy conquered the North African Ottoman province of Tripolitania, Pastrone pursued a politically volatile issue. The film highlights Italy&#x27;s Roman past and the &quot;monstrous&quot; nature of Carthaginian society, which is contrasted with the &quot;nobility&quot; of Roman society. &quot;Cabiria&quot; was one of several films of the period that &quot;helped resuscitate a distant history that legitimized Italy&#x27;s past and inspired its dreams&quot; and which &quot;delivered the spirit for conquest that seemed to arrive from the distant past&quot;, thereby presaging the &quot;political rituals of fascism&quot;, &quot;thanks ... to its prime supporter and apostle, Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio.&quot;

Variations on the salute occur throughout &quot;Cabiria&quot; on the part of Romans and Africans. Scipio uses the gesture once. Fulvius Axilla, the story&#x27;s fictitious hero, twice employs it as a farewell greeting to his hosts. The Numidian king Massinissa, guest of the Carthaginian Hasdrubal, raises his right hand and is so greeted in return, once by the strongman Maciste. Princess Sophonisba and King Syphax mutually greet each other by raising their hands and declining their bodies. The diversity of the gesture and the variety of nationalities who use it in &quot;Cabria&quot; is seen as further evidence that the salute is a modern invention, used in the film to highlight the exotic nature of antiquity.

==Adoption by fascist movements==

=== Fascist Italy ===
Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, who had written the subtitles for &quot;Cabiria&quot;, appropriated the salute when he occupied Fiume in 1919 and led the &quot;Italian Regency of Carnaro&quot;. D&#x27;Annunzio has been described as the John the Baptist of Italian Fascism, having invented many of the theatrical rituals, including the salute and the balcony address, that became part of the movement&#x27;s symbolic repertoire . On January 31, 1923, the Ministry of Education instituted a ritual honoring the flag in schools using the Roman salute.

In 1925, as Mussolini began his fascitization of the state, the salute was gradually adopted by the regime, and by December 1, 1925, all state civil administrators were required to use it.

Achille Starace, the Italian Fascist Party secretary, pushed for measures to make the use of the Roman salute generally compulsory, denouncing hand shaking as bourgeois. He further extolled the salute as &quot;more hygienic, more aesthetic, and shorter.&quot; He also suggested that the Roman salute did not imply the necessity of taking off the hat unless one was indoors. By 1932, the salute was adopted as the substitute for the handshake. On August 19, 1933, the military was ordered to use the salute whenever an unarmed detachment of soldiers was called on to render military honors for the King or Mussolini.

The symbolic value of the gesture grew, and it was felt that the proper salute &quot;had the effect of showing the fascist man&#x27;s decisive spirit, which was close to that of ancient Rome&quot;. The salute was seen to demonstrate the fascist&#x27;s &quot;decisive spirit, firmness, seriousness, and acknowledgment and acceptance of the regime&#x27;s hierarchical structure&quot;. It was further felt that the correct physical gesture brought forth a change in character. A joke claimed, however, that the Fascist salute used one hand because Italians were tired of raising both hands to surrender during World War I.

The handshake was supposed to disappear from the view of Italians and not contaminate their daily life. In 1938, the party abolished handshaking in films and theater, and on November 21, 1938, the Ministry of Popular Culture issued orders banning the publishing of photographs showing people shaking hands. Even official photographs of visiting dignitaries were retouched to remove the image of their handshaking.

=== Nazi Germany ===

In Germany, the salute, sporadically used by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) since 1923, was made compulsory within the movement in 1926. Called the Hitler salute (&quot;Hitlergruß&quot;), it functioned both as an expression of commitment within the party and as a demonstrative statement to the outside world. Yet in spite of this demand for the outward display of obedience, the drive to gain acceptance did not go unchallenged, even within the movement. Early objections focused on its resemblance to the Roman salute employed by Fascist Italy, and hence on it not being German. In response, efforts were made to establish its pedigree and invent a proper tradition after the fact.

The compulsory use of the Hitler salute for all public employees followed a directive issued by Reich Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick on July 13, 1933, one day before the ban on all non-Nazi parties. The Wehrmacht refused to adopt the Hitler salute and was able for a time to maintain its own customs. The military were required to use the Hitler salute only while singing the Horst Wessel Lied and German national anthem, and in non-military encounters such as greeting members of the civilian government. Only after the July 20 Plot in 1944 were the military forces of the Third Reich ordered to replace the standard military salute with the Hitler salute.



=== Elsewhere ===
Similar forms of salutes were adopted by various groups. Its use in France dates back to the revolution. It will be used also by the &quot;Jeunesses Patriotes (Patriotic Youth)&quot;, a movement led by Pierre Taittinger, would give the fascist salute at meetings while shouting &quot;Dictatorship!&quot;. Marcel Bucard&#x27;s &quot;Mouvement Franciste,&quot; founded in September 1933, adopted the salute as well as donning blue shirts and blue berets. &quot;Solidarité Française&quot; used the salute as well, though its leaders denied the movement was fascist. By 1937, rivalry amongst French right wing parties sometimes caused confusion over salutes. The Parti Populaire Français, generally regarded as the most pro-Nazi of France&#x27;s collaborationist parties, adopted a variant of the salute that distinguished itself from others by slightly bending the hand and holding it at face level.

In the early 1930s, the salute was used by members of the Estonian nationalist right wing Vaps Movement, as well as the Brazilian Integralist Action, who used to salute by raising one arm. The Brazilian form of the Salute was called &quot;Anauê&quot; – a word used as a salutation and as a cry by the Brazilian indigenous Tupi people, meaning &quot;you are my brother&quot;.

In Greece in 1936, when Ioannis Metaxas and his 4th of August Regime took power, an almost identical salute was adopted – first by the National Youth Organization and later by the government as well as common people – and used even while fighting against Italy and Germany in WW2.

In Spain, in the early 1930s, CEDA, the &quot;Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas&quot; (&quot;Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups&quot;) adopted a form of the Roman salute. Then, on April 26, 1937, after General Francisco Franco took over the fascist &quot;Falange Española de las JONS&quot; party and merged it with the Carlist, monarchist, and ultracatholic Traditionalist Communion, creating the FET y de las JONS (&quot;Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista&quot;, lit. &#x27;Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx of the Councils of the National Syndicalist Offensive&quot;), he formally approved the salute in a decree which made it the official salutation to be used by all except the military, who would continue to use the traditional military salutes. This was repealed in September 1945. When the Franco regime restored &quot;Marcha Real&quot; as the Spanish national anthem in 1942 and established unofficial new lyrics for it, the first stanza referred to the fascist salute: &quot;Alzad los brazos, hijos del pueblo español&quot; (&quot;Raise your arms, sons of the Spanish people&quot;). These lyrics remained part of the Spanish national anthem until 1978.

After a meeting with Mussolini, in December 1937, Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović and chairman of Yugoslav Radical Union adopted a version of the salute as he took to styling himself as &quot;Vođa (Leader)&quot;.

On January 4, 1939, the salute by raising one arm was adopted in Romania under a statute promulgating the National Renaissance Front. In Slovakia, the Hlinka Guard&#x27;s &quot;Na stráž!&quot; (On guard!) consisted of a half-hearted compromise between a friendly wave and a salute with a straight raised arm.

During the Vichy regime in France, the Roman salute was regularly used by members of the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism and the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne. It was also used by certain collaborationist groups (such as the National Popular Rally) during public events organised by the regime. Pupils of the &quot;Chantiers de la jeunesse française&quot;, a pro-Vichy youth movement, also used the Roman salute.

==Post World War II==

===Italy===
The salute has been used many times by prominent individuals as well as groups of people since the war. Famed poet Ezra Pound used the salute in praise of his adopted country of Italy when he returned in 1958 after being released from an insane asylum in the United States. The salute was on display in the 1968 funeral for Mussolini&#x27;s youngest daughter, Anna Maria Mussolini Negri. When the Italian Social Movement had its greatest electoral gains since the Second World War in June 1971, crowds at the party headquarters cheered and gave the outstretched arm salute. On July 29, 1983, on the 100th anniversary of Mussolini&#x27;s birth, thousands of black-shirted supporters chanted &quot;Duce! Duce!&quot; with their arms raised in the fascist salute on a march from his native village of Predappio in Romagna to the cemetery where he was buried. On the eve of Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s election victory in 1994, young supporters of Gianfranco Fini made the fascist salute while chanting &quot;Duce! Duce!&quot;

In 2005, Italian footballer Paolo Di Canio created controversy by twice using the gesture to salute S.S. Lazio fans, first in a match against archrivals A.S. Roma and then against A.S. Livorno Calcio (a club inclined to leftist politics). Di Canio received a one match game ban after the second event and was fined 7,000 euros, after which he was quoted as saying &quot;I will always salute as I did because it gives me a sense of belonging to my people [...] I saluted my people with what for me is a sign of belonging to a group that holds true values, values of civility against the standardisation that this society imposes upon us.&quot; His salute featured on unofficial merchandise sold outside Stadio Olimpico after the ban. Di Canio has also expressed admiration for Mussolini.

In June 2009, Michela Vittoria Brambilla, an Italian politician and businesswoman commonly described as a possible successor to Silvio Berlusconi for leadership of the Italian right, was caught in a controversy over her alleged use of the Roman salute, with calls for her to step down. She denied the accusation, stating &quot;I&#x27;ve never either done or thought of doing any gesture that is an apology of fascism, something toward which I&#x27;ve never showed any indulgence, let alone sympathy. And why should I have made a public display of such a despicable gesture shortly after I&#x27;ve been made a minister?&quot; A video of the event was posted on the Web site of the newspaper &quot;La Repubblica&quot; that showed Brambilla extending her right arm upward in what appears to be a fascist salute. Brambilla said she was just greeting the crowd.

In January 2024, hundreds of neo-fascists gathered at the MSI&#x27;s former headquarters to commemorate the Acca Larentia killings. They performed fascist salutes and shouted: &quot;&quot;&quot;, present!&quot; They also did a typical rallying cry at neo-fascist events: &quot;For all fallen comrades!&quot; This prompted criticism from the opposition and outrage. Marco Vizzardelli, a theatre-goer who was quickly identified by DIGOS for shouting &quot;Long live anti-fascist Italy!&quot; at La Scala, said that he was &quot;outraged&quot;, adding: &quot;Nobody stopped them, double standards.&quot; Fabio Rampelli of Brothers of Italy (FdI), an MSI-heir party that also commemorates the victims, said that these were loose cannons and that FdI had nothing to do with it. Opposition leaders, such as Elly Schlein, asked Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy and FdI member, to apply the ban of neo-fascist groups that is part of the Italian Constitution, which far-right groups are able to circumvent by using a different name and proclaiming themselves to be new political forces. Others also urged Meloni and Lazio president Francesco Rocca to distance themselves.

In June 2024, &quot;Fanpage.it&quot; released an undercover report on the activities of &quot;Gioventù Nazionale&quot;, youth wing of the right-wing political party Brothers of Italy. The investigation captured members of National Youth engaging in chanting slogans, singing songs, and making the salute associated with fascism. These behaviors were said to be encouraged privately within the group but discouraged publicly to avoid media scrutiny. Eric Mamer, spokesperson for European Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen, criticized the use of fascist symbols by the organization. Opposition figures like Elly Schlein and Nicola Fratoianni condemned National Youth&#x27;s actions and called on Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni for clarification while right-wing politician Italo Bocchino defended them and dismissed Fanpage&#x27;s investigation as &quot;garbage&quot;.

===Germany===
Use of the salute and accompanying phrases has been forbidden by law in Germany since the end of World War II. Section 86a of the German Penal Code provides for punishment of up to three years in prison for anyone using the salute, unless it is used for artistic, scientific, or educational purposes.

===Greece===
The Greek nationalist party Golden Dawn used the Roman salute unofficially. Golden Dawn was accused by its opponents of being neo-Nazi, but the party denies this and claims that the salute was ancient Greek or Roman, and that it was used as a tribute to Ioannis Metaxas and his 4th of August Regime which led Greece against the foreign occupation forces in WWII.

===Syria and Lebanon===

The salute employed by groups associated with Ba&#x27;athism, Pan-Arabism and Phalangism supporters, including Hezbollah, the pro-Assad NDF and Assad supporters, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, and the Kataeb Party. However, the oath of allegiance by the Lebanese army and the salute to the flag both use the Roman salute – possibly due to Vichy France&#x27;s influence shortly before independence was officially gained in 1943 – even to this day.

===Mexico=== 
In Mexico, the Roman salute is used today during the Pledge of Allegiance to the Mexican Flag in official, military, and civilian ceremonies. It is a deeply rooted tradition symbolizing respect and loyalty to the nation.
The President of Mexico performs this salute during the oath of office, a practice that emphasizes the symbolic connection between the leader and the state. Similarly, politicians often use this salute during the inauguration of official events, further cementing its ceremonial significance.
In military contexts, the salute is a standard gesture during events honoring the flag and the country, reflecting discipline and unity.
The civilian use of the salute is most prominent in educational institutions, where it is mandatory in public schools up to High school during weekly Monday ceremonies and on significant national holidays, such as Independence Day and Revolution Day. While private schools are not legally required to perform these ceremonies, many follow the tradition, reinforcing the cultural significance of these practices.

===Portugal===
In Portugal the salute is still used today by the military to take their oath to the national flag, when they successfully complete the first phase of military instruction. Formed in front of the highest symbol of national sovereignty, the military raise their right arm pointed towards the flag and take their oath.

===South Africa===
The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, a neo-Nazi political party and paramilitary force known for its advocacy of an all-white Afrikaner &quot;Volkstaat&quot;, has used Nazi-style uniforms, flags, insignia, and salutes at meetings and public rallies. Hundreds of supporters in 2010 delivered straight-arm salutes outside the funeral for its founder and former leader Eugène Terre&#x27;Blanche, who was murdered by two black farm workers over an alleged wage dispute.

===Taiwan===
The Taiwanese oath of office is performed by raising a fully extended right arm with palm down and fingers touching towards the national flag and a picture of Sun Yat-sen.

===Red Hand of Ulster Salute===
The Red Hand of Ulster Salute is a modified version of the Roman Salute in which the hand is raised vertically to symbolise the Red Hand of Ulster. It is used by some Rangers F.C. fans to show an affinity with the Loyalist cause. Its similarity to the Nazi salute has caused offence and the football club and its supporters&#x27; association have asked them not to use it.

==In popular culture==
A large number of films made after World War II made the Roman salute a visual stereotype of a proto-fascist ancient Roman society. In the 1951 film &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, Nero&#x27;s repeated use of the salute at mass rallies explicitly presents the Roman Empire as a fascist military state. The movie provided other filmmakers of the time a model, with notable examples including &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, and &quot;Caligula&quot;. Not until &quot;Gladiator&quot; did the Roman epic return to the cinema. In this movie, the salute is notably absent in most scenes, for example when Commodus enters Rome or when the Senate salutes the Emperor by head-bowing.

Variations on the salute also appear in neo-fascist contexts. For example, The Christian Falangist Party, founded in 1985, uses a &quot;pectoral salute&quot;, in which the right arm, bent at the elbow, is extended from the heart, palm down. This gesture was used in François Truffaut&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;. The film portrays a futuristic totalitarian society modeled after the fascist state, including black uniforms, book burnings, and thought control. In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, the salute begins with the right fist being placed over the heart, as in a pectoral salute, and then the arm is stretched out (usually up) before the body, open palm down, as in a traditional Roman salute. In the episode, Captain Kirk and members of his crew are transported to a parallel universe in which the United Federation of Planets has been replaced by an empire characterized by sadistic violence and torture, genocide, and unquestioning obedience to authority. A modified Roman salute is commonly used in the British-American series &quot;Rome&quot;. Here the salute avoids similarity to the Fascist salute, as the series seeks not to depict these Romans as stereotypical conquerors. Therefore, the salute is not the familiar straight arm salute but rather resembles a pectoral salute, with the right hand placed over the heart and then extended to the front of the body.

<text>The National Association of Free Will Baptists (NAFWB) is a national body of Free Will Baptist churches in the United States and Canada, organized on November 5, 1935 in Nashville, Tennessee. The Association traces its history in the United States through two different lines: one beginning in the South in 1727 (the &quot;Palmer line&quot;) and another in the North in 1780 (the &quot;Randall line&quot;). The &quot;Palmer line,&quot; however, never developed as a formal denomination. It consisted of only about three churches in North Carolina. The NAFWB is the largest of the Free Will Baptist denominations.

==History==
In 1702, English General Baptists who had settled in the Province of Carolina requested help from the General Baptists in England. Though they did not receive the requested assistance, native Paul Palmer labored there about 25 years later, and founded the first &quot;General&quot; or &quot;Free Will&quot; Baptist church in Chowan County, North Carolina, in 1727. (Many General Baptists held to general atonement but &quot;personal predestination&quot; or eternal security.) Palmer organized at least three churches in North Carolina. From one church in 1727, the fellowship grew to over 20 churches by 1755. After 1755, the churches began to decrease and many churches and members became Particular Baptists. By 1770, only four churches and four ministers remained of the General Baptist persuasion. By the end of the 18th century, these churches were being referred to as &quot;Free Will Baptist.&quot; The churches in the &quot;Palmer&quot; line would again experience growth slowly in the 19th century. They organized various associations and conferences, and finally organized into the &quot;General Conference of Free Will Baptists&quot; in 1921. The problem with the history of Paul Palmer, however, stems from the fact that it is uncertain exactly what view of perseverance he actually held. In fact, some church historians think he was Calvinistic in his views. He had come from the Welsh Tract Church, which was openly Calvinistic.

Another &quot;Free Will&quot; movement rose in the North through the work of Benjamin Randall (1749–1808). Randall united with the Regular Baptists in 1776, but broke with them in 1779 due to his more liberal views on predestination. In 1780, Randall formed a &quot;Free&quot; Baptist church in New Durham, New Hampshire. More churches were founded, and in 1792 a Yearly Meeting was organized. This northern line of Free Will Baptists expanded rapidly, but the majority of the churches merged with the Northern Baptist Convention in 1911. A remnant of the Randall churches organized in 1917 as the &quot;Cooperative General Association of Free Will Baptists&quot;.

Representatives of the &quot;Palmer&quot; (General Conference) and &quot;Randall&quot; (Cooperative General Association) groups of Free Will Baptists met at Cofer&#x27;s Chapel in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1935 and organized the &quot;National Association of Free Will Baptists&quot; as a merger of the two groups. The new association adopted the Treatise on the Faith and Practice of the Free Will Baptists, which has been revised several times since then. As of August 2005, the Association claims to have over 2,400 churches in 42 states and 14 foreign countries. The NAFWB is actively involved in missionary work in the United States and throughout the world. The Association operates a publishing arm called Randall House. Three colleges, Welch College (formerly the Free Will Baptist Bible College) in Nashville; Randall University (formerly known as Hillsdale Free Will Baptist College) in Moore, Oklahoma; and Southeastern Free Will Baptist College in Wendell, North Carolina are affiliated with the Association. The NAFWB offices are presently maintained in Antioch, Tennessee, a neighborhood of Nashville.

==Theology==
The churches of the National Association of Free Will Baptists are theologically conservative and hold an Arminian view of salvation, notably in the belief of conditional security and rejection of the belief of eternal security held by many larger bodies of Baptists, such as most of Southern Baptists and adherents of African-American Baptist groups. The Arminian tradition was fashioned in the Netherlands in the 17th century against scholastic Calvinism and its deterministic interpretation of historic Christian teachings about predestination. Similar views, albeit with different emphases from Free Will Baptists, may be found in American Christianity within Methodism and the Restoration movement (e.g., Disciples of Christ, Churches of Christ).

In addition, NAFWB congregations differ from most Baptists in holding that three ordinances, rather than the two observed by most of Protestantism, must be practiced by the church; specifically, in addition to Believer&#x27;s Baptism (that is, administered to persons able to understand the significance of the ordinance, with a repentant heart) and the Lord&#x27;s supper practiced by other Baptists, Free Will Baptists also practice the ordinance of the washing of feet. In some churches, anointing with oil is also practiced, depending on local custom.

==Membership==
Since the middle of the 20th century, membership has remained near 200,000. In 2007, the Association reported having 2,369 churches and 185,798 members. Membership is concentrated in the Southern United States. The states with the highest membership rates are Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Alabama, and Kentucky.

Free Will Baptist North American Ministries (known as Free Will Baptist Home Missions until 2015) has 89 active mission works in 26 states. Their primary role is to send missionaries into North America to plant Free Will Baptist churches. Larry Powel is the Director of Home Missions. They generally have anywhere between 50 and 70 missionaries on the field at any given time. As of 2011 they have missionaries in Alabama, Michigan, South Carolina, Alaska, Minnesota, Tennessee, Arizona, Mississippi, Texas, California, New Mexico, Utah, Canada, New York, Virgin Islands, Colorado, Ohio, Virginia, Idaho, Oklahoma, Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Puerto Rico, Wisconsin, Mexico, and Rhode Island.

<doc id="340476" wikidata="Q849492" url="?curid=340476" title="Serial Peripheral Interface">
<text>Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a de facto standard (with many variants) for synchronous serial communication, used primarily in embedded systems for short-distance wired communication between integrated circuits.

SPI follows a master–slave architecture, where a master device orchestrates communication with one or more slave devices by driving the clock and chip select signals. Some devices support changing master and slave roles on the fly.

Motorola&#x27;s original specification (from the early 1980s) uses four logic signals, aka lines or wires, to support full duplex communication. It is sometimes called a &quot;four-wire&quot; serial bus to contrast with three-wire variants which are half duplex, and with the &quot;two-wire&quot; I²C and 1-Wire serial buses.

Typical applications include interfacing microcontrollers with peripheral chips for Secure Digital cards, liquid crystal displays, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters, flash and EEPROM memory, and various communication chips.

Although SPI is a synchronous serial interface, it is different from Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI). SSI employs differential signaling and provides only a single simplex communication channel.

==Operation==
Commonly, SPI has four logic signals. Variations may use different names or have different signals.

MOSI on a master outputs to MOSI on a slave. MISO on a slave outputs to MISO on a master.

Each device internally uses a shift register for serial communication, which together forms an inter-chip circular buffer.

Slave devices should use tri-state outputs so their MISO signal becomes high impedance (electrically disconnected) when the device is not selected. Slaves without tri-state outputs cannot share a MISO line with other slaves without using an external tri-state buffer.

===Data transmission===

To begin communication, the SPI master first selects a slave device by pulling its low. (Note: the bar above indicates it is an active low signal, so a low voltage means &quot;selected&quot;, while a high voltage means &quot;not selected&quot;)

If a waiting period is required, such as for an analog-to-digital conversion, the master must wait for at least that period of time before issuing clock cycles.

During each SPI clock cycle, full-duplex transmission of a single bit occurs. The master sends a bit on the MOSI line while the slave sends a bit on the MISO line, and then each reads their corresponding incoming bit. This sequence is maintained even when only one-directional data transfer is intended.

Transmission using a single slave involves one shift register in the master and one shift register in the slave, both of some given word size (e.g. 8 bits). The transmissions often consist of eight-bit words, but other word-sizes are also common, for example, sixteen-bit words for touch-screen controllers or audio codecs, such as the TSC2101 by Texas Instruments, or twelve-bit words for many digital-to-analog or analog-to-digital converters. 

Data is usually shifted out with the most-significant bit (MSB) first but the original specification has a LSBFE (&quot;LSB-First Enable&quot;) to control whether data is transferred least (LSB) or most significant bit (MSB) first. On the clock edge, both master and slave shift out a bit to its counterpart. On the next clock edge, each receiver samples the transmitted bit and stores it in the shift register as the new least-significant bit. After all bits have been shifted out and in, the master and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue for any number of clock cycles. When complete, the master stops toggling the clock signal, and typically deselects the slave.

If a single slave device is used, its pin &quot;may&quot; be fixed to logic low if the slave permits it. With multiple slave devices, a multidrop configuration requires an independent signal from the master for each slave device, while a daisy-chain configuration only requires one signal.

Every slave on the bus that has not been selected should disregard the input clock and MOSI signals. And to prevent contention on MISO, non-selected slaves must use tristate output. Slaves that aren&#x27;t already tristate will need external tristate buffers to ensure this.

===Clock polarity and phase===
In addition to setting the clock frequency, the master must also configure the clock polarity and phase with respect to the data. Motorola named these two options as CPOL and CPHA (for clock polarity and clock phase) respectively, a convention most vendors have also adopted.

The SPI timing diagram shown is further described below:
* CPOL represents the polarity of the clock. Polarities can be converted with a simple inverter.
** SCLK is a clock which idles at the logical low voltage.
** SCLK is a clock which idles at the logical high voltage.
* CPHA represents the phase of each data bit&#x27;s transmission cycle relative to SCLK.
** For CPHA=0:
*** The first data bit is output &quot;immediately&quot; when activates.
*** Subsequent bits are output when SCLK transitions &quot;to&quot; its idle voltage level.
*** Sampling occurs when SCLK transitions &quot;from&quot; its idle voltage level.
** For CPHA=1:
*** The first data bit is output on SCLK&#x27;s first clock edge &quot;after&quot; activates.
*** Subsequent bits are output when SCLK transitions &quot;from&quot; its idle voltage level.
*** Sampling occurs when SCLK transitions &quot;to&quot; its idle voltage level.
** Conversion between these two phases is non-trivial.
** Note: MOSI and MISO signals are usually stable (at their reception points) for the half cycle until the next bit&#x27;s transmission cycle starts, so SPI master and slave devices may sample data at different points in that half cycle, for flexibility, despite the original specification.

===Mode numbers ===
The combinations of polarity and phases are referred to by these &quot;SPI mode&quot; numbers with CPOL as the high order bit and CPHA as the low order bit:
Notes:

* Another commonly used notation represents the mode as a (CPOL, CPHA) tuple; e.g., the value &#x27;(0, 1)&#x27; would indicate CPOL=0 and CPHA=1.
* In Full Duplex operation, the master device could transmit and receive with different modes. For instance, it could transmit in Mode 0 and be receiving in Mode 1 at the same time.
* Different vendors may use different naming schemes, like CKE for clock edge or NCPHA for the inversion of CPHA.

=== Valid communications ===
Some slave devices are designed to ignore any SPI communications in which the number of clock pulses is greater than specified. Others do not care, ignoring extra inputs and continuing to shift the same output bit. It is common for different devices to use SPI communications with different lengths, as, for example, when SPI is used to access an IC&#x27;s scan chain by issuing a command word of one size (perhaps 32 bits) and then getting a response of a different size (perhaps 153 bits, one for each pin in that scan chain).

===Interrupts===
Interrupts are outside the scope of SPI; their usage is neither forbidden nor specified, and so may optionally be implemented.

==== From master to slave ====
Microcontrollers configured as slave devices may have hardware support for generating interrupt signals to themselves when data words are received or overflow occurs in a receive FIFO buffer, and may also set up an interrupt routine when their slave select input line is pulled low or high.

==== From slave to master ====
SPI slaves sometimes use an out-of-band signal (another wire) to send an interrupt signal to a master. Examples include pen-down interrupts from touchscreen sensors, thermal limit alerts from temperature sensors, alarms issued by real-time clock chips, SDIO and audio jack insertions for an audio codec. Interrupts to master may also be faked by using polling (similarly to USB 1.1 and 2.0).

===Software design===
SPI lends itself to a &quot;bus driver&quot; software design. Software for attached devices is written to call a &quot;bus driver&quot; that handles the actual low-level SPI hardware. This permits the driver code for attached devices to port easily to other hardware or a bit-banging software implementation.

===Bit-banging the protocol===
The pseudocode below outlines a software implementation (&quot;bit-banging&quot;) of SPI&#x27;s protocol as a master with simultaneous output and input. This pseudocode is for CPHA=0 and CPOL=0, thus SCLK is pulled low before is activated and bits are inputted on SCLK&#x27;s rising edge while bits are outputted on SCLK&#x27;s falling edge.

* Initialize SCLK as low and as high
* Pull low to select the slave
* Loop for however many number of bytes to transfer:
** Initializewith the next output byte to transmit
** Loop 8 times:
*** Left-Shift the next output bit fromto MOSI
*** NOP for the slave&#x27;s setup time
*** Pull SCLK high
*** Left-Shift the next input bit from MISO into
*** NOP for the slave&#x27;s hold time
*** Pull SCLK low
** now contains that recently-received byte and can be used as desired
* Pull high to unselect the slave
Bit-banging a slave&#x27;s protocol is similar but different from above. An implementation might involve busy waiting for to fall or triggering an interrupt routine when falls, and then shifting in and out bits when the received SCLK changes appropriately for however long the transfer size is.

== Bus topologies ==
Though the previous operation section focused on a basic interface with a single slave, SPI can instead communicate with multiple slaves using multidrop, daisy chain, or expander configurations.

===Multidrop configuration===

In the multidrop bus configuration, each slave has its own , and the master selects only one at a time. MISO, SCLK, and MOSI are each shared by all devices. This is the way SPI is normally used.

Since the MISO pins of the slaves are connected together, they are required to be tri-state pins (high, low or high-impedance), where the high-impedance output must be applied when the slave is not selected. Slave devices not supporting tri-state may be used in multidrop configuration by adding a tri-state buffer chip controlled by its signal. (Since only a single signal line needs to be tristated per slave, one typical standard logic chip that contains four tristate buffers with independent gate inputs can be used to interface up to four slave devices to an SPI bus)Caveat: All signals should start high (to indicate no slaves are selected) before sending initialization messages to any slave, so other uninitialized slaves ignore messages not addressed to them. This is a concern if the master uses general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins (which may default to an undefined state) for and if the master uses separate software libraries to initialize each device. One solution is to configure all GPIOs used for to output a high voltage for &quot;all&quot; slaves &quot;before&quot; running initialization code from any of those software libraries. Another solution is to add a pull-up resistor on each , to ensure that all signals are initially high.

===Daisy chain configuration===

Some products that implement SPI may be connected in a daisy chain configuration, where the first slave&#x27;s output is connected to the second slave&#x27;s input, and so on with subsequent slaves, until the final slave, whose output is connected back to the master&#x27;s input. This effectively merges the individual communication shift registers of each slave to form a single larger combined shift register that shifts data through the chain. This configuration only requires a single line from the master, rather than a separate line for each slave.

In addition to using SPI-specific slaves, daisy-chained SPI can include discrete shift registers for more pins of inputs (e.g. using the parallel-in serial-out 74xx165) or outputs (e.g. using the serial-in parallel-out 74xx595) chained indefinitely. Other applications that can potentially interoperate with daisy-chained SPI include SGPIO, JTAG, and I2C.

===Expander configurations===
Expander configurations use SPI-controlled addressing units (e.g. binary decoders, demultiplexers, or shift registers) to add chip selects.

For example, one can be used for transmitting to a SPI-controlled demultiplexer an index number controlling its select signals, while another is routed through that demultiplexer according to that index to select the desired slave.

==Pros and cons==

===Advantages===
* Full duplex communication in the default version of this protocol
* Push-pull drivers (as opposed to open drain) provide relatively good signal integrity and high speed
* Higher throughput than I²C or SMBus
** SPI&#x27;s protocol has no maximum clock speed, however:
*** Individual devices specify acceptable clock frequencies
*** Wiring and electronics limit frequency
* Complete protocol flexibility for the bits transferred
** Not limited to 8-bit symbols
** Arbitrary choice of message size, content, and purpose
* Simple hardware and interfacing
** Hardware implementation for slaves only requires a selectable shift register
*** Slaves use the master&#x27;s clock and hence do not need precision oscillators
*** Slaves do not need a unique address unlike I²C or GPIB or SCSI
*** Masters only additionally require generation of clock and signals
*** Results in simple bit-banged software implementation
** Uses only four pins on IC packages, and wires in board layouts or connectors, much fewer than parallel interfaces
*** At most one unique signal per device (); all others are shared
**** Note: the daisy-chain configuration doesn&#x27;t need more than one shared 
** Typically lower power requirements than I²C or SMBus due to less circuitry (including pull up resistors)
** Single master means no bus arbitration (and associated failure modes) - unlike CAN-bus
** Transceivers are not needed - unlike CAN-bus
** Signals are unidirectional, allowing for easy galvanic isolation

===Disadvantages===
* Requires more pins on IC packages than I²C, even in three-wire variants
* Only handles short distances compared to RS-232, RS-485, or CAN-bus (though distance can be extended with the use of transceivers like RS-422)
* Extensibility severely reduced when multiple slaves using different SPI Modes are required
** Access is slowed down when master frequently needs to reinitialize in different modes
* No formal standard
** So validating conformance is not possible
** Many existing variations complicate support
* No built-in protocol support for some conveniences:
** No hardware flow control by the slave (but the master can delay the next clock edge to slow the transfer rate)
** No hardware slave acknowledgment (the master could be transmitting to nowhere and not know it)
** No error-checking protocol
** No hot swapping (dynamically adding nodes)
** Interrupts are outside the scope of SPI (see )

==Applications==

SPI is used to talk to a variety of peripherals, such as
* Sensors: temperature, pressure, ADC, touchscreens, video game controllers
* Control devices: audio codecs, digital potentiometers, DACs
* Camera lenses: Canon EF lens mount
* Communications: Ethernet, USB, USART, CAN, IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.11
* Memory: flash and EEPROMs
* Real-time clocks
* LCDs, sometimes even for managing image data
* Any MMC or SD card (including SDIO variant)
* Shift registers for additional I/O
Board real estate and wiring savings compared to a parallel bus are significant, and have earned SPI a solid role in embedded systems. That is true for most system-on-a-chip processors, both with higher-end 32-bit processors such as those using ARM, MIPS, or PowerPC and with lower-end microcontrollers such as the AVR, PIC, and MSP430. These chips usually include SPI controllers capable of running in either master or slave mode. In-system programmable AVR controllers (including blank ones) can be programmed using SPI.

Chip or FPGA based designs sometimes use SPI to communicate between internal components; on-chip real estate can be as costly as its on-board cousin. And for high-performance systems, FPGAs sometimes use SPI to interface as a slave to a host, as a master to sensors, or for flash memory used to bootstrap if they are SRAM-based.

The full-duplex capability makes SPI very simple and efficient for single master/single slave applications. Some devices use the full-duplex mode to implement an efficient, swift data stream for applications such as digital audio, digital signal processing, or telecommunications channels, but most off-the-shelf chips stick to half-duplex request/response protocols.

==Variations==
SPI implementations have a wide variety of protocol variations. Some devices are transmit-only; others are receive-only. Slave selects are sometimes active-high rather than active-low. Some devices send the least-significant bit first. Signal levels depend entirely on the chips involved. And while the baseline SPI protocol has no command codes, every device may define its own protocol of command codes. Some variations are minor or informal, while others have an official defining document and may be considered to be separate but related protocols. 

=== Original definition ===
Motorola in 1983 listed three 6805 8-bit microcomputers that have an integrated &quot;Serial Peripheral Interface&quot;, whose functionality is described in a 1984 manual.

==== AN991 ====
Motorola&#x27;s 1987 Application Node AN991 &quot;Using the Serial Peripheral Interface to Communicate Between Multiple Microcomputers&quot; (now under NXP, last revised 2002) informally serves as the &quot;official&quot; defining document for SPI.

===Timing variations===
Some devices have timing variations from Motorola&#x27;s CPOL/CPHA modes. Sending data from slave to master may use the opposite clock edge as master to slave. Devices often require extra clock idle time before the first clock or after the last one, or between a command and its response.

Some devices have two clocks, one to read data, and another to transmit it into the device. Many of the read clocks run from the slave select line.

=== Transmission size ===
Different transmission word sizes are common. Many SPI chips only support messages that are multiples of 8 bits. Such chips can not interoperate with the JTAG or SGPIO protocols, or any other protocol that requires messages that are not multiples of 8 bits.

=== No slave select ===
Some devices don&#x27;t use slave select, and instead manage protocol state machine entry/exit using other methods.

=== Connectors ===
Anyone needing an external connector for SPI defines their own or uses another standard connection such as: UEXT, Pmod, various JTAG connectors, Secure Digital card socket, etc.

=== Flow control ===
Some devices require an additional flow control signal from slave to master, indicating when data is ready. This leads to a 5-wire protocol instead of the usual 4. Such a &quot;ready&quot; or &quot;enable&quot; signal is often active-low, and needs to be enabled at key points such as after commands or between words. Without such a signal, data transfer rates may need to be slowed down significantly, or protocols may need to have dummy bytes inserted, to accommodate the worst case for the slave response time. Examples include initiating an ADC conversion, addressing the right page of flash memory, and processing enough of a command that device firmware can load the first word of the response. (Many SPI masters do not support that signal directly, and instead rely on fixed delays.)

=== SafeSPI ===
SafeSPI is an industry standard for SPI in automotive applications. Its main focus is the transmission of sensor data between different devices.

=== High reliability modifications ===
In electrically noisy environments, since SPI has few signals, it can be economical to reduce the effects of common mode noise by adapting SPI to use low-voltage differential signaling. Another advantage is that the controlled devices can be designed to loop-back to test signal integrity.

=== Intelligent SPI controllers ===
A Queued Serial Peripheral Interface (QSPI; different to but has same abbreviation as &quot;Quad SPI&quot; described in ) is a type of SPI controller that uses a data queue to transfer data across an SPI bus. It has a wrap-around mode allowing continuous transfers to and from the queue with only intermittent attention from the CPU. Consequently, the peripherals appear to the CPU as memory-mapped parallel devices. This feature is useful in applications such as control of an A/D converter. Other programmable features in Queued SPI are chip selects and transfer length/delay.

SPI controllers from different vendors support different feature sets; such direct memory access (DMA) queues are not uncommon, although they may be associated with separate DMA engines rather than the SPI controller itself, such as used by Multichannel Buffered Serial Port (MCBSP). Most SPI master controllers integrate support for up to four slave selects, although some require slave selects to be managed separately through GPIO lines.

Note that &quot;Queued SPI&quot; is different from &quot;Quad SPI&quot;, and some processors even confusingly allow a single &quot;QSPI&quot; interface to operate in either quad or queued mode!

=== Microwire ===
Microwire, often spelled μWire, is essentially a predecessor of SPI and a trademark of National Semiconductor. It&#x27;s a strict subset of SPI: half-duplex, and using SPI mode 0. Microwire chips tend to need slower clock rates than newer SPI versions; perhaps 2 MHz vs. 20 MHz. Some Microwire chips also support a three-wire mode.

=== Microwire/Plus ===
Microwire/Plus is an enhancement of Microwire and features full-duplex communication and support for SPI modes 0 and 1. There was no specified improvement in serial clock speed.

=== Three-wire ===
Three-wire variants of SPI restricted to a half-duplex mode use a single bidirectional data line called SISO (slave out/slave in) or MOMI (master out/master in) instead of SPI&#x27;s two unidirectional lines (MOSI and MISO). Three-wire tends to be used for lower-performance parts, such as small EEPROMs used only during system startup, certain sensors, and Microwire. Few SPI controllers support this mode, although it can be easily bit-banged in software.

=== Dual SPI ===
For instances where the full-duplex nature of SPI is not used, an extension uses both data pins in a half-duplex configuration to send two bits per clock cycle. Typically a command byte is sent requesting a response in dual mode, after which the MOSI line becomes SIO0 (serial I/O 0) and carries even bits, while the MISO line becomes SIO1 and carries odd bits. Data is still transmitted most-significant bit first, but SIO1 carries bits 7, 5, 3 and 1 of each byte, while SIO0 carries bits 6, 4, 2 and 0.

This is particularly popular among SPI ROMs, which have to send a large amount of data, and comes in two variants:

* Dual read sends the command and address from the master in single mode, and returns the data in dual mode.
* Dual I/O sends the command in single mode, then sends the address and return data in dual mode.

=== Quad SPI ===
Quad SPI (QSPI; different to but has same abbreviation as &quot;Queued-SPI&quot; described in ) goes beyond dual SPI, adding two more I/O lines (SIO2 and SIO3) and sends 4 data bits per clock cycle. Again, it is requested by special commands, which enable quad mode after the command itself is sent in single mode.

; SQI Type 1: Commands sent on single line but addresses and data sent on four lines
; SQI Type 2: Commands and addresses sent on a single line but data sent/received on four lines

=== QPI/SQI ===
Further extending quad SPI, some devices support a &quot;quad everything&quot; mode where &quot;all&quot; communication takes place over 4 data lines, including commands. This is variously called &quot;QPI&quot; (not to be confused with Intel QuickPath Interconnect) or &quot;serial quad I/O&quot; (SQI)

This requires programming a configuration bit in the device and requires care after reset to establish communication.

=== Double data rate ===
In addition to using multiple lines for I/O, some devices increase the transfer rate by using double data rate transmission.

=== JTAG ===

Although there are some similarities between SPI and the JTAG (IEEE 1149.1-2013) protocol, they are not interchangeable. JTAG is specifically intended to provide reliable test access to the I/O pins from an off-board controller with less precise signal delay and skew parameters, while SPI has many varied applications. While not strictly a level sensitive interface, the JTAG protocol supports the recovery of both setup and hold violations between JTAG devices by reducing the clock rate or changing the clock&#x27;s duty cycles. Consequently, the JTAG interface is not intended to support extremely high data rates.

=== SGPIO ===

SGPIO is essentially another (incompatible) application stack for SPI designed for particular backplane management activities. SGPIO uses 3-bit messages.

===Intel&#x27;s Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface===
Intel has developed a successor to its Low Pin Count (LPC) bus that it calls the Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface (eSPI) bus. Intel aims to reduce the number of pins required on motherboards and increase throughput compared to LPC, reduce the working voltage to 1.8 volts to facilitate smaller chip manufacturing processes, allow eSPI peripherals to share SPI flash devices with the host (the LPC bus did not allow firmware hubs to be used by LPC peripherals), tunnel previous out-of-band pins through eSPI, and allow system designers to trade off cost and performance.

An eSPI bus can either be shared with SPI devices to save pins or be separate from an SPI bus to allow more performance, especially when eSPI devices need to use SPI flash devices.

This standard defines an Alert# signal that is used by an eSPI slave to request service from the master. In a performance-oriented design or a design with only one eSPI slave, each eSPI slave will have its Alert# pin connected to an Alert# pin on the eSPI master that is dedicated to each slave, allowing the eSPI master to grant low-latency service, because the eSPI master will know which eSPI slave needs service and will not need to poll all of the slaves to determine which device needs service. In a budget design with more than one eSPI slave, all of the Alert# pins of the slaves are connected to one Alert# pin on the eSPI master in a wired-OR connection, which requires the master to poll all the slaves to determine which ones need service when the Alert# signal is pulled low by one or more peripherals that need service. Only after all of the devices are serviced will the Alert# signal be pulled high due to none of the eSPI slaves needing service and therefore pulling the Alert# signal low.

This standard allows designers to use 1-bit, 2-bit, or 4-bit communications at speeds from 20 to 66 MHz to further allow designers to trade off performance and cost.

Communications that were out-of-band of LPC like general-purpose input/output (GPIO) and System Management Bus (SMBus) should be tunneled through eSPI via virtual wire cycles and out-of-band message cycles respectively in order to remove those pins from motherboard designs using eSPI.

This standard supports standard memory cycles with lengths of 1 byte to 4 kilobytes of data, short memory cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes that have much less overhead compared to standard memory cycles, and I/O cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes of data which are low overhead as well. This significantly reduces overhead compared to the LPC bus, where all cycles except for the 128-byte firmware hub read cycle spends more than one-half of all of the bus&#x27;s throughput and time in overhead. The standard memory cycle allows a length of anywhere from 1 byte to 4 kilobytes in order to allow its larger overhead to be amortised over a large transaction. eSPI slaves are allowed to initiate bus master versions of all of the memory cycles. Bus master I/O cycles, which were introduced by the LPC bus specification, and ISA-style DMA including the 32-bit variant introduced by the LPC bus specification, are not present in eSPI. Therefore, bus master memory cycles are the only allowed DMA in this standard.

eSPI slaves are allowed to use the eSPI master as a proxy to perform flash operations on a standard SPI flash memory slave on behalf of the requesting eSPI slave.

64-bit memory addressing is also added, but is only permitted when there is no equivalent 32-bit address.

The Intel Z170 chipset can be configured to implement either this bus or a variant of the LPC bus that is missing its ISA-style DMA capability and is underclocked to 24 MHz instead of the standard 33 MHz.

The eSPI bus is also adopted by AMD Ryzen chipsets.

==Development tools==

=== Single-board computers ===
Single-board computers may provide pin access to SPI hardware units. For instance, the Raspberry Pi&#x27;s J8 header exposes at least two SPI units that can be used via Linux drivers or python.

=== USB to SPI adapters ===
There are a number of USB adapters that allow a desktop PC or smartphone with USB to communicate with SPI chips (e.g. CH341A/B based or FT221xs). They are used for embedded systems, chips (FPGA, ASIC, and SoC) and peripheral testing, programming and debugging. Many of them also provide scripting or programming capabilities (e.g. Visual Basic, C/C++, VHDL) and can be used with open source programs like flashrom, IMSProg, SNANDer or avrdude for flash, EEPROM, bootloader and BIOS programming.

The key SPI parameters are: the maximum supported frequency for the serial interface, command-to-command latency, and the maximum length for SPI commands. It is possible to find SPI adapters on the market today that support up to 100 MHz serial interfaces, with virtually unlimited access length.

SPI protocol being a de facto standard, some SPI host adapters also have the ability of supporting other protocols beyond the traditional 4-wire SPI (for example, support of quad-SPI protocol or other custom serial protocol that derive from SPI).

===Protocol analyzers===

Logic analyzers are tools which collect, timestamp, analyze, decode, store, and view the high-speed waveforms, to help debug and develop. Most logic analyzers have the capability to decode SPI bus signals into high-level protocol data with human-readable labels.

==== Oscilloscopes ====
SPI waveforms can be seen on analog channels (and/or via digital channels in mixed-signal oscilloscopes). Most oscilloscope vendors offer optional support for SPI protocol analysis (both 2-, 3-, and 4-wire SPI) with triggering.

==Alternative terminology==
Various alternative abbreviations for the four common SPI signals are used. (This section omits overbars indicating active-low.)

* Serial clock
** SCK, SCLK, CLK, SCL
* Master Out Slave In (MOSI)
** SIMO, MTSR, SPID - correspond to MOSI on both master and slave devices, connects to each other
** SDI, DI, DIN, SI, SDA - on slave devices; various abbreviations for &quot;serial data in&quot;; connects to MOSI on master
** SDO, DO, DOUT, SO - on master devices; various abbreviations for &quot;serial data out&quot;; connects to MOSI on slave
** COPI, PICO for &quot;peripheral&quot; and &quot;controller&quot;, or COTI for &quot;controller&quot; and &quot;target&quot;
* Master In Slave Out (MISO)
** SOMI, MRST, SPIQ - correspond to MISO on both master and slave devices, connects to each other
** SDO, DO, DOUT, SO - on slave devices; connects to MISO on master
** SDI, DI, DIN, SI - on master devices; connects to MISO on slave
** CIPO, POCI, or CITO
* Slave Select (SS)
** Chip select (CS)
** CE (chip enable)
** Historical: SSEL, NSS, /SS, SS#

Microchip uses &quot;host&quot; and &quot;client&quot; though keeps the abbreviation MOSI and MISO.

<text>Rotoscoping is an animation technique that animators use to trace over motion picture footage, frame by frame, to produce realistic action. Originally, live-action film images were projected onto a glass panel and traced onto paper. This projection equipment is referred to as a rotoscope, developed by Polish-American animator Max Fleischer. This device was eventually replaced by computers, but the process is still called rotoscoping.

In the visual effects industry, &quot;rotoscoping&quot; refers to the technique of manually creating a matte for an element on a live-action plate so it may be composited over another background. Chroma key is more often used to achieve the same background replacement effect, as it is faster and requires less work in post production. Rotoscoping generally provides a higher level of accuracy and may be used in conjunction with Chroma-keying. It may also be used if the subject is not in front of a green (or blue) screen, or for practical or economic reasons.

==Technique==

Rotoscoping has often been used as a tool for visual effects in live-action films. By tracing an object, the filmmaker creates a silhouette (called a matte) that can be used to extract that object from a scene for use on a different background. While blue- and green-screen techniques have made the process of layering subjects in scenes easier, rotoscoping still plays a large role in the production of visual effects imagery. Rotoscoping in the digital domain is often aided by motion-tracking and onion-skinning software. Rotoscoping is often used in the preparation of garbage mattes for other matte-pulling processes.

Rotoscoping has also been used to create a special visual effect (such as a glow, for example) that is guided by the matte or rotoscoped line. A classic use of traditional rotoscoping was in the original three &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, where the production used it to create the glowing lightsaber effect with a matte based on sticks held by the actors. To achieve this, effects technicians traced a line over each frame with the prop, then enlarged each line and added the glow.

==History==

===Predecessors===
Eadweard Muybridge had some of his famous chronophotographic sequences painted on glass discs for the zoopraxiscope projector that he used in his popular lectures between 1880 and 1895. The first discs were painted on the glass in dark contours. Discs made between 1892 and 1894 had outlines drawn by Erwin Faber photographically printed on the disc and then colored by hand, but these discs were probably never used in the lectures.

By 1902, Nuremberg toy companies Gebrüder Bing and Ernst Plank were offering chromolithographed film loops for their toy kinematographs. The films were traced from live-action film footage.

===Early works and Fleischer&#x27;s exclusivity===
The rotoscope technique was invented by animator Max Fleischer in 1915, and used in his groundbreaking &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; animated series (1918–1927). It was known simply as the &quot;Fleischer Process&quot; on the early screen credits, and was essentially exclusive to Fleischer for several years. The live-film reference for the character, later known as Koko the Clown, was performed by his brother (Dave Fleischer) dressed in a clown costume.

Conceived as a shortcut to animating, the rotoscope process proved time-consuming due to the precise and laborious nature of tracing. Rotoscoping is achieved by two methods, rear projection and front surface projection. In either case, the results can have slight deviations from the true line due to the separation of the projected image and the surface used for tracing. Misinterpretations of the forms cause the line to wiggle, and the roto tracings must be reworked over an animation disc, using the tracings as a guide where consistency and solidity are important.

Fleischer ceased to depend on the rotoscope for fluid action by 1924, when Dick Huemer became the animation director and brought his animation experience from his years on the &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; series. Fleischer returned to rotoscoping in the 1930s for referencing intricate dance movements in his Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons. The most notable of these are the dance routines originating from jazz performer Cab Calloway in &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; (1932), &quot;Snow-White&quot; (1933), and &quot;The Old Man of the Mountain&quot; (1933). In these examples, the roto tracing was used as a guide for timing and positioning, while the cartoon characters of different proportions were drawn to conform to those positions.

Fleischer&#x27;s last applications of the rotoscope were for the realistic human animation required for the lead character—among others—in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1939), and the human characters in his last feature, &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot; (1941). His most effective use of rotoscoping was in the action-oriented film noir &quot;Superman&quot; series of the early 1940s, where realistic movement was achieved on a level unmatched by conventional cartoon animation.

Contemporary uses of the rotoscope and its inherent challenges have included surreal effects in music videos such as Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot; (1978), Klaatu&#x27;s &quot;Routine Day&quot; (1979), Lawrence Gowan&#x27;s &quot;A Criminal Mind&quot; (1985), A-ha&#x27;s &quot;Take On Me&quot; (1985), the live performance scenes in Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; (1985), Kansas&#x27; &quot;All I Wanted&quot; (1986), and the animated TV series &quot;Delta State&quot; (2004). In the experimental 1973 short &quot;Hunger&quot; by Peter Foldes, every 12th frame of the footage of a gogo dancer was rotoscoped, with all the inbetweening done by software.

===Uses by other studios===
Fleischer&#x27;s patent expired by 1934, and other producers could then use rotoscoping freely. Walt Disney and his animators used the technique extensively in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; in order to make the human characters&#x27; motions more realistic. The film went significantly over budget due to the complexity of the animation.

Rotoscoping was a popular technique in early animated films made in the Soviet Union. Most films produced with it were adaptations of folk tales or poems—for example, &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; or &quot;The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish&quot;. Only during the early 1960s, after the &quot;Khrushchev Thaw&quot;, did animators start to explore very different aesthetics.

The makers of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; used rotoscoping in the &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; sequence. Director Martin Scorsese used rotoscoping to remove a large chunk of cocaine hanging from Neil Young&#x27;s nose in his rock documentary &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;.

Ralph Bakshi used rotoscoping extensively for his animated features &quot;Wizards&quot; (1977), &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1978), &quot;American Pop&quot; (1981), &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; (1983), and &quot;Cool World&quot; (1992). Bakshi first used rotoscoping because 20th Century Fox refused his request for a $50,000 budget increase to finish &quot;Wizards&quot;; he resorted to the rotoscope technique to finish the battle sequences.

Rotoscoping was also used in &quot;Tom Waits For No One&quot; (1979), a short film made by John Lamb, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (1981), &quot;What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?&quot; (1983) and &quot;It&#x27;s Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown&quot; (1984); the Dire Straits &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; (1985), three of A-ha&#x27;s music videos, &quot;Take On Me&quot; (1985), &quot;The Sun Always Shines on T.V.&quot; (1985), and &quot;Train of Thought&quot; (1986); Don Bluth&#x27;s &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; (1982), &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986), &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot; (closing credits), &quot;The BFG&quot; (1989), &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; (2000); and Nina Paley&#x27;s &quot;Sita Sings the Blues&quot; (2008).

In 1994, Smoking Car Productions invented a digital rotoscoping process to develop its critically acclaimed adventure video game &quot;The Last Express&quot;. The process was awarded , &quot;Digital Cartoon and Animation Process&quot;. The game was designed by Jordan Mechner, who had used rotoscoping extensively in his previous games &quot;Karateka&quot; and &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;.

During the mid-1990s, Bob Sabiston, an animator and computer scientist veteran of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab, developed a computer-assisted &quot;interpolated rotoscoping&quot; process, which he used to make his award-winning short film &quot;Snack and Drink&quot;. Director Richard Linklater subsequently employed Sabiston and his proprietary rotoscope software in the full-length feature films &quot;Waking Life&quot; (2001) and &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (2006). Linklater licensed the same proprietary rotoscoping process for the look of both films. Linklater was the first director to use digital rotoscoping to create an entire feature film. Additionally, a 2005–08 advertising campaign by Charles Schwab used Sabiston&#x27;s rotoscoping work for a series of television commercials, with the tagline &quot;Talk to Chuck&quot;. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; used rotoscope as a couch gag in the episode Barthood, with Lisa describing it as &quot;a noble experiment that failed&quot;.

In 2013, the anime &quot;The Flowers of Evil&quot; used rotoscoping to produce a look that differed greatly from its manga source material. Viewers criticized the show&#x27;s shortcuts in facial animation, its reuse of backgrounds, and the liberties it took with realism. Despite this, critics lauded the film, and the website Anime News Network awarded it a perfect score for initial reactions.

In early 2015, the anime film &quot;The Case of Hana &amp; Alice&quot; (animated prequel to the 2004 live-action film, &quot;Hana and Alice&quot;) was entirely animated with Rotoshop. It was far better received than &quot;The Flowers of Evil&quot;, with critics praising its rotoscoping. In 2015, &quot;&quot;, a short-form horror anime series using rotoscoping, aired on Japanese TV.

&quot;The Spine of Night&quot; (2021), a feature-length fantasy film directed by Philip Gelatt and Morgan Galen King was rotoscope animated. King&#x27;s Gorgonaut Studios had previously rotoscope animated a series of short fantasy films.

<text>RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value and segmenting customers which is commonly used in database marketing and direct marketing. It has received particular attention in the retail and professional services industries.

RFM stands for the three dimensions:
*Recency – &quot;How recently did the customer purchase?&quot;
*Frequency – &quot;How often do they purchase?&quot;
*Monetary Value – &quot;How much do they spend?&quot;

==Core model==
Customer purchases may be represented by a table with columns for the customer name, date of purchase and purchase value. There are many approaches to quantitatively defining RFM values, and the best approaches will be dependent on customer journey and business model. One approach to RFM is to assign a score for each dimension on a scale from 1 to 10. The maximum score represents the preferred behavior and a formula could be used to calculate the three scores for each customer. For example, a service-based business could use these calculations:

* Recency = 10 – the number of months that have passed since the customer last purchased 
* Frequency = the maximum of &quot;the number of purchases by the customer in the last 12 months (with a limit of 10)&quot; and 1
* Monetary = the highest value of all purchases by the customer expressed in relation to some benchmark value

For example, if the monetary benchmark allocated a score of 10 to annual spend over $500, for a customer who had made three purchases in the last year, the most recent being 3 months ago, and spent $600 in the year, their scores would be: R=7; F=3; M=10. Alternatively, categories can be defined for each attribute, e.g. recency might be broken into three categories: customers with purchases within the last 90 days; between 91 and 365 days; and longer than 365 days. Such categories may be derived from business rules or using data mining techniques to find meaningful breaks.

Once each of the attributes has appropriate categories defined, segments are created from the intersection of the values. If there were three categories for each attribute, then the resulting matrix would have twenty-seven possible combinations. One well-known commercial approach uses five bins per attributes, which yields 125 segments. Companies may also decide to collapse certain subsegments, if the gradations appear too small to be useful. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value). Identifying the most valuable RFM segments can capitalize on chance relationships in the data used for this analysis. For this reason, it is highly recommended that another set of data be used to validate the results of the RFM segmentation process. Advocates of this technique point out that it has the virtue of simplicity: no specialized statistical software is required, and the results are readily understood by business people. In the absence of other targeting techniques, it can provide a lift in response rates for promotions.

==Usage==
RFM is widely used for segmenting customers in the catalog industry. Brynjolfsson &quot;et al&quot;. apply it to analysing internet search and sales behaviour.

==Variations==

RFD – Recency, Frequency, Duration is a modified version of RFM analysis that can be used to analyze consumer behavior of viewership/readership/surfing oriented business products. (For example, amount of time spent by surfers on Wikipedia)

RFE – Recency, Frequency, Engagement is a broader version of the RFD analysis, where &quot;Engagement&quot; can be defined to include visit duration, pages per visit or other such metrics.

RFM-I – Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value – Interactions is a version of RFM framework modified to account for recency and frequency of marketing interactions with the client (e.g. to control for possible deterring effects of very frequent advertising engagements).

RFMTC – Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value, Time, Churn rate is an augmented RFM model proposed by Yeh et al. (2009). The model utilizes Bernoulli sequence in probability theory and creates formulas that calculate the probability of a customer buying at the next promotional or marketing campaign. This model has been implemented by Alexandros Ioannidis for datasets such as the Blood Transfusion and CDNOW data sets.

<doc id="340481" wikidata="Q1229213" url="?curid=340481" title="Display Data Channel">
<text>Display Data Channel (DDC) is a collection of protocols for digital communication between a computer display and a graphics adapter that enable the display to communicate its supported display modes to the adapter and that enable the computer host to adjust monitor parameters, such as brightness and contrast.

Like modern analog VGA connectors, the DVI and DisplayPort connectors include pins for DDC, but DisplayPort only supports DDC within its optional Dual-Mode DP (DP++) feature in DVI/HDMI mode.

The standard was created by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA).

==Overview==

The DDC suite of standards aims to provide Plug and Play and DPMS power management experiences for computer displays.

DDC1 and DDC2B/Ab/B+/Bi protocols are a physical link between a monitor and a video card, which was originally carried on either two or three pins in a 15-pin analog VGA connector.

Extended display identification data (EDID) is a companion standard; it defines a compact binary file format describing the monitor&#x27;s capabilities and supported graphics modes, stored in a read-only memory (EEPROM) chip programmed by the manufacturer of the monitor. The format uses a description block containing 128 bytes of data, with optional extension blocks to provide additional information. The most current version is &quot;Enhanced EDID (E-EDID) Release A, v2.0&quot;. DisplayID is aim to replace EDID, which supports many features such as HDR and color management.

The first version of the DDC standard was adopted in August 1994. It included the EDID 1.0 format and specified DDC1, DDC2B and DDC2Ab physical links.

&quot;DDC version 2&quot;, introduced in April 1996, split EDID into a separate standard and introduced the DDC2B+ protocol.

&quot;DDC version 3&quot;, December 1997, introduced the DDC2Bi protocol and support for VESA Plug and Display and Flat Panel Display Interface on separate device addresses, requiring them to comply with EDID 2.0.

The DDC standard has been superseded by E-DDC in 1999.

DDC is also used as a communication channel for implementing High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP).

==Physical link==
Prior to the DDC, the VGA standard had reserved four pins in the analog VGA connector, known as ID0, ID1, ID2 and ID3 (pins 11, 12, 4 and 15) for identification of monitor type. These ID pins, attached to resistors to pull one or more of them to ground (GND), allowed for the definition of the monitor type, with all open (n/c, not connected) meaning &quot;no monitor&quot;.

In the most commonly documented scheme, the ID3 pin was unused and only the 3 remaining pins were defined. The ID0 was pulled to GND by color monitors, while the monochrome monitors pulled ID1 to GND. Finally, the ID2 pulled to GND signaled a monitor capable of 1024×768 resolution, such as IBM 8514. In this scheme, the input states of the ID pins would encode the monitor type as follows:

More elaborate schemes also existed that used all of the 4 ID pins while manipulating the HSync and VSync signals in order to extract 16 bits (4 ID pin values for each of the 4 combinations of HSync and VSync states) of monitor identification.

DDC changed the purpose of the ID pins to incorporate a serial link interface. However, during the transition, the change was not backwards-compatible and video cards using the old scheme could have problems if a DDC-capable monitor was connected. The DDC signal can be sent to or from a video graphics array (VGA) monitor with the I2C protocol using the master&#x27;s serial clock and serial data pins.

===DDC1===
DDC1 is a simple, low-speed, unidirectional serial link protocol. Pin 12, ID1 functions as a data line that continuously transmits the 128-byte EDID block, and the data clock is synchronised with vertical sync, providing typical clock rates of 60 to 100 Hz.

Very few display devices implemented this protocol.

=== DDC2 ===
The most common version, called DDC2B, is based on I²C, a serial bus. Pin 12, ID1, of the VGA connector is used as the data pin of the I²C bus, and the formerly-unused pin 15 is the I²C clock. Pin 9, previously used as a mechanical key, supplies +5V DC power (up to 50mA) to power the EEPROM. With this, the host can read the EDID even if the monitor is powered off. Though I²C is fully bidirectional and supports multiple bus-masters, DDC2B is unidirectional and allows only one bus master—the graphics adapter. The monitor acts as a slave device at the 7-bit I²C address 50h, and provides 128-256 bytes of read-only EDID. Because this access is always a read, the first I²C octet will always be A1h.
DDC2Ab is an implementation of the I²C-based 100-kbit/s ACCESS.bus interface, which made it possible for monitor manufacturers to support external ACCESS.bus peripherals such as a mouse or keyboard with little to no additional effort. Such devices and monitors were briefly available in the mid-1990s, but they disappeared with the introduction of USB.

DDC2B+ and DDC2Bi are scaled-down versions of DDC2Ab which only support monitor and graphics card devices but still allow bidirectional communication between them.

DDC2 is not exclusive to the VGA interface. Both DVI and HDMI feature dedicated DDC2B wires.

==DDC/CI==
DDC/CI (Command Interface) standard was introduced in August 1998. It specifies a means for a computer to send commands to the monitor, as well as receive sensor data from the monitor, over a bidirectional link. Specific commands to control monitors are defined in a separate Monitor Control Command Set (MCCS) standard version 1.0, released in September 1998.

DDC/CI monitors are sometimes supplied with an external color sensor to allow automatic calibration of the monitor&#x27;s color balance. Some tilting DDC/CI monitors support an auto-pivot function, where a rotation sensor in the monitor enables the operating system to keep the display upright as the monitor is moved between its portrait and landscape positions.

Most DDC/CI monitors support only a small subset of MCCS commands and some have undocumented commands. Many manufacturers did not pay attention to DDC/CI in the past, but now almost all monitors support such general MCCS commands as brightness and contrast management.

&quot;DDC/CI&quot; standard describes a full suite of bidirectional control protocols - DDC2Ab, DDC2Bi and DDC2B+ - in a single standard and provides a means for packaging Monitor Control Command Set commands.

DDC/CI version 1.1 was adopted in October 2004.

&quot;Monitor Control Command Set&quot; version 2.0 was adopted in October 2003. A new MCCS V3 was introduced in July 2006, though did not gain enough industry attention yet. The latest release of V2 standard is version 2.2a, adopted January 2011.

=== OS support for DDC/CI ===
Despite its ubiquity in post-2016 displays, DDC/CI is not generally used by the operating system by default for brightness control on external displays. Additional software can be used to send commands to the display, but the degree of system integration vary.

Windows exposes DDC/CI as the &quot;Monitor Configuration&quot; Win32 API series.

==E-DDC==
Enhanced Display Data Channel (E-DDC) is the most recent revision of the DDC standard. Version 1 was introduced in September 1999 and featured the addition of a segment pointer which allowed up to 32 Kbytes of display information storage for use by the Enhanced EDID (E-EDID) standard.

Earlier DDC implementations used simple 8-bit data offset when communicating with the EDID memory in the monitor, limiting the storage size to 28 bytes = 256 bytes, but allowing the use of cheap 2-Kbit EEPROMs. In E-DDC, a special I²C addressing scheme was introduced, in which multiple 256-byte segments could be selected. To do this, a single 8-bit segment index is passed to the display via the I²C address 30h. (Because this access is always a write, the first I²C octet will always be 60h.) Data from the selected segment is then immediately read via the regular DDC2 address using a repeated I²C &#x27;START&#x27; signal. However, VESA specification defines the segment index value range as 00h to 7Fh, so this only allows addressing 128 segments × 256 bytes = . The segment index register is volatile, defaulting to zero and automatically resetting to zero after each NACK or STOP. Therefore, it must be set every time access to data above the first 256-byte segment is performed. The auto-reset mechanism is to provide for backward compatibility to, for example, DDC2B hosts, otherwise they may be stuck at a segment other than 00h in some rare cases.

Other important changes were removal of the DDC1 and DDC2Ab protocols, deprecation of separate VESA P&amp;D and FPDI device addresses, and clarifications to the DDC power requirements.

&quot;E-DDC Version 1.1&quot;, approved March 2004, featured support for HDMI and consumer electronics.

&quot;E-DDC Version 1.2&quot;, approved December 2007, introduced support for DisplayPort (which has no dedicated DDC2B links and uses its bidirectional auxiliary channel for EDID and MCCS communication) and DisplayID standards.

&quot;E-DDC Version 1.3&quot; from September 2017 contains corrections for errata and minor clarifications.

==Disabling DDC==
Some KVM switches (keyboard-video-mouse) and video extenders handle DDC traffic incorrectly, making it necessary to disable monitor plug and play features in the operating system, and maybe even physically remove pin 12 (serial data pin) from the analog VGA cables that connect such device to multiple PCs.

Microsoft Windows features a standard &quot;Plug and Play Monitor&quot; driver which uses the display&#x27;s EDID information to construct a list of supported monitor modes. The Display Resolution control panel applet can be used to disable this driver&#x27;s Plug and Play features and manually select any resolution or refresh rate supported by the video card. Many video card manufacturers and third parties provide control applications which can be used to select a custom display mode that does not conform to the EDID information or the monitor .INF file.

<text>Charles Marion Russell (March 19, 1864 – October 24, 1926), also known as C. M. Russell, Charlie Russell, and &quot;Kid&quot; Russell, was an American artist of the American Old West. He created more than 2,000 paintings of cowboys, Native Americans, and landscapes set in the western United States and in Alberta, Canada, in addition to bronze sculptures. He is known as &quot;the cowboy artist&quot; and was also a storyteller and author. He became an advocate for Native Americans in the west, supporting the bid by landless Chippewa to have a reservation established for them in Montana. In 1916, Congress passed legislation to create the Rocky Boy Reservation.

The C. M. Russell Museum Complex in Great Falls, Montana houses more than 2,000 Russell artworks, personal objects, and artifacts. Other major collections are held at the Montana Historical Society in Helena, Montana, the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody, Wyoming, the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth, Texas, and the Sid Richardson Museum in Fort Worth. His 1912 mural &quot;Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross&#x27; Hole&quot; hangs in the House chambers of the Montana Capitol in Helena, and his 1918 painting &quot;Piegans&quot; sold for $5.6 million at a 2005 auction. In 1955, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

== Childhood ==
Art was always a part of Russell&#x27;s life. Growing up in Missouri, he drew sketches and made clay figures of animals. Russell had an intense interest in the &quot;wild west&quot; and would spend hours reading about it. Russell would watch explorers and fur traders who frequently came through Missouri. He learned to ride horses at Hazel Dell Farm near Jerseyville, Illinois, on a famous Civil War horse named Great Britain. Russell&#x27;s instructor was Col. William H. Fulkerson, who had married into the Russell family. At the age of sixteen, Russell left school and went to Montana to work on a sheep ranch.

== Montana and the West ==
Russell left the sheep ranch and found work with Jake Hoover, a hunter and trapper who had become a rancher. He owned land in the Judith Basin of Central Montana. Russell learned much about the ways of the West from him, and the two men remained lifelong friends. After a brief visit in 1882 to his family in Missouri, Russell returned to Montana, and lived and worked there for the remainder of his life.

He worked as a cowboy for a number of outfits, and documented the harsh winter of 1886–1887 in a number of watercolors. Russell was working on the O-H Ranch in the Judith Basin at the time. The ranch foreman received a letter from the owner, asking how the cattle herd had weathered the winter. In reply, the foreman sent a postcard-sized watercolor that Russell had painted of a gaunt steer being watched by wolves under a gray winter sky. The ranch owner showed the postcard to friends and business acquaintances, and eventually displayed it in a shop window in Helena, Montana. After this, the artist began to receive commissions for new work. Russell&#x27;s caption on the sketch, &quot;Waiting for a Chinook&quot;, became the title of the watercolor. Russell later painted a more detailed version of the scene which became one of his best-known works.

Beginning in 1888, Russell spent a period living with the Blood Indians, a branch of the Blackfeet nation. Scholars believe that he gained much of his intimate knowledge of Native American culture during this period. When he returned to the Judith Basin in 1889, he found it filling with settlers. He worked in more open places for a couple of years before settling in the area of Great Falls, Montana, in 1892. There he worked to make a living as a full-time artist.

In 1896, Russell married his wife Nancy. He was 32 and she was 18. In 1897, they moved from the small community of Cascade, Montana to the bustling county seat of Great Falls. Russell spent the majority of the remainder of his life there. He continued with his art, becoming a local celebrity and gaining the acclaim of critics worldwide. As Russell was not skilled in marketing his work, Nancy is generally given credit for making him an internationally known artist. She set up many shows for Russell throughout the United States and in London, creating many followers of Russell.

In 1912 he joined cowboy artist Frank Tenney Johnson on a sketching expedition to the Blackfoot Reservation east of Glacier National Park in Montana.
In 1913, Russell painted &quot;Wild Horse Hunters&quot;, which depicts riders capturing wild horses, each band of which is dominated by a stallion. He used as much color as an artist could on his mountain landscapes. As an artist, Russell emerged at a time when the Wild West was of intense interest to people who lived in cities, and cattle drives were still being conducted over long distances. He painted images of the Old West that were later adopted by Westerns, which became a movie staple.

Russell was fond of these popular art forms and made many friends among the well-off collectors of his works, including actors and film makers such as William S. Hart, Harry Carey, Will Rogers, and Douglas Fairbanks. Russell also kept up with fellow artists of the West, including painter Edgar Samuel Paxson, painter Edward &quot;Ed&quot; Borein, illustrator and painter Maynard Dixon and Will Crawford the illustrator.

On the day of Russell&#x27;s funeral in 1926, the children in Great Falls were released from school so they could watch the funeral procession. Russell&#x27;s coffin was displayed in a glass-sided coach, pulled by four black horses.

Russell produced about 4,000 works of art, including oil and watercolor paintings, drawings and sculptures in wax, clay, plaster and other materials, some of which were also cast in bronze.

== Depictions of Charles Marion Russell ==


== Tributes ==
A collection of short stories called &quot;Trails Plowed Under&quot; was published a year after his death.
In 1960, Charles M. Russell Elementary School was built in Missoula, Montana. In 1965, a high school was built on the north side of the Missouri River in Great Falls, Montana and named Charles M. Russell High School, in honor of Russell. Ian Tyson&#x27;s 1987 album, &quot;Cowboyography&quot;, includes a song titled &quot;The Gift&quot; telling the story of Russell. Michael Nesmith, of Monkees fame, recorded a song titled &quot;Laugh Kills Lonesome&quot; which was inspired by, and describes the contents of, a well-known Russell painting of the same name. Native Blackfeet folk singer Jack Gladstone wrote a song dedicated to Russell titled &quot;When the Land Belonged to God.&quot; The song describes Russell&#x27;s painting of the same name.

In 1985, Russell was inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame in New York. In 1991, Russell was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.
Some of Russell&#x27;s paintings were shown during the credits of the ABC television series &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, starring James Arness. James McDowell Sr. of Tulsa, Oklahoma donated 24 volumes of his illustrations to the Western History Collections at the University of Oklahoma in 1997.

Russell was inducted into the inaugural class of the Montana Outdoor Hall of Fame in 2014. He is honored at the Stockmen&#x27;s Memorial in Cochrane, Alberta, Canada.

The Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge is named for Russell, a World War II Liberty Ship, &quot;SS Charles M. Russell&quot;, was named in his honor and launched in 1943 in Portland, Oregon.

The Bull Head Lodge and Studio, located off Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park, was Russell&#x27;s summer home, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Auction ==
Russell&#x27;s &quot;Piegans&quot; sold in 2005 for $5.6 million, more than double the highest price his work had sold for a few years earlier. At auction in 2008, Russell&#x27;s oil painting &quot;The Hold Up (20 Miles to Deadwood)&quot; sold for $5.2 million, and his bronze sculpture &quot;Buffalo Hunt&quot; (which depicted two Native Americans attacking a running bison) sold for $4.1 million. In July 2009, Russell&#x27;s 1907 watercolor and gouache &quot;The Truce&quot; went for $2.03 million to an anonymous phone bidder. Russell&#x27;s 1911 by bronze sculpture, &quot;Bronc Twister&quot;, auctioned in 2008 for $805,000—far above the $300,000 pre-auction estimate.

In July 2011, the price of Russell&#x27;s work soared again. His 1892 oil painting &quot;Water for Camp&quot; (depicting Native American women dipping pots into a stream) and his 1924 watercolor &quot;A Dangerous Sport&quot; (in which two cowboys lasso a mountain lion) sold for nearly $1.5 million each.

A collection of 30 pieces of Russell&#x27;s art were sold for several million dollars at the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Art Auction (held in Reno, Nevada) in July 2014, setting new records for many pieces. Russell&#x27;s &quot;Trail of the Iron Horse&quot; watercolor (depicting a group of horseback Native Americans contemplating railroad track) sold for $1.9 million, while &quot;Dakota Chief&quot; (which depicts a young Lakota chieftain on horseback) was auctioned for $1.1 million (almost double the last price it commanded). Even small pencil sketches sold for $25,000.

== Notable works ==


Russell&#x27;s works comprised a wide variety of topics, including major historical events and everyday life in the west. His work was noted for the frequency with which he portrayed well-known events from the point of view of Native American people instead of the non-Native viewpoint. He was noted for a keen eye on the social undercurrents of society and the meticulous authenticity with which he portrayed the clothing and equipment of both cowboys and Native people.

Historians studying women&#x27;s roles in the West have critiqued Russell&#x27;s portrayal of women. They note the contrasting levels of sensuality in his depictions of white and native women, as he seemed to transfer sexuality from white to Native women, so as to conform to the moral standards and perceptions of women in his time. Most of Russell&#x27;s portrayals of white women are shown as &quot;pure&quot; and non-sexual, other than those paintings specifically depicting prostitutes. In contrast, his series of five &quot;Keeoma&quot; paintings and related images show a sensual native woman. They are documented by the statement that Keeoma was a real woman whom Russell had loved. Photographs exist that show the body model for these images was Russell&#x27;s wife, Nancy.

<doc id="340483" wikidata="Q1323029" url="?curid=340483" title="Minami Takayama">
<text>is a Japanese voice actress, narrator and singer who is currently affiliated with 81 Produce. She is also the main vocalist of Two-Mix and ES CONNEXION when it was active. Her uncle is a former New Japan Pro-Wrestling managing director Hisashi Shinma.

Takayama is best known for her roles in &quot;Detective Conan&quot; as Conan Edogawa, &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; as both Kiki and Ursula, &quot;Ranma ½&quot; as Nabiki Tendo, &quot;Moomin&quot; as Moomin, &quot;Yaiba&quot; as Yaiba Kurogane, &quot;Shaman King&quot; as Hao Asakura, &quot;Nintama Rantarō&quot; as Rantarō Inadera, &quot;Danganronpa&quot; series as Hajime Hinata/Izuru Kamukura, &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&quot; as Envy, and &quot;Honkai Impact 3rd&quot; as Fu Hua.

==Career==
From an early age, Takayama studied ballet, Japanese dance, and vocal music. When she was a child, her sense of justice was so strong that it was written on her report card. She wanted to become a police officer, which she thought she was suited for, and she thought that ventriloquism would be necessary for being a traffic safety guider, so she joined Himawari Theatre Group in 1978 when she was in junior high school, and stayed there for four years. In reality, however, Takayama&#x27;s parents wanted her to enter the entertainment industry, and she felt as if she was being forced to follow the rails laid out for her, and the ventriloquism was just a reason for her to study acting, not something she came up with. When she was in high school, she won a radio disc jockey contest and thought about becoming a DJ because of her love of radio and fascination with free banter and voice work.

After graduating from Adachi Nishi High School in Tokyo, not knowing how to become a DJ, Takayama enrolled in the theater department of Nihon Kogakuin College to continue her acting career, but she became worried about her future and dropped out to stop acting altogether. At one point, she was working at an office, but when a caller praised her voice, she decided to become a voice actor at the age of 22. In 1985, she joined the voice acting division of Sun House Music, but after that, she met a manager who asked her if she wanted to work as a voice actress, and she joined 81 Produce, where she was told that if she didn&#x27;t make any progress in two of her three years as a rookie, she should give up. She decided to try to bear fruit in one year.

Initially, Takayama auditioned for the role of the heroine, but even though she tried to read the lines in a cute way, she was told by different sound directors to &quot;be more like a girl.&quot; After failing three times in a row, she consulted with her manager and decided to audition for the role of a boy, thinking that heroine might not be suitable for her. She made her debut in 1987 as a female student in &quot;Campus Special Investigator Hikaruon&quot;. After that, she started getting boy roles and got her first starring role as Youichi Ajiyoshi in &quot;Mister Ajikko&quot; the third time around.

In 1989, she was chosen to play both Kiki and Ursula in the animated film &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;, and the film was a hit. She tried to refuse the role because it was decided at short notice and she was too new to take responsibility, but Hayao Miyazaki told her not to worry because he would take responsibility. Despite this, there was a time when the only regular role she played was Nabiki Tendo in the &quot;Ranma ½&quot; series, which depressed her, but she pulled herself together and started working part-time in her neighborhood. In the 1990s, she began to play the main and major characters in many works, mainly boys, such as &quot;Moomin&quot; (as Moomin), &quot;Magical Taruruto-kun&quot; (as Honmaru Edojō), and &quot;Yaiba&quot; (as Yaiba), and her popularity became firmly established. In particular, her leading roles as Rantarō Inadera in &quot;Nintama Rantarō&quot; and Conan Edogawa in &quot;Detective Conan&quot; have lasted for more than 20 years since they were first broadcast in 1993 and 1996, respectively, and Takayama&#x27;s voice has become recognized by a wide range of generations. In 2005, she was chosen to play Suneo&#x27;s mom in the renewed &quot;Doraemon&quot; anime, in 2007 she voiced Kitarō in the fifth series of &quot;GeGeGe no Kitarō&quot;, and in 2010 she voiced Taiki Kudō in &quot;Digimon Fusion&quot;.

Takayama is also active in music as ES CONNEXION, Two-Mix, Miru Takayama with TWO-MIX, and M★TWO-MinaMiru-, a unit with her cousin Miru Takayama. She has sung the theme songs of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;, and has also composed music. In the 81st episode of &quot;Detective Conan&quot; (broadcast on November 17, 1997), she appeared as a character with Shiina Nagano as TWO-MIX themselves, and also sang the opening theme song for the anime. In addition, in 2005, she brought in Joe Rinoie to work on the theme song for the anime &quot;Engage Planet Kiss Dum&quot; in 2007 as the unit II MIX⊿DELTA.

In 2011, Takayama won the Synergy Award at the 5th Seiyu Awards. On January 9, 2017, she was picked 7th in the TV Asahi 3-hour special that voted 200 popular voice actors.

Takayama was married to manga artist Gosho Aoyama on May 5, 2005 but they divorced on December 10, 2007. However, their relationship as &quot;the author of the original story of &quot;Detective Conan&quot; and the lead voice actress&quot; has continued to be good, and they are not estranged even now. Takayama has been keeping Aoyama&#x27;s cat, Kite, which was given to her at the time of marriage, and she reports on Kite&#x27;s good health on her blog.

During the opening speech of &quot;Detective Conan: Quarter of Silence&quot; an earthquake of magnitude 4 struck the stage. Takayama made a quick decision and said in Conan&#x27;s voice, &quot;Calm down, earthquakes! Don&#x27;t worry, Conan is here.&quot; to calm the children.

<text>A free kick is an action used in several codes of football to restart play with the kicking of a ball into the field of play.

== Association football ==

In association football, the free kick is a method of restarting the game following an offence by the opposing side. 

For more serious offences, such as handball or serious foul play, a direct free kick is awarded, from which a goal may be scored directly against the opposing side. (If such an offence is committed in a team&#x27;s own penalty area, a penalty kick is awarded instead). 

For less serious offences, such as offside, an indirect free kick is awarded, from which the ball must touch another player before a goal is scored. 

== Gridiron football ==
In American football, after a safety is scored, the ball is put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In professional play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee can be used in high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.

In Canadian football, after scoring a safety touch, the scoring team has the option of taking control of the ball and beginning play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.

Another example occurring in American football is the fair catch kick, a field goal attempted freely from the spot of a fair catch. Although the National Football League (NFL) does not consider the play a free kick, the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) and media analysts regard it as being a free kick. The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick, and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the defensive team&#x27;s goal, a field goal, worth three points, is scored to the offensive team.

Under NFHS rules, kickoffs are also classified as free kicks.

==Australian rules football==
A free kick in Australian rules football is awarded after a player commits a penalty. The player must then kick the ball back to the other team. When a free kick is awarded, the player&#x27;s opponent &quot;stands the mark&quot;, standing on the spot where the umpire indicates that the free kick was paid or mark was taken. The player with the ball then retreats backwards so that the ball can be kicked over the player standing the mark; the player must retreat on the angle such that he, the man on the mark and the centre of the attacking goal are in the same straight line.

==Rugby union==
A free kick in rugby union is usually awarded to a team for a technical offence committed by the opposing side. Once awarded a free kick, the team must decide how they wish to play it. Options include choosing to play a place kick, drop kick, punt, or take it as a scrum.

<doc id="340492" wikidata="Q149397" url="?curid=340492" title="Vaccinium macrocarpon">
<text>Vaccinium macrocarpon, also called large cranberry, American cranberry and bearberry, is a North American species of cranberry in the subgenus &quot;Oxycoccus&quot;.

The name cranberry comes from shape of the flower stamen, which looks like a crane&#x27;s beak.

==Description==

&quot;Vaccinium macrocarpon&quot; is a perennial shrub, often ascending (trailing along the surface of the ground for some distance but then curving upwards). The leaf blades are abaxially glaucous and green adaxially. The leaf blades are long, narrowly elliptic to elliptic, and in rare cases oblong.

The pedicels are nodding and slender, measuring . It produces white or pink flowers with four petals, followed by sour-tasting red or pink berries across.

==Distribution==
&quot;Vaccinium macrocarpon&quot; is native to central and eastern Canada (Ontario to Newfoundland) and the northeastern and north-central United States (Northeast, Great Lakes Region, and Appalachians as far south as North Carolina and Tennessee). It is also naturalized in parts of Europe and scattered locations in North America along western Canada (British Columbia) and the western U.S. (West Coast).

== Uses ==
The berries are edible, for which the species is grown commercially as a cash crop. Many cranberries are grown in wetland soils consisting of alternating layers of organic matter and sand; modern harvesting techniques include temporarily flooding fields, shaking berries loose, and gathering the floating berries. Common uses of the berries includes sauce, jelly, juice, and dried fruit. There is some evidence suggesting that the berries or their juice could be useful in treating or preventing certain urinary tract infections, but this is not certain yet and thus is not substitute for medical management. Some research suggests cranberries may suppress asymptomatic &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; colonization, but they seem to be an inferior treatment compared to antibiotic therapy in symptomatic patients.

<doc id="340496" wikidata="Q3847695" url="?curid=340496" title="Cooties">
<text>Cooties is a fictitious childhood disease, commonly represented as childlore. It is used in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines as a rejection term and an infection tag game (such as Humans vs. Zombies). It is similar to the British &quot;dreaded lurgi&quot;, and to terms used in the Nordic countries, in Italy, India and Iraq. A child is said to &quot;catch&quot; cooties through close contact with an &quot;infected&quot; person or from an opposite-sex child of a similar age.

==Origin==
The word is thought to originate from the Austronesian language family, in which the Philippine, Malaysian-Indonesian, and Māori languages have the word &quot;kuto&quot; or &quot;kutu&quot; for a parasitic biting insect. However, it is equally likely the name originated from &quot;cuties&quot;, a cynical reference to the same. The earliest recorded uses of the term in English are by British soldiers during the First World War to refer to lice that proliferated in battlefield trenches.

A hand-held game, the &quot;Cootie Game&quot;, was made by the Irvin-Smith Company of Chicago in 1915; it involved tilting capsules (the cooties) into a trap over a background illustration depicting a battlefield. Other cootie games followed, all involving some form of &quot;bug&quot; or &quot;cootie&quot;, until &quot;The Game of Cootie&quot; was launched in 1948 by Schaper Toys. This game was very successful, becoming an icon; in 2003, the Toy Industry Association included it on its &quot;Century of Toys List&quot; of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.

In addition to the cooties games, the term &quot;cooties&quot; was popularised in America in the 1950s by military personnel coming back from service alongside the British in the South Pacific. Like the British &#x27;dreaded lurgi&#x27;, the cooties games developed during the early 1950s polio epidemic, and became associated with dirt and contagion.

==Other terms==
The lice of the First World War trenches nicknamed &quot;cooties&quot; were also known as &quot;arithmetic bugs&quot; because &quot;they added to our troubles, subtracted from our pleasures, divided our attention, and multiplied like hell.&quot;

In Italy, children have the term &quot;la peste&quot; (&quot;the plague&quot;). Cooties are known in Denmark as &quot;pigelus&quot; and &quot;drengelus&quot; and in Norway as &quot;jentelus&quot; and &quot;guttelus&quot;: each pair meaning literally &quot;girl lice&quot; and &quot;boy lice&quot;. In Sweden they are known as &quot;tjejbaciller&quot; and &quot;killbaciller&quot; (literally &quot;girl/boy bacilli&quot;) and in Finland they are known as the &quot;tyttöbakteeri&quot; and &quot;poikabakteeri&quot; (&quot;girl/boy bacteria&quot;). In Serbia the game is known as &quot;šuga&quot;; the word means scabies.

==Cooties game==
A child is said to &quot;catch&quot; cooties through any form of bodily contact, proximity, or touching of an &quot;infected&quot; person or from a person of the opposite sex of the same age. Often the &quot;infected&quot; person is someone who is perceived as different, due to disability, shyness, being of the opposite sex, or having peculiar mannerisms. The phrase is most commonly used by children in elementary school aged from four to ten; however, it may be used by older children in a sarcastic or playful way.

In the United States, children sometimes &quot;immunize&quot; one another from cooties by administering a &quot;cootie(s) shot&quot;. Typically, one child administers the &quot;shot&quot;, using an index finger to trace circles and dots on another child&#x27;s forearm while reciting the rhyme, &quot;Circle, circle, Dot, dot, – Now you&#x27;ve got the cootie shot!&quot; In some variations, a child then says, &quot;Circle, circle, Square, square, – Now you have it everywhere!&quot; In this case, the child receives an immunization throughout their body. These variations may continue to a final shot where the child says, &quot;Circle, circle, Knife, knife, – Now you&#x27;ve got it all your life!&quot;. A number of other variations exist.

<text>The Ionians (; , &quot;Íōnes&quot;, singular , &quot;Íōn&quot;) were one of the traditional four major tribes of Ancient Greece, alongside the Dorians, Aeolians, and Achaeans. The Ionian dialect was one of the three major linguistic divisions of the Hellenic world, together with the Dorian and Aeolian dialects.

When referring to populations, &quot;Ionian&quot; defines several groups in Classical Greece. In its narrowest sense, the term referred to the region of Ionia in Asia Minor. In a broader sense, it could be used to describe all speakers of the Ionic dialect, which in addition to those in Ionia proper also included the Greek populations of Euboea, the Cyclades, and many cities founded by Ionian colonists. Finally, in the broadest sense it could be used to describe all those who spoke languages of the East Greek group, which included Attic.

The foundation myth which was current in the Classical period suggested that the Ionians were named after Ion, son of Xuthus, who lived in the north Peloponnesian region of Aigialeia. When the Dorians invaded the Peloponnese they expelled the Achaeans from the Argolid and Lacedaemonia. The displaced Achaeans moved into Aigialeia (thereafter known as Achaea), in turn expelling the Ionians from Aigialeia. The Ionians moved to Attica and mingled with the local population of Attica, and many years later emigrated to the coast of Asia Minor founding the historical region of Ionia. 

Unlike the austere and militaristic Dorians, the Ionians are renowned for their love of philosophy, art, democracy, and pleasure – Ionian traits that were most famously expressed by the Athenians. The Ionian school of philosophy, centered on Miletus, was characterized by a focus on non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena and a search for rational explanations of the universe, thereby laying the foundation for scientific inquiry and rational thought in Western philosophy.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the word or is uncertain. Frisk isolates an unknown root, &quot;*Ia-&quot;, pronounced &quot;*ya-&quot;. There are, however, some theories:

* From a Proto-Indo-European onomatopoeic root &quot;*wi-&quot; or &quot;*woi-&quot; expressing a shout uttered by persons running to the assistance of others; according to Pokorny, &quot;*Iāwones&quot; could mean &quot;devotees of Apollo&quot;, based on the cry &quot;iḕ paiṓn&quot; uttered in his worship; the god was also called &quot;iḕios&quot; himself.
* From an unknown early name of an eastern Mediterranean island population represented by &quot;&quot;, an ancient Egyptian name for the people living there.
* From a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*uiH-&quot;, meaning &quot;power.&quot;

== History of the name ==
Unlike &quot;Aeolians&quot; and &quot;Dorians&quot;, &quot;Ionians&quot; appears in the languages of different civilizations around the eastern Mediterranean and as far east as Han China. They are not the earliest Greeks to appear in the records; that distinction belongs to the Danaans and the Achaeans. The trail of the Ionians begins in the Mycenaean Greek records of Crete.

=== Mycenaean ===
A fragmentary Linear B tablet from Knossos (tablet Xd 146) bears the name &quot;i-ja-wo-ne&quot;, interpreted by Ventris and Chadwick as possibly the dative or nominative plural case of *Iāwones, an ethnic name. The Knossos tablets are dated to 1400 or 1200 B.C. and thus pre-date the Dorian dominance in Crete, if the name refers to Cretans.

The name first appears in Greek literature in Homer as , &quot;iāones&quot;, used on a single occasion of some long-robed Greeks attacked by Hector and apparently identified with Athenians, and this Homeric form appears to be identical with the Mycenaean form but without the *-w-. This name also appears in a fragment of the other early poet, Hesiod, in the singular , &quot;iāōn&quot;.

=== Biblical ===
In the Book of Genesis of the English Bible, Javan, known in Hebrew as &quot;Yāwān&quot; and in plural &quot;Yəwānīm&quot;, is a son of Japheth. Javan, meaning &#x27;Greek&#x27;, is believed nearly universally by Bible scholars to represent the Ionians, corresponding to the Greek Ion, and to serve as a name for the Greeks and Macedonians. The term is also found in other ancient literature; the &quot;Yevana&quot; (Ionians) aligned with the Hittites against Egypt, while the &quot;Yauna&quot; of the Persian records corresponds to the Ionians of Asia Minor.

Additionally, though less surely, Japheth may be related linguistically to the Greek mythological figure Iapetus. The locations of the biblical tribal countries have been the subjects of centuries of scholarship and yet remain open questions to various degrees. The final chapter of the Book of Isaiah, who lived in the 8th century BC, contains what may be a hint by listing &quot;the nations ... that have not heard my fame&quot; including Javan immediately after &quot;the isles afar off&quot;. These isles may be considered as an apposition to Javan or the last item in the series. If the former, the expression is typically used of the population of the islands in the Aegean Sea.

=== Assyrian ===
Some letters of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BC record attacks by what appear to be Ionians on the cities of Phoenicia:For example, a raid by the Ionians (&quot;ia-u-na-a-a&quot;) on the Phoenician coast is reported to Tiglath-Pileser III in a letter from the 730s BC discovered at Nimrud.

The Assyrian word, which is preceded by the country determinative, has been reconstructed as *Iaunaia. More common is ia-a-ma-nu, ia-ma-nu and ia-am-na-a-a with the country determinative, reconstructed as Iamānu. Sargon II related that he took the latter from the sea like fish and that they were from &quot;the sea of the setting sun.&quot; If the identification of Assyrian names is correct, at least some of the Ionian marauders came from Cyprus:Sargon&#x27;s Annals for 709, claiming that tribute was sent to him by &#x27;seven kings of Ya (ya-a&#x27;), a district of Yadnana whose distant abodes are situated a seven-days&#x27; journey in the sea of the setting sun&#x27;, is confirmed by a stele set up at Citium in Cyprus &#x27;at the base of a mountain ravine ... of Yadnana.&#x27;

=== Iranian ===
Ionians appear in a number of Old Persian inscriptions of the Achaemenid Empire as &quot;Yaunā&quot; (), a nominative plural masculine, singular Yauna; for example, an inscription of Darius on the south wall of the palace at Persepolis includes in the provinces of the empire &quot;Ionians who are of the mainland and (those) who are by the sea, and countries which are across the sea; ...&quot; At that time the empire probably extended around the Aegean to northern Greece.

=== Indic ===

Inspired by Achaemenid Iranians, Ionians appear in Indic literature and documents as Yavana and Yona. In documents, these names refer to the Indo-Greek Kingdoms: the states formed by the Macedonian Alexander the Great and his successors on the Indian subcontinent. The earliest such documentation is the Edicts of Ashoka. The Thirteenth Edict is dated to 260–258 BC and directly refers to the &quot;Yonas&quot;.

=== Chinese ===

Dayuan&#x27; (or Tayuan; ; Middle Chinese &quot;dâiC-jwɐn&quot; &lt; LHC: &quot;dɑh-ʔyɑn&quot;) is the Chinese exonym for a country that existed in Ferghana valley in Central Asia, described in the Chinese historical works of &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; and the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. It is mentioned in the accounts of the Chinese explorer Zhang Qian in 130 BCE and the numerous embassies that followed him into Central Asia. The country of Dayuan is generally accepted as relating to the Ferghana Valley, controlled by the Hellenistic polis Alexandria Eschate (modern Khujand, Tajikistan), which can probably be understood as &quot;Greco-Fergana city-state&quot; in English language.

=== Other languages ===
Most modern Western Asian languages use the terms &quot;Ionia&quot; and &quot;Ionian&quot; to refer to Greece and Greeks. That is true of Hebrew (Yavan &#x27;Greece&#x27; / Yevani fem. Yevania &#x27;a Greek&#x27;), Armenian (Hunastan &#x27;Greece&#x27; / Huyn &#x27;a Greek&#x27;), and the Classical Arabic words (al-Yūnān &#x27;Greece&#x27; / Yūnānī fem. Yūnāniyya pl. Yūnān &#x27;a Greek&#x27;, probably from Aramaic Yawnānā) are used in most modern Arabic dialects including Egyptian and Palestinian as well as being used in modern Persian (Yūnānestān &#x27;Greece&#x27; / Yūnānī pl. Yūnānīhā/Yūnānīyān &#x27;Greeks&#x27;) and Turkish too via Persian (Yunanistan &#x27;Greece&#x27; / Yunan &#x27;a Greek person&#x27; pl. Yunanlar &#x27;Greek people&#x27;).

== Ionic language ==
Ionic Greek was a subdialect of the Attic–Ionic or Eastern dialect group of Ancient Greek. The Ionic group traditionally comprises three dialectal varieties that were spoken in Euboea (West Ionic), the northern Cyclades (Central Ionic), and from c. 1000 BC onward in Asiatic Ionia (East Ionic), where Ionian colonists from Athens founded their cities. Ionic was the base of several literary language forms of the Archaic and Classical periods, both in poetry and prose. The works of Homer (&quot;The Iliad&quot;, &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, Homeric Hymns) and of Hesiod were written in a literary form of the Ionic dialect called Homeric Greek or Epic Greek. Ionic was eventually supplanted by the Attic dialect which had become the dominant dialect of the Greek world by the 5th century BC.

== Pre-Ionic Ionians ==
The literary evidence of the Ionians leads back to mainland Greece in Mycenaean times before there was an Ionia. The classical sources seem determined that they were to be called Ionians along with other names even then. This cannot be documented with inscriptional evidence, and yet the literary evidence, which is manifestly at least partially legendary, seems to reflect a general verbal tradition.

=== Herodotus ===

Herodotus of Halicarnassus asserts:all are Ionians who are of Athenian descent and keep the feast Apaturia.
He further explains:The whole Hellenic stock was then small, and the last of all its branches and the least regarded was the Ionian; for it had no considerable city except Athens.
The Ionians spread from Athens to other places in the Aegean Sea: Sifnos and Serifos, Naxos, Kea and Samos. But they were not just from Athens:These Ionians, as long as they were in the Peloponnesus, dwelt in what is now called Achaea, and before Danaus and Xuthus came to the Peloponnesus, as the Greeks say, they were called Aegialian Pelasgians. They were named Ionians after Ion the son of Xuthus.
Achaea was divided into 12 communities originally Ionian: Pellene, Aegira, Aegae, Bura, Helice, Aegion, Rhype, Patrae, Phareae, Olenus, Dyme and Tritaeae. The most aboriginal Ionians were of Cynuria:The Cynurians are aboriginal and seem to be the only Ionians, but they have been Dorianized by time and by Argive rule.

=== Strabo ===
In Strabo&#x27;s account of the origin of the Ionians, Hellen, son of Deucalion, ancestor of the Hellenes, king of Phthia, arranged a marriage between his son Xuthus and the daughter of king Erechtheus of Athens. Xuthus then founded the Tetrapolis (&quot;Four Cities&quot;) of Attica, a rural district. His son, Achaeus, went into exile in a land subsequently called Achaea after him. Another son of Xuthus, Ion, conquered Thrace, after which the Athenians made him king of Athens. Attica was called Ionia after his death. Those Ionians colonized Aigialia changing its name to Ionia also. When the Heracleidae returned the Achaeans drove the Ionians back to Athens. Under the Codridae they set forth for Anatolia and founded 12 cities in Caria and Lydia following the model of the 12 cities of Achaea, formerly Ionian.

== Ionian School of philosophy ==

During the 6th century BC, Ionian coastal towns, such as Miletus and Ephesus, became the focus of a revolution in traditional thinking about Nature. Instead of explaining natural phenomena by recourse to traditional religion/myth, the cultural climate was such that men began to form hypotheses about the natural world based on ideas gained from both personal experience and deep reflection. These men—Thales and his successors—were called &quot;physiologoi&quot;, those who discoursed on Nature. They were skeptical of religious explanations for natural phenomena and instead sought purely mechanical and physical explanations. They are credited as being of critical importance to the development of the &#x27;scientific attitude&#x27; towards the study of Nature. According to physicist Carlo Rovelli, the work of the Ionian school produced the &quot;first great scientific revolution&quot; and the earliest example of critical thinking, which would come to define Greek, and subsequently modern, thought.

<text>The Greek Dark Ages ( 1180–800 BC) were earlier regarded as two continuous periods of Greek history: the Postpalatial Bronze Age (c. 1180–1050 BC) and the Prehistoric Iron Age or Early Iron Age (c. 1050–800 BC). The last included all the ceramic phases from the Protogeometric to the Middle Geometric and lasted until the beginning of the Historic Iron Age around 800 BC. Currently, the term Greek Dark Ages is being abandoned, and both periods are not considered &quot;obscure&quot;.

At the beginning of the Postpalatial Bronze Age, the so-called Late Bronze Age collapse of civilization in the Eastern Mediterranean world in c. 1200–1150 BC took place, as the great palaces and cities of the Mycenaeans were destroyed or abandoned. At around the same time, the Hittite civilization also suffered serious disruption, with cities from Troy to Gaza being destroyed. In Egypt, the New Kingdom fell into disarray, leading to the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt. Following the collapse, there were fewer, smaller settlements, suggesting widespread famine and depopulation. In Greece, the Linear B script used by Mycenaean bureaucrats to write the Greek language ceased to be used, and the Greek alphabet did not develop until the beginning of the Protohistoric Iron Age, c. 800 BC.

== Postpalatial Bronze Age ==
Mycenaean palaces began to come to an end around 1200 BC, and the process concluded decades later, due to internal tensions within the cities which rejected palatial authority and administration, patent in the disappearance of Linear B writing and palatial architecture. There were also conflicts, in the region of Boeotia, between Mycenaean polities like Orchomenos, Gla, and Thebes. Although Thebes and Eleon had an important reoccupation pattern even in Late Helladic IIIC Middle, c. 1170–1100 BC, when other minor sites around also began to rise, palaces had ceased to exist along with art and burial customs. 

On the other hand, in the island of Euboea, the site of Lefkandi grew up in an accelerated way in this Postpalatial period (1200–1050 BC) to become a preeminent place as it has a double bay with sea traffic. Additionally, evidence had emerged of the new presence of Hellenes in sub-Mycenaean Cyprus (c. 1100–1050 BC) and on the Syrian coast at Al-Mina. However, Greek-speaking people arrived in Cyprus, in the late 13th to 11th centuries BC, but did not colonize the island, they integrated into society as &quot;economic and cultural migrants from the periphery to the core.&quot;

== Early Iron Age ==
There were four centres in the following Prehistoric or Early Iron Age (1050–800 BC), with more than 1000 individuals: Lefkandi, Athens, Argos, and Knossos, which also featured sociopolitical complexity, hierarchies manifested locally though not in a wider area. The decoration on Greek pottery after about 1050 BC lacks the figurative decoration of Mycenaean ware and is restricted to simpler, generally geometric styles: Early Protogeometric (1050–1000 BC), Middle Protogeometric (1000–950 BC), Late Protogeometric (950 BC - 900 BC), Early Geometric (900 BC - 850 BC), and Middle Geometric (850–800 BC). Thomas R. Martin, considers that between 950 BC and 750 BC, the Greeks relearned how to write, but using the alphabet of the Phoenicians instead of the Linear B script used by the Mycenaeans, innovating in a fundamental way by introducing vowels as letters. &quot;The Greek version of the alphabet eventually formed the base of the alphabet used for English today.&quot;

It was previously thought that all contact was lost between mainland Hellenes and foreign powers during this period, yielding little cultural progress or growth. But archaeologist Alex Knodell considers that artifacts, in the Early Iron Age, from excavations at Lefkandi on the Lelantine Plain in the island of Euboea in the 1980s &quot;revealed that some parts of Greece were much wealthier and more widely connected than traditionally thought, as a monumental building and its adjacent cemetery showed connections to Cyprus, Egypt, and the Levant as markers of elite status and authority, much as they had been in previous periods,&quot; and this shows that significant cultural and trade links with the east, particularly the Levant coast, developed from c. 900 BC onwards. 

Though life was harsh for the Greeks of the Dark Ages, and one major result of the period was the deconstruction of the old Mycenaean economic and social structures, along with the strict class hierarchies and hereditary rule forgotten, a gradual replacement with new socio-political institutions eventually allowed for the rise of democracy in 5th century BC Athens. Notable events after the Dark Ages period that mark the transition to Classical Antiquity include the first Olympics, in 776 BC, and the composition of the Homeric epics the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

== Mediterranean warfare and Sea Peoples ==
The fall of Mycenaeans in the Bronze Age collapse was attributed to a Dorian or Sea Peoples invasion, but Sea Peoples could have been pirate bands which coalesced due to the collapse, and diverse in origin, like sailors, workers, or mercenaries, coming from ethnicities like those of the Lukka lands, but not necessarily or exclusively Achaeans (Ekwesh).

Around this time, c. 1200–1150 BC, large-scale revolts took place in several parts of the eastern Mediterranean. Writing in 2013, Jonathan Hall considered that: &quot;[T]he collapse of the political and economic system centered on the Mycenaean palaces provoked a climate of instability and insecurity and [s]ome people – whether for reasons of safety or economic necessity – decided to abandon their former homes and seek a living elsewhere.&quot;

==Culture==
With the collapse of the palatial centers, no more monumental stone buildings were built, and the practice of wall painting may have ceased. Writing in the Linear B script also ceased, and vital trade links were lost as towns and villages were abandoned. Writing in the Linear B script ended particularly due to the redistributive palace economy crashing; there was no longer a need to keep records about commerce. The population of Greece declined. The world of organized state armies, kings, officials, and redistributive systems disappeared. Most of the information about the period comes from burial sites and the grave goods contained within them.

The emerging fragmented, localized, and autonomous cultures lacked cultural and aesthetic cohesion and are noted for their diversity of material cultures in pottery styles (e.g. conservative in Athens, eclectic in Knossos), burial practices, and settlement structures. The Protogeometric style of pottery was stylistically simpler than earlier designs, characterized by lines and curves. On the other hand, generalizations about the &quot;Dark Age Society&quot; are considered simplifications, because the range of cultures throughout Greece at the time cannot be grouped into a single &quot;Dark Age Society&quot; category. 

Tholos tombs are found in Early Iron Age Thessaly and in Crete but not in general elsewhere, and cremation was the dominant rite in Attica but nearby in the Argolid, it was inhumation. Some former sites of Mycenaean palaces, such as Argos or Knossos, continued to be occupied; the fact that other sites experienced an expansive &quot;boom time&quot; of a generation or two before they were abandoned has been associated by James Whitley with the &quot;big-man social organization&quot;, which is based on personal charisma and is inherently unstable: he interprets Lefkandi in this light.

Some regions in Greece, such as Attica, Euboea, and central Crete, recovered economically from these events faster than others, but life for common Greeks would have remained relatively unchanged as it had for centuries. There was still farming, weaving, metalworking and pottery but at a lower level of output and for local use in local styles. Some technical innovations were introduced around 1050 BC with the start of the Protogeometric style (1050 BC – 900 BC), such as the superior pottery technology that included a faster potter&#x27;s wheel for superior vase shapes and the use of a compass to draw perfect circles and semicircles for decoration. Better glazes were achieved by higher temperature firing of the clay. However, the overall trend was toward simpler, less intricate pieces and fewer resources being devoted to the creation of beautiful art.

The smelting of iron was learned from Cyprus and the Levant and was exploited and improved upon by using local deposits of iron ore previously ignored by the Mycenaeans: edged weapons were now within reach of less elite warriors. Though the universal use of iron was one shared feature among Dark Age settlements, it is still uncertain when the forged iron weapons and armour achieved strength superior to those that had previously been cast and hammered from bronze. From 1050, many small local iron industries appeared, and by 900, almost all weapons in grave goods were made of iron.

The distribution of the Ionic Greek dialect in historic times indicates early movement from mainland Greece to the Anatolian coast to such sites as Miletus, Ephesus, and Colophon, perhaps as early as 1000 BC, but contemporaneous evidence is scant. In Cyprus, some archaeological sites begin to show identifiably Greek ceramics; a colony of Euboean Greeks was established at Al Mina on the Syrian coast, and the revival of an Aegean Greek network of exchange can be detected from 10th-century BC Attic Proto-geometric pottery found in Crete and at Samos, off the coast of Asia Minor.

Religion in the Greek Dark Ages is seen to be a continuation of Bronze Age Greek Religion, specifically the ideas of Hero worship, and how the gods&#x27; powers were attributed.

==Post-Mycenaean Cyprus==

Cyprus was inhabited by a mix of &quot;Pelasgians&quot; and Phoenicians, joined during this period by the first Greek settlements. Potters in Cyprus initiated the most elegant new pottery style of the 10th and 9th centuries, the &quot;Cypro-Phoenician&quot; &quot;black on red&quot; style of small flasks and jugs that held precious contents, probably scented oil. Together with distinctively Greek Euboean ceramic wares, it was widely exported and is found in Levantine sites, including Tyre and far inland in the late 11th and 10th centuries. Cypriot metalwork was exchanged in Crete.

==Society==
Greece during this period was likely divided into independent regions organized by kinship groups and the &quot;oikoi&quot; or households, the origins of the later &quot;poleis&quot;. Most Greeks did not live in isolated farmsteads but in small settlements. It is likely that at the dawn of the historical period two or three hundred years later, the main economic resource for each family was the ancestral plot of land of the &quot;Oikos&quot;, the &quot;kleros&quot; or allotment. Without this, a man could not marry.

Excavations of Dark Age communities such as Nichoria in the Peloponnese have shown how a Bronze Age town was abandoned in 1150 BC but then reemerged as a small village cluster by 1075 BC. At this time there were only around forty families living there with plenty of good farming land and grazing for cattle. The remains of a 10th century BC building, including a megaron, on the top of the ridge has led to speculation that this was the chieftain&#x27;s house. This was a larger structure than those surrounding it but it was still made from the same materials (mud brick and thatched roof). It was perhaps also a place of religious significance and communal storage of food. High-status individuals did in fact exist in the Dark Age, but their standard of living was not significantly higher than others of their village.

==Lefkandi burial==
Lefkandi on the island of Euboea was a prosperous settlement in the Late Bronze Age, possibly to be identified with old Eretria. It recovered quickly from the collapse of Mycenaean culture, and in 1981 excavators of a burial ground found the largest 10th century BC building yet known from Greece. Sometimes called &quot;the &quot;heroon&quot;&quot;, this long narrow building, 50 metres by 10 metres, or about 164 feet by 33 feet, contained two burial shafts. In one were placed four horses and the other contained a cremated male buried with his iron weapons and an inhumed woman, heavily adorned with gold jewellery. 

The man&#x27;s bones were placed in a bronze jar from Cyprus, with hunting scenes on the cast rim. The woman was clad with gold coils in her hair, rings, gold breastplates, an heirloom necklace, an elaborate Cypriot or Near Eastern necklace made some 200 to 300 years before her burial, and an ivory-handled dagger at her head. The horses appeared to have been sacrificed, some appearing to have iron bits in their mouths. No evidence survives to show whether the building was erected to house the burial, or whether the &quot;hero&quot; or local chieftain in the grave was cremated and then buried in his grand house; whichever is true, the house was soon demolished and the debris used to form a roughly circular mound over the wall stumps.

Between this period and approximately 820 BC, rich members of the community were cremated and buried close to the eastern end of the building, in much the same way Christians might seek to be buried close to a saint&#x27;s grave; the presence of imported objects, notable throughout more than eighty further burials, contrast with other nearby cemeteries at Lefkandi and attest to a lasting elite tradition.

==End==

The archaeological record of many sites demonstrates that the economic recovery of Greece was well underway by the beginning of the 8th century  BC. Cemeteries, such as the Kerameikos in Athens or Lefkandi, and sanctuaries, such as Olympia, recently founded in Delphi or the Heraion of Samos, first of the colossal free-standing temples, were richly provided with offerings – including items from the Near East, Egypt, and Italy made of exotic materials including amber and ivory. Exports of Greek pottery demonstrate contact with the Levant coast at sites such as Al-Mina and with the region of the Villanovan culture to the north of Rome.

The decoration of pottery became more elaborate and included figured scenes that parallel the stories of Homeric Epic. Iron tools and weapons improved. Renewed Mediterranean trade brought new supplies of copper and tin to make a wide range of elaborate bronze objects, such as tripod stands like those offered as prizes in the funeral games celebrated by Achilles for Patroclus. Other coastal regions of Greece besides Euboea were once again full participants in the commercial and cultural exchanges of the eastern and central Mediterranean and communities developed governance by an elite group of aristocrats, rather than by the single &quot;basileus&quot; or chieftain of earlier periods.

==New writing system==
By the beginning of 8th century BC, a new Greek alphabet system was adopted from the Phoenician alphabet by a Greek with first-hand experience of it. The Greeks adapted the abjad used to write Phoenician, a Semitic language used by the Phoenicians, notably introducing characters for vowel sounds and thereby creating the first truly alphabetic writing system. The new alphabet quickly spread throughout the Mediterranean and was used to write not only the Greek language but also Phrygian and other languages in the eastern Mediterranean. As Greece sent out colonies west towards Sicily and Italy (Pithekoussae, Cumae), the influence of their new alphabet extended further. 

The ceramic Euboean artifact inscribed with a few lines written in the Greek alphabet referring to &quot;Nestor&#x27;s Cup&quot;, discovered in a grave at Pithekoussae (Ischia), dates from c. 730 BC. It seems to be the oldest written reference to the &quot;Iliad&quot;. The Etruscans benefited from the innovation: Old Italic variants spread throughout Italy from the 8th century. Other variants of the alphabet appear on the Lemnos Stele and in the alphabets of Asia Minor. The previous Linear scripts were not completely abandoned: the Cypriot syllabary, descended from Linear A, remained in use on Cyprus in Arcadocypriot Greek and Eteocypriot inscriptions until the Hellenistic era.

==Continuity thesis==
Some scholars have argued against the concept of a Greek Dark Age, on grounds that the former lack of archaeological evidence in a period that was mute in its lack of inscriptions (thus &quot;dark&quot;) is an accident of discovery rather than a fact of history. As James Whitley has put it, &quot;The Dark Age of Greece is our conception. It is a conception strongly coloured by our knowledge of the two literate civilisations that preceded and succeeded it: the bureaucratic, palace-centred world of Mycenaean Greece and the chaotic and creative Archaic age of Hellenic civilisation.&quot;

<text>The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 is a series of five-abreast single-aisle airliners developed by McDonnell Douglas. It was produced by the developer company until August 1997 and then by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The MD-80 was the second generation of the DC-9 family, originally designated as the DC-9-80 (DC-9 Series 80) and later stylized as the DC-9 Super 80 (short &quot;Super 80&quot;).

Stretched, enlarged wing and powered by higher bypass Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-200 engines, the aircraft program was launched in October 1977.
The MD-80 made its first flight on October 18, 1979, and was certified on August 25, 1980. The first airliner was delivered to launch customer Swissair on September 13, 1980, which introduced it into service on October 10, 1980.
Keeping the fuselage cross-section, longer variants are stretched by 14 ft (4.3 m) from the DC-9-50 and have a 28% larger wing.

The larger variants (MD-81/82/83/88) are 148 ft (45.1 m) long to seat 155 passengers in coach and, with varying weights, can cover up to .
The later MD-88 has a modern cockpit with EFIS displays.
The MD-87 is 17 ft (5.3 m) shorter for 130 passengers in economy and has a range up to .
The MD-80 series initially competed with the Boeing 737 Classic and then also with the Airbus A320ceo family. Its successor, introduced in 1995, the MD-90, was a further stretch powered by IAE V2500 high-bypass turbofans, while the shorter MD-95, later known as the Boeing 717, was powered by Rolls-Royce BR715 engines.
Production ended in 1999 after 1,191 MD-80s were delivered, of which 116 aircraft remain in service as of August 2022.

==Development==
The DC-9 series, the first generation of the DC-9 family, entered service in late 1965 and became a commercial success with 976 units built when production ended in 1982. The all-new designed aircraft family includes five members or variants (DC-9-10 / DC-9 Series 10, Series 20, Series 30, Series 40, and Series 50) with ten sub-variants or versions (Series 11, Series 12, Series 14, Series 15, Series 21, Series 31, Series 32, Series 33, Series 34, Series 41, and Series 51) and features two rear fuselage-mounted turbofan engines, a T-tail configuration, a narrow-body fuselage with five-abreast seating for 80 to 135 passengers. The success prompted the manufacturer to further develop the aircraft family with the last member, Series 50, as the reference aircraft.

===Feasibility study===
In the 1970s, McDonnell Douglas began development of the first derivative or second generation of the DC-9 family, a lengthened version of the Series 50, with a higher maximum take-off weight (MTOW), larger wing, new main landing gear, and higher fuel capacity. Availability of newer versions of the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D turbofan engine with higher bypass ratios and thrust ratings drove early studies including designs known as Series 55, Series 50 (refanned Super Stretch), and Series 60. In August 1977, the design effort focused on the Series 55.

===Program launch===
With entry into service projected in 1980, the improved aircraft design was initially designated as the Series 80, which would be the sixth variant of the first generation. In October 1977 Swissair became the launch customer for the Series 80 with an order for 15 plus an option for five. The launch of the next aircraft models followed in October 1977 for the Series 81 (MD-81), on April 16, 1979, for the Series 82 (MD-82), on January 31, 1983, for the Series 83 ( MD-83). January 1985 for Series 87 (MD-87) and January 23, 1986, for Series 88 (MD-88).

===Certification===
====Type designation====
Similar to the first generation of the DC-9 family, the second generation uses second-digit notation, with zero for variant names (Series 80) and non-zero for subvariant or version names (Series 81 through Series 88). Because there was only one variant within the second generation, the Series 80 became the family name and the Series 81 through Series 88 became variant or version names. The first Series 80, DC-9 line number 909, made its first flight on October 18, 1979, as the &quot;Super 80&quot;, which then became the preferred designation for the newly developed aircraft family. Although two aircraft were substantially damaged in accidents, flight testing was completed on August 25, 1980, when the first variant and respectively production model, the JT8D-209-powered Series 81, was certified under an amendment to the FAA type certificate for the DC-9. The flight-testing leading up to certification had involved three aircraft accumulating a total of 1,085 flying hours on 795 flights. After production of the first generation ended in late 1982, a new designation with McDonnell Douglas initials, MD-80, was proposed as the type designation for the second generation and in July 1983, McDonnell Douglas decided that the Super 80 would be officially designated the MD-80. However, the type designation according to the type certificate (TC) is still the original (DC-9 prefix) to save on certification costs, but could also be provided with the new (MD prefix) written in parentheses, e.g. DC-9-81 (MD-81), DC-9-82 (MD-82), DC-9-83 (MD-83) and DC-9-87 (MD-87). Only the last variant, the MD-88, was officially certified under the MD designation.

====Type certification (TC)====

Following the MD-81&#x27;s first flight on October 18, 1979, the MD-82 and MD-83 made their maiden flights on January 8, 1981, and December 17, 1984, respectively. They were then certified by the FAA on August 25, 1980, July 29, 1981, and October 17, 1985, respectively. The first airliner, an MD-81, was delivered to launch operator Swissair on September 13, 1980. Instead of merely using the MD- prefix as a marketing symbol, an application was made to again amend the type certificate to include the MD-81, MD-82, and MD-83. This change was dated March 10, 1986, and the type certificate declared that although the MD designator could be used in parentheses, it must be accompanied by the official designation, for example: DC-9-81 (MD-81). All Long Beach aircraft in the MD-80 series thereafter had MD-81, MD-82, or MD-83 stamped on the aircraft nameplate.

The MD-87 and MD-88 made their first flight on December 4, 1986, and August 15, 1987, respectively. Although not certified until October 21, 1987, McDonnell Douglas had already applied for models DC-9-87 and DC-9-87F on February 14, 1985. The third derivative was similarly officially designated DC-9-87 (MD-87), although no nameplates were stamped DC-9-87. For the MD-88, an application for a type certificate model amendment was made after the earlier changes, so there was not a DC-9-88, which was certified on December 8, 1987. The FAA&#x27;s online aircraft registry database shows the DC-9-88 and DC-9-80 designations in existence but unused.

====Type conversion (STC)====
Type conversions were programs started in 2010 by third parties with support from the TC holder (Boeing, as this was only happening after the merger with McDonnell Douglas in 1997) to convert used MD-80 passenger airliners and provide the required supplemental type certificate (STC) from FAA or EASA.

=====AEI MD-80SF (freighter)=====
The &quot;MD-80SF&quot; was a freighter conversion program for the MD-80 series launched in February 2010, where the suffix SF stands for &quot;special freighter&quot;. The conversion company, the Aeronautical Engineers Inc. (AEI) based in Miami, Florida, had noticed that pre-owned MD-80s could be bought for under $1 million, and at $2.5M for the freighter conversion, an MD-80FS could offer a narrowbody freighter for half the price of a Boeing 737-400SF. The first conversion was undertaken on an ex-American Airlines MD-82 aircraft (FSN 49470 built in 1987), which was used as a test-bed for the supplemental type certificate. The MD-80SF made its inaugural flight on 28 September 2012. AEI was the first and solely firm authorized by Boeing to receive the STC, &quot;ST02434LA&quot;, for the longer variants of the MD-80 series from the FAA in February 2013. The converted freighter with the designation AEI MD-80SF would have a payload of 21.1 tonnes and the ability to take 12 pallets measuring 88 x 108 inches, which would be a good replacement for the Boeing 727 freighter The first converted freighter, an AEI MD-82SF (the prototype), was delivered to the launch customer, Everts Air Cargo, in February 2013.

In 2013, after the first delivery, AEI had orders for 20 MD-80SF freighters, expecting more than 100 conversions over ten years. Despite the initial lively interest, the uptake had been sluggish. AEI had six MD-80s converted by 2015, and three more were on the books for that year. Demand for the MD-80SF was disappointing due to two factors. First, the MD-80&#x27;s cross section does not match the narrowbody freighter types used by the integrators, severely limiting the market for the freighter. Second, the values of the 737-400SF fell faster than expected, closing the gap with the MD-80SF, which burns 12 percent more fuel. In October 2015, the MD-80SF was approved by the EASA with Doc. No. &quot;10055029&quot;. In 2021, after the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for cargo aircraft increased and the initial capital cost of an MD-80SF including conversion, paint and heavy maintenance was less than $5M, (~$ in ) half the cost of a 737-400SF, which made it attractive again. In March, USA Jet Airlines had signed a contract with AEI to convert three MD-88s into freighter, which they purchased from Delta Air Lines, and planned to have seven AEI MD-88SF in its fleet. AEI itself had delivered 21 AEI MD-80SF freighters, two were in progress and six had been ordered.

=====EAT MD-87 (firefighter)=====
The FAA issued the Doc. No. &quot;STC ST02507LA&quot;, for Erickson Aero Tanker, LLC, located in Hillsboro, Oregon (referred to as &quot;EAT&quot;) in 2014 to certify their EAT MD-87 firefighters. In the said STC, EAT MD-87 air tankers are required to drop retardant with landing gear down to prevent stalling. The dedicated test pilot said that during a test with the external tank, the FAA representative was not satisfied with the aircraft&#x27;s response after being placed deep in the stall (beyond the stall warnings, stick shaker, and stick pusher). In early 2017, EAT petitioned the FAA for an exemption from this requirement, 14 CFR 25.201(b)(1), and requested a &quot;Flaps 40/Landing Gear Up&quot; configuration while dropping, but on June 28, 2017, that exemption was denied with the reason given by the FAA that it would have allowed aerial firefighting retardant drops in a configuration that does not fully meet the stall characteristics requirements on the modified DC-9-87 (MD-87) aircraft. EAT was then working on an additional layer of status display to complement the existing system.

===Entry into service===
The launch operator Swissair put the MD-81 into service on October 10, 1980, with a flight from Zurich to London Heathrow. The MD-82, MD-83, MD-87, and MD-88 entered service later with Republic Airlines in August 1981, Alaska Airlines in February 1985, Austrian Airlines in November 1987, and Delta Air Lines in January 1988, respectively.

===Production===
The second generation (later named MD-80s) was produced on a common line with the first generation DC-9s, with which it shares its line number sequence. After the delivery of 976 DC-9s and 108 MD-80s, McDonnell Douglas stopped DC-9 production. Hence, commencing with the 1,085th DC-9/MD-80 delivery, an MD-82 for VIASA in December 1982, only second generation or MD-80s were produced.

In 1985, McDonnell Douglas, after years of negotiating attributed to Gareth C.C. Chang, president of a McDonnell Douglas subsidiary, signed an agreement for joint production of MD-80s and MD-90s in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The agreement was for 26 aircraft, of which 20 were eventually produced along with two MD-90 aircraft. Upon cancellation of the co-production program, China refused to return the tooling used to McDonnell Douglas, and subsequently used it and the fuselage cross-section design in what became the Comac ARJ21 regional jet.

During 1991, MD-80 production had reached a peak of 12 per month, having been running at approximately 10 per month since 1987 and was expected to continue at this rate in the near term (140 MD-80s were delivered in 1991). As a result of the decline in the air traffic and a slow market response to the MD-90, MD-80 production was reduced, and 84 aircraft were handed over in 1992. A further production rate cut resulted in 42 MD-80s delivered during 1993 (3.5 per month) and 22 aircraft were handed over. MD-80 production ended in 1999, with the final MD-80, an MD-83 registered as N984TW, being delivered to TWA.

===Other proposals===
====MD-89====
In 1984–1985, McDonnell Douglas proposed a 173-passenger, stretch of the MD-80 called the MD-89, which would use the International Aero Engines V2500 engine instead of the regular JT8D-200 series engines. The MD-89 was intended to have two fuselage plugs forward of the wing and one fuselage plug aft of the wing. IAE and McDonnell Douglas announced an agreement to jointly market this derivative on February 1, 1985, but the concept was subsequently deprioritized in favor of the proposed MD-91 and MD-92 derivatives using ultra-high bypass (UHB) propfan engines. By 1989, however, lack of airline orders for the UHB derivatives caused McDonnell Douglas to return to the IAE V2500 engines to launch its MD-90 series aircraft.

====MD-80 Advanced====
In order to better manage the transition from the second generation, MD-80, to the third generation, MD-90, McDonnell Douglas revealed at the end of 1990 that it would be developing an MD-80 &quot;improvement package&quot; with the intent to offer beginning in early 1991 for delivery from mid-1993. The aircraft concept became known as the &quot;MD-80 Advanced&quot;. The &quot;main improvement&quot; was the installation of Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-290 engines (never built) with a 1.5 in larger diameter fan that would allow for a 6 dB reduction in exterior noise. The MD-80 Advanced was to incorporate the advanced flight deck of the MD-88, including a choice of reference systems, with an inertial reference system as standard fitting and optional attitude-heading equipment. It was to be equipped with an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), an optional second flight management system (FMS), and light-emitting diode (LED) dot-matrix electronic engine and system displays. A Honeywell wind-shear computer and provision for an optional traffic-alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) were also to be included. A completely new passenger compartment design would have a 12% increase in overhead baggage space and stowage compartment lights that come on when the doors open, as well as new video system featuring drop-down LCD monitors above. These changes would be also available by retrofit to existing MD-80s. Due to lack of market interest, McDonnell Douglas dropped its plans to offer the MD-80 Advanced during 1991.

In the course of 1993, a &quot;mark 2&quot; MD-80 Advanced version reappeared with the modified JT8D-290 engines as previously proposed. In late 1993, Pratt &amp; Whitney launched a modified version of the JT8D-200 series, the -218B, which was being offered for the DC-9X re-engining program, and was also evaluating the possibility of developing a new JT8D for possible retrofit on the MD-80. The to thrust -218B engine version shares a 98% commonality with the existing engine, with changes designed to reduce NOx, improve durability, and reduce noise levels by 3 dB. The 218B could be certified in early to mid-1996. The new engine, dubbed the &quot;8000&quot;, was to feature a new fan of increased diameter (by 1.7 in), extended exhaust cone, a larger LP compressor, a new annular burner, and a new LP turbine and mixer. The initial thrust rating would be around . A launch decision on the new engine was expected by mid-1994, but never occurred. The engine would also be available on new build MD-80s. McDonnell Douglas also evaluated the addition of winglets on the MD-80.

===Further developments===
====MD-90====
The MD-90 was developed from the MD-80 series and is a , updated version of the MD-88 with a similar electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) (glass cockpit), and improved, and quieter IAE V2500 high-bypass turbofan engines. The MD-90 program began in 1989, first flew in 1993, and entered commercial service in 1995. The MD-90ER extended range version was also offered. Delta Air Lines flew the final MD-90 passenger flight on June 2, 2020, marking the retirement of the type.

====MD-95====
The MD-95 was developed to replace early DC-9 models, which were approaching 30 years of age. The project completely overhauled the original DC-9 into a modern airliner. It is slightly longer than the DC-9-30 and is powered by new Rolls-Royce BR715 engines. The MD-95 was renamed &quot;Boeing 717&quot; after the McDonnell Douglas-Boeing merger in 1997.

==Design==
The MD-80 series is a mid-size, medium-range airliner, featuring a fuselage longer than the DC-9-50. The small, highly efficient wing design of the baseline aircraft was enlarged by adding sections at the wing root and tip for a 28% larger wing. The aircraft derivative retains the configuration of two rear fuselage-mounted turbofan engines, a T-tail, and has cockpit, avionics and aerodynamic upgrades. The airliner is designed for frequent, short-haul flights for up to 172 passengers depending on airplane version and seating arrangement.

===Flight deck===

The flight deck of the MD-80 aircraft featured advancements from the previous DC-9 series aircraft. Electro-mechanical instrumentation with an attitude-heading reference system was standard, with a multi-panel electronic flight instrument system standard on later build aircraft. Earlier aircraft were upgradeable to EFIS instrumentation. A full flight management system or Performance Management Computer was offered. A traffic alert and collision avoidance system, a state-of-the-art inertial reference system, and LED dot-matrix displays for engine and system monitoring were all available on later build aircraft as standard.

===Avionics===
The MD-80 features an advanced avionics suite which includes two autonomous digital flight guidance computers. It is also equipped with a glareshield-mounted flight guidance control panel, flight director, autothrottle, thrust mode selection system, and an autoland system.

===Cabin===

The left side of the main cabin features aisle seats. It comprises three to six rows in the first class section, seven to 32 in the main cabin and around 21 in the exit row. It features five-abreast seating in the coach class.

===Engines===
The MD-80 is powered by two more powerful, more efficient and quieter Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-209 turbofan engines, which are a significant upgrade over the smaller JT8D-15, -17, -11, and -9 series. Each engine can produce 82–93 kN of thrust. The JT8D-209 is an advanced engine operated by 350 operators to power around 4,500 aircraft. The engine provides high reliability and low maintenance costs. The engine operates at flat–rated temperature.

===Performance===
The maximum and cruise speed of the aircraft are 925 km/h and 811 km/h, respectively. It has a maximum range of 2,897 km and a fuel capacity of 22,106 l. The aircraft weights around 35,300 kg. The maximum take-off weight is 63,500 kg.

==Operational history==

===Passenger===
The second-generation, MD-80 series, passenger airliners have longer fuselages as well as longer range than their earlier counterparts, the first-generation of the DC-9 family. Some customers, such as American Airlines, still refer to the airplanes in fleet documentation as the &quot;Super 80&quot;, their former designation. Comparable airliners to the MD-80 series include the Boeing 737-400 and Airbus A319. It was the most delivered MD- series and often nicknamed as the &quot;Mad Dog&quot; by the operators, has been used by airlines around the world. Major customers have included Aerolíneas Argentinas, Aeroméxico, Aeropostal Aerorepublica, Alaska Airlines, Alitalia, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Aserca, Austral Líneas Aéreas, Austrian Airlines, Avianca, China Eastern Airlines, China Northern Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Finnair, Iberia, Insel Air, Japan Air System (JAS), Korean Air, Lion Air, Martinair Holland, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), Reno Air, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), Spanair, Spirit Airlines, Swissair, Trans World Airlines and Meridiana.

American Airlines was the first US major carrier to order the MD-80 when it leased twenty 142-seat aircraft from McDonnell Douglas in October 1982 to replace its Boeing 727-100s. It committed to 67 firm orders plus 100 options in March 1984, and in 2002 its fleet peaked at more than 360 aircraft, % of the 1,191 produced. The MD-80 was the workhorse of the airline&#x27;s fleet throughout the 1980s and beyond.

Due to the use of the aging JT8D engines, the MD-80 is not fuel efficient compared to the A320 or newer 737 models; it burns of jet fuel per hour on a typical flight, while the larger Boeing 737-800 burns per hour (19% reduction). In the 2000s many airlines began to retire the type. Alaska Airlines&#x27; tipping point in using the 737-800 was the $4 per gallon price of jet fuel the airline was paying by the summer of 2008; the airline stated that a typical Los Angeles-Seattle flight would cost $2,000 less, using a Boeing 737-800, than the same flight using an MD-80.

In late March 2008 and again in early April 2008, an FAA safety audit of American Airlines forced the airline to ground all its MD-80 series aircraft (approximately 300) to inspect the wiring for one of the aircraft&#x27;s hydraulic systems. This led to American canceling nearly 2,500 flights in March and over 3,200 in April. In addition, Delta Air Lines voluntarily inspected its own MD-80 fleet to ensure its 117 MD-80s were also operating within regulation. This resulted in Delta canceling 275 flights.

Midwest Airlines announced on July 14, 2008, that it would retire all 12 of its MD-80s (used primarily on routes to the West Coast) by the fall. The JT8D&#x27;s comparatively lower maintenance costs due to simpler design help narrow the fuel cost gap.

American Airlines announced that it would remove all of its MD-80s by 2019, replacing them with 737-800s. The airline flew its final MD-80 revenue flights on September 3 and 4, 2019 before retiring its 26 remaining aircraft. The final MD-80 flight on September 4, 2019, Flight 80, flew from Dallas/Fort Worth to Chicago–O&#x27;Hare. The retired planes were flown later to the New Mexico desert to be mothballed. A former American Airlines MD-83 is being readied for use as of January 2025.

Delta Air Lines was expected to retire its MD-80 series jetliners at the end of 2020, but instead the airline began accelerating the fleet retirement in March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic saw passenger levels drop critically low for airlines. On June 2, 2020, the final flights arrived at Delta&#x27;s home base and hub Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International in Atlanta from Dulles International Airport in Virginia, outside of Washington, D.C., and George Bush International Airport in Houston. This was the last scheduled passenger service in the US of any McDonnell Douglas airliner. Delta&#x27;s MD-80 fleet was put into storage.

===Freighter===
In February 2013, Commercial Jet Inc. (CJI) delivered the first AEI MD-80SF, an MD-82SF (the prototype), to Everts Air Cargo, the launch customer of the MD-80SF passenger-to-freighter conversion program by the Aeronautical Engineers Inc. (AEI). In August 2013, USA Jet Airlines became the launch operator of the MD-80SF freighter conversion program with an MD-88SF. The cargo airline purchased 15 MD-88 aircraft from Delta, six of which would be converted and the other nine used as spares. USA Jet Airlines specialized in &quot;on demand cargo transport&quot; within North America.

In 2021, most operators used the AEI MD-80SF freighter to carry Ford Motor Co. and General Motors automotive parts from Mexico to the U.S., but it was also used in Alaska for general freight and fish. The MD-80SF has a low deck height that allows it to load cargo from a pickup truck when needed, which is not possible on a Boeing 757 freighter. However, its cross section is too narrow to transport standard &quot;A&quot; type containers and instead a dozen non-standard 88 x 108 inch containers or pallets, which is the main disadvantage in cargo operations.

In late July 2022, Everts Air Cargo (EAC) selected Universal Avionics, an Elbit Systems company, to deliver cockpit upgrades (avionics, FMS with LPV capability, and integrated GPS) for its MD-80SF aircraft to improve safety and operational efficiency. EAC specializes in transporting freight and mail in Alaska and uses its MD-80SF fleet to supply &quot;on demand charter service&quot; operations throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Caribbean Islands.

===Firefighter===
As of July 2022, Erickson Aero Tanker operates six MD-87 aircraft converted for use as aerial firefighting air tankers for the U.S. Forest Service, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and other government agencies. The MD-87 air tanker&#x27;s capacity is 4,000 gallons or 1,920 gallons more than the capacity of the Lockheed P-2 Neptune tankers and 1,000 gallons more than Bae-146 tankers. That is well short of the 19,000+ gallon capacity of the 747 Global Super Tanker, but the MD-87 is much more cost-effective to operate and can utilize more austere fields with shorter runways. The MD-87 firefighter is loaded using one or two (individual or simultaneously) 3-inch coupled loading ports on each side of the fuselage. These ports can sustain up to 600 gallons per minute flow maximum. Few, if any tanker bases utilize both ports, loading using a single port at an average flow rate of 450 gallons per minute, giving the load time of under seven minutes.

Another interesting feature of the MD-87 tanker, as well as Douglas DC-7s and some other large tanker-modified aircraft, is that the plane can be flown with the landing gear down during the retardant drop, which reduces airspeed while allowing higher engine RPMs, reducing lag on post-drop climb out- similar to a speed brake. Occasionally only the main gear are extended with nose gear stowed. When pulling off or up after a retardant drop the pilots simply want as much aircraft performance available as possible.

;Dimensions: The basic &quot;long-body&quot; MD-80 versions (MD-81, MD-82, MD-83, and MD-88) have an overall length of , and a fuselage length of that is 4.62 m longer than the DC-9-50 and 13.5 m longer than the initial DC-9, the Series 10. Wingspan was also increased by 4.4 m in comparison with earlier DC-9s at . The aircraft&#x27;s passenger cabin, from cockpit door to aft bulkhead, is long and, as with all versions of the DC-9, has a maximum cabin width (trim-to-trim) of .

;Powerplant: The initial production version of the MD-80 was the Pratt and Whitney JT8D-209 thrust-powered MD-81. Later build MD-81s have been delivered with more powerful JT8D-217 and -219 engines.

;APU: All versions of the MD-80 are equipped with an AlliedSignal (Garrett) GTCP85-98D APU as standard, which is located in the aft fuselage.

;Flight deck: The MD-80 is equipped with a two crew flightdeck similar to that on the DC-9 from which it evolved. Later models could be equipped to a higher specification with EFIS displays in place of the traditional analogue instruments, TCAS, windshear detection, etc. An EFIS retrofit to non-EFIS-equipped aircraft is possible.

;Cabin: Typical passenger-cabin seating arrangements include:
: A mixed-class, with aft full-service galley, configuration for a total of 135 passengers with 12 first class, four-abreast 36-inch seat pitch.
: 123 economy-class passengers, five-abreast, 32-inch pitch.
: All-economy layout for 155 passengers, five-abreast, 32- and 33-inch pitch.
: A typical high-density layout is for 167 in one class (i.e., Airtours).

;Undercarriage: All versions of the MD-80 are equipped with a tricycle undercarriage, featuring a twin nose unit with spray deflector and twin main units with rock deflectors. The MD-80T, developed for the Chinese, differs in that the main units are each fitted with a four-wheel double-main-bogey undercarriage to reduce pavement loading.

;Aerodynamic improvements: From mid-1987, new MD-87-style low-drag &quot;beaver&quot; tail cones were introduced on all series of MD-80s, reducing drag and improving fuel burn. Some operators have been modifying the old DC-9-style cones on earlier-build MD-80s to the new low-drag style. Scandinavian Airlines System has done this, citing the improved economics and cosmetics from the modification.

===MD-81===
The MD-81 (originally known as the DC-9 Super 81 or DC-9-81) was the first production model of the MD-80, and apart from the MD-87, the differences between the various long-body MD-80 variants are relatively minor. The four long-body models (MD-81, MD-82, MD-83, and MD-88) only differ from each other in having different engine variants, fuel capacities, and weights. The MD-88 and later-build versions of the other models have more up-to-date flight decks featuring for example EFIS.

===MD-82===
Announced on April 16, 1979, the MD-82 (DC-9-82) was a new MD-80 variant with similar dimensions to those of the MD-81 but equipped with more powerful engines. The MD-82 was intended for operation from &#x27;hot and high&#x27; airports but also offered greater payload/range when in use at &#x27;standard&#x27; airfields. American Airlines was the world&#x27;s largest operator of the MD-82, with at one point over 300 MD-82s in the fleet.

Originally certified with thrust JT8D-217s, a -217A-powered MD-82 was certified in mid-1982 and became available that year. The new version featured a higher MTOW (), while the JT8D-217As had a guaranteed take-off thrust at temperatures up to or altitude. The JT8D-217C engines were also offered on the MD-82, giving improved Thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC). Several operators took delivery of the -219-powered MD-82s, while Balair ordered its MD-82s powered by the lower-thrust -209 engine.

The MD-82 features an increased standard MTOW initially to , and this was later increased to . Standard fuel capacity is the same as that of the MD-81, , and typical range with 155 passengers is .

* First delivery: August 5, 1981, to Republic Airlines
* Entry into service: August, 1981 with Republic Airlines
* Last delivery: November 17, 1997, to U-Land Airlines of Taiwan

The MD-82 was assembled under license in Shanghai by the Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corporation (SAIC, today&#x27;s COMAC) beginning in November 1986; the sub-assemblies were delivered by McDonnell Douglas in kit form. China had begun design on a cargo version, designated Y-13, but the project was subsequently canceled with the conclusion of the licensed assembly of the MD-82 and MD-90 in China. In 2012, Aeronautical Engineers Inc. performed the first commercial-freighter conversion of an MD-82.

===MD-83===
The MD-83 (DC-9-83) is a longer-range version of the basic MD-81/82 with higher weights, more powerful engines, and increased fuel capacity.

;Powerplant: Compared to earlier models, the MD-83 is equipped with slightly more powerful -thrust Pratt and Whitney JT8D-219s as standard.

;Performance: The MD-83 features increased fuel capacity as standard (to ), which is carried in two auxiliary tanks located fore and aft of the center section. The aircraft also has higher operating weights, with MTOW increased to and MLW to . Typical range for the MD-83 with 155 passengers is around . To cope with the higher operating weights, the MD-83 incorporates strengthened landing gear including new wheels, tires, and brakes, changes to the wing skins, front spar web and elevator spar cap, and strengthened floor beams and panels to carry the auxiliary fuel tanks. From MD-80 line number 1194, an MD-81 delivered in September 1985, it is understood that all MD-80s have the same basic wing structure and in theory could be converted to MD-83 standard.

===MD-87===
In January 1985, McDonnell Douglas announced it would produce a shorter-fuselage MD-80 variant, designated MD-87 (DC-9-87), which would seat between 109 and 130 passengers depending upon configuration. The designation was intended to indicate its planned date of entry into service, 1987.

;Dimensions: With an overall length of , the MD-87 is shorter than the other MD-80s but is otherwise generally similar to them, employing the same engines, systems and flight deck. The MD-87 features modifications to its tail, with a fin extension above the tailplane. It also introduced a new low-drag &quot;beaver&quot; tail cone, which became standard on all MD-80s.

;Powerplant: The MD-87 was offered with either the thrust JT8D-217C or the thrust -219.

;Performance: Two basic versions of the MD-87 were made available with either an MTOW of and MLW of or an MTOW of and an MLW of . Fuel capacity is , increasing to with the incorporation of two auxiliary fuel tanks. Typical range with 130 passengers, is increasing to with two auxiliary fuel tanks.

;Cabin: The MD-87 provides typical mixed-class seating for 114 passengers or 130 in an all-economy layout (five-abreast 31 in and 32 in seat pitch). The maximum seating, exit-limited, is for 139 passengers.

* First delivery: November 27, 1987, to Austrian Airlines
* Last delivery: March 27, 1992, to Scandinavian Airlines (SAS)

===MD-88===
The MD-88 was the last variant of the MD-80, which was launched on January 23, 1986, on the back of orders and options from Delta Air Lines for a total of 80 aircraft.

The MD-88 is, depending on specification, basically similar to the MD-82 or MD-83 except it incorporates an EFIS cockpit instead of the more traditional analog flight deck of the other MD-80s. Other changes incorporated into the MD-88 include a wind-shear warning system and general updating of the cabin interior/trim. These detail changes are relatively minor and were written back as standard on the MD-82/83. The wind-shear warning system was offered as a standard option on all other MD-80s and has been made available for retrofitting on earlier aircraft including the DC-9.

Delta&#x27;s initial eight aircraft were manufactured as MD-82s and upgraded to MD-88 specifications. MD-88 deliveries began in December 1987, and it entered service with Delta in January 1988. The final commercial passenger flight of an MD-88 within the United States took place on June 2, 2020, by a Delta flight from Washington Dulles to Atlanta. In 2021, Michigan&#x27;s USA Jet Airlines added MD-88s to their ad-hoc operations&#x27; freighter fleet.

;Performance: The MD-88 has the same weight, range, and airfield performance as the other long-body aircraft (MD-82 and MD-83) and is powered by the same engines. MDC quotes a typical range for the MD-88 as with 155 passengers. Adding two additional auxiliary fuel tanks increases its 155-passenger range to (similar to the MD-83). A &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article about the crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 1086 at New York City&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport in March 2015 stated that &quot;pilots and other safety experts have long known that when the MD-88&#x27;s reversers are deployed, its rudder... sometimes may not be powerful enough to control deviations to the left or right from the center of a runway...safety board investigators, among other things, are looking to see if this tendency played any role in the crash..&quot;.

===Conversions===
The freighter conversion is available for the longer variants of MD-80 series (the MD-81, MD-82, MD-83 and MD-88), while the firefighter conversion is for the shortest variant, the MD-87.

====AEI MD-80SF (freighter)====
In February 2010, the Aeronautical Engineers Inc. (AEI) announced it was beginning a freighter conversion program for the MD-80 series. The converted aircraft use the &quot;MD-80SF&quot; (MD-80 special freghter) designation. AEI is solely certified by FAA and EASA to perform conversions on the longer variants of MD-80 series (the MD-81, MD-82, MD-83 and MD-88). The AEI MD-80SF freighter conversion consists of the installation of a 85&quot;×136&quot; large cargo door on the left side of the fuselage and modification of main deck to a &quot;Class E&quot; cargo compartment, with independent smoke detection system. Cabin windows replaced with lightweight aluminum window plugs. After conversion the freighter can carry twelve 88&quot;×108&quot; or eight 125&quot;×88&quot; ULDs or eight 125&quot;×96&quot; ULDs. The cargo door is hydraulically operated and actuated from the inside of the aircraft by an independent system. Hydraulic pressure is available from two sources; an electrically operated hydraulic pump or a manual hand pump. The door control and manual pump are located on the 9 g barrier, allowing a single person to operate the door manually. The installation of cargo doors and other structural changes are performed by Commercial Jet Inc. (CJI), which is licensed to install the AEI-designed conversion kit at its Dothan, Alabama facility.

====EAT MD-87 (firefighter)====
In 2013, five MD-87 aircraft formerly operated by Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) were converted for aerial firefighting use by Aero Air/Erickson Aero Tanker (EAT). The external tank (pod) is installed below the retardant tank doors, lowering the release point by 46 inches and thus reducing the possibility of retardant spreading over the wing that could be further ingested into the engines. On May 30, 2019, AerSale, a global supplier of mid-life aircraft, engines, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services, announced that it had signed a contract with Aero Air/ Erickson Aero Tanker to build the sixth MD-87 firefighting air tanker, beginning conversion on April 1, 2019, at AerSale&#x27;s MRO facility in Goodyear, Arizona. The new air tanker will cruise at 450 knots, carry 3,000 gallons of fire retardant in all environments up to 40 degrees Celsius, boast a 900-mile loaded strike range, require only a 5,200-foot runway loaded, and both take off and land fully loaded.

===Deliveries===
==Accidents and incidents==
, the MD-80 series has been involved in 90 major aviation accidents and incidents, including 47 hull-losses, with 1,446 fatalities of occupants.

===Accidents with fatalities===
* On December 1, 1981, Inex-Adria Aviopromet Flight 1308, MD-81 (YU-ANA), crashed into Corsica&#x27;s Mt. San Pietro during a holding pattern for landing at Campo dell&#x27;Oro Airport, Ajaccio, France. All 180 passengers and crew were killed. This was the first-ever fatal incident involving the MD-80 series and also the deadliest.
* On August 16, 1987, Northwest Airlines Flight 255, an MD-82, crashed shortly after takeoff from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport because the flight crew failed to use the taxi checklist to ensure that flaps and slats were extended for takeoff, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). All crew and 154 passengers were killed, with the exception of a four-year-old girl, Cecelia Cichan. Two people on the ground were also killed.
*On June 12, 1988, Austral Líneas Aéreas Flight 46, MD-81 (N1003G), crashed short of the runway at Libertador General José de San Martín Airport, in Posadas, Misiones. All 61 passengers and crew were killed.
* On October 26, 1993, China Eastern Airlines Flight 5398, MD-82 (B-2103), overran the runway on landing at Fuzhou Yixu Airport in poor visibility due to pilot error, killing two of 80 on board.
* On November 13, 1993, China Northern Airlines Flight 6901, MD-82 (B-2141) crashed before landing at Ürümqi Diwopu International Airport in Xinjiang, China, killing twelve of the 102 passengers and crew on board.
* On July 6, 1996, Delta Air Lines Flight 1288, an MD-88, attempting to take off from Pensacola Regional Airport experienced an uncontained, catastrophic turbine engine failure that caused debris from the front compressor hub of the number one left engine to penetrate the left aft fuselage. The penetrating debris left two passengers dead and two severely injured; all were from the same family. The pilot aborted takeoff, and the airplane stopped on the runway.
* On June 1, 1999, American Airlines Flight 1420, an MD-82, attempting to land in severe weather conditions at Little Rock Airport, overshot the runway and crashed into the banks of the Arkansas River. Eleven people, including the captain, died.
* On January 31, 2000, Alaska Airlines Flight 261, an MD-83, crashed in the Pacific Ocean because it lost horizontal stabilizer control. All 88 passengers and crew on board were killed. Following the crash, an improperly maintained Acme nut and jackscrew recovered from the aircraft were found to be excessively worn. An airworthiness directive (AD) was issued by the FAA requiring more frequent inspections and lubrication of the jackscrew assembly.
* On October 8, 2001, Scandinavian Airlines Flight 686, MD-87 (SE-DMA) collided with a Cessna Citation CJ2 jet (D-IEVX) during takeoff at Linate Airport, Milan, Italy. The runway collision left 118 people dead and remains the deadliest air disaster in Italy. The cause of the accident was a misunderstanding between air traffic controllers and the Cessna jet, complicated by inoperative ground movement radar at the time of the accident. The SAS crew had no role in causing the accident.
* On May 7, 2002, China Northern Airlines Flight 6136, MD-82 (B-2138), from Beijing to Dalian, crashed into Dalian Bay near Dalian after the pilot reported &quot;fire on board&quot;. All 112 people on board were killed. Investigators determined that the fire had been set by a suicidal passenger.
* On November 30, 2004, Lion Air Flight 583, an MD-82, crashed on landing at Adi Sumarmo Airport in Surakarta, Indonesia and overran the end of the runway, killing 25 of 163 on board.
* On August 16, 2005, West Caribbean Airways Flight 708, an MD-82, crashed in a mountainous region in northwest Venezuela killing all 152 passengers and eight crew.
* On September 16, 2007, One-Two-GO Airlines Flight 269, an MD-82, crashed at the side of the runway and exploded after an apparent attempt to execute a go-around in bad weather at Phuket International Airport in Phuket, Thailand. Of the 130 passengers and crew on board, 90 were killed.
* On November 30, 2007, Atlasjet Flight 4203, an MD-83, crashed in the southwestern province of Isparta, Turkey, killing all 49 passengers and 7 crew. The cause of the crash was attributed to pilot spatial disorientation.
* On August 20, 2008, Spanair Flight 5022, MD-82 (EC-HFP), from Madrid&#x27;s Barajas Airport crashed shortly after takeoff on a flight to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. The MD-82 had 162 passengers and ten crew on board, of whom 18 survived. The crash was caused by attempting to take off with the flaps and slats retracted. The flight crew omitted the &quot;set flaps and slats&quot; item in both the After Start checklist and the Takeoff Imminent checklist. The takeoff warning system (TOWS), which should have emitted an audio warning on the runway when the throttles were advanced for takeoff with the airplane wrongly configured for takeoff, did not sound.
* On June 3, 2012, Dana Air Flight 992, MD-83 (5N-RAM), crashed into a two-story building in Lagos, Nigeria, caused by engine failure. All 153 passengers and crew on board were killed, as well as 6 on the ground.
* On July 24, 2014, Air Algérie Flight 5017, MD-83, registration EC-LTV, a scheduled flight from Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, to Algiers, Algeria, operated with an MD-83 leased from Swiftair. The aircraft crashed southeast of Gossi, Mali, about 50 minutes after takeoff. All 110 passengers and six crew were killed.

===Hull losses===
* On December 27, 1991, SAS Flight 751, an MD-81 (OY-KHO, &quot;Dana Viking&quot;), crash-landed at Gottröra, Sweden. In the initial climb, both engines ingested ice broken loose from the wings (although they had been properly deiced before departure). The ice damaged the compressor blades causing compressor stall. The stall further caused repeated engine surges that finally destroyed both engines, leaving the aircraft with no thrust. The aircraft landed in a snowy field and broke into three parts. No fire occurred, and all aboard survived.
* On March 16, 2007, Kish Air MD-82 (LZ-LDD) leased from Bulgarian Air Charter was damaged beyond repair in a hard landing accident at Kish Island Airport. There were no fatalities.
* On January 24, 2012, Swiftair Flight 94, an MD-83 (EC-JJS), suffered a wingtip strike while landing at Kandahar Airport, Afghanistan. Although there were no injuries to the 92 passengers and crew on board, the starboard wing sustained a broken main spar, and the aircraft was damaged beyond economic repair. It was consequently scrapped at Kandahar.
* On March 5, 2015, Delta Air Lines Flight 1086, an MD-88 (N909DL), skidded off the runway on landing at LaGuardia Airport, New York in snowy weather, suffering severe damage. A few minor injuries occurred during evacuation via the emergency chutes. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were reportedly focusing on the aircraft&#x27;s braking system and rudder.
* On March 8, 2017, Ameristar Charters Flight 9363, MD-83 (N786TW), overran the end of runway 23L at Willow Run Airport in Ypsilanti, Michigan, after rejecting a takeoff at very high speed due to a jammed elevator which could not be detected prior to the attempted takeoff. Only one injury occurred among the 116 on board, but the aircraft&#x27;s belly and wings were substantially damaged after its landing gear collapsed during the overrun, and it was eventually written off.
* On June 14, 2018, Bravo Airways Flight 4406, an MD-83 (UR-CPR), slid off the runway on landing at Igor Sikorsky International Airport following an unstable approach; all 176 on board survived.
* On January 27, 2020, Caspian Airlines Flight 6936, an MD-83, overran the end of the Mahshahr Airport&#x27;s runway 13 with 144 people on board. There were two injuries; the aircraft received substantial damage.
* On October 19, 2021, an MD-87, registration N987AK, crashed on take-off from Houston Executive Airport. All 21 people on board survived but the aircraft was destroyed by a post-crash fire. During examination of the intact tail section, it was found that both left and right elevators were jammed in a trailing edge down position. The aircraft was chartered to fly the passengers to Boston for a Red Sox baseball game.
* On June 21, 2022, RED Air Flight 203, an MD-82 (reg. HI1064), suffered a landing gear collapse and runway excursion upon landing at Miami International Airport, causing the right wing to catch fire. There were three minor injuries among the 140 passengers and crew, but the aircraft was written off.
* On February 9, 2024, an MD-82, registration 5Y-AXL and owned by African Express Airways, sustained substantial damage when it was involved in an accident at Malakal Airport, South Sudan. There were no injuries but the aircraft was written off. It received further damage on March 31, 2024 when it collided with Safe Air&#x27;s Boeing 727-2Q9F, which overran the runway during an emergency landing.

<text>The Airbus A318 is the smallest and least numerous variant airliner of the Airbus A320 family. The A318 carries 107 to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of . Final assembly of the aircraft took place in Hamburg, Germany. It is intended primarily for short-range service.

The aircraft shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing pilots to fly all versions of the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the second largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, behind the Airbus A220, allowing flights at airports such as London City.

The A318 entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, it sold only small numbers with total orders for 80 aircraft placed. The type is no longer listed for sale, having been supplanted by the A220 narrowbody. Air France was the largest operator of the Airbus A318. There have been no reports of accidents involving the type.

== Development ==

=== Background ===
The first member of the A320 aircraft family was the A320, which first flew on 22 February 1987 after the program was launched in March 1984. The family was soon extended to include the stretched A321 (first delivery 1994), the shortened A319 (first delivery 1996), and the further shortened A318 (first delivery 2003). The A320 family pioneered the use in commercial aircraft of digital fly-by-wire flight control systems, as well as side stick controls.

The Airbus A318 project had its origins in the collaboration among Chinese, Singaporean and European manufacturers. In May 1997, during the visit of French President Jacques Chirac to China, Aviation Industries of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace (STAe), Airbus and Alenia signed a framework agreement that outlined the development of aircraft in the 100-seat range. The AE31X, as it was tentatively dubbed, besides being a global industrial programme would have significantly deepened Sino-European commercial ties. With development costs estimated to be upwards of $2 billion, AVIC would have a 46 percent stake in the project, STAe 15 percent, and Airbus Industrie Asia 39 percent, the latter of which comprised Airbus and Alenia. Final assembly would have taken place in China.

The project never went past the exploratory phase. It comprised two clean-sheet designs – the AE316 and the AE317. The AE316 would have had a length of , and the AE317, . The standard versions of both variants had a maximum take-off weight of for the smaller version and for the AE317, and would have been powered by either BMW Rolls-Royce, CFM International, or Pratt &amp; Whitney turbofan engines. Range was settled at for both standard variants, although there was a higher-gross weight version which had greater range and engine power. The AE316 and AE317 would have seated a maximum of 105 and 125 passengers in five-abreast seating, respectively. Both would share a flight deck and fly-by-wire flight control system similar to that of the A320 family.

Market research conducted during 1997 revealed that airlines wanted a smaller aircraft in the 70–80-seat range. As the project proceeded, there were increasing disagreements between the Chinese side and Airbus. China wanted a larger aircraft than originally envisioned. In addition, there were difficulties arising out of negotiations about technology transfer and production workshare, and a weak business case. STAe, having previously expressed doubts about returns on the project, in 1998 withdrew from the project out of the failure between AIA and AVIC to reach an agreement; Airbus and AVIC would cancel the project in July that year. The A318 is believed to have emerged from the AE31X project though an Airbus-only project, named the A319M5 in March 1998, began before the AE31X cancellation.

=== Design phase ===
The internal corporate designation, &quot;A319M5&quot;, was used as early as March 1998, as an A319 derivative with fuselage shortening of ahead of the wing and behind. The final proposal was for an aircraft seating 107 passengers in a two-class layout with a range of . The aircraft&#x27;s production took advantage of laser welding, eliminating the necessity for heavy rivets and bolts.

During the design process, the A318 encountered several problems. The first one was the decline in demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks. Another was the new Pratt &amp; Whitney turbofan engines, which burned more fuel than expected. By the time CFM International (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including Air China and British Airways. America West Airlines, which had selected the Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by American Airlines, which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a regional jet alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept it in the same class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type&#x27;s market potential.

The aircraft is powered by two CFM56-5 or Pratt &amp; Whitney PW6000 engines with maximum thrust ratings of between . Launch customers Frontier Airlines and Air France took deliveries in 2003, with Frontier receiving its aircraft in July of that year. The list price of an A318 ranges from $56 to $62 million, and operating costs are between $2,500 and $3,000 for each flight hour.

Orders for the A318 have been relatively slow, but slightly better than for its direct competitor the Boeing 737-600. By 30 September 2017, Airbus had received 80 orders for this model compared to 69 for the 737-600. The sales pace has been influenced by the strong sales of the Bombardier CRJ900 and Embraer E-Jet family. The biggest A318 customers were governments, executive and private jets (20), Air France (18), Avianca Holdings (15), lessor GE Capital Aviation Services (12) and Frontier Airlines (9).

=== Further developments ===
On 10 November 2005 Airbus announced the A318 Elite. The Airbus A318 Elite is aimed at the medium-range market for flights of up to range, with a choice of two cabin layouts seating up to 18 passengers, and powered by CFM engines. Comlux Aviation became the launch customer by ordering three A318 Elite aircraft.

In September 2010, Airbus confirmed that from 2013 the Airbus A318 would become available with &quot;Sharklets&quot;, wingtip devices which reduce lift-induced drag and improve efficiency through reduced fuel consumption. The optional devices, which will also be available on other Airbus A320 family models and are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division, will increase the range of the aircraft to – an increase of over a standard A318 with 107 seats in a two-class configuration.

When Airbus announced its re-engined A320neo family, the A318 was the only variant that did not have a new engine option. However, Airbus said that an A318neo could be developed in the future should demand arise.

== Design ==
The Airbus A318 is a small commercial, narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and is powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A318, CFM International with the CFM56-5B engine and Pratt &amp; Whitney with the PW6000 engine. It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder.

Overall, the A318 is over six metres shorter and around lighter than the A320. To compensate for the reduced moment arm, it has a larger vertical stabiliser. While initial concepts depicted the aircraft with a Boeing 737 style dorsal fin extension, the final design incorporated a fin tip extension, making it taller than the other A320 variants. Pilots who are trained on the other variants may fly the A318 with no further certification, since it features a common flight deck and the same type rating as its sister aircraft. The A318 is also referred to as the A318-100.

The A318 is available with a variety of different maximum take-off weights (MTOW) ranging from a , base model to a , version. When equipped with CFM56-5B8/P engines, the A318 is available with a MTOW. When equipped with CFM56-5B9/P engines, the A318 is available with a MTOW. The lower MTOW enables it to operate regional routes economically while sacrificing range and the higher MTOW allows it to complement other members of the A320 family on marginal routes. The lighter weight of the A318 gives it an operating range 10% greater than the A320, allowing it to serve some routes that the A320 would be unable to: London – New York, Perth–Auckland and Singapore–Tokyo, for instance. Its main use for airlines, however, is on short, low-density hops between medium-sized cities.

=== Steep approach capability ===

In March 2006, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certified a modified control software enhancement to the Airbus A318 designed to allow the aircraft to perform steep approaches. The aircraft is the largest commercial aircraft certified by EASA for steep approach operations. The software modifies the control laws of the aircraft when the steep approach function is selected by the crew, by automatically deploying some of the spoiler panels to provide additional drag when the aircraft is in the landing configuration. It also provides alternative aural alerts to the crew and modifies spoiler deployment automatically below on landing. The A318 steep approach procedure allows the aircraft to perform approaches at descent angles of up to 5.5°, as opposed to the standard 3° for a normal approach.

A test flight was conducted in May 2006 to prove the aircraft&#x27;s steep approach and short runway performance by landing at London City Airport, where such steep approaches are required. The test flight also confirmed the aircraft&#x27;s compatibility with the limited maneuvering and parking space at that airport. Subsequently, in August 2009 Airbus delivered the first A318 with steep approach capability to British Airways, which began operating the route the following month as its Club World London City service, eventually having two such aircraft capable of flights between London City Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. On the westbound leg from London, a stopover is necessary for refueling, which occurs at Shannon Airport, Ireland because weight restrictions are necessary in order to take off within the existing short runway length of London City Airport. On the eastbound leg from New York this limitation is not present and the aircraft can take all the fuel needed for the transatlantic route to London. As of November 2017, only one aircraft was serving the route, operated in a 32-seat all-business-class configuration. The second aircraft was retired on 31 July 2020, following the COVID-19 pandemic which deemed such type uneconomical.

== Operational history ==
Although final assembly of A320 family aircraft takes place in Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Tianjin, China; and Mobile, Alabama, US, final assembly of the Airbus A318 was in Hamburg, Germany. The maiden flight of the Airbus A318 took place from Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport on 15 January 2002. The first customer delivery was on 22 July 2003 to Frontier Airlines.

As of 30 September 2017, 67 A318s remained in service with five airlines, in addition to governments, executive and private jets and undisclosed operators. Frontier Airlines, the launch customer that acquired A318 aircraft between 2003 and 2007, had retired their last A318 by 2013.

<text>The White Mountains of California and Nevada are a triangular fault-block mountain range facing the Sierra Nevada across the upper Owens Valley. They extend for approximately as a greatly elevated plateau about wide on the south, narrowing to a point at the north, with elevations generally increasing south to north. The range&#x27;s broad southern end is near the community of Big Pine, where Westgard Pass and Deep Springs Valley separate it from the Inyo Mountains. The narrow northern end is at Montgomery Pass, where U.S. Route 6 crosses. The Fish Lake Valley lies east of the range; the southeast part of the mountains are separated from the Silver Peak Range by block faulting across the Furnace Creek Fault Zone, forming a feeder valley to Fish Lake Valley. The range lies within the eastern section of the Inyo National Forest.

==Ecology==
Ecologically, the White Mountains are like the other ranges in the Basin and Range Province; they are dry, but the upper slopes from hold open subalpine forests of Great Basin bristlecone pine on permeable dolomite and certain granite substrates and limber pine on less permeable rocky substrates. Middle slopes from have somewhat denser stands of piñon pine and Utah juniper. These upper and lower conifer zones are often separated by a zone of mountain mahogany brush. Various subspecies of sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia tridentata&quot;) extend from surrounding valleys to the lower alpine zone.
A bristlecone pine, named Methuselah, located within the mountain range is the oldest known, verified living tree in the world, at years old. Pine nuts from piñon pine stands were harvested as a winter staple food by Paiute Indians whose descendants still live in adjacent valleys.

The White Mountains also have small remnant groves of lodgepole pine, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, Sierra juniper and aspen including an unusual dwarf variety. These species are common in the nearby and wetter Sierra Nevada range west of the Owens Valley and must have been more widespread in the White Mountains until Holocene droughts extirpated them in most of this drier range. A number of plant species are endemic to the White Mountains, including the White Mountains horkelia, &quot;Horkelia hispidula&quot;.

Fauna include two herds of bighorn sheep, mule deer, marmots and feral horses. Permanent streams have no native fish, but there are naturalized populations of trout including rare Paiute cutthroat trout which is protected from angling. Birds include Clark&#x27;s nutcracker and other Corvidae which eat and cache pine nuts.

==History==
Cattle from ranches in surrounding valleys are still grazed under permit as high as the alpine zone. Historically sheep were also grazed in large numbers, introducing diseases from which the native Bighorn Sheep populations are still slowly recovering. Before European colonization of surrounding valleys in the mid 19th century, Paiute Indians occupied summer hunting camps up to about , leaving ruins of archeological interest.

==Geography==

The highest point in the range is White Mountain Peak, which at is the third-highest summit in California. This peak is actually an extinct volcano rising about above the plateau surface. The summit is composed of Mesozoic metavolcanic rock – lava lifted and melted by rising granite. The volcano itself is long since gone.
The White Mountains are the highest range completely inside the Great Basin, although the adjacent Sierra Nevada Range along the basin&#x27;s western edge has two higher summits.
The entire range is within the Inyo National Forest.

===Climate===
Mount Barcroft is a mountain peak about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) south of White Mountain Peak.

==Hiking==
A four-wheel drive road reaches the summit of White Mountain Peak from the south to service the summit laboratory of the White Mountain Research Center. The road is normally gated seven miles from the summit at an elevation of , making this California&#x27;s easiest summit. 

North of White Mountain Peak, two sharp arêtes alternate along the crest with the broad &quot;whalebacks&quot; plateau of Pellisier Flats with about six more summits over . Pellisier Flats is a wide sloping bench at the 13000 foot level with rocky fields and short alpine vegetation. The bench includes Mt. Hogue at 12,743 ft. and further north Mt. Dubois at 13,559 ft., the high point on the plateau. Pellisier Flats is the broad spine of the White Mountains.

The crest crosses the California–Nevada state line just south of a final high summit at Boundary Peak , Nevada&#x27;s high point. Boundary Peak is the &quot;prow&quot; of the triangular fault block. It has views directly down into valleys to the west, north and east that are hidden by the increasing width of the high plateau to the south. North of Boundary Peak the range rapidly loses altitude and ends at Montgomery Pass.

The west face of the White Mountains rises steeply out of Owens Valley. Climbing to any summit from this direction is a scramble with about elevation gain. Eastern slopes are somewhat gentler and have numerous cirques left by Pleistocene glaciers and even a few snowfields persisting through most summers. Most of these cirques are entered or approached by jeep roads and offer scenic yet non-technical routes to the crest.

<doc id="340528" wikidata="Q1848958" url="?curid=340528" title="Chesterton, Cambridge">
<text>Chesterton is a suburb in the northeast corner of Cambridge, in the Cambridge district, in the county of Cambridgeshire, England, north of Cambridge station, on the north bank of the River Cam.

==History==
Archaeological evidence indicates that the area that is now Chesterton has been inhabited since at least the Bronze Age. In Anglo-Saxon times Chesterton formed part of a larger vill spanning the River Cam. The rest of the vill became the borough of Cambridge sometime after the 8th century, but Chesterton was excluded from the early borough.

Chesterton was an ancient parish. The parish included the village and adjoining rural areas generally to the north of it; at the western end of the parish it included Cambridge Castle. Chesterton was governed by its parish vestry and manorial courts in the same way as most rural areas until 1880, when the parish was made a local government district, governed by an elected local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Cambridge Borough Council made numerous attempts to annex Chesterton; on three occasions between 1897 and 1909 the electorate of Chesterton voted against it being absorbed into Cambridge.

Chesterton Urban District was abolished in 1912. The more urban southern third of the parish, including the original village, was then absorbed into the borough of Cambridge, and the (then) more rural north of the parish was transferred to the neighbouring parish of Milton. The reduced civil parish of Chesterton continued to exist after 1912 covering just the parts of Chesterton which had been incorporated into Cambridge, but as an urban parish it had no longer had a council of its own. The civil parish of Chesterton was abolished in 1923 when all the parishes in the borough of Cambridge were united into a single parish. In 1921, the last census before its abolition, Chesterton parish had a population of 11,611. The more rural parts of the old Chesterton parish which had been transferred to Milton in 1912 were brought into the borough of Cambridge in a subsequent boundary review in 1934, and were developed during the 20th century with the growing suburbs of Cambridge.

A large housing association estate makes up part of the East Chesterton area.

== Governance ==
Chesterton contains two electoral wards (West Chesterton and East Chesterton) in the city of Cambridge. The total population of both wards at the 2021 Census was 18,620, representing a rise of 2.7% in ten years since the 2021 Census. These are roughly the same as the area normally called Chesterton: specifically the land north of the River Cam, east of Castle Hill and south of the Arbury and King&#x27;s Hedges estates.

City councillors for the East Chesterton ward are Gerri Bird, Alice Gilderdale and Baiju Thittala. City councillors for the West Chesterton ward are Sam Carling, Richard Swift and Rachel Wade. As county council divisions are different from city council wards, parts of the Chesterton area are covered by the Chesterton ward councillor Gerri Bird and Castle ward councillor Catherine Rae.

== Transport ==
Buses run seven times an hour to Cambridge city centre and six times an hour to each of Milton and Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital.

Milton Road (the A1309 and A1134) is the major arterial road through Chesterton, linking the centre of Cambridge to the southwest with the A14 road to the northeast.

Cambridge North railway station, built on the edge of East Chesterton, became operational in May 2017, something that had been campaigned for by numerous local politicians for decades.

== Notable people ==
*Horace Gray (1874–1938), cricketer
*Leo Reid (1888–1938), cricketer
*Veronica Volkersz (1917–2000) aviator, Air Transport Auxiliary pilot in the Second World War, first woman to fly an operational jet fighter

<text>Australian art is a broad spectrum of art created in or about Australia, or by Australians overseas, spanning from prehistoric times to the present day. The art forms include, but are not limited to, Aboriginal, Colonial, Landscape, Atelier, and Contemporary art. 

The visual arts in Australia have a rich and extensive history, with Aboriginal art dating back at least 30,000 years. The country has been the birthplace of many notable artists from both Western and Indigenous Australian schools. These include the late-19th-century Heidelberg School plein air painters, the Antipodeans, the Central Australian Hermannsburg School watercolorists, and the Western Desert Art Movement. The Australian art scene also features significant examples of High modernism and Postmodern art.

==History==
===Indigenous Australia===

The ancestors of Aboriginal Australians are believed to have arrived in Australia as early as 60,000 years ago, and evidence of Indigenous Australian art in Australia can be traced back at least 30,000 years. Examples of ancient Aboriginal rock artworks can be found throughout the continent. Notable examples can be found in national parks, such as those of the UNESCO listed sites at Uluru and Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, and the Gwion Gwion rock paintings in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Rock art can also be found within protected parks in urban areas such as Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park in Sydney. The Sydney rock engravings are approximately 5000 to 200 years old. Murujuga in Western Australia has the Friends of Australian Rock Art advocating its preservation, and the numerous engravings there were heritage listed in 2007.

In terms of age and abundance, cave art in Australia is comparable to that of Lascaux and Altamira in Europe, and Aboriginal art is believed to be the oldest continuing tradition of art in the world. There are three major regional styles: the geometric style found in Central Australia, Tasmania, the Kimberley and Victoria known for its concentric circles, arcs and dots; the simple figurative style found in Queensland; the complex figurative style found in Arnhem Land which includes X-Ray art. These designs generally carry significance linked to the spirituality of the Dreamtime.
William Barak ( 1824–1903) was one of the last traditionally educated of the Wurundjeri-Willam people who come from the district now incorporating the city of Melbourne. He remains notable for his artworks which recorded traditional Aboriginal ways for the education of Westerners (which remain on permanent exhibition at the Ian Potter Centre of the National Gallery of Victoria and the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery). Margaret Preston (1875–1963) was among the early non-indigenous painters to incorporate Aboriginal influences in her works. Albert Namatjira (1902–1959) is a famous Australian artist and an Arrernte man. His landscapes inspired the Hermannsburg School of art. Elizabeth Durack&#x27;s works, which notably fuse Western and indigenous influences, are significant. Since the 1970s, indigenous artists have employed the use of acrylic paints – with styles such as the Western Desert Art Movement becoming globally renowned 20th-century art movements.

The National Gallery of Australia exhibits a great many indigenous art works, including those of the Torres Strait Islands who are known for their traditional sculpture and headgear. The Art Gallery of New South Wales has an extensive collection of indigenous Australian art. In May 2011, the Director of the Place, Evolution, and Rock Art Heritage Unit (PERAHU) at Griffith University, Paul Taçon, called for the creation of a national database for rock art. Paul Taçon launched the &quot;Protect Australia&#x27;s Spirit&quot; campaign in May 2011 with the Australian actor Jack Thompson. This campaign aims to create the very first fully resourced national archive to bring together information about rock art sites, as well as planning for future rock art management and conservation. The National Rock Art Institute would bring together existing rock art expertise from Griffith University, Australian National University, and the University of Western Australia if they were funded by philanthropists, big business and government. Rock Art Research is published twice a year and also covers international scholarship of rock art.

===Early European depictions===

The first artistic representations of the Australia scene by European artists were mainly natural history illustrations, depicting the distinctive flora and fauna of the land for scientific purposes, and the topography of the coast. Sydney Parkinson, the botanical illustrator on James Cook&#x27;s 1770 voyage that first charted the eastern coastline of Australia, made a large number of such drawings under the direction of naturalist Joseph Banks. Many of these drawings were met with scepticism when taken back to Europe, for example claims that the platypus was a hoax. In the form of copies and reproductions, George Stubbs&#x27; 1772 paintings &quot;Portrait of a Large Dog&quot; and &quot;The Kongouro from New Holland&quot;—depicting a dingo and kangaroo respectively—were the first images of Australian fauna to be widely disseminated in Britain.

===British colonization (1788–1850)===
Early Western art in Australia, from British colonisation in 1788 onwards, is often narrated as the gradual shift from a European sense of light to an Australian one. The lighting in Australia is notably different from that of Europe, and early attempts at landscapes attempted to reflect this. It has also been one of transformation, where artistic ideas originating from beyond (primarily Europe) gained new meaning and purpose when transplanted into the new continent and the emerging society.

Despite Banks&#x27; suggestions, no professional natural-history artist sailed on the First Fleet in 1788. Until the turn of the century all drawings made in the colony were crafted by soldiers, including British naval officers George Raper and John Hunter, and convict artists, including Thomas Watling. However, many of these drawings are by unknown artists, most notably the Port Jackson Painter. Most are in the style of naval draughtsmanship, and cover natural history topics, specifically birds, and a few depict the infant colony itself.
Several professional natural-history illustrators accompanied expeditions in the early 19th century, including Ferdinand Bauer, who travelled with Matthew Flinders, and Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, who travelled with a French expedition led by Nicolas Baudin. The first resident professional artist was John Lewin, who arrived in 1800 and published two volumes of natural history art. Ornithologist John Gould was renowned for his illustrations of the country&#x27;s birds. In the late 19th century Harriet and Helena Scott were highly respected natural history illustrators
Lewin&#x27;s &quot;Platypus&quot; (1808) represents the fine detail and scientific observation displayed by many of these early painters.

As well as inspiration in natural history, there were some ethnographic portraiture of Aboriginal Australians, particularly in the 1830s. Artists included Augustus Earle in New South Wales and Benjamin Duterrau, Robert Dowling and the sculptor Benjamin Law, recording images of Aboriginal Tasmanians.

The most significant landscape artist of this era was John Glover. Heavily influenced by 18th-century European landscape painters, such as Claude Lorraine and Salvator Rosa, his works captured the distinctive Australian features of open country, fallen logs, and blue hills.

Conrad Martens (1801–1878) worked from 1835 to 1878 as a professional artist, painting many landscapes and was commercially successful. His work has been regarded as softening the landscape to fit European sensibilities. His watercolour studies of Sydney Harbour are well regarded, and seen as introducing Romantic ideals to his paintings. Martens is also remembered for accompanying scientist Charles Darwin on HMS Beagle (as had Augustus Earle).

===Gold rushes and expansion (1851–1885)===

From 1851, the Victorian gold rush resulted in a huge influx of settlers and new wealth. S. T. Gill (1818–1880) documented life on the Australian gold fields, however the colonial art market primarily desired landscape paintings, which were commissioned by wealthy landowners or merchants wanting to record their material success.

William Piguenit&#x27;s (1836–1914) &quot;Flood in the Darling&quot; was acquired by the National Gallery of New South Wales in 1895.

Some of the artists of note included Eugene von Guerard, Nicholas Chevalier, William Strutt, John Skinner Prout and Knud Bull.
Louis Buvelot was a key figure in landscape painting in the later period. He was influenced by the Barbizon school painters, and so using a &quot;plein air&quot; technique, and a more domesticated and settled view of the land, in contrast to the emphasis on strangeness or danger prevalent in earlier painters. This approach, together with his extensive teaching influence, have led his to dubbed the &quot;Father of Landscape Painting in Australia&quot;.

A few attempts at art exhibitions were made in the 1840s, which attracted a number of artists but were commercial failures. By the 1850s, however, regular exhibitions became popular, with a variety of art types represented. The first of these exhibitions was in 1854 in Melbourne. An art museum, which eventually became the National Gallery of Victoria, was founded in 1861, and it began to collect Australian works as well as gathering a collection of European masters. Crucially, it also opened an art school, important for the following generations of Australian-born and raised artists.

Henry James Johnstone (also known as H. J. Johnstone), a professional photographer and student of Buvelot, painted the large-scale bush scene &quot;Evening Shadows&quot; (1880), the first acquisition of the Art Gallery of South Australia and possibly Australia&#x27;s most reproduced painting.

===Australian impressionists (1885–1900)===

The origins of a distinctly Australian painting tradition is often associated with the Heidelberg School of the late 19th century. Named after a camp Tom Roberts and Arthur Streeton established in Heidelberg (then a rural suburb on the outskirts of Melbourne), these painters, together with Frederick McCubbin, Charles Conder and others, began an impressionistic &quot;plein air&quot; approach to the Australian landscape that remains embedded in Australia&#x27;s popular consciousness, both in and outside the art world.
Many of their most famous works depict scenes of pastoral and outback Australia. Central themes of their art include manual labour, conquering the land, and an idealisation of the rural pioneer. By the 1890s most Australians were city-dwellers, as were the artists themselves, and a romantic view of pioneer life gave great power and popularity to images such as &quot;Shearing the Rams&quot;. In this work Roberts uses formal composition and strong realism to dignify the shearers whilst the relative anonymity of the men and their subdued expressions, elevate their work as the real subject, rather that the specific individuals portrayed.

In their portrayal of the nobility of rural life, the Heidelberg artists reveal their debt to Millet, Bastien-Lepage and Courbet, but the techniques and aims of the French Impressionists provide more direct inspiration and influenced their actual practise. In their early and extremely influential Exhibition of 9 by 5 Impressions of small sketches, their impressionistic programme was clear, as evidenced from their catalogue: &quot;An effect is only momentary: so an impressionist tries to find his place... it has been the object of artists to render faithfully, and thus obtain first records of effects widely differing, and often of very fleeting character.&quot;

Other significant painters associated with the Heidelberg painters were Walter Withers, who won the inaugural Wynne Prize in 1896, and Jane Sutherland, a student of McCubbin. Born and raised in Sydney, impressionist John Russell spent much of his career in Europe, where he befriended the likes of Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet. He also wrote letters home to his friend, Tom Roberts, updating him on developments in French impressionism.

===Federation era and World War I (1901–1918)===
In 1901, the six self-governing Australian colonies federated to form a unified nation. Artists such as Hans Heysen and Elioth Gruner built on the Australian landscape tradition of the Heidelberg painters, creating grand, nationalist pastoral landscapes. Others moved on to successful careers in London and Paris, such as Rupert Bunny and Hugh Ramsay. 
=== 1920s onwards ===
Among the public, through the 1920s, modified forms of Impressionism were popular, with Elioth Gruner being considered the last of the Australian Impressionists. The Australian Tonalist movement, originating in the writings and teaching of Max Meldrum, followed a &#x27;scientific&#x27; transcription of tonal relations, making &#x27;impressionism&#x27; a system, and opposed Modernist art then emerging pre-WW2 in the Angry Penguins and the Heide Circle influenced by refugees from Europe, and Australian-born artists&#x27; visits to England and France. Conservatives&#x27; attitudes to &#x27;modern art&#x27; prevailed until the 1960s, institutionalised in the Australian Academy of Art (1937–1947), opposed by such groups as the Contemporary Art Society (established 1938 and continuing).

The 1950s restored an interest in the Outback as subject matter in Australian art. Russell Drysdale and Sidney Nolan toured the interior, sponsored by newspapers to document drought. They and Albert Tucker, in his &quot;Explorer&quot; series, sought to capture the ancient strangeness and a cruel infinity of the central Australian landscape.

Splatt and Burton (1977) consider the 1960s a period in which public attention was being drawn to urban bushland and that landscape paintings of the 1970s carried through on the themes of environmental preservation and threats of destruction.

== List of artists ==
== Art museums and galleries in Australia ==


== Institutions ==

Australia has major art museums and galleries subsidised by the national and state governments, as well as private art museums and small university and municipal galleries. The National Gallery of Australia, the Gallery of Modern Art and the Art Gallery of New South Wales have major strengths in collecting the art of the Asia Pacific Region. Others include the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, which has a significant Australian collection of Western art. Museum of Contemporary Art Australia, Sydney, and the privately owned Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania and White Rabbit Gallery in Sydney are widely regarded as autonomously discerning collections of international contemporary art.

Other institutions include the Art Gallery of South Australia in Adelaide, Newcastle Art Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, the Canberra Museum and Gallery, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in Hobart, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in Darwin, and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth. A network of regional public galleries have existed since the mid-1800s and one, Castlemaine Art Museum, is unique in specialising in Australian art. The State Library of New South Wales holds a significant collection comprising more than a quarter of a million artworks, many from the colonial period. More material is held by other national and state libraries.

== Art market ==

The boom and bust cycle in contemporary art is evident in the 1980s colonial art boom ending at the time of the 1987 stock market crash and the exit of many artists and dealers, followed by the 2000s boom in Aboriginal dot painting and Australian late modernist painting, which ended at the time of the global financial crisis and growing collector and public interest in the international contemporary art circuit.

A 5% resale royalty scheme commenced in 2010 under which artists receive 5% of the sale price when eligible artworks are resold commercially for $1000 or more. Between 10 June 2010 and 15 May 2013, the scheme generated over $1.5 million in royalties for 610 artists. Some buyers object to paying any resale royalty while others do not mind a royalty going directly to the artists. However, they worry about further red tape and bureaucratic interference.

In 2014/15 there was a rediscovery of colonial art at auction. Affordable 20th-century rural scene painting is buoyant. While the inflated northern hemisphere art markets had anticipating a massive correction in the Australian art market which transitioned to the middle market.

Socially oriented art events such as art fairs and biennials have continued to grow in size and popularity in the contemporary art scene.

The smaller commercial galleries have struggled to remain in business in the 2010s in spite of a functioning economy, although there is little consensus on the reasons for this.

A new market has arisen in China, where Australian artists are selling works in a traditionally local market: &quot;While the Chinese have always had a passion for traditional Chinese art, according to global auction house Sotheby&#x27;s, the surging interest in contemporary international art is a recent trend.&quot;

The market for Aboriginal art is still very strong, on the national and international stage, since becoming a solid financial investment in the 1980s. Not only do all the regional and State Galleries acquire significant collections of Aboriginal art, but private galleries are showing featured artists abroad. Aboriginal artists are also represented in all the major landscape prizes Australia. In 2019, &quot;the Wynne prize, worth $50,000, was won by Sylvia Ken for her painting Seven Sisters – marking the fourth year in a row that the landscape prize has been won by Indigenous artists.&quot;

==Australian visual arts in other countries==

The museum for Australian Aboriginal art &#x27;La grange&#x27; in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, was one of the few museums in Europe that dedicated itself entirely to Aboriginal art.

<text>The White Mountains of Arizona are a mountain range and mountainous region in the eastern part of the state, near the border with New Mexico; they are a continuation from the west of the Arizona transition zone–Mogollon Rim, with the Rim ending in western New Mexico. The White Mountains are a part of the Colorado Plateau high country of Northeast Arizona, the Navajo Nation, with the rest of the Plateau in eastern Utah, northwest New Mexico, and southwestern Colorado. Nearby communities include Show Low, Pinetop-Lakeside, Greer, St. Johns, Springerville, Eagar, and McNary. Much of the range is within the Fort Apache Indian Reservation.

The highest summit is Mount Baldy, with an elevation of .
The mountains are drained to the south by several tributaries of the Salt River, and to the north by the Little Colorado River. There are several small lakes.

The part of the White Mountains outside the reservation is in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.

The White Mountains are the location of the 1993 motion picture “Fire In The Sky”, a true story of five Arizona loggers accused of committing a hoax or murderous crime after they report a crew member’s (Travis Walton) mysterious disappearance and possible alien abduction, occurring in 1975.

<doc id="340537" wikidata="Q335255" url="?curid=340537" title="Curzon Line">
<text>The Curzon Line was a proposed demarcation line between the Second Polish Republic and the Soviet Union, two new states emerging after World War I. Based on a suggestion by Herbert James Paton, it was first proposed in 1919 by Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, to the Supreme War Council as a diplomatic basis for a future border agreement.

The line became a major geopolitical factor during World War II, when the USSR invaded eastern Poland, resulting in the split of Poland&#x27;s territory between the USSR and Nazi Germany roughly along the Curzon Line in accordance with final rounds of secret negotiations surrounding the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. After the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Operation Barbarossa, the Allies did not agree that Poland&#x27;s future eastern border should be changed from the pre-war status quo in 1939 until the Tehran Conference. Churchill&#x27;s position changed after the Soviet victory at the Battle of Kursk.

Following a private agreement at the Tehran Conference, confirmed at the 1945 Yalta Conference, the Allied leaders Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Stalin issued a statement affirming the use of the Curzon Line, with some five-to-eight-kilometre variations, as the eastern border between Poland and the Soviet Union. When Churchill proposed to annex parts of Eastern Galicia, including the city of Lviv, to Poland&#x27;s territory (following Line B), Stalin argued that the Soviet Union could not demand less territory for itself than the British Government had reconfirmed previously several times. The Allied arrangement involved compensation for this loss via the incorporation of formerly German areas (the so-called Recovered Territories) into Poland. As a result, the current border between Poland and the countries of Belarus and Ukraine is an approximation of the Curzon Line.
== Early history ==

At the end of World War I, the Second Polish Republic reclaimed its sovereignty following the disintegration of the occupying forces of three neighbouring empires. Imperial Russia was amid the Russian Civil War after the October Revolution, Austria-Hungary split and went into decline, and the German Reich bowed to pressure from the victorious forces of the Allies of World War I. The Allied victors agreed that an independent Polish state should be recreated from territories previously part of the Russian, the Austro-Hungarian and the German empires, after 123 years of upheavals and military partitions by them.

The Supreme War Council tasked the Commission on Polish Affairs with recommending Poland&#x27;s eastern border, based on spoken language majority, which became later known as the Curzon Line. Their result was created December 8, 1919. The Allies forwarded it as an armistice line several times during the subsequent Polish-Soviet Wars, most notably in a note from the British government to the Soviets signed by Lord Curzon of Kedleston, the British Foreign Secretary. Both parties disregarded the line when the military situation lay in their favour, and it did not play a role in establishing the Polish–Soviet border in 1921. Instead, the final Peace of Riga (or Treaty of Riga) provided Poland with almost of land that was, on average, about east of the Curzon Line.

===Characteristics===
The Northern half of the Curzon Line lay approximately along the border which was established between the Kingdom of Prussia and the Russian Empire in 1797, after the Third Partition of Poland, which was the last border recognised by the United Kingdom. Along most of its length, the line at least in principle was intended to follow a generally ethnic or ethnolinguistic boundary - areas West of the line generally contained an overall Polish majority while areas to its East less so- borderland areas were inhabited by Ukrainians, Belarusians, Poles, Jews and Lithuanians. Its 1920 northern extension into Lithuania divided the area disputed between Poland and Lithuania. There were two versions of the southern portion of the line: &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Version &quot;B&quot; allocated Lwów (&quot;Lviv&quot;) to Poland.

==End of World War I==
The US President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points included the statement &quot;An independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea...&quot; Article 87 of the Versailles Treaty stipulated that &quot;The boundaries of Poland not laid down in the present Treaty will be subsequently determined by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers.&quot; In accordance with these declarations, the Supreme War Council tasked the Commission on Polish Affairs with proposing Poland&#x27;s eastern boundaries in lands that were inhabited by a mixed population of Poles, Lithuanians, Ukrainians and Belarusians. The Commission issued its recommendation on 22 April; its proposed Russo-Polish borders were close to those of the 19th-century Congress Poland.

The Supreme Council continued to debate the issue for several months. On 8 December, the Council published a map and description of the line along with an announcement that it recognized &quot;Poland&#x27;s right to organize a regular administration of the territories of the former Russian Empire situated to the West of the line described below.&quot; At the same time, the announcement stated the Council was not &quot;...prejudging the provisions which must in the future define the eastern frontiers of Poland&quot; and that &quot;the rights that Poland may be able to establish over the territories situated to the East of the said line are expressly reserved.&quot; The announcement had no immediate impact, although the Allies recommended its consideration in an August 1919 proposal to Poland, which was ignored.


==Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921==

Polish forces pushed eastward, taking Kiev in May 1920. Following a strong Soviet counteroffensive, Prime Minister Władysław Grabski sought Allied assistance in July. Under pressure, he agreed to a Polish withdrawal to the 1919 version of the line and, in Galicia, an armistice near the current line of battle. On , Curzon signed a telegram sent to the Bolshevik government proposing that a ceasefire be established along the line, and his name was subsequently associated with it.

Curzon&#x27;s July 1920 proposal differed from the 19 December announcement in two significant ways. The December note did not address the issue of Galicia, since it had been a part of the Austrian Empire rather than the Russian, nor did it address the Polish-Lithuanian dispute over the Vilnius Region, since those borders were demarcated at the time by the Foch Line. The July 1920 note specifically addressed the Polish-Lithuanian dispute by mentioning a line running from Grodno to Vilnius (Wilno) and thence north to Daugavpils, Latvia (Dynaburg). It also mentioned Galicia, where earlier discussions had resulted in the alternatives of Line A and Line B. The note endorsed Line A, which included Lwów and its nearby oil fields within Russia. This portion of the line did not correspond to the current line of battle in Galicia, as per Grabski&#x27;s agreement, and its inclusion in the July note has lent itself to disputation.

On 17 July, the Soviets responded to the note with a refusal. Georgy Chicherin, representing the Soviets, commented on the delayed interest of the British for a peace treaty between Russia and Poland. He agreed to start negotiations as long as the Polish side asked for it. The Soviet side at that time offered more favourable border solutions to Poland than the ones offered by the Curzon Line. In August the Soviets were defeated by the Poles just outside Warsaw and forced to retreat. During the ensuing Polish offensive, the Polish government repudiated Grabski&#x27;s agreement with regard to the line on the grounds that the Allies had not delivered support or protection.

===Peace of Riga===
At the March 1921 Treaty of Riga the Soviets conceded a frontier well to the east of the Curzon Line, where Poland had conquered a great part of the Vilna Governorate (1920/1922), including the town of Wilno (&quot;Vilnius&quot;), and East Galicia (1919), including the city of Lwów, as well as most of the region of Volhynia (1921). The treaty provided Poland with almost of land that was, on average, about east of the Curzon Line. The Polish-Soviet border was recognised by the League of Nations in 1923 and confirmed by various Polish-Soviet agreements. Within the annexed regions, Poland founded several administrative districts, such as the Volhynian Voivodeship, the Polesie Voivodeship, and the Wilno Voivodeship.

As a concern of possible expansion of Polish territory, Polish politicians traditionally could be subdivided into two opposite groups advocating contrary approaches: restoration of Poland based on its former western territories one side and, alternatively, restoration of Poland based on its previous holdings in the east on the other.

During the first quarter of the 20th century, a representative of the first political group was Roman Dmowski, an adherent of the pan-slavistic movement and author of several political books and publications of some importance, who approached the issue pragmatically, but advocating for incorporation of available land based on a ethnographic principle combined with a theory of easy assimilation of Belarusians within a centralised Polish state- the task potentially to be shared with Russia concerning Belarusians beyond the border which he viewed it would be possible to incorporate and assimilate.

This resulted in a modification of the Dmowski Line in negotiations for the Treaty of Riga, in which the Polish delegation (consisting of a majority of parliamentary representatives, Dmowski’s Zjednoczenie Ludowo-Narodowe being the strongest party) unilaterally ceding claims to the Minsk area without basis on the line of actual control, and despite it having a higher Polish-identified population (in absolute and proportionally) than many of the areas still claimed within the border. The goal is thought to be jeopardising Józef Piłsudski’s ambitions for creating a Polish-Belarusian federation, as a remnant of his ‘federationist idea’ (opposed to Dmowski’s ‘incorporation its idea’) with a Belarusian capital in Minsk. It was predicted that a Belarusian entity without Minsk would be deemed politically illegitimate and untenable to the local population. An anti-communist, but believing in the inevitability of a White victory in the Russian Civil War he wished to concentrate on resisting a more dangerous enemy of the Polish nation than Russia, which in his view was Germany.

The most powerful representative of the opposed group was Józef Piłsudski, a former socialist who was born in the Vilna Governorate annexed during the 1795 Third Partition of Poland by the Russian Empire, whose political vision was essentially a far-reaching restoration of the borders of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ideally in the form of a multinational federation. Because the Russian Empire had collapsed into a state of civil war following the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Soviet Army had been defeated and been weakened considerably at the end of World War I by Germany&#x27;s army, resulting in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Piłsudski took the chance and used military force in an attempt to realise his political vision by concentrating on the east and involving himself in the Polish–Soviet War.

==World War II==

The terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 provided for the partition of Poland along the line of the San, Vistula and Narew rivers which did not go along the Curzon Line but reached far beyond it and awarded the Soviet Union with territories of Lublin and near Warsaw. In September, after the military defeat of Poland, the Soviet Union annexed all territories east of the Curzon Line plus Białystok and Eastern Galicia. The territories east of this line were incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR and Ukrainian SSR after falsified referendums and hundreds of thousands of Poles and a lesser number of Jews were deported eastwards into the Soviet Union. In July 1941 these territories were seized by Nazi Germany in the course of the invasion of the Soviet Union. During the German occupation most of the Jewish population was deported or killed by the Germans.

In 1944, the Soviet armed forces recaptured eastern Poland from the Germans. The Soviets unilaterally declared a new frontier between the Soviet Union and Poland (approximately the same as the Curzon Line). The Polish government-in-exile in London bitterly opposed this, insisting on the &quot;Riga line&quot;. At the Tehran and Yalta conferences between Stalin and the western Allies, the allied leaders Roosevelt and Churchill asked Stalin to reconsider, particularly over Lwów, but he refused. During the negotiations at Yalta, Stalin posed the question &quot;Do you want me to tell the Russian people that I am less Russian than Lord Curzon?&quot; The altered Curzon Line thus became the permanent eastern border of Poland and was recognised by the western Allies in July 1945. The border was later adjusted several times, the biggest revision being in 1951.

When the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991, the Curzon Line became Poland&#x27;s eastern border with Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine.

== Ethnicity east of the Curzon Line until 1939 ==

The ethnic composition of these areas proved difficult to measure, both during the interwar period and after World War II. A 1944 article in &quot;The Times&quot; estimated that in 1931 between 2.2 and 2.5 million Poles lived east of the Curzon Line. According to historian Yohanan Cohen&#x27;s estimate, in 1939 the population in the territories of interwar Poland east of the Curzon Line gained via the Treaty of Riga totalled 12 million, consisting of over 5 million Ukrainians, between 3.5 and 4 million Poles, 1.5 million Belarusians, and 1.3 million Jews. During World War II, politicians gave varying estimates of the Polish population east of the Curzon Line that would be affected by population transfers. Winston Churchill mentioned &quot;3 to 4 million Poles east of the Curzon Line&quot;. Stanisław Mikołajczyk, then Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile, counted this population as 5 million.

Ukrainians and Belarusians if counted together composed the majority of the population of interwar Eastern Poland. The area also had a significant number of Jewish inhabitants. Poles constituted majorities in the main cities (followed by Jews) and in some rural areas, such as Vilnius region or Wilno Voivodeship.

After the Soviet deportation of Poles and Jews in 1939–1941 (see Polish minority in Soviet Union), The Holocaust and the ethnic cleansing of the Polish population of Volhynia and East Galicia by Ukrainian Nationalists, the Polish population in the territories had decreased considerably. The cities of Wilno, Lwów, Grodno and some smaller towns still had significant Polish populations. After 1945, the Polish population of the area east of the new Soviet-Polish border was in general confronted with the alternative either to accept a different citizenship or to emigrate. According to more recent research, about 3 million Roman Catholic Poles lived east of the Curzon Line within interwar Poland&#x27;s borders, of whom about 2.1 million to 2.2 million died, fled, emigrated or were expelled to the newly annexed German territories. There still exists a big Polish minority in Lithuania and a big Polish minority in Belarus today. The cities of Vilnius, Grodno and some smaller towns still have significant Polish populations. Vilnius District Municipality and Sapotskin region have a Polish majority.

Ukrainian nationalists continued their partisan war and were imprisoned by the Soviets and sent to the Gulag. There they revolted, actively participating in several uprisings (Kengir uprising, Norilsk uprising, Vorkuta uprising).

Polish population east of the Curzon Line before World War II can be estimated by adding together figures for Former Eastern Poland and for pre-1939 Soviet Union:
Two tables below show the linguistic (mother tongue) and religious structure of interwar South-Eastern Poland (nowadays part of Western Ukraine) and interwar North-Eastern Poland (nowadays part of Western Belarus and southern Lithuania) by county, according to the 1931 census.

===Largest cities and towns===

In 1931, according to the Polish National Census, the ten largest cities in Polish Eastern Borderlands were: Lwów (pop. 312,200), Wilno (pop. 195,100), Stanisławów (pop. 60,000), Grodno (pop. 49,700), Brześć nad Bugiem (pop. 48,400), Borysław (pop. 41,500), Równe (pop. 40,600), Tarnopol (pop. 35,600), Łuck (pop. 35,600) and Kołomyja (pop. 33,800).

In addition, Daugavpils (pop. 43,200 in 1930) in inter-war Latvia was also a major Polish community with 21% ethnic Polish inhabitants.

== Poles east of the Curzon Line after expulsion ==
Despite the expulsion of most ethnic Poles from the Soviet Union between 1944 and 1958, the Soviet census of 1959 still counted around 1.4 million ethnic Poles remaining in the USSR:

According to a more recent census, there were about 295,000 Poles in Belarus in 2009 (3.1% of the Belarus population).

== Ethnicity west of the Curzon Line until 1939 ==
According to Piotr Eberhardt, in 1939, the population of all territories between the Oder-Neisse Line and the Curzon Line—all territories which formed post-1945 Poland—totalled 32,337,800 inhabitants, of whom the largest groups were ethnic Poles (approximately 67%), ethnic Germans (approximately 25%), and Jews (2,254,300 or 7%), with 657,500 (2%) Ukrainians, 140,900 Belarusians and 47,000 people of all other ethnic groups also in the region. Much of the Ukrainian population was forcibly resettled after World War II to Soviet Ukraine or scattered in the new Polish Recovered Territories of Silesia, Pomerania, Lubusz Land, Warmia and Masuria in an ethnic cleansing by the Polish military in an operation called Operation Vistula.

<doc id="340539" wikidata="Q156111" url="?curid=340539" title="General Government">
<text>The General Government (, ; ; ), formally the General Governorate for the Occupied Polish Region (), was a German zone of occupation established after the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, Slovakia and the Soviet Union in 1939 at the onset of World War II. The newly occupied Second Polish Republic was split into three zones: the General Government in its centre, Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany in the west, and Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union in the east. The territory was expanded substantially in 1941, after the German Invasion of the Soviet Union, to include the new District of Galicia. The area of the &quot;Generalgouvernement&quot; roughly corresponded with the Austrian part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Third Partition of Poland in 1795.

The basis for the formation of the General Government was the &quot;Annexation Decree on the Administration of the Occupied Polish Territories&quot;. Announced by Hitler on October 8, 1939, it claimed that the Polish government had totally collapsed. This rationale was utilized by the German Supreme Court to reassign the identity of all Polish nationals as stateless subjects, with the exception of the ethnic Germans of interwar Poland—who, disregarding international law, were named the only rightful citizens of Nazi Germany.

The General Government was run by Germany as a separate administrative unit for logistical purposes. When the Wehrmacht forces invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), the area of the General Government was enlarged by the inclusion of the Polish regions previously annexed to the USSR. Within days East Galicia was overrun and incorporated into the District of Galicia. Until 1945, the General Government comprised much of central, southern, and southeastern Poland within its prewar borders (and of modern-day Western Ukraine), including the major Polish cities of Warsaw, Kraków, Lwów (now Lviv, renamed ), Lublin (see Lublin Reservation), Tarnopol (see history of Tarnopol Ghetto), Stanisławów (now Ivano-Frankivsk, renamed ; see Stanisławów Ghetto), Drohobycz, and Sambor (see Drohobycz and Sambor Ghettos) and others. Geographical locations were renamed in German.

The administration of the General Government was composed entirely of German officials, with the intent that the area was to be colonized by Germanic settlers who would reduce the local Polish population to the level of serfs before their eventual genocide. The Nazi German rulers of the had no intention of sharing power with the locals throughout the war, regardless of their ethnicity and political orientation. The authorities rarely mentioned the name &quot;Poland&quot; in legal correspondence. The only exception to this was the General Government&#x27;s Bank of Issue in Poland (, ).

==Name==
The full title of the regime in Germany until July 1940 was the , a name that is usually translated as &quot;General Government for the Occupied Polish Territories&quot;. Governor Hans Frank, on Hitler&#x27;s authority, shortened the name on 31 July 1940 to just .

An accurate English translation of , which is a borrowing from French, is &#x27;General Governorate&#x27;, cognate with the Dutch . A more accurate English translation of the French term in this context is not &#x27;government&#x27;, but &quot;governorate&quot;, which is a type of a territory that is administered centrally. In the French and Dutch original, the &#x27;General&#x27; in the name is a reference to the Estates-General, the central assembly which was given an authority to directly rule the territory. 

The Nazi designation of also gave a nod to the once existing , a civil entity created in the invaded Russian Empire territory by the German Empire during World War I. This district existed from 1914 to 1918 together with an Austro-Hungarian-controlled Military Government of Lublin alongside the short-lived Kingdom of Poland of 1916–1918, a similar rump state formed out of the then-Russian-controlled parts of Poland.

The General Government area was also known colloquially as the (&#x27;Remainder of Poland&#x27;).

==History==
After Germany&#x27;s attack on Poland, all areas occupied by the German army including the Free City of Danzig initially came under military rule. This area extended from the 1939 eastern border of Germany proper and of East Prussia up to the Bug River where the German armies had halted their advance and linked up with the Soviet Red Army in accordance with their secret pact against Poland.

The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact signed on 23 August 1939 had promised the vast territory between the Vistula and Bug rivers to the Soviet &quot;sphere of influence&quot; in divided Poland, while the two powers would have jointly ruled Warsaw. To settle the deviation from the original agreement, the German and Soviet representatives met again on September 28 to delineate a permanent border between the two countries. Under this revised version of the pact the territory concerned was exchanged for the inclusion in the Soviet sphere of Lithuania, which had originally fallen within the ambit of Germany. With the new agreement the entire central part of Poland, including the core ethnic area of the Poles, came under exclusively German control.
Hitler decreed the direct annexation to the German Reich of large parts of the occupied Polish territory in the western half of the German zone, in order to increase the Reich&#x27;s Lebensraum. Germany organized most of these areas as two new Reichsgaue: Danzig-West Prussia and Wartheland. The remaining three regions, the so-called areas of Zichenau, Eastern Upper Silesia and the Suwałki triangle, became attached to adjacent Gaue of Germany. Draconian measures were introduced by both RKF and HTO, to facilitate the immediate Germanization of the annexed territory, typically resulting in mass expulsions, especially in the Warthegau. The remaining parts of the former Poland were to become a German &quot;&quot; (March, borderland) as a frontier post of German rule in the east. A Führer&#x27;s decree of October 12, 1939 established the General Government; the decree came into force on October 26, 1939.

Hans Frank was appointed as the governor-general of the General Government. German authorities made a sharp contrast between the new Reich territory and a supposedly occupied rump state that could serve as a bargaining chip with the Western powers. The Germans established a closed border between the two German zones to heighten the difficulty of cross-frontier communication between the different segments of the Polish population.

The official name chosen for the new entity was the &quot;&quot; (General Government for the Occupied Polish Territories), then changed to the &quot;Generalgouvernement&quot; (General Government) by Frank&#x27;s decree of July 31, 1940. However, this name did not imply anything about the actual nature of the administration. The German authorities never regarded these Polish lands (apart from the short period of military administration during the actual invasion of Poland) as an occupied territory. The Nazis considered the Polish state to have effectively ceased to exist with its defeat in the September campaign.

Overall, 4 million of the 1939 population of the General Government area had lost their lives by the time the Soviet armed forces entered the area in late 1944. If the Polish underground killed a German, 50–100 Poles were executed by German police as a punishment and as a warning to other Poles. Most of the Jews, perhaps as many as two million, had also been rounded up and murdered. Germans destroyed Warsaw after the Warsaw Uprising. As the Soviets advanced through Poland in late 1944 the General Government collapsed. American troops captured Hans Frank, who had governed the region, in May 1945; he became one of the defendants at the Nuremberg Trials. During his trial he resumed his childhood practice of Catholicism and expressed repentance. Frank surrendered forty volumes of his diaries to the Tribunal; much evidence against him and others was gathered from them. He was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. On October 1, 1946, he was sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence was carried out on October 16.

==German intentions regarding the region==

The conversion of Warsaw into a &quot;model city&quot; was planned in 1940 and later, in similar ways like the conversion of Berlin was planned. In March 1941 Hans Frank informed his subordinates that Hitler had made the decision to &quot;turn this region into a purely German area within 15–20 years&quot;. He explained: &quot;Where 12 million Poles now live, is to be populated by 4 to 5 million Germans. The &quot;Generalgouvernement&quot; must become as German as the Rhineland.&quot; By 1942 Hitler and Frank had agreed that the Kraków (&quot;with its purely German capital&quot;) and Lublin districts would be the first areas for German colonists to re-populate. Hitler stated: &quot;When these two weak points have been strengthened, it should be possible to slowly drive back the Poles.&quot; Peculiar about these statements is the circumstance that there were not enough German settlers to even make the Wartheland &quot;as German as the Rhineland&quot;. According to notes from Martin Bormann German policy envisaged reducing lower-class Poles to the status of serfs, while deporting or otherwise eliminating the middle and upper classes and eventually replacing them with German colonists of the &quot;master race&quot;.

German bureaucrats drew up various plans regarding the future of the original population. One called for the deportation of about 20 million Poles to western Siberia, and the Germanisation of 4 to 5 million; although deportation in reality meant many Poles were to be put to death, a small number would be &quot;Germanized&quot;, and young Poles of desirable qualities would be kidnapped and raised in Germany. In the General Government, all secondary education was abolished and all Polish cultural institutions closed.

In 1943, the government selected the Zamojskie area for further Germanization on account of its fertile black soil, and German colonial settlements were planned. Zamość was initially renamed by the government to &#x27; (Himmler City), which was later changed to &#x27; (Plough City), both names were not implemented. Most of the Polish population was expelled by the Nazi occupation authorities with documented brutality. Himmler intended the city of Lublin to have a German population of 20% to 25% by the beginning of 1944, and of 30% to 40% by the following year, at which time Lublin was to be declared a German city and given a German mayor.

===Territorial dissection===
Nazi planners never definitively resolved the question of the exact territorial reorganization of the Polish provinces in the event of German victory in the east. Germany had already annexed large parts of western pre-war Poland (8 October 1939) before the establishment of the General Government (26 October 1939), and the remaining region was also intended to be directly incorporated into the German Reich at some future date. The Nazi leadership discussed numerous initiatives with this aim.

The earliest such proposal (October/November 1939) called for the establishment of a separate &quot;Reichsgau Beskidenland&quot; which would encompass several southern sections of the Polish territories conquered in 1939 (around 18,000 km2), stretching from the area to the west of Kraków to the San river in the east. At this time Germany had not yet directly annexed the Łódź area, and Łódź (rather than Kraków) served as the capital of the General Government.

In November 1940, Gauleiter Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland argued that the counties of Tomaschow Mazowiecki and Petrikau should be transferred from the General Government&#x27;s Radom district to his Gau. Hitler agreed, but since Frank refused to surrender the counties, the resolution of the border question was postponed until after the final victory.

Upon hearing of the German plans to create a &quot;Gau of the Goths&quot; (&#x27;) in the Crimea and the Southern Ukraine after the start (June 1941) of Operation Barbarossa, Frank himself expressed his intention to turn the district under his control into a German province called the &#x27; (Gau of the Vandals) in a speech he gave on 16 December 1941.

When Frank unsuccessfully attempted to resign his position on 24 August 1942, Nazi Party Secretary Martin Bormann tried to advance a project to dissolve the General Government altogether and to partition its territory into a number of Reichsgaue, arguing that only this method could guarantee the territory&#x27;s Germanization, while also claiming that Germany could economically exploit the area more effectively, particularly as a source of food. He suggested separating the &quot;more restful&quot; population of the formerly Austrian territories (because this part of Poland had been under German-Austrian rule for a long period of time it was deemed more racially acceptable) from the rest of the Poles, and cordoning off the city of Warsaw as the center of &quot;criminality&quot; and underground resistance activity.
Ludwig Fischer (governor of Warsaw from 1939 to 1945) opposed the proposed administrative streamlining resulting from these discussions. Fischer prepared his own project in his Main Office for Spatial Ordering (&quot;&quot;) located in Warsaw. He suggested the establishment of the three provinces &quot;Beskiden&quot;, &quot;Weichselland&quot; (&quot;Vistula Land&quot;), and &quot;Galizien&quot; (Galicia and Chełm) by dividing the Radom and Lublin districts between them. &quot;Weichselland&quot; was to have a &quot;Polish character&quot;, &quot;Galizien&quot; a &quot;Ukrainian&quot; one, and the &quot;Beskiden&quot;-province to provide a German &quot;admixture&quot; (i.e. colonial settlement). Further territorial planning carried out by this Warsaw-based organization under Major Dr. Ernst Zvanetti in a May 1943 study to demarcate the eastern border of &quot;Central Europe&quot; (i.e. the Greater German Reich) with the &quot;Eastern European landmass&quot; proposed an eastern German border along the &quot;line Memel-Odessa&quot;.

In this context Zvanetti&#x27;s study proposed a re-ordering of the &quot;Eastern Gaue&quot; into three geopolitical blocs:

*a western group comprising the &quot;Gaue&quot; &quot;Danzig-Westpreußen&quot;, &quot;Wartheland&quot;, and &quot;Schlesien&quot; (Silesia)
*a central group with the &quot;Gaue&quot; &quot;Ostpreußen&quot; (East Prussia), &quot;Südpreußen&quot; (South Prussia), &quot;Litzmannstadt&quot; (Łódź), and &quot;Beskidenland&quot;
*the eastern group with the &quot;Gau Südostpreußen&quot; (South-East Prussia) and including &quot;Wolhynien&quot; (Volhynia and the Lublin district), &quot;Galizien&quot;, and &quot;Podolien&quot; (Podolia).

==Administration==

The General Government was administered by a General-Governor () aided by the Office of the General-Governor (; changed on December 9, 1940 to the Government of the General Government, ). For the entire period of the General Government&#x27;s existence there was only one General-Governor: Dr. Hans Frank. The NSDAP structure in General Government was &quot;Arbeitsbereich Generalgouvernement&quot; led by Frank.

The Office was headed by Chief of the Government (), Josef Bühler, who was also the State Secretary (). From October 1939 to May 1940, Arthur Seyss-Inquart was the Deputy General-Governor. After his departure, Bühler served as Frank&#x27;s deputy through January 1945. Several other individuals had powers to issue legislative decrees in addition to the General-Governor, most notably the Higher SS and Police Leader of the General Government (SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger; from October 1943: SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Wilhelm Koppe).


The General Government had no international recognition. The territories it administered were never either in whole or part intended as any future Polish state within a German-dominated Europe. According to the Nazi government the Polish state had effectively ceased to exist, in spite of the existence of a Polish government-in-exile. The General Government had the character of a type of colonial state. It was not a Polish puppet government, as there were no Polish representatives above the local administration.

The government seat of the General Government was located in Kraków (German: &quot;&quot;; ) rather than in Warsaw for security reasons. The official state language was German, although Polish continued in use by local government. Useful institutions of the old Polish state were retained for ease of administration. The Polish police, with no high-ranking Polish officers (they were arrested or demoted), was reorganised as the Blue Police and became subordinated to the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;. The Polish educational system was similarly retained, but most higher institutions were closed. The Polish local administration was kept, subordinated to new German bosses. The Polish fiscal system, including the zloty currency, remained in use but with revenues going to the German state. A new bank was created; it issued new banknotes.

The Germans sought to play Ukrainians and Poles off against each other. Within ethnic Ukrainian areas annexed by Germany, beginning in October 1939, Ukrainian Committees were established with the purpose of representing the Ukrainian community to the German authorities and assisting the approximately 30,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled from Soviet-controlled territories. These committees also undertook cultural and economic activities that had been banned by the previous Polish government. Schools, choirs, reading societies and theaters were opened, and twenty Ukrainian churches that had been closed by the Polish government reopened. By March 1941, there were 808 Ukrainian educational societies with 46,000 members.

A Ukrainian publishing house and periodical press was set up in Cracow, which – despite having to struggle with German censors and paper shortages – succeeded in publishing school textbooks, classics of Ukrainian literature, and the works of dissident Ukrainian writers from the Soviet Union. &quot;Krakivs&#x27;ki Visti&quot; was headed by Frank until the end of World War II and had as editor Michael Chomiak. It was &quot;the leading legal newspaper&quot; of the General Government and &quot;attracted more (and better) contributors among whom were the most prominent Ukrainian cultural figures of the (early) 20th century.&quot;

Ukrainian organizations within the General Government were able to negotiate the release of 85,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war from the German-Polish conflict (although they were unable to help Soviet POWs of Ukrainian ethnicity).

After the war, the Polish Supreme National Tribunal declared that the government of the General Government was a criminal institution.

===Judicial system===
Other than summary German military tribunals, no courts operated in Poland between the German invasion and early 1940. At that time, the Polish court system was reinstated and made decisions in cases not concerning German interests, for which a parallel German court-system was established. The German system was given priority in cases of overlapping jurisdiction.

New laws were passed, discriminating against ethnic Poles and, in particular, the Jews. In 1941 a new criminal law was introduced, introducing many new crimes, and making the death penalty very common. The death penalty was introduced for, among other things:
*on October 31, 1939, for any acts against the German government
*on January 21, 1940, for economic speculation
*on February 20, 1940, for spreading sexually-transmitted diseases
*on July 31, 1940, for any Polish officers who did not register immediately with the German administration (to be taken to prisoner of war camps)
*on November 10, 1941, for giving any assistance to Jews
*on July 11, 1942, for farmers who failed to provide requested crops
*on July 24, 1943, for not joining the forced labor battalions (Baudienst) when requested
*on October 2, 1943, for impeding the German Reconstruction Plan

===Policing===
The police in the General Government was divided into:

*&quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (OrPo) (native German)
*the Blue Police (Polish under German control)
*&quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (native German) composed of:
**&quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; (German)
**Gestapo (German)

The most numerous OrPo battalions focused on traditional security roles as an occupying force. Some of them were directly involved in the pacification operations. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, this latter role was obscured both by the lack of court evidence and by deliberate obfuscation, while most of the focus was on the better-known &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; (&quot;Operational groups&quot;) who reported to RSHA led by Reinhard Heydrich. On 6 May 1940 &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Hans Frank, stationed in occupied Kraków, established the &quot;Sonderdienst&quot;, based on similar &quot;SS&quot; formations called &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; operating in the &quot;Warthegau&quot; district of German-annexed western part of Poland since 1939. &quot;Sonderdienst&quot; were made up of ethnic German &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; who lived in Poland before the attack and joined the invading force thereafter. However, after the 1941 Operation Barbarossa they included also the Soviet prisoners of war who volunteered for special training, such as the &quot;Trawniki men&quot; (German: &quot;Trawnikimänner&quot;) deployed at all major killing sites of the &quot;Final Solution&quot;. A lot of those men did not know German and required translation by their native commanders. Ukrainian Auxiliary Police was formed in Distrikt Galizien in 1941, many policemen deserted in 1943 joining UPA.

The former Polish policemen, with no high-ranking Polish officers (who were arrested or demoted), were drafted to the Blue Police and became subordinated to the local Ordnungspolizei.

Some 3,000 men served with the &quot;Sonderdienst&quot; in the General Government, formally assigned to the head of the civil administration. The existence of &quot;Sonderdienst&quot; constituted a grave danger for the non-Jewish Poles who attempted to help ghettoised Jews in the cities, as in the Mińsk Mazowiecki Ghetto among numerous others, because Christian Poles were executed under the charge of aiding Jews.

A Forest Protection Service also existed, responsible for policing wooded areas in the General Government.

A Bahnpolizei policed railroads.

The Germans used pre-war Polish prisons and organised new ones, like in Jan Chrystian Schuch Avenue police quarter in Warsaw and Under the Clock torture centre in Lublin.

German administration constructed a terror system to control Polish people enforcing reports of any illegal activities, e.g. hiding Roma, POWs, guerilla fighters, Jews. Germans designated hostages, terrorised local leaders, applied collective responsibility. German police used sting operations to find and kill rescuers of the Germans&#x27; quarries.

===Military occupation forces===
Through the occupation Germany diverted a significant number of its military forces to keep control over Polish territories.
===Nazi propaganda===
The propaganda was directed by the &quot;Fachabteilung für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda&quot; (FAVuP), since Spring 1941 &quot;Hauptabteilung Propaganda&quot; (HAP). Prasą kierował &quot;Dienststelle der Pressechef der Regierung des Generalgouvernements&quot;, a w Berlinie &quot;Der Bevollmächtige des Generalgouverneurs in Berlin&quot;.

====Anti-semitic propaganda====

Thousands of anti-Semitic posters were distributed in Warsaw.

====Political propaganda====

Germans wanted Poles to obey orders.

====Polish language newspapers====
*&quot;Nowy Kurier Warszawski&quot;
*&quot;Kurier Częstochowski&quot;
*&quot;Goniec Krakowski&quot;
*&quot;Dziennik Radomski&quot;
*&quot;Goniec Codzienny&quot;
*&quot;Ilustrowany Kurier Polski&quot;
*&quot;Gazeta Lwowska&quot;
*&quot;Fala&quot;

====Cinemas====
Propaganda newsreels of &quot;Die Deutsche Wochenschau&quot; (The German Weekly Review) preceded feature-film showings. Some feature films likewise contained Nazi propaganda. The Polish underground discouraged Poles from attending movies, advising them, in the words of the rhymed couplet, &quot;Tylko świnie / siedzą w kinie&quot; (&quot;Only swine go to the movies&quot;).

In occupied Poland, there was no Polish film industry. However, a few Poles collaborated with the Germans in making films such as the 1941 anti-Polish propaganda film &quot;Heimkehr&quot; (&quot;Homecoming&quot;). In that film, casting for minor parts played by Jewish and Polish actors was done by Igo Sym, who during the filming was shot in his Warsaw apartment by the Polish Union of Armed Struggle resistance movement; after the war, the Polish performers were sentenced for collaboration in an anti-Polish propaganda undertaking, with punishments ranging from official reprimand to imprisonment.

====Theaters====
All Polish theaters were disbanded. A German theater &quot;Theater der Stadt Warschau&quot; was formed in Warsaw together with a German controlled Polish one &quot;Teatr Miasta Warszawy&quot;. There existed also one comedy theater &quot;Teatr Komedia&quot; and 14 small ones. The Juliusz Słowacki Theatre in Cracow was used by Germans.

====Audio propaganda====
Poles were not allowed to use radio sets. Any set was to be handed over to local administration by 25 January 1940. Ethnic Germans were obliged to register their sets.

German authorities installed megaphones for propaganda purposes, called by Poles &quot;szczekaczki&quot; (from pol. &quot;szczekać&quot; &quot;to bark&quot;).

===Public executions===

Germans killed thousands of Poles, many of them civilian hostages, in Warsaw streets and locations around Warsaw (Warsaw ring), to terrorize the populationthey shot or hanged them. The executions were ordered mainly by Austrian Nazi Franz Kutschera, &quot;SS&quot; and Police Leader, from September 1943 until January 1944.

===Urban planning and transportation network===
Warsaw was to be reconstructed according to Pabst Plan. The governmental quarter was situated around the Piłsudski Square.

The capital of GG Kraków was reconstructed according to &quot;Generalbebauungsplan von Krakau&quot; by Hubert Ritter. Hans Frank rebuild his residence Wawel Castle. &lt; Dębniki (Kraków) was the planned Nazi administrative quarter. German-only residential area was constructed near Park Krakowski.

Germans constructed railroad line Łódź-Radom (partially in GG) and engine house in Radom.

==Administrative districts==

For administrative purposes the General Government was subdivided into four districts (&quot;Distrikte&quot;). These were the &quot;Distrikt Warschau&quot;, the &quot;Distrikt Lublin&quot;, the &quot;Distrikt Radom&quot;, and the &quot;Distrikt Krakau&quot;. After the Operation Barbarossa against the Soviets in June 1941, East Galicia (part of Poland, annexed by the Ukrainian SSR on the basis of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact), was incorporated into the General Government and became its fifth district: &quot;Distrikt Galizien&quot;. The new German administrative units were much larger than those organized by the Polish government, reflecting the German lack of sufficient administrative personnel to staff smaller units.

The five districts were further sub-divided into urban counties (&quot;Stadtkreise&quot;) and rural counties (&quot;Kreishauptmannschaften&quot;). Following a decree on September 15, 1941, the names of most of the major cities (and their respective counties) were renamed based on historical German data or given germanified versions of their Polish and Soviet names if none existed. At times the previous names remained the same as well (i.e. Radom). The districts and counties were as follows:

A change in the administrative structure was desired by Finance Minister Lutz von Krosigk, who for financial reasons wanted to see the five existing districts (Warsaw, Kraków, Radom, Lublin, and Galicia) reduced to three. In March 1943 he announced the merger of the Kraków and Galicia districts, and the split of the Warsaw district between the Radom district and the Lublin district. (The latter acquired a special status of &quot;Germandom district&quot;, &quot;Deutschtumsdistrikt&quot;, as a &quot;test run&quot; of the Germanization according to the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;.) The restructuring further involved the changing of Warsaw and Kraków into separate city-districts (&quot;Stadtdistrikte&quot;), with Warsaw under the direct control of the General Government. This decree was to go into effect on 1 April 1943 and was nominally accepted by Heinrich Himmler, but Martin Bormann opposed the move, as he simply wanted to see the region turned into &quot;Reichsgaue&quot; (Germany proper). Wilhelm Frick and Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger were also skeptic about the usefulness of this reorganization, resulting in its abolition after subsequent discussions between Himmler and Frank.

==Demographics==
The General Government was inhabited by 11.4 million people in December 1939. A year later the population increased to 12.1 million. In December 1940, 83.3% of the population were Poles, 11.2% Jews, 4.4% Ukrainians and Belarusians, 0.9% Germans, and 0.2% others. About 860,000 Poles and Jews were resettled into the General Government after they were expelled from the territories &#x27;annexed&#x27; by Nazi Germany. Offsetting this was the German genocidal campaign of liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia and other elements considered likely to resist. From 1941 disease and hunger also began to reduce the population.

Poles were also deported in large numbers to work as forced labor in Germany: eventually about a million were deported, of whom many died in Germany. In 1940 the population was segregated into different groups. Each group had different rights, food rations, allowed strips in the cities, public transportation and restricted restaurants. They were divided from the most privileged, to the least.

#Germans from Germany (&quot;Reichdeutsche&quot;),
#Germans from outside, active ethnic Germans, Volksliste category 1 and 2 (see Volksdeutsche).
#Germans from outside, passive Germans and members of families (this group also included some ethnic Poles), Volksliste category 3 and 4,
#Ukrainians,
#Highlanders (&quot;Goralenvolk&quot;) – an attempt to split the Polish nation by using local collaborators
#Poles (partially exterminated),
#Romani people (eventually largely exterminated as a category),
#Jews (eventually largely exterminated as a category).

==Economics==
After the invasion of Poland in 1939, Jews over the age of 12 and Poles over the age of 14 living in the General Government were subject to forced labor. Many Poles from other regions of Poland conquered by Germany were expelled to the General Government and the area was used as a slave labour pool from which men and women taken by force to work as laborers in factories and farms in Germany. In 1942, all non-Germans living in the General Government were subject to forced labor.

Parts of Warsaw and several towns (Wieluń, Sulejów, Frampol) were destroyed during the Polish-German war in September 1939. Poles weren&#x27;t able to buy any construction materials to reconstruct their houses or businesses. They lost their savings and GG currency, nicknamed &quot;Młynarki&quot;, was managed by German-controlled Bank Emisyjny w Polsce.
Former Polish state property was confiscated by the General Government (or by Nazi Germany in the annexed territories). Notable property of Polish individuals (ex. factories and large land estates) was often confiscated as well and managed by German &quot;trusts&quot; (). Jewish population was deported to the Ghettos, their dwelling and businesses were confiscated by the Germans, small businesses were sometimes passed to the Poles.
Farmers were required to provide large food contingents for the Germans, and there were plans for nationalization of all but the smallest estates.

German administration implemented a system of exploitation of Jewish and Polish people, which included high taxes.

== Food supply ==
While scholars debate whether from September 1939 to June 1941 the mass-starvation of the Jewish people of Europe was an attempt to conduct mass murder, it is agreed upon that this starvation did kill a large amount of this population. There was a shift in the amount of resources that were being used by the Generalgouvernement from 1939 to 1940. For example, in 1939, seven million tons of coal were used but in 1940 this was reduced to four million tons of coal used by the Generalgouvernement. This shift was emblematic of the shortages in supplies, depriving the Jews and Poles of their only heating source. Although before the war, Poland exported mass quantities of food, in 1940 the Generalgouvernement was unable to supply enough food for the country, nonetheless exporting food supplies. In December 1939, the Polish and Jewish reception committees, as well as the native local officials, all within the Generalgouvernement, were responsible for providing food and shelter to the Poles and Jews that evacuated. In the expulsion process, the help provided to the evacuated Poles and Jews by the Generalgouvernement was considered a weak branch of the overall process. Throughout 1939, the Reichsbahn was responsible for many of the other important tasks including the deportations of Poles and Jews to concentration camps as well as the delivery of food and raw materials to different places. In December 1940, 87,833 Poles and Jews were deported which added stress to different administrations which were now responsible for these deportees. During the deportations, people were forced to reside on the trains for days until a place was found for them to stay. Between the cold and lack of food, masses of deportees died due to transport deaths caused by malnutrition, cold, and moreover unlivable transportation conditions.

The prices for food outside of ghettos and concentration camps had to be set at a reasonable price in order for them to align with the black market; setting prices at a reasonable rate would ensure that farmers did not sell their crops illegally. If the prices were set too high in cities there was a concern that workers would not be able to afford the food and protest the prices. Due to the price inflation which was occurring in the Generalgouvernement, many places relied on the barter system (exchanging goods for other goods instead of money). &quot;Introducing rationing in September 1940, Marshal Petain insisted that ‘everyone must assume their share of common hardship.’&quot; There was clearly food instability not only in the ghettos, but also in cities, which caused everyone to be conscious about food rationing, and caused conditions for Jewish people to worsen. While workers in Norway and France protested the new rationing of food, Germany and the UK, where the citizens supported war efforts were more supportive of the rationing therefore it was more effective. Cases, where a country was being occupied, caused the citizens to be more hesitant about the rationing of food and it was overall not as effective. In December, 1941 it was recognized by the Generalgouvernement that starving the Jewish people to death was an inexpensive and expedient solution. In August 1942, the required food shipments from the General Government to the Reich were increased and decided that the 1.2 million Jews that were not completing jobs that were &quot;important to Germany&quot; would no longer be given food. The Nazis knew the effects of depriving the Jewish people of food, yet it continued; the ultimate revolt against the Jewish race was mass murder due to starvation. The Food and Agriculture Ministry administered the rations of food in concentration camps. Each camp&#x27;s administration got food from the open market and depots of the Waffen-SS (Standartenführer Tschentscher). Once the food arrived at a camp, it was up to the administration how to distribute it. The diet for the Jews in these camps was &quot;watery turnip soup drunk from pots; it was supplemented by an evening meal of sawdust bread with some margarine, ‘smelly marmalade,’ or ‘putrid sausage.’ Between the two meals inmates attempted to lap a few drops of polluted water from the faucet in a wash barracks.&quot;

=== Black market ===
During this environment of food scarcity Jews turned to the black market for any source of sustenance. The black market was important both in and outside of the ghettos from 1940 to 1944. Outside of the ghettos, the black market existed because rations were not high enough for the citizens to remain healthy. In the ghettos of eastern Europe in August 1941 the Jewish population recognized that if they were forced to remain in these ghettos they would eventually die of hunger. Many people that were in ghettos made trades with the outside world in order to stay alive. Jewish people were forced to reside in ghettos, where the economy was isolated and there were large food shortages, which caused them to be seen as a source for cheap labor; many were given food that was purchased on the Aryan side of the wall in exchange for their labor. The isolation of the people forced into ghettos caused there to be a disconnect between the buyer and seller, which added in another player: the black market middleman. The black market middleman would make a profit by creating connections between sellers and buyers. While supply and demand was inelastic in these ghettos, the selling of this food on the blackmarket was extremely competitive, and beyond the reach of most Jews in ghettos.

==Resistance==
Resistance to the German occupation began almost at once, although there is little terrain in Poland suitable for guerrilla operations. Several small army troops supported by volunteers fought till Spring 1940, e.g. under major Henryk Dobrzański, after which they ceased due to German executions of civilians as reprisals.
The main resistance force was the Home Army (in Polish: &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; or &quot;AK&quot;), loyal to the Polish government in exile in London. It was formed mainly of the surviving remnants of the pre-War Polish Army, together with many volunteers. Other forces existed side-by-side, such as the communist People&#x27;s Army &quot;(Armia Ludowa&quot; or AL) parallel to the PPR, organized and controlled by the Soviet Union. The AK was estimated between 200,000 and 600,000 men, while the AL was estimated between 14,000 and 60,000.

German repressions in 1942-43 caused the Zamość uprising.
In April 1943 the Germans began deporting the remaining Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto, provoking the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, April 19 to May. 16 That was the first armed uprising against the Germans in Poland, and prefigured the larger and longer Warsaw Uprising of 1944.

In July 1944, as the Soviet armed forces approached Warsaw, the government in exile called for an uprising in the city, so that they could return to a liberated Warsaw and try to prevent a Communist take-over. The AK, led by Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski, launched the Warsaw Rising on August 1 in response both to their government and to Soviet and Allied promises of help. However Soviet help was never forthcoming, despite the Soviet army being only 18 miles (30 km) away, and Soviet denial of their airbases to British and American planes prevented any effective resupply or air support of the insurgents by the Western allies. They used distant Italian bases in their Warsaw airlift instead. After 63 days of fighting the leaders of the rising agreed a conditional surrender with the Wehrmacht. The 15,000 remaining Home Army soldiers were granted POW status (prior to the agreement, captured rebels were shot), and the remaining civilian population of 180,000 expelled.

==Education==
All universities in GG were disbanded, many Kraków professors imprisoned during the &quot;Sonderaktion Krakau&quot;.

==Culture of Poland==

Germans plundered Polish museums. Many of the pieces of art perished. Germans burned a number of Warsaw libraries, including the National Library of Poland, destroying about 3.6 million volumes.

== German sport ==
Hans Frank was an avid chess player, so he organized General Government chess tournaments. Only Germans were allowed to perform in sporting events. About 80 football clubs played in four district divisions.

==The Holocaust==

During the Wannsee conference on January 20, 1942, the State Secretary of the General Government, &quot;SS-Brigadeführer&quot; Josef Bühler encouraged Heydrich to implement the &quot;Final Solution&quot;. From his own point of view, as an administrative official, the problems in his district included an overdeveloped black market. He endorsed a remedy in solving the &quot;Jewish question&quot; as fast as possible. An additional point in favor of setting up the extermination facilities in his governorate was that there were no transportation problems there, since all assets of the disbanded Polish State Railways (PKP) were being managed by &quot;Ostbahn&quot;, the Kraków-based &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; branch of the &quot;Generaldirektion der Ostbahn&quot; (&quot;General Directorate of Eastern Railways&quot;, Gedob). This made a network of death trains readily available to the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot;.
The newly drafted Operation Reinhard would be a major step in the systematic liquidation of the Jews in occupied Europe, beginning with those in the General Government. Within months, three top-secret camps were built and equipped with stationary gas chambers disguised as shower rooms, based on Action T4, solely to efficiently kill thousands of people each day. The Germans began the elimination of the Jewish population under the guise of &quot;resettlement&quot; in spring of 1942. The three Reinhard camps including Treblinka (the deadliest of them all) had transferable SS staff and almost identical design. The General Government was the location of four of the seven extermination camps of World War II in which the most extreme measures of the Holocaust were carried out, including closely located Majdanek concentration camp, Sobibor extermination camp and Belzec extermination camp. The genocide of undesired &quot;races&quot;, chiefly millions of Jews from Poland and other countries, was carried out by gassing between 1942 and 1944.

== Punishments ==
*Hans Frank instituted a reign of terror against the civilian population and became directly involved in the mass murder of Jews. At the Nuremberg trials, he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity and was executed. His secretaries, Arthur Seyss-Inquart and Josef Bühler, were executed in Nuremberg and Poland, respectively.
*Ludwig Fischer was a governor of the Warsaw District. He was sentenced and hanged in Warsaw.
*Ernst Kundt was a governor of the Radom District. He was sentenced and hanged in Czechoslovakia.

==Notes==

:a. The RKF (also RKFDV) stands for the &quot;Reichskommissar für die Festigung des deutschen Volkstums&quot;, or the Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood, an office in Nazi Germany held by &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler. Meanwhile, the HTO stands for &quot;Haupttreuhandstelle Ost&quot;, or the Main Trustee Office for the East, a Nazi German predatory institution responsible for liquidating Polish and Jewish businesses across occupied Poland; and selling them off for profit mainly to the SS, or the German &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; and war-profiteers if interested. The HTO was created and headed by Nazi potentate &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring.

<text>The Heidelberg School was an Australian art movement of the late 19th century. It has been described as Australian impressionism.

Melbourne art critic Sidney Dickinson coined the term in an 1891 review of works by Arthur Streeton and Walter Withers, two local artists who painted &quot;en plein air&quot; in Heidelberg on the city&#x27;s rural outskirts. The term has since evolved to cover these and other painters—most notably Tom Roberts, Charles Conder and Frederick McCubbin—who worked together at &quot;artists&#x27; camps&quot; around Melbourne and Sydney in the 1880s and 1890s. Drawing on naturalist and impressionist ideas, they sought to capture Australian life, the bush, and the harsh sunlight that typifies the country.

The movement emerged at a time of strong nationalist sentiment in the Australian colonies, then on the cusp of federating. The artists&#x27; paintings, like the bush poems of the contemporaneous Bulletin School, were celebrated for being distinctly Australian in character, and by the early 20th century, critics had come to identify the movement as the beginning of an Australian tradition in Western art. Many of their major works can be seen in Australia&#x27;s public galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

==History==
The name refers to the then-rural area of Heidelberg, east of Melbourne, where practitioners of the style found their subject matter, though usage expanded to cover other Australian artists working in similar areas. The core group painted together at &quot;artists&#x27; camps&quot;, the first being the Box Hill artists&#x27; camp, established in 1885 by Tom Roberts, Frederick McCubbin and Louis Abrahams. They were later joined by Arthur Streeton, Walter Withers, and Charles Conder. See below for a list of other associated artists.

===9 by 5 Impression Exhibition===
In August 1889, several artists of the Heidelberg School staged their first independent exhibition at Buxton&#x27;s Rooms, Swanston Street, opposite the Melbourne Town Hall. Named the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition, it included 183 &quot;impressions&quot;, of which 63 were by Tom Roberts, 40 by Arthur Streeton and 46 by Charles Conder. Smaller contributions came from Frederick McCubbin and Charles Douglas Richardson, who, in addition to 19 oil paintings, included five &quot;sculpted impressions&quot; in wax and bronze. The majority of the works date from the autumn and winter of 1889 and were painted on wooden cigar-box lids, most measuring 9 by 5 inches (23 × 13 cm), hence the name of the exhibition. Louis Abrahams, a member of the Box Hill artists&#x27; camp, sourced the lids from his cigar business, Sniders &amp; Abrahams.

In order to emphasise the small size of the paintings, the artists displayed them in broad kauri pine frames, many asymmetrical in design and left unornamented, others painted in metallic colours or decorated with verse and small sketches, giving the works an &quot;unconventional, avant garde look&quot;. The Japonist décor they chose for Buxton&#x27;s Rooms featured Japanese screens, silk draperies, umbrellas, and vases with flowers that perfumed the gallery, while background music was performed on certain afternoons. The harmony and &quot;total effect&quot; of the display showed the marked influence of Whistler and the broader aesthetic movement. 
The artists generated publicity for the exhibition through a series of calculated press interviews and articles. Intentionally provocative, they sought to challenge artistic norms and give Melbourne society &quot;an opportunity of judging for itself what Impressionism truly is&quot;. They wrote in the catalogue:

The exhibition caused a stir during its three-week run with Melbourne society &quot;[flocking] to Buxton’s, hoping to be amazed, intrigued or outraged&quot;. The general public, though somewhat bemused, responded positively, and within two weeks of the opening, most of the 9 by 5s had sold. The response from critics, however, was mixed. The most scathing review came from James Smith, then Australia&#x27;s foremost art critic, who said the 9 by 5s were &quot;destitute of all sense of the beautiful&quot; and &quot;whatever influence [the exhibition] was likely to exercise could scarcely be otherwise than misleading and pernicious.&quot; The artists nailed the review to the entrance of the venue—attracting many more passing pedestrians to, in Streeton&#x27;s words, &quot;see the dreadful paintings&quot;—and responded with a letter to the Editor of Smith&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Argus&quot;. Described as a manifesto, the letter defends freedom of choice in subject and technique, concluding:

The 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition is now regarded as a landmark event in Australian art history. Approximately one-third of the 9 by 5s are known to have survived, many of which are held in Australia&#x27;s public collections, and have sold at auction for prices exceeding $1,000,000.

===Grosvenor Chambers===

In April 1888, Grosvenor Chambers, Melbourne&#x27;s first custom-built complex of artists&#x27; studios, opened at the eastern end of Collins Street. It was built by the art decorating firm Paterson Bros., established by Hugh and James Paterson, brothers of &quot;plein airist&quot; and associate of the Heidelberg School John Ford Paterson. The architects arranged the lighting and interior design of the building after consulting Roberts, who, along with Heidelberg School members Jane Sutherland and Clara Southern, was among the first artists to occupy studios in the building. Grosvenor Chambers quickly became the focal point of Melbourne&#x27;s art scene, with Conder, Streeton, McCubbin, Louis Abrahams and John Mather also moving in.

The presence of Roberts, Streeton and Conder at Grosvenor Chambers accounts for the high number of urban views they included in the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition, including Roberts&#x27; &quot;By the Treasury&quot;, painted from the vantage point of his studio and featuring the Old Treasury Building on Spring Street.

Grosvenor Chambers was used an urban base from which members of the Heidelberg School could receive sitters for portraits. It is evident from these portraits that many of the artists decorated their studios in an Aesthetic manner, showing the influence of James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Roberts&#x27; use of eucalypts and golden wattle as decorations started a fad for Australian flora in the home. He also initiated in-studio &quot;&quot; at which artists discussed recent artistic trends and read the latest art journals.

Inspired by the success of Grosvenor Chambers, another complex of studios, Gordon Chambers, opened on Flinders Lane in 1889. Streeton, Conder and Richardson soon moved in, and in 1890, the trio staged a show of Heidelberg landscapes there in the lead up to the Victorian Artists&#x27; Society&#x27;s Winter exhibition. During this period, members of the Heidelberg School began hosting simultaneous exhibitions across Grosvenor Chambers, Gordon Chambers and other nearby studios, with visitors and prospective buyers being invited to move freely between them.

===Sydney===
Roberts first visited Sydney in 1887. There, he developed a strong artistic friendship with Charles Conder, a young painter who had already gone on &quot;plein air&quot; excursions outside Sydney and picked up some impressionist techniques from expatriate artist G. P. Nerli. In early 1888, before Conder joined Roberts on his return trip to Melbourne, the pair painted companion works at the beachside suburb of Coogee.

When a severe economic depression hit Melbourne in 1890, Roberts and Streeton moved to Sydney, first setting up camp at Mosman Bay, a small cove of the harbour, before finally settling around the corner at Curlew Camp, which was accessible by the Mosman ferry. Melbourne artist Albert Henry Fullwood stayed with Streeton at Curlew, as well as other &quot;plen air&quot; painters on occasion, including prominent art teacher and Heidelberg School supporter Julian Ashton, who resided nearby at the Balmoral artists&#x27; camp. Ashton had earlier introduced Conder to &quot;plein air&quot; painting, and in 1890, as a trustee of the National Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney, secured the acquisition of Streeton&#x27;s Heidelberg landscape ‘&quot;Still glides the stream, and shall forever glide&quot;’ (1890)—the first of the artist&#x27;s works to enter a public collection. The more sympathetic patronage shown by Ashton and others in Sydney inspired more artists to make the move from Melbourne.

Streeton won acclaim in Sydney for his harbour views, many of which were collected by Eadith Walker and Howard Hinton, two of the city&#x27;s leading art patrons. In a poem dedicated to the artist, composer and outspoken sensualist George Marshall-Hall declared Streeton&#x27;s Sydney the &quot;City of laughing loveliness! Sun-girdled Queen!&quot;, which became the title of one of his harbour views. The National Gallery of Victoria notes:
From Sydney, Streeton, Roberts and Fullwood branched out into country New South Wales, where, in the early 1890s, they painted some of their most celebrated works.

===Second phase===

By the early 1890s, the golden era of the Heidelberg School had come to an end as several leading members pursued more individual paths. Conder moved to Europe, where he became a legendary figure of the &quot;fin de siècle&quot;, mixing within the social circles of Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley, and frequenting Parisian bohemian districts with the likes of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Streeton continued to work primarily in and around Sydney until 1897, when he too moved to Europe, settling in London. Roberts followed a few years later. The artists maintained correspondence and, when recalling the Heidelberg School period, often did so with intense feelings of nostalgia. Conder wrote to Roberts:
Back in Melbourne, McCubbin, Withers, Paterson, Sutherland, Leon Pole and Tom Humphrey continued to work &quot;en plein air&quot; in and around Heidelberg. From 1890, Charterisville, a rural property in neighbouring East Ivanhoe, became the favoured hub of many of these artists. They were soon joined by younger Australians such as David Davies and E. Phillips Fox, who, during their studies in France, had picked up impressionist techniques and visited artists&#x27; colonies. Throughout the 1890s, Fox and Tudor St. George Tucker ran the Melbourne School of Art at Charterisville, teaching &quot;plein airism&quot; and impressionist techniques to a new generation of artists, including Ina Gregory, Violet Teague and Hugh Ramsay.

==Influences and style==

Like many of their contemporaries in Europe and North America, the Heidelberg School artists adopted a direct and impressionistic style of painting. They were committed &quot;plein airists&quot; who sought to depict daily life, showed a keen interest in transient light and its effect on colour, and experimented with loose brushwork. Art critics such as Robert Hughes have noted that their &quot;impressionism&quot; was closer to Whistler&#x27;s tonal impressionism than the broken colours of the French impressionists. Indeed, the Heidelberg School artists did not espouse any colour theory, and, like another main influence of theirs, Jules Bastien-Lepage, often maintained a realist sense of form, clarity and composition. They also sometimes created works within the narrative conventions of both Victorian and history painting, and made occasional use of symbolist imagery. Much of what they knew of French impressionism was through correspondence with painter John Russell, an Australian expatriate in France who befriended, and painted alongside the likes of Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet. Encouraged by Russell, John Longstaff, a peripheral figure of the Heidelberg School, temporarily adopted French impressionist methods. Streeton however opined that they were overly technical &quot;ways and means&quot; that interrupted the spontaneous act of painting. Conder, when in France in the early 1890s, admired Monet&#x27;s work but considered French impressionism on the whole &quot;ultra [extremist]&quot;. It was not until 1907 that McCubbin saw their works in person, which encouraged his evolution towards brighter colours and a more abstracted style.
The Heidelberg School painters were not merely following an international trend, but &quot;were interested in making paintings that looked distinctly Australian&quot;. They greatly admired the light-infused landscapes of Louis Buvelot, a Swiss-born artist and art teacher who, in the 1860s, adapted French Barbizon School principles to the countryside around Melbourne. Regarding Buvelot as &quot;the father of Australian landscape painting&quot;, they showed little interest in the works of earlier colonial artists, which they likened to European scenes that did not reflect Australia&#x27;s harsh sunlight, earthier colours and distinctive vegetation. The Heidelberg School painters spoke of seeing Australia &quot;through Australian eyes&quot;, and by 1889, Roberts argued that they had successfully developed &quot;a distinct and vital and creditable style&quot;. Likewise Streeton, when told in 1896 that his paintings were French in style, claimed that his work &quot;is purely and absolutely Australian, not only as regards colour, but in idea and expression&quot;.

Beyond the visual arts, the Heidelberg School also took inspiration from Australian literature. They responded strongly to poet Adam Lindsay Gordon&#x27;s emotional, sensorial evocations of the Australian landscape, both illustrating his work directly and using it as the basis for the titles of other paintings. Owing to shared themes and nationalist sentiments, the Heidelberg School is often described as painting&#x27;s counterpart to the contemporaneous Bulletin School of bush poetry, centered around the journal &quot;The Bulletin&quot; and numbering Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson among its members.

==Associated artists==
The Heidelberg School had no official membership, but artists are said to be part of the movement based on their adoption of &quot;plein airism&quot; and impressionist techniques, as well as their attendance at Melbourne and Sydney&#x27;s &quot;artists&#x27; camps&quot;. Many trained together at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School and were active members of both the bohemian artists&#x27; society the Buonarotti Club and the Victorian Artists&#x27; Society, where they staged group exhibitions.

==Legacy==

In his seminal work &quot;The Story of Australian Art&quot; (1934), art historian William Moore referred to the Heidelberg School as &quot;the golden age of landscape painting in Australia&quot;. By this time, Australia&#x27;s leading art institutions had fully embraced the movement&#x27;s style and pastoral vision, while simultaneously shunning the modernist innovations of more recent Australian artists, such as Clarice Beckett, Roy De Maistre and Grace Cossington Smith. Even until the early 1940s, winning entries of the prestigious Wynne Prize, awarded annually by the Art Gallery of New South Wales for &quot;the best landscape painting of Australian scenery&quot;, &quot;invariably depicted the gum trees, sunlight and rural scene as developed by Streeton and Roberts&quot;. Heidelberg School member Walter Withers won the inaugural Wynne Prize in 1897 with &quot;&quot;, and leading successors of the movement, Elioth Gruner and Hans Heysen, went on to win a record seven and nine times, respectively. According to Robert Hughes, the Heidelberg School tradition &quot;ossified&quot; during this period into a rigid academic system and an unimaginative national style prolonged by what he called its &quot;zombie acolytes&quot;. The federation of Australia in 1901, followed by World War I and the Great Depression, are seen to have contributed to the enduring popularity of their work. In the 1920s and 30s in particular, it offered comfort to Australians still reeling from the war, as it depicted a &quot;pastoral utopia&quot; that was &quot;eminently worth defending even unto death&quot;.

Writing in 1980, Australian artist and scholar Ian Burn described the Heidelberg School as &quot;mediating the relation to the bush of most people growing up in Australia. ... Perhaps no other local imagery is so much a part of an Australian consciousness and ideological make-up.&quot; Their works are known to many Australians through reproductions, adorning stamps, the walls of bars and motels, and the covers of paperback copies of colonial literature. Heidelberg School artworks are among the most collectible in Australian art; in 1995, the National Gallery of Australia acquired Streeton&#x27;s &quot;Golden Summer, Eaglemont&quot; (1889) from a private owner for $3.5 million, then a record price for an Australian painting. McCubbin&#x27;s &quot;Bush Idyll&quot; (1893) briefly held the record price for a publicly auctioned Australian painting when it sold at Christie&#x27;s in 1998 for $2.31 million.

The movement featured in the Australian citizenship test, overseen by former prime minister John Howard in 2007. Such references to history were removed the following year, instead focusing on &quot;the commitments in the pledge rather than being a general knowledge quiz about Australia.&quot;

===Influence on Australian cinema===
Many period films of the Australian New Wave drew upon the visual style and subject matter of the Heidelberg School. For &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (1975), director Peter Weir studied the Heidelberg School as a basis for art direction, lighting, and composition. &quot;Sunday Too Far Away&quot; (1975), set on an outback sheep station, pays homage to Roberts&#x27; shearing works, to the extent that &quot;Shearing the Rams&quot; is recreated within the film. When shooting the landscape in &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot; (1978), cinematographer Ian Baker tried to &quot;make every shot a Tom Roberts&quot;. &quot;The Getting of Wisdom&quot; (1977) and &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; (1979) each found inspiration in the Heidelberg School; outback scenes in the latter allude directly to works by Streeton, such as &quot;The Selector&#x27;s Hut&quot;. The movement is explored in &quot;One Summer Again&quot;, a three-part docudrama that first aired on ABC television in 1985. The series&#x27; depiction of the landscape was described by one critic as having &quot;the soft warmth of a McCubbin painting&quot;.

===Retrospective exhibitions===
The Heidelberg School has been surveyed in major exhibitions, including the nationwide blockbuster &quot;Golden Summers: Heidelberg and Beyond&quot; (1986), and &quot;Australian Impressionism&quot; (2007), held at the National Gallery of Victoria. Inspired by their acquisition of Streeton&#x27;s 1890 painting &quot;Blue Pacific&quot;, the National Gallery in London hosted an exhibition titled &quot;Australia&#x27;s Impressionists&quot; between December 2016 and March 2017, focusing on works by Streeton, Roberts, Conder and John Russell, an Australian impressionist based in Europe. In 2021, from April to August, the National Gallery of Victoria hosted the exhibition &quot;She-Oak and Sunlight: Australian Impressionism&quot;.

===Historiography and revisionist critiques===
The notion that the Heidelberg School painters were the first to objectively capture Australia&#x27;s &quot;scrubby bush&quot; gained widespread acceptance in the early 20th century, but has since been disputed; for example, in the 1960s art historian Bernard Smith identified &quot;an authentic bush atmosphere&quot; in John Lewin&#x27;s landscapes of the 1810s, and John Glover in the 1830s is seen to have faithfully rendered Australia&#x27;s unique light and sprawling, untidy gum trees. Another longstanding assumption has been that the Heidelberg School was groundbreaking in its choice of local themes and subjects, creating a nationalistic iconography centered on shearers, drovers, swagmen, and other rural figures. Such images had already become entrenched in Australian popular culture through the black-and-white art of &quot;The Bulletin&quot; and other illustrated periodicals. The pictorial tradition of the bushman can be traced back to S. T. Gill and other artists of the 1850s gold rushes, and reached its apotheosis with &quot;The Picturesque Atlas of Australasia&quot; (1886–88).

<text>Prodigy Communications Corporation was an online service from 1984 to 2001 that offered its subscribers access to a broad range of networked services. It was one of the major internet service providers of the 1990s.

The company claimed it was the first consumer online service, citing its graphical user interface and basic architecture as differentiation from CompuServe, which started in 1979 and used a command-line interface. Prodigy was described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;family-oriented&quot; and one of &quot;the Big Three information services&quot; in 1994. By 1990, it was the second-largest online service provider with 465,000 subscribers, trailing only CompuServe&#x27;s 600,000. In 1993 it was the largest.

In 2001, it was acquired by SBC Communications, which in 2005 became the present iteration of AT&amp;T. The Mexican branch of Prodigy, however, was acquired by Telmex.

==Early history==

The roots of Prodigy date to 1980 when broadcaster CBS and telecommunications firm AT&amp;T Corporation formed a joint venture named &quot;Venture One&quot; in Fair Lawn, New Jersey. The company conducted a market test of 100 homes in Ridgewood, New Jersey to gauge consumer interest in a Videotex-based TV set-top device that would allow consumers to shop at home and receive news, sports and weather. After concluding the market test, CBS and AT&amp;T took the data and went their separate ways in pursuit of developing and profiting from this market demand.

Prodigy was founded on February 13, 1984 as Trintex, a joint venture including CBS, computer manufacturer IBM and retailer Sears, Roebuck and Company. The company was headed by Theodore Papes, a career IBM executive, until his retirement in 1992. CBS left the venture in 1986 when CBS CEO Tom Wyman was divesting properties outside of CBS&#x27;s core broadcasting business. The company&#x27;s service was launched regionally in 1988 in Atlanta, Hartford and San Francisco under the name Prodigy. The marketing rollout plan closely followed IBM&#x27;s Systems Network Architecture (SNA) network backbone. A nationwide launch developed by ad agency J. Walter Thompson and sister company JWT Direct followed on September 6, 1990.

Subscribers using personal computers initially accessed the Prodigy service over copper wire telephone &quot;POTS&quot; service or X.25 dialup. Prodigy employed 1,200 bit/s modem connections for its initial rollout and offered low-cost 2,400 bit/s internal modems to subscribers at a discount to provide faster service and stabilize the diverse modem market. The host systems used were regionally distributed IBM Series/1 minicomputers managed by central IBM mainframes located in Yorktown Heights, New York.

Thanks to an aggressive media marketing campaign, bundling with various consumer-oriented computers such as IBM&#x27;s PS/1 and PS/2 as well as various clones and Hayes modems, the Prodigy service soon had more than one million subscribers. To handle the traffic, Prodigy built a national network of POP (points of presence) sites that made local access numbers available for most homes in the U.S. This significantly expanded the service because subscribers were not required to dial long distance to access the service. The subscribers paid only for the local call (usually free), while Prodigy paid for the connection to its national data center in Yorktown.

==Development==
Under the guidance of Henry Heilbrunn, Prodigy developed a fully staffed 24/7 newsroom with editors, writers and graphic artists intent on building the world&#x27;s first true online medium. The initial result was that Prodigy pioneered the concept of an online content portal—a single site offering news, weather, sports, communication with other members and shopping for goods and services such as groceries, general merchandise, brokerage services and airline reservations. The service provided several lifestyle features, including popular syndicated columnists, Zagat restaurant surveys, Consumer Reports articles and test reports, games for children and adults, in-depth original features called &quot;Timely Topics&quot;, bulletin boards moderated by subject matter experts, movie reviews and email. Working with Heilbrunn in the early stages of Prodigy&#x27;s design, Bob Bedard pioneered the business model for electronic commerce. Prodigy was the service that launched ESPN&#x27;s online presence.

Prodigy quickly implemented application standard code modules loaded from diskette. These modules relied upon real-time tokenized data from Prodigy database servers to drive core Prodigy service functionality on local user PCs. This client-server design worked well; by staging application-specific and reusable common code modules on Prodigy end-user diskettes, millisecond &quot;click-to-available-cursor&quot; response times were achieved that were otherwise unachievable in 1986 over slow 1,200-to-2,400 bit/s modems.

The service was presented using a graphical user interface. The Data Object Architecture wrapped vector and incremental point graphics, encoded as per NAPLPS, along with interpretative programs written in the proprietary languages TBOL (Trintex Basic Object Language) and PAL (Prodigy Application Language). NAPLPS grew out of the Canadian Telidon project, becoming an international standard in 1983 after some extensions were added by AT&amp;T Corporation. NAPLPS enabled the display of colors and graphics supporting electronic advertising, publishing and commerce. The initial emphasis was on DOS and later Microsoft Windows. After that, users could use the Apple Macintosh, but some Prodigy screens were not properly configured to the Mac standard, resulting in wasted space or partial graphics.

Prodigy&#x27;s initial business model relied more on advertising and online shopping for cash flow than on monthly subscriptions. Subscribers were charged a flat monthly fee that provided unlimited access. Initially, a monthly rate was set for unlimited usage time and 30 personal messages. In addition, subscribers could purchase additional messages. Later, Prodigy divided its service into &quot;Core&quot; and &quot;Plus&quot; sections. Core section usage remained unlimited, but Plus sections were limited by usage time. Subscribers were afforded a monthly allotment of Plus time, but if that time was exceeded, the subscriber would incur additional charges based on usage time. A blue indicator in the bottom-right corner of the screen indicated the subscriber&#x27;s section.
Prodigy&#x27;s shopping applications initially underperformed relative to expectations. This was attributed to the company&#x27;s misperception that online shoppers would pay a premium rather than expect discounts for merchandise and to the product&#x27;s poor graphics that resulted from the limitations of current technology. Using the early NAPLPS graphic standard, rendering realistic images of products was impossible, presenting great difficulty for online merchants to market products.

Despite these challenges, Prodigy was primarily responsible for helping merchants such as PC Flowers become some of the earliest e-commerce success stories. However, revenue from advertising was limited.

By 1993, Prodigy was developing a network architecture now known as a content delivery network in which the network caches its most frequently accessed content as close as possible to the users. The company sold private versions of it within customers&#x27; private corporate networks.

==Price increases==
Two of Prodigy&#x27;s most popular services were its message boards and email. Because Prodigy&#x27;s business model depended on rapidly growing advertising and online shopping revenue, email was initially developed primarily to aid shopping. However, it later found much greater usage as a means of general communication between users. The popularity of Prodigy&#x27;s message boards caused users to remain connected to the service far longer than had been projected. This resulted in escalating expenses that adversely affected the service&#x27;s cash flow and profitability.

To control costs and raise revenue, in January 1991, Prodigy modified its basic subscriber plans by allowing only 30 free email messages each month, while charging 25 cents for each additional email message, a policy that was later rescinded. In the summer of 1993, it began charging hourly rates for several of its most popular features, including its most popular feature, the message boards. This policy was later rescinded after tens of thousands of members left the service.

The price increases prompted an increase of &quot;underground IDs&quot; by which multiple users would share a single account and manipulate the email service to act as private bulletin boards. This was accomplished by sending emails to intentionally invalid addresses containing the name of the intended recipients. The service would return the emails, which were not billed, and users of the shared account would find the returned messages there. Replies were sent by entering the name of the first sender as the addressee, which would again trigger a return of the message.

Prodigy was slow to adopt features that made its rival AOL appealing, such as anonymous handles and real-time chat.

Eventually, the emergence of the Internet and the World Wide Web threatened to leave Prodigy behind.

==Conversion to a true ISP==
In 1994, Prodigy became the first of the early-generation dialup services to offer full access to the World Wide Web and to offer Web page hosting to its members. However, since Prodigy was not an actual Internet service provider, programs that needed an Internet connection, such as Internet Explorer and the &quot;Quake&quot; multiplayer game, could not be used with the service. Prodigy developed its own web browser, but it compared poorly to other mainstream browsers in terms of features.

In 1995/1996, Prodigy hired Ed Bennett and Will Lansing. From 1995 through 1996, Prodigy unveiled several Internet-related products. It debuted its real-time chat area within the service, similar to AOL&#x27;s. Access to Usenet newsgroups was made available and Prodigy&#x27;s first web presence, Astranet, was released shortly afterward. Astranet was to be a web-based news and information service supported partly by advertising. However, the site was considered experimental and incomplete. Another innovation was Skimmer, a market trial ISP service that became the base for Prodigy Internet.

In 1996, with Gregory C. Carr as chair, the company retooled itself as a true Internet service provider, making its main offering Internet access branded as Prodigy Internet. This new service featured personalized web content, news alerts to pagers, and Java chat. At the same time, Prodigy deemphasized its antiquated proprietary interface and editorial content, which were relabeled as Prodigy Classic. Prodigy Classic was discontinued on October 1, 1999 because the aging software was not Y2K compliant. The service had 209,000 members when it was discontinued.

==A public company==
In 1996, Prodigy was acquired by the former founders of Boston Technology and their new firm International Wireless, with Mexican businessman Carlos Slim Helú, a principal owner of Telmex, as a minority investor. IBM and Sears sold their interests to the group for $200 million. It was estimated that IBM and Sears had invested more than $1 billion in the service since its founding.

Prodigy continued to operate as it had previously, while Telmex provided Internet access under the Prodigy brand in Mexico and other parts of Latin America, with some services provided by Prodigy Communications in the US.

Prodigy went public in 1999, trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol PRGY. Later that year, Prodigy entered a strategic partnership with SBC Communications by which Prodigy would provide Internet services and SBC would provide exclusive sales opportunities and network, particularly DSL, facilities. The strategic partnership also gave SBC a 43% ownership interest in Prodigy.

On November 6, 2001, SBC purchased 100% interest in Prodigy and brought it private. On November 14, 2001, SBC and Yahoo! announced the strategic alliance to create the cobranded SBC Yahoo!. Sometime after that, SBC ceased offering new Prodigy accounts, and customers were encouraged to migrate to the SBC Yahoo! product line while maintaining their existing Prodigy email addresses.

==Headquarters==
Prodigy&#x27;s first headquarters was in White Plains Plaza in White Plains, New York. Prodigy announced plans to renew its lease in August 1992, occupying all of space in the building. In 1992, the facility had 1,000 employees.

In 2000, the company announced that it would move its headquarters to Austin, Texas in order to work more closely with SBC Communications. During that year, Prodigy leased of space in the River Place Pointe building in northwest Austin; the building, then under construction, was scheduled to be completed in 2001. Prodigy moved its headquarters in December 2000.

==Innovation==
Unlike many other competing services, Prodigy started with flat-rate pricing. When Prodigy moved to per-hour charging for its most popular services in June 1993, tens of thousands of users left the service.

Prodigy was also one of the first online services to offer a user-friendly GUI when competing services, such as CompuServe and GEnie, were still text-based. Prodigy used this graphical capability to deploy advertising, expecting it to result in a significant revenue stream.

Prodigy offered online banking, stock trading, advertising and online shopping before the World Wide Web became widely used, but was largely unable to capitalize on these first-mover advantages. Decades later, IBM, which now owns some of the original Prodigy patents, continues to sell licenses for basic ecommerce concepts.

Prodigy was a forerunner in caching data on and near users&#x27; personal computers to minimize networking and server expenses while improving the experience for users.

Prodigy&#x27;s legacy architecture was novel at the time and anticipated much of current web-browser technology. It leveraged the power of the subscriber&#x27;s PC to maintain the session state, handle the user interface and process applications formed from data and interpretative program objects largely pulled from the network when needed. At a time when distributed objects were handled by RPC equivalents, Prodigy pioneered the concept of returning interpretable, platform-independent objects to the caller for subsequent processing. This approach anticipated innovations such as Java applets and JavaScript. Prodigy also helped pioneer true distributed object-oriented client-server implementations as well as incidental innovations such as the equivalent of HTML frames and prefetching technology. Prodigy patented its inventions, which continue to be relevant and valuable.

==Growth==
By 1994, Prodigy became a pioneer in selling &quot;dial-up&quot; connections to the World Wide Web and sold hosting services for Web publishers.

Prodigy regularly became the focus of discussions on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in the mid-nineties. Numerous shows were devoted to it. In addition, Howard met face-to-face with people he had talked to in Prodigy chat groups under a pseudonym. Howard was the most prominent radio name in America, gaining excellent ratings at the time. So it could only have been a positive for the Prodigy brand.

As the company shifted from its focus on its exclusive &quot;Prodigy Classic&quot; content and started transitioning to &quot;Prodigy Internet&quot; as an ISP in the late 1990s, Prodigy found itself competing with many other lower-priced ISPs, and the price didn&#x27;t support the value of the Prodigy Internet exclusive content available for members. In a letter to members, Prodigy explained that upgrades to Prodigy Classic to resolve its Y2K issues were just too expensive and that it felt investing in Prodigy Internet was the best long-term strategy, as many of the popular services offered by Prodigy Classic could be found elsewhere. This decision was consistent with what other online service providers (AOL, CompuServe, MSN) were doing at the time. Still, with these providers competing primarily on ease of ISP setup rather than exclusive content, the retention value was lost. Many members found more affordable ways to access the online content and services they were used to.

In 1999 the company, now led by a cadre of ex-MCI executives to turn the brand around, became Prodigy Internet, marketing a full range of services, applications, and content, including dial-up and DSL for consumers and small businesses, instant messaging, e-mail, and communities.

== Acquisition ==
In 2000, with subscriber growth exploding and brand attributes at an all-time high, Prodigy explored several partnership deals, including what would have been an unprecedented three-way merger with Earthlink and Mindspring. Ultimately, SBC bought a 43% interest in the company, and Prodigy became the exclusive provider to SBC&#x27;s 77 million high-speed Internet customers. More than a year later after the launch of Prodigy Broadband (conceived and led by Chris Spanos), SBC bought controlling interest for $465 million when Prodigy was the fourth-largest Internet service provider behind America Online, Microsoft&#x27;s MSN, and EarthLink. Prodigy in 2000 was reported to have 3.1 million subscribers, of which 1.3 million were DSL customers.

Attempts by SBC to sell the Prodigy brand became public knowledge on December 9, 2005.

In late 2006, SBC purchased AT&amp;T Corporation and re-branded itself as AT&amp;T Inc. As of early 2007, there remained within AT&amp;T&#x27;s Internet operations a small group of former Prodigy employees located in AT&amp;T&#x27;s Austin, Texas, and White Plains, New York, facilities. What had started 27 years earlier as an AT&amp;T online experiment had come full circle.

Through 2009, the domain www.prodigy.net redirected to my.att.net, which appeared to be a Yahoo!-based content and search portal mainly linking to other online services.

AT&amp;T stopped serving Prodigy-created webpages in 2011, severing yet another tie with the brand.

As of March 6, 2024, www.prodigy.net redirects to https://currently.att.yahoo.com.

==Prodigy in Mexico==
In Mexico, Prodigy Internet is the main ISP with an estimated 92% of market share. It is also the leader in WiFi (hotspots) and broadband (DSL) access. The broadband service is called Prodigy Infinitum and is available in speeds of 512 kbit/s, 1024 kbit/s, 2048 kbit/s, 4096 kbit/s and 20480 kbit/s. The installation and DSL or fiber optic modem are free and it is no longer necessary to sign a two-year service contract. Prodigy Internet in Mexico is part of Telmex (Teléfonos de México) and its sister company Telnor (Teléfonos del Noroeste).

<text>Jon Llewellyn Kyl ( ; born April 25, 1942) is an American politician and lobbyist who served as a United States Senator for Arizona from 1995 to 2013. Following the death of John McCain in 2018, Kyl briefly returned to the Senate; his resignation led to the appointment of Martha McSally in 2019. A Republican, he held both of Arizona&#x27;s Senate seats at different times, serving alongside McCain during his first stint. Kyl was Senate Minority Whip from 2007 until 2013. He first joined the lobbying firm Covington &amp; Burling after retiring in 2013, then rejoined in 2019.
The son of U.S. Representative John Henry Kyl and Arlene (née Griffith) Kyl, Kyl was born and raised in Nebraska and lived for some time in Iowa. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree and law degree from the University of Arizona. He worked in Phoenix, Arizona as an attorney and lobbyist before winning election to the United States House of Representatives, where he served from 1987 to 1995. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994 and continued to be re-elected by comfortable margins until his retirement in January 2013. In 2006, he was recognized by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of America&#x27;s Ten Best Senators. Kyl was ranked by &quot;National Journal&quot; in 2007 as the fourth-most conservative U.S. Senator. He has been a fixture of Republican policy leadership posts, chairing the Republican Policy Committee (2003–2006) and the Republican Conference (2006–2007) before becoming Senate Minority Whip until his retirement in 2013. He was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2010 for his persuasive role in the Senate.

After leaving the Senate in 2013, Kyl worked as an attorney and lobbyist and then worked to shepherd the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh in 2018.

In September 2018, Kyl was appointed by Governor Doug Ducey to serve in the Class 3 Senate seat left vacant by the death of John McCain. Kyl is the first person to return to the Senate via appointment since New Hampshire Republican Norris Cotton in 1975. Kyl resigned from the Senate effective December 31, 2018, and was succeeded by Martha McSally.

== Early life, education and career ==
Kyl was born in Oakland, Nebraska, the son of Arlene (née Griffith) and John Henry Kyl, a teacher at Nebraska State Teachers College. His father served as a Congressman from Iowa after moving his family to Bloomfield, Iowa. After graduating from high school in 1960, Kyl attended the University of Arizona, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1964, graduating with honors. Kyl is a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, as is Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona. He then earned a law degree in 1966 at the University of Arizona&#x27;s James E. Rogers College of Law, and served as editor-in-chief of the &quot;Arizona Law Review&quot;. Before entering politics, he was a lawyer and lobbyist with Jennings, Strouss &amp; Salmon in Phoenix, Arizona. He also worked as an attorney at Mountain States Legal Foundation in Denver, Colorado, prior to running for office.

Kyl is a Presbyterian. Kyl is married to Caryll Collins, with whom he has had two children. They also have four grandchildren.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
Kyl served in the House of Representatives from 1987 to 1995. He was first elected in 1986 against Democrat Philip R. Davis, 65% to 35%. He was re-elected in 1988 against Gary Sprunk of the Libertarian Party, 87% to 13%; in 1990 against Democrat Mark Ivey Jr., 61% to 39%;

For his first six terms, Kyl represented most of the northeastern portion of the state, from heavily Republican northern Phoenix to the New Mexico border. Redistricting after the 1990 census carved away all of Kyl&#x27;s former territory outside the Valley of the Sun. The new 4th, however, was as safely Republican as its predecessor, and Kyl easily won reelection in 1992 against Democrat Walter R. Mybeck II, 59% to 27%.

== U.S. Senate (1995–2013) ==
=== Committee assignments ===
* Committee on the Judiciary
** United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism (Ranking Member)
** United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights
** United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security
* Committee on Finance
** United States Senate Finance Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight (Ranking Member)
** United States Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care
** United States Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy
* Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction

=== Leadership ===
Kyl was elected by his fellow Senate Republicans to a succession of leadership posts: Policy Committee chairman (2003–2007), Conference chairman (2007), and most recently (in December 2007), Senate Minority Whip. Kyl&#x27;s ascension to Minority Whip makes him the first Arizonan to hold such an influential Senate leadership post since Democrat Ernest W. McFarland served as Senate Majority Leader from 1951 to 1953. Kyl is the only Arizona Republican to hold that leadership position.

Judicial nominees

Kyl voted to confirm John Roberts as Chief Justice to the supreme court as well as Samuel Alito as associate justice. However, he voted against the nominations of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

== U.S. Senate (2018) ==

=== Appointment ===
On September 4, 2018, Kyl was appointed by Republican Arizona governor Doug Ducey to the state&#x27;s Class 3 U.S. Senate seat that had been vacated due to John McCain&#x27;s death until a 2020 special election could be held.

Kyl is only the sixth person to return to the Senate via appointment since the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment (mandating the direct election of U.S. senators) in 1913. The last preceding case had been Norris Cotton (New Hampshire) 
who in 1975 was appointed back to the Senate after the disputed election of 1974.

Kyl voted in favor of the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. He resigned from the Senate effective December 31, 2018, and was succeeded by congresswoman Martha McSally, a fellow Republican.

=== Committee assignments ===
* Committee on Armed Services
** Subcommittee on Airland 
** Subcommittee on Seapower
** Subcommittee on Strategic Forces
* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs
* Committee on Indian Affairs

== Political positions ==

Kyl is considered to be a conservative and was ranked by &quot;National Journal&quot; as the fourth-most conservative United States Senator in their March 2007 conservative/liberal rankings. In addition, in April 2006, Kyl was selected by &quot;Time Magazine&quot; as one of &quot;America&#x27;s 10 Best Senators&quot;; the magazine cited his successful behind-the-scene efforts as head of the Senate Republican Policy Committee. Senator Kyl has earned a 96.58% Lifetime Score from the American Conservative Union.

Kyl is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

=== Crime victims&#x27; rights ===
Kyl was one of the original sponsors, along with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, of an effort to amend the United States Constitution to protect crime victims&#x27; rights in the criminal justice system. When in 2004 it appeared that the constitutional amendment would not receive the requisite 2/3 support to pass the Senate, Kyl and Feinstein authored the Crime Victims&#x27; Rights Act, which listed a victims&#x27; bill of rights and provided mandamus relief in appellate court for any victim denied those rights. The act also offered sanctions against government officials who wantonly and willfully refused to comply with the Crime Victims&#x27; Rights Act.

=== Arms control ===
In November 2010, Kyl opposed the New START arms control treaty&#x27;s ratification in the lame-duck session. Nevertheless, the treaty passed 71–26, clearing the constitutionally mandated two-thirds threshold by the narrowest margin of any nuclear arms control treaty ever ratified by the United States.

=== Internet gambling ===
Kyl and Bob Goodlatte were among the first in the United States to draft legislation on online gambling. In the late 1990s they introduced bills to the Senate that would curb online gambling activities except for those that involved horse and dog races and state lotteries. The bill by Kyl, known as the Kyl bill, was not passed in the end due to certain loopholes. Attorney Jorge Van, at the time principal investigator of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission on Internet Gambling, pointed out that under the Kyl bill &quot;state lotteries would be able to offer a variety of games under the guise of a lottery, including slot machines&quot;, which ultimately would allow &quot;interactive wagering at home on the internet which the law aimed to prevent in the first place&quot;.

In September 2006, working with then-Congressman Jim Leach, Kyl was a major Senate supporter of Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. The Act was passed at midnight the day Congress adjourned before the 2006 elections. Prior to it being added to the bill, the gambling provisions had not been debated by any Congressional committee, although the general issue had been debated in multiple times in the past. When publication of the associated regulations was delayed until June 2010, Kyl responded by denying unanimous consent to confirm the appointment of 6 nominees to the U.S. Treasury Department, none of whom specialized on gambling issues.

=== Healthcare ===
Kyl voted against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

=== Other ===

In February 2006, Kyl joined Senator Lindsey Graham in an amicus brief in the &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; case. The brief presented to the Supreme Court of the United States an &quot;extensive colloquy&quot; added to the Congressional Record. It was not, however, included in the December 21 debate as evidence that &quot;Congress was aware&quot; that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 would strip the Court of jurisdiction to hear &quot;pending cases, including this case&quot; brought by the Guantanamo detainees.

In the spring of 2009, Kyl invited Geert Wilders to show his film &quot;Fitna&quot; to the United States Congress, which led to American Muslim protests.

In 2011, Kyl said that the GOP had abandoned opposition to defense cuts.

In 2012, Kyl voted against ratification of the UN Treaty Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

He opposed the FIRST STEP Act. The bill passed 87–12 on December 18, 2018.

== Activism ==

=== Zadroga Act ===
In 2010, Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid wanted the Senate to return to work on the week between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s in order to pass time-critical legislation including the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would ensure health coverage for 9/11 first responders. Kyl made a public comment that this would disrespect &quot;one of the two holiest of holidays for Christians and the families of all of the Senate.&quot; First responder Kenny Specht appeared on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and replied, &quot;You won&#x27;t find a single New York firefighter who considers it a sign of disrespect to work in a New York City firehouse on New Year&#x27;s Eve or New Year&#x27;s Day.&quot; The Zadroga Act passed on December 22.

=== Planned Parenthood ===
During a Senate debate on April 8, 2011, Kyl said that performing abortions is &quot;well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does&quot;. Planned Parenthood responded that 90 percent of its services are to provide contraception, STD and cancer testing and treatment, and only 3 percent are abortion-related. A spokesperson for Kyl later claimed the senator&#x27;s remark &quot;was not intended to be a factual statement but rather to illustrate that Planned Parenthood, an organization that receives millions in taxpayer dollars, does subsidize abortions.&quot; Politifact noted that Planned Parenthood&#x27;s numbers (from their most recent Annual Report, year ending June 30, 2009) are the result of self-reporting and that there is no national audit on such claims, but stated their belief that Kyl &quot;vastly overstated&quot; the number. Michael New, a political science professor writing at &quot;National Review&quot; suggested that perhaps Kyl&#x27;s comments were based on the pregnancy-related services provided to pregnant women, citing Planned Parenthood&#x27;s 2009 annual report figures and claiming that 98% of those services were for abortion. The phrase &quot;not intended to be a factual statement&quot; was mocked by political comedians such as Stephen Colbert, who joked, &quot;You can&#x27;t call him out for being wrong when he never intended to be right.&quot;

== Political campaigns ==

Kyl was first elected to the Senate in 1994, defeating Samuel G. Coppersmith (D), then a member of the House of Representatives, 54% to 40%. Libertarian Party candidate Scott Grainger got 6% of the votes.

Kyl was re-elected in 2000 without major-party opposition, with 79% of the vote. Independent William Toel got 8%; Green Party candidate Vance Hansen also got 8%; and Barry Hess of the Libertarian Party got 5%.

On November 7, 2006, Kyl defeated real estate developer and former Arizona Democratic Party chairman Jim Pederson to win his third term in the Senate. Kyl won with 53% of the vote; Pederson received 44%; and Libertarian Party candidate Richard Mack received 3%. The race was one of the most expensive in Arizona history, with Kyl raising more than $15 million and Pederson raising just shy of that amount.

A major issue in the campaign was illegal immigration. While in the Senate, Kyl cosponsored legislation that would give illegal immigrants up to five years to leave the country. Once there, they could apply for permanent residence or be guest workers. Since fellow Arizona Senator John McCain opposed this legislation, Pederson tried to use the issue as a way of allying with McCain and dividing Republicans in Arizona. Controversy also arose when each candidate accused the other of supporting the amnesty provisions in a 1986 immigration bill, although both candidates deny ever supporting those provisions.

<text>Simon, Simon is a 1970 British sound effect comedy short film directed by Graham Stark and starring Stark, Norman Rossington, John Junkin and Julia Foster. The film features a host of cameo appearances by veteran British comedians. The title comes from the Simon hydraulic platforms used in the film.

==Plot==
Two handymen cause chaos on a new crane while haphazardly trying to accomplish jobs for their ever more frustrated boss.

==Cast==

* Graham Stark as 1st workman
* Julia Foster as 1st typist
* Norman Rossington as fireman
* John Junkin as 2nd workman (driver)
* Paul Whitsun-Jones as the boss
* Audrey Nicholson as 2nd typist
* Kenneth Earle as thief
* Tommy Godfrey as cashier
* Tony Blackburn as fireman
* Michael Caine as himself
* David Hemmings as man in car with posters
* Bob Monkhouse as photographer
* Eric Morecambe as roof tiler
* Ernie Wise as painter/decorator
* Pete Murray as fireman
* Peter Sellers as man with two cars
* Bernie Winters as man on roof with book

== Critical reception ==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;With its squad of incompetent firemen, this mimed comedy was clearly intended to revive the silent slapstick tradition of the Keystone Cops. But the enterprise lacks pace. The film alternates between mechanical sight gags and an indulgent sentimentality underlined by Dennis King&#x27;s irrepressibly cute score. And while celebrated friends of the director make lightning appearances that should gratify the star spotters, the mime style of the principals involves much tiresome hand-wringing, eye-rolling and exaggerated mugging.&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: &quot;Unsung character actor Graham Stark made his debut as the writer and director of this fond, if laboured tribute to the silent slapstick style of the Keystone Kops. Comedy stars crop up in cameo roles, as does movie star Michael Caine. But the main focus falls on the rivalry between Stark&#x27;s council workman and fireman Norman Rossington, as they woo typist Julia Foster. The mugging mime and the excessive crane shots soon become wearisome, but it&#x27;s still fun.&quot;

<doc id="340576" wikidata="Q531978" url="?curid=340576" title="Shannon Hoon">
<text>Richard Shannon Hoon (September 26, 1967 – October 21, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. He was the lead singer of the band Blind Melon from 1990 until his death in 1995.

==Early life==

Hoon was born on September 26, 1967, in Lafayette, Indiana. He was raised in the nearby town of Dayton, Indiana, with his older half-sister, Anna and older half-brother, Tim. His father, Dick Hoon, was a bricklayer and his mother, Nel Hoon, was a manager of a bar in Dayton.

In high school, he played football, wrestled, and was a pole vaulter. Shannon&#x27;s musical influences included the Grateful Dead, The Beatles, John Lennon, and Bob Dylan. After graduating from McCutcheon High School in 1985, Hoon joined a local glam metal band named Styff Kytten, which also featured guitarist Michael Kelsey, bassist Brian Bundy and drummer Barry Koch. He took on the role of frontman and lead singer of the band. It was around this time that he wrote his first song and called it &quot;Change&quot;.

==Blind Melon==
In 1990, Hoon, left Indiana for Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, he met musicians Brad Smith and Rogers Stevens at a party. Smith and Stevens saw Hoon perform his song &quot;Change&quot; acoustically and invited Hoon to play with them. Christopher Thorn and Glen Graham were then brought into the fold, and by 1990 the five musicians decided to form Blind Melon. The band was possibly named for a term Smith&#x27;s father used to describe the neighborhood stoners; or for Blind Melon Chitlin, a character from a Cheech &amp; Chong album. In 1990, the new bandmates produced a four-song demo tape and subsequently signed a $500,000 recording contract with Capitol Records.

In Los Angeles, Hoon befriended his sister Anna&#x27;s high school friend Axl Rose, also a native of Lafayette, IN. Rose invited Hoon to join him in the studio where his band Guns N&#x27; Roses were recording their albums &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; (both released in 1991). Hoon sang backing vocals on several tracks, including &quot;The Garden&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. Rose also invited Hoon to appear in the video for &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;.

In 1992, Blind Melon released their self-titled debut album produced by Pearl Jam producer Rick Parashar. Blind Melon began touring to promote the album, supporting and opening for acts like BAD II, PIL, Ozzy Osbourne, Guns N&#x27; Roses, and Soundgarden over the course of 1992–1993. In the summer of 1993, the video for the album track &quot;No Rain&quot; was released as a single and featured a young girl, played by Heather DeLoach, in a bee costume, tap-dancing to unappreciative audiences. &quot;Blind Melon&quot; went multi-platinum.

Hoon and Blind Melon spent the next two years touring. In 1993, Hoon was arrested for indecent exposure after he undressed onstage and urinated on a fan at a show in Vancouver.

In 1994, Blind Melon appeared at Woodstock &#x27;94 where Hoon, allegedly high on LSD, went onstage wearing his girlfriend&#x27;s white dress.

After taking a hiatus from touring, Blind Melon returned to the studio to record the album &quot;Soup&quot; in New Orleans. &quot;Soup&quot; was released in 1995.

==Personal life and death==

Hoon entered a substance abuse rehabilitation facility in May 1994 and again in June 1995. On July 11, 1995, Hoon and his girlfriend, Lisa Crouse, had a daughter named Nico Blue.

In August, Blind Melon planned a tour to support their album &quot;Soup&quot;. A counselor was hired to accompany Hoon on the tour, but was let go after the first week.

After a disappointing performance at Numbers club in Houston on October 20, Hoon undertook an all-night drug binge. The next day, Blind Melon was scheduled to play a show in New Orleans at Tipitina&#x27;s. The band&#x27;s sound engineer, Lyle Eaves, went to the tour bus to awaken Hoon for a sound check, but Hoon was unresponsive. An ambulance arrived, and Hoon was pronounced dead at the scene at the age of 28. His death was attributed to a cocaine overdose.

Hoon was buried at Dayton Cemetery in Dayton, Indiana. His grave is inscribed with a line from Blind Melon&#x27;s song &quot;Change&quot;, the first song he wrote:

==Aftermath and legacy==

On November 12, 1996, Blind Melon released their final album featuring Hoon, &quot;Nico,&quot; as a tribute to him with all proceeds going to his daughter and to programs helping musicians deal with substance abuse. The band also released a video called &quot;Letters from a Porcupine&quot; that was nominated for Best Long Form Music Video at the Grammy Awards on February 25, 1997.

Blind Melon remained active for the next four years following Hoon&#x27;s death. The remaining members had planned to continue the band in memory of him and held auditions for a singer; however, they never managed to find a permanent replacement, and Blind Melon officially disbanded in 1999. After years of refusing to perform together out of respect for Hoon, the surviving members reformed Blind Melon in 2006, with Travis Warren taking his place.

On September 17, 2008, the book &quot;A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other: The Story of Shannon Hoon and Blind Melon&quot; by Greg Prato was published.

On September 15, 2018, photos of Hoon&#x27;s final performance with Blind Melon at the Numbers club in Houston on October 20, 1995, the day before he died, were released for the first time by fan Zak Joshua Rose, who took the pictures and claimed that he hung out with the band members except Hoon (who had disappeared) after the show.

A documentary about Hoon titled &quot;All I Can Say&quot; (composed mostly of footage he shot on a handheld camera from 1990 to 1995) premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 26, 2019, and was released on June 26, 2020, on online streaming platforms. Also, it was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 24, 2020. Hoon was co-credited as a &quot;director&quot; of the film.

On November 1, 2021, author Greg Prato issued a follow-up book to &quot;A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other&quot;, simply titled &quot;Shannon&quot;, and featured all-new interviews with either people who knew Shannon or were admirers of his music.

Since Hoon&#x27;s death, various musical artists have mentioned him in song lyrics, including Dream Theater (&quot;Just Let Me Breathe&quot;), Sun Kil Moon (&quot;Track Number 8&quot;), and the Avett Brothers (&quot;Smoke in Our Lights&quot;), while others have written songs inspired by him, including Zakk Wylde (&quot;Throwin&#x27; it All Away&quot;), The Used (&quot;Poetic Tragedy&quot;), and Econoline Crush (&quot;Sparkle and Shine&quot;).
A Scottish group, active from around 1998–2002, named themselves &quot;The Sempiternal Hoon&quot; in tribute to Shannon Hoon&#x27;s influence on their sound.

<text>A viceroyalty was an entity headed by a viceroy. It dates back to the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the sixteenth century.

==British Empire==
===India===
* India was governed by the Governor-General and Viceroy of India from 1858 to 1947, commonly shortened to &quot;Viceroy of India&quot;.
===Ireland===
* Ireland was governed by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who was the representative of the British Monarchy in Ireland from the Williamite period until independence, was also called the Viceroy of Ireland.

==France==
* Viceroyalty of New France
==Portuguese Empire==
In the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the term &quot;Viceroyalty of Brazil&quot; is also occasionally used to designate the colonial State of Brazil, in the historic period while its governors had the title of &quot;Viceroy&quot;. Some of the governors of Portuguese India were also called &quot;Viceroy&quot;.

==Spanish Empire==
The viceroyalty () was a local, political, social, and administrative institution, created by the Spanish monarchy in the sixteenth century, for ruling its overseas territories.

The administration over the vast territories of the Spanish Empire was carried out by viceroys, who became governors of an area, which was considered not as a colony but as a province of the empire, with the same rights as any other province in Peninsular Spain.

=== Europe ===
=== America and Asia ===
==== Controversy over whether the American Viceroyalties were Colonies or Provinces ====
According to the lawyer Fernando de Trazegnies, the status of the Viceroyalties was like that of a Kingdom among the Kingdoms of the Indies, and that the fact that legal Pluralism was practiced in Derecho Indiano would be sufficient proof that the Crown did not seek to practice a Exploitative colonialism (where local institutions, which protect the socioeconomic rights of the Vassal people, are ignored, under the excuse of the Right of Conquest), if not political integration into the Hispanic Monarchy in the same plural way that had already been done with the rest of its territories in Europe, based on the characteristic Fueros of the traditional and composite Monarchy that maintained the regional laws of each nation integrated into the Spanish Monarchy (and that was even practiced within peninsular Spain after the Reconquista, such as the Fueros of Aragón or the Fueros of Navarra). This would be evidenced by the creation of the República de Indios in which the political traditions of indigenous customary law would remain alive as a state within the several states that made up the Composite Monarchy, or the desire of the Spanish conquistadors to make pacts with the Natural Lords of the new lands (indigenous nobility and chiefs) to legitimize the conquest in natural law and integrate them into the seigneurial system, respecting the sovereignty of the natives and their ethnic lordships, which could not be deprived of their rights and was only possible its annexation to the Spanish Empire through alliance pacts (whose conditions of such pacts had to include the part of the indigenous sovereign, protector of the common Indian).

At the same time, the Spanish Empire itself and the Council of the Indies did not perceive the American Viceroyalties as possessions analogous to the Factories or administrative Colonies, in the style of other empires with a more Mercantilist behavior towards the Natives of their non-European possessions, but rather perceived the Viceroyalties as overseas Provinces, with rights equivalent in hierarchy to those of the rest of the provinces of the Crown of Castile (according to the Laws of the Indies), of which they were an integral part. Even the word colony would not have been used in any legal document of the Spanish Monarchy with respect to the Indies until the 17th century, and after the arrival of the Bourbons it would be used in reference to its classic etymological sense of human settlements established in new territories, and not in the modern sense with connotations of economic exploitation.

That would be reaffirmed in the late empire by official statements of the Supreme Central Junta (legal representative of occupied Spain in the middle of the Peninsular War).

Such statements would not have been questioned by American representatives in the Cortes of Cádiz, such as the Peruvian Vicente Morales Duárez.

However, there would still be historiographical debates in this regard, among those (the &quot;nationalist&quot; or &quot;colonialist school&quot;) who say that this was only De jure positions on paper, and not a De facto reality in social dynamics (the &quot;revisionist school&quot;). Authors such as Annick Lempérière consider that the “colonial” concept in Hispanic reality would have been an anachronistic concept that serves mostly an ideological use by historians (wanting to develop an idyllic vision of Spanish-American Independence) rather than to make a scientific description of the history of the Spanish empire, going so far as to question its apparent “objective” usefulness that modern historiography gave to the colonial concept to relate it to the causes of the Spanish-American Wars of Independence (that is, that there is an artificial consensus that American social formations, the Reinos de Indias and it&#x27;s viceroyalties, have been institutionally formed for their economic exploitation and dependence on the metropolis, instead of being an integral part of the Empire like any extension of the Crown, just like its European dominions).

<text>John Henry Kyl (May 9, 1919 – December 23, 2002) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Iowa&#x27;s 4th congressional district from 1959 to 1965 and again from 1967 to 1973. He was a member of the Republican Party.

== Early life and education ==
Kyl was born in Wisner, Nebraska, the son of Johanna (née Boonstra) and Jon George Kyl, both Dutch immigrants. He graduated from Nebraska State Teachers College (Wayne, Nebraska) and the University of Nebraska.

== Career ==
Kyl was a teacher at Nebraska State Teachers College from 1940 to 1950. In the 1950s, he moved to Bloomfield, Iowa, where he joined his brother George in the clothing business. He also worked as a television journalist for KTVO in Ottumwa, Iowa.

Kyl ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1958, losing to Steven V. Carter. However, Carter died on November 4, 1959, after less than one year in office. Kyl then won a special election to fill the vacancy. He continued to serve as the representative from Iowa&#x27;s 4th congressional district for two additional terms, but was defeated in the 1964 United States House of Representatives elections, in which Democrats gained 36 seats in the House. He recaptured his former seat in 1966, and then won re-election in 1968 and 1970. Reapportionment after the 1970 census put him into the same district as incumbent Democrat Neal Edward Smith, who defeated him in the 1972 election.

From 1973 to 1977, he served as Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Legislative Affairs in the United States Department of the Interior.

== Personal life ==
Kyl was married to Arlene (née Griffith), with whom he had three children, including Jon Kyl. Jon went on to serve as a three-term U.S. Senator from Arizona, from 1995 to 2013 and briefly in 2018. He also served as Senate Minority Whip.

<doc id="340594" wikidata="Q186924" url="?curid=340594" title="Hillel Slovak">
<text>Hillel Slovak (; April 13, 1962 – June 25, 1988) was an Israeli-American musician, best known as the founding guitarist of the Los Angeles rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, with whom he recorded two albums. His guitar work was rooted in funk and hard rock, and he often experimented with other genres, including reggae and speed metal. He is considered to have been a major influence on Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; early sound.

Born in Israel, he later moved to the United States. Slovak met future bandmates Anthony Kiedis, Flea, and Jack Irons while attending Fairfax High School in Los Angeles. There, he formed the group What Is This? with Irons, Alain Johannes, and Todd Strassman; Flea later replaced Strassman.

Slovak, Flea, Kiedis, and Irons founded Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1983, gaining popularity in Los Angeles through their energetic stage presence and spirited performances. Slovak eventually quit to focus on What is This?, which had been signed to a record deal, leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers to record their 1984 debut album without him, including five songs he co-wrote. Slovak rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1985 and recorded the albums &quot;Freaky Styley&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot; (1987) with them.

During his career, Slovak developed a serious heroin addiction. He attempted to rehabilitate several times but died of an overdose on June 25, 1988, at age 26. Several Red Hot Chili Peppers songs have been written as tributes to Slovak, including &quot;Knock Me Down&quot;, &quot;Otherside&quot; &quot;My Lovely Man&quot;, and &quot;Feasting on the Flowers&quot;. In 1999, his brother James published a book, &quot;Behind the Sun: The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak&quot;, which features Slovak&#x27;s diaries and paintings. Slovak was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 14, 2012, with his brother accepting the award on his behalf.

==Life and career==
===1962–1980: Early life and Anthym===
Hillel Slovak was born in Haifa, Israel, to Jewish parents who were survivors of the Holocaust. His mother was originally from Poland while his father grew up in Yugoslavia. The family immigrated to the United States when Slovak was four years old. They initially settled in the Queens borough of New York City before relocating to the Fairfax neighborhood of Los Angeles two years later. As a child, Slovak developed an interest in art, and often spent time painting with his mother, Esther. He attended Laurel Elementary School in West Hollywood and Bancroft Jr. High School in Hollywood, where he met future bandmates Jack Irons and Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary. Slovak received his first guitar at age 13 as a bar mitzvah present, and regularly played the instrument into the late hours of the night. During this time, he was highly influenced by hard rock music such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Kiss.

As a freshman at Fairfax High School, Slovak formed a band with Irons on drums and two other high school friends, Alain Johannes and Todd Strassman. They called their band Chain Reaction, then changed the name to Anthem after their first gig. After one of the group&#x27;s shows, Slovak met audience member Anthony Kiedis, and invited him to his house for a snack. Kiedis later described the experience in his autobiography &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;: &quot;Within a few minutes of hanging out with Hillel, I sensed that he was absolutely different from most of the people I&#x27;d spent time with ... He understood a lot about music, he was a great visual artist, and he had a sense of self and a calm about him that were just riveting.&quot; Slovak, Kiedis and Flea became best friends and often used LSD, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine recreationally.

The original bassist for Anthem, which renamed to Anthym, was deemed unsatisfactory, so Slovak began teaching Flea to play bass. Following several months of commitment to the instrument, Flea developed proficiency and a strong musical chemistry with Slovak. When Strassman saw Flea playing Anthym songs on his equipment he quit the band, with Flea quickly replacing him. Shortly afterwards Anthym entered a local Battle of the Bands contest and won second place. Anthym started to play at local nightclubs, despite the fact that the members were all underage. After graduating from high school, the band changed their name to What Is This?. Around the same time, Flea left the band to accept an offer to play bass in the prominent L.A. punk band Fear. What Is This? continued on and performed many shows along the California coast.

===1980–1982: Red Hot Chili Peppers formation===
Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea began to create their own music after finding inspiration in a punk-funk fusion band called Defunkt. The three formed a band with former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The band had only one song, entitled &quot;Out in L.A.&quot;, and was formed for the purpose of playing the song once. The song was based on a guitar riff that Slovak wrote while &quot;jamming&quot; with Irons, and was not meant to become a real song until Kiedis decided to rap over the music. Following the group&#x27;s first show at The Rhythm Lounge, the owner of the bar asked them to return, but with two songs instead of one. After several more shows, and the addition of several songs to their repertoire, the band&#x27;s name was changed to Red Hot Chili Peppers.

After the band started to gain popularity amongst the L.A. club scene, Kiedis began writing more lyrics. The lyrics would eventually become songs such as &quot;Green Heaven&quot; and &quot;True Men Don&#x27;t Kill Coyotes&quot;, and the band&#x27;s concert repertoire quickly grew to nine songs as a result of months of playing local nightclubs and bars. Over the course of the next six months, the Red Hot Chili Peppers played many shows in L.A. clubs and became something of an underground hit. Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea moved into a small house in a high-crime area in Hollywood where they collaborated musically and continued their drug addictions. The threesome traveled to New York City to perform more shows and to &quot;spread Chili Pepperdom&quot;. Shortly after the trip, Slovak moved out of the group&#x27;s shared house to live with his girlfriend.

===1982–1988: What is This? stint, &quot;Freaky Styley&quot;, and &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot;===
The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape and subsequently secured a record deal with EMI. Flea left Fear to pursue the Red Hot Chili Peppers. At the same time, What Is This? had also gotten a record deal. Since Slovak considered the Chili Peppers to merely be a side project and not a serious commitment, he left them to concentrate on What Is This?. Flea ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would suffer musically without him and Irons. He and Kiedis hired drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill Irons&#x27; and Slovak&#x27;s places, respectively. During the recording of the second What Is This? album, Slovak became frustrated with the band and contacted Flea about rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This came at an opportune time, as the group was dissatisfied with Slovak&#x27;s replacement, Jack Sherman. Kiedis felt that Sherman&#x27;s guitar work &quot;didn&#x27;t have the same spirit&quot; that Slovak contributed to the band&#x27;s sound. When Flea asked Kiedis how he felt about Slovak rejoining the band, Kiedis responded by saying, &quot;I&#x27;d give my firstborn son to get him back in the band.&quot; After the culmination of the promotional tour for their first album, Sherman was fired and Slovak rejoined the band.

Slovak returned to the Chili Peppers for their second album, &quot;Freaky Styley&quot;, which was released on August 16, 1985. What Is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid 1986 after Martinez was fired. The relationship between Flea, Slovak and Kiedis began to deteriorate as a result of excessive heavy drug use and addiction. Flea recalled that &quot;it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy&quot;. Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving the rest of the group to work on much of the album&#x27;s material by themselves. The band lived in Detroit for a portion of the recording of the album, where Kiedis and Slovak indulged in heavy cocaine use. When Slovak was under the influence, he would often wear brightly colored clothing and dance in a &quot;shuffling&quot; fashion, which became the inspiration for the song &quot;Skinny Sweaty Man&quot; from the band&#x27;s next album. After Kiedis completed a stint in rehab, he rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot;. Slovak felt a deep connection to the album; he reflected in his diary &quot;It was so fun. I&#x27;m so extremely proud of everybody&#x27;s work—it is at times genius.&quot; Slovak was the subject of the songs &quot;Skinny Sweaty Man&quot;, &quot;Me and My Friends&quot;, &amp; &quot;No Chump Love Sucker&quot;. He was nicknamed &quot;Slim Bob Billy&quot;, &quot;Slim&quot;, or &quot;Huckleberry&quot;, and throughout the albums Kiedis calls him by these nicknames before he starts a guitar solo. On &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot;, Slovak experimented with different musical styles, playing the sitar on the song &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;.

==Health decline==
Slovak and Kiedis became addicted to heroin early on in their careers, and Slovak often attempted to conceal his addiction from his friends and family. At first, the band were more concerned about Kiedis&#x27; addiction, which had become more apparent to the other members due to his willingness to openly discuss his issues. Kiedis was more upfront about his problems while Slovak according to Kiedis was &quot;much more subtle and much more cunning in his disguise.&quot; During the tour in support of &quot;Freaky Styley&quot;, Slovak&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. Slovak and Flea would wrestle regularly on tour, but Slovak became too weak to participate. Kiedis commented on the situation: &quot;I could tell that Hillel had no inner core of strength; he had been robbed by his addiction of the life force that allows you to at least defend yourself. It was a sad moment.&quot; A roadie of the band who was concerned for Slovak&#x27;s health contacted his brother, James, who had been unaware that Slovak had ever used heroin.

Deciding to give sobriety a chance, both Kiedis and Slovak stopped using drugs prior to their European tour in support of &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot;, and decided to help each other &quot;steer clear&quot; of heroin. An entry from Slovak&#x27;s diary on January 21, 1988, discusses his attempts to &quot;begin a new drug-free phase of life&quot;. During the tour both experienced intense heroin withdrawal, with Slovak much more unstable than Kiedis. His withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his ability to play his instrument; at one point Slovak had a mental breakdown and was unable to play a show, leaving the rest of the band to play an entire set with no guitar. He recovered a few days later, but was briefly kicked out of the band and replaced by DeWayne McKnight for a few shows. After a few days with McKnight, the band decided to give Slovak another chance, and he rejoined for the European leg of the tour. Kiedis attempted to take Slovak to drug addiction counseling, but Slovak had difficulty admitting that his addiction was serious enough to require medical help.

==Death==
Upon returning home, Slovak isolated himself from the rest of his bandmates, and struggled to resist drug abuse without the support of his friends, and Kiedis in particular. He stopped painting and writing in his diary during this time, and little is known about his life during the weeks following the tour, aside from a phone call to his brother on June 24, in which Slovak told him that he was having difficulty staying clean despite his desire to stop taking heroin. A few weeks after the band returned from the tour, the members attempted to contact Slovak, but were unable to do so for several days. Slovak died in his Hollywood apartment on June 25, 1988 although his body was not discovered until two days later. On June 27, 1988, Slovak&#x27;s body was found slumped over the painting he had been working on at the time of his death, he was found holding a cigarette which had burnt a hole in the canvas of the painting. After completion of the autopsy, authorities confirmed that the official cause of death was due to an accidental heroin overdose. He is interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Hollywood Hills, California.

Following Slovak&#x27;s death, Kiedis fled town and did not attend the funeral, considering the situation to be surreal. Although he found the death to be a shock, he was not initially &quot;scared straight&quot; and continued to use heroin. However, a few weeks later, a friend convinced him both to check into rehab and visit Slovak&#x27;s grave, which inspired him to get clean. Irons was unable to cope with Slovak&#x27;s death and subsequently left the band, saying that he did not want to be part of something that resulted in the death of his friends. This did not end Irons&#x27; musical career, however, as he would work with Johannes on several projects, including the band Eleven, and would join Pearl Jam for a period in the 1990s after initially declining to join the band upon its founding. Kiedis and Flea decided to continue making music, hoping to continue what Slovak &quot;helped build&quot;. They hired DeWayne McKnight and D.H. Peligro as replacements, who were later replaced by Chad Smith and John Frusciante.

==Musical style and legacy==

Slovak was primarily influenced by hard rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Santana, and Led Zeppelin. His playing method was markedly based on improvisation, a style commonly used in funk music. He was also noted he would often play with such force that his fingers would &quot;come apart.&quot; Kiedis observed that his playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This?, with Slovak adopting a more fluid style featuring &quot;sultry&quot; elements as opposed to his original hard rock techniques. On &quot;Uplift&quot;, Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal. His guitar riffs would often serve as the basis of the group&#x27;s songs, with the other members writing their parts to complement his guitar work. His melodic riff featured in the song &quot;Behind the Sun&quot; inspired the group to create &quot;pretty&quot; songs with an emphasis on melody. Kiedis describes the song as &quot;pure Hillel inspiration&quot;. Slovak also used a talk box on songs such as &quot;Green Heaven&quot; and &quot;Funky Crime&quot;, in which the sounds of his amplified guitar would be played through a tube into his mouth and then back into a microphone, creating psychedelic, voice-like effects. Slovak helped to incorporate new sounds in the group&#x27;s work, including adding occasional drum machines. Despite the fact that the group billed itself as &quot;The Organic Anti-Beat Box Band&quot;, Kiedis states that Slovak showed the group that drum machines could be used as artistic instruments.

Slovak&#x27;s work was one of the major contributing factors to Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; early sound. When Kiedis and Flea were searching for a new guitarist to replace Slovak, Kiedis likened the experience to &quot;shopping for a new Mom and Dad&quot; because of his influence over the band. Flea, who originally listened exclusively to jazz, added that Slovak introduced him to a new genre of music, saying that &quot;it was Hillel who first got me into hard rockin. He was also a huge influence on a young John Frusciante, who would later replace him as guitarist in the band. Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak&#x27;s work, and explained, &quot;I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel&#x27;s playing and I just took it sideways from there.&quot; Just like Slovak before him, Frusciante developed a heroin addiction. Unlike Slovak, Frusciante eventually managed to break and defeat the habit. The songs &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; (from &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;), &quot;My Lovely Man&quot; (from &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;), &quot;This is the Place&quot; (from &quot;By the Way&quot;), and &quot;Feasting on the Flowers&quot; (from &quot;The Getaway&quot;) were written about or as tributes to Slovak. The title of the song &quot;Otherside&quot; (from &quot;Californication&quot;) is also a tribute to Slovak. The band&#x27;s 1987 cover version of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s song &quot;Fire&quot;, recorded with Slovak and previously only released on the &quot;Fight Like a Brave&quot; single and &quot;The Abbey Road EP&quot;, was included on 1989&#x27;s &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; along with an image of one of Slovak&#x27;s paintings inside the album&#x27;s booklet. In 1999, a book titled &quot;Behind the Sun: The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak&quot; was published. The book was authored by Slovak&#x27;s brother, James Slovak, and features writings from his brother&#x27;s diaries, paintings, photos and hand-written notes from Kiedis and Flea.

On December 7, 2011, Red Hot Chili Peppers were announced as 2012 inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Slovak&#x27;s brother James accepted the award on his behalf and gave a speech honoring his brother. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Kiedis expressed his excitement with Slovak&#x27;s induction, explaining &quot;He&#x27;s a beautiful person that picked up a guitar in the 1970s and didn&#x27;t make it out of the 1980s, and he is getting honored for his beauty&quot;. Flea echoed those comments on the same day: &quot;Hillel grew up loving rock and roll so much, he hasn&#x27;t been here for some time, but I know how much it would mean to him. It&#x27;s a powerful thing.&quot;

<doc id="340596" wikidata="Q6471998" url="?curid=340596" title="Lagentium">
<text>Lagentium or Legiolum was the Roman name for the fort and surrounding civilian settlement which was built around the year 74 by the Roman Empire. The English town of Castleford, West Yorkshire, is now built on what was the fort.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Lagentium&quot; may be of Brittonic origin. The name may involve the element &quot;lagīnā-&quot;, with connotations of &quot;spear&quot; and &quot;blade&quot;, with the suffix &quot;-tjo-&quot; affixed. Andrew Breeze revived the proffering that &quot;Lagentium&quot; was based on an ethnic name.

== History ==
Around this time, the Romans first fought the Brigantes, who occupied most of what is now Yorkshire and the North East, along with parts of Lancashire. The Romans named this new settlement Lagentium. They built a turf and timber fort sometime in the early 70s to guard the river crossings and the vital road to the north. The fort was built on either a natural ridge or a man-made mound, we are not certain. The Roman engineers chose Lagentium for its strongly strategic position. The mound offered a strong and clear vantage point, and the river offered a source of water and food. The low crossing point also had the advantage that both sides of the river could be farmed on. So a fort was built on top of a Brigantian settlement. Over the sixty years since the fort was built, permanent shops and gardens were built, and traders began to arrive.

The fort was garrisoned for 24 years by the Roman army, to keep the Brigantes under control. The Romans simply believed that the Brigantes were &#x27;barbarians&#x27;, but peace was eventually established and the troops were moved to the north. The Brigantes were not the most advanced of British Tribes, but the few Brigantes that did accept Roman law were allowed to experience greatly enhanced living conditions, under the watchful eye of the Romans.
Around 43, a road known as Ermine Street ran from the south to the north, but the Romans had to cross the Humber estuary to get to the other side of the road. The estuary was two miles wide, and the river had raging currents, and was subject to strong winds, making any crossing very difficult. Also, the Romans were not keen sailors, so this route north was not appropriate. So the Romans built another road, locally known as Roman Ridge and often considered a branch of Dere Street or Watling Street, with numerous forts strategically positioned along it. Lagentium, along with what is now Littleborough, Bawtry, Tadcaster and Doncaster, was one of these forts.

The fort built in Castleford shared many of the luxuries of any Roman settlement. In the vicus (a settlement just outside the fort) there were temples, houses, shops, alehouses (public house), public bathhouses and brothels. Many other improvements were made to Lagentium, including straight metalled roads, rectangular stone buildings with tiled roofs and glazed windows; the houses had drains and sometimes central heating.

Around 180 Lagentium was abandoned, as the Roman Empire withdrew its legions. The Brigantes returned to power and reoccupied Lagentium around 250, Their culture, now called Romano-British, had been profoundly influenced by that of the Romans. There were no significant changes from the time the Romans had left to the Middle Ages. The Brigantes allowed the fort to grow over, and they continued with the farming way of life that they had had for centuries.

After the Norman Conquest of England in 1066: the land was split up and given to the King&#x27;s knights. The land in Castleford, Pontefract, Leeds, Wakefield and Morley was given to Ilbert de Lacey. Castleford continued to be a farming village, and remained as one until the Industrial Revolution.

<text>Zinnia is a genus of plants of the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae. They are native to scrub and dry grassland in an area stretching from the Southwestern United States to South America, with a centre of diversity in Mexico. Members of the genus are notable for their solitary long-stemmed 12 petal flowers that come in a variety of bright colors. The genus name honors the German scientist Johann Gottfried Zinn (1727–1759).

==Description==
Zinnias are annuals, shrubs, and sub-shrubs native primarily to North America, with a few species in South America. Most species have upright stems but some have a lax habit with spreading stems that mound over the surface of the ground. They typically range in height from 10 to 100 cm tall (4&quot; to 40&quot;). The leaves are opposite and usually stalkless (sessile), with a shape ranging from linear to ovate, and a color ranging from pale to medium green. Zinnia&#x27;s composite flowers consist of ray florets that surround disk florets, which may be a different color than the ray florets and mature from the periphery inward. The flowers have a range of appearances, from a single row of petals to a dome shape. Zinnias may be white, chartreuse, yellow, orange, red, purple, or lilac.

==Cultivation==
Zinnias are easy to grow with potential heavy, brightly colored blooms. Their petals can take different forms as single row with a visible center (single-flowered zinnia), numerous rows with a center that is not visible (double-flowered) and petals that are somewhere in-between with numerous rows but visible centers (semi-double-flowered zinnia). Their flowers can also take several shapes.

Zinnias are an annual plant usually grown &quot;in situ&quot; from seed, as they dislike being transplanted. Much like daisies, zinnias prefer to have full sunlight and adequate water. In the preferred conditions they will grow quickly but are sensitive to frost and therefore will die after the first frost of autumn. Zinnias benefit from deadheading to encourage further blooming.

&quot;Zinnia elegans&quot;, also known as &quot;Zinnia violacea&quot;, is the most familiar species, originally from the warm regions of Mexico being a warm–hot climate plant. Its leaves are lance-shaped and sandpapery in texture, and height ranges from 15 cm to 1 meter.

&quot;Zinnia angustifolia&quot; is another Mexican species. It has a low bushy plant habit, linear foliage, and more delicate flowers than &quot;Z. elegans&quot; – usually single, and in shades of yellow, orange or white. It is also more resistant to powdery mildew than &quot;Z. elegans&quot;, and hybrids between the two species have been raised which impart this resistance to plants intermediate in appearance between the two. The &#x27;Profusion&#x27; cultivars, with both single and double-flowered components, are among the most well-known of this hybrid group.

Zinnias is favored by butterflies as well as hummingbirds, and many gardeners add zinnias specifically to attract them.
==Uses==
Zinnias are popular garden flowers because they come in a wide range of flower colors and shapes, and they can withstand hot summer temperatures and are easy to grow from seeds. They bloom all summer long. They are grown in fertile, humus-rich, and well-drained soil, in an area with full sun. They will reseed themselves each year. Over 100 cultivars have been produced since selective breeding started in the 19th century.

&quot;Zinnia peruviana&quot; was introduced to Europe in the early 1700s. Around 1790 &quot;Z&quot;. &quot;elegans&quot; (&quot;Zinnia violacea&quot;) was introduced. Those plants had a single row of ray florets, which were violet. In 1829, scarlet flowering plants were available under the name &quot;Coccinea&quot;. Double flowering types were available in 1858, coming from India, and they were in a range of colors, including shades of reds, rose, purple, orange, buff, and rose striped. In time, they came to represent &quot;thinking of absent friends&quot; in the language of flowers.

A number of species of zinnia are popular flowering plants, and interspecific hybrids are becoming more common. Their varied habits allow for uses in several parts of a garden, and their tendency to attract butterflies and hummingbirds is seen as desirable. Commercially available seeds and plants are derived from open pollinated or F1 crosses, and the first commercial F1 hybrid dates from 1960.

Some zinnias are edible, though often reported to have a bitter taste best suited to garnish.

==Cultivation in microgravity==

Experimentation aboard the International Space Station has demonstrated the capability of zinnias to blossom in a weightless environment, an example of plants in space.

==Companion plants==
In the Americas their ability to attract hummingbirds is also seen as useful as a defense against whiteflies, and therefore zinnias are a desirable companion plant, benefiting plants that are inter-cropped with it.

<text>Paul V. Mockapetris (born 1948 in Boston, Massachusetts, US) is an American computer scientist and Internet pioneer, who invented the Internet Domain Name System (DNS).

==Education==
Mockapetris graduated from the Boston Latin School in 1966, received his bachelor&#x27;s degrees in physics and electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1971 and his doctorate in information and computer science from the University of California at Irvine in 1982.

==Career==
In 1983, he proposed a Domain Name System architecture in RFC 882 and RFC 883. He had recognized the problem in the early Internet (then ARPAnet) of holding name to address translations in a single table on the hosts file of an operating system. Instead he proposed a distributed and dynamic DNS database: essentially DNS as it exists today.

==Achievements==
Mockapetris is a fellow of the IEEE and the Association for Computing Machinery. He:
* joined the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of the University of Southern California (USC) in 1978, where he:
** developed the first SMTP email server, 
** proposed the DNS architecture in 1983, 
** wrote the first DNS implementation (called &quot;Jeeves&quot;) for the TOPS-20 in 1983,
** served as director of the high performance computing and communications division; 
* was program manager for networking at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense from 1990 to 1993;
* served as chair of the Research Working Group of the U.S. Federal Networking Council; 
* served as chair of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) from 1994 to 1996;
* was a member of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) in 1994 and 1995; 
* worked for several Internet-related companies: employee number two at @Home (1995–1997), Software.com (1997–1998) (now OpenWave), Fiberlane (now Cisco), Cerent/Siara (now Redback Networks) (1998–1999), Urban Media (1999–2001), and NU Domain (from 1999);
* was Chief Scientist and chairman of the Board of IP address infrastructure software provider Nominum (1999 to 2016).
* is currently Chief Scientist at ThreatSTOP.

==Awards==
* 1997 John C. Dvorak Telecommunications Excellence Award &quot;Personal Achievement - Network Engineering&quot; for DNS design and implementation 
* 2002 Distinguished Alumnus award from the University of California, Irvine 
* 2003 IEEE Internet Award for his contributions to DNS
* 2004 ACM Fellow, for contributions to the Internet, including the development of domain and email protocols.
* 2005 ACM SIGCOMM Award for lifetime contribution to the field of communication networks in recognition of his foundational work in designing, developing and deploying the Domain Name System, and his sustained leadership in overall Internet architecture development
* 2006 ACM SIGCOMM Test of Time Paper Award for co-authoring paper &quot;Development of the Domain Name System&quot;
* 2006 National Academy of Engineering Member
* 2012 inducted by the Internet Society into the Internet Hall of Fame as an &quot;innovator&quot;
* 2013 Honoris Causa (honorary degree) by Miguel Hernández University (Alicante, Spain)
* 2019 ACM Software System Award

<text>A nilometer is a structure for measuring the Nile River&#x27;s clarity and water level during the annual flood season in Egypt. There were three main types of nilometers, calibrated in Egyptian cubits: (1) a vertical column, (2) a corridor stairway of steps leading down to the Nile, and (3) a deep well with a culvert. If the water level was low, the fertility of the floodplain would suffer. If it was too high, the flooding would be destructive. There was a specific mark that indicated how high the flood should be if the fields were to get good soil.

Nilometers originated in pharaonic times, were also built in Roman times, and were highly prevalent in Islamic Egypt in Rashidun, Ummayad, Abbasid, Tulunid, Mamluk, Alawiyya and Republican periods, until the Aswan Dam rendered them obsolete in the 1960s.

==Description==

Between July and November, the reaches of the Nile running through Egypt would burst their banks and cover the adjacent floodplain. When the waters receded, around September or October, they left behind a rich alluvial deposit of exceptionally fertile black silt over the croplands. The &quot;akhet&quot;, or Season of the Inundation, was one of the three seasons into which the ancient Egyptians divided their year.

The annual flood was of great importance to Egyptian civilization. A moderate inundation was a vital part of the agricultural cycle; however, a lighter inundation than normal would cause famine, and too much flood water would be equally disastrous, washing away much of the infrastructure built on the flood plain. Records from AD 622999 indicate that, on average, 28% of the years saw an inundation that fell short of expectations.
Across Egypt various nilometers could be found that recorded readings of the Nile&#x27;s annual levels. A fragment of a recovered Egyptian stele &quot;Royal Annals of the Old Kingdom&quot; known as the &quot;Palermo stone&quot; deemed to be from the times of the First Dynasty around 3,000 B.C.E. The Palermo Stone reports systems of measurements utilizing units such as cubits, palms, and fingers.

The ability to predict the volume of the coming inundation was part of the mystique of the ancient Egyptian priesthood. The same skill also played a political and administrative role, since the quality of the year&#x27;s flood was used to determine the levels of tax to be paid. This is where the nilometer came into play, with priests monitoring the day-to-day level of the river and announcing the awaited arrival of the summer flood.

Religious attributes related to the Nile intertwined with the ideology or belief in Ma&#x27;at (a system of natural balance). Nilometers were accessible to only members of the city&#x27;s priests and nobles. The restriction on who may access these structures ensured both accountability in proper readings and political control for the religious communities and ruling classes.

==Designs==
The simplest nilometer design is a vertical column submerged in the waters of the river, with marked intervals indicating the depth of the water. One that follows this simple design, albeit housed in an elaborate and ornate stone structure, can still be seen on the island of Roda in central Cairo This nilometer visible today dates as far back as AD 861, when the Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil ordered its construction, overseen by the astronomer al-Farghani. Another nilometer had been ordered in 715 by Usāma b. Zayd b. ʿAdī, who was in charge of collecting the land tax (&quot;kharaj&quot;) in Egypt for the Umayyad caliph Sulaymān ibn ʿAbd al-Malik.
The second nilometer design comprises a flight of stairs leading down into the water, with depth markings along the walls. The best known example of this kind can be seen on Elephantine in Aswan, where a stairway of 52 steps leads down to a doorway at the Nile. This location was also particularly important, since for much of Egyptian history, Elephantine marked Egypt&#x27;s southern border and was therefore the first place where the onset of the annual flood was detected.

The most elaborate design involved a canal or culvert that led from the riverbank – often running for a considerable distance – and then fed a well, tank, or cistern. These nilometer wells were most frequently located within the confines of temples, where only the priests and rulers were allowed access. A particularly fine example, with a deep, cylindrical well and a culvert opening in the surrounding wall, can be seen at the Temple of Kom Ombo, to the north of Aswan.

==History==
While nilometers originated in Pharaonic times, they continued to be used by the later civilizations that held sway in Egypt. Some were constructed in Roman times. In the 20th century, the Nile&#x27;s annual inundation was first greatly reduced, and then eliminated entirely, with the construction of the Aswan dams. While the Aswan High Dam&#x27;s impact on Egypt and its agriculture has been controversial for other, more complex reasons, it has also had the additional effect of rendering the nilometer obsolete.

=== Roda Island ===
The first nilometer on Roda Island was constructed by Usama bin Zayd bin Adl before Jumada II, 96 AH (February 715), during the reign of the Umayyad caliph al-Walid. The 14th-century Arabic historian Maqrīzī claims that the construction cost 24,000 dirhams. During the reign of Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik, Usama wrote to the caliph informing him of the dilapidated state of the nilometer. He received a reply ordering him to construct a new one, which he did in 97 AH (5 September 715—24 August 716). Yaqut al-Hamawi, writing in the 12th–13th centuries, claims that in the beginning of year 247 AH (March 861), during Yazid ibn Abd Allah al-Turki&#x27;s governorship of Egypt, the Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil had the &#x27;new&#x27; nilometer constructed and ordered that the privilege of measuring the river &#x27;be taken away from the Christians.&#x27; The governor then appointed a man from Basra named Abu&#x27;r-Raddad who had emigrated to Egypt and taught hadith. He died in 266 AH (879/80), with Yaqut claiming &#x27;the supervision of the Nilometer has remained in the hands of his descendants until the present day&#x27; (which would have been around 1225 for the author). Ibn Khallikan, a 13th-century historian, gives a different account of this nilometer, recounting that a &#x27;pious&#x27; muezzin in the old Mosque of Amr wished to carve inscriptions in various places of the nilometer. After consulting with Yazid ibn Abd Allah, Sulayman ibn Wahb and Hasan al-Khadim, the muezzin proposed to inscribe various Qu&#x27;ranic passages in the name of al-Mutawakkil. Sulayman ibn Wahb then wrote to the caliph, who replied in writing to choose verses of the Qu&#x27;ran &#x27;most appropriate&#x27; to the nilometer and to inscribe the caliph&#x27;s name.

Ibn Khallikan writes that the architect of the nilometer was Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Hasib. Abu Ja&#x27;far al-Katib and Ibn Abi Usaybi&#x27;a mention that Ahmad ibn Kathir al-Farghani was sent to Fustat by al-Mutawakkil to supervise the construction. Abu al-Mahasin Yusuf (d. 1604) makes the same statement but calls him Muhammad ibn Kathir al-Farghani (full name: Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathir al-Farghani). For this reason, Gaston Wiet and Creswell argue that the al-Farghani and al-Hasib are the same person.

In 872–3 (259 AH), Ahmad ibn Tulun, the autonomous ruler of Egypt, would also have the nilometer restored. Al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s name was removed from the Kufic inscription of the nilometer. K. A. C. Creswell states that the main inscription of the nilometer was probably tampered with by Ibn Tulun, saying &quot;there can be little doubt that it was he who removed the name of the Abbasid Khalif.&quot; Ibn Tulun would however refrain from substituting his own name, with Creswell claiming as he did not feel sufficiently secure to do so. The first Tulunid Emir during 872-873 would spend 1,000 dinars on works carried out on the nilometer. Consequently, according to Abdul Rofik Bruno, the Nile&#x27;s irrigation would be enhanced, and agricultural output increased.

Amr ibn al-As after the conquest of Egypt reported to the Caliph Umar that when the Nile rose to 14 cubits there was a sufficient harvest, 16 an abundant harvest, 17 being the most advantageous height of all, and that at 18, one-fourth of Egypt would be inundated and usually be followed by plague. The Baghdad doctor, Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi who traveled Egypt between 1192-1201 would also relate similar measurements. In the exceedingly low water levels of 1201 and 1202, the nilometer remained dry. In 1201, the year commenced with a rise in 2 cubits before rising an average 15¹⁶⁄₂₄ cubits. In 1202, the year began with 1½ cubits before rising to 15²³⁄₂₄ cubits. During the Abbasid Period, the nilometer was used to measure the river level and hence determine the rates of tax in Egypt.

In 1937, efforts to drain and excavate the nilometer were begun by Kamil Bey Ghalib, the Under-Secretary of State for Public Works, employing a new method used by Rothpletz and Lienhard. In this method, the mud could be removed completely and the structure examined.

<doc id="340613" wikidata="Q7049261" url="?curid=340613" title="Non-denominational Christianity">
<text>Non-denominational Christianity (or nondenominational Christianity) consists of churches, and individual Christians, which typically distance themselves from the confessionalism or creedalism of other Christian communities by not formally aligning with a specific Christian denomination.

In North America, nondenominational Christianity arose in the 18th century through the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement, with followers organizing themselves simply as &quot;Christians&quot; and &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot;. The nondenominational movement saw expansion during the 20th century Jesus movement era, which popularized contemporary Christian music and Christian media within global pop culture.

Many nondenominational churches adhere to congregationalist polity, while others are governed by elders. Some nondenominational churches are independent, while others cooperate in loose associations such as the Churches of Christ; in other cases, nondenominational churches are founded by individual pastors such Calvary Chapel Association established by Chuck Smith. Some non-denominational churches have grown quite recently within networks like Acts 29. Certain nondenominational churches are associated with various movements in Christendom, such as evangelicalism or Charismatic Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pew Research Center/ America&#x27;s Changing Religious Landscape&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nondenominational Christianity first arose in the 18th century through the Stone–Campbell Restoration Movement, with followers organizing themselves simply as &quot;Christians&quot; and &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot;. Congregations in this tradition of nondenominational Christianity often refer to themselves as Churches of Christ or Christian churches. Sometimes the name &quot;Independent Christian Church&quot; is used to differentiate the congregation from the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the group of Stone–Cambpell churches which formed a denomination over the course of the early and mid 20th century.

Independent nondenominational churches continued to appear in the United States in the course of the 20th century.

Nondenominational congregations experienced significant and continuous growth in the 21st century, particularly in the United States. In 2010, there were 35,496 nondenominational churches in the US with over 12 million congregants.

If combined into a single group, nondenominational churches collectively represented the third-largest Christian grouping in the United States in 2010, after the Roman Catholic Church and Southern Baptist Convention.

In Asia, especially in Singapore and Malaysia, these churches are also more numerous, since the 1990s.

== Characteristics ==
Nondenominational churches are by definition not affiliated with any specific denominational stream of Christianity, whether by choice from their foundation or because they separated from their denomination of origin at some point in their history. Like denominational congregations, nondenominational congregations vary in size, worship, and other characteristics. Although independent, many nondenominational congregations choose to affiliate with a broader network of congregations.

Many nondenominational churches can nevertheless be positioned in existing movements, such as Evangelicalism and Pentecostalism, even though they are autonomous and have no formal labels.

Nondenominational churches may include certain megachurches, while other megachurches are affiliated with large denominations, such as Frazer Free Methodist Church.

Certain neo-charismatic churches often use the term &quot;nondenominational&quot; to define themselves.

Many non-denominational churches identify solely with Christianity, rather than a specific branch of it (Catholicism, Protestantism, Orthodoxy, and Restorationism). Most &quot;other Christians&quot; in America belong to nondenominational churches.

Citing data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study and General Social Survey, political scientist and statistician Ryan Burge noted that nondenominational Christians are very similar to Southern Baptists, but with some caveats. Burge writes, &quot;Nondenominational churches are typically younger and more racially diverse than Southern Baptist churches. On religious matters, both groups attend church at the same rate, yet nondenominationals are more likely to hold a moderate theological position on the Bible than SBC churchgoers. Finally, when it comes to politics it seems that Southern Baptists and nondenominational Christians are very similar. Nondenominational parishioners are slightly more supportive of same-sex marriage and slightly less supportive of abortion rights, but these differences are small.&quot;

==Criticism==
Boston University religion scholar Stephen Prothero argues that nondenominationalism hides the fundamental theological and spiritual issues that initially drove the division of Christianity into denominations behind a veneer of &quot;Christian unity&quot;. He argues that nondenominationalism encourages a descent of Christianity—and indeed, all religions—into comfortable &quot;general moralism&quot; rather than being a focus for facing the complexities of churchgoers&#x27; culture and spirituality. Prothero further argues that it also encourages ignorance of the Scriptures, lowering the overall religious literacy while increasing the potential for inter-religious misunderstandings and conflict.

Harmon, a Baptist theologian who supports ecumenism, argues that &quot;there&#x27;s really no such thing&quot; as a nondenominational church, because &quot;as soon as a supposedly non-denominational church has made decisions about what happens in worship, whom and how they will baptize, how and with what understanding they will celebrate holy communion, what they will teach, who their ministers will be and how they will be ordered, or how they relate to those churches, these decisions have placed the church within the stream of a specific type of denominational tradition&quot;. Harmon argues that the cause of Christian unity is best served through denominational traditions, since each &quot;has historical connections to the church&#x27;s catholicity ... and we make progress toward unity when the denominations share their distinctive patterns of catholicity with one another&quot;.

Presbyterian dogmatic theologian Amy Plantinga Pauw writes that Protestant nondenominational congregations &quot;often seem to lack any acknowledgement of their debts and ties to larger church traditions&quot; and argues that &quot;for now, these non-denominational churches are living off the theological capital of more established Christian communities, including those of denominational Protestantism&quot;. Pauw considers denominationalism to be a &quot;unifying and conserving force in Christianity, nurturing and carrying forward distinctive theological traditions&quot; (such as Wesleyanism being supported by Methodist denominations).

In 2011, American evangelical professor Ed Stetzer attributed to individualism the reason for the increase in the number of evangelical churches claiming to be nondenominational Christianity.

Ryan Burge argues that nondenominational churches are less equipped to monitor or report sexual abuse cases because they lack national organizations to do so. Because of nondenominational churches lack of organizational structure, accountability is minimal.

In an article on evangelical clergy sex abuse in &quot;The New Republic&quot; by Elle Hardy, religious studies scholar Matthew D. Taylor argues that the relative lack of accountability in nondenominational churches attract pastors &quot;who are more megalomaniacal and authoritarian in their personality”. Since nondenominational churches lack a hierarchy to answer to, pastors with authoritarian personalities are given more opportunities to exert power and control over their congregants. Nondenominational preachers claim to have oversight from their boards and mentorship from &quot;spiritual parents&quot;, but these are usually people they know. Taylor argues, “They’re incentivized to protect their friends and protect the oligarchy. They all have a stake in it, and none of them have personal incentives other than principled theological convictions to actually hold their friends accountable, so that the incentives all push in the direction of abuse and cover-up rather than in the direction of accountability and exposure.”

<text>William Lee Shoemaker (August 19, 1931 – October 12, 2003) was an American jockey, considered one of the greatest. For 29 years he held the world record for the most professional jockey victories.

==Early life==

Referred to as &quot;Bill&quot;, &quot;Willie,&quot; and &quot;The Shoe&quot;, William Lee Shoemaker was born in the town of Fabens, Texas. At , Shoemaker was so small at birth that he was not expected to survive the night. Put in a shoebox on the oven to stay warm, he survived, but remained small, growing to and weighing . His diminutive size proved an asset in thoroughbred horse racing, of which he went on to become a giant, despite dropping out of El Monte High School in El Monte, California.

==Jockey career==
Shoemaker&#x27;s career as a jockey began in his teenage years, with his first professional ride on March 19, 1949. The first of his eventual 8,833 career victories came a month later, on April 20, aboard Shafter V, at Golden Gate Fields in Albany, California. In 1951, he won the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award.

At the age of 19, he was making so much money (as much as $2,500 each week) the Los Angeles Superior Court appointed attorney Horace Hahn as his guardian, with the consent of his parents.

Thirty years later, he won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey in the United States.
Shoemaker won eleven Triple Crown races during his career, spanning four different decades, but the Crown itself eluded him. The breakdown of these wins is as follows:
* Kentucky Derby: Swaps (1955), Tomy Lee (1959), Lucky Debonair (1965) and Ferdinand (1986)
* Preakness Stakes: Candy Spots (1963) and Damascus (1967)
* Belmont Stakes: Gallant Man (1957), Sword Dancer (1959), Jaipur (1962), Damascus (1967) and Avatar (1975)

Two of Shoemaker&#x27;s most noted rides were in the Kentucky Derby. He lost the 1957 Kentucky Derby aboard Gallant Man, when he stood up in the stirrups too soon, having misjudged the finish line. This caused Gallant Man to briefly lose his stride and slowed his rush for the wire, and he finished second to Iron Liege, ridden by Bill Hartack. At the 1986 Kentucky Derby, Shoemaker became the oldest jockey ever to win the race (at age 54) aboard the 18-1 outsider Ferdinand. The following year, he rode Ferdinand to a victory over Alysheba in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic; Ferdinand later captured Horse of the Year honors.

Shoemaker rode the popular California horse Silky Sullivan, about which he is quoted as saying: &quot;You just had to let him run his race ... and if he decided to win it, you&#x27;d better hold on because you&#x27;d be moving faster than a train.&quot;

When Shoemaker earned his 6,033rd victory in September 1970, he broke jockey Johnny Longden&#x27;s record. In 1999, Shoemaker&#x27;s own record of 8,833 career victories was broken by Panamanian-born Laffit Pincay Jr.; in 2006 Russell Baze tied Pincay&#x27;s record.

Win number 8,833, Shoemaker&#x27;s last, came at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Florida, on January 20, 1990, aboard Beau Genius. Two weeks later, on February 3, Shoemaker rode his last race on Patchy Groundfog, at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. He finished fourth, in front of a record crowd, to Eddie Delahoussaye, on Exemplary Leader. All told, Bill Shoemaker rode in a record 40,350 races. In 1990, he was voted the Mike Venezia Memorial Award for &quot;extraordinary sportsmanship and citizenship&quot;.

The Marlboro Cup of 1976 at Belmont Park proved to be maybe his greatest racing achievement, and it was upon the mighty Forego. Forego&#x27;s drive started from eighth position out of eleven horses on the backstretch. It culminated with a tremendous charge through the muddy middle-of-the-track stretch run, leading to a victory by a nose over the dead-game Honest Pleasure. Shoemaker was quoted as saying that Forego was the best horse he had ever ridden.

Shoemaker rode three-time champion Spectacular Bid in the horse&#x27;s final 13 races from 1979 to 1980 losing only once during that stretch. This included Spectacular Bid&#x27;s perfect nine for nine 1980 season, culminating in a walkover in the Woodward Stakes. In his autobiography &quot;Shoemaker&quot; (1988) he called Spectacular Bid the greatest horse he rode in his storied career.

==After 1990 jockey retirement==
Soon after retiring as a jockey in 1990, Shoemaker returned to the track as a trainer, where he had modest success, training for such clients as Gulfstream magnate Allen Paulson and composer Burt Bacharach.

He continued to train racehorses until his retirement on November 2, 1997. His final stats as a trainer were 90 wins from 714 starters and earnings of $3.7 million.

Shoemaker was involved in a solo drunk-driving car crash on April 8, 1991, in San Dimas, California, when he rolled over the Ford Bronco II he was driving. The accident left him paralyzed from the neck down, and he thereafter used a wheelchair. Even though a blood sample drawn 98 minutes after he entered the hospital showed his blood-alcohol at .13, above California&#x27;s legal limit of .08, Shoemaker did not accept blame for the crash. He sued the California Department of Transportation for not installing guard rails along the highway and Ford Motor Company for faulty vehicle design (as the Bronco II was infamous for it higher rollover risk). Ford settled with Shoemaker for $1,000,000.

Shoemaker authored three murder mysteries. They were often compared to the large stable of best-selling horse mysteries by fellow jockey/author Dick Francis. Shoemaker&#x27;s &quot;Stalking Horse&quot; (1994), &quot;Fire Horse&quot; (1995), and &quot;Dark Horse&quot; (1996) all featured jockey-turned-sleuth Coley Killebrew using his racetrack experience in and about his restaurant and the horse world.

Shoemaker died on October 12, 2003, of natural causes at his home in San Marino, California. He was 72 years old. He was survived by his adopted son and adopted daughter, Amanda.

==Honors==
Shoemaker was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1958. He was immortalized as part of a series of portraits by Andy Warhol in the mid-1970s.

<text>A megachurch is a church with a very large membership that also offers a variety of educational and social activities. Most megachurches are Protestant, and particularly Evangelical, although the word denotes a type of organization, not a denomination. The Hartford Institute for Religion Research defines a megachurch as any Protestant Christian church that draws 2,000 or more people in a weekend.

The first megachurch was established in London in 1861. More emerged in the 20th century, especially in the United States, and expanded rapidly through the 1980s and 1990s. In the 21st century, megachurches became widespread in the United States and a growing phenomenon in several African countries and Australia. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, they shifted away from traditional church architecture, with most newer ones having stadium-type seating.

== History ==

The origins of the megachurch movement, with many local congregants who returned on a weekly basis, can be traced to the 19th century. There were large churches earlier, but they were considerably rarer.

The first evangelical megachurch was founded in 1861 in London by Charles Spurgeon at the Metropolitan Tabernacle, which had a 6,000-seat auditorium.

The first megachurch in the United States was the Angelus Temple, founded in 1923 by Aimee Semple McPherson in a 5,300-seat auditorium in Los Angeles.

== Features ==
A megachurch has been defined by Hartford Institute for Religion Research (2006) and others as any Protestant Christian church which at least 2,000 attend in a weekend. The OED suggests that megachurches often include educational and social activities and are usually Protestant and Evangelical. These large congregations are a significant development in Protestant Christianity.

Most of these churches build their buildings in the suburbs of large cities, near major roads and highways, to be visible to as many people as possible and easily accessible by car. Some install a large cross as decoration for believers and to signal to potential new members.

A 2020 study by the Hartford Institute found that 70 percent of American megachurches had a multi-site network and an average of 7.6 services per weekend. The study also found that most U.S. megachurches are in Florida, Texas, California, and Georgia.

Churches that gather more than 10,000 people every Sunday have been dubbed &quot;gigachurches&quot;. In 2015, there were about 100 gigachurches in the United States. 

Several megachurch pastors also preach on television or radio programs, thereby also being televangelists. Aimee Semple McPherson was a pioneer of radio evangelism and a founder of an early megachurch. Robert Schuller, Oral Roberts, Jerry Falwell, Joel Osteen, and T. D. Jakes developed both megachurch and television audiences.

Megachurches are found in many countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, including Tanzania, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda. The largest church auditorium, The Glory Dome, was inaugurated in 2018 with 100,000 seats, in Abuja, Nigeria.

=== America ===

In 2010, the Hartford Institute&#x27;s database listed more than 1,300 megachurches in the United States. About 50 churches on the list had average attendance exceeding 10,000, and one had 47,000. On one weekend in November 2015, around one in ten Protestant churchgoers in the U.S.—about 5 million people—attended service in a megachurch. Some 3,000 individual Catholic Church parishes have 2,000 or more attendants for an average Sunday Mass, but they are not called megachurches as that is a Protestant term.

In the United States, the phenomenon has more than quadrupled in the two decades to 2017.

=== Asia ===
In 2007, five of the ten largest Protestant churches were in South Korea. In 2007, the largest megachurch in the world by attendance was South Korea&#x27;s Yoido Full Gospel Church, an Assemblies of God (Pentecostal) church, with more than 830,000 members.

Graha Bethany Nginden, is a megachurch which is one of the largest churches in Surabaya, Indonesia and Southeast Asia. The Church is affiliated with Bethany Indonesian Church.

=== Australia ===
Australian scholar Sam Hey wrote in 2011 that &quot;almost all megachurch developments are Pentecostal, or charismatic and neo-Pentecostal offshoots&quot;.

One of the first megachurches in Australia was the Christian Outreach Centre (COC), now the International Network of Churches.

Hillsong Church was founded in 1983 in Sydney, New South Wales, out of two Christian Life Centre churches and has since planted churches all around Australia and the world. Another significant Australian international Pentecostal network is the C3 Global Network, founded in 1980.

== Criticism ==
In 2005, Baptist Pastor Al Sharpton criticized megachurches for focusing on &quot;bedroom morals&quot;, statements against same-sex marriage and abortion, by ignoring issues of social justice, such as the immorality of war and the erosion of affirmative action.

A study by the Hartford Institute published in 2020 found that 60 percent of American megachurches were members of a Christian denomination. In 2018, American professor Scot McKnight of Northern Baptist Theological Seminary criticized nondenominational megachurches for the weak external accountability relationship of their leaders, by not being members of a Christian denomination, further exposing them to abuse of power.

Some megachurches and their pastors have been accused by critics of promoting prosperity theology, where the poor and vulnerable are encouraged to donate their money to the church rather than saving it, in the hopes that God will bless them with wealth. This in turn increases the wealth of the pastors, with some revealed to wear designer clothing during sermons and own luxury vehicles.
