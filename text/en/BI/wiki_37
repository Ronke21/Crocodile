<text>Piper Halliwell is a fictional character from the American television series &quot;Charmed&quot;, played by Holly Marie Combs from October 7, 1998, until May 21, 2006. The character was created by Constance M. Burge, who based Piper on her second-oldest sister. Piper is introduced into the series as the middle sister to Prue (Shannen Doherty) and Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano). She is one of the original featured leads and, more specifically, a Charmed Oneone of the most powerful witches of all time. Piper&#x27;s power was initially described as the ability to stop time in her surrounding environment. As the series progresses, Leo reveals that her power actually works by slowing down molecules to the point that they stop. She also receives the power to cause evil beings or objects to explode using her hands, by instead speeding up molecules to the point of combustion.

During the first three seasons, Piper is portrayed as the &quot;sweet&quot;, &quot;sensitive middle sister&quot;, and peacemaker of the group as she often attempts to keep the peace between her two sisters. She later develops a more aggressive and protective personality when she becomes the eldest sister from season four onwards, following Prue&#x27;s death and the introduction of their younger half-sister Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan). Piper&#x27;s storylines have often revolved around her protecting innocents and defeating the forces of evil in San Francisco with her sisters, as well as leading a normal life as a chef for a restaurant and later as the owner of a nightclub. Piper&#x27;s central love interest throughout the series is Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause), the sisters&#x27; Whitelightera guardian angel for good witches. After the pair temporarily split in season two, a love triangle forms between Piper, Leo, and her neighbor Dan Gordon (Greg Vaughan). Piper and Leo eventually marry in season three, and later have a son named Wyatt in season five. They separate again at the end of season five, and Piper starts dating other men in the subsequent season. However, Piper and Leo reconnect towards the end of season six, resulting in a second son named Chris.

The character received a positive reception from television critics, who praised Combs&#x27; performance as Piper and her relationship with Leo. Combs garnered various awards and nominations for her portrayal of Piper. In 2007 and 2008, AOL TV ranked Piper third on their list of the Top TV Witches, behind Samantha Stephens from &quot;Bewitched&quot; and Willow Rosenberg from &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. She was ranked sixth on both E! Online&#x27;s 2011 list of the &quot;Top 10 Most Bitchin&#x27; Witches&quot;, and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;″s 2016 list of &quot;The Top 10 Greatest Witches of All Time&quot;. In addition to the television series, the character has also appeared in numerous expanded universe material, such as the &quot;Charmed&quot; novels and its comic book adaptation.

==Casting and development==
In 1998, The WB began searching for a drama series, and looked to Spelling Television, which had produced the network&#x27;s most successful series &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, to create it. Expanding on the popularity of supernatural-themed dramas, the production company explored forms of mythology to find mythological characters they could focus on with contemporary storytelling. In order to create the series, Constance M. Burge was hired as the creator as she was under contract with 20th Century Fox and Spelling Television after conceiving the drama &quot;Savannah&quot;.

The character of Piper Halliwell was conceived by Burge, who wrote the pilot script for &quot;Charmed&quot;. The pilot script was based around three mismatched sisters who are initially based on Burge and her two older sisters, Laura and Edie Burge. Piper is based on Burge&#x27;s second-oldest sister Edie. On creating Piper, Burge stated &quot;The middle sibling typically tends to be a real people pleaser and very funny, tends to deal with life with a lot of humour. That really applied to my sister, Edie and so I could see the character of Piper [through her].&quot; Executive producer Brad Kern stated that Piper was written into the series as &quot;the middle sister just trying to keep the peace, trying to find love, trying to find her career, and trying to keep Prue and Phoebe from killing each other.&quot;

When the series was in its first development stages, executive producer Aaron Spelling had always known who he wanted for the role of Prue, Shannen Doherty, an actress from a previous Spelling Television series, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Doherty already devoted to the project pitched the idea of her best friend for the role of Piper Halliwell, former &quot;Picket Fences&quot; actress Holly Marie Combs. Doherty played the role of Prue in a 28-minute test pilot (the &quot;unaired pilot&quot;, never aired on television) alongside Combs and actress Lori Rom who played the youngest sister Phoebe Halliwell. Rom quit the series and a new pilot was filmed with former &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss&quot; actress Alyssa Milano, who took over the role of Phoebe.

==Appearances==

===Television===

Piper is the second eldest Halliwell sister and is portrayed by Holly Marie Combs in all of the show&#x27;s aired 178 episodes as well as the unaired pilot, making Combs the only cast member to appear in the complete series and the first pilot. At the start of season one (1998–99), six months have passed since the death of her Grams, Penny Halliwell (Jennifer Rhodes). Piper having already moved back into her family&#x27;s Victorian Manor with her eldest sister Prue (Shannen Doherty), is later joined by their youngest sister Phoebe (Alyssa Milano). On the night of Phoebe&#x27;s return, she finds a book called the &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; within the Manor&#x27;s attic. After Phoebe unknowingly recites aloud what turns out to be an incantation from the book, the three sisters each receive a magical power and discover their destiny as The Charmed Ones – the most powerful good witches the world has ever known. Initially Piper receives the power to &quot;freeze&quot; her surrounding environment, beginning as she freezes her chef boss in a timed situation. A major plot for the first episode of the series focuses on Piper realizing that her boyfriend, Jeremy (Eric Scott Woods), is a warlock, when he seizes upon the opportunity to kill her for her powers, forcing Piper and her sisters to vanquish him. Due to her role as the middle sister, Piper is often regarded as the peacemaker of the group as she often attempts to keep the peace between the headstrong Prue and free-spirited Phoebe. During this season, Piper works at the restaurant Quake as a chef and later as its manager. She develops an on-again off-again relationship with the handy-man Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause) who she later discovers to be her whitelighter – a guardian angel for good witches.

In the second season (1999–2000), Piper has quit her job at Quake and has ventured into running her own business in the form of the nightclub P3. After her split with Leo, due to the strenuous nature his Whitelighter duties place on their romantic relationship, Piper begins to date her neighbor Dan Gordon (Greg Vaughan) in an attempt at a normal relationship. This causes major conflict as Leo and Piper retain lingering feelings for one another resulting in a love triangle between the three characters. As Piper hones her skills as a witch and a business owner, she eventually comes to the conclusion that despite her love for Dan, her heart will always belong to Leo. Piper later breaks up with Dan and reconciles with Leo. In the season two finale, Piper and her sisters discover that the many attacks on their lives by evil beings have been orchestrated by a demonic force known as The Council. Piper also desires to learn more about Leo&#x27;s life as a whitelighter and asks him to take her to meet The Elders, senior whitelighters who act as the authoritative council for all of good magic. The couple are last seen orbing off to The Elders&#x27; heavenly realm.

In season three (2000–01), after being detained &quot;Up There&quot; for a month, Piper and Leo are told by The Elders to end their relationship or Leo will no longer be the sisters&#x27; whitelighter. Leo subsequently proposes marriage to Piper claiming that once married The Elders will not have the power to break them apart. Leo and Piper attempt to wed in secret during a solar eclipse, a phenomenon which prevents those &quot;Up There&quot; from looking down on Earth, but are caught in the act when The Elders are informed of the wedding by The Triad (who have replaced The Council), who in turn learned of the wedding through their demonic spy Cole Turner (Julian McMahon). Leo is taken into captivity by The Elders as punishment for breaking their rules and Piper is left heartbroken. After Piper makes the choice to continue to protect innocents despite losing Leo, The Elders return Leo to Earth. The Elders allow the couple to prove that their relationship will not interfere with their greater calling. Leo and Piper are finally allowed to wed in mid-season three. Piper and her sisters eventually learn that The Triad work for an even greater evil, The Source of All Evil who is the leader of the demonic realm known as The Underworld. Before the season&#x27;s end, Piper acquires her second magical ability, the power to cause explosions. During the season three finale, Prue and Piper unwittingly expose themselves as witches to the world after being caught on camera by a local news crew fighting with The Source&#x27;s personal assassin Shax. In the aftermath of the exposure, Piper is shot by a crazed Wiccan fanatic who wanted to join the sisters&#x27; coven and dies in the arms of Prue. In order to save her sister&#x27;s life, Prue orders Leo to find Phoebe and pass on a deal to The Source to turn back time. This would reset the exposure of magic and save Piper&#x27;s life. The Source agrees, knowing that he plans to double cross her in the end as Phoebe will be immune to the time reset while in The Underworld. In the end Phoebe will not be able to warn her sisters&#x27; of the assassin attack and he will kill her himself. Time is reversed to the sisters&#x27; first encounter with Shax, however Phoebe no longer answers when Prue calls for help, as she was never sent back. The season ends on a cliffhanger with Piper and Prue left for dead after losing in the fight against Shax. Meanwhile, Phoebe remains trapped in The Underworld.

In the opening episode of the fourth season (2001–02), &quot;Charmed Again (Part 1)&quot;, it is revealed Piper has been healed of her injuries from the season three finale and Prue was unable to be saved. Piper attempts numerous spells to resurrect Prue to no avail, and when she comes into contact with her Grams, it is revealed that Prue is still struggling to adjust to being in the afterlife and that she is being helped to process her actual death by both Penny and the girls&#x27; mother Patty Halliwell (Finola Hughes). Penny also reveals to Piper that Prue cannot be summoned back to Earth because seeing Prue would not allow the sisters to grieve and move on to continue their destiny. This leads to Piper being broken and outraged towards everyone around her, especially to Leo which she states &quot;saved the wrong sister&quot;. Finally accepting Prue is really gone, she attends the funeral of her big sister. This results in Phoebe having a premonition to save a young girl at the funeral and later discovering her identity as their younger half-sister Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan). A love child between their mother and her whitelighter, who was kept secret because of her whitelighter heritage. Piper struggles to accept the new sister and role of the now eldest sibling as she and Paige initially butt heads, but eventually grow to have a mutual respect for each other. With the addition of Paige, Piper and Phoebe are able to reconstitute the Power of Three and avenge Prue&#x27;s death in vanquishing her murderer Shax and The Source himself twice – both in his original incarnation and that of his next incarnation, Cole. The sisters are later visited by the Angel of Destiny (Dakin Matthews) and given an offer to live a normal life without magical powers or the threat of demons. After Piper declines alongside her sisters, the Angel informs her that she is pregnant with her first child.

In season five (2002–03), the powers of her unborn child makes Piper indestructible. Initially, the baby makes her self-healing, and later protects her with a force field. When the child is born, to everyone&#x27;s surprise, a boy—in a trip to the future she had only seen a daughter—Piper names him Wyatt Matthew Halliwell. Piper&#x27;s son is discovered to be The Twice-Blessed Child, the most powerful magical being of all time, which attracts even more demons into the sisters&#x27; lives. In the fifth-season finale, a whitelighter from the future named Chris (Drew Fuller) arrives to assist the sisters against the ancient Titans of mythology. After the Elders are forced into hiding by the Titans, Chris manipulates events so that Leo has to become an Elder, causing him to separate from Piper. Piper is so angry that she initially refuses to give up her temporary powers (those of Demeter, Goddess of Earth), though Leo uses his newfound powers to artificially alleviate her pain.

In season six (2003–04), Piper again clings to goddess powers when she finds temporarily becoming a valkyrie a better alternative than living with the pain of Leo leaving her. Her sisters use a spell to bring back Piper&#x27;s feelings of loss. She begins to recover from her separation from Leo and date again, though Chris (in reality, Piper&#x27;s second son from the future) tries to stop this from happening. Chris is able to temporarily reunite Piper and Leo in the episode &quot;The Courtship of Wyatt&#x27;s Father&quot; in order to ensure his conception. After gaining the sisters&#x27; trust, Chris informs them that his true mission is to prevent Wyatt from growing up to be the evil dictator he becomes in the future. Unlike her pregnancy with Wyatt, the pregnancy with Chris offers Piper no protection and she is forced to relocate to Magic School, with Wyatt, for her own protection. The Elder Gideon (Gildart Jackson), also headmaster of Magic School, attempts to kill baby Wyatt in order to prevent this future but is killed by Leo in the season six finale, the same episode in which future Chris dies and present-day Chris is born.

Season seven (2004–05) starts with Piper and Leo attending two Indian friends&#x27; wedding, where they are possessed by the spirits of two passing Hindu deities, Shakti and Shiva. Piper uses these powers to defend herself from demons dispatched to kill her by old enemy Barbas (Billy Drago). In the episode &quot;Someone to Witch Over Me&quot;, Leo concedes to the offer of membership extended by The Avatars (powerful neutral beings who seek to create a Utopian reality). He informs Piper of his decision in the episode &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Leo&quot; and later urges the sisters to join sides with The Avatars in their plan to turn the world into a utopia against the warnings of Paige&#x27;s boyfriend Kyle Brody (Kerr Smith) and The Elders. Realising the Utopia robs people of their free will, Leo sacrifices himself. Piper realises her children&#x27;s pain over their father&#x27;s loss and allies with The Underworld&#x27;s new leader, Zankou (Oded Fehr), to force The Avatars to rewind time to before the change took place. Leo later chooses to return to Piper in the 150th episode, &quot;The Seven Year Witch&quot;, at the expense of his magical abilities, becoming mortal. Piper and Leo encounter evil Future Wyatt (Wes Ramsey) for themselves in the episode &quot;Imaginary Fiends&quot;, but are able to stop the last impediment to his becoming a power for good. In the season seven finale, the sisters are forced to fake their deaths after they destroy Zankou and escape the constant threat of demon attacks, as well as police and government investigations.

The eighth and final season (2005–06) begins with the sisters assuming new identities (those of their fictitious cousins), with Piper assuming the identity of Jenny Bennett (Beatrice Rosen) and later Jamie Bennett (Regan Nicole Wallake). The sisters also take on neophyte witch Billie Jenkins (Kaley Cuoco) to do some of their magical legwork for them when she discovers who they really are. They later resume their real identities in the episode &quot;Rewitched&quot; with the help of federal agent Murphy (Brandon Quinn) in exchange for helping the FBI handle supernatural investigations. An Angel of Destiny (Denise Dowse) seizes Leo in the episode &quot;Vaya Con Leos&quot; to motivate Piper against their final threat as Charmed Ones. This turns out to be Billie and her sister, Christy (Marnette Patterson), who believe the sisters have stopped using their powers for good. In the penultimate episode, &quot;Kill Billie, Vol. 2&quot;, the two sets of sisters undertake an all-out battle, which destroys the Halliwell Manor, and only Piper and Billie survive. In the series finale, &quot;Forever Charmed&quot;, Piper uses cupid Coop&#x27;s (Victor Webster) time-traveling ring to call upon her mother and grandmother and save the lives of her sisters. After Christy is defeated, Piper and her sisters write about their lives in the Book of Shadows. An epilogue depicts Piper with her three children including the addition of a daughter who she calls Melinda, and then living to old age (played by Ellen Geer) and being surrounded by children and grandchildren.

===Literature===

As one of the central characters throughout the entire series, Piper appears in the majority of &quot;Charmed&quot; literature. These appearances first began in the series of novels. The novels follow no strict continuity with the series or each other, and are often considered to be non-canon. However, the television series producers have final approval of everything in the novels, which could indicate the literature fitting into the established canon of the series and the so-called &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot; universe&quot;. Piper&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Charmed&quot; literature takes place within the novel &quot;The Power of Three&quot; by Eliza Willard on November 1, 1999, which acts as a novelised version of the series premiere episode. Her last appearance in a &quot;Charmed&quot; novel takes place within &quot;Trickery Treat&quot; by Diana G. Gallagher on January 1, 2008.

In 2010, &quot;Charmed&quot; gained an officially licensed continuation in the form of a comic book, which is often billed as &quot;&quot;. The series is published monthly by Zenescope Entertainment. Set eighteen-months after the series finale, the sisters are seen living happy demon free lives and have each entered into motherhood. Piper has had a third child, a girl named Prudence Melinda and is planning on opening her own restaurant. In Issue #4, &quot;Mortal Enemies&quot;, Piper develops a new power in the form of distorting the molecules of objects when she melts the ground to trap the resurrected Source of All Evil.

==Powers and abilities==

===Magical powers===
In &quot;Charmed&quot; it is revealed that magical witches can develop and master a variety of magical skills and powers which include scrying, spell casting, and brewing potent potions. As a magical witch Piper can utilize scrying, a divination art form that allows one to locate a missing object or person. Piper can also cast spells, often written in iambic pentameter or as a rhyming couplet, to influence others or the world around her. She can also brew potions, most often used to vanquish foes or to achieve other magical feats similar to the effects of a spell. As a witch and Charmed One, Piper has also developed a number of magical powers which include molecular immobilization and molecular combustion.

====Molecular Immobilization====
As Piper first comes into her powers, the first power she develops is the ability to slow down molecular motion so that objects, people, and even energy discharges instantly freeze in place. In the &quot;Charmed&quot; series, certain magical powers are attached to emotional triggers, although all powers can be affected by the user&#x27;s emotions. For Piper, the emotional trigger for her freezing power is panic induced situations which enact a fear response. At first Piper would freeze everything in the immediate area whenever startled. Gradually, Piper learned to control this ability and freeze everything in the immediate area by a conscious act of will and gesturing. She must be able to gesture to activate her freezing power and cannot do so without using her hands. Piper also learns to selectively freeze specific objects of her choosing, rather than everything in the entire area. She can even specify a particular type of entity to be frozen, as shown in Season 3, episode 1 (&quot;The Honeymoon&#x27;s Over&quot;) when she intentionally caused only the innocents to freeze in a courtroom, even without knowing which beings present were innocents and which were demons. When Piper was new to her powers, objects she froze would eventually regain their mobility on their own, usually after several seconds. She later learns to unfreeze at will, even freezing an entire object, then unfreezing only part of it. This can be seen in the season three episode &quot;Sleuthing with the Enemy&quot;, at which point Piper freezes a Zohtar demon named Krell (Scott MacDonald) in midair, then unfreezes his head in order to interrogate him. In the second season episode, &quot;Astral Monkey&quot;, Piper revealed that she could keep an object frozen as long as she focused, such as when she kept a metal disc thrown by a telekinetic Dr. Curtis Williamson frozen. As her powers developed, Piper was able to disrupt an object&#x27;s momentum, as seen in the season four episode &quot;Saving Private Leo&quot;, when she caused a dagger thrown at her to fall to the floor after she unfroze it instead of it resuming its original trajectory.

The mass of an object seems to be no restriction on her power. Instead, the limitation of her freezing power appears to be determined by the size of the area, and she can freeze anything (except those entities immune to her powers) in the area of effect. The exact limitation has never been determined. Indoors, however, Piper is limited by the room she is in. She can freeze objects in the same room and cannot freeze anything outside the room, unless she has an unobstructed path to those objects, such as through an open door or window. Piper&#x27;s freeze could be broken with enough physical stimulus, and it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to unfreeze somebody affected by this power; for example, Paige managed to unfreeze Leo by nudging his shoulder in &quot;Long Live the Queen.&quot; Her grandmother, Penny, could also seemingly telekinetically unfreeze someone without necessarily moving them (possibly by telekinetically stimulating the frozen target&#x27;s molecules), as seen in &quot;That &#x27;70s Episode.&quot; In &quot;A Witch In Time,&quot; the warlock Bacarra unfroze a knife in midair by incanting &quot;glacies imber,&quot; thereby causing the knife to resume its trajectory. During the first season in &quot;Feats of Clay,&quot; Piper herself admitted that continuous use of her freezing power in rapid succession was draining and could leave her exhausted. Certain entities have proven resistant or immune to her freezing ability, such as morally ambiguous witches, ghosts, furies, and certain demons and warlocks. However, as the series progresses, less and less enemies are immune to her power as it grows to the point that even the Triad, very powerful upper-level demons are frozen by it during the Charmed Ones final confrontation with their physical selves. Notably, unlike how one proved vulnerable to her combustion power, this was while the Triad was still at full power though they were seen to be starting to unfreeze before Piper unfroze them herself.

In the season two episode, &quot;Morality Bites&quot;, Piper travels ten years into the future from the year 1999 and inhabits her future self&#x27;s body. In the episode, Piper discovers that in ten years time, her freezing power becomes ten times stronger allowing her to instantly freeze an entire city block. After returning to the present, Piper never realizes the growth of this level of power before the series comes to an end.

====Molecular Combustion====

In late season three, Piper gains the ability to cause objects or evil beings to spontaneously explode using her hands. As explained by Leo in the episode &quot;Exit Strategy&quot;, &quot;[Piper&#x27;s] powers work by slowing down molecules, and apparently now [she] can speed them up as well.&quot; Unlike her freezing power, this new ability is triggered by anger and frustration, but is also controllable by conscious act of will and hand gestures. She also proves able to cause magical energy discharges and even living entities to explode. However, the limitations on her explosive power are even less clear than those of her freezing ability, but appear to be determined by an object&#x27;s size and durability. The largest object she ever caused to explode was a truck door entrance to a warehouse. It once took her four tries to break down a much smaller gate, although this object was magically reinforced. Apparently, Piper doesn&#x27;t have to be directly in front of an object to blow it up, she just has to see it or know exactly were the object is. However, she has to aim her hands at her target in order for it to explode and has the potential of missing it, similar to throwing a projectile. For example, in the season four episode &quot;Long Live the Queen,&quot; Phoebe pushed Piper&#x27;s arms when she attempted to blast the demon Malick and she instead blew up a bicycle. Similarly, in the season seven episode &quot;Witchness Protection,&quot; Leo pushed Piper away from blowing up Kyra and her hands missed the target, blowing up a picture instead. Although Piper needs to use her hands to use her exploding power, her heightened emotional state during the Blue Moon allowed her to blow things up without any hand gestures or even looking at her target. Over the course of the series, Piper&#x27;s power grows to the point that even the most powerful demons are affected by it; she is able to vanquish Jeric, an Egyptian demon so powerful that in the past his enemies were only able to mummify him. She was also able to vanquish one of The Triad, three very powerful demons who had no known way of vanquishing them with just three hits from the power, albeit after he was weakened by the vanquish of one of his comrades. In later seasons, she also displayed the ability to deflect enemy attacks back at them in a similar way to telekinesis.

In the &quot;Charmed&quot; comics, specifically in Issue #4, &quot;Mortal Enemies&quot;, Piper&#x27;s power evolves such that, short of blowing objects up, she can reverberate their molecules at a speed which causes them to become disordered, resulting in either melting or burning. Heat and fire can be created with the power also, as seen in Issue #9, &quot;The All or Nothing&quot;.

===Natural abilities===
Piper is proven to be a skilled chef, a talent which lends itself to her potion-making. While Piper has shown some gymnastic and athletic ability, unlike her sisters Phoebe and Prue, Piper has never pursued martial arts and is not particularly adept at physical combat, instead preferring to use active powers. But as the series continued and Piper takes a more leadership role, following Prue&#x27;s death, her combative skills increased somewhat.

==Reception==
In 2001, Combs was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Science Fiction Series at the RATTY Awards for her portrayal of Piper. She was nominated for Best Science Fiction Lead Actress at the same awards ceremony in 2002 and won that category in 2003.

In his review of the first season, Terry Kelleher of &quot;People&quot; magazine described Piper as &quot;the sweet one&quot; out of the three Halliwell sisters. &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Michael Abernethy wrote that Combs was &quot;the most enjoyable to watch&quot; and noted that her character Piper played &quot;the role of compassionate mediator between her two sisters&quot; in &quot;Charmed&quot;″s first three seasons. While reviewing the first season, Brett Cullum of DVD Verdict wrote, &quot;Piper is the most sensitive middle sister who seems to bridge the gap between the oldest and youngest—the diplomat. She could handle the drama handily, and anchored the show with her acting chops and Neve Campbell-esque brunette good looks.&quot; A writer for Film.com described Piper as &quot;the moral compass and voice of reason for the &#x27;Charmed Ones&#x27;.&quot; Rachel Day of &quot;Geek Speak&quot; magazine praised Combs&#x27; acting on &quot;Charmed&quot;, noting that the scenes of Piper grieving over the loss of Prue in the season four episode &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot; was &quot;superbly done&quot; and showcased her &quot;anger and pain at Pru[e]&#x27;s death.&quot; Day also praised Piper and Leo&#x27;s relationship as &quot;the most successful depiction&quot; throughout the series. She wrote, &quot;The relationship traveled the course from forbidden love to marriage to separation to reconciliation and a happy ending. Personally, a lot of the charm about &quot;Charmed&quot; for me was the way the show really showcased this relationship with all its up and downs.&quot;

CNN&#x27;s Joshua Levs called Piper &quot;the show&#x27;s solid foundation&quot; and commended the writers for making Piper and Leo&#x27;s relationship &quot;interesting throughout the entire run by throwing in major wrenches left and right. I can&#x27;t think of another series that&#x27;s pulled that off.&quot; In reviewing the fourth season, Leigh H. Edwards of &quot;PopMatters&quot; felt that Piper and Leo provided &quot;engaging, often funny material&quot; when they were &quot;navigating the equally momentous shoals of domesticity.&quot; Gillian Flynn of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented that when it came to the comedy moments in the sixth season, Combs&#x27; acting was the best one out of the show&#x27;s three lead actresses. Flynn described Piper as a &quot;pert little mother&quot; and &quot;purse-lipped precision underplayer.&quot; In his mixed review of the eighth and final season, DVD Verdict&#x27;s Ryan Keefer praised Piper&#x27;s &quot;incredibly emotional goodbye to Leo&quot; in the episode &quot;Vaya Con Leos&quot; and felt that she was &quot;the saving grace for this season.&quot;

==Cultural impact==
In 2007, Piper was ranked third on AOL TV&#x27;s list of Top TV Witches, behind Samantha Stephens from &quot;Bewitched&quot; and Willow Rosenberg from &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. She also ranked third on the same list the following year. In 2011, E! Online ranked Piper at number six on their list of the Top 10 Most Bitchin&#x27; Witches, writing &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be evil to be bitchin&#x27;. Not only does Holly Marie Combs&#x27; witch possess...the ability to freeze time and to make objects spontaneously explode, but Piper is driven by the desire to protect her family and won&#x27;t let anything get in her way.&quot; In 2016, Piper was also ranked sixth in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;″s list of &quot;The Top 10 Greatest Witches of All Time&quot;, adding that &quot;Piper is the true MVP of the Charmed Ones; over eight years she stepped into the role of family matriarch and proved that witches really can have it all, becoming a wife, mother and successful businesswoman, but never forgetting that sisterhood is everything.&quot;

Both the show and character were referenced in the episode &quot;Sorry for Your Loss&quot; of the sci-fi series &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, when Piper Nichols (Aeriél Miranda) introduces herself to Russell Kwon (Aaron Yoo), and he responds by saying &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot;, Piper&quot; In his review of the television series &quot;Witches of East End&quot; being too similar to &quot;Charmed&quot;, Christian Cintron of Hollywood.com noted that Rachel Boston&#x27;s &quot;high-strung but well meaning&quot; character Ingrid Beauchamp &quot;could be a carbon-copy of Piper.&quot;

<doc id="345218" wikidata="Q1639574" url="?curid=345218" title="Phoebe Halliwell">
<text>Phoebe Halliwell is a fictional character from the American television series &quot;Charmed&quot;, played by Alyssa Milano from October 7, 1998, until May 21, 2006. The character was originally played by Lori Rom in the unaired pilot episode. However, Rom quit the series, and a new pilot was filmed with Milano in the role of Phoebe. The character was created by Constance M. Burge and is based on Burge herself. Phoebe is introduced into &quot;Charmed&quot; as the youngest sister to Prue (Shannen Doherty) and Piper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs). She is one of the original featured leads and, more specifically, a Charmed Oneone of the most powerful witches of all time. Phoebe initially possesses the power of , which enables her to see into the future and the past. To make up for initially only having a passive power, Phoebe develops martial arts skills in order to better assist her sisters when they fight evil beings. As the series progresses, she also gains the active powers of levitation and empathy.

Phoebe was originally portrayed as the &quot;free-spirited&quot;, &quot;carefree&quot;, and most rebellious sister. However, Phoebe&#x27;s progression as a witch helps her become more responsible and grow as a person. She later becomes the middle sister from season four onwards, after Prue dies and the series introduces their younger half-sister Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan). Phoebe&#x27;s various romantic relationships have been central to most of her storylines. Her longest on-screen relationship is with half-demon Cole Turner (Julian McMahon); they have a turbulent marriage in the fourth season, and in the fifth, following their divorce, she is compelled to vanquish him. In subsequent seasons, Phoebe has romantic relationships with her boss Jason Dean (Eric Dane), coworker Leslie St. Claire (Nick Lachey), and artist Dex Lawson (Jason Lewis). In the eighth and final season, she marries a cupid named Coop (Victor Webster).

The character was mostly well received by television critics, who praised Phoebe&#x27;s comedic side and felt that Milano was a better fit for the role than Rom. They also commented on the outfits worn by Phoebe in the later seasons, with some critics describing them as &quot;revealing and ridiculous costumes&quot;, &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;skimpy.&quot; Milano&#x27;s portrayal of Phoebe earned her several awards and nominations; she was nominated for a Spacey Award, Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Award, and a Teen Choice Award. In 2007 and 2008, AOL TV ranked Phoebe at number seven on their list of the Top TV Witches. In addition to the television series, the character has also appeared in numerous expanded universe material, such as the &quot;Charmed&quot; novels and its comic book adaptation.

==Casting and development==
In 1998, The WB began searching for a drama series, and looked to Spelling Television, which had produced the network&#x27;s most successful series &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, to create it. Expanding on the popularity of supernatural-themed dramas, the production company explored forms of mythology to find mythological characters they could focus on with contemporary storytelling. In order to create the series, Constance M. Burge was hired as the creator as she was under contract with 20th Century Fox and Spelling Television after conceiving the drama &quot;Savannah&quot;.

The character of Phoebe Halliwell was conceived by Burge, who wrote the pilot script for &quot;Charmed&quot;. The pilot script was based around three mismatched sisters who are initially based on Burge and her two older sisters, Laura and Edie Burge. Phoebe is based on Burge herself. On creating the Halliwell sisters, Burge stated &quot;Phoebe was honestly the easiest. It just grew from within.&quot; Executive producer Brad Kern claimed Phoebe was written into the series as the classic younger sibling and stated that at the start of series Phoebe is &quot;trying to find her own identity by living life large and not really having a care in the world.&quot;

When the series was in its first development stages, actress Lori Rom was cast in the role of Phoebe. Rom played the role in a 28-minute test pilot (the &quot;unaired pilot&quot; never aired on television) with which the series was picked up by The WB. Rom later pulled out from the series before a 45-minute version of the pilot could be filmed for proper network television, leaving the role of Phoebe vacant. Executive producer Aaron Spelling then turned to actress Alyssa Milano, who was previously cast in another television series produced by Spelling Television, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. While Milano was in Hawaii shooting an episode for &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, Spelling phoned Milano and asked her to consider joining the series. After receiving a copy of the original pilot and the script, five days later Milano began shooting the re-shot pilot episode.

==Appearances==

===Television===
====Season 1====
Phoebe enters the series as the youngest Halliwell sister. She was first portrayed by Lori Rom in the unaired pilot, which the role was later given and portrayed by Alyssa Milano in all of the show&#x27;s aired 178 episodes. At the start of season one (1998–99), six months have passed since the death of her Grams, Penny Halliwell (Jennifer Rhodes). A jobless Phoebe returns from New York City and moves back to San Francisco into her family&#x27;s Victorian Manor with her two sisters Prue (Shannen Doherty) and Piper (Holly Marie Combs). On the night of Phoebe&#x27;s return, she finds a book called the &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; within the Manor&#x27;s attic. After Phoebe unknowingly recites aloud what turns out to be an incantation from the book, the three sisters each receive a magical power and discover their destiny as The Charmed Ones – the most powerful good witches the world has ever known. Phoebe obtains the power to &quot;see the future&quot; which contrasts with her known reckless persona. Because of her free-spirited nature, Phoebe often brings conflict into the Halliwell Manor, more often with Prue during the first season — this is especially in regards to their witchcraft. Initially drawn apart due to Prue&#x27;s speculation of Phoebe being the cause of her failed engagement to Roger (Matthew Ashford), the two sisters mend their relationship over the course of the season.

====Season 2====
In season two (1999–2000), Phoebe is seen re-entering college and majoring in psychology. She continues to embrace her destiny as a witch and is noted by her sisters as being the best at writing new spells. In the absence of an active power, Phoebe becomes progressively adept at martial arts in order to better fight demons and warlocks. Throughout the season, Phoebe struggles to open herself up to love and attempts to find a love interest who can live up to her &quot;ideal guy&quot; as portrayed in her favorite in-verse movie, &quot;Kill It Before It Dies&quot; by the character Billy (Chris Payne Gilbert). In the season two finale, Phoebe and her sisters discover that the many attacks on their lives by evil beings have been orchestrated by a demonic force known as The Council.

====Season 3====
In the show&#x27;s third season (2000–01), Phoebe receives the active power of levitation and enters a relationship with Cole Turner (Julian McMahon), who is actually the demon mercenary Belthazor that was sent by The Triad (who have replaced The Council) to kill The Charmed Ones. Upon this discovery, Phoebe struggles between her loyalty to her sisters and her love for Cole. After a tumultuous love affair, often deterred due to Cole&#x27;s frequent struggle between good and evil, Phoebe manages to graduate from college. Phoebe and her sisters eventually learn that The Triad work for an even greater evil, The Source of All Evil who is the leader of the demonic realm known as The Underworld. In the season three finale, Phoebe ventures into The Underworld to save Cole from his dark side, while her sisters face dire consequences in the world above. Prue and Piper unwittingly expose themselves as witches to the world after being caught on camera by a local news crew fighting with The Source&#x27;s personal assassin Shax. This results in Piper&#x27;s catastrophic death in the arms of Prue, and Phoebe unable to help them. In order to save Piper&#x27;s life, Prue orders Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause) to find Phoebe and pass on a deal to The Source to turn back time. The Source agrees, knowing that he plans to double cross her in the end as Phoebe will be immune to the time reset while in The Underworld. Time is reversed to the sisters&#x27; first encounter with Shax, however Phoebe no longer answers when Prue calls for help, as she was never sent back. The season ends on a cliffhanger with Piper and Prue left for dead after losing in the fight against Shax. Meanwhile, Phoebe remains trapped in The Underworld.

====Season 4====
The opening episode of the fourth season (2001–02), &quot;Charmed Again (Part 1)&quot;, reveals that Phoebe was rescued from The Underworld by Leo and Cole. However, because of this they arrived too late and were only able to heal Piper of her injuries from the season three finale. Prue&#x27;s injuries from Shax were too severe and was unable to be saved. Later in the episode, while attending Prue&#x27;s funeral, Phoebe meets Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan) and receives a premonition of the woman being attacked by Shax. This incident leads to Phoebe and Piper discovering that Paige is their younger half-sister. By the end of the season premiere, Paige helps to restore the Power of Three and avenge Prue&#x27;s death in vanquishing her murderer Shax. During this season, Phoebe finds herself forced into the role of the middle sister as she attempts to play mediator between Piper and Paige, much like Piper was once for her and Prue. Alongside continuing her Charmed role, Phoebe receives a marriage proposal from Cole, accepting after he becomes stripped of his demon half. Phoebe eventually pens the spell to vanquish The Source, whom escapes a final vanquish by possessing the now human Cole. For the remainder of the season, Phoebe plans to marry Cole unaware that he has become the new Source of All Evil and ruler of The Underworld. After being tricked by Cole and The Seer (Debbie Morgan) into participating in a dark marriage ceremony, Phoebe lands a job as an advice columnist for the newspaper &quot;The Bay Mirror&quot;. Soon after she discovers that she is pregnant and subsequently chooses to join Cole as his queen in The Underworld.

As season four draws to a close, Phoebe is forced to choose between her husband and her sisters. She mournfully sides with her sisters to vanquish Cole. Later, her unborn child is magically stolen by The Seer who claims that the child is rightfully hers and was never Phoebe&#x27;s. About to be sacrificed as human offerings during The Seer&#x27;s coronation as the new Source, Phoebe and her sisters tap into &quot;The Power of Three&quot; and vanquish The Seer and the entire Underworld council. In the season finale, the Angel of Destiny (Dakin Matthews) visits and gives the sisters an offer to live a normal life without magical powers or the threat of demons. After some contemplation Phoebe declines alongside her sisters, but the Angel of Destiny is not done with the sisters&#x27; and makes hints about Piper&#x27;s pregnancy, which only Phoebe takes the hint and announces it.

====Season 5====
For season five (2002–03), Phoebe attempts to live a life without Cole where she can focus on her career. This plan is stunted when a resurrected Cole returns to San Francisco eager to reconcile with Phoebe. After a series of attempts to win back Phoebe&#x27;s affections, even trying to seduce her to evil once again, Cole is vanquished in the 100th episode of the series, &quot;Centennial Charmed&quot;. Later in the season, Phoebe helps to deliver Piper and Leo&#x27;s first child, Wyatt Matthew Halliwell. Soon after she begins a romantic relationship with her new boss, multi-millionaire Jason Dean (Eric Dane).

====Season 6====
In season six (2003–04), Phoebe continues her relationship with Jason and also sees her magical abilities grow to include the power of empathy. Phoebe eventually becomes more serious with Jason, moving with him to Hong Kong. After a year of dating, Jason discovers Phoebe&#x27;s secret identity as a witch by accident and, unable to handle the revelation, breaks up with her. Phoebe subsequently moves back to San Francisco and into the Manor. In the episode &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Halliwell&quot;, Phoebe experiences a vision quest and not only discovers that her new time-traveling whitelighter Chris (Drew Fuller) is actually the second child of Piper and Leo and her nephew, but that she is also destined to have a child of her own. This puts Phoebe on a path of using her psychic powers to find the father of her child to the neglect of her other duties. For this, Phoebe is stripped of her unique powers by a Tribunal Council made up of both high-powered demons and Elders, though she retains her basic abilities as a witch and Charmed One. In the sixth-season finale, the sisters, Leo and Chris discover that a powerful Elder named Gideon (Gildart Jackson) wishes to destroy the Twice-Blessed Wyatt, an act which causes Wyatt to turn his back on good in the future.

====Season 7====
At the start of season seven (2004–05), Phoebe is still stripped of her powers. After she begins to feel disconnected from her advice column audience, Phoebe takes a sabbatical from work and is temporarily replaced by a ghost-writer Leslie St. Claire (Nick Lachey). Phoebe and Leslie enter a brief romance, but it does not last long as Leslie moves to Los Angeles. In the episode &quot;Styx Feet Under&quot;, Phoebe only regains her power of premonitions. In the hopes of having a demon-free life, Phoebe and her sisters join forces with The Avatars, powerful beings who are neither good nor evil, in their plan to turn the world into a utopia. Phoebe is the first of the sisters to regret this when her premonition powers show her how much the world has been robbed of its free will. The Charmed Ones team up with The Underworld&#x27;s new leader, Zankou (Oded Fehr) to defeat The Avatars. However, Zankou then turns on the sisters, becoming their adversary for the remainder of the season. During this season Cole, while stuck in Limbo, arranges for the good-natured demon Drake De&#x27;mon (Billy Zane) to enter Phoebe&#x27;s life and keep her from giving up on love. In the season seven finale, during a suicide mission to vanquish Zankou, Phoebe and her sisters fake their deaths in order to escape the constant threat of demon attacks, as well as police and government investigations.

====Season 8====
For the eighth and final season (2005–2006), Phoebe takes on the false identity of Julie Bennett (Monica Allgeier) and begins a relationship with an artist named Dex Lawson (Jason Lewis). While under the influence of a spell cast by the prodigy of the Charmed Ones, Billie Jenkins (Kaley Cuoco), Phoebe marries Dex under the alias of Julie. Unsure if she could ever have a lasting marriage with someone she is not completely honest with, Phoebe reveals the truth of her hidden identity to Dex. The pair eventually break up and agree to get an annulment. Phoebe later meets a cupid named Coop (Victor Webster), who was sent by The Elders to help her find love again. When Phoebe discovers that Billie and her sister, Christy (Marnette Patterson) are the ultimate power The Charmed Ones must defeat to save Leo from the Angel of Death (Simon Templeman), she has reservations because the women are human and not demons. In the end, Phoebe participates in the ultimate battle between The Charmed Ones and the Jenkins sisters, which destroys the Halliwell Manor, and only Piper and Billie survive. In the series finale &quot;Forever Charmed&quot;, Piper uses Coop&#x27;s time-traveling ring to call upon her mother and grandmother and save Phoebe and Paige. After Christy is defeated, Phoebe and her sisters write about their lives in the Book of Shadows. An epilogue shows Phoebe and Coop getting married and that their marriage will produce three children, all daughters. Phoebe also becomes a successful author, writing a self-help book on finding love.

===Literature===

As one of the central characters throughout the entire series, Phoebe appears in the majority of &quot;Charmed&quot; literature. These appearances first began in the series of novels. The novels follow no strict continuity with the series or each other, and are often considered to be non-canon. However, the television series producers have final approval of everything in the novels, which could indicate the literature fitting into the established canon of the series and the so-called &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot; universe&quot;. Phoebe&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Charmed&quot; literature takes place within the novel &quot;The Power of Three&quot; by Eliza Willard on November 1, 1999, which acts as a novelised version of the series premiere episode. Her last appearance in a &quot;Charmed&quot; novel takes place within &quot;Trickery Treat&quot; by Diana G. Gallagher on January 1, 2008.

In 2010, &quot;Charmed&quot; gained an officially licensed continuation in the form of a comic book, which is often billed as &quot;&quot;. The series is published monthly by Zenescope Entertainment. Set eighteen-months after the series finale, the sisters are seen living happy demon free lives and have each entered into motherhood. Phoebe has had her first daughter with her husband Coop, who is named Prudence Johnna and nicknamed P.J. by Grams. Phoebe is also seen preparing to return to work as an advice columnist for The Bay Mirror. In the second issue of the comic, Phoebe regains her previously stripped powers of Levitation and Empathy. In Issue #6 of the comic, &quot;Morality Bites Back&quot;, Phoebe learns that she used Advanced Empathy to murder Cal Greene in a previously visited future of February 26, 2009, by reflecting his emotions back onto him which caused his brain to overload.

==Powers and abilities==

===Magical powers===
In &quot;Charmed&quot; it is revealed that magical witches can develop and master a variety of magical skills and powers which include; scrying, spell casting, and brewing potent potions. As a magical witch Phoebe can utilize scrying, a divination art form that allows one to locate a missing object or person. Phoebe can also cast spells, often written in iambic pentameter or as a rhyming couplet, to influence others or the world around her. She can also brew potions, most often used to vanquish foes or to achieve other magical feats similar to the effects of a spell. As a witch and Charmed One, Phoebe has also developed a number of magical powers which include premonitions, levitation and empathy.

====Premonitions====
When Phoebe first comes into her powers, the first power she develops is the ability to see the future in the form of premonitions. Premonitions are considered to be a passive power. She triggers this power when she touches or is in the presence of something that is related to the subject of her premonitions, making them a form of psychometry. This originally only encompassed precognition, to see the future, but grew to include retrocognition, to see the past, as well. This power was initially uncontrollable, but in later seasons she learns to summon premonitions at will. While her premonitions are initially shown as black and white in the show, it is mentioned several times that Phoebe experiences them in color. As her power grows, her premonitions become more vivid to where they become slightly colored and she can hear and feel what is taking place. Phoebe&#x27;s premonition powers also allow her visions to reveal the truth. For instance, in the season one finale, &quot;Deja Vu All Over Again&quot;, when the world is caught within a recurring time loop by the time sorcerer Tempus (David Carradine), Phoebe is able to realize that the same day is repeating over and over again because of her premonition powers.

By season five, her power evolves to enable her to experience aspects of astral projection allowing her to interact with the environment of her premonitions. This aspect of her power is highlighted in the season five episodes &quot;The Eyes Have It&quot; and &quot;Sand Francisco Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, as well as the season eight episode &quot;Hulkus Pocus&quot;. Her premonition powers also evolve to allow Phoebe to anticipate the actions of others as in many instances Phoebe has sidestepped and jumped out the way of incoming fireballs and energy balls with perfect timing. Examples of this can be seen in the season seven episodes &quot;Freaky Phoebe&quot;, where Phoebe is able to sense a demon who is behind her with a pair of scissors, and in the episode &quot;Ordinary Witches&quot;, where Ronnie (Brian Howe), a cab driver Phoebe loses her powers to, is able to sense when and where the next fireball of a demon is going to be launched using her power of premonitions. Phoebe also develops the power to trigger a vision in someone else with similar powers, &quot;sharing&quot; visions with Elders and knowing how to trigger a specific &quot;trap&quot; premonition in the evil witch Mitzy (Jenny McCarthy), who has temporary possession of her powers. Kyra (Charisma Carpenter), a powerful demonic seer, tells Phoebe her powers were once limited to psychometry but they grew, like Phoebe&#x27;s will in time.

====Levitation====
At the start of season three, in the episode &quot;The Honeymoon&#x27;s Over&quot;, Phoebe obtains her first active power in the form of levitation, the power to defy gravity and float in the air. This power is uncontrollable when she first obtains it, but she later learns to maintain complete control over it. When new to her power, Phoebe is unable to move horizontally, and in the season three episode &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, Prue uses telekinesis to guide Phoebe across a cavern while she is levitating. Later in the series, Phoebe often mixes her martial arts and kick boxing with her levitating power to knock out her enemies. In season four, the power advances so that Phoebe is able to glide short distances while levitating and she even learns to use her power to walk on walls. During the fifth season, she is able to propel herself while levitating, as seen when she propels herself through a ventilation duct with her levitation powers in the episode &quot;The Importance of Being Phoebe&quot;. In the season six episode &quot;Forget Me... Not&quot;, Phoebe showcases a form of projective levitation, when she levitates herself and a weatherman. Phoebe displays projective levitation again in the episode &quot;Love&#x27;s a Witch&quot; when she levitates the pillow she is sitting on along with her.

In the &quot;Charmed&quot; comic books, specifically in issue #16 &quot;The Heavens Can Wait&quot;, her power has been shown to have grown stronger, allowing Phoebe to levitate Paige&#x27;s orb shield which contained herself, her two sisters and Leo. While inside the Nexus of The All, Phoebe became able to use her power to its full potential, allowing her to not only fly but also to carry Piper and Paige with ease. Later, Prue tells Phoebe that her power will advance to this stage naturally at some point in the future.

====Empathy====
Season six sees Phoebe develop the power of empathy, the power to sense and experience the emotions of others. Being an empath allows Phoebe to directly channel the emotions of those around her. This initially causes considerable problems, as after encountering the emotions of others Phoebe would sometimes act on their whims or amplify and broadcast her own feelings, such as once triggering a fight in the &quot;Bay Mirror&quot; offices by accident (Although this could have unintended advantages; when the Halliwells were attacked by a demon that trapped them in their ideal worlds, Phoebe quickly realized something was wrong because her empathy powers caused her to tap into her boyfriend&#x27;s desire for her to be a large-scale success where Phoebe was content being a local celebrity). In the &quot;Charmed&quot; series, magical powers are tied to the user&#x27;s emotions, and because Phoebe can feel the emotions of others, her empathy allows her to sometimes tap into other characters&#x27; magical powers. This is first seen in the second half of the two-part season six premiere, &quot;Valhalley of the Dolls (Part 2)&quot;. When a Valkyrie-turned-Piper attacks Phoebe, she channels Piper&#x27;s telekinetic Valkyrie powers to where she can use them herself. This channeling of Valkyrie Piper&#x27;s powers also made her powers, when used against Phoebe, ineffective. In later episodes, Phoebe also uses empathy to deflect energy balls and fireballs, causing them to backfire on their users.

In the season two episode, &quot;Morality Bites&quot;, when the sisters travel to the future, it is revealed that Phoebe uses a magical power to kill a man named Cal Greene out of revenge. In the &quot;Charmed&quot; comics issue #6, &quot;Morality Bites Back&quot;, Phoebe learns that this power is an advanced form of empathy, which is called Pathokinesis. Phoebe discovers that her empathy powers grow to allow her to incapacitate or even kill another person. In the comics, Phoebe realizes that she murders Cal Greene by reflecting his emotions back onto him, flooding his mind with painful emotions and memories of the women he had hurt, which causes his brain to overload.

===Natural abilities===
Early in the series, Phoebe is revealed to be a skilled pick-pocket; having picked up the technique during her rebellious teen years. Also, to make up for initially only having a passive power, Phoebe takes classes in self-defense. Her skills in hand-to-hand combat which includes Kung-Fu, Jeet Kune Do, &amp; Kickboxing have advanced to the point where Phoebe is capable of beating multiple adversaries, most notably demonic wrestlers, furies, and vampires.

==Reception==
Milano and Doherty&#x27;s rumored off-screen feud earned them a nomination for Best Fight at the 2001 Wand Awards. In 2004, she was nominated for Favorite Female TV Character at the Spacey Awards in Canada. At the 2005 Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, Milano was nominated for Favorite Television Actress. The following year, she was nominated for Television – Choice Actress at the Teen Choice Awards.

Kristin Sample of AOL TV called Phoebe &quot;the hottest&quot; witch out of the Halliwell sisters. In his review of the pilot episode, Ray Richmond of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine described Phoebe as &quot;a free-spirited, self-absorbed conspiracy buff.&quot; In another review of the pilot episode, John Levesque of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; also labelled Phoebe &quot;free-spirited&quot;, but felt that Milano&#x27;s acting needed &quot;seasoning.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Michael Abernethy wrote that Milano provided &quot;a lighter touch&quot; to &quot;Charmed&quot; and noted that her &quot;comic training&quot; in sitcoms was &quot;ideal for her carefree character&quot; Phoebe. Angelica Bastien of &quot;Bustle&quot; magazine called Phoebe a &quot;fan favorite&quot; and commented that Milano &quot;definitely fits the role much better than Lori [Rom] did. Just check out the Youtube video comparing their different takes on the character to see why it&#x27;s best Milano took on the role.&quot; Brett Cullum of DVD Verdict named Phoebe &quot;a wacky free spirit spitfire&quot; and also believed that Milano was the right choice for Phoebe as she &quot;provided an innate sense of comedy that rounded out the cast well.&quot; Rob Lineberger of the same publication felt that Milano&#x27;s acting in the fifth season was &quot;over the top in every way&quot; and noted that she had a &quot;hysterical physical presence.&quot; In his review of the sixth season, Lineberger wrote that Milano was &quot;still singularly, blissfully goofy.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Gillian Flynn also praised the comedy moments in the sixth season, writing &quot;Milano has turned exasperation into an art form, as she&#x27;s morphed into everything from Mata Hari to her combat-booted former teen self this season.&quot;

BuzzFeed&#x27;s Jarett Wieselman commented on Phoebe&#x27;s outfits in the later seasons, noting that many of the episodes featured her wearing &quot;a series of progressively revealing and ridiculous costumes in the name of vanquishing.&quot; Joshua Levs of CNN labelled the costumes worn by Phoebe and her sisters &quot;so skimpy&quot;, and noted that some of her memorable costumes included being a mermaid, &quot;a leather-clad comic-book hero&quot;, and &quot;topless on a horse.&quot; Levs also added that casting directors should pay attention because &quot;Milano can act.&quot; A writer for MovieWeb described Phoebe as a &quot;great, interesting, and relateable character.&quot; The writer also praised Milano for delivering an &quot;incredibly convincing and believable performance&quot;, further adding that she &quot;was another great casting choice&quot; for &quot;Charmed&quot;. Hypable.com&#x27;s Tariq Kyle felt that Phoebe was the best character on the show, adding &quot;She&#x27;s sweet and innocent in a lot of ways, but she&#x27;s also strong and realistic. She&#x27;s smart, but she&#x27;s relatable. She still fails and makes mistakes, but she constantly grows.&quot;

==Cultural impact==
In 2007, AOL TV ranked Phoebe at number seven on their list of the Top TV Witches. She also ranked seventh on the same list the following year. Virgin Media placed Phoebe at number 11 on their list of TV Temptresses, writing &quot;As one of the trio of glamorous witches on ghostly drama &quot;Charmed&quot;, Phoebe can use her psychic premonitions for all sorts of japery including romance.&quot; Milano was referenced in the 2002 teen comedy film &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; due to her portrayal as a witch in &quot;Charmed&quot;. In the film, Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) recalls watching an episode of &quot;Charmed&quot; on The WB where Milano &quot;was about to cast a spell on her cute demon boyfriend.&quot; In his review of the television series &quot;Witches of East End&quot; being too similar to &quot;Charmed&quot;, Christian Cintron of Hollywood.com noted that Jenna Dewan-Tatum&#x27;s &quot;ne&#x27;er-do-well, bed-hopping character&quot; Freya Beauchamp is a lot like Phoebe.

<text>Violaceae is a family of flowering plants established in 1802, consisting of about 1000 species in about 25 genera. It takes its name from the genus &quot;Viola&quot;, the violets and pansies.

Older classifications such as the Cronquist system placed the Violaceae in an order named after it, the Violales or the Parietales. However, molecular phylogeny studies place the family in the Malpighiales as reflected in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification, with 41 other families, where it is situated in the parietal clade of 11 families. Most of the species are found in three large genera, &quot;Viola&quot;, &quot;Rinorea&quot; and &quot;Hybanthus&quot;. The other genera are largely monotypic or oligotypic. The genera are grouped into four clades within the family. The species are largely tropical or subtropical but &quot;Viola&quot; has a number of species in temperate regions. Many genera have a very restricted distribution.

==Description==

Though the best-known genus, &quot;Viola&quot;, is herbaceous, most species are shrubs, lianas or small trees. The simple leaves are alternate or opposite, often with leafy stipules or the stipules are reduced in size. Some species have palmate or deeply dissected leaves. Many species are acaulescent. The flower are solitary in panicles. Some species have cleistogamous flowers produced after or before the production of typical flowers with petals. Flowers are bisexual or unisexual (e.g. &quot;Melicytus&quot;), actinomorphic but typically zygomorphic with a calyx of five sepals that are persistent after flowering. Corollae have five mostly unequal petals, and the anterior petal is larger and often spurred. Plants have five stamens with the abaxial stamen often spurred at the base. The gynoecium is a compound pistil of three united carpels with one locule. Styles are simple, with the ovary superior and containing many ovules. The fruits are capsules split by way of three seams. Seeds have endosperm.

== Taxonomy ==
That &quot;Viola&quot;, previously included by Jussieu (1789) under Cisti, should have its own family was first proposed by Ventenat in 1799, and in 1803 placed the &quot;Viola&quot; species in a new genus, &quot;Ionidium&quot; which he described as &quot;Famille des violettes.&quot; However, in the meantime Batsch established the Violaceae, as a suprageneric rank under the name of Violariae (1802), and as the first formal description, bears his name as the botanical authority. Batsch included eight genera in this family. Although Violariae continued to be used by some authors, such as Don (1831) and Bentham and Hooker (1862) (as Violarieae), most authors, such as Engler (1895), adopted the alternative name Violaceae, proposed by de Lamarck and de Candolle in 1805, and later by Gingins (1823) and Saint-Hilaire (1824). With the establishment of higher suprafamiliar orders, which he called &quot;Alliances&quot;, Lindley (1853) placed his Violaceae within the Violales.

==Genera==
24 genera are accepted.

=== Phylogeny ===
Historically, Violaceae has been placed within a number of orders since Lindley&#x27;s treatment, principally Violales (Hutchinson, Takhtajan, Cronquist, Thorne) and the equivalent Parietales (Bentham and Hooker, Engler and Prantl, Melchior), although such placement was considered unsatisfactory, but also Polygalinae (Hallier) and Guttiferales (Bessey). Of these, that of Melchior (1925), within the Engler and Prantl system, has been considered one of the most influential. Molecular phylogenetics resulted in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) places it as one of a large number of families within the eudicot order Malpighiales. Violaceae, as one of 42 families, is placed in a clade of 10 families within the order. Its place within the parietal clade reflects its earlier position in Parietales, those families with parietal placentation. There it forms a sister group to Goupiaceae.

=== Subdivision ===
==== History ====
The Violaceae are a medium-sized family with about 22–28 genera, and about 1,000–1,100 species. Most of the genera are monotypic or oligotypic, but the three genera &quot;Viola&quot; (about 600 species), &quot;Rinorea&quot; (about 250 species), and &quot;Hybanthus&quot; include 98% of the species with about half the species in &quot;Viola&quot;, and more than three-quarters of the remainder in the other two genera.

Many attempts have been made at an intrafamilial classification, but these have largely been artificial, based on floral characteristics. Subdivisions were recognized almost immediately. Early classifications identified two major divisions, that were followed by most taxonomists;
* Alsodeieae. (Alsodineae, Rinoreeae). Radially symmetrical flowers (actinomorphic)
* Violeae. Bilaterally symmetrical flowers (zygomorphic)

These also had biogeographical correlation, with the latter being almost exclusively South American and African, and the former being distributed in Europe in addition to the Americas. In contrast, Bentham and Hooker (and some others) divided Alsodeieae, giving three tribes;
* Violeae. Strictly zygomorphic
* Paypayroleae. Actinomorphic with some zygomorphic features
* Alsodeieae. Strictly actinomorphic

Melchior utilized a more complex classification with two subfamilies, tribes and subtribes to recognize the place of &quot;Leonia&quot; within the Violaceae;.
* Subfamily Violoideae
** Tribe Rinoreeae
*** Subtribe Rinoreinae (&quot;Rinorea&quot;, &quot;Allexis&quot;, &quot;Gloeospermum&quot;)
*** Subtribe Hymenantherina (&quot;Melicytus&quot;, &quot;Hymenanthera&quot;)
*** Subtribe Isodendriinae (&quot;Isodendrion&quot;)
*** Subtribe Paypayrolinae (&quot;Amphirrhox&quot;, &quot;Paypayrola&quot;)
** Tribe Violeae
*** Subtribe Hybanthinae (&quot;Hybanthus&quot;, &quot;Agatea&quot;)
*** Subtribe Violinae (&quot;Anchietea&quot;, &quot;Corynostylis&quot;, &quot;Schweiggeria&quot;, &quot;Noisettia&quot;, &quot;Viola&quot;)
* Subfamily Leonioideae (&quot;Leonia&quot;)

The historical subdivisions shown here are those of the system of Hekking (1988), based largely on floral symmetry, petal aestivation and petal morphology. In this system, most genera occur in the Rinoreae and Violeae tribes. Three subfamilies have been recognized: the Violoideae, Leonioideae, and Fusispermoideae.

===== Subfamily Fusispermoideae =====
*&quot;Fusispermum&quot; 

===== Subfamily Leonioideae =====
*&quot;Leonia&quot; 

===== Subfamily Violoideae =====
====== Tribe Rinoreeae ======
====== Subtribe Hymenantherinae ======
*&quot;Hymenanthera&quot; 
*&quot;Melicytus&quot; 

====== Subtribe Isodendriinae ======
*&quot;Isodendrion&quot; 

====== Subtribe Paypayrolinae ======
*&quot;Amphirrhox&quot; 
*&quot;Paypayrola&quot; (including &quot;Hekkingia&quot; )

====== Subtribe Rinoreinae ======
*&quot;Allexis&quot; 
*&quot;Decorsella&quot; (including &quot;Gymnorinorea&quot; )
*&quot;Gloeospermum&quot; 
*&quot;Rinorea&quot; (including &quot;Alsodeia&quot; , &quot;Phyllanoa&quot; , &quot;Scyphellandra&quot; )
*&quot;Rinoreocarpus&quot; 

====== Tribe Violeae ======
About 600 species, in the following genera, but mainly in &quot;Viola&quot; and &quot;Hybanthus&quot; and including all four of the lianescent genera in the family (&quot;Agatea&quot;, &quot;Anchietea&quot;, &quot;Calyptrion&quot; and &quot;Hybanthopsis&quot;;
* &quot;Anchietea&quot; 
* &quot;Corynostylis&quot; (including &quot;Agatea&quot; and &quot;Agation&quot; and a synonym of &quot;Calyptrion&quot;)
* &quot;Hybanthopsis&quot; 
* &quot;Hybanthus&quot; (included &quot;Acentra&quot; , &quot;Clelandia&quot; , &quot;Cubelium&quot; , &quot;Ionidium&quot; , &quot;Pigea&quot; )
* &quot;Mayanaea&quot; 
* &quot;Noisettia&quot; 
* &quot;Orthion&quot; 
* &quot;Pombalia&quot; 
* &quot;Schweiggeria&quot; 
* &quot;Viola&quot; (including &quot;Erpetion&quot; , &quot;Mnemion&quot; )

==== Molecular systems ====
Molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed that many of these divisions were not monophyletic, partly due to homoplasy. These studies demonstrate four major clades within the family.

The molecularly defined subdivisions are;
* Clade 1: &quot;Viola&quot;, &quot;Schweiggeria&quot;, &quot;Noisettia&quot;, &quot;Allexis&quot;
* Clade 2: &quot;Paypayrola&quot;, &quot;Hekkingia&quot;
* Clade 3: &quot;Leonia&quot;, &quot;Gloeospermum&quot;, &quot;Amphirrhox&quot;, &quot;Orthion&quot;, &quot;Mayanaea&quot;, &quot;Hybanthus concolor&quot;, the &quot;Hybanthus havanensis&quot; Group, and the &quot;Hybanthus caledonicus&quot; Group
* Clade 4: largely unresolved

In Clade 1, &quot;Schweiggeria&quot; and &quot;Noisettia&quot; are monotypic and form a sister group to &quot;Viola&quot;. In addition to the major clades, there were a number of unplaced segregates.

=== Etymology ===
The family derives its name from the nominative genus, &quot;Viola&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Violaceae have an overall cosmopolitan distribution, but are essentially tropical and subtropical, with the exception of the numerous Northern Hemisphere temperate species of &quot;Viola&quot;, the largest genus, which is also occurs at higher altitudes in its tropical and subtropical regions, where the shrub, tree and lianescent species are concentrated. In those regions, most representative genera are the mainly woody &quot;Rinorea&quot; and &quot;Hybanthus&quot;. While &quot;Viola&quot;, &quot;Hybanthus&quot;, and &quot;Rinorea&quot; are widely distributed in both hemispheres, the remaining genera are relatively restricted in their distribution. Some are restricted to a single continent while others have a limited area involving just a single archipelago. About 70 species are found in Brazil.

<text>Paige Matthews is a fictional character from the American television series &quot;Charmed&quot;, played by Rose McGowan from October 4, 2001, until May 21, 2006. The character was created by executive producer Brad Kern as a replacement for lead character Prue Halliwell, following the departure of actress Shannen Doherty. Paige is introduced into season four as the fiercely independent younger half-sister of the female leads, Prue (Shannen Doherty), Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano). Like her sisters, Paige is a witch and more specifically, a Charmed One—one of the most powerful witches of all time. Paige is introduced as the secret love child of the Halliwell sisters&#x27; mother Patty (Finola Hughes) and her whitelighter (guardian angel) Sam Wilder (Scott Jaeck), making Paige both a witch and whitelighter. She was given up at birth and raised by her adoptive parents, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews.

At the beginning of season four, Paige goes on to help reconstitute The Charmed Ones by taking Prue&#x27;s place in the &quot;Power of Three&quot;, following her death in the season three finale. Like Prue, Paige possesses telekinetic abilities, but due to her mixed whitelighter heritage, this manifests as the ability to orb (&quot;teleport&quot;) objects from one location to another through a vocal command. As the series progresses, Paige also receives whitelighter abilities such as the power to orb herself and others, as well as sensing, glamouring and healing also the power of photokinesis. Paige&#x27;s storylines have often revolved around her protecting innocents and defeating the forces of evil in San Francisco with her sisters. In the later seasons, she eventually receives her own whitelighter charges to train and protect as they learn witchcraft. Paige also has romantic relationships with fellow-witch Richard Montana (Balthazar Getty) in season six and FBI agent Kyle Brody (Kerr Smith) in season seven. In the eighth and final season, Paige marries a human parole officer named Henry Mitchell (Ivan Sergei).

The character was mostly well received by television critics, who complimented Paige&#x27;s personality and felt that McGowan was the right choice for the role. McGowan won the Family Television Award for Favorite Sister in 2005 for her portrayal of Paige. In 2007, AOL TV ranked Paige at number 13 on their list of the Top TV Witches, the lowest of the four sisters. In addition to the television series, the character has also appeared in numerous expanded universe material, such as the &quot;Charmed&quot; novels and its comic book adaptation.

==Casting and development==
The character of Paige Matthews was conceived by executive producer Brad Kern as a replacement character for Prue Halliwell (Shannen Doherty). In May 2001, it was officially announced that Doherty would be departing &quot;Charmed&quot;. The producers originally considered recasting the role of Prue with a different actress. Executive producer Aaron Spelling even approached actresses Tiffani Thiessen, who replaced Doherty on his previous series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and Jennifer Love Hewitt to take on the role as Doherty&#x27;s replacement. Spelling revealed to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Tiffani was our first choice to take over for Shannen - even before we asked Jennifer [Love Hewitt], but Tiffani told us she wants to do a half-hour comedy.&quot; Hewitt also declined the role. Producers then decided to kill off the character of Prue and replace her with a long-lost younger sister in favor of having &quot;a fresh face&quot; join the series. Spelling stated, &quot;[The character&#x27;s] going to be the long-lost sister Alyssa and Holly never knew [they] had. And wait until you see what we came up with to explain why she&#x27;s been lost: Nobody ever knew she even existed.&quot;

Film actress Rose McGowan was later revealed to be cast in the role of Paige Matthews, her first role as a series regular on a television series. Kern stated, &quot;From Paige&#x27;s point of view, you go to bed one night and you think you&#x27;re a single child and no one understands you. Then you wake up the next morning and you find out you&#x27;ve got sisters who are witches, who&#x27;ve got supernatural powers, who have a destiny that you must now share and embrace and you must learn your new powers.&quot; He later elaborated saying, &quot;When we meet her, she will have been searching for many years, both for her birth parents, but also for an answer to that feeling that she&#x27;s had inside of her that there&#x27;s something special, there&#x27;s something else that nobody has yet been able to understand and explain.&quot; On casting McGowan in the role of Paige, Kern admitted, &quot;Our personal hope was to find somebody that would be of Shannen&#x27;s calibre, that would have the sexiness, the edge and the range. That, for the age range we were looking for, is hard to find. We said, &#x27;We don&#x27;t want somebody conventional. We don&#x27;t want a shrinking violet. We don&#x27;t want just another pretty face that smiles and has great teeth. We want somebody who has an attitude.&#x27; I think Rose definitely has an attitude and that&#x27;s an energy that we can take advantage of for the betterment of the show.&quot;

==Appearances==
===Television===

Paige appears as the secret half-sister in the final five seasons of &quot;Charmed&quot;, portrayed by Rose McGowan within 112 episodes from 2001 to 2006. In the episode &quot;Charmed Again&quot;, it is revealed that after Paige&#x27;s adoptive parents (played by Lisa Darr and M. Scott Wilkinson) died, she went searching for her birth parents and suspected that she might be related to the Halliwell sisters. With Patty Halliwell (Finola Hughes) long since deceased, Paige relented on pursuing the matter further. After the Source of All Evil learns of Paige&#x27;s existence, he orders her killed. Paige is eventually saved by Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano) and her boyfriend Cole Turner (Julian McMahon) and then subsequently introduced to Piper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs) and her husband Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause). Paige then goes on to help reconstitute The Charmed Ones by taking Prue Halliwell&#x27;s (Shannen Doherty) place in &quot;The Power of Three&quot;. This is made possible after it is revealed that she is the daughter of Patty and the Whitelighter Sam Wilder (Scott Jaeck), making her a &quot;sister-witch&quot; to Phoebe and Piper. The episode reveals that Paige was given up at birth to protect her from the wrath of The Elders if they were to discover her Whitelighter heritage.

Like her sister Prue, Paige was born with &quot;the ability to move things with her mind&quot;. Since she possessed the missing power, she was able to take her place in the Power of Three, thus reforming the Charmed Ones. Due to her Whitelighter heritage, however, her magical method of movement causes &quot;objects to orb from a location to another&quot;. Paige has also shown the ability to impart momentum on these orbing objects. Throughout season four, Paige shows that she has inherited a variety of Whitelighter powers such as orbing, and sensing. While Paige finds it easier to develop a friendship with Phoebe, she initially butts heads with Piper, but eventually the two sisters develop a mutual respect.

Later in the season, Paige reveals her identity as a witch to her childhood friend and &quot;sometimes&quot; boyfriend, Glen Belland (Jesse Woodrow). Once she develops more control over her witchcraft Paige is able to help her sisters&#x27; avenge Prue&#x27;s death and vanquish the Source twice – both in his original incarnation and that of his next incarnation, Cole Turner. During the finale of season four, Paige and her sisters are visited by the Angel of Destiny (Dakin Matthews), who offers them the chance to live normal lives without magical powers or the threat of demons. Over the course of the episode, Paige eventually convinces her sisters to decline the offer and remain Charmed to continue doing good in the world.

At the start of season five (2002–2003), Paige is officially promoted to social worker in the episode, &quot;A Witch&#x27;s Tail (Part 1)&quot;, but by the end of the second episode, &quot;A Witch&#x27;s Tail (Part 2)&quot;, Paige quits her job to pursue being a witch full-time. During this season Paige meets Sam Wilder (her birth-father) and slowly comes to terms with letting him into her life. Meanwhile, she struggles with living up to the legend of her deceased half-sister Prue and her title of &quot;Superwitch&quot;. When Paige masters a difficult spell created by Prue, she appears to come at peace with her sibling rivalry. Later in the season, Paige, alongside Phoebe, trains to be a midwife in order to deliver Piper&#x27;s baby. When Piper gives birth to a boy she names Wyatt, she also gives him the middle name Matthew in honor of his aunt Paige.

In the sixth season (2003–2004), Paige grows tired of unemployment and obtains a job at a temp agency. While employed on the various jobs via the agency, Paige finds herself drawn into various magical endeavors concerning members of the magical community. Through one of these magical journeys she meets and later dates a witch named Richard Montana (Balthazar Getty), a relationship which mirrors the love affair Phoebe had with Cole as Richard attempts to avoid the temptations of dark magic. The couple eventually break up, but not before Paige binds Richard&#x27;s powers so that he doesn&#x27;t feel the temptation to misuse his powers.

Also in this season, Paige becomes the second person to discover that the sisters&#x27; new time-traveling Whitelighter Chris Perry (Drew Fuller) is actually Chris Halliwell and the second child of Piper and Leo. He has come back in time to prevent Wyatt from becoming evil in the future. Together, Chris helps Paige and her sisters discover that a powerful Elder named Gideon (Gildart Jackson) wishes to destroy the Twice-Blessed Wyatt, an act which causes Wyatt to turn his back on good in the future.

During the start of the seventh season (2004–2005), Paige fights to keep Magic School from closing after the death of its headmaster, Gideon. The Elders then place Paige in charge of Magic School as the new headmistress once they realize how deep her dedication runs. Also this season, Paige befriends federal agent Kyle Brody (Kerr Smith), and the two eventually grow close over their mutual investigation of The Avatars, powerful beings who are neither good nor evil. After initial hesitation, Paige and her sisters join sides with The Avatars in their plan to turn the world into a utopia against the warnings of both Kyle and The Elders. When The Charmed Ones discover that the new utopia robs the world of their free will, they join sides with Kyle and the demon Zankou (Oded Fehr) and force The Avatars to restore the world to normal. Kyle, however, is killed in the process, but is resurrected as a Whitelighter as a reward from The Elders for helping to defeat The Avatars. He says his goodbyes to Paige, before leaving to start his new life.

In late season seven, in episode seventeen &quot;Scry Hard&quot;, Paige grows tired of being cooped up in Magic School and desires a reprieve from her duties as headmistress. At the suggestion of Piper and Phoebe, Paige instates the now human Leo as the new headmaster of Magic School in her place so that she can take a break while Leo can work in a place safe from the harm of demon attacks. The following episode, &quot;Little Box of Horrors&quot;, The Elders manage to convince Paige that her continued quest for a life outside her role as a Charmed One stems from her destiny as a future Whitelighter. In the episode &quot;Freaky Phoebe&quot;, Paige takes on official Whitelighter duties and gains her first charge in a witch named Mitchell Haines (Seamus Dever) who has the power of superhuman speed. In the season seven finale, during a suicide mission to vanquish Zankou, Paige and her sisters fake their deaths in order to escape the constant threat of demon attacks as well as police and government investigations.

In the eighth and final season (2005–2006), Paige takes on the false identity of Jo Bennett (Christina Ulloa) and attempts to live a normal life free of magic. This proves to be impossible, as Paige hears the continual call of a new charge, a telekinetic witch named Billie Jenkins (Kaley Cuoco). In the fifth episode of season eight, &quot;Rewitched&quot;, Paige and her sisters reclaim their true identities with the help of federal agent Murphy (Brandon Quinn) in exchange for helping the FBI handle supernatural investigations.

Episode eight, &quot;Battle of the Hexes&quot;, introduces Paige to parole officer Henry Mitchell (Ivan Sergei). After a courtship, which involves Henry discovering Paige&#x27;s secret identity as a witch and whitelighter, the couple get married in the episode &quot;Engaged and Confused&quot;. Later in the season, Paige discovers that her charge Billie and her sister, Christy Jenkins (Marnette Patterson) are the ultimate power The Charmed Ones must defeat to save Leo from the Angel of Death (Simon Templeman), but she has reservations because the women are human and not demons. In the end, Paige willingly participates in the ultimate battle between The Charmed Ones and the Jenkins sisters. After the series end, it is shown in flashforwards that Paige accepts her role as a Whitelighter, aiding many witches and future Whitelighters that include her nieces and nephews. It is also revealed that Paige and Henry&#x27;s marriage will produce three children, twin daughters and a son.

===Literature===

As one of the central characters of the series, Paige appears in a number of &quot;Charmed&quot; literature. These appearances first began in the eleventh book of the series of novels. The novels follow no strict continuity with the series or each other and are often considered to be non-canon. However, the television series producers have final approval of everything in the novels, which could indicate the literature fitting into the established canon of the series and the so-called &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot; universe&quot;. Paige&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Charmed&quot; literature takes place within the novel &quot;Charmed Again&quot; by Elizabeth Lenhard in 2002, which acts as a novelised version of the fourth season premiere episode. Her last appearance in a &quot;Charmed&quot; novel takes place within &quot;Trickery Treat&quot; by Diana G. Gallagher on January 1, 2008.

In 2010, &quot;Charmed&quot; gained an officially licensed continuation in the form of a comic book, which is often billed as &quot;&quot;. The series is published monthly by Zenescope Entertainment. Set eighteen-months after the series finale, the sisters are seen living happy demon free lives and have each entered into motherhood. Paige has had twin girls with Henry Mitchell named Kat and Tamora Mitchell. In the comic series, Paige is working as a full-time Whitelighter and can also be seen helping Leo at Magic School with his students. In Issue #3, &quot;Innocents Lost&quot;, Paige develops a new power in the form of a reinforced forcefield made up of orbs. Later in Issue #8, &quot;Oh, Henry&quot;, Paige rescues a baby from the womb of his dying mother. She and Henry later adopt the infant boy and name him Henry, Jr. In the seventeenth issue of the comics, Paige looks for a witch named Sarah at a Salem house; however, she meets Cole who won&#x27;t let her in. Despite his pleas, she orbs into the house where she meets Prudence (Prue) and the two touch causing their powers to send them away. After recovering, Patience tells Paige that she is Prue. At first, Paige doesn&#x27;t believe her, but they go to the manor where after six years, Prue, Piper and Phoebe are finally reunited with a hug.

==Powers and abilities==
===Witch abilities===
In &quot;Charmed&quot; it is revealed that magical witches can develop and master a variety of magical skills and powers which include; scrying, spell casting, and brewing potent potions. As a magical witch Paige can utilize scrying, a divination art form that allows one to locate a missing object or person. Paige can also cast spells, often written in iambic pentameter or as a rhyming couplet, to influence others or the world around her. She can also brew potions, most often used to vanquish foes or to achieve other magical feats similar to the effects of a spell. As a witch and Charmed One, Paige has also developed a number of magical powers which include Telekinetic Orbing and Force Field (sometimes called Orb Shield).

====Telekinetic Orbing====
In the second half of the two-part season four premiere, &quot;Charmed Again (Part 2)&quot;, Paige displays her method of moving objects with her mind by teleporting objects from one location to another through a vocal command. When she vocally calls the name of an object or living being it will orb to her, appearing in hand or within close range to her body. This power is sometimes labeled Telekinetic Orbing. Due to her Whitelighter side, Paige&#x27;s telekinetic power carries aspects of teleportation, although she still showcases the ability to impart momentum on the objects she orbs allowing her to throw them across distances. Telekinetic Orbing does not require a great deal of accuracy in calling an object. For instance, in the season six episode &quot;Hyde School Reunion&quot;, Paige orbs demonic acid by using the vocal call, &quot;Icky stuff&quot;. She also displays the lack of need for accuracy in the episode &quot;A Wrong Day&#x27;s Journey into Right&quot; when she redirects a shuriken by calling out, &quot;Weapon...thingy.&quot;

Over the course of her time on the series, Paige&#x27;s powers grow in strength allowing her to move things without verbally calling for them. This can be seen in the episode, &quot;Sword and the City&quot; when she orbs the stoned encased Excalibur into the attic of the Manor without a vocal command. She shows this skill again in the season eight episode &quot;Repo Manor&quot; when she orbs the replica dollhouse of the Manor into the attic without saying anything as well. By late season seven, it becomes evident that Paige can now orb people and demons to any location by saying the name of the desired location. For example, she orbs Phoebe back to the Manor by stating, &quot;Home!&quot; in the episode &quot;Charmed Noir&quot;. Towards the end of season eight, Paige displays the advanced skill of being able to orb and throw adult sized demons and people across distances in a similar fashion to Prue&#x27;s telekinetic lift and throw method. The most prominent example of this occurs when she orbs the demon Asmodeus (Steven J. Oliver), a member of The Triad, directly into a fireball thrown by fellow Triad member Baliel (Sören Oliver). Paige also simultaneously orbs and throws two demons into a dumpster in the episode &quot;Gone with the Witches&quot;.

====Orb Shield====
In the &quot;Charmed&quot; comics, specifically Issue #3, &quot;Innocents Lost&quot;, Paige develops a new power in the form of a reinforced force field made up of orbs. Paige displays the ability to encase others inside of her force fields, without being within them herself, when she uses her new power to contain the explosion caused by the resurrected Source&#x27;s destruction in the tenth issue of the comic series, &quot;Three Little Wiccans&quot;. In this same issue, Paige also uses her force field power offensively to push back demons.

===Whitelighter powers===
In &quot;Charmed&quot; a Whitelighter is a human soul that has been made a &quot;guardian angel&quot; for good witches and other future Whitelighters (also known as a Whitelighter&#x27;s &quot;charge&quot;). A Whitelighter acts in the service of The Elders who bestow these souls with their new angelic powers. Because Paige&#x27;s father, Sam Wilder, is a Whitelighter, she has inherited a number of powers associated with this race of guardian angels which include Orbing, Sensing, Glamouring and Healing. Of important note is that her Whitelighter powers exist independently from her witch powers, which has proven handy in situations where her witch powers were stolen or rendered null.

====Orbing====
Paige enters the series with the ability to orb, a teleporting ability unique to Whitelighters that allows them to travel anywhere in the world as well as between various supernatural worlds, including the magically guarded realm of The Elders (often called &quot;Up There&quot; in the show). In the season four episode &quot;A Paige from the Past&quot;, it is revealed that Paige has always had access to her power to orb, as the ability saves her from dying in the car crash that killed her adoptive parents. When we are introduced to Paige, her orbing power can only be channeled in panic induced situations as a fear response. She is also only able to orb in and out within the same place, which makes her unable to travel across distances with the power. In the season four episode &quot;The Three Faces of Phoebe&quot;, Paige displays growth with her orbing powers by transporting herself across town for the first time. In the same episode, she also displays the advanced ability of orbing with passengers. Despite taking on the full duties of a Whitelighter by the eighth and final season of the series, Paige never shows the ability to orb &quot;Up There&quot;. Instead, whenever she congregates with an Elder, she orbs to the top of the suspension tower of the Golden Gate Bridge to hold a meeting (though since she has successfully orbed to the Underworld on several occasions, this may have more to do with her personal attitude towards them than a lack of ability).

====Sensing====
In late season four, it is revealed that Paige has acquired the ability of sensing, a supernatural power which grants a Whitelighter a magical awareness of a charge&#x27;s location and physical well-being. Paige&#x27;s first instance of full on sensing is seen in the episode &quot;Saving Private Leo&quot;. Paige&#x27;s sensing power enables her to hear the &quot;call&quot; of her charges whenever they are in need, allowing her to go to them when they need her most. Before becoming a full-fledged Whitelighter, Paige displays the ability to hear her sisters&#x27; &quot;call&quot; when she is far away from them. As a Whitelighter, her charges must not always vocally call out to her when they are in need. The sensing power allows the Whitelighter to instantly hear a charge&#x27;s inner call whenever the charge is in immediate danger, which is, more often than not, life-threatening.

====Healing====
Paige first shows a talent for healing in the season four premiere, &quot;Charmed Again (Part 2)&quot;, when she uses her Whitelighter powers to enhance the healing abilities of her own Whitelighter, Leo Wyatt, to fully heal the half-demon Cole Turner. Later in that season, Paige is able to channel Leo&#x27;s healing powers to heal him of his wounds after he has been poisoned by a Darklighter&#x27;s arrow. However, it is not until the season eight episode &quot;Payback&#x27;s a Witch&quot; that Paige develops the trigger to be able to heal on her own. After expressing her love discreetly for wounded parole officer Henry Mitchell, Paige unlocks the emotional trigger of love to access her healing powers, which she later uses to heal Henry of his gunshot wound. Like all Whitelighters before her, Paige can only use her healing powers on humans and not animals or demons.

===Natural abilities===
Paige has proven to be a skilled painter and sketch artist, first introduced in the season four episode, &quot;Muse to My Ears&quot;. Paige also showcases her singing talents in the season five episode, &quot;Sense and Sense Ability&quot;. While she has limited training in physical combat, her fighting skills are proficient enough to best Billie in hand-to-hand combat in the season eight episode, &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot;.

==Reception and cultural impact==
Galen Adair of Wordandfilm.com described Paige as a &quot;kindhearted, goofy witch,&quot; while a writer for IGN called her &quot;voluptuous.&quot; CNN&#x27;s Joshua Levs characterised Paige as &quot;the lovable, secret, younger half-sister.&quot; In his review of the fourth season, Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk felt that Paige fits right in with the sisters and noted that her addition changed the character dynamics of Piper and Phoebe &quot;in a good way.&quot; In another review of the fourth season, Leigh H. Edwards of &quot;PopMatters&quot; added that the addition of Paige was &quot;contrived and clunky&quot;, but welcomed the idea of McGowan joining the show as a witch &quot;since she has major goth cred as Marilyn Manson&#x27;s former flame.&quot; DVD Verdict&#x27;s Cynthia Boris wrote that McGowan brought &quot;a youthfulness&quot; and &quot;a fresh viewer perspective&quot; to &quot;Charmed&quot;, further noting that &quot;fans have come to enjoy her presence on the show.&quot; Sara Paige and Rachel Hyland of &quot;Geek Speak&quot; magazine described Paige as &quot;snarky, compassionate and whimsical,&quot; and believed that &quot;McGowan was well-suited for the role.&quot; Professional wrestler Paige named herself after McGowan&#x27;s character.

A writer for MovieWeb praised McGowan&#x27;s performance for delivering a &quot;great and relatable character&quot;, noting that &quot;She gets all of Paige&#x27;s own quirks and emotions and the feel of adjusting to things down really well.&quot; The writer also felt that McGowan was a &quot;great casting choice&quot; for &quot;Charmed&quot;. Rob Lineberger of DVD Verdict commented on McGowan&#x27;s acting in the fifth season, noting that she &quot;clips off the end of every sentence, often growling more than annunciating her lines.&quot; Lineberger also added that &quot;McGowan&#x27;s impressive snarl&quot; was one of the reasons he enjoyed that season. In his review of the sixth season, Lineberger wrote that McGowan was &quot;still smoking hot.&quot; BuzzFeed&#x27;s Jarett Wieselman commented on Paige&#x27;s outfits, noting that many of the episodes featured her, along with Phoebe, wearing &quot;a series of progressively revealing and ridiculous costumes in the name of vanquishing.&quot; Tariq Kyle of Hypable.com wrote that the funniest moment of &quot;Charmed&quot; was in the season four episode &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot;, when Paige&#x27;s breast size increased &quot;by a ridiculous amount.&quot;

At the 2001 Wand Awards, McGowan was nominated for Best New Cast Member for her portrayal of Paige. In 2005, she won Favorite Sister at the Family Television Awards. In 2007, AOL TV ranked Paige at number 12 on their list of Top TV Witches. The following year, she was ranked at number 13 on the same list. In his review of the television series &quot;Witches of East End&quot; being too similar to &quot;Charmed&quot;, Christian Cintron of Hollywood.com noted that Mädchen Amick&#x27;s &quot;snarky, sarcastic&quot; character Wendy Beauchamp &quot;channels Rose McGowan&#x27;s Paige Matthews.&quot;

<doc id="345231" wikidata="Q1750877" url="?curid=345231" title="Prue Halliwell">
<text>Prudence Halliwell is a fictional character from the American television series &quot;Charmed&quot;, played by Shannen Doherty from October 7, 1998, until May 17, 2001. She is the eldest daughter of Patty Halliwell and Victor Bennett. The character was created by Constance M. Burge, who based Prue on her older sister. Prue is introduced into the series as the eldest sister to Piper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano). She is one of the first original featured leads and more specifically, a Charmed Oneone of the most powerful witches of all time. Prue initially possesses the power to move objects with her mind by channeling telekinesis through her eyes. As the series progresses, she learns how to channel her telekinesis through her hands and gains the power of astral projection, the ability to be in two places at once. Prue also develops martial arts skills and becomes an effective hand-to-hand fighter like Phoebe.

Prue is portrayed as the oldest, responsible, strong, &quot;kick-ass sister&quot; and &quot;leader of the group.&quot; During her three seasons on &quot;Charmed&quot;, she is regarded as the strongest and most powerful witch of the Halliwell sisters. Prue&#x27;s storylines have mostly revolved around her protecting innocents and defeating the forces of evil in San Francisco with her sisters, as well as leading a normal life as an appraiser for an auction house and later as a professional photographer for a magazine company. She also has romantic relationships with her old high school flame Inspector Andy Trudeau (Ted King) in season one, and fellow auction house employee Jack Sheridan (Lochlyn Munro) in season two. In the third season, Prue is forced to marry the warlock Zile (Tom O&#x27;Brien) in a dark marriage ceremony, but their marriage soon ends after he is vanquished. In the season three finale &quot;All Hell Breaks Loose&quot;, Prue is attacked by Shax, a powerful demonic assassin sent by The Source of All Evil, ending the season on a cliffhanger. After Doherty departed the series, this attack was revealed to be fatal. She was replaced in season four by Rose McGowan, who played the long-lost younger half-sister Paige Matthews.

The character received a positive reception from television critics, who praised her strong persona and Doherty&#x27;s performance. Doherty received two Saturn Award nominations in 1999 and 2000, for Best Actress on Television for her portrayal of Prue. In 2007, AOL TV ranked Prue at number nine on their list of the Top TV Witches. In addition to the television series, the character has also appeared in numerous expanded universe material, such as the &quot;Charmed&quot; novels and its comic book adaptation.

==Casting and development==
In 1998, The WB began searching for a drama series, and looked to Spelling Television, which had produced the network&#x27;s most successful series &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, to create it. Expanding on the popularity of supernatural-themed dramas, the production company explored forms of mythology to find mythological characters they could focus on with contemporary storytelling. In order to create the series, Constance M. Burge was hired as the creator as she was under contract with 20th Century Fox and Spelling Television after conceiving the drama &quot;Savannah&quot;.

The character of Prue Halliwell was conceived by Burge, who wrote the pilot script for &quot;Charmed&quot;. The pilot script was based around three mismatched sisters who are initially based on Burge and her two older sisters, Laura and Edie Burge. Prue is based on Burge&#x27;s older sister Laura. On creating Prue, Burge stated &quot;my older sister, Laura, is very strong, very driven and so I attributed the characteristics that my sister Laura has to the character Prue.&quot; Executive producer Brad Kern claimed Prue was written into the series as &quot;the older sister, the kick-ass sister. She was the tough one. She was probably the most skeptical about the magic up top, but ultimately became the most powerful of [the sisters].&quot; Doherty stated that the character &quot;had a sense of responsibility that she felt towards her family and she was very nurturing and maternal and giving&quot;.

When the series was in its first development stages, executive producer Aaron Spelling had always known who he wanted for the role of Prue: Shannen Doherty, an actress from a previous Spelling Television series, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Doherty, already devoted to the project, pitched the idea to her best friend, former &quot;Picket Fences&quot; actress Holly Marie Combs, whom she and Spelling wanted for the role of Piper Halliwell. Doherty played the role of Prue in a 28-minute test pilot (the &quot;unaired pilot&quot;, never aired on television) alongside Combs and actress Lori Rom, who played the youngest sister Phoebe Halliwell. Rom quit the series and a new pilot was filmed with former &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; actress Alyssa Milano, who took over the role of Phoebe.

==Departure==
In May 2001, it was officially announced that Doherty would be departing &quot;Charmed&quot;. Following the announcement, rumors circulated that the reason behind Doherty&#x27;s departure was because of a feud with Milano. Doherty told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; that &quot;there was too much drama on the set and not enough passion for the work&quot;, and that there were never any problems between her and Combs. During an interview on &quot;Watch What Happens Live&quot; in 2013, Milano spoke about the rumored feud between her and Doherty, after a caller asked for the truth behind Doherty&#x27;s departure. Milano said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if she got fired, we never really found out what happened. I can tell you that we were on the air with her for three years and there were definitely some rough days. Holly and Shannen were best friends for like 10 years before the show started so it was very much sort of like high school. I would hope that in our thirties it wouldn&#x27;t feel like that anymore.&quot;

The producers originally considered recasting the role of Prue with a different actress. Actresses Soleil Moon Frye, Irene Molloy and Denise Richards were rumored to be possible replacements. Spelling even approached Tiffani Thiessen, who replaced Doherty on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, and Jennifer Love Hewitt. However, both Thiessen and Hewitt declined the role. Producers then decided to kill off Prue and replace her with a long-lost younger half-sister named Paige Matthews (played by Rose McGowan), in favor of having &quot;a fresh face&quot; join the series. The producers had to re-cut the season three cliffhanger to explain Prue&#x27;s sudden disappearance. Following Doherty&#x27;s departure from the series, all photographs of Prue in the Halliwell sisters&#x27; home were never seen again and she never appeared in any flashback scenes. In an interview with TVLine marking the ten year anniversary of the series finale, executive producer Brad Kern said that he &quot;tried like crazy to get her in flashbacks and to have photographs of her on the walls,&quot; but they could not afford to pay Doherty per-episode fee to use her image. Kern said that he regrets not being able to include a photo of Prue in the series finale&#x27;s final montage, but added it would have been &quot;impossible to accomplish&quot; because &quot;it was going to cost us a lot of money.&quot; Doherty revealed that she was asked to return for the series finale, but she declined the offer as she did not like the way the producers wanted to bring Prue back, stating it was &quot;just not authentic&quot;, &quot;nothing interesting or good&quot;, not &quot;true to the character&quot;, and that &quot;it didn&#x27;t feel right.&quot; On such a return of hers, she stated that &quot;the idea was floated by her&quot;. However, Kern commented that &quot;there was no talk about bringing [Doherty] back physically&quot; because they did not believe she would ever return or that the network would want her to. Kern felt that Doherty would not have returned because &quot;there were a lot of internal issues that led up to her leaving...on a lot of different people&#x27;s sides.&quot;

==Appearances==
===Television===

Prue is depicted as the eldest Halliwell sister on &quot;Charmed&quot;, portrayed by Shannen Doherty in the first 66 episodes of the series as well as the unaired pilot. At the start of season one (1998–99), six months have passed since the death of her grandmother, Penny Halliwell (Jennifer Rhodes). After ending her engagement to Roger (Matthew Ashford), Prue moves back into her family&#x27;s Victorian Manor with her middle sister Piper (Holly Marie Combs), and they are later joined by their youngest sister Phoebe (Alyssa Milano). On the night of Phoebe&#x27;s return, she finds a book called the &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; within the Manor&#x27;s attic. After Phoebe unknowingly recites aloud what turns out to be an incantation from the book, the three sisters each receive a magical power and discover their destiny as The Charmed Ones – the most powerful good witches the world has ever known. Gaining the power to &quot;move things with her mind&quot;, Prue battles with maintaining control of her newfound powers and keeping her identity as a witch secret.

Due to the magical interferences in both her work and personal life, Prue finds it difficult to rekindle a relationship with her old high school flame Inspector Andy Trudeau (T.W. King) and stay on top of her new job as an appraiser for Buckland&#x27;s Auction House. Throughout the first season, Prue and her sisters face off against various warlocks and demons who aim to steal their powers or harm innocents. In the first-season finale, Andy is killed trying protect her from a demonic foe.

The show&#x27;s second season (1999–2000) opens with Prue&#x27;s continual struggle to deal with Andy&#x27;s death. Prue feels responsible, and contemplates giving up on witchcraft entirely, but eventually decides to continue her destiny as a witch and protector of the innocent with help from her sisters. Prue later experiences growth in her magical abilities when she develops the power to &quot;be in two places at once&quot; via Astral Projection, and learns to open herself up to the potential of love again through a courtship with fellow Buckland&#x27;s employee Jack Sheridan (Lochlyn Munro) and a romantic fling with ex-con Bane Jessup (Antonio Sabato, Jr.). She eventually quits her job at Buckland&#x27;s to pursue her lifelong dream of being a professional photographer. Prue subsequently gets a job as a photographer for &quot;415 Magazine&quot;. In the season two finale, Prue and her sisters discover that the many attacks on their lives by evil beings have been orchestrated by a demonic force known as The Council.

By season three (2000–01), learning of the new evil The Triad (who have replaced The Council), Prue becomes determined to prepare herself for any further attacks of evil on herself, her sisters and any future innocents in which to protect. Throughout the season Prue displays martial arts skills, strengthening her powers and researching, finding and destroying demons. Her fight and devotion as a Charmed One and fulfilling their destiny results in her becoming what has been coined as a &quot;SuperWitch&quot;. Prue and her sisters eventually learn that the demon Belthazor and The Triad work for an even greater evil, The Source of All Evil, the leader of the demonic realm known as The Underworld. After Prue and Piper later discover that Cole Turner (Julian McMahon), who is actually Belthazor, faked his death with Phoebe&#x27;s help, the revelation causes a rift in their sisterly relationship. Later, after being forced to marry the warlock, Zile (Tom O&#x27;Brien) in a dark marriage ceremony, Prue comes to understand Phoebe&#x27;s draw to Cole&#x27;s darker half. While the two sisters mend their relationship, Prue distrusts Cole for some time. Midway through season three, Prue also makes amends with her estranged father, Victor Bennett (James Read) who left the family shortly after their mother&#x27;s death.

During the season three finale, Prue and Piper unwittingly expose themselves as witches to the world after being caught on camera by a local news crew fighting with The Source&#x27;s personal assassin Shax. In the aftermath of the exposure, Piper is shot by a crazed Wiccan fanatic who wanted to join the sisters&#x27; coven. Prue frantically tries to get Piper to a hospital, but is thwarted by the crowd of media in her way. Prue disregards the laws of magic and uses her powers against everyone in her way to save her sister&#x27;s life. Prue gets Piper to a hospital bed where Piper tells her she&#x27;s &quot;so cold&quot;, and dies in Prue&#x27;s arms. Prue, overcome with grief and rage, uses her powers and fighting skills to hold off a S.W.A.T. team attempting to take her down. Cradling her sister&#x27;s body, she promises to &quot;fix&quot; her death.

In order to save her sister&#x27;s life, Prue orders Piper&#x27;s husband Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause) to find Phoebe and pass on a deal to The Source to turn back time. This would reset the exposure of magic and undo Piper&#x27;s death. The Source agrees, knowing that he plans to double cross her in the end as Phoebe will be immune to the time reset while in The Underworld. In the end, Phoebe will not be able to warn her sisters&#x27; of the assassin&#x27;s attack and he will kill her himself. Time is reversed to the sisters&#x27; first encounter with Shax. However, Phoebe no longer answers when Prue calls for help, as she was never sent back in time. The season ends on a cliffhanger with Piper and Prue left for dead after losing in the fight against Shax. Meanwhile, Phoebe remains trapped in The Underworld.

In the premiere of season four (2001–02) &quot;Charmed Again (Part 1)&quot;, it is revealed that Prue could not be saved in time from the fatal wounds she suffered at Shax&#x27;s hands in the season three finale. Although the character is never shown again, Piper attempts numerous spells to resurrect Prue to no avail, and when she comes into contact with their grandmother, it is revealed that Prue is still struggling to adjust to being in the afterlife and that she is being helped to process her death by both Penny and the girls&#x27; mother Patty Halliwell (Finola Hughes). Penny also reveals to Piper that Prue cannot be summoned back to Earth because seeing Prue would not allow the sisters to grieve and finally move on. After going through phases of anger, denial, and depression, Piper accepts that Prue is really gone, and attends her funeral. This results in Phoebe having a premonition to save a young girl at the funeral and later discovering her identity as their younger half-sister Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan), a love child between their mother and her whitelighter, who was kept secret because of her whitelighter heritage. With the addition of Paige, Piper and Phoebe are able to reconstitute the Power of Three and avenge Prue&#x27;s death in vanquishing Shax.

Also this season, the new Power of Three call on Prue&#x27;s spirit to twice vanquish The Source – both in his original incarnation and that of his next incarnation, Cole. In the fifth season (2002–03), Prue is briefly seen when Phoebe and Paige visit the past memory of Piper&#x27;s wedding. However, Prue&#x27;s face is never shown and only her back is seen due to copyright laws regarding Doherty&#x27;s image. During the seventh season (2004–05) finale, it is revealed that after being asked for help from her sisters, Prue had taught Leo how to use astral projection despite being &quot;really protective of it&quot;. Piper, Phoebe and Paige later utilize the power of astral projection to defeat the threat of the demon Zankou (Oded Fehr). This is indicated by Piper stating &quot;Thank you Prue,&quot; once Piper, Phoebe and Paige reflect on the successful attack. The season then ends with Manor door being shut by a telekinetic force, implying Prue closed it from the afterlife.

===Literature===

As one of the central characters of the series, Prue appears extensively in &quot;Charmed&quot; literature. These appearances are most prominent in the first 10 books of the series of novels. The novels follow no strict continuity with the series or each other, and are often considered to be non-canon. However, the television series producers have final approval of everything in the novels, which could indicate the literature fitting into the established canon of the series and the so-called &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot; universe&quot;. Prue&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Charmed&quot; literature takes place within the novel &quot;The Power of Three&quot; by Eliza Willard on November 1, 1999, which acts as a novelised version of the series&#x27; premiere episode, &quot;Something Wicca This Way Comes&quot;. Her last appearance in a &quot;Charmed&quot; novel takes place within &quot;Beware What You Wish&quot; by Diana G. Gallagher on July 31, 2001.

In 2010, &quot;Charmed&quot; gained an officially licensed continuation in the form of a comic book, which is often billed as &quot;&quot;. The series is published monthly by Zenescope Entertainment. While Shannen Doherty&#x27;s image of Prue has yet to actually be seen in the comics, the character is seen as another person after taking over their body. In the twelfth issue of the comic, &quot;The Charmed Offensive&quot;, seven years after Prue&#x27;s death, Penny Halliwell informs the sisters that Prue has reincarnated into her next life, as her destiny was not completed when she died. However, it is later revealed in the issue that Penny had lied to the girls, mainly because she has no idea where Prue is. Later, Penny and her daughter Patty Halliwell task Cole to locate the missing Prue in exchange for helping him find peace in the afterlife. In the sixteenth issue of the comic, Cole finds her in Salem as another witch named Patience. In the seventeenth issue of the comics, Paige looks for a witch named Sarah at a Salem house; however, she meets Cole who won&#x27;t let her in. Despite his pleas, she orbs into the house where she meets Patience (Prue) and the two touch causing their powers to send them away. After recovering, Patience tells Paige that she is Prue. At first, Paige doesn&#x27;t believe her, but they go to the manor where after seven years, Prue, Piper, and Phoebe are finally reunited with a hug.

In spite of the reunion, Prue&#x27;s presence causes the sisters&#x27; powers to go haywire. Because the Charmed prophecy never spoke of a &quot;Power of Four&quot;, the reunion of the four sisters causes their individual and collective powers to go out of control. To diffuse the chaos brought upon by the presence of the four sisters, Paige volunteers to relinquish her powers so that Prue can rejoin her sisters in the &quot;Power of Three&quot;. Cole, however, steps in and informs Prue that the real reason she remained tied to the &quot;Power of Three&quot; and unable to move on in the afterlife was because she refused to truly let go of her destiny with her sisters. Realizing that her time as a Charmed One has passed, as she no longer inhabits the body of a true Warren witch, Prue instead surrenders her Warren powers so that Paige will be the only sister with the power to move things with her mind. Despite losing her active powers, Prue retains her status as witch and keeps the basic witch powers that allow her to cast spells and brew potions. Prue later returns to Salem, Massachusetts with Cole, who will help her train new witches to atone for his evil past.

==Powers and abilities==
===Magical powers===
In &quot;Charmed&quot; it is revealed that magical witches can develop and master a variety of magical skills and powers which include scrying, spell casting, and brewing potent potions. As a magical witch, Prue can utilize scrying, a divination art form that allows one to locate a missing object or person. Prue can also cast spells, often written in iambic pentameter or as a rhyming couplet, to influence others or the world around her. She can also brew potions, most often used to vanquish foes or to achieve other magical feats similar to the effects of a spell. Prue also possesses the powers of telekinesis and astral projection; however, in the comic book continuation, she chooses to lose these abilities because her and Paige&#x27;s co-existence is unbalancing the Power of Three. Prue was also often described as the most powerful of the Charmed Ones.

====Telekinesis====
At the start of the series, it is revealed that Prue has the power to move objects and people with her mind using telekinesis. While Prue&#x27;s telekinetic powers work best with a direct line of sight, she appears to simply need only an intimate knowledge of the object&#x27;s location in order to manipulate its movement. For instance, in the pilot episode, &quot;Something Wicca This Way Comes&quot;, Prue is able to move the ink from her ex-fiancée Roger&#x27;s pen, although it is mostly concealed in his shirt pocket. Later, while outside Roger&#x27;s office, she curls her fingers in anger, which causes Roger&#x27;s tie to tighten its hold around his neck. In the same episode, Prue also displays telematerialization as a second method for which she can move objects with her mind. After Prue telekinetically slides a creamer container towards her from across the bar in frustration, she proceeds to transfer a portion of the cream from its container by telematerializing the cream directly into her coffee without it going through the air or space between. The series premiere is the only instance in which Prue displays teleportation powers on-screen; however, she later uses this power again in the comics.

In the &quot;Charmed&quot; series, certain magical powers are attached to emotional triggers, regardless, all powers can be affected by the user&#x27;s emotions. For Prue, the emotional trigger for her telekinesis is anger and frustration. This emotion is channeled to initially unlock and control her powers, which can only be focused by squinting her eyes for the majority of the first season. In episode nineteen of season one, &quot;Out of Sight&quot;, Prue learns how to channel her telekinesis through her hands as well. Later in the series, she obtains enough control over her powers in order to move objects with a mere crook or twitch of a single finger. The limits of Prue&#x27;s telekinetic powers are unclear, but she appears to be able to move up to 400 pounds (181.4 kg) with her mind, sufficient to lift and throw two normal-sized adults with her powers.

In the season two episode &quot;Morality Bites&quot;, Prue travels ten years into the future from the year 1999 and inhabits her future self&#x27;s body. In the episode, Prue discovers that in ten years time from 1999, her telekinesis becomes several times stronger when she telekinetically blasts out an entire wall of the attic with one swift hand gesture. After returning to the present, Prue never realizes the growth of this level of power before her death at the end of the third season. However, in the comics, after possessing the body of Patience, Prue&#x27;s telekinetic powers did evolve to an advanced level — she was able to lift a car with her mind, levitate a chalk drawing off its surface, and even manipulate the chalk drawing to the extent where it exploded. She was even able to telekinetically hold her half-sister Paige in place and the latter admitted that she couldn&#x27;t orb out of this.

====Astral Projection====
In the season two episode &quot;Ms. Hellfire&quot;, Prue&#x27;s powers expand allowing her to move her body to another location in the form of astral projection. This power developed from an intense desire to be in two places at once. While astrally projecting, Prue&#x27;s physical body falls unconscious while her astral body appears in a new location in corporeal form. Unlike traditional astral projection, &#x27;Astral Prue&#x27; is able to interact with the physical world. Prue displays the ability to astrally project across vast distances, regardless of her lack of familiarity with the location she is projecting to. However, she never displays the ability to astrally project across worlds. It is also revealed that Prue is unable to access her power of telekinesis while she is astrally projecting. In season three of the series, it is revealed that injuries sustained by Prue will not appear on her astral body. In the season three episode &quot;Primrose Empath&quot;, after Prue is temporarily cursed with the power of empathy, she channels the emotions she feels to enhance her own magical powers, which enable her to astrally project emotions into other people as well as briefly utilize her astral and physical bodies at the same time.

===Other abilities===
During her time on the series, Prue displays an efficiency in the Latin language and displays an expertise on various artifacts from a number of art forms and cultures throughout history. In season two, Prue begins taking classes in self-defense with her sister Phoebe. She gradually becomes an effective hand-to-hand fighter with her skills on par with Phoebe&#x27;s. Her skills in hand-to-hand combat advanced to the point where Prue is capable of besting multiple adversaries in season three, most notably demonic wrestlers, the demon Vinceres, vampire-like demons known as Seekers, and two S.W.A.T. team members. Prue is also skilled in the art of photography, which she later turns into her full-time profession.

==Death count==
During the run of the series and her life as a Charmed One, Prue died three times.


==Reception==
In 1999, Doherty was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television for her portrayal of Prue. She received the same nomination the following year. Doherty and Milano&#x27;s rumored off-screen feud earned them a nomination for Best Fight at the 2001 Wand Awards.

Terry Kelleher of &quot;People&quot; magazine labeled Prue &quot;the serious one&quot; out of the three Halliwell sisters. Michael Abernethy of &quot;PopMatters&quot; described Prue as &quot;pragmatic&quot; and noted that Doherty&#x27;s performance in &quot;Charmed&quot; had &quot;the hard edge&quot; that was seen in her previous roles, further adding that she had &quot;matured from a bitchy teenager into an assertive confident woman.&quot; Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented that Doherty&#x27;s presence on the show was one of the main things that made it interesting, writing &quot;Perennially crabby, delivering her lines as if she has contempt for them...curt, cranky Doherty gives &quot;Charmed&quot; its kick.&quot; &quot;Newsday&quot;″s Steve Parks wrote that Doherty being cast as a witch was a &quot;perfect&quot; idea, due to her rumored poor off-screen behaviour. Kristin Sample of AOL TV felt that Prue had the &quot;best powers&quot; and was &quot;the bitchiest&quot; witch out of the three sisters, further adding that Doherty &quot;quite possibly could be a real life witch.&quot; In his review of the pilot episode, Rob Owen of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; commented that &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot; is Doherty&#x27;s show plain and simple. Her behaviour on and off screen may not always be charming, but she excels at this sort of formidable, prickly character.&quot; CNN&#x27;s Joshua Levs named Prue the &quot;uber-responsible older sister&quot; and felt that Doherty made her &quot;somewhat plausible.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Kate Ward added that she &quot;gained an appreciation&quot; for Doherty after seeing her on &quot;Charmed&quot;, writing &quot;Despite omnipresent rumors of her poor off-screen behavior, it&#x27;s been difficult for me to think of Doherty as anything but charming.&quot; In her review of the first season, Karyn L. Barr of the same publication wrote that Prue was one of the reasons it was &quot;spellbinding&quot;. Rachel Day of &quot;Geek Speak&quot; praised Doherty&#x27;s acting on &quot;Charmed&quot; and wrote that she deserved her two Saturn Award nominations. Day noted that Doherty&#x27;s &quot;particularly outstanding&quot; performances were in the season two episodes &quot;Witch Trial&quot; and &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Luck&quot;. SpoilerTV&#x27;s Gavin Hetherington named Prue &quot;one of television&#x27;s most influential witches&quot; and wrote that her death in the season three finale was &quot;one of the best in television history&quot; that &quot;forever changed the course of the show.&quot; Angelica Bastien of &quot;Bustle&quot; called Prue &quot;the superior sister&quot; and added that she preferred the show&#x27;s first three seasons as she felt &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot; got pretty bad&quot; in the seasons after Prue died. Brett Cullum of DVD Verdict wrote that Prue was &quot;the pragmatic no-nonsense leader of the group&quot; during the first three seasons and she was &quot;never afraid to lay down the law.&quot; He further added, &quot;Not only was Shannen a pretty good witch, but nobody gives good bitch quite like her. She&#x27;s infamous for being hard to work with, but she&#x27;s got a charisma the show needed. She knew how to make Prudence strong and vulnerable all at once, and they relied on her to be the wise leader who put her fist down when necessary.&quot; Hugh Armitage of Digital Spy felt that &quot;Prue&#x27;s death was handled badly&quot;, further adding that &quot;it never made sense that she would vanish&quot; from the show completely, as &quot;Prue never showed up in spirit form&quot; and was not featured in any photographs displayed in the sisters&#x27; home.

==Cultural impact==
In 2007, AOL TV ranked Prue at number 9 on their list of Top TV Witches. The following year, she was ranked at number 10 on the same list. Prue was included in TVLine&#x27;s list of &quot;Shocking TV Deaths&quot;, while &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine included her in their list of favourite witches from TV. Prue&#x27;s death was included on io9&#x27;s list of the &quot;Top 10 Most Shocking TV Deaths&quot;, with Meredith Woerner stating that her permanent death was shocking considering the show&#x27;s light-hearted tone and forever changed the family dynamic.

Doherty and her character have been referenced in television shows and films due to her portrayal as a witch in &quot;Charmed&quot;. In the 2000 parody film, &quot;Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth&quot;, Barbara Primesuspect (Julie Benz) is said to be yelling &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot; my ass!&quot; at Doherty, who does not appear on-screen. In an episode of the teen comedy-drama series &quot;Popular&quot;, entitled &quot;The Shocking Possession of Harrison John&quot;, Josh Ford (Bryce Johnson) asks George Austin (Anthony Montgomery) who is Michael Bernardino&#x27;s (Ron Lester) &quot;favorite hottie witch&quot; on &quot;Charmed&quot; and George says it is Prue. In the episode &quot;Cursed&quot; of sitcom &quot;So Notorious&quot;, Tori Spelling and Sasan (Zachary Quinto) discuss who has put a curse on her and Sasan says, &quot;It&#x27;s Shannen! She knows all that witchcraft from &quot;Charmed&quot;.&quot; The reference in &quot;So Notorious&quot; was meant as a joke to Doherty&#x27;s rumored poor off-screen behavior when she and Spelling both starred together in &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. In his review of the television series &quot;Witches of East End&quot; being too similar to &quot;Charmed&quot;, Christian Cintron of Hollywood.com noted that Julia Ormond&#x27;s character Joanna Beauchamp seemed &quot;a lot like...Doherty&#x27;s type-A character, Prue.&quot;

<text>Lassen Volcanic National Park is a national park of the United States in northeastern California. The dominant feature of the park is Lassen Peak, the largest plug dome volcano in the world and the southernmost volcano in the Cascade Range. Lassen Volcanic National Park is one of the few areas in the world where all four types of volcanoes can be found: plug dome, shield, cinder cone, and stratovolcano.

The source of heat for the volcanism in the Lassen area is subduction of the Gorda Plate diving below the North American Plate off the Northern California coast. The area surrounding Lassen Peak is still active with boiling mud pots, fumaroles, and hot springs.

Lassen Volcanic National Park started as two separate national monuments designated by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1907: Cinder Cone National Monument and Lassen Peak National Monument. Starting in May 1914 and lasting until 1917, a series of minor to major eruptions occurred on Lassen. Because of the eruptive activity and the area&#x27;s stark volcanic beauty, Lassen Peak, Cinder Cone, and the area surrounding were established as a National Park on August 9, 1916.

==History==
The Atsugewi have inhabited the area since long before white settlers first saw Lassen. They knew that the peak was full of fire and water and thought it would one day blow itself apart.

European immigrants in the mid-19th century used Lassen Peak as a landmark on their trek to the fertile Sacramento Valley. One of the guides to these immigrants was a Danish blacksmith named Peter Lassen, who settled in Northern California in the 1830s. Lassen Peak was named after him. Nobles Emigrant Trail was later cut through the park area and passed Cinder Cone and the Fantastic Lava Beds.

Inconsistent newspaper accounts reported by witnesses from 1850 to 1851 described seeing &quot;fire thrown to a terrible height&quot; and &quot;burning lava running down the sides&quot; in the area of Cinder Cone. As late as 1859, a witness reported seeing fire in the sky from a distance, attributing it to an eruption. Early geologists and volcanologists who studied the Cinder Cone concluded the last eruption occurred between 1675 and 1700. After the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) began reassessing the potential risk of other active volcanic areas in the Cascade Range. Further study of Cinder Cone estimated the last eruption occurred between 1630 and 1670. Recent tree-ring analysis has placed the date at 1666.

The Lassen area was first protected by being designated as the Lassen Peak Forest Preserve. Lassen Peak and Cinder Cone were later declared as U.S. National Monuments in May 1907 by President Theodore Roosevelt.

Starting in May 1914 and lasting until 1921, a series of minor to major eruptions occurred on Lassen. These events created a new crater, and released lava and a great deal of ash. Fortunately, because of warnings, no one was killed, but several houses along area creeks were destroyed. Because of the eruptive activity, which continued through 1917, and the area&#x27;s stark volcanic beauty, Lassen Peak, Cinder Cone and the area surrounding were declared a National Park on August 9, 1916.

The Main Park Road was constructed between 1925 and 1931, just 10 years after Lassen Peak erupted. Near Lassen Peak the road reaches , making it the highest road in the Cascade Mountains. It is not unusual for of snow to accumulate on the road near Lake Helen and for patches of snow to last into July.

In October 1972, a portion of the park was designated as Lassen Volcanic Wilderness by the US Congress (Public Law 92-511). The National Park Service seeks to manage the wilderness in keeping with the Wilderness Act of 1964, with minimal developed facilities, signage, and trails. The management plan of 2003 adds that, &quot;The wilderness experience offers a moderate to high degree of challenge and adventure.&quot;

In 1974, the National Park Service took the advice of the USGS and closed the visitor center and accommodations at Manzanita Lake. The Survey stated that these buildings would be in the way of a rockslide from Chaos Crags if an earthquake or eruption occurred in the area. An aging seismograph station remains. However, a campground, store, and museum dedicated to Benjamin F. Loomis stands near Manzanita Lake, welcoming visitors who enter the park from the northwest entrance.

After the Mount St. Helens eruption, the USGS intensified its monitoring of active and potentially active volcanoes in the Cascade Range. Monitoring of the Lassen area includes periodic measurements of ground deformation and volcanic-gas emissions and continuous transmission of data from a local network of nine seismometers to USGS offices in Menlo Park, California. Should indications of a significant increase in volcanic activity be detected, the USGS will immediately deploy scientists and specially designed portable monitoring instruments to evaluate the threat. In addition, the National Park Service (NPS) has developed an emergency response plan that would be activated to protect the public in the event of an impending eruption.

A downhill skiing site operating in the area was closed in 1992. The last remaining part was the Lassen Chalet, located near the southwest entrance, which was finally demolished in 2005. The new Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center opened to the public at the same location in 2008. It was so named after the Mountain Maidu name for Lassen Peak.

In 2021, the Dixie Fire burned large portions of the National Park, becoming the largest wildfire in park history. On August 5, 2021, the fire entered Lassen Volcanic National Park near Juniper Lake and the entire park was closed for safety. The town of Mineral, including park headquarters, was forced to evacuate. Structure loss occurred at the Drakesbad Guest Ranch and at cabins near Juniper Lake. The Dixie Fire&#x27;s advance northward was slowed by the 2012 Reading Fire footprint, but the Dixie Fire ultimately burned 73,240 acres within the park—approximately 69% of the park&#x27;s total area. 12,845 acres, or 18% of that area, burned at a severity that left the landscape unchanged. 34,450 acres, or 49% of the burned area in the park, burned at a low-to-moderate severity. The remaining 23,493 acres, or 33% of the area burned by the Dixie Fire in Lassen Volcanic National Park, burned at a high severity.

The NPS tracks Lassen visitors by counting vehicles entering the park via in-road inductive loops at all vehicle entrances. Buses and other non-reportable vehicles are subtracted from the vehicle count, which is then multiplied by three, an estimate of the number of visitors per vehicle.

==Geography and geology==

The park is located near the northern end of the Sacramento Valley, near the cities of Redding and Susanville. It is located in portions of Shasta, Lassen, Plumas, and Tehama counties.

The western part of the park features great lava pinnacles (huge mountains created by lava flows), jagged craters, and steaming sulfur vents. It is cut by glaciated canyons and is dotted and threaded by lakes and rushing clear streams.

The eastern part of the park is a vast lava plateau more than one mile (1.6 km) above sea level. Here, small cinder cones are found (Fairfield Peak, Hat Mountain, and Crater Butte). Forested with pine and fir, this area is studded with small lakes, but it boasts few streams. Warner Valley, marking the southern edge of the Lassen Plateau, features hot spring areas (Boiling Springs Lake, Devils Kitchen, and Terminal Geyser). This forested, steep valley also has large meadows that have wildflowers in spring.

Lassen Peak is made of dacite, an igneous rock, and is one of the world&#x27;s largest plug dome volcanoes. It is also the southernmost non-extinct volcano of the Cascade Range (specifically, the Shasta Cascade part of the range). The tall volcano sits on the north-east flank of the remains of Mount Tehama, a stratovolcano that was a thousand feet (305 m) higher than Lassen and wide at its base. After emptying its throat and partially doing the same to its magma chamber in a series of eruptions, Tehama either collapsed into itself and formed a two-mile (3.2 km) wide caldera in the late Pleistocene or was simply eroded away with the help of acidic vapors that loosened and broke the rock, which was later carried away by glaciers.

Sulphur Works is a geothermal area in between Lassen Peak and Brokeoff Mountain that is thought to mark an area near the center of Tehama&#x27;s now-gone cone. Other geothermal areas in the caldera are Little Hot Springs Valley, Diamond Point (an old lava conduit), and Bumpass Hell (see Geothermal areas in Lassen Volcanic National Park).

The magma that fuels the volcanoes in the park is derived from subduction off the coast of Northern California. Cinder Cone and the Fantastic Lava Beds, located about northeast of Lassen Peak, is a cinder cone volcano and associated lava flow field that last erupted about 1650. It created a series of basaltic andesite to andesite lava flows known as the Fantastic Lava Beds.

There are four shield volcanoes in the park; Mount Harkness (southwest corner of the park), Red Mountain (at south-central boundary), Prospect Peak (in northeast corner), and Raker Peak (north of Lassen Peak). All of these volcanoes are 7,000–8,400 feet (2,133–2,560 m) above sea level and each is topped by a cinder cone volcano.

During ice ages, glaciers have modified and helped to erode the older volcanoes in the park. The center of snow accumulation and therefore ice radiation was Lassen Peak, Red Mountain, and Raker Peak. These volcanoes thus show more glacial scarring than other volcanoes in the park.

Despite not having any glaciers currently, Lassen Peak does have 14 permanent snowfields.
=== Access ===
The park is accessible via State Routes 89 and 44. SR 89 passes north–south through the park, beginning at SR 36 to the south and ending at SR 44 to the north. SR 89 passes immediately adjacent to the base of Lassen Peak. There are five vehicle entrances to the park: the north and south entrances on SR 89; and unpaved roads entering at Drakesbad and Juniper Lake in the south, and at Butte Lake in the northeast. The park can also be accessed by trails leading in from the Caribou Wilderness to the east, as well as the Pacific Crest Trail, and two smaller trails leading in from Willow Lake and Little Willow Lake to the south.

The segment of SR 89 through the park is typically closed during the winter due to very heavy snowfall and snowpack.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Lassen Volcanic National Park has a Mediterranean-influenced warm-summer Humid continental climate (&quot;Dsb&quot;). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center at elevation is 6b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of .

Since the entire park is located at medium to high elevations, the park generally has cool-cold winters and warm summers below . Above this elevation, the climate is harsh and cold, with cool summer temperatures. Precipitation within the park is high to very high due to a lack of a rain shadow from the Coast Ranges. The park gets more precipitation than anywhere else in the Cascades south of the Three Sisters. Snowfall at the new visitor center near the southwest entrance at is around despite facing east. Up around Lake Helen, at the snowfall is around , making it probably the snowiest place in California. In addition, Lake Helen gets more average snow accumulation than any other recording station located near a volcano in the Cascade range, with a maximum of . Snowbanks persist year-round.

==Plants==

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Lassen Volcanic National Park has a red fir, &quot;Abies magnifica&quot; (&quot;7&quot;) potential vegetation type with a California Conifer Forest (&quot;2&quot;) potential vegetation form.

Lying at the northern end of the Sierra Nevada forests ecoregion, Lassen Volcanic National Park preserves a landscape nearly as it existed before Euro-American settlement: its of old growth include all of its major forest types.

At elevations below 6,500 feet the dominant vegetation community is the mixed conifer forest. ponderosa and Jeffrey pines, sugar pine, and white fir form the forest canopy for this rich community that also includes species of manzanita, gooseberry, and &quot;Ceanothus&quot;. Common wildflowers include iris, spotted coralroot, pyrola, violets, and lupin.

Above the mixed-conifer forest is the major community of the red fir forest. Between elevations of 6,500 and 8,000 feet, red fir, western white pine, mountain hemlock, and lodgepole pine dominate a community less diverse than the mixed-conifer forest. Common plants include satin lupine, woolly mule&#x27;s-ears and pinemat manzanita.

Subalpine areas include the upper limit for the growth of standing trees. From 8,000 feet to treeline, plants are fewer in overall number with exposed patches of bare ground providing a harsh environment. Rock spirea, lupin, Indian paintbrush, and penstemon are a few of the rugged members of this community. Trees in this community include whitebark pine and mountain hemlock.

==Wildlife==

Species that are typically found in these forested areas are black bear, red fox, mule deer, marten, cougar, brown creeper, a variety of chipmunk species, raccoon, mountain chickadee, pika, a variety of squirrel species, white-headed woodpecker, coyote, bobcat, weasel, a variety of mouse species, long-toed salamander, skunk, and a wide variety of bat species. Areas such as Reflection Lake attract waterfowl, including Canada geese, great blue heron, snowy egret, and kingfisher.

Lassen Volcanic Park is home to the Sierra Nevada red fox in particular, one of the rarest mammals in California. 20 individuals have been identified in the park, making it the largest known Sierra Nevada red fox population.

A repopulation of wolves in California began in late December 2011. A northwestern wolf pack originally from Oregon known as the &quot;Lassen Pack&quot; inhabits the forest surrounding this national park. Other residential California wolves are the &quot;Beckwourth&quot; and &quot;Whaleback&quot; packs. The &quot;Shasta&quot; pack, which formerly was in the forest near this park, no longer appears to be extant. In 2024, a pack consisting of a breeding pair and at least one offspring was reported within Lassen Volcanic Park by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The pack was likely formed by dispersing members from the Lassen Pack, which lives within Lassen County outside of the national park, and marks the first modern presence of wolves within the park itself.

==Geology==

===Formation of basement rocks===
In the Cenozoic, uplifting and westward tilting of the Sierra Nevada along with extensive volcanism generated huge lahars (volcanic-derived mud flows) in the Pliocene which became the Tuscan Formation. This formation is not exposed anywhere in the national park but it is just below the surface in many areas.

Also in the Pliocene, basaltic flows erupted from vents and fissures in the southern part of the park. These and later flows covered increasingly large areas and built a lava plateau. In the later Pliocene and into the Pleistocene, these basaltic flows were covered by successive thick and fluid flows of andesite lava, which geologists call the Juniper lavas and the Twin Lakes lavas. The Twin Lakes lava is black, porphyritic and has abundant xenocrysts of quartz (see Cinder Cone).

Another group of andesite lava flows called the Flatiron, erupted during this time and covered the southwestern part of the park&#x27;s area. The park by this time was a relatively featureless and large lava plain. Subsequently, the Eastern basalt flows erupted along the eastern boundary of what is now the park, forming low hills that were later eroded into rugged terrain.

===Volcanoes rise===

Pyroclastic eruptions then started to pile tephra into cones in the northern area of the park.

Mount Tehama (also known as Brokeoff Volcano) rose as a stratovolcano in the southwestern corner of the park during the Pleistocene. It was made of roughly alternating layers of andesitic lavas and tephra (volcanic ash, breccia, and pumice) with increasing amounts of tephra with elevation. At its height, Tehama was probably about high.

Approximately 350,000 years ago its cone collapsed into itself and formed a two-mile (3.2 km) wide caldera after it emptied its throat and partially did the same to its magma chamber in a series of eruptions. One of these eruptions occurred where Lassen Peak now stands, and consisted of fluid, black, glassy dacite, which formed a layer thick (outcroppings of which can be seen as columnar rock at Lassen&#x27;s base).

During glacial periods (ice ages) of the present Wisconsinan glaciation, glaciers have modified and helped to erode the older volcanoes in the park, including the remains of Tehama. Many of these glacial features, deposits and scars, however, have been covered up by tephra and avalanches, or were destroyed by eruptions.

Roughly 27,000 years ago (older data gave an age of 18,000 years), Lassen Peak started to form as a dacite lava dome quickly pushed its way through Tehama&#x27;s former north-eastern flank. As the lava dome pushed its way up, it shattered overlaying rock, which formed a blanket of talus around the emerging volcano. Lassen rose and reached its present height in a relatively short time, probably in as little as a few years. Lassen Peak has also been partially eroded by Ice Age glaciers, at least one of which extended as much as from the volcano itself.

Since then, smaller dacite domes formed around Lassen. The largest of these, Chaos Crags, is just north of Lassen Peak. Phreatic (steam explosion) eruptions, dacite and andesite lava flows and cinder cone formation have persisted into modern times.
There are active hot springs and mud pots in the Lassen area. Some of these springs are the site of occurrence of certain extremophile micro-organisms, that are capable of surviving in extremely hot environments.

<text>The Lassen volcanic area presents a geological record of sedimentation and volcanic activity in and around Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California, U.S. The park is located in the southernmost part of the Cascade Mountain Range in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Pacific Oceanic tectonic plates have plunged below the North American Plate in this part of North America for hundreds of millions of years. Heat and molten rock from these subducting plates has fed scores of volcanoes in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia over at least the past 30 million years, including these in the Lassen volcanic areas.

Between 3 and 4 million years ago, volcanic-derived mud flows called lahars streamed down several major mountains that included nearby but now extinct Mount Yana and Mount Maidu to become the Tuscan Formation. Basaltic and later andesitic to dacitic flows of lava covered increasingly larger areas of this formation to eventually form the lava plateau upon which the park is situated. About 600,000 years ago, Mount Tehama started to rise as a stratovolcano in the southwestern corner of the park, eventually reaching an estimated in height.

Roughly 27,000 years ago, a dacite lava dome quickly pushed its way through Tehama&#x27;s former north-eastern flank, becoming the approximately shorter Lassen Peak. Lassen&#x27;s shape was significantly altered by glacial erosion from 25,000 to 18,000 years ago during the Wisconsin glaciation. Since then, smaller dacite domes such as the 1,100-year-old Chaos Crags have formed around Lassen. Phreatic (steam explosion) eruptions, dacite and andesite lava flows along with cinder cone formation have persisted into modern times. Most notable of these is the eruption and formation of Cinder Cone in the mid- to late 17th century and the eruption of Lassen Peak in the early 20th century. The only activity since then has been the constant bubbling of mud pots and steaming of fumaroles from the various geothermal areas in Lassen Volcanic National Park. The potential exists for renewed vigorous volcanic activity that could threaten life and property in the area.

== Regional geologic setting ==
=== Current setting ===
The Lassen volcanic area lies at the southern extremity of the Cascade Range, which extends northward some from Lassen Peak within the park through Oregon and Washington and into British Columbia. Lassen Peak is one of the Cascade Volcanoes that form a segment of a ring of volcanoes that circle the Pacific Ocean known collectively as the &#x27;Pacific Ring of Fire&#x27;. All four types of volcanoes found in the world—shield, composite, cinder cone, and plug dome—are represented in Lassen Volcanic National Park.

The Cascade Volcanoes are fed by heat generated as the Gorda and Juan de Fuca tectonic plates are being subducted below the much larger but lighter North American Plate. Lying some offshore, the spreading center of the Gorda Plate pushes out about of new crust toward the coast of northernmost California and southern Oregon every year.

The composition of the molten rock (magma) that feeds volcanism in the Lassen volcanic area ranges widely in its content of silica or ; the higher the silica content, the greater the ability of the magma to trap and hold on to gas and water vapor. When high-silica (dacitic) magma rises to the Earth&#x27;s surface, the trapped gases and vapors can erupt explosively to produce ash clouds and pyroclastic flows that consist of superheated gas, ash and volcanic fragments. Dacite magma that is extruded nonexplosively as lava forms domes because it is too viscous (sticky) to flow far away from its source. Low-silica (basaltic) magma is more fluid and usually erupts as lava in less explosive eruptions than dacite because gas and water vapor escape easily from it. Eruptions of basalt magma typically produce elongate lava flows, as well as build cinder cones (piles of small frothy lava fragments or &#x27;cinders&#x27;) around volcanic vents.

Basaltic volcanism in the Lassen volcanic area occurs mainly along chains of vents aligned in a north or northwest direction, parallel to regional faults. Examples include Poison Buttes, Subglacial Buttes, Tumble Buttes, the Prospect Peak-Red Cinder area, the east side of the Hat Creek Valley and Potato Buttes-Sugarloaf area, and the Red Lake Mountain area. Prolonged basaltic volcanism at a single site can produce a sizeable edifice, like the broad, relatively flat shield volcanoes of Prospect Peak and Sifford Mountain. Unlike other Cascade volcanoes, Lassen&#x27;s large plug dome and composite volcanoes are in close proximity to the smaller cinder cone volcanoes that surround the volcanic center.

Northwest of the park lies the Klamath Mountains (a collective term for the Siskiyou, Trinity, Salmon and Marble mountain ranges). To the west lies the Sacramento Valley. Just south of the park begins the Sierra Nevada mountain range, and to the east lie the Modoc Plateau and then the Great Basin.

=== Geologic history of the region ===

All rock now exposed in the area of the park is volcanic, and unconformably overlies much older sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rock, which was formed during the hundreds of millions of years when the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, mud and limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity was associated with the mountain building.

About 70 million years ago, the area where the Cascade Range is now situated was under the most recent encroachment by the Pacific Ocean. The rocks that make up the modern Sierra Nevada and the Klamath Mountains were already in existence but deeply buried. Some 70 million years before (140 million years before present), the rocks that now make up the Klamaths broke away from the rocks that now make up the Sierras and moved west, leaving the flooded &#x27;Lassen Strait.&#x27; This broad depression was a seaway that connected the marine basin in California with that in east central Oregon.

The entire western portion of North America was being deformed from the Laramide orogeny starting around 70 million years ago. Gradually during millions of years, crustal rocks were folded and fractured and the seas driven away. This same bending and breaking of rocks relieved pressure on the hot material beneath the Earth&#x27;s crust and permitted magma to rise toward the surface. Volcanoes burst into activity starting 30 million years ago from Washington southward along the Cascades and in the area now occupied by the Sierra Nevada. This activity continued until approximately 11 or 12 million years ago. Lava and ash reached a thickness of up to in some areas, forming what is now known as the western Cascades. These have been eroded until they are now rolling hills. The northern end of the San Andreas Fault and the Mendocino triple junction have moved northward over time, and with them the southern margin of Cascade volcanism retreats north; it currently is located at the southern end of the Lassen national park. The extensional tectonics of the Basin and Range and the widespread fault system of the Walker Lane are also encroaching on the Lassen region and faults associated with them provide pathways for magma to reach the surface.

Meanwhile, toward the end of this activity, eruptions of a different kind took place on an unprecedented scale in eastern Oregon and Washington. From innumerable cracks, floods of highly fluid basaltic lava spread to cover an area of over . Now known as the Columbia Plateau, this great lava bed of flood basalt covers much of Oregon and Washington and even parts of Idaho. Northern California&#x27;s Modoc Plateau is a thinner basaltic flow which some geologists associate with the Columbia Plateau, but there are technical objections to this. The High Cascades took shape as a distinct mountain belt as a result of this upheaval and the bending of the thick blanket of volcanic rocks. During the next 10 million years, a series of new basaltic volcanic cones similar to the shield volcanoes now found in Hawaii were built.

== Formation of basement rocks ==
Between two and three million years ago, during the Pliocene, the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and tilted westward. A series of volcanic mudflows (lahars) from three major source areas contributed debris that covered almost to form the oldest distinctive geologic formation in the High Cascades. The resulting Tuscan Formation is not exposed anywhere in the national park but is just below the surface in many places within it. It consists mainly of tuffs but also contains conglomerates and lava sheets. The formation can reach thicknesses exceeding and is of late Pliocene age. An overlying rhyolitic lava flow gives an age of 1.5 million years.

Lassen is the fifth volcanic center to be active in the region. Latour, Yana, Maidu and Dittmar were the four preceding centers; Latour and Yana are only poorly known. One major source of the formation was Mount Yana; centered a few miles (5 km) southwest of Butt Mountain and south of the park. Mount Yana had probably reached its full size of in elevation and in diameter before Mount Maidu, the second source, had acquired half its growth. Mount Maidu, which eventually surpassed Mount Yana in size, was centered over what is now the town of Mineral, California, but has been extinct for hundreds of thousands of years (the grassy plain around the town is Maidu&#x27;s caldera). A third source situated north of Latour Butte made a lesser contribution to the formation. Minor sources included an area near Hatchet Mountain Pass (northwest of Burney Mountain), dikes south and southwest of Inskip Hill and possibly Campbell Mound (north of Chico, California).

Also during the Pliocene, basaltic lavas poured forth in the vicinity of Willow Lake in the southwestern portion of the park. These were followed by a very thick sequence of very fluid andesitic lavas which erupted near Juniper Lake and flowed westward about four miles (6 km). At about the same time, other andesitic lavas poured from several vents on the central plateau to cover an area of at least . Included among these flows were the Twin Lake lavas of black porphyritic andesite, which are notable in that they contain xenocrysts of quartz. The Flatiron andesites spread over the southwestern part of the park area around this time.

Somewhat later, andesitic lavas poured out from what is now Reading Peak and mainly flowed to the south and east, reaching the head of Warner Valley. By this time, the park&#x27;s eastern portion had been transformed into a relatively flat plain. The activity was followed by an eruption of the Eastern basalts from volcanoes east of the park. These thick flows have subsequently eroded to produce rugged hills that limit the park on the east. Taken together, these flows built the lava plateau upon which the Lassen volcanic area is located.

== Volcanoes rise and fall in the park area ==

=== Mount Tehama and pre-Lassen volcanics ===

The earliest volcanic activity of the Lassen Volcanic Center commenced 825,000 years ago. The Rockland complex formed between 825,000 and 609,000 years ago. It was the source of lava domes and lava flows of dacitic composition. Around 610,000 years ago over 130 km3 of rhyolite magma violently erupted onto the surface, producing massive pyroclastic flows and an ash plume several tens of kilometers high. This plume distributed ash almost entirely over the state of Nevada and sending traces as far as southeastern Idaho. As the eruption progressed the underlying magma chamber was severely drained. This caused the overlying rock that was once supported by the magma to collapse downward. Forming a massive depression known as a caldera. Over 326.7 km3 of tephra was erupted during this event. This could very well make the Rockland tephra the most voluminous eruption to have occurred in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, nearly twice the size of the Mazama ash. From 600,000 to 400,000 years ago, eruptions built a large conical stratovolcano called Mount Tehama (also called Brokeoff Volcano) in what is now the southwest corner of the park within the Rockland caldera complex. It was made of roughly alternating layers of andesitic lavas and tephra (volcanic ash, breccia, and pumice) with increasing amounts of tephra with elevation.

Tehama eventually reached an elevation of about , was wide at its base, and contained of material. Its principal vent lay in the neighborhood of what is now Sulphur Works, but a second vent from which no lavas issued lay on the eastern flank of Little Hot Springs Valley. Contrary to popular belief, Bumpass Hell is not one of Tehama&#x27;s main vents since it is located outside of the caldera. Tehama collapsed during the late Pleistocene, and numerous glacial advances tore down its remnants.

The largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. Between about 385,000 and 315,000 years ago the character and locus of volcanism in the Lassen Volcanic Center changed dramatically from the andesitic (silica content between basalt and dacite) stratocone to the Lassen domefield, which consists of a core of dacite lava domes surrounded by an arc of hybrid andesite flows. The dacite domes erupted along the northern flank of Brokeoff Volcano and are divided on the basis of age into the Bumpass sequence (about 300,000–190,000 years ago) and Eagle Peak sequence (about 70,000 years ago to present day). The hybrid andesite units erupted in two groups called the older Twin Lakes sequence (about 315,000 to 240,000 years ago, contemporaneous with the Bumpass Peak sequence) and younger Twin Lakes sequence (about 90,000 to present day, contemporaneous with the Eagle Peak sequence). No volcanism is known in the Lassen volcanic center during the period from 190,000 to 90,000 years ago.

Four shield volcanoes (Raker and Prospect Peaks, Red Mountain and Mount Harkness) grew to elevations of between at the corners of the central plateau. Raker Peak erupted andesite lavas while basalt flowed from the others. Each of these volcanoes developed a cinder cone on its summit during their last stages of eruption. Later, a mass of rhyolite was forced through the north flank of Sifford Mountain and a plug of dacite was pushed up through the west flank of Raker Peak.

In the past 50,000 years, at least seven major episodes of dacitic volcanism produced lava domes and pyroclastic deposits in the Lassen volcanic area, and another five episodes produced basaltic and andesitic lava flows. Eruptions have occurred at sites including Lassen Peak, Chaos Crags, and Sunflower Flat (explosive dacite eruptions followed by dome growth) and Tumble Buttes, Hat Mountain, and Prospect Peak (basalt eruptions). In addition, about 30 smaller volcanoes erupted basaltic lavas in the larger region surrounding the Lassen volcanic center. These volcanoes are geologically related to the Basin and Range volcanic province.

=== Development of Lassen Peak ===
Radiometric dating indicates that around 31,000 years ago a new vent opened up on the northeastern slope of Tehama, probably close to where Lassen Peak now stands. Streams of fluid dacite flowed chiefly toward the north, reaching a thickness of and covering perhaps . Known as the Loomis Sequence, these pre-Lassen dacites are the black, glassy, columnar lavas that now surround Lassen Peak.

Sometime between 25,000 and 31,000 years ago, Lassen Peak, a Pelean lava dome volcano, was pushed up through the pre-Lassen dacites. Lassen grew past the normal maximum size of plug dome volcanoes, , and reached a height of above the surrounding plateau in as little as a few years. The growth of the pile of lava shattered the rocks previously there, forming enormous banks of talus. When Lassen Peak formed, it looked much like the nearby Chaos Crags domes do today, with steep sides covered by angular rock talus. Lassen Peak&#x27;s shape was significantly altered by glacial erosion from 25,000 to 18,000 years ago during the Wisconsin glaciation. In turn the growth of Lassen Peak intercepted moisture, allowing a glacier on its northern flank to grow to almost long.
Later, but not precisely dated, eruptions from the Lassen volcanic area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which at first glance appears as a parasite on Lassen&#x27;s northeast flank, has been more heavily glaciated and thus is older. Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama&#x27;s flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak and Vulcan&#x27;s Castle. An upper limit of 10,000 years has been set for the domes next to Lost Creek (north domes). All of these domes must have risen with great rapidity.

=== Glacial action ===

Glaciers existed throughout the park area during most of the Pleistocene with smaller ones persisting at higher elevations until comparatively recent times. Lassen Peak is situated at a center from which many of these glaciers originated. Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting in the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.

Reading Peak formed a second center from which ice moved north into Hat Creek and Summit Creek. Ice moving southward united with some of the above glaciers and emptied into Warner Valley. On the central plateau, the ridge connecting Hat Mountain with Crater Butte served as a divide between ice flowing northward to Badger Flat and Hat Creek and that moving southward to Corral Meadows, Kings Creek and Warner Valley. Ice from Mount Harkness and Sifford Mountain also wound up in Warner Valley.

The crest of Saddle Mountain served as a divide with ice north of it moving into the depression containing Snag and Butte Lakes, while those to the south entered Warner Valley. The ice varied from a thickness of in Warner Valley to much thinner sheets in the higher mountains.

=== Post-glacial to 19th-century activity ===

Subsequent to the rise of Lassen Peak, several dacitic pumice cones developed in a rift extending northwest from the base of Lassen Peak. Then about 1,100 years ago several dacitic domes, the Chaos Crags, protruded through these cones and obliterated all but half of the southernmost cone. At least 300 years ago a series of large avalanches, possibly triggered by steam explosions, occurred on the north side of the Crags. These avalanches created their own &#x27;air cushions&#x27; that helped accelerate them to speeds exceeding and push them partway up Table Mountain. The resulting wilderness of debris, the Chaos Jumbles, covers an area of . Manzanita Lake was formed as a result of Manzanita Creek being dammed by the debris. Steam rose from the domes of Chaos Crags until 1857.

Around the mid-18th century a series of eruptions produced Cinder Cone in the northeast corner of the park, mantling an area of with ejecta in the process. Ash falling on the streams of lava pouring from the cone&#x27;s east flank formed the Painted Dunes. A flow of quartz-studded basalt lava (the Fantastic Lava Beds) poured from the Cinder Cone and dammed the streams that run towards Butte Lake to the north and Snag Lake to the south.

=== Early 20th-century activity ===

Explosions took place on Lassen Peak in 1914. Later, on May 19, 1915, a mass of lava rose in the summit crater and spilled down the western side of the volcano. Extensive lahars (mudflows) were created on the northeastern side as snowbanks were melted. The resulting debris swept down the slope. Divided by Raker Peak, part of this mudflow raced down Lost Creek; the remaining flow passed over the rise east of the park road and rushed down Hat Creek. A wide barren swath was torn through the forest.

A great explosion blasted out a new crater three days later on May 22. A volcanic cloud rose , but a portion of the explosive force was deflected downward. The resulting pyroclastic flow of super-heated gas, rocks and ash roared down the same path taken by the mudflow, resulting in further damage along the headwaters of Hat and Lost Creeks. Ash from the eruption blew eastward with some fine ash falling at least as far as from the volcano.

The last major eruptions of Lassen Peak occurred in April through June 1917, when a new crater was created at the summit of the mountain. Less explosive activity continued through 1921. The Smithsonian considers the eruption of Mount Lassen to have ended on June 29, 1917.

Since then, the volcano has been dormant, although some steam still rises from small vents in its summit and on its flanks. Pumice ejected during the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak is conspicuously banded with light streaks of dacite and dark andesite, which appears to represent two distinct magmas imperfectly mixed during the eruption. The 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak was the second most recent volcanic outburst in the contiguous 48 U.S. states (after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington).

== Volcanic hazards ==
=== Direct eruption hazards ===

The Lassen area remains volcanically active. The most common volcanic activity over the last 50,000 years in the Lassen volcanic area consists of small to moderate-sized eruptions that produce basaltic lava flows and localized ash falls. These eruptions typically last a few months to a year, but may continue for several years. They can cover more than with lava flows, build cinder cones as high as , and blanket many square miles (square kilometers) with ash a few inches (several cm) to about three feet (one meter) deep. Because these eruptions are relatively nonviolent, they rarely cause human fatalities.

Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area typically begin with steam explosions caused by the interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano&#x27;s slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (about 8 km) of the vent with a thick layer of pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.

The areas of highest hazard are those that could be affected by pyroclastic flows and lahars. These areas, including Hat Creek Valley, are those in the immediate vicinity and downhill from likely eruption sites. Fallout of ash will affect areas downwind at the time of an eruption. Within the hazard zones, relative hazard is gradational, decreasing away from the location of potential vents.

After an initial explosive eruption, extrusion of gas-depleted dacite magma commonly forms lava domes. Growing lava domes are inherently unstable, and collapse of their steep sides often generates pyroclastic flows of lava blocks and ash that can travel several miles. Such a sequence of events is recorded by the deposits related to the emplacement of Chaos Crags domes between 1,100 and 1,000 years ago.

Interaction of hot pyroclastic flows with snow and ice can generate highly mobile flows of mud and debris (called lahars) that may rush down valleys leading away from a volcano. Because of this, active volcanoes that have a significant snow and ice cover can be particularly dangerous. The lahars that threatened residents of the Lassen area in May 1915 were generated by relatively small eruptions of Lassen Peak. Nonetheless, they traveled down creek beds as far as and released floods that affected valleys for downstream.

=== Non-eruption hazards ===

Additional volcano hazards at Lassen are rockfalls and landslides not directly related to eruptions. Recently erupted volcanic domes are unstable and can collapse, generating small to large rockfalls. Approximately 350 years ago, collapse of one of the Chaos Crags domes generated huge rockfalls, creating an area now called the Chaos Jumbles. The first and largest of these traveled downslope and was able to climb up the side of Table Mountain. The trigger for the rockfall is unknown, but was most likely a large earthquake. Normal weathering also weakens fractured volcanic rock and contributes to small rockfalls. In the summer of 1994, a rockfall of occurred on the northeastern flank of Lassen Peak. During periods of extreme rainfall or snow melt, mudflows are sometimes generated by mobilization of loose volcanic debris and soil on the slopes of volcanoes.

The only current visible activity in the Lassen volcanic area is from the various geothermal areas in Lassen Volcanic National Park; boiling hot springs, bubbling mud pots and fuming fumaroles. Most of these features lie in or are closely adjacent to Mount Tehama&#x27;s caldera. In each thermal area, the highest temperature of water generally is close to the boiling temperature at the altitude of the particular spring or fumarole at Bumpass Hell and on the northwest flanks of Lassen Peak.

The hottest and most vigorous hydrothermal features in the Lassen volcanic area are at Bumpass Hell, which marks the principal area of upflow and steam discharge from the Lassen hydrothermal system. A prominent steam plume marks the site of Big Boiler, the largest fumarole in the park. The temperature of the high-velocity steam jetting from it has been measured as high as . A thin crust of material often covers these boiling hot features, making them a serious burn hazard to anyone walking off trail. The waters of the features are typically acidic and, even if cool enough, are not safe for bathing.

<text>Jonathan Herbert Schaeffer (born 1957) is a Canadian researcher and professor at the University of Alberta and the former Canada Research Chair in Artificial Intelligence.

He led the team that wrote Chinook, the world&#x27;s strongest American checkers player, after some relatively good results in writing computer chess programs. He is involved in the University of Alberta GAMES group developing computer poker systems. Schaeffer is also a member of the research group that created Polaris, a program designed to play the Texas Hold&#x27;em variant of poker. He is a Founder of Onlea, which produces online learning experiences.

==Early life==
Born in Toronto, Ontario, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1979 from the University of Toronto. He received a Master of Mathematics degree in 1980 and a Ph.D. in 1986 from the University of Waterloo. Schaeffer reached national master strength in chess while in his early 20s, but has played little competitive chess since that time.

==Draughts: Chinook==

Chinook is the first computer program to win the world champion title in a competition against humans. In 1990 it won the right to play in the human World Championship by being second to Marion Tinsley in the US Nationals. At first the American Checkers Federation and English Draughts Association were against the participation of a computer in a human championship. When Tinsley resigned his title in protest, the ACF and EDA created the new title Man vs. Machine World Championship, and competition proceeded. Tinsley won with four wins to Chinook&#x27;s two.

In a rematch, Chinook was declared the Man-Machine World Champion in checkers in 1994 in a match against Marion Tinsley after six drawn games, and Tinsley&#x27;s withdrawal due to pancreatic cancer. While Chinook became the world champion, it had never defeated the best checkers player of all time, Tinsley, who was significantly superior to even his closest peer.

The championship continued with Chinook defending its title against Don Lafferty when it lost one game, won one and drew 18. After the match, Jonathan Schaeffer decided not to let Chinook compete anymore, but instead try to solve checkers. It was rated at 2814 Elo.

In 2007, after 18 years of computation, he proved through a weak solution that checkers always results in a draw if neither player makes a mistake. The solution involved 1014 calculations from endgame positions with fewer than 10 pieces on the board.

==Poker: Polaris==

Schaeffer is a member and, until 2004, leader of the computer poker research group at the University of Alberta, which has developed several strong computer programs for playing Texas hold &#x27;em poker. The earliest and most general of these is Poki, which uses Monte Carlo simulation to choose actions during a game. More recently, the group has focused on the two-player (Heads-Up) variant, and has developed a series of programs that approximate Nash equilibrium strategies for the game. Several of these programs (such as Poki, SparBot and VexBot) are available in products such as Poker Academy from BioTools.

In July 2007, Schaeffer announced a competition between the group&#x27;s newest program, Polaris, and two human professionals, Phil Laak and Ali Eslami. The competition was held at the 2007 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) conference, which also hosted an international competition between computer poker programs. Out of four matches against the human professionals, Polaris won one, tied one, and lost twice; overall, the humans won the competition by a small margin. In the computer competition, Polaris (playing under the name Hyperborean) won the Limit Hold&#x27;em event and came first in the No-Limit Hold&#x27;em event. In 2008, an updated version of Polaris defeated a team of human professionals in the Second Man-Machine Poker Competition.

==Currently==

Schaeffer was previously the vice-provost for information technology at the University of Alberta. On July 1, 2012, he started serving a five-year term as dean of science at the University of Alberta. He is a founder of Onlea, a nonprofit organization, which produces interactive online learning experiences such as Massive Open Online Courses.

<doc id="345248" wikidata="Q859354" url="?curid=345248" title="Lassen Peak">
<text>Lassen Peak ( ), commonly referred to as Mount Lassen, is a lava dome volcano in Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California. Located in the Shasta Cascade region above the northern Sacramento Valley, it is the southernmost active volcano in the Cascade Range of the Western United States, and part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc stretching from southwestern British Columbia to Northern California. It supports many flora and fauna among its diverse habitats, which reach high elevations and are subject to frequent snowfall.

Lassen Peak has a volume of , making it one of the largest lava domes on Earth. The volcano arose from the former northern flank of now-eroded Mount Tehama about 27,000 years ago, from a series of eruptions over the course of a few years. The mountain has been significantly eroded by glaciers over the last 25,000 years, and is now covered in talus deposits.

On May 22, 1915, a powerful explosive eruption at Lassen Peak devastated nearby areas, and spread volcanic ash as far as to the east. This explosion was the most powerful in a series of eruptions from 1914 through 1917. Lassen Peak and Mount St. Helens in Washington were the only two volcanoes within the contiguous United States to erupt during the 20th century.

Lassen Volcanic National Park, which encompasses an area of , was created to preserve the areas affected by the eruption for future observation and study, to protect the nearby volcanic features, and to keep anyone from settling too close to the mountain. The park, along with the nearby Lassen National Forest and Lassen Peak, have become popular destinations for recreational activities, including climbing, hiking, backpacking, snowshoeing, kayaking, and backcountry skiing. Lassen Peak is dormant, meaning the volcano is merely inactive, and it has a functioning magma chamber under the ground still capable of eruptions. Thus it poses a threat to the nearby area through lava flows, pyroclastic flows, lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows), ash, avalanches, and floods. To monitor this threat, Lassen Peak and the surrounding vicinity are closely observed with sensors by the California Volcano Observatory.

== Geography ==
Lassen Peak lies within Lassen Volcanic National Park, in Shasta County, California, east of the city of Redding. Lassen Peak and the rest of the National Park area are surrounded by the Lassen National Forest, which has an area of . Nearby towns include Mineral in Tehama County and Viola in Shasta County.

Lassen Peak reaches an elevation of , according to 1992 data from the U.S. National Geodetic Survey; 1981 data from the Geographic Names Information System lists the mountain&#x27;s elevation at . Lassen Peak marks the southernmost major volcano in the Cascade Range, rising above the northern Sacramento Valley. Bounded by the Sacramento Valley and the Klamath Mountains to the west and the Sierra Nevada mountain range to the south, it is the second tallest peak in the California segment of the Cascades, behind Mount Shasta, which lies to the north. Due to its proximity to nearby volcanoes Mount Tehama and Mount Diller, it is not easy to distinguish from its neighboring peaks.

=== Physical geography ===
Lassen Peak has the highest known winter snowfall amounts in California, with an average annual snowfall of ; in some years, more than of snow falls at its base elevation of at Lake Helen. The Lassen Peak area receives more precipitation (rain, sleet, hail, snow, etc.) than anywhere in the Cascade Range south of the Three Sisters volcanoes in Oregon. Though the volcano lies too far to the south to support a permanent snow cover over the entire mountain, the heavy annual snowfall on Lassen Peak creates fourteen permanent patches of snow on and around the mountain top, but no glaciers.

Lightning has been known to strike the area frequently during summer thunderstorms. These can initiate fires. On July 23, 2012, a lightning strike started the Reading Fire to the northeast of the Paradise Meadow region, which was contained after it reached an area of . During the summer and fall of 2016, the National Park Service carried out prescribed fires to help reduce the amount of fuel available for fires in the Mineral Headquarters area and the Manzanita and Juniper Lake areas, respectively.

===Climate===
== Ecology ==
Lassen Peak supports a variety of flora that include mountain hemlock, whitebark pine, and alpine wildflowers. Mountain hemlocks generally only reach an elevation of , while whitebark pines reach up to . Throughout the national park, forests can be found featuring red fir, mountain alder, western white pine, white fir, lodgepole pine, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, juniper, and live oak. Other plants found in the Lassen Peak area consist of coyote mint, lupines, mule&#x27;s ears, ferns, corn lilies, red mountain heathers, pinemat manzanitas,
greenleaf manzanitas, bush chinquapins, catchflies, Fremont&#x27;s butterweed,
buckwheat, granite gilia, mountain pride, mariposa tulips, creambush, and a variety of chaparral shrubs.

The various habitats in the Lassen Volcanic National Park support about 300 vertebrate species like mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and birds, including bald eagles, which are listed as &quot;Threatened&quot; under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and peregrine falcons, which were removed from the endangered species list in 1999. In forested areas below , animals include American black bears, mule deer, martens, brown creepers, mountain chickadees, white-headed woodpeckers, long-toed salamanders, and several bat species. At higher elevations, Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers, deer mice, and chipmunks can be found among mountain hemlock stands, and subalpine zones with sparse vegetation host populations of gray-crowned rosy finches, pikas, and golden-mantled ground squirrels. Among scattered stands of pinemat manzanita, red fir, and lodgepole pine, animals include dark-eyed juncos, montane voles, and sagebrush lizards. Meadows at the bottoms of valleys along streams and lakes support Pacific tree frogs, Western terrestrial garter snakes, common snipes, and mountain pocket gophers. Other animals found within the national park area include snakes like rubber boas, common garter snakes, and striped whipsnakes; cougars; amphibians like newts, salamanders, rough-skinned newts, and Cascades frogs; 216 species of birds including MacGillivray&#x27;s warblers, Wilson&#x27;s warblers, song sparrows, spotted owls, northern goshawks, and bufflehead ducks; five species of native fish that include rainbow trout, tui chubs, speckled daces, Lahontan redsides, and Tahoe suckers; and four invasive fish species including brook trout, brown trout, golden shiners, and fathead minnows. Prominent invertebrate species include California tortoiseshell butterflies.

==Geology==

Lassen Peak lies near the southern end of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, at the western edge of the Basin and Range Province. Like other Cascade volcanoes, it was fed by magma chambers produced by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the western edge of the continental North American tectonic plate. The region is also affected geologically by the Cascadia subduction zone, which dips eastward beneath the western coast of North America in the Pacific Northwest, as well as horizontal stretching to the east of crustal rock in the Basin and Range Province. About 3 million years ago, the southern limit of active volcanoes in the Cascades corresponded to the Yana Volcanic Center to the south of Lassen Peak, but currently the southern edge of the Lassen Volcanic National Park now marks the same border, indicating that the Cascade Arc&#x27;s southern end migrates at a rate of annually.

In the southern segment of the Cascades, volcanoes exhibit widespread and long-lived activity produced by magma that ranges from low-silica basalt to siliceous (silica-rich) rhyolite. The Lassen volcanic center is fed by two magma chambers, one calc-alkaline reservoir common to the rest of the Cascade Volcanoes, and the other a smaller volume of low-potassium olivine tholeiitic basalt associated with the Basin and Range province. Within the region, most if not all of the volcanic rock has erupted in the past 3 million years. During this period, at least five large andesitic stratovolcanoes (such as Mount Maidu) formed in the vicinity of Lassen Volcanic National Park, building volcanic cones before going extinct and undergoing erosion. For most volcanic centers in the Southern Cascades, one volcano becomes active and normally becomes extinct as another begins to erupt, but at the Lassen locus, the Maidu and Dittmar volcanic centers overlapped during the late Pliocene to the early Pleistocene. Volcanism within the Lassen vicinity follows a trend of intermittent, episodic eruptions punctuating long periods of dormancy, a pattern which persisted through the late Pleistocene and Holocene. During the past 825,000 years, the area has produced hundreds of explosive eruptions over an area of , and the past 50,000 years have seen seven major silicic eruptive episodes that produced dacitic lava domes, tephra, and pyroclastic flows, along with five periods of basaltic and andesitic lava flows.

Local activity began 600,000 years ago with the formation of Brokeoff Volcano (alternatively known as Mount Tehama). Around the same time, about 614,000 years ago, an explosive eruption southwest of Lassen Peak produced of pumice and ash, covering the area between the vent and what is now the city of Ventura, California. This deposit, referred to as the Rockland tephra, reaches up to several inches in thickness within the San Francisco Bay area, and can be found as far as northern Nevada and southern Idaho. The same eruption also formed one of three known calderas within the Cascade, the others being Crater Lake and the Kulshan Caldera at Mount Baker. Shortly after, the Lassen volcanic center, a cluster of closely spaced volcanoes, formed in the area, covering the nearby caldera. During the late Pleistocene it produced andesite lava flows that built the Brokeoff composite volcano (stratovolcano). Following the end of volcanism at Brokeoff Volcano hydrothermal fluids began chemically weathering minerals in the andesite flows, altering the once strong rocks into easily eroded materials. Glaciers and streams were able to rapidly erode deep channels into these altered volcanic rocks, reducing the once lofty peak of Brokeoff Volcano into the landscape we see today. Following the erosion of Brokeoff Volcano, volcanism migrated to the Lassen Domefield to the northeast.
Lassen Peak&#x27;s lava dome formed about 27,000 years ago from a series of eruptions over a few years, undergoing significant glacial erosion between 25,000 and 18,000 years ago. The bowl-shaped depression on the volcano&#x27;s northeastern flank, called a cirque, was eroded by a glacier that extended out from the dome. By 18,000 years ago, Lassen Peak started to form a mound-shaped dacite lava dome, pushing its way through Tehama&#x27;s former northern flank. As the lava dome grew it shattered overlaying rock, which formed a blanket of angular talus around the emerging steep-sided volcano. Likely resembling the nearby 1,100-year-old Chaos Crags, Lassen Peak reached its present height in a relatively short time, probably in just a few years. Within the past 1,000 years or so, activity at Lassen Peak has produced six dacite lava domes, erupted tephra and pyroclastic flows, and built Cinder Cone and the Fantastic Lava Beds. It also created the rockfalls at Chaos Jumbles.

The only active Cascade volcano with an elevation above that is not a stratovolcano, Lassen Peak is a rhyodacitic lava dome. It represents one of the largest lava domes on Earth, with a height of above its surroundings, and an approximate volume of . Unlike more conventional, conical stratovolcanoes like Mount Shasta or Mount Rainier, Lassen Peak is part of a volcanic center that erupts from different vents, which each remain active for a number of years or decades but often do not erupt from the same vent twice, also known as a monogenetic volcanic field. 2000 years after Lassen&#x27;s formation, it was surrounded by glaciers which ate away at its spiny protrusions of dacite. Due to glacial erosion from the last local glacial advance, which ceased roughly 15,000 years ago, Lassen&#x27;s lava dome is now covered in broken rock fragments at the base of crags called talus deposits. Only its crag formations on its southern flank, near the summit trailhead, have not been significantly altered by glacial erosion.

=== Subfeatures ===
The Lassen volcanic center includes Brokeoff Volcano, Lassen&#x27;s dacitic lava dome, and a number of small andesitic shield volcanoes found northeast of Lassen Peak. The Lassen dome field includes 30 dacitic lava domes such as Bumpass Mountain, Mount Helen, Ski Heil Peak, and Reading Peak; other major lava domes include Chaos Crags, Eagle Peak, Sunflower Flat, and Vulcans Castle. Nearby shield volcanoes include Prospect Peak and West Prospect Peak, and there are three cones close to Lassen Peak: Cinder Cone, Hat Mountain, and Raker Peak. The hydrothermal area inside the Lassen Peak volcanic center, with features located southeast and southwest of Lassen Peak, represents the largest geothermal area in the United States besides the one present at Yellowstone National Park.

The Chaos Crags, a series of five small lava domes, represent the youngest part of Lassen volcanic center&#x27;s dome field, reaching an elevation of about above their surroundings. They were produced by vigorous explosive eruptions of pumice and ash followed by effusive activity, which created unstable edifices that partially collapsed and formed pyroclastic flows made of incandescent lava blocks and lithic ash. Six domes were originally formed, though one was destroyed by a pyroclastic flow. Roughly 350 years ago, one of the domes collapsed to produce the Chaos Jumbles, an area where three enormous rockfalls transformed the local area and traveled as far as down the dome&#x27;s slopes.

Cinder Cone, which reaches an elevation of above its surrounding area in the northeastern region of the Lassen Volcanic National Park, forms a symmetrical pyroclastic cone. The youngest mafic volcano in the Lassen volcanic center, it is surrounded by unvegetated block lava and has concentric craters at its summit. Cinder Cone is comprised by five basaltic andesite and andesite lava flows, and it also has two cinder cone volcanoes, with two scoria cones, the first of which was mostly destroyed by lava flows from its base. In 1850 and 1851, a number of observers reported an eruption at Cinder Cone visible from more than away, with one observer near the mountain claiming to have observed a lava flow &quot;running down the sides of the volcano.&quot; However, despite these testimonies and accounts in newspaper articles and several scientific journals, the veracity of these eruptions has been questioned by scientists from the United States Geological Survey. In addition to the fact that cinder cones usually erupt lava from base vents, there is a lack of physical evidence suggesting activity at the volcano since its formation in 1650. In addition, an old willow bush growing near the summit crater that was documented during the 1850s was still present in the 1880s after the alleged eruptions, suggesting that no eruptions took place during the 1850s.

==Human history==
The areas surrounding Lassen Peak, especially to its east, south, and southeast, represented a meeting ground for Maidu, Yana, Yahi, and Atsugewi Native Americans. The volcano is known among some native populations as &quot;Amblu Kai&quot;, which means &quot;Mountain Ripped Apart&quot; or &quot;Fire Mountain,&quot; and as &quot;Kom Yamani,&quot; which means &quot;Snow Mountain,&quot; among the Mountain Maidu. Because the area was not suitable for permanent habitation, there is relatively scarce archaeological evidence of a native presence in the Lassen area.

The first white man to reach Lassen Peak was Jedediah Smith, who passed through the area in 1821 as he made his way for the western coast of the United States. After the California Gold Rush brought increased numbers of settlers into the area, Lassen Peak was named in honor of a Danish blacksmith, Peter Lassen, who guided immigrants past the peak to the Sacramento Valley during the 1830s. This trail was replaced by the Nobles Emigrant Trail, named for the guide William Nobles, who pioneered the trail in 1851.

Lassen Peak&#x27;s first recorded ascent took place in 1851, led by Grover K. Godfrey. In 1864, painter Helen Tanner Brodt became the first woman to reach the summit of Lassen Peak, wanting to sketch the surrounding landscape. A tarn lake on Lassen Peak is named &quot;Lake Helen&quot; in her honor. The Bumpass Hell, a hydrothermal vent area near Lassen Peak, was named after a pioneer who suffered burns there and lost his leg shortly after. Other historic names for Lassen Peak include Mount Joseph (from 1827), Snow Butte, Sister Buttes, and Mount Lassen.

=== Lassen Volcanic National Park ===
United States President Theodore Roosevelt established the Lassen Peak National Monument in 1907. Despite Native population claims that Lassen Peak was &quot;full of fire and water&quot; and would erupt again, this motion was based on the general belief that Lassen Peak was now extinct, and that its vicinity contained intriguing volcanic phenomena, which could be studied and observed. Once the volcano became active again in 1914, the monument was expanded to establish the Lassen Volcanic National Park on August 9, 1916. The park, in area, can be reached from the California State Route 89 highway.

== Eruptive history ==
=== Ancient activity ===
Between 385,000 and 315,000 years ago, volcanism at the Lassen center shifted from andesitic stratovolcano construction to production of dacite domes. Over the past 300,000 years, the Lassen Peak area has produced more than 30 lava domes, Lassen Peak being the largest. These lava domes formed as a result of rising lava that was pushed up but was too viscous to escape its source, creating steep edifices. Lassen Peak&#x27;s lava dome formed 27,000 years ago from a series of eruptions over a few years, undergoing significant glacial erosion between 25,000 and 18,000 years ago. No volcanic activity took place 190,000 years ago to roughly 90,000 years ago, but during the last 100,000 years, there have been at least 12 periods of eruptive activity in the Lassen volcanic center, and since 90,000 years ago, the Twin Lakes sequence has been producing mixed lavas with variable appearances and compositions, including andesite and basaltic andesite lava flows and agglutinated volcanic cones (made of fused pyroclastic rocks) located by the Lassen dome field. The Twin Lakes sequence includes the construction of the Chaos Crag dome complex between 1100 and 1000 years ago and eruptions at Lassen Peak beginning in 1914.

Prior to 1914, Lassen Peak likely underwent at least one explosive eruption, which created a summit crater deep with a diameter of . Deposits from older mudflows that can be traced specifically to the Lassen dome have also been found in Hat Creek, Lost Creek, and in a region to the east of the Devastated Area.

=== 1914–1921 ===

On May 30, 1914, despite an apparent lack of precursor earthquakes, Lassen became volcanically active again after 27,000 years of dormancy, when it produced a steam explosion that carved out a small crater with a fairly deep lake on the volcano&#x27;s summit. The crater grew as it was carved by more than 180 similar phreatic explosions over the span of more than 11 months, reaching a length of . On May 14, 1915, Lassen Peak erupted lava blocks, which extended as far as Manton, west of the mountain. By the next day, the volcano had produced a dacitic lava dome, between 63 and 68 percent silica, which occupied its summit crater. On May 19, a large eruption destroyed this dome, and a new crater formed at the summit. No lava erupted, but parts of the dome fell on the upper flanks of the mountain, which were covered in more than of snow. The lava mixed with snow and rock to form a lahar (volcanically induced mudslide, landslide, and debris flow), in width, which coursed down the side of the volcano, traveling and reaching Hat Creek. After being deflected to the northwest at Emigrant Pass, the lahar extended an additional down Lost Creek. On May 20, the lower Hat Creek valley flooded with muddy water, which damaged ranch houses in the Old Station area and caused minor injuries among a few people, all of whom escaped. Removing homes from their foundation, the lahar also uprooted trees more than tall. The flood continued for another , killing fish in the Pit River. Simultaneously, dacite lava with lower viscosity than dacite from the previous eruption filled the summit crater, overflowing and extending in two streams for down the mountain&#x27;s western and northeastern sides.

On May 22, 1915, at about 4:00 p.m., Lassen Peak produced a violent explosive eruption that ejected rock and pumice and formed a larger and deeper crater at its summit. Within 30 minutes, volcanic ash and gas formed a column that reached altitudes of more than and could be seen from the city of Eureka, to the west. This column underwent a partial collapse, generating a pyroclastic flow composed of hot ash, pumice, rock, and gas that destroyed of land and spawned a lahar extending from the volcano and again reaching Hat Creek Valley. Smaller mudflows also formed on every side of the volcano, as well a layer of pumice and volcanic ash that reached as far as northeast; volcanic ash was detected up to east at the city of Elko, Nevada. Additionally, the lava flow on the volcano&#x27;s northeastern flank was removed by this eruption, but not the similar deposit on the western flank.

The eruptive output volume totaled , dwarfed by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which had a volume of . The region on the volcano&#x27;s northeastern flank destroyed by the eruptions, in area, is now known as the Devastated Area, and it along with other deposits from the volcano has been altered by erosion and regrowth of vegetation, though the vegetation in Devastated Area is sparse due to its siliceous (rich in silica), nutrient-deprived soil, which cannot sustain normal tree growth due to its lack of water retention. Due to their small size and thin deposits, the 1915 eruptions will likely not be well-preserved geologically.

After 1915, steam explosions continued for several years, indicating extremely hot rock beneath Lassen Peak&#x27;s surface. In May 1917, an especially strong steam explosion formed the northern crater on Lassen Peak&#x27;s summit, with eruptions lasting two days and producing an ash cloud that extended into the sky. Another 21 explosions occurred in June, further transforming the crater and creating a new vent on Lassen Peak&#x27;s northwestern summit. More steam eruptions followed in June 1919 and similar activity was observed the next year, on April 8–9, 1920, followed by more steam eruptions lasting 10–12 hours in October of the same year. During February 1921, white steam erupted from eastern fissures on the volcano. In total, about 400 eruptions were observed between 1914 and 1921, which were the last eruptions in the Cascades before the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which was the only other volcanic eruption in the contiguous United States during the 20th century.

=== Documentation of 20th century eruptions through pictures and film ===

During its eruptions in the early 20th century, Lassen Peak attracted widespread media attention as the first volcano to erupt in the United States during the 20th century. Unlike eruptions at Mount Baker, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, or Mount Hood during the 19th century, Lassen Peak&#x27;s eruptions 
were very well documented by newspapers and extensively photographed. Though there is a large supply of images documenting these eruptions at Lassen Peak, the best and most complete images were taken by the local businessman Benjamin Franklin Loomis. Using an 8x10-inch camera with glass-plate negatives, Loomis made his own film and set up a darkroom in a tent. He wrote of the eruption he witnessed on June 14, 1914, &quot;The sight was fearfully grand.&quot; Loomis&#x27;s pictures were published in his book &quot;Pictorial History of the Lassen Volcano&quot; (1926); a number of his original plates remain in the archives of the National Park Service. His photographs have been used to help understand the timeline and geology of the 1915 eruptions of Lassen Peak.

One of Lassen Peak&#x27;s 1917 eruptions was captured on film by Justin Hammer from the nearby Catfish Lake. Originally silent, the film features sound effects added by his grandson, Craig Martin. The film was rediscovered and published in 2015 by the Shasta Historical Society.

=== Recent activity and current threats ===

Lassen Peak remains an active volcano, as volcanic activity including fumaroles (steam vents), hot springs, and mudpots can be found throughout Lassen Volcanic National Park. Their activity varies based on the season; during the spring, when meltwater is more abundant, fumaroles and pools of water have lower temperatures, while mudpots have more fluid mud supplies. During summer and droughts, they become drier and hotter, since they cannot be cooled by ground water. Geothermal activity can be observed at Bumpass Hell, Little Hot Springs Valley, Pilot Pinnacle, Sulphur Works, Devils Kitchen, Boiling Springs Lake, and Terminal Geyser, as well as the Morgan and Growler Hot Springs south of the national park in Mill Canyon. These are produced by the boiling of underground bodies of water, which generates steam. At Bumpass Hell, these features are at their most vigorous, with temperatures reaching at Big Boiler, the park&#x27;s biggest fumarole and one of the hottest hydrothermal fumaroles in the world. Because of their acidic conditions and heat, none of these hydrothermal bodies are safe for bathing except for at Drakesbad Guest Ranch. Fumaroles near Lassen Peak in particular remained active through the 1950s, but have grown weaker over time; they can still be found among the volcano&#x27;s summit craters. These hydrothermal features are monitored continuously for their physical and chemical conditions by the United States Geological Survey.

Climbers reported steam eruptions in the summit craters for decades after activity apparently ceased in 1921, and the naturalist Paul Schulz documented 30 steam vents at the summit in the 1950s. A report from the United States Geological Survey declared that &quot;No one can say when, but it is almost certain that the Lassen area will experience volcanic eruptions again.&quot; Similarly, the California Volcano Observatory lists its threat level as &quot;Very High.&quot; At the time of the early 20th century eruptions, the area surrounding the volcano was only sparsely populated, but a similar eruption today would threaten many lives and the northern Californian economy. Volcanic eruptions occur with similar frequency to major earthquakes from the San Andreas Fault, and at least 10 eruptions have taken place within the state during the past 1,000 years, the most recent at Lassen Peak. Under 1 percent of the state&#x27;s population lives within hazard zones that could be affected by an eruption, but collectively hazard zones are visited by more than 20 million people each year. Moreover, a number of the potentially active Californian volcanoes reside less than from highly populated areas, and explosive eruptions could produce ash that travels for several hundred miles. In the case of signs that suggest impending volcanic activity, the United States Geological Survey has a plan in place to utilize portable monitoring instruments, deploy scientists to the area, and implement an emergency response plan developed by the National Park Service if an eruption were imminent.

Although basaltic lava flows are the most common eruptive activity in the Lassen volcanic center, they could also produce more violent and thus more hazardous silicic lava flows, in addition to building additional, unstable lava domes that could collapse and spawn pyroclastic flows that could extend for several miles. Because Lassen Peak has a significant amount of snow and ice, these pyroclastic flows (or hot volcanic ash) might mix with water to form lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows) that could destroy nearby communities. Dacitic eruptions could produce volcanic columns of gas and ash that could threaten aircraft in the area. Moreover, the Lassen volcanic center poses threats to visitors from sudden avalanches that could be entirely unrelated to eruptive activity. Due to the threat of an avalanche from nearby Chaos Crag if volcanic activity renewed in the area or an earthquake occurred, the Visitor Center for Lassen Peak located at Manzanita Lake closed in 1974. In 1993, a rockfall with a volume of fell down Lassen Peak&#x27;s northeastern flank, but no visitors were harmed. Despite the volcano&#x27;s current quiet state, rockfalls still pose significant hazards due to the peak&#x27;s inherent instability.

The volcano is monitored by the California Volcano Observatory, which has a sensor network that can measure increased seismicity, ground deformation, or gas emissions suggesting movement of magma towards the surface near the volcano. The United States Geological Survey, in cooperation with the National Park Service, has been monitoring Lassen Peak and other volcanic areas in the park with tiltmeters, seismometers, and inclinometers. Prior to 1996, geodetic surveys at Lassen Peak did not detect ground deformation, but Interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) surveys between 1996 and 2000 suggested that downward subsidence was occurring at a rate of each year within a circular area with a diameter of centered just of the volcano. As a result, additional surveys using the Global Positioning System took place in 2004, and further InSAR surveys showed that subsidence continued through 2010. Lassen Peak is one of four Cascade volcanoes that has undergone subsidence since 1990, with Medicine Lake Volcano, Mount Baker, and Mount St. Helens. Though not conclusively linked to a possible eruption, this subsidence may offer insight into how magma is stored within the region, tectonic setting, and how hydrothermal systems evolve over long periods of time. GPS receivers have been in place to monitor deformation within the Lassen volcanic center since 2008, and 13 seismometers in the vicinity, first installed in 1976 and since updated each decade, continually survey earthquakes within the locale.

== Recreation ==
The Lassen Volcanic National Park is visited by more than 350,000 people every year. Incorporating more than of hiking trails, it is visited by people looking to hike or backpack during the summers. Popular winter activities include snowshoeing and backcountry skiing. As the second-tallest volcano in Northern California, trailing only Mount Shasta, Lassen Peak is frequently visited by climbers and hikers from around the world. The summit opens for use most years near the end of June, remaining in use until heavy snow falls in October or November. After a 9-year-old boy died from a collapsed retaining wall along the summit trail on July 29, 2009, the path closed for six years for construction, reopening in 2015.

The mountain&#x27;s summit trail can be accessed from a parking lot on the northern side of the California State Route 89. The Lassen Peak Trail, which starts from this parking area, runs for with switchback turns, a round-trip hike in length that ascends approximately from the trailhead at to the summit at . From the northeast summit, Lassen&#x27;s 1915 mudflow and Prospect Peak are visible; the northwestern summit offers views of Lassen&#x27;s two bowl-shaped craters and Mount Shasta, to the north.

The southern entrance to the park area has a winter sports area where visitors can ski, snowshoe, and within the Lassen National Forest, visitors can also bicycle, go boating, or use snowmobiles.

<doc id="345250" wikidata="Q5548578" url="?curid=345250" title="Geothermal areas in Lassen Volcanic National Park">
<text>The geothermal areas in Lassen Volcanic National Park include several groups of hot springs and fumaroles, as remnants of former volcanic activity, exist in Lassen Volcanic National Park in northeastern California. Most of these lie in or are closely adjacent to Mount Tehama&#x27;s caldera. &quot;Bumpass Hell&quot; is the most spectacular of these, but others of importance are &quot;Sulphur Works&quot;, &quot;Little Hot Springs Valley&quot;, &quot;Boiling Springs Lake&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;. In each thermal area, the highest temperature of water generally is close to the boiling temperature at the altitude of the particular spring or fumarole — at Bumpass Hell and on the northwest flanks of Lassen Peak.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS-Lassen-Volcanoes/Lava Flows&quot;&gt;NPS: Lassen Volcanic National Park, Nature &amp; science, Volcanoes / Lava Flows&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures as high as have been recorded in the park.

Spring activity varies with water supply. Abundant water results in clear springs during early summer, but as the season progresses and the water supply decreases, springs change successively to turbid, warm pools, spattering mudpots, and finally steaming fumaroles. There are no true geysers within Lassen Volcanic National Park.

Gases from hot springs are composed mostly of steam and carbon dioxide, with minor amounts of other gases. These react with the rocks around the springs to ultimately form opal if temperature and acidity are high, or kaolin if they are low. Deposits of sulfur, pyrite, quartz and other substances are also found around the springs and in their runoff channels.

Solfataric alteration within the caldera of Mount Tehama covers about , much more extensive than the present hot springs basins. indicative of its former extent and suggestive of its waning activity. It is the altered materials in the caldera that yielded most readily to the forces of erosion. Diamond Peak is a body of unaltered rock that still remains, because it is more resistant.

==Sulphur Works and Little Hot Springs Valley==
As in many hydrothermally active areas, the rocks at Sulphur Works and Little Hot Springs Valley in Lassen Volcanic National Park have been chemically altered into bright-colored clays. Sulfurous acid and sulfuric acid have broken down hard, gray-green andesite lavas into red, yellow and buff clays and iron oxides. Many visitors pass through Sulphur Works on their way north on State Route 89 and sense the rotten-egg smell (hydrogen sulfide) when they pass by a hot vent to the east of the road. Sulphur Works is said to be the volcanic center of the ancestral Mount Tehama.

== Bumpass Hell ==

Near Little Hot Springs Valley is Bumpass Hell, a hydrothermally altered geothermal area that spans 16 acres (6.5 ha) and has hot springs, fumaroles, and boiling mudpots. As part of Mount Tehama&#x27;s main vent, Bumpass Hell is the result of fissures that tap the volcanic heat, thought to be a cooling mass of andesite, perhaps three miles (5 km) below the surface.

It is named after Kendall Vanhook Bumpass, a cowboy and early settler who worked in the Lassen Peak area in the 1860s. Bumpass discovered the geothermal feature and was named on a mining claim for the area. In 1865 the editor of the &quot;Red Bluff Independent&quot; newspaper took a trip with Bumpass to see the locale. During this trip Bumpass broke through a thin crust above a scalding hot mudpot; his leg was badly scalded and eventually had to be amputated. The area was named in his honor.

== Devils Kitchen ==
About southeast of Lassen Peak is Devils Kitchen. In this geothermal area the hot springs are so acidic that they have eaten pits and holes in the bedrock.

==Terminal Geyser==

Located in the southeast corner of the park, Terminal Geyser is not actually a geyser, but rather a cold stream flowing over a steam vent. This is about 100 feet (30 m) from the site of a geothermal boring operation that took place in 1962 and 1978. The 4,008-foot (1,222 m) well is now plugged and abandoned.

==Boiling Springs Lake==
Just northwest of Terminal Geyser, large, warm-water Boiling Springs Lake has many hot springs, mudpots, and fumaroles along its west shore. Unlike the more heavily visited areas of the park, this area is not developed with boardwalks or signs and offers a chance to view thermal features in a more natural setting.

In 2012, scientists studying the viruses in Boiling Springs Lake found the first known case of a natural hybrid or &quot;chimera&quot; virus, apparently made of two very different groups of viruses that recombined into a single organism. They named this &quot;mythological beast of a virus&quot; the &quot;Boiling Springs Lake RNA−DNA Hybrid Virus&quot; or &quot;BSL−RDHV&quot;. The study showed there is still much to learn about how viruses can evolve. Other types of viral hybrids have since been found elsewhere, and are called the CHIV group (&quot;chimeric viruses&quot;).

<doc id="345253" wikidata="Q2956453" url="?curid=345253" title="Chaos Crags">
<text>Chaos Crags is the youngest group of lava domes in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California. They formed as six dacite domes 1,100-1,000 years ago, one dome collapsing during an explosive eruption about 70 years later. The eruptions at the Chaos Crags mark one of just three instances of Holocene activity within the Lassen volcanic center. The cluster of domes is located north of Lassen Peak and form part of the southernmost segment of the Cascade Range in Northern California. Each year, a lake forms at the base of the Crags, and typically dries by the end of the summer season.

From the base of the and extending toward the northwest corner of the park is Chaos Jumbles, a rock avalanche that undermined Chaos Crags&#x27; northwest slope 300 years ago. Riding on a cushion of compressed air (see sturzstrom), the rock debris traveled at about , flattened the forest before it, and dammed Manzanita Creek, forming Manzanita Lake. In addition to the possibility of forming additional lava domes, future activity at the Chaos Crags could pose hazards from pumice, pyroclastic flows, or rockfalls. Geological study of the Chaos Crags, which continues today, began in the late 1920s, when Howel Williams wrote about its pyroclastic rock deposits, rockfall avalanches, and eruptions. The area is monitored for rockslide threats, which could threaten the local area.

The Crags and the surrounding area&#x27;s lakes and forests support numerous plant and animal species. The area is not a popular destination for visitors, despite its accessibility. The Chaos Crags and Crags Lake Trail, which lasts about three hours round-trip, offers views of volcanic phenomena nearby, as well as the Hat Creek valley and the Thousand Lakes Wilderness.

== Geography ==

The Chaos Crags form part of the southernmost segment of the Cascade Range in Northern California. They lie in the northwest corner of the Lassen Volcanic National Park, in Shasta County. Located to the north of Lassen Peak, they have an elevation of about . The Lassen Volcanic National Park area is surrounded by the Lassen National Forest, which has an area of . Nearby towns include Mineral in Tehama County and Viola in Shasta County.
At the base of the Crags, a lake forms temporarily each year. Known as the Crags Lake or the Chaos Crater, it forms in a depression that acts as a basin to collect melted snow during the spring season. The lake has cool temperatures near the shores, and grows colder near its center. It usually dries up by the end of August.

== Geology ==

Between 385,000 and 315,000 years ago, volcanic activity in the Lassen volcanic center shifted dramatically from building andesitic stratovolcanoes to producing lava domes made of dacite. These eruptions formed the Lassen dome field, staged as andesite lava flows surrounding two sequences of dacitic lava domes. The first sequence of lava domes, known as the Bumpass domes, formed between 300,000 and 190,000 years ago, while the production of the younger Eagle Peak domes began about 70,000 years ago. The andesite lava flows form the older and younger Twin Lakes sequences, and date to between 315,000 and 240,000 years ago and between 90,000 years ago and present, respectively. Beginning 190,000 years ago, eruptions ceased in the Lassen Volcanic center for 100,000 years. Dacitic magma at the Lassen center formed from mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) magma meeting silicic (high in silicon dioxide) magma chambers with felsic (rich in feldspar and quartz) phenocrysts. Some dacitic crystals were partially reabsorbed as a result of mixing of hot mafic magma with cool dacitic magma, and this along with undercooling of mixed magma led to phenocryst variation within certain domes exceeding variation between the domes. All three sequences — Bumpass, Eagle Peak, and Twin Lakes — formed from lava subjected to magma-mixing processes, accounting for their heterogeneous appearance and composition. Because of these mixing mechanisms, lavas may have different compositions but similar appearances, or similar compositions with different appearances. The eruption that produced the Chaos Crags consisted of more than 90% mixed magma, and likely resulted from the interaction of felsic and mafic magmas.

The Eagle Peak Sequence, which includes the Chaos Crags, consists of seven dacite and rhyodacite lava domes and lava flows, along with pyroclastic rock deposits. The Chaos Crags consist of five small lava domes, made of rhyodacite, which line up with the western edge of the Mount Tehama caldera. The youngest part of the Lassen volcanic center&#x27;s dome field and the youngest domes in the Eagle Peak sequence, they reach an elevation of about above their surroundings. They lack a summit crater.

The domes began forming about 1,100 years ago, beginning with vent-opening eruptions, then vigorous explosive eruptions of pumice and ash followed by effusive activity. This created unstable edifices that partially collapsed and formed pyroclastic flows, similar to the most recent eruptions at the Mono–Inyo Craters. Two of the pyroclastic flows were deposited as one unit, and pumice fell to build a tuff cone at the northern edge of the Crags, while lava dome A formed and magma in the eruptive conduit cooled to plug the eruptive vent. Domes B through F followed in that order, though their exact ages remain unclear. Lasting from 1125 years ago to 1060 years ago, this eruptive phase resembled the Lassen Peak eruptions in May 1915, though the Chaos Crag eruption had a magnitude 100 times greater, with an output volume of . The eruptions also created a cone made of tephra material, along with two pyroclastic flows, which had a volume of about . Six domes were originally formed, though after 70 years of quiescence, one was destroyed by a violent eruption that produced a pyroclastic flow and tephra deposits that can be detected in Manzanita and Lost Creeks. Of the five remaining domes, two have had landslides at their domes. The dome-forming eruptions at Chaos Crags, along with the eruption of Cinder Cone and the 1914–1921 eruptions of Lassen Peak, constitute the only Holocene activity within the Lassen volcanic center. The Chaos Crags event may have been fed by the same reservoir of crystal-containing magma as the 25,000BCE and 1914-1921 eruptions at Lassen Peak, based on shared zircon age spectra, composition, and phenocryst makeup, suggesting that they have all been fed by the same reservoir of crystal-containing magma. This magma chamber has recycled old magma cooling for many thousands of years, eventually heating the mixture so that it can be erupted.

Unlike Lassen Peak, which has been altered by glaciers, the Chaos Crags have been unaffected by erosion. Their surfaces remain sharp with protrusions.

Unlike the vesicular and aphyric pyroclastic rock at Glass Mountain and Little Glass Mountain, lava deposits from the Chaos Crags are porphyritic with average vesicularity values at about 30%. Most of these vesicles exhibit oval shapes. Pumice from the eruption has high phenocryst content, with crystals of plagioclase, hornblende, biotite, quartz, and magnetite; it also has low vesicularity values.

Dome F, the last dome to form, consists of porphyritic rhyodacite, with hornblende and biotite. The lava deposits are dense, with white, light-gray, and medium-gray colors and glassy to devitrified textures. The deposits also contain large amounts of quartz, especially pyroxene-rimmed quartz crystals, with sparse appearance of olivine and calcic-plagioclase xenocrysts. At dome E, the penultimate dome to be produced, non-bedded deposits with fine, granular pieces to blocks with lengths of up to occur, and many of the larger blocks have internal fractures. Domes D, C, and A have compositions that are extremely similar to dome F; dome B, too, is similar, but also has pumice deposits and mafic inclusions. At dome E and dome D, there are also talus blocks as large as in length. Partial collapses have taken place at dome D and E. There are three distinct pyroclastic flow deposits, one of which occurs underneath dome B but on top of dome A, and has coarse pumice of a white to gray color. The other two pyroclastic deposits, which were deposited as a single unit and closely resemble each other, feature fine pumice blocks in a gray to yellow matrix, with pink color on the tops of the rocks. Both units were emplaced before dome A and contain charcoalized wood dated to about 1,125 ± 15 years old.

== Chaos Jumbles ==

Roughly 350 years ago, one of the Chaos Crags domes collapsed to produce the Chaos Jumbles, an area where three enormous rockfalls in rapid succession transformed the local area and traveled as far as down the dome&#x27;s slopes. The cause remains uncertain, but might have been an earthquake. The largest rockslide moved up nearby Table Mountain, then deflected and moved west. The rockslide moved at about , partly moving on a cushion of compressed air, which lowered friction. The formation of the Jumbles covered with volcanic blocks, causing the formation of Manzanita Lake by damming Manzanita Creek. The rockfall impeded soil development and tree growth in the Chaos Jumbles area, which has been slower than in the Devastated Area near Lassen Peak.

The Chaos Jumbles deposits from the collapsed dome consist of lobed, non-bedded coarse to fine rubble, with blocks reaching widths of . The debris includes pink, oxidized rhyodacite lava blocks, with rare prismatically jointed, gray blocks and andesite deposits from Mount Tehama.

=== Potential hazards and monitoring ===

In a 1974 report by the United States Geological Survey, scientists wrote that &quot;some of the most catastrophic geologic events of the recent past resulted directly or indirectly from volcanism at the site of the Chaos Crags.&quot; Pyroclastic flows and avalanches from the formation reached the areas where parts of the Manzanita Lake visitor center facilities now reside. If the Chaos Crags resumed activity, they could erupt pumice, pyroclastic flows, or swift rockfalls, in addition to creating lava domes, though these would not pose major threats to human life should the surrounding area be evacuated promptly. These pyroclastic flows could reach regions directly surrounding the eruptive volcanic vent, and would extend at least into the nearby valley floors. The extent of tephra deposits would depend on wind strength and directions. However, given the sudden nature of rockfall-avalanches, these would be more dangerous than pyroclastic flows or tephra, as they could occur without warning, seriously endangering life within of the Crags.

The Chaos Crags are monitored for movement in case of future rockslides by the United States Geological Survey; GPS receivers have been in place to monitor deformation within the Lassen volcanic center since 2008. Thirteen seismometers in the vicinity, first installed in 1976 and since updated each decade, continually survey earthquakes within the locale.

== Ecology ==
Like the nearby Devastated Area by Lassen Peak, the Chaos Jumbles have skipped the usual plant regrowth phase dominated by herbaceous plants, moving directly to conifer regrowth. Crags Lake hosts tadpoles and many frogs. The vegetation there is dominated by sugar pines, with sparse white firs and Jeffrey pines. There is also a small chokecherry tree at the eastern edge of the lake.

Throughout Lassen Volcanic National Park, forests can be found featuring red fir, mountain alder, western white pine, white fir, lodgepole pine, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, juniper, and live oak. Other plants found in the area consist of coyote mint, lupines, mule&#x27;s ears, ferns, corn lilies, red mountain heathers, pinemat manzanitas,
greenleaf manzanitas, bush chinquapins, catchflies, Fremont&#x27;s butterweed, buckwheat, granite gilia, mountain pride, mariposa tulips, creambush, and a variety of chaparral shrubs.

The various habitats in the Lassen Volcanic National Park support about 300 vertebrate species like mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and birds, including bald eagles, which are listed as &quot;Threatened&quot; under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and peregrine falcons, which were removed from the endangered species list in 1999. In forested areas below , animals include American black bears, mule deer, martens, brown creepers, mountain chickadees, white-headed woodpeckers, long-toed salamanders, and several bat species. At higher elevations, Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers, deer mice, and chipmunks can be found among mountain hemlock stands, and subalpine zones with sparse vegetation host populations of gray-crowned rosy finches, pikas, and golden-mantled ground squirrels. Among scattered stands of pinemat manzanita, red fir, and lodgepole pine, animals include dark-eyed juncos, montane voles, and sagebrush lizards. Meadows at the bottoms of valleys along streams and lakes support Pacific tree frogs, Western terrestrial garter snakes, common snipes, and mountain pocket gophers. Other animals found within the national park area include snakes like rubber boas, common garter snakes, and striped whipsnakes; cougars; amphibians like newts, salamanders, rough-skinned newts, and Cascades frogs; 216 species of birds including MacGillivray&#x27;s warblers, Wilson&#x27;s warblers, song sparrows, spotted owls, northern goshawks, and bufflehead ducks; five species of native fish that include rainbow trout, tui chubs, speckled daces, Lahontan redsides, and Tahoe suckers; and four invasive fish species including brook trout, brown trout, golden shiners, and fathead minnows. Prominent invertebrate species include California tortoiseshell butterflies.

== Human history ==
The Chaos Crags were known to the Whitney Survey, and were observed by Brewer and King in 1863. The name Chaos Crags was officially recognized by the Board on Geographic Names Decisions in 1927.

Geological study of the Chaos Crags began in the late 1920s, when Howel Williams wrote about its pyroclastic rock deposits, rockfall avalanches, and the dome-producing eruptions. Though Williams initially suggested that volcanic activity and the ensuing landslides took place about 200 years ago, additional study of the rockfalls by James P. Heath placed their age between 1,500 and 300 years ago. This was followed by mapping of the Manzanita Lake and Prospect Peak quadrangles in the 1960s by Gordon A. Macdonald.

In 1974, the National Park Service closed the visitor center and accommodations at Manzanita Lake, fearing that these buildings would be in the way of a rockslide from Chaos Crags if an earthquake or volcanic eruption occurred in the area. In 2011, twenty wooden cabins, along with picnic tables, fire rings, and food lockers, were reinstalled in the Manzanita Lake Campground. It had been determined in the 1980s that the rockslide danger had been overstated by the USGS (after the cabins were torn down), and therefore, the cabins were reintroduced to the park for nightly rental.

== Recreation ==
The Chaos Crags and Crags Lake Trail, which lasts about three hours round-trip, spans , commencing at Manzanita Camp Road and traveling through a forested area next to the Jumbles. Gaining in elevation, the trail offers views of the Jumbles, the Crags, and the pyroclastic flow deposits, in addition to the Hat Creek valley and the Thousand Lakes Wilderness. Crags Lake can be reached after about of the trail and can be used for swimming. Despite its accessibility, the area receives relatively few visitors, and swimming conditions are usually poor given the small size of the lake. An additional trail runs around Manzanita Lake.

<doc id="345255" wikidata="Q201900" url="?curid=345255" title="Rüştü Reçber">
<text>Rüştü Reçber (; born 10 May 1973) is a Turkish former professional footballer and a current sports executive. During his professional career, he played as a goalkeeper for Antalyaspor, Fenerbahçe, Barcelona and Beşiktaş.

Rüştü was part of the Turkey national squad that reached the semi-finals at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2008. At the former, where Turkey finished third, his performances saw him selected for the tournament&#x27;s all-star team. He is Turkey&#x27;s record appearance holder, having earned 120 caps. He made his debut against Iceland in 1994 and his final appearance came against Finland in 2012.

Rüştü was named the best goalkeeper in European competitions in 2002, selected for the 2002 UEFA Team of the Year by public vote. In 2004, he was selected to FIFA 100 by Pelé as one of the 125 best living footballers in the world.

==Club career==

===1985–2003: early years and Fenerbahçe===
Born in Korkuteli, Rüştü began his career at nearby Antalyaspor, having converted from a forward to a goalkeeper. Early in his career, he missed out on moves to two of the Istanbul-based Big Three of Turkish football: he rejected Galatasaray at the age of 17 because coach Mustafa Denizli wanted him to start off at the youth team, and in 1993 a move to Beşiktaş fell through when he was seriously injured in a car crash.

After debuting for Turkey under-21, Rüştü was told by national manager Fatih Terim in 1992 that he would become the greatest goalkeeper in the nation&#x27;s history. In 1993, he joined the last remaining of the Big Three, Fenerbahçe, spending his first season back on loan at Antalyaspor. He gained his big break in October 1994, when club and national starting goalkeeper Engin İpekoğlu injured his foot against Kayserispor; he debuted against Petrol Ofisi and went on to make 240 appearances in his first spell, also becoming captain and winning the Süper Lig twice.

===2003–2004: Barcelona===
In July 2003, Rüştü was very close to signing for Arsenal, but he had a dispute with manager Arsène Wenger who he felt insulted his fitness. Instead, he joined La Liga club Barcelona. After manager Frank Rijkaard chose to play Víctor Valdés in the first two league matches because Rüştü&#x27;s Spanish was still very weak. Rüştü was upset by this, saying &quot;It is not normal for a goalkeeper of my history and caliber to be left out because I don&#x27;t speak Spanish.&quot;

Rüştü made his debut on 15 October 2003 in the UEFA Cup first round second leg at home to Slovakia&#x27;s MŠK Púchov, an 8–0 win. He totalled only seven games – four in the league, of which the first was a 3–1 win at Espanyol in the Derbi barceloní on 13 December.

===2004–2012: return to Fenerbahçe, Beşiktaş===

Having played just four league games (seven overall), Rüştü was loaned back to Fenerbahçe on 27 August 2004 for the season. On 28 July 2005, this was extended for another year. In his combined two spells, Rüştü is the Fenerbahçe goalkeeper with second-most appearances, with 294 games, following Volkan Demirel.

After winning the league title for a third time with Fenerbahçe in 2006–07, Rüştü moved to city rivals Beşiktaş on a three-year deal, along with teammate Mehmet Yozgatlı. Rüştü won the league with his new team in 2008–09. He also won 2010–11 Turkish Cup where he played all 120 minutes, including penalties, as the club won the tournament.

==International career==

===2002 FIFA World Cup===

Turkey finished third in the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan. Rüştü was one of two goalkeepers in the 16-man Team of the Tournament, alongside Germany&#x27;s Oliver Kahn.

On 26 March 2005, captain Rüştü earned his 100th cap in a 2–0 home win over Albania in 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification.

===Euro 2008===
With first choice goalkeeper Volkan Demirel suspended, Rüştü started the UEFA Euro 2008 quarter-final match against Croatia. A questionable foray from his goalmouth allowed Croatia to score the match&#x27;s first goal with a minute remaining in extra time. Rüştü immediately made amends for his mistake though, assisting on Semih Şentürk&#x27;s injury time goal in the 122nd minute. In the ensuing penalty shootout, he faced four kicks, saving the last one from Mladen Petrić to secure Turkey&#x27;s victory in the shootout and enabling Turkey to progress to the Euro semi-finals for the first time ever.

In the aftermath of the 3–2 semi-final loss to Germany, a game in which he was captain, he announced his retirement from the national team. However, he was since called up against Spain for a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match. He was called up for the last time for Turkey in a game against Finland on 26 May 2012, the last of his 120 caps.

==Style of play==
Rüştü was renowned as a gifted shot-stopper, possessed an excellent positional sense. Using his height, he was also able to come up for high balls. He also possessed strong reflexes and good deflecting ability. Known as a penalty stopper, his shoot-out performance against Croatia in the UEFA Euro 2008 quarter-finals was described as &quot;heroic&quot; by UEFA in 2015. He was featured in a UEFA Training Ground series video under the title of &quot;Rüştü&#x27;s Turkish Delight&quot;, in which he was described as a &quot;Master of Penalties&quot;. He was an eccentric goalkeeper, who also stood out for his charismatic personality. Physically, he was recognisable for his long hair and anti-glare paint under his eyes. He was also adept at taking goal kicks and clearing backpasses.

==Personal life==
Rüştü is married to Işıl Reçber (née: &quot;Kepe&quot;) and the couple have a son and a daughter. The couple first met in period when Rüştü just signed for Fenerbahçe from Antalyaspor, in 1994. Rüştü used to be a Galatasaray supporter in his childhood. His son, Burak, born in 2007, plays football at Galatasaray academy.

In March 2020, Reçber tested positive for COVID-19 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. He was admitted to hospital for care where he was put under isolation. He was discharged in April.

<doc id="345258" wikidata="Q2181467" url="?curid=345258" title="Cinder Cone and the Fantastic Lava Beds">
<text>Cinder Cone is a cinder cone volcano in Lassen Volcanic National Park within the United States. It is located about northeast of Lassen Peak and provides an excellent view of Brokeoff Mountain, Lassen Peak, and Chaos Crags.

The cone was built to a height of above the surrounding area and spread ash over . Then, like many cinder cones, it was snuffed out when several basalt lava flows erupted from its base. These flows, called the Fantastic Lava Beds, spread northeast and southwest, and dammed creeks, first creating Snag Lake on the south and then Butte Lake to the north. Butte Lake is fed by water from Snag Lake seeping through the lava beds. Nobles Emigrant Trail goes around Snag Lake and follows the edge of the lava beds.

Its age has been controversial since the 1870s, when many people thought it was only a few decades old. Later, the cone and associated lava flows were thought to have formed about 1700 or during a 300-year- long series of eruptions ending in 1851. Recent studies by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists, working in cooperation with the National Park Service to better understand volcanic hazards in the Lassen area, have firmly established that Cinder Cone was formed during two eruptions that occurred in the 1650s.

== Geography ==
Cinder Cone lies in Lassen and Shasta counties, in Northern California, within the United States. Located southwest of Butte Lake and southeast of Prospect Peak (which dwarfs Cinder Cone), it is also sometimes referred to as Black Butte or Cinder Butte. The volcano lies in the northeastern corner of Lassen Volcanic National Park.

Nearby Snag Lake formed when lava known as the Painted Dunes flows dammed the Grassy Creek stream, which is fed by water from the central plateau of the national park area. Water from this lake feeds Butte Lake, located to the north. Butte Lake is the sole remaining fragment of a much larger body of water filled with lava during Cinder Cone&#x27;s eruptive period. Diatomite sediment, formed from the aggregation of diatoms on the lake&#x27;s floor, run along the edges of the Fantastic Lava Beds and mark the margins of this former lake.

== Description and geology ==
Cinder Cone is a -high volcanic cone of loose scoria. The youngest mafic volcano in the Lassen volcanic center, it is surrounded by unvegetated block lava and has concentric craters at its summit, which have diameters of and . Cinder Cone comprises five basaltic andesite and andesite lava flows, and it also has two cinder cone volcanoes, with two scoria cones, the first of which was mostly destroyed by lava flows from its base. Cinder cone volcanoes are typically monogenetic, meaning that they only undergo one eruptive period before ceasing activity forever. These eruptions often consist of the ejection of tephra, though they may also generate lava flows, which often originate from vents near the base rather than the summit of the volcanic edifice.

The summit of Cinder Cone has a crater with a double rim (photo), probably created by two different phases of one eruptive period. The cone also has a widespread ash deposit identifiable for from the cone. Blocks of red, cemented scoria within the Painted Dunes lava flows (photo) are pieces of this earlier cone, which were carried away by the flowing lava.

When Cinder Cone formed, the magma feeding the eruption changed composition, shifting from basaltic andesite to andesite before returning to basaltic andesite with increased titanium content. While basaltic andesites are volcanic rocks containing 53 to 57% silica, andesites are those containing 57 to 63% silica. The lava flows and scorias at the volcano closely resemble each other despite distinct chemical compositions, forming dark, fine-grained rocks, with a few visible crystals of the minerals olivine, plagioclase, and quartz.

The early group of volcanic deposits at Cinder Cone, which have relatively little titanium, include older scoria cone, the Old Bench flow, the two Painted Dunes flows, and the lower part of the widespread ash layer. The second group, erupted later and comparatively rich in titanium, consists of the large, younger scoria cone, the upper part of the ash layer, and the two Fantastic Lava Beds flows. Radiocarbon dating places these occurrences between 1630 and 1670 CE. At the Old Bench and Painted Dunes lava flows, the volcanic ash is brightly oxidized because it interacted with the lava flows when they were still hot. It shares its compositional group with the Fantastic Lava Beds flows, which represent the last flows erupted at Cinder Cone. Ultimately, the eruptive sequence at Cinder Cone took place over the course of several months.

An unusual characteristic of the Fantastic Lava Beds is the presence of anomalous quartz crystal xenocrysts (foreign bodies in igneous rock). Geologists think that they were picked up from wall rocks by the lava as it moved toward the surface.

==Human history==

===Beginnings of a controversy===
After traveling through Northern California in the spring of 1851, two gold prospectors reported seeing an erupting volcano that &quot;threw up fire to a terrible height&quot; and that they had walked for over rocks that burned through their boots. This narrative complemented several accounts of activity at the volcano across 1850 and 1851, which all claimed to observe the eruptions from at least away.

During the early 1870s, medical doctor and amateur scientist H. W. Harkness from San Francisco, California, visited the Cinder Cone area. Intrigued by the &quot;apparent youthfulness&quot; of the area&#x27;s volcanic landmarks, he observed several features to argue that Cinder Cone was only about 25 years old. He presented his conclusions at a meeting of the California Academy of Sciences, and was contacted by Academy member Henry Chapman, who informed him of the gold prospector story. A number of other people reached out to Harkness about seeing volcanic activity in Lassen in about 1851, such as O. M. Wozencraft, which led Harkness to think that Cinder Cone had erupted recently.

Though there were multiple reports of eruptive activity near Lassen in Northern California newspapers during the 1850s, the details remain inconsistent. The first such report, which was published in the August 21, 1850, edition of the &quot;Daily Pacific News&quot; (a San Francisco newspaper), cited an unnamed observer who claimed to have seen &quot;burning lava still running down the sides&quot; at Cinder Cone. In 1859, the &quot;San Francisco Times&quot; published an article with testimony from Wozencraft and a companion in which they claimed to have seen flames in the sky from a volcanic eruption from a location west of the Lassen area. Receiving widespread attention, the article was widely reprinted, despite the fact that the account lacked specific dates or locations for their claims. Poking fun at Wozencraft&#x27;s claims, the &quot;Shasta Republican&quot; wrote several times throughout April 1859 that &quot;the Dr.&#x27;s imagination is far more active than any volcano in our County or State.&quot; Harkness&#x27; 1875 report cites the date of Wozencraft&#x27;s sighting to be the winter of 1850–1851.

===Early geologic studies===
The first geologist to study Cinder Cone was Joseph Diller. One of the first USGS scientists to study volcanoes, Diller took careful notes on Cinder Cone and interviewed many Native Americans and European trappers and settlers inhabiting the Lassen region during 1850, none of whom remembered volcanic activity there. Aware of an &quot;emigrant road&quot; (the Nobles Emigrant Trail), which had been utilized by settlers coming to California in the early 1850s, that passes close to the base of Cinder Cone, he interviewed a number of people who &quot;crossed the trail&quot; in 1853. They noted that a large, solitary willow bush (&quot;Salix scouleriana&quot;) near the summit of Cinder Cone had not been destroyed by any eruptive activity. The bush is still alive and has not been altered much since.

Because the willow at the summit of Cinder Cone was already mature in 1853, Diller concluded it was extremely unlikely that an eruption could have occurred there in the winter of 1850. He also noted that trees rooted in volcanic ash erupted from the cone were about 200 years old and that the oldest trees on related lava flows were about 150 years old. Diller believed he recognized two eruptive sequences, which each produced lava flows. However, he thought that only the older eruption was explosive, creating Cinder Cone and the ash deposits. In regard to the explosive eruption, he concluded that &quot;Whatever may be the historical testimony as to the time of the eruption, the geologic evidence clearly demonstrates that it must have occurred long before the beginning of the present century&quot; (before 1800). Diller therefore speculated that the explosive eruption had occurred between about 1675 and 1700 and that the younger, quiet eruption was &quot;certainly&quot; sometime before 1840.

On May 6, 1907, both Cinder Cone and Lassen Peak were designated national monuments, administered by the National Forest Service. Cinder Cone&#x27;s name was officially recognized by the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1927. In the mid-1930s, USGS volcanologist R. H. Finch attempted to improve on Diller&#x27;s work. On the basis of other studies done at Cinder Cone, Finch thought (1) that there had been at least five separate lava-flow events, as suggested by crude, experimental magnetic measurements; (2) that the youngest lava flow was extruded in 1851, accepting Harkness&#x27; (1875) historical &quot;evidence&quot; and ignoring Diller&#x27;s interviews and conclusions; and (3) that there had been at least two distinct explosive eruptions of the cone. Using these assumptions and tree-ring measurements, Finch proposed a complex and detailed eruptive chronology for Cinder Cone that spanned nearly 300 years. From measurements of the rings of one particular tree, which showed two periods of slow growth, he thought that the two explosive eruptions occurred in 1567 and 1666. He also concluded that the five lava flows were extruded in 1567, 1666, 1720, 1785, and 1851.

===New geologic studies===
After Finch published his work in 1937, few additional studies were done on volcanic hazards in the Lassen area. However, that changed after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington. As a result, the USGS began reevaluating the risks posed by other potentially active volcanoes in the Cascade Range, including those in Lassen Volcanic National Park. Since that time, USGS scientists have been working in cooperation with the National Park Service to better understand volcanic hazards in the Lassen area. As part of this work, the history of Cinder Cone has been reexamined. Most of the features of Cinder Cone have changed little since Harkness first described them in the 1870s, but all of the assumptions on which Finch based his conclusions have now been shown to be incorrect.

Through new field and laboratory work and by reinterpreting data from previous studies, USGS scientists have shown that the entire eruptive sequence at Cinder Cone represents a single continuous event. Because the orientation of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field in northern California during the 1850s is well known and is different from the remnant magnetizations at Cinder Cone, the lava flows there could not have been erupted in 1850 or 1852. Also, there are no discernible differences in the magnetic orientation recorded by any of the Cinder Cone lava flows, and so the flows had to be extruded during an interval of less than 50 years.

Although paleomagnetic evidence can be used to rule out the 1850s as the age of Cinder Cone, it does not provide an actual age for its eruption. By measuring levels of carbon-14 in samples of wood from trees killed by the eruption of Cinder Cone, USGS scientists obtained a radiocarbon date for the eruption of between 1630 and 1670. Such a date is also consistent with the remnant magnetization preserved in the lava flows. The series of eruptions that produced the volcanic deposits at Cinder Cone were complex and are by no means completely understood. However, the new studies done by USGS scientists refute the purported accounts of an eruption in the early 1850s and confirm Diller&#x27;s (1891, 1893) interpretation that Cinder Cone erupted in the latter half of the 17th century. They also suggest that the 1666 tree-ring date proposed by Finch (1937) for his &quot;second&quot; explosive eruption at Cinder Cone might actually date the entire eruptive sequence.

<doc id="345261" wikidata="Q434371" url="?curid=345261" title="Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives">
<text>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), commonly referred to as the ATF, is a domestic law enforcement agency within the United States Department of Justice. Its responsibilities include the investigation and prevention of federal offenses involving the unlawful use, manufacture, and possession of firearms and explosives; acts of arson and bombings; and illegal trafficking and tax evasion of alcohol and tobacco products. 

The ATF also regulates via licensing the sale, possession, and transportation of firearms, ammunition, and explosives in interstate commerce. Many of the ATF&#x27;s activities are carried out in conjunction with task forces made up of state and local law enforcement officers, such as Project Safe Neighborhoods. 

The ATF operates a unique fire research laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, where full-scale mock-ups of criminal arson can be reconstructed. The ATF had 5,285 employees and an annual budget of almost $1.5 billion in 2021. The ATF has received criticism over its handling of the investigation leading up to the Ruby Ridge standoff, the Waco siege and &quot;...has a history of abuse and incompetence.&quot;

==History==

The ATF was formerly part of the United States Department of the Treasury, having been formed in 1886 as the &quot;Revenue Laboratory&quot; within the Treasury Department&#x27;s Bureau of Internal Revenue. The history of the ATF can be subsequently traced to the time of the revenuers or &quot;revenoors&quot; and the Bureau of Prohibition, which was formed as a unit of the Bureau of Internal Revenue in 1920. It was made an independent agency within the Treasury Department in 1927, was transferred to the Justice Department in 1930, and became, briefly, a division of the FBI in 1933.

When the Volstead Act, which established Prohibition in the United States, was repealed in December 1933, the Unit was transferred from the Department of Justice back to the Department of the Treasury, where it became the Alcohol Tax Unit (ATU) of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Special Agent Eliot Ness and several members of The Untouchables, who had worked for the Prohibition Bureau while the Volstead Act was still in force, were transferred to the ATU. In 1942, responsibility for enforcing federal firearms laws was given to the ATU.

In the early 1950s, the Bureau of Internal Revenue was renamed &quot;Internal Revenue Service&quot; (IRS), and the ATU was given the additional responsibility of enforcing federal tobacco tax laws. At this time, the name of the ATU was changed to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division (ATTD).

In 1968, with the passage of the Gun Control Act, the agency changed its name again, this time to the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division of the IRS and first began to be referred to by the initials &quot;ATF&quot;. In Title XI of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Congress enacted the Explosives Control Act, 18 U.S.C.A. Chapter 40, which provided for close regulation of the explosives industry and designated certain arsons and bombings as federal crimes. The Secretary of the Treasury was made responsible for administering the regulatory aspects of the new law, and was given jurisdiction over criminal violations relating to the regulatory controls. These responsibilities were delegated to the ATF division of the IRS. The Secretary and the Attorney General were given concurrent jurisdiction over arson and bombing offenses. Pub.L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, October 15, 1970.

In 1972, the ATF was officially established as an independent bureau within the Treasury Department on July 1, 1972, this transferred the responsibilities of the ATF division of the IRS to the new Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Rex D. Davis oversaw the transition, becoming the bureau&#x27;s first director, having headed the division since 1970. During his tenure, Davis shepherded the organization into a new era where federal firearms and explosives laws addressing violent crime became the primary mission of the agency. However, taxation and other alcohol issues remained priorities as the ATF collected billions of dollars in alcohol and tobacco taxes, and undertook major revisions of the federal wine labeling regulations relating to use of appellations of origin and varietal designations on wine labels.

In the wake of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush signed into law the Homeland Security Act of 2002. In addition to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the law shifted ATF from the Department of the Treasury to the Department of Justice. The agency&#x27;s name was changed to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. However, the agency still was referred to as &quot;the ATF&quot; for all purposes. Additionally, the task of collection of federal tax revenue derived from the production of tobacco and alcohol products and the regulatory function related to protecting the public in issues related to the production of alcohol, previously handled by the Bureau of Internal Revenue as well as by ATF, was transferred to the newly established Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), which remained within the Treasury Department. These changes took effect January 24, 2003.

===Activities===
====1972–2000====
Complaints regarding the techniques used by ATF in their effort to generate firearm cases led to hearings before Congressional committees in the late 1970s and 1980s. At these hearings, evidence was received from citizens who had been charged by ATF, from experts who had studied ATF, and from officials of the bureau itself. A Senate subcommittee report stated, &quot;Based upon these hearings it is apparent that ATF enforcement tactics made possible by current federal firearms laws are constitutionally, legally, and practically reprehensible.&quot; The Subcommittee received evidence that ATF primarily devoted its firearms enforcement efforts to the apprehension, upon technical &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; charges, of individuals who lack all criminal intent and knowledge. Evidence received demonstrated that ATF agents tended to concentrate upon collector&#x27;s items rather than &quot;criminal street guns&quot;. In hearings before ATF&#x27;s Appropriations Subcommittee, testimony was submitted estimating that 75 percent of ATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens with no criminal intent. The Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 addressed some of the abuses noted in the 1982 Senate Judiciary Subcommittee report.

===Ruby Ridge Siege controversy===

The Ruby Ridge standoff began in June 1990. Randy Weaver sold two unregistered short barrel shotguns to Kenneth Fadeley, an ATF informant. This transaction was recorded and presented to the court. Weaver&#x27;s court date was changed to the day after his original day but Weaver was not notified, and did not appear. Weaver refused to face his accusers and became a fugitive from justice. He maintained the barrels were a legal length, but after Fadeley took possession, the shotguns were later found to be shorter than allowed by federal law, requiring registration as a short-barreled shotgun and payment of a $200 tax. The ATF brought firearms charges against Weaver, but offered to drop the charges if he would become an informant. After Weaver refused to cooperate, ATF passed on false information about Weaver to other agencies that became part of a misleading file that profiled Weaver as having explosive booby traps, tunnels, and bunkers at his home; growing marijuana; having felony convictions; and being a bank robber. 

At his later trial, the gun charges were determined to be entrapment and Weaver was acquitted. However, Weaver missed a February 20, 1991, court date because U.S. Probation Officer Richins mistakenly told Weaver that the trial date was March 20, and the US Marshals Service (USMS) was charged with bringing Weaver in. Weaver remained with his family in their mountain top cabin. On August 21, 1992, a USMS surveillance team encountered Weaver, a friend and family members on a trail near the cabin, resulting in a shootout that killed US Marshal Bill Degan, Weaver&#x27;s son Samuel, and Weaver&#x27;s pet dog. FBI Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) members surrounded the cabin. The next day, HRT sniper Lon Horiuchi fired at Weaver, missing and killing Weaver&#x27;s wife. A subsequent Department of Justice review and a Congressional hearing raised several questions about the actions of ATF, USMS, USAO, and FBI HRT and the mishandling of intelligence at the USMS and FBI headquarters. The Ruby Ridge incident has become a lightning rod for legal activists within the gun rights community.

=== Rodney King riots ===
On May 1, 1992, 50 ATF agents were summoned upon to provide extra support for local police departments in Los Angeles County in response to the ongoing Rodney King riots. The next day, the ATF activated its Special Response Team tactical unit to escort firefighters in high-risk areas, pair up with local police in protecting certain establishments, and execute search warrants for looted firearms. During the riots, a total of 4,690 firearms were looted and stolen; over the next 10 days, ATF recovered fewer than 200 firearms.

===Waco Siege controversy===

The ATF was involved in the Waco Siege against the Branch Davidian religious sect near Waco, Texas, on February 28, 1993. ATF agents, accompanied by the press, conducted a raid to execute a federal search warrant on the sect&#x27;s compound, known as Mt. Carmel. The Branch Davidians were alerted to the upcoming warrant execution, but ATF raid leaders pressed on, despite knowing the advantage of surprise was lost. (ATF Director Steve Higgins had promised Treasury Under Secretary for Enforcement Ron Noble that the Waco raid would be canceled if the ATF undercover agent Robert Rodriguez reported that the element of surprise had been lost.) The resulting exchange of gunfire killed six Davidians and four ATF agents. FBI HRT later took over the scene and a 51-day stand-off ensued, ending on April 19, 1993, after the complex caught fire. 

The follow-up investigation revealed the bodies of seventy-six people including twenty children inside the compound. A grand jury found that the deaths were suicides or otherwise caused by people inside the building. Shortly after the raid, the bureau&#x27;s director, Stephen E. Higgins, retired early from his position. In December 1994, two ATF supervisory agents, Phillip J. Chojnacki and Charles D. Sarabyn, who were suspended for their roles in leading the Waco raid were reinstated, with full back pay and benefits (with a demotion) despite a Treasury Department report of gross negligence. The incident was removed from their personnel files.

===Domestic terrorism towards ATF===

Timothy McVeigh cited Ruby Ridge and Waco Siege as his motivation for the Oklahoma City Bombing, which took place on April 19, 1995, exactly two years after the end of the Waco Siege. McVeigh&#x27;s criterion for attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.
Until the September 11, 2001, attacks, the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States, and remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in the country&#x27;s history. McVeigh was executed for this mass murder by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana.

====2000–present====

The ATF was criticized for poor planning leading up to a shootout at Stevenson Ranch, California, in 2001, which resulted in the immediate deaths of a deputy sheriff as well as the suspect, and the later suicide of ATF agent Jeff Ryan.

Following the attacks on September 11, 2001, the ATF expanded regulations covering fuels used in amateur rocketry, including ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP). Two rocketry clubs, the National Association of Rocketry (NAR) and the Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA), argued that APCP is not explosive and that the ATF&#x27;s regulations were unreasonable. The NAR and TRA won their lawsuit against the ATF in 2009, lifting the government restrictions. The associations maintain their own restrictions, and rocketry is also regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Between May 2004 and August 2005, ATF agents, in conjunction with Virginia state, county, and city police, conducted an operation at eight gun shows in the Richmond area to reduce straw purchases for criminals. In a February 2006 House subcommittee hearing, the show&#x27;s owner said: &quot;People were approached and discouraged from purchasing guns. Before attempting to purchase, they were interrogated and accused of being in the business without a license, detained in police vehicles, and gun buyer&#x27;s homes were visited by police, and much more.&quot; A gun salesman testified that he was singled out for harassment by two ATF agents. The owner of a gun shop testified that he thought agents questioned female customers too often. He said that times had changed and more women were shopping for guns, adding: &quot;It seems, however, to be the prevailing opinion for law enforcement at the gun show that any woman who brings a male friend for advice or support must be making a straw purchase.&quot; A private investigator said the National Rifle Association (NRA) contracted her to go to Richmond to investigate dozens of complaints by NRA members of &quot;massive law enforcement presence, residence checks, and minority buyers being followed, pulled over and their legally purchased guns seized.&quot; The purchasers were compelled by an ATF letter to appear at ATF offices to explain and justify their purchases. ATF stated this was a pilot program that ATF was planning to apply throughout the country. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, ATF agents visited a gun show&#x27;s customers&#x27; homes a week after the show, demanding to see the buyers&#x27; guns or sale paperwork and arresting those who could not—or would not—comply.

A September 2008 report by the Justice Department&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General determined that 76 firearms and 418 laptop computers were lost, stolen, or missing from ATF, after a 59-month audit period between 2002 and 2007.

In May 2008, William Newell, Special Agent in charge of the Phoenix ATF Office, said: &quot;When 90 percent-plus of the firearms recovered from these violent drug cartels are from a U.S. source, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to stem the illegal flow of these firearms to these thugs.&quot; According to the Justice Department&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General, &quot;ATF told the OIG that the 90-percent figure ... could be misleading because it applied only to the small portion of Mexican crime guns that are traced.&quot; Under operations &quot;Fast and Furious&quot;, &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot;, and &quot;Wide Receiver&quot;, indictments show that the Phoenix ATF Office, over protests from the gun dealers and some ATF agents involved and without notifying Mexican authorities, facilitated the sale of over 2,500 firearms (AK-47 rifles, FN 5.7mm pistols, and .50 caliber rifles) to traffickers destined for Mexico. Many of these same guns are being recovered from crime scenes in Arizona and throughout Mexico, which is artificially inflating ATF&#x27;s eTrace statistics of U.S. origin guns seized in Mexico. One gun is alleged to be the weapon used by a Mexican national to murder Customs and Border Protection Agent Brian Terry on December 14, 2010. ATF and DOJ denied all allegations. After appearing at a Congressional Hearing, three supervisors of Fast and Furious (William G. McMahon, Newell, and David Voth) were reported as being transferred and promoted by ATF. ATF denied the transfers were promotions.

In June 2011, Vince Cefalu, an ATF special agent for 24 years who in December 2010 exposed ATF&#x27;s Project Gunrunner scandal, was notified of his termination. Two days before the termination, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter to the ATF warning officials not to retaliate against whistleblowers. Cefalu&#x27;s dismissal followed allegations that ATF retaliates against whistleblowers. ATF spokesman Drew Wade denied that the bureau is retaliating but declined to comment about Cefalu&#x27;s case.

In 2015, a proposal by the ATF to prohibit sales of certain 5.56 x 45mm ammunition was dropped following a negative response from the public and the legislature.

In 2022, the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit which found that &quot;thousands of firearms, firearm parts, and ammunition had been stolen from National Firearms and Ammunition Destruction (NFAD) from 2016 to 2019.&quot; The NFAD is the branch of the ATF uses to dispose of firearms forfeited to the ATF. The report also stated that the ATF has improved its process to reduce thefts but that it still has not implemented all of the recommendations made by the DOJ.

In 2023, federal Judge Reed O&#x27;Connor of the Northern District of Texas vacated the Bureau&#x27;s attempt to expand the definition of a firearm frame or receiver. Judge O&#x27;Connor ruled ATF exceeded its statutory authority in attempting to redefine these terms and implement regulations of so-called &quot;readily convertible&quot; or &quot;80% receiver&quot; kits.

===Director confirmation controversy===
In 2006, the National Rifle Association (NRA) lobbied U.S. Representative F. James Sensenbrenner to add a provision to the Patriot Act reauthorization that requires Senate confirmation of ATF director nominees. (Prior to that, ATF directors were simply appointed by the administration.) After that, the NRA lobbied against and effectively blocked all but one presidential nominee until 2022.

In 2007, President George W. Bush nominated Mike Sullivan for the position, a U.S. Attorney from Boston with a good reputation, but Republican Sens. Larry Craig and Michael D. Crapo, both from Idaho, blocked his confirmation after complaints from an Idaho firearms dealer. In 2010, President Barack Obama nominated Andrew L. Traver, head of the ATF&#x27;s Denver division, to fill the top spot, but the Senate never held his confirmation hearings. The NRA strongly opposed Traver&#x27;s nomination.

Subsequent failed nominations included Fraternal Order of Police president Chuck Canterbury (nominated by Donald Trump) and former ATF agent David Chipman (nominated by Joe Biden).

B. Todd Jones was nominated by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate as permanent ATF director on July 31, 2013, serving until March 31, 2015. Jones was the only successful Senate-approved appointment until the Senate confirmed Steve Dettelbach in July 2022. Dettelbach&#x27;s confirmation required a procedural maneuver to advance his nomination out of Senate Judiciary committee. It passed the evenly-divided Senate due to two Republicans voting with the Democrats to confirm.

===Violent crime===
Since 2001, ATF agents have recommended over 10,000 felons every year for federal prosecution for firearms possession through the Project Safe Neighborhoods framework. In PSN&#x27;s first year, 2001–2002, over 7,700 of these cases resulted in convictions with an average sentence of over five years per defendant. This number had risen to over 12,000 prosecutions in FY 2007. The annual FBI Uniform Crime Report (UCR) demonstrated that from 2001 to 2010, the reduction of violent crime offenses in United States districts with dedicated Project Safe Neighborhood Agents and United States Attorneys far outperformed the national average. An outgrowth of the Project Safe Neighborhoods framework was the creation of Violent Crime Impact Teams which worked proactively to identify, disrupt, arrest and prosecute the most violent criminals through innovative technology, analytical investigative resources and an integrated federal, state and local law enforcement strategy.

Generally, about 90% of the cases referred by ATF for prosecution each year are for firearms, violent crime, and narcotics offenses. Through the first half of 2011, ATF (with fewer than 2,000 active Special Agents) had recommended 5,203 cases for prosecution. 

==Personnel==
ATF, as a bureau, consists of several different groups that each have their own respective role, commanded by a director. Special Agents are empowered to conduct criminal investigations, defend the United States against international and domestic terrorism, and work with state and local police officers to reduce violent crime on a national level. ATF Special Agents may carry firearms, serve warrants and subpoenas issued under the authority of the United States and make arrests without warrant for any offense against the United States committed in their presence, or for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such felony . Specifically, ATF Special Agents have lead investigative authority on any federal crime committed with a firearm or explosive, as well as investigative authority over regulatory referrals and cigarette smuggling. 

All ATF Special Agents require a Top Secret (TS) security clearance, and in many instances, need a higher level, TS/SCI/SAP (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information/Special Access Programs) clearance. In order to get a security clearance, all potential ATF Special Agents must pass a detailed series of Single Scope Background Investigations (SSBI). ATF Special Agents consistently rank at the top or near the top of all federal agencies in cases referred for prosecution, arrests made, and average time per defendant on an annual basis. Special Agents currently comprise around 2,400 of the Agency&#x27;s approximately 5,000 personnel.

Industry Operations Investigators (IOIs) are the backbone of the ATF regulatory mission. Their work is primarily investigative and routinely involves contact with, and interviews of, individuals from all walks of life and all levels of industry and government. Investigations and inspections pertain to the industries and persons regulated by ATF (e.g., firearms and explosives users, dealers, importers, exporters, manufacturers, wholesalers, etc.); and are under the jurisdiction of the Gun Control Act, National Firearms Act, Arms Export Control Act, Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, and other Federal firearms and explosives laws and regulations.

The remainder of the bureau is personnel in various staff and support roles from office administrative assistants to intelligence analysts, forensic scientists, legal counsel, and technical specialists. Additionally, ATF relies heavily on state and local task force officers to supplement the Special Agents and who are not officially part of the ATF roster.

==Training==
Basic special agent training for new hires consists of a two-part training program. The first part is the Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia. The CITP provides fundamental training in the techniques, concepts, and methodologies of conducting criminal investigations. Some of the subjects covered in the training include training in firearms, physical techniques, driving techniques, handcuffing, interviewing, surveillance, crime scene management, photography, basic firearms training, and federal court procedures.
The CITP lasts approximately 12 weeks. Each class consists of 48 students, of whom approximately half are ATF trainees. The remaining portion of the CITP class consists of students from other federal agencies.

The second part of training is the Special Agent Basic Training (SABT), which is conducted at FLETC and covers a wide range of disciplines including firearms and ammunition identification; firearms trafficking; report writing, interviewing techniques; alcohol/tobacco diversion investigations; explosives and fire/arson investigations; firearms and tactical training, close quarter countermeasures; field operations, undercover techniques; and physical conditioning. The SABT consists of approximately 15 weeks of training with a class of 24 student trainees.

Industry Operations Investigator Basic Training (IOIBT) is a comprehensive 10-week program designed to train newly hired industry operations investigators (IOI) in the basic knowledge, skills, and abilities they need to effectively conduct inspections of firearms and explosives licensees and permittees, as well as provide assistance to other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies. Successful completion of IOIBT is mandatory in order for the newly hired IOI to maintain their employment.

==Special Response Teams==
ATF&#x27;s Special Response Teams (SRTs) are elite tactical groups that rapidly respond to high-risk law enforcement operations and conduct criminal investigations that lead to the arrests of the most violent criminals in the United States. Their work includes search and arrest warrants, high-risk criminal investigations, undercover operations, surveillance operations, and protective service operations.
Team members are specially trained ATF special agents who may serve full or part time. They often serve in various roles such as crisis negotiators, team leaders, tactical operators, snipers, operator medics and canine handlers.

==Firearms==
Members of ATF special agent ranks are issued the Glock 19M as their primary duty weapon and are trained in the use of, and issued, certain rifles and shotguns. The ATF Special Response Team (SRT) is armed with Colt M4 carbines and other firearms.

==Organization==
The ATF is organized as follows:
* Director
** Chief of Staff
** Chief Counsel
* Deputy Director (Chief Operating Officer)
** Office of Field Operations
** Office of Human Resources and Professional Development
** Office of Management
** Office of Enforcement Programs and Services
** Office of Professional Responsibility and Security Operations
** Office of Public and Governmental Affairs
** Office of Science and Technology
** Office of Strategic Intelligence and Information

===Field divisions===
The ATF has 26 field divisions across the nation in major cities. Those cities are: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Columbus (OH), Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Kansas City (MO), Los Angeles, Louisville, Miami, Nashville, New Orleans, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Francisco, Seattle, St. Paul, Tampa, and Washington, D.C. Also, there are field offices in different countries such as Canada, Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia, Iraq, Lithuania, and in the Caribbean.

==Regulation of firearms==

ATF is responsible for regulating firearm commerce in the United States. The bureau issues Federal Firearms Licenses (FFL) to sellers and conducts firearms licensee inspections. The bureau is also involved in programs aimed at reducing gun violence in the United States, by targeting and arresting violent offenders who unlawfully possess firearms. ATF was also involved with the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, which expanded tracing of firearms recovered by law enforcement and the ongoing Comprehensive Crime Gun Tracing Initiative. ATF also provides support to state and local investigators through the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) program.

In 2006, Congress made the ATF head subject to Senate confirmation and, until recently, only one nominee had not been blocked from heading the ATF in the Senate. Steven Dettelbach became the second in July 2022 after being nominated by President Joe Biden.

===Firearms tracing===
ATF&#x27;s Comprehensive Crime Gun Tracing Initiative is the largest operation of its kind in the world. In FY07, ATF&#x27;s National Tracing Center processed over 285,000 trace requests on guns for over 6,000 law enforcement agencies in 50 countries. ATF uses a Web-based system, known as eTrace, that provides law enforcement agencies with the capability to securely and electronically send trace requests, receive trace results, and conduct basic trace analysis in real time. Over 2,000 agencies and more than 17,000 individuals currently use eTrace, including over 33 foreign law enforcement agencies. Gun tracing provides information to federal, state, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies on the history of a firearm from the manufacturer (or importer), through the distribution chain, to the first retail purchaser. This information is used to link suspects to firearms in criminal investigations, identify potential traffickers, and detect in-state, interstate, and international patterns in the sources and types of crime guns. These results are then used to help the courts prosecute the offenders and attempt to clamp down on firearm crime.

===Firearms ballistic tracing===
ATF provides investigative support to its partners through the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN), which allows federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to image and compare crime gun evidence. NIBIN currently has 203 sites. In FY07, NIBIN&#x27;s 174 partner agencies imaged more than 183,000 bullets and casings into the database, resulting in over 5,200 matches that provided investigative leads.

==Regulation of explosives==
With the passage of the Organized Crime Control Act (OCCA) in 1970, ATF took over the regulation of explosives in the United States, as well as prosecution of persons engaged in criminal acts involving explosives. One of the most notable investigations successfully conducted by ATF agents was the tracing of the vehicle used in the World Trade Center 1993 bombings, which led to the arrest of persons involved in the conspiracy.

ATF also enforces provisions of the Safe Explosives Act, passed after 9/11 to restrict the use/possession of explosives without a federal license to use them. ATF is considered to be the leading federal agency in most bombings that occur within the U.S., with exception to bombings related to international terrorism (investigated by the FBI).

ATF currently trains the U.S. military in evidence recovery procedures after a bombing. All ATF Agents are trained in post-blast investigation; however ATF maintains a cadre of approximately 150 highly trained explosive experts known as Certified Explosives Specialists (CES). ATF/CES Agents are trained as experts regarding Improvised Explosive Devices (IED&#x27;s), as well as commercial explosives. ATF Agents work closely with state and local Bomb Disposal Units (bomb squads) within the United States.

==Directors==

&quot;Unnumbered rows denote acting directors.&quot;

Note: Davis was head of the predecessor, the ATF division of the IRS, and oversaw its transition to an independent bureau.

==Criticism==
Some media outlets have criticized the ATF, even going so far as to call for the abolition of the agency. One such criticism leveled by &quot;Reason&quot; magazine&#x27;s J.D. Tuccille stated, &quot;The nicest thing you can say about the ATF is that it&#x27;s an unserious and unaccountable bureaucracy. Often it&#x27;s explicitly contemptible, such as during the Fast-and-Furious gun-walking scandal, and its setting up mentally disabled youths to take the fall during gun-and-drug stings. After those abuses of individual rights and public trust, the failings of the National Disposal Branch almost pale by comparison ... the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives should be abolished, and its employees sent into the world to seek honest jobs in the private sector, if anybody will have them.&quot;

Tuccille&#x27;s primary reason for the complaint related to the mishandling of information and even security of firearms that led to the theft and sale of thousands of confiscated firearms by ATF personnel to private parties. Tuccille argued that if even a fraction of said activity had occurred at a gun store instead, the store would have promptly and swiftly been shut down by the ATF, but that the ATF is not held to the same standards that they hold FFL&#x27;s, &quot;You have to wonder what the ATF would say about a private facility that was ripped off for years on end by its own staffers and still failed to implement serious security measures after the fact. I expect that the consequences would be a bit more serious than a single arrest and then business as usual despite a tut-tutting reprimand.&quot;

The ATF has also received criticism involving financial corruption. In 2021, a whistleblower informed the public that the ATF was giving a 25% monetary bonus to at least 94 of its employees. The benefit is known as law enforcement availability pay, or LEAP, that was only reserved for &quot;criminal investigators&quot; who are on call and expected to work unscheduled, additional hours. It was noted by the whistleblower that administrative officials were receiving this benefit, despite not being classified as criminal investigators.

<text>Gift is a 1993 experimental docudrama made by Perry Farrell and his then-girlfriend, Casey Niccoli. The film prominently features Farrell&#x27;s band Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

== Production ==
Though released in 1993, the majority of filming took place three years earlier during the recording sessions of Ritual de lo Habitual in 1990.

The film was edited by Eric Zumbrunnen and Niccoli.

== Release ==
&quot;Gift&quot; premiered to a limited audience on February 19, 1993, more than 18 months after Jane&#x27;s Addiction officially dissolved, and was released to VHS by Warner Brothers on August 24, 1993. A laserdisc version was released in Japan, which features Japanese subtitles and obligatory censorship of visible genitalia. The film has achieved cult status among Jane&#x27;s Addiction fans.

== Music ==
The following Jane&#x27;s Addiction songs are featured in the soundtrack:
* &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Right&quot;
* &quot;Classic Girl&quot;
* &quot;Of Course&quot;
* &quot;Stop&quot;
* &quot;Three Days&quot;

Rapper Ice-T, Body Count, and Jane&#x27;s Addiction performed Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey&quot; in the film.

<doc id="345286" wikidata="Q854422" url="?curid=345286" title="Gel permeation chromatography">
<text>Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is a type of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), that separates high molecular weight or colloidal analytes on the basis of size or diameter, typically in organic solvents. The technique is often used for the analysis of polymers. As a technique, SEC was first developed in 1955 by Lathe and Ruthven. The term &quot;gel permeation chromatography&quot; can be traced back to J.C. Moore of the Dow Chemical Company who investigated the technique in 1964. The proprietary column technology was licensed to Waters Corporation, who subsequently commercialized this technology in 1964. GPC systems and consumables are now also available from a number of manufacturers. It is often necessary to separate polymers, both to analyze them as well as to purify the desired product.

When characterizing polymers, it is important to consider their size distribution and dispersity (&quot;Đ&quot;) as well their molecular weight. Polymers can be characterized by a variety of definitions for molecular weight including the number average molecular weight (Mn), the weight average molecular weight (Mw) (see molar mass distribution), the size average molecular weight (Mz), or the viscosity molecular weight (Mv). GPC allows for the determination of &quot;Đ&quot; as well as Mv and, based on other data, the Mn, Mw, and Mz can be determined.

==How it works==

GPC is a type of chromatography in which analytes are separated, based on their size or hydrodynamic volume (radius of gyration). This differs from other chromatographic techniques, which depend upon chemical or physical interactions between the mobile and stationary phases to separate analytes. Separation occurs via the use of porous gel beads packed inside a column (see stationary phase (chemistry)). The principle of separation relies on the differential exclusion or inclusion of the macromolecules by the porous gel stationary phase. Larger molecules are excluded from entering the pores and elute earlier, while smaller molecules can enter the pores, thus staying longer inside the column. The entire process takes place without any interaction of the analytes with the surface of the stationary phase. The smaller analytes relative to the pore sizes can permeate these pores and spend more time inside the gel particles, increasing their retention time. Conversely, larger analytes relative to the pores sizes spend little if any time inside the column, hence they elute sooner. Each type of column has a range of molecular weights that can be separated, according to their pores sizes. If an analyte is too large relative to the column&#x27;s pores, it will not be retained at all and will be totally excluded; conversely, if the analyte is small relative to the pores sizes, it will be totally permeating. Analytes that are totally excluded, elute with the free volume outside around the particles (Vo), the total exclusion limit, while analytes that are completely delayed, elute with the solvent, marking the total permeation volume of the column, including also the solvent held inside the pores (Vi). The total volume can be considered by the following equation, where Vg is the volume of the polymer gel and Vt is the total volume: formula_1
As can be inferred, there is a limited range of molecular weights that can be separated by each column, therefore the size of the pores for the packing should be chosen according to the range of molecular weight of analytes to be separated. For polymer separations the pore sizes should be on the order of the polymers being analyzed. If a sample has a broad molecular weight range it may be necessary to use several GPC columns with varying pores volumes in tandem to resolve the sample fully.

==Application==

GPC is often used to determine the relative molecular weight of polymer samples as well as the distribution of molecular weights. What GPC truly measures is the molecular volume and shape function as defined by the intrinsic viscosity. If comparable standards are used, this relative data can be used to determine molecular weights within ± 5% accuracy. Polystyrene standards with dispersities of less than 1.2 are typically used to calibrate the GPC. Unfortunately, polystyrene tends to be a very linear polymer and therefore as a standard it is only useful to compare it to other polymers that are known to be linear and of relatively the same size.

==Material and methods==

===Instrumentation===
 

Gel permeation chromatography is conducted almost exclusively in chromatography systems. The experimental design is not much different from other techniques of High Performance liquid chromatography. Samples are dissolved in an appropriate solvent, in the case of GPC these tend to be organic solvents and after filtering the solution it is injected onto a column. The separation of multi-component mixture takes place in the column. The constant supply of fresh eluent to the column is accomplished by the use of a pump. Since most analytes are not visible to the naked eye a detector is needed. Often multiple detectors are used to gain additional information about the polymer sample. The availability of a detector makes the fractionation convenient and accurate.

===Gel===
Gels are used as stationary phase for GPC. The pore size of a gel must be carefully controlled in order to be able to apply the gel to a given separation. Other desirable properties of the gel forming agent are the absence of ionizing groups and, in a given solvent, low affinity for the substances to be separated. Commercial gels like PLgel &amp; Styragel (cross-linked polystyrene-divinylbenzene), LH-20 (hydroxypropylated Sephadex), Bio-Gel (cross-linked polyacrylamide), HW-20 &amp; HW-40 (hydroxylated methacrylic polymer), and agarose gel are often used based on different separation requirements.

=== Column ===
The column used for GPC is filled with a microporous packing material. The column is filled with the gel. Since the total penetration volume is the maximum volume permeated by the analytes, and there is no retention on the surface of the stationary phase, the total column volume is usually large, relatively to the sample volume.

===Eluent===
The eluent (mobile phase) should be the appropriate solvent to dissolve the polymer, should not interfere with the response of the polymer analyzed, and should wet the packing surface and make it inert to interactions with the polymers. The most common eluents for polymers that dissolve at room temperature GPC are tetrahydrofuran (THF), &quot;o&quot;-dichlorobenzene and trichlorobenzene at 130–150 °C for crystalline polyalkynes and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) for crystalline condensation polymers such as polyamides and polyesters.

===Pump===
There are two types of pumps available for uniform delivery of relatively small liquid volumes for GPC: piston or peristaltic pumps. The delivery of a constant flow free of fluctuations is especially important to the precision of the GPC analysis, as the flow-rate is used for the calibration of the molecular weight, or diameter.

===Detector===
In GPC, the concentration by weight of polymer in the eluting solvent may be monitored continuously with a detector. There are many detector types available and they can be divided into two main categories. The first is concentration sensitive detectors which includes UV-VIS absorption, differential refractometer (DRI) or refractive index (RI) detectors, infrared (IR) absorption and density detectors. The second category is molecular weight sensitive detectors, which include low angle light scattering detectors (LALLS) and multi angle light scattering (MALS). The resulting chromatogram is therefore a weight distribution of the polymer as a function of retention volume. The most sensitive detector is the differential UV photometer and the most common detector is the differential refractometer (DRI). When characterizing copolymer, it is necessary to have two detectors in series. For accurate determinations of copolymer composition at least two of those detectors should be concentration detectors. The determination of most copolymer compositions is done using UV and RI detectors, although other combinations can be used.

==Data analysis==

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) has become the most widely used technique for analyzing polymer samples in order to determine their molecular weights and weight distributions. Examples of GPC chromatograms of polystyrene samples with their molecular weights and dispersities are shown on the left.

 Benoit and co-workers proposed that the hydrodynamic volume, Vη, which is proportional to the product of [η] and M, where [η] is the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer in the SEC eluent, may be used as the universal calibration parameter. If the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada constants K and α are known (see Mark–Houwink equation), a plot of log [η]M versus elution volume (or elution time) for a particular solvent, column and instrument provides a universal calibration curve which can be used for any polymer in that solvent. By determining the retention volumes (or times) of monodisperse polymer standards (e.g. solutions of monodispersed polystyrene in THF), a calibration curve can be obtained by plotting the logarithm of the molecular weight versus the retention time or volume. Once the calibration curve is obtained, the gel permeation chromatogram of any other polymer can be obtained in the same solvent and the molecular weights (usually Mn and Mw) and the complete molecular weight distribution for the polymer can be determined. A typical calibration curve is shown to the right and the molecular weight from an unknown sample can be obtained from the calibration curve.

==Advantages==
As a separation technique, GPC has many advantages. First of all, it has a well-defined separation time due to the fact that there is a final elution volume for all unretained analytes. Additionally, GPC can provide narrow bands, although this aspect of GPC is more difficult for polymer samples that have broad ranges of molecular weights present. Finally, since the analytes do not interact chemically or physically with the column, there is a lower chance for analyte loss to occur. For investigating the properties of polymer samples in particular, GPC can be very advantageous. GPC provides a more convenient method of determining the molecular weights of polymers. In fact most samples can be thoroughly analyzed in an hour or less. Other methods used in the past were fractional extraction and fractional precipitation. As these processes were quite labor-intensive molecular weights and mass distributions typically were not analyzed. Therefore, GPC has allowed for the quick and relatively easy estimation of molecular weights and distribution for polymer samples

==Disadvantages==

There are disadvantages to GPC, however. First, there is a limited number of peaks that can be resolved within the short time scale of the GPC run. Also, as a technique GPC requires around at least a 10% difference in molecular weight for a reasonable resolution of peaks to occur. In regards to polymers, the molecular masses of most of the chains will be too close for the GPC separation to show anything more than broad peaks. Another disadvantage of GPC for polymers is that filtrations must be performed before using the instrument to prevent dust and other particulates from ruining the columns and interfering with the detectors. Although useful for protecting the instrument, there is the possibility of the pre-filtration of the sample removing higher molecular weight sample before it can be loaded on the column. Another possibility to overcome these issues is the separation by field-flow fractionation (FFF).

==Orthogonal methods==

Field-flow fractionation (FFF) can be considered as an alternative to GPC, especially when particles or high molar mass polymers cause clogging of the column, shear degradation is an issue or agglomeration takes place but cannot be made visible. FFF is separation in an open flow channel without having a static phase involved so no interactions occur. With one field-flow fractionation version, thermal field-flow fractionation, separation of polymers having the same size but different chemical compositions is possible.

<doc id="345295" wikidata="Q785357" url="?curid=345295" title="Virginia Military Institute">
<text>The Virginia Military Institute (VMI) is a public senior military college in Lexington, Virginia, United States. It was founded in 1839 as America&#x27;s first state military college and is the oldest public senior military college in the U.S. In keeping with its founding principles and unlike any other senior military college in the U.S., VMI enrolls cadets only and awards bachelor&#x27;s degrees exclusively. The institute grants degrees in 14 disciplines in engineering, science, and the liberal arts.

While Abraham Lincoln first called VMI &quot;The West Point of the South&quot; because of its role during the American Civil War, the nickname has remained because VMI has produced more Army generals than any ROTC program in the U.S. Despite the nickname, VMI differs from the federal military service academies in many regards. For example, as of 2019 VMI had a total enrollment of 1,722 cadets (as compared to 4,500 at the Academies) making it one of the smallest NCAA Division I schools in the United States. All VMI cadets must participate in the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) of the United States Armed Forces programs, but are afforded the flexibility of pursuing civilian endeavors or accepting an officer&#x27;s commission in the active or reserve components of one of the six U.S. military branches upon graduation. Approximately 65% of VMI graduates enter the military upon graduation, making it one of the largest producers of officers for the United States Army and Marine Corps each year.

==Governance==
The Board of Visitors is the supervisory board of the Virginia Military Institute. Although the Governor is &quot;ex officio&quot; the commander-in-chief of the institute, and no one may be declared a graduate without his signature, he delegates to the board the responsibility for developing the institute&#x27;s policy. The board appoints the superintendent and approves appointment of members of the faculty and staff on the recommendation of the superintendent. The board may make bylaws and regulations for their own government and the management of the affairs of the institute, and while the institute is exempt from the Administrative Process Act in accordance with Va. Code (which exempts educational institutions operated by the Commonwealth), some of its regulations are codified at 8VAC 100. The Executive Committee conducts the business of the board during recesses.

The board has 17 members, including &quot;ex officio&quot; the adjutant general of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Regular members are appointed by the governor for a four-year term and may be reappointed once. Of the sixteen appointed members, twelve must be alumni of the institute, eight of whom must be residents of Virginia and four must be non-residents; and the remaining four members must be non-alumni Virginia residents. The Executive Committee consists of the board&#x27;s president, three vice presidents, and one non-alumnus at large, and is appointed by the board at each annual meeting.

Under the militia bill (the Virginia Code of 1860) officers of the institute were recognized as part of the military establishment of the state, and the governor had authority to issue commissions to them in accordance with institute regulations. Current law makes provision for officers of the Virginia Militia to be subject to orders of the governor. The cadets are a military corps (the Corps of Cadets) under the command of the superintendent and under the administration of the Commandant of Cadets, and constitute the guard of the institute.

==History==
===Early history===

In the years after the War of 1812, the Commonwealth of Virginia built and maintained several arsenals to store weapons intended for use by the state militia in the event of invasion or slave revolt. One of them was placed in Lexington. Residents came to resent the presence of the soldiers, whom they saw as drunken and undisciplined. In 1826, one guard beat another to death. Townspeople wanted to keep the arsenal, but sought a new way of guarding it, so as to eliminate the &quot;undesirable element.&quot;

In 1834, the Franklin Society, a local literary and debate society, debated, &quot;Would it be politic for the State to establish a military school, at the Arsenal, near Lexington, in connection with Washington College, on the plan of the West Point Academy?&quot; They unanimously concluded that it would. Lexington attorney John Thomas Lewis Preston became the most active advocate of the proposal. In a series of three anonymous letters in the &quot;Lexington Gazette&quot; in 1835, he proposed replacing the arsenal guard with students living under military discipline, receiving some military education, as well as a liberal education. The school&#x27;s graduates would contribute to the development of the state and, should the need arise, provide trained officers for the state&#x27;s militia.

After a public relations campaign that included Preston meeting in person with influential business, military and political figures and many open letters from prominent supporters, in 1836 the Virginia legislature passed a bill authorizing creation of a school at the Lexington arsenal, and the Governor signed the measure into law.

The organizers of the planned school formed a board of visitors, which included Preston, and the board selected Claudius Crozet as their first president. Crozet had served as an engineer in Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s army before immigrating to the United States. In America, he served as an engineering professor at West Point, as well as state engineer in Louisiana and mathematics professor at Jefferson College in Convent, Louisiana. Crozet was also the Chief Engineer of Virginia and someone whom Thomas Jefferson referred to as, &quot;the smartest mathematician in the United States.&quot; The board delegated to Preston the task of deciding what to call the new school, and he created the name Virginia Military Institute.

Under Crozet&#x27;s direction, the board of visitors crafted VMI&#x27;s program of instruction, basing it off of those of the United States Military Academy and Crozet&#x27;s alma mater the École Polytechnique of Paris. So, instead of the mix of military and liberal education imagined by Preston, the board created a military and engineering school offering the most thorough engineering curriculum in America, outside of West Point.

Preston was also tasked with hiring VMI&#x27;s first superintendent. He was persuaded that West Point graduate and former army officer Francis Henney Smith, then professor of mathematics at Hampden–Sydney College, was the most suitable candidate. Preston successfully recruited Smith, and convinced him to become the first superintendent and Professor of Tactics.

After Smith agreed to accept the superintendent&#x27;s position, Preston applied to join the faculty, and was hired as Professor of Languages. Classes began in 1839, and the first cadet to march a sentinel post was Private John Strange. With few exceptions, there have been sentinels posted at VMI every hour of every day of the school year since November 11, 1839.

The Class of 1842 graduated 16 cadets. Living conditions were poor until 1850 when the cornerstone of the new barracks was laid. In 1851 Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson became a member of the faculty and professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy. Under Major Jackson and Major William Gilham, VMI infantry and artillery units were present at the hanging of John Brown at Charles Town, Virginia (now West Virginia) in 1859.

=== Founding of the VMI Museum ===
In a letter dated February 27, 1845, addressed to William S. Beale, VMI Class of 1843, Superintendent Smith solicited items to create an Institute museum to inspire and educate cadets. Superintendent Smith accepted a donation of a Revolutionary War musket in 1856, thus establishing the first public museum in the Commonwealth of Virginia. For the first 75 years the museum was a &quot;special collection&quot; administered by the VMI library, a common model still in use by many colleges and universities.

In the early 20th century, the collection was organized as a public resource and took the form of a modern museum. In 1970, the museum was recognized as its own department, and was professionally accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Today the VMI Museum System consists of the VMI Museum on the VMI Post, the Virginia Museum of the Civil War located at the 300-acre New Market Battlefield State Historical Park; and the Jackson House, interpreting the life of VMI Professor Thomas J. (later &quot;Stonewall&quot;) Jackson and his household on the eve of Civil War.

===Civil War period===
VMI cadets and alumni played instrumental roles in the American Civil War. On 14 occasions, the Confederacy called cadets into active military engagements. VMI authorized battle streamers for each one of these engagements but chose to carry only one: the battle streamer for New Market. Many VMI Cadets were ordered to Camp Lee, at Richmond, to train recruits under Stonewall Jackson.

During the war, approximately 1,800 VMI alumni served the South (including 19 in the U.S. Army), with about 250 of them killed in action. VMI alumni were regarded among the best officers, and several distinguished themselves in the Union forces as well. Fifteen graduates rose to the rank of general in the Confederate Army, and one rose to this rank in the Union Army. Just before his famous flank attack at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Jackson looked at his division and brigade commanders, noted the high number of VMI graduates and said, &quot;The Institute will be heard from today.&quot; Two of Jackson&#x27;s four division commanders at Chancellorsville, Generals Robert Rodes and Raleigh Colston, were VMI graduates as were more than twenty of his brigadiers and colonels.

====Battle of New Market====

On May 14, 1864, the governor of Virginia called upon the cadets from VMI to service. After marching overnight 80 miles (129 km) from Lexington to New Market, on May 15, 1864, 247 cadets then fought at the Battle of New Market, marking the only time in U.S. history wherein the student body of an operating college fought as an organized unit in pitched combat in battle (as recognized by the American Battlefield Trust).

General John C. Breckinridge, the commanding Southern general, had held the cadets in reserve and did not use them until Union troops broke through the Confederate lines. Upon seeing the tide of battle turning in favor of the Union forces, Breckinridge stated, &quot;Put the boys in...and may God forgive me for the order.&quot; The VMI cadets held the line and eventually pushed forward across an open muddy field, capturing a Union artillery emplacement, and helping to secure victory for the Confederates. In a matter of minutes, VMI suffered fifty-five casualties with another five cadets killed in action; the cadets were led into battle by the Commandant of Cadets and future VMI Superintendent Colonel Scott Shipp. Shipp was also wounded during the battle.

The VMI battalion (of infantry and artillery) received an institutional battle streamer for its part in the battle of New Market, one of only five American institutions to be awarded such an honor.

===== List of cadet deaths =====
Five cadets were killed in action on May 15:

In addition, five of those wounded in the battle later died of their wounds:

Another cadet, William D. Buster, died of typhoid while on service in Richmond in April 1865.

====Burning of the Institute====
On June 12, 1864, a month after New Market, Union forces, under the command of General David Hunter, shelled and burned the Institute as part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864. The museum was also destroyed (but was later reopened in 1870). The destruction of the buildings was almost complete, and VMI had to temporarily hold classes at the Alms House in Richmond, Virginia. One of the reasons that Confederate General Jubal A. Early burned the town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, was in retaliation for the destruction of VMI. 

=== Post Civil War ===
In April 1865, Richmond was evacuated due to the impending fall of Petersburg and the VMI Corps of Cadets was disbanded. The Lexington campus reopened for classes on October 17, 1865 with Francis H. Smith returning as superintendent. VMI went on to become a model for other institutions in the South, including Louisiana State University and Texas A&amp;M.

After the war, Matthew Fontaine Maury, the pioneering oceanographer known as the &quot;Pathfinder of the Seas&quot;, accepted a teaching position at VMI, holding the physics chair. John Mercer Brooke also joined the school. Similarly, David Hunter Strother, who was chief of staff to General Hunter and had advised the destruction of the institute, served as Adjutant General of the Virginia Militia and member of the VMI Board of Visitors; in that position he promoted and worked actively for the reconstruction. Scott Shipp, who led cadets at New Market, became the school&#x27;s second superintendent in 1890. 

In 1903, a statue sculpted by Moses Ezekiel, a VMI cadet who had fought and was wounded at New Market, called &quot;Virginia Mourning Her Dead&quot;, was dedicated. Six of the ten fallen cadets are now buried on VMI grounds behind the statue. In 1912, another statue by Ezekiel, a relica statue of General Jackson, was also donated to the VMI. 

=== World War II ===

VMI produced many of America&#x27;s commanders in World War II. The most important of these was George C. Marshall (class of 1901), the top U.S. Army general during the war. Marshall was the Army&#x27;s first five-star general and the only career military officer ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Winston Churchill dubbed Marshall the &quot;Architect of Victory&quot; and &quot;the noblest Roman of them all&quot;. The Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army during the war was also a VMI graduate as were the Second U.S. Army commander, 15th U.S. Army commander, the commander of Allied Air Forces of the Southwest Pacific and various corps and division commanders in the Army and Marine Corps. China&#x27;s General Sun Li-jen, known as the &quot;Rommel of the East&quot;, was also a graduate of VMI.

During the war, VMI participated in the War Department&#x27;s Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) from 1943 to 1946. The program provided training in engineering and related subjects to enlisted men at colleges across the United States. Over 2,100 ASTP members studied at VMI during the war.

===Post-World War II===
The arsenal, the structure that received most of the damage when Union forces shelled and burned the institute in June 1864, was rebuilt as the Old Barracks. The new wing of the barracks (&quot;New Barracks&quot;) was completed in 1949.

In 1997, 30 female students enrolled, marking VMI&#x27;s new status as a coeducational institution.

In October 2020, VMI Board of Visitors announced that they would relocate the Jackson statue from the front of the historic barracks to the New Market Battlefield State Historical Park. It was taken from view in December 2020.

==== Racism investigation ====
Virginia Military Institute was the last public college in Virginia to integrate, first admitting black cadets in 1968, but interracial problems persisted long afterward. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, even in 2020 &quot;Black cadets still endure[d] relentless racism [in an] atmosphere of hostility and cultural insensitivity&quot;.

On October 19, 2020, following the exposé, Governor Ralph Northam and multiple other state officials wrote the VMI Board of Visitors that they had &quot;deep concerns about the clear and appalling culture of ongoing structural racism&quot; at VMI. They reported that they had received reports from students of a racist culture at VMI. The students reported a threat of lynching, attacks on social media, and a staff member promoting &quot;an inaccurate and dangerous &#x27;Lost Cause&#x27; version of Virginia&#x27;s history.&quot; The letter was signed by Northam, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, State Senate President Louise Lucas, Attorney General Mark Herring, and Chairman of the Black Caucus Lamont Bagby. Northam, a 1981 VMI alumnus, ordered a state-led investigation. Six days later, on October 26, 2020, Superintendent Peay tendered his resignation, saying in his resignation letter that he&#x27;d been told that Northam and other state legislators had &quot;lost confidence in my leadership&quot; and &quot;desired my resignation&quot;. Three days later, the VMI Board of Visitors voted unanimously to remove the Jackson statue and create a building and naming committee. The school reaffirmed the statue&#x27;s removal in December and began plans to relocated it to a Civil War museum located on a battlefield where a number of VMI cadets and alumni were killed or wounded.

In October, the board also announced several diversity-related decisions: a diversity officer would be appointed, a diversity and inclusion committee would be created, and diversity initiatives created to include a focus on gender and the adoption of a diversity hiring plan. Nine months later, a report into racial intolerance charged by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia was delivered. The independent report concluded that VMI &quot;maintained and allowed a racist and sexist culture that, until recently, it had no appetite to address.&quot; The authors, employed by the law firm Barnes &amp; Thornburg, also accused the institution&#x27;s leadership, including its governing board, with an &quot;unwillingness to change or even question its practices.&quot;

==Campus==

The VMI campus covers , 12 of which are designated as the Virginia Military Institute Historic District, a designated National Historic Landmark District. The campus is referred to as the &quot;Post,&quot; a tradition that reflects the school&#x27;s military focus and the uniformed service of its alumni. A training area of several hundred additional acres is located near the post. All cadets are housed on campus in a large five-story building, called the &quot;barracks.&quot; The Old Barracks, which has been separately designated a National Historic Landmark, stands on the site of the old arsenal.

The two wings surround two quadrangles connected by a sally port. All rooms open onto porch-like stoops facing one of the quadrangles. A third barracks wing was completed, with cadets moving in officially spring semester 2009. Four of the five arched entries into the barracks are named for George Washington, Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, George C. Marshall &#x27;01 and Jonathan Daniels &#x27;61.

VMI&#x27;s &quot;Vision 2039&quot; capital campaign raised more than $275 million from alumni and supporters in three years. The money is going to expand The Barracks to house 1,500 cadets, renovate and modernize the academic buildings. VMI is spending another $200 million to build the VMI Center for Leadership and Ethics, to be used by cadets, Washington and Lee University students, and other U.S. and international students. The funding will also support &quot;study abroad&quot; programs, including joint ventures with Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England and many other universities.

==Academics==
VMI offers 14 major and 23 minor areas of study, grouped into engineering, liberal arts, humanities, and the sciences. The engineering department has concentrations in three areas: civil and environmental engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. Most classes are taught by full-time professors, 99 percent of whom hold terminal degrees.

Within four months of graduation, an average of 97 percent of VMI graduates are either serving in the military, employed, or admitted to graduate or professional schools.

As of 2010, VMI had graduated 11 Rhodes Scholars since 1921. Per capita, as of 2006 VMI had graduated more Rhodes Scholars than any other state-supported college or university, and more than all the other senior military colleges combined.

===Rankings===
In 2021 VMI ranked fourth nationally, after the United States Military Academy, the United States Naval Academy and the United States Air Force Academy, in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings&#x27; &quot;Top Public Schools, National Liberal Arts Colleges&quot; category.

Forbes&#x27; 2012 Special Report on America&#x27;s Best Colleges ranked VMI in the top 25 public universities in the nation, well ahead of any other senior military college in the country. VMI was ranked 14th in the &quot;Top 25 Publics&quot; section, just behind the United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, and the United States Naval Academy, but ahead of the United States Coast Guard Academy and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. Overall, VMI ranked 115th out of the 650 colleges and universities evaluated.

Kiplinger&#x27;s magazine, in its ranking of the &quot;Best Values in Public Colleges&quot; for 2006, made mention of the Virginia Military Institute as a &quot;great value&quot;, although the military nature of its program excluded it from consideration as a traditional four-year college in the rankings.

==Military service==

While all cadets are required to take four years of ROTC, accepting a commission in the armed forces is optional. While over 50 percent of VMI graduates are commissioned each year, the VMI Board of Visitors has set a goal of having 70 percent of VMI cadets take a commission. The VMI class of 2017 graduated 300 cadets, 172 (or 57 percent) of whom were commissioned as officers in the United States military.

VMI alumni include more than 285 general and flag officers, including the first five-star General of the Army, George Marshall; seven recipients of the highest U.S. military decoration, the Medal of Honor; and more than 80 recipients of the second-highest awards, the Distinguished Service Cross and Navy Cross. VMI offers ROTC programs for five U.S. military branches (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard).

VMI has graduated more generals than any ROTC program in the United States. The following table lists U.S. four-star generals who graduated from VMI. It does not list alumni who did not graduate from the school, such as General George S. Patton and General Sam S. Walker, and the many VMI graduates who served or still serve as four-star generals in foreign nations such as Thailand, China, and Taiwan.
==Students==
Prospective cadets must be between 16 and 22 years of age. They must be unmarried, and have no legal dependents, be physically fit for enrollment in the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), and be graduates of an accredited secondary school or have completed an approved homeschool curriculum. The Class of 2022 at VMI had an average high school GPA of 3.70 and a mean SAT score of 1210.

Eligibility is not restricted to Virginia residents, although it is more difficult to gain an appointment as a non-resident, because VMI has a goal that no more than 45 percent of cadets come from outside Virginia. Virginia residents receive a discount in tuition, as is common at most state-sponsored schools. Total tuition, room and board, and other fees for the 2008–2009 school year was approximately $17,000 for Virginia residents and $34,000 for all others.

===Admission of women===

In 1990 the U.S. Department of Justice filed a discrimination lawsuit against VMI for its all-male admissions policy. While the court challenge was pending, a state-sponsored Virginia Women&#x27;s Institute for Leadership (VWIL) was opened at Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, Virginia, as a parallel program for women. The VWIL continued, even after VMI&#x27;s admission of women.

After VMI won its case in U.S. District Court, the case went through several appeals until June 26, 1996, when the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 7–1 decision in &quot;United States v. Virginia&quot;, found that it was unconstitutional for a school supported by public funds to exclude women. (Justice Clarence Thomas recused himself, presumably because his son was attending VMI at the time.) Following the ruling, VMI contemplated going private to exempt itself from the 14th Amendment, and thus avoid the ruling.

Assistant Secretary of Defense Frederick Pang, however, warned the school that the Department of Defense would withdraw ROTC programs from the school if privatization took place. As a result of this action by Pang, Congress passed a resolution on November 18, 1997, prohibiting the Department of Defense from withdrawing or diminishing any ROTC program at one of the six senior military colleges, including VMI. This escape clause provided by Congress came after the VMI Board of Visitors had already voted 9–8 to admit women; the decision was not revisited.

In 1996, VMI was forced to either end its prohibition of the admission of women, or become a private college without federal funding. VMI reluctantly became the last U.S. military college to admit women. Superintendent at the time Josiah Bunting III called this a &quot;savage disappointment&quot;.

In August 1997, VMI enrolled its first female cadets. The first co-ed class consisted of thirty women, who matriculated as part of the class of 2001. In order to accelerate VMI&#x27;s matriculation process, several women were allowed to transfer directly from various junior colleges, such as New Mexico Military Institute (NMMI), and forgo the traditional four-year curriculum required of most. The first female cadets &quot;walked the stage&quot; in 1999 for graduation, although by VMI&#x27;s definitions they are considered to be members of the class of 2001. Initially, these 30 women were held to the same strict physical courses and technical training as the male cadets, and even were required to shave their heads. In a July 2021 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article, it was alleged that derision, misogyny, sexual assault were continuous issues at VMI. 

===Admission of minority students===
The first Jewish cadet, Moses Jacob Ezekiel, graduated in 1866. While at VMI, Ezekiel fought with the VMI cadets at the Battle of New Market. He became a sculptor and his works are on display at VMI. One of the first Asian cadets was Sun Li-jen, the Chinese National Revolutionary Army general, who graduated in 1927. The first African-American cadets were admitted in 1968. The first African-American regimental commander was Darren McDew, class of 1982. McDew is a retired U.S. Air Force General and former Commander, United States Transportation Command, Scott Air Force Base, IL. It is unknown when the first Muslim cadet graduated from VMI, but before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, several Persian cadets attended and graduated from VMI. Other Muslim graduates have included cadets from Bangladesh, Jordan, Indonesia, Somalia and other nations. In 1982, Son (Sean) Minh Le became the first post-1975 Vietnamese refugee to graduate.

===Student life===
Just as cadets did nearly 200 years ago, today&#x27;s cadets give up such comforts as beds, instead lying upon cots colloquially referred to as &quot;hays&quot;. These hays are little more than foam mats that must be rolled every morning and aired every Monday. Further, cadet uniforms have changed little; the coatee worn in parades dates to the War of 1812. New cadets, known as &quot;Rats&quot;, are not permitted to watch TV or listen to music outside of an academic setting. Living conditions are considered more austere here than other senior military colleges.

===Ratline===
During the first six months at VMI, new cadets are called &quot;Rats&quot;, a term used since the 1850s. &quot;Rats&quot; refer to their classmates, male or female, as &quot;Brother Rats&quot;. VMI folklore has it that when Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) students and VMI cadets drilled together in the 1830s, the students called the cadets &quot;Rats&quot; perhaps because of their gray uniforms. The cadets responded in kind calling the neighboring students &quot;Minks&quot; perhaps because many of them were from wealthy backgrounds.

New cadets, known collectively as the &quot;Rat Mass,&quot; walk along a prescribed line in barracks while maintaining an exaggerated form of attention, called &quot;straining&quot;. This experience, called the Rat Line, is intended by the upper classes to instill camaraderie, pride, and discipline into the incoming class. Under this system, the Rats face numerous mental and physical challenges, starting with &quot;Hell Week&quot;. During Hell Week, Rats receive basic military instruction from select upper classmen (&quot;Cadre&quot;); they learn to march, to clean their M14 rifle, and to wear their uniforms. During Hell Week, Rats also meet the members of various cadet-run organizations and learn the functions of each.

At the end of the first week, each Rat is paired with a first classman (senior) who serves as their mentor for the rest of the first year. The first classman is called a &quot;Dyke&quot;, referencing an older Southern pronunciation of &quot;to deck out&quot;, or to get into a uniform, as one of the roles of the rat is to help prepare their &quot;Dyke&#x27;s&quot; uniform and dress them for parades.

The Ratline experience culminates with Resurrection Week ending in &quot;Breakout&quot;, an event where the Rats are formally &quot;welcomed&quot; to the VMI community. After the successful completion of Breakout, Rats are officially fourth class students and no longer have to strain in the barracks or eat &quot;square meals&quot;. Many versions of the Breakout ceremony have been conducted. In the 1950s, Rats from each company would be packed into a corner room in the barracks and brawl their way out through the upperclassmen. From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, the Rats had to fight their way up to the fourth level of the barracks through three other classes of cadets determined not to let them get to the top. The stoops would often be slick with motor oil, packed with snow, glazed with ice, greased, or continuously hosed with water. The barracks stairs and rails were not able to take the abuse, so the Corps moved the breakout to a muddy hill, where Rats attempt to climb to the top by crawling on their stomachs while the upper classes block them or drag them back down. The Rats no longer breakout in the mud but instead participate in a grueling day of physical activity testing both physical endurance and teamwork.

The entire body of Rats during the Ratline is called a &quot;Rat Mass&quot;. Since Rats are not officially fourth classmen until after Breakout, the Rat Mass is also not officially considered a graduating class until that time either. Prior to Breakout, the Rat mass is given a different style of year identifier to emphasize this difference. The year identifier starts with the year of the current graduating class (their dykes&#x27; class), followed by a &quot;+3&quot; to indicate the anticipated year of their own class. For example, cadets that make up the Class of 2022 were considered the &quot;Rat Mass of 2019+3&quot; as the members of their dykes&#x27; class graduated in 2019 and they themselves will graduate three years onward from then.
===Traditions===
In addition to the Ratline, VMI has other traditions that are emblematic of the school and its history including the new cadet oath ceremony, the pageantry of close-order marching, and the nightly playing of &quot;Taps&quot;. An event second only to graduation in importance is the &quot;Ring Figure&quot; dance held every November. During their junior year, cadets receive class rings at a ring presentation ceremony followed by a formal dance. Most cadets get two rings, a formal ring and a combat ring; some choose to have the combat ring for everyday wear, and the formal for special occasions.

Every year, VMI honors its fallen cadets with a New Market Day parade and ceremony. These events take place on May 15, the same day as the Battle of New Market in which VMI cadets fought in 1864 during the Civil War. During this ceremony, the roll is called for cadets who &quot;died on the Field of Honor&quot; and wreaths are placed on the graves of those who died during the Battle of New Market. Since 2021, this ceremony has expanded to also include VMI graduates who have died in service to the United States.

The requirement that all cadets wishing to eat dinner in the mess hall must be present for a prayer was the basis for a lawsuit in 2002 when two cadets sued VMI over the prayer said before dinner. The non-denominational prayer had been a daily fixture since the 1950s. In 2002 the Fourth Circuit ruled the prayer, during an event with mandatory attendance, at a state-funded school, violated the U.S. Constitution. When the Supreme Court declined to review the school&#x27;s appeal in April 2004, the prayer tradition was stopped.

The tradition of guarding the institute is one of the longest standing and is carried out to this day. Cadets have been posted as sentinels guarding the barracks 24 hours a day, seven days a week while school is in session since the first cadet sentinel, Cadet John B. Strange, and others relieved the Virginia Militia guard team tasked with defending the Lexington Arsenal (that later became VMI) in 1839. The guard team wears the traditional school uniform and each sentinel is armed with an M14 rifle and bayonet.

===Honor code===
VMI is known for its strict honor code, which is as old as the institute and was formally codified in the early 20th century. Under the VMI Honor Code, &quot;a cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do.&quot; There is only one punishment for violating the VMI Honor Code: immediate expulsion in the form of a drumming out ceremony of dismissal, in which the entire corps is awakened by drums in barracks and the honor court to hear the formal announcement. VMI is the only military college or academy in the Nation which maintains a single-sanction Honor Code and in recent times, the dismissed cadet is removed from post before the formal announcement is made.

===Clubs and activities===
VMI currently offers over 50 school-sponsored clubs and organizations, including The Cadet, recreational activities, military organizations, musical and performance groups, religious organizations and service groups. Although VMI prohibited cadet membership in fraternal organizations starting in 1885, VMI cadets were instrumental in starting several fraternities. Alpha Tau Omega fraternity was founded by VMI cadets Otis Allan Glazebrook, Alfred Marshall, and Erskine Mayo Ross at Richmond, Virginia on September 11, 1865, while the school was closed for reconstruction.

After the re-opening, Kappa Sigma Kappa fraternity was founded by cadets on September 28, 1867, and Sigma Nu fraternity was founded by cadets on January 1, 1869. VMI cadets formed the second chapter of the Kappa Alpha Order. In a special arrangement, graduating cadets may be nominated by Kappa Alpha Order alumni and inducted into the fraternity, becoming part of Kappa Alpha Order&#x27;s Beta Commission (a commission as opposed to an active chapter). This occurs following graduation, and the newly initiated VMI alumni are accepted as brothers of the fraternity.

==Athletics==
VMI fields 14 teams on the NCAA Division I level (FCS, formerly I-AA, for football). Varsity sports include baseball, basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, football, lacrosse, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rifle, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track &amp; field, and wrestling. VMI is a member of the Southern Conference (SoCon) for almost all sports, the MAAC for women&#x27;s water polo, and the America East Conference for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving. VMI formerly was a member of the Mid-Atlantic Rifle Conference for rifle, but began the 2016–2017 season as part of the Southern Conference. The VMI team name is the Keydets, a Southern style slang for the word &quot;cadets&quot;.

VMI has the second-smallest NCAA Division I enrollment of any FCS football college, after Presbyterian College. Approximately one-third of the Corps of Cadets plays on at least one of VMI&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams, making it one of the most active athletic programs in the country. Of the VMI varsity athletes who complete their eligibility, 92 percent receive their VMI degrees.

===Football===

VMI played its first football game in 1871. The one-game season was a 4–2 loss to Washington and Lee University. There are no records of a coach or any players for that game. VMI waited another twenty years, until 1891, when head coach Walter Taylor would coach the next football team. The current head football coach at VMI, Scott Wachenheim, was named the 31st head coach on December 14, 2014. The Keydets play their home games out of Alumni Memorial Field at Foster Stadium, built in 1962. VMI won the 2020 Southern Conference Football Championship, their first winning football season since 1981.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===

Perhaps the most famous athletic story in VMI history was the two-year run of the 1976 and 1977 basketball teams. The 1976 squad advanced within one game of the Final Four before bowing to undefeated Rutgers in the East Regional Final, and in 1977 VMI finished with 26 wins and just four losses, still a school record, and reached the &quot;Sweet 16&quot; round of the NCAA tournament.

The current VMI basketball team is led by head coach Dan Earl and assistant coaches: Steve Enright and Austin Kenon. Tom Kiely is the director of Basketball Operations.

==Alumni==

VMI&#x27;s alumni include: former governors of Virginia (Ralph Northam, Westmoreland Davis); the 25th secretary of the Army (Ryan D. McCarthy); a five-star general, secretary of state, secretary of defense, and Nobel Peace Prize recipient (George C. Marshall); Pulitzer Prize winners, 13 Rhodes Scholars, Medal of Honor recipients, an Academy Award winner, an Emmy Award and Golden Globe winner, a martyr recognized by the Episcopal Church, senators and representatives, governors, lieutenant governors, a Supreme Court justice, numerous college and university presidents, many business leaders (presidents and CEOs) and over 285 general and flag officers, including service chiefs for three of the four armed services.

Two recent chiefs of engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers, Lieutenant Generals Carl A. Strock and Robert B. Flowers, as well as Acting Chief of Engineers Major General &quot;Bo&quot; Temple, were VMI Civil Engineering graduates.

==Endowment==
A 2007 study by the National Association of College and University Business Officers found that VMI&#x27;s $343 million endowment was the largest per-student endowment of any U.S. public college in the United States. 35.4 percent of the approximately 12,300 living alumni gave in 2006. Private support covers more than 31 percent of VMI&#x27;s operating budget; state funds, 26 percent.

==In popular culture==

* Ronald Reagan starred in the films &quot;Brother Rat&quot; and &quot;Brother Rat and a Baby&quot;, which were filmed at VMI. Originally a Broadway hit, the play was written by John Monks Jr. and Fred F. Finklehoffe, both 1932 graduates of VMI.
* Both the novel and film &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; depict Stonewall Jackson teaching at VMI before Virginia secedes. The film also depicts Jackson&#x27;s funeral at VMI.
* In 2014, the film &quot;Field of Lost Shoes&quot; premiered in Richmond to the Corps of Cadets and the cast. The film depicts the Battle of New Market in 1864. VMI now owns and operates this historical battlefield museum and site.
* The VMI marching song is referenced and in part performed in the documentary &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;.

<text>White Castle (), also known historically as Llantilio Castle, is a ruined castle near the village of Llantilio Crossenny in Monmouthshire, Wales. The fortification was established by the Normans in the wake of the invasion of England in 1066, to protect the route from Wales to Hereford. Possibly commissioned by William fitz Osbern, the Earl of Hereford, it comprised three large earthworks with timber defences. In 1135, a major Welsh revolt took place and in response King Stephen brought together White Castle and its sister fortifications of Grosmont and Skenfrith to form a lordship known as the &quot;Three Castles&quot;, which continued to play a role in defending the region from Welsh attack for several centuries.

King John gave the castle to a powerful royal official, Hubert de Burgh, in 1201. Over the next few decades, it passed back and forth between several owners, as Hubert, the rival de Braose family, and the Crown took control of the property. During this period, White Castle was substantially rebuilt, with stone curtain walls, mural towers and gatehouses, forming what the historian Paul Remfry considers to be &quot;a masterpiece of military engineering&quot;. In 1267 it was granted to Edmund, the Earl of Lancaster, and remained in the hands of the earldom, and later duchy, of Lancaster until 1825.

Edward I&#x27;s conquest of Wales in 1282 removed much of White Castle&#x27;s military utility, and by the 16th century it had fallen into disuse and ruin. The castle was placed into the care of the state in 1922, and is now managed by Cadw, the Welsh heritage agency.

==History==
===11th–12th centuries===
White Castle was built in the wake of the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Shortly after the invasion, the Normans pushed into the Welsh Marches, where William the Conqueror made William fitz Osbern the Earl of Hereford; Earl William added to his new lands by capturing the towns of Monmouth and Chepstow. The Normans used castles extensively to subdue the Welsh, establish new settlements and exert their claims of lordship over the territories.
Originally called Llantilio Castle, White Castle was one of three fortifications built in the Monnow valley around the same time, possibly by Earl William himself, to protect the route from Wales to Hereford, and overlooked the manor of Llantilio Crossenny and the River Monnow. The first castle on the site was built from earth and timber, with three large earthworks forming an inner and outer ward, and a hornwork protecting the main entrance to the south. A mill was constructed at Great Trerhew to grind corn for the castle garrison.

The earldom&#x27;s landholdings in the region were slowly broken up after William&#x27;s son, Roger de Breteuil, rebelled against the Crown in 1075. In 1135, a major Welsh revolt took place, and in response King Stephen restructured the landholdings along this section of the Marches, bringing White Castle and its sister fortifications of Grosmont and Skenfrith back under the control of the Crown to form a lordship known as the &quot;Three Castles&quot;.

Conflict with the Welsh continued, and following a period of detente under Henry II in the 1160s, the de Mortimer and de Braose Marcher families attacked their Welsh rivals during the 1170s, leading to a Welsh assault on nearby Abergavenny Castle in 1182. In response, the Crown readied the castle to face an attack and, between 1184 and 1186, work costing £128 was carried out by Ralph of Grosmont, a royal official, probably to build a stone curtain wall around the inner ward and to add a small stone keep to the defences.

===13th–17th centuries===

In 1201, King John gave the Three Castles to Hubert de Burgh. Hubert was a minor landowner who had become John&#x27;s household chamberlain when he was still a prince, and went on to become an increasingly powerful royal official once John inherited the throne. At this time, White Castle was primarily a military fortification, holding a garrison and stores of arrows and crossbow bolts. It was relatively exposed to the elements and had, at best, only basic accommodation; the historian Cathcart King describes the conditions in the castle as likely to have been &quot;miserable&quot;, &quot;squalid&quot; and &quot;unpleasant&quot;.

Hubert began to upgrade his new castles, starting with Grosmont, but was captured while fighting in France. During Hubert&#x27;s captivity, King John took back the Three Castles and gave them to William de Braose, a rival of Hubert&#x27;s. King John subsequently fell out with William and dispossessed him of his lands in 1207, but de Braose&#x27;s son, also called William, took the opportunity presented by the First Barons&#x27; War to retake the castles.

Once released, Hubert regained his grip on power, becoming the royal justiciar and being made the Earl of Kent, before finally recovering the Three Castles in 1219 during the reign of King Henry III. Hubert fell from power in 1232 and was stripped of the castles, which were placed under the command of Walerund Teutonicus, a royal servant; having been reconciled with the King in 1234, the castles were briefly returned to Hubert, but he fell out with King Henry III again in 1239 and they were taken back and assigned to Walerund. Walerund built a new hall, buttery and pantry at the castle in 1244. In 1254, White Castle and its sister fortifications were granted to King Henry&#x27;s eldest son, and later King, Prince Edward.
During the 13th century, the castle was almost entirely rebuilt, although historians have put forward two possible timelines for when this work was carried out. The conventional historical dating places the construction in the 1250s and 1260s, as a single programme of work consisting in the keep being demolished, a new gatehouse and four mural towers constructed and the outer ward reinforced with a stone wall and gatehouse of its own. Paul Remfry argues that the work occurred somewhat earlier during Hubert&#x27;s tenure, being carried out in two waves between 1229–1231 and 1234–1239. Around this time the fortification is first described in the records as the &quot;White Castle&quot;, due to the white rendering applied to its external walls.

The Welsh threat persisted, and in 1262 the castle was readied in response to Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd&#x27;s attack on Abergavenny in 1262; commanded by its constable Gilbert Talbot, Grosmont was ordered to be garrisoned &quot;by every man, and at whatever cost&quot;. The threat passed without incident.

Edmund, the Earl of Lancaster and the &quot;capitaneus&quot; of the royal forces in Wales, was given the Three Castles in 1267 and for many centuries they were held by the earldom, later duchy, of Lancaster. King Edward I&#x27;s conquest of Wales in 1282 removed much of White Castle&#x27;s military utility, although it continued to be used in the administration of the surrounding manor, and for mustering military levies. Little further work was carried out on the fortification, although one of the gatehouse towers was repaired at some point, and repairs were carried out to the chapel tower and gatehouse under King Henry VI. By 1538, White Castle had fallen into disuse and then into ruin; a 1613 description noted that it was &quot;ruynous and decayed&quot;.

===18th–21st centuries===
In 1825, the Three Castles were sold off to Henry Somerset, the sixth Duke of Beaufort. In 1902, his descendant Henry Somerset, the 9th Duke, sold White Castle to Sir Henry Mather Jackson. Evidence was given to the Royal Commission on Ancient Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire in 1909, stating that Sir Henry had taken steps to strip the castle of ivy and that it was now in a good condition; the site was apparently looked after by an old woman, who charged visitors for entry. The castle was placed into the care of the state in 1922. In the 21st century, White Castle is managed by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw and is protected under UK law as a grade I listed building.

==Architecture==

White Castle occupies a hill near the village of Llantilio Crossenny, overlooking the surrounding landscape. The castle dates mainly from the 13th century and is made up of a central inner ward, a crescent-shaped hornwork to the south, and an outer ward to the north, with its stonework constructed from red sandstone. The outer ward was originally much larger, extending around the castle further to the east, but only limited traces of these earthworks survive. It is now entered from the north-east although, before the 13th century, the entrance was originally on the south side. The historian Paul Remfry considers the castle to be &quot;a masterpiece of military engineering&quot; for the period.

The outer ward is across, accessed by a gatehouse on the eastern edge and defended by a stone curtain wall, a dry ditch and four mural towers. The gatehouse, which survives up to in height, originally had a portcullis and a drawbridge. Three of the towers were circular in design, but one was rectangular and would have been used as lodgings for a household official. There was a large building, probably a barn, across, on the north-western edge of the ward, alongside a group of smaller buildings, but all have since been lost.

The inner ward is approximately across, protected by a deep, revetted, water-filled moat, dug out of the rock. The curtain wall has four circular, four-storey towers and a gatehouse, with domestic buildings reaching around the insides of the defences. The four-storey gatehouse is flanked by two circular towers and would originally have had a portcullis and a drawbridge. It would originally have been used by the castle&#x27;s constable or steward. Stretching eastwards from the gatehouse are the castle&#x27;s hall, the constable&#x27;s living quarters, the chapel – partially contained in one of the towers- the remains of the earlier keep, service buildings and the kitchen block. Only the foundations of these buildings survive. A postern gate in the inner ward leads through to the southern hornwork, which would originally have been linked by a wooden bridge, protected by timber defences and towers, with later stone additions, of which only traces remain.

White Castle has unusual arrow loops, with the two arms of a conventional cross-shaped loop offset vertically, so that one side is higher than the other. Historians have contrasting views of the effectiveness of this design; they might have been a sensible way to ensure that the defenders could shoot down the slopes around the castle, or to give better protection from incoming shot, although tests in 1980 showed them to have been extremely vulnerable to incoming shots.

<text>Friedrich Münzer (22 April 1868 – 20 October 1942) was a German classical scholar noted for the development of prosopography, particularly for his demonstrations of how family relationships in ancient Rome connected to political struggles. He died in Theresienstadt concentration camp.

==Biography==

He was born at Oppeln, Silesia (now Opole, Poland), into a Jewish merchant family, went to Leipzig University and then in 1887 to Berlin University, where he wrote his thesis &quot;De Gente Valeria&quot; under the supervision of Otto Hirschfeld. In 1893 he traveled to Rome, where Georg Wissowa recruited him to write biographical articles for the &quot;Realencyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft&quot;. From there he went to Athens and participated in excavations on the Acropolis. He also met Clara Engels there; they were married two years later, on 4 September 1897.

Meanwhile, Münzer had been appointed as an unsalaried lecturer at University of Basel in 1896; he and Clara were supported by their parents and his article-writing. (When applying for the job, he reported himself as a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church; three years earlier his CV had said he was of Jewish faith.) He was promoted to the second chair in classical philology in 1902. In 1912 he accepted a post at Königsberg, which made him an official in the German civil service.

Clara died in the Spanish flu pandemic on 15 December 1918; and in 1921, the widower took up a post at the University of Münster. His greatest work, &quot;Römische Adelsparteien und Adelsfamilien&quot; (Roman noble parties and noble families&quot;) had appeared in 1920 and brought him fame for the first time.

He was appointed a dean at the university in 1923, and in 1924 married a widow, Clara Lunke &quot;née&quot; Ploeger, becoming a stepfather to two teenagers.

===Nazi persecution===

Münzer was generally apolitical, but politics began to catch up with him in 1933 in the form of the law that sought to dismiss Communists, &quot;non-Aryans&quot;, and opponents of the Nazi Party. Civil servants appointed before 1914 were officially exempt, but his biographers attribute his continued employment to the intercession of influential colleagues and former students. In January 1935 a new law required the removal of all lecturers and professors over the age of 65 (a move to make available more posts for Nazi sympathizers), and Münzer formally retired on 23 July 1935.

His wife died in 1935 as well, and on 14 November of that year he was officially classified as Jewish, upon which many colleagues and acquaintances distanced themselves from him. Nevertheless, he continued to write biographical articles for Pauly-Wissowa, and they continued to accept them, in spite of a law forbidding Jews to publish. In 1938 a new law compelled him to adopt a Jewish middle name, and he became officially known as &quot;the Jew Friedrich Israel Münzer&quot;. In a letter of 12 December 1938 to Ronald Syme, he wrote that the changed situation &quot;deeply depressed&quot; him, but that he still considered himself better off than many others.

Despite the urgings of some friends, he refused to emigrate. But in July 1942 he was taken by the Gestapo to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. His adopted daughter Margerete won some privileges for him, such as the right to send and receive letters, and to receive his suitcase intact, and ultimately a release from Theresienstadt. But an epidemic of enteritis had been sweeping through the camp, and he succumbed to it the very same day that Margerete received the notice that her father was to be released.

<text>Die Toten Hosen are a German punk rock band from Düsseldorf. The name is taken from the German slang idiom &quot;tote Hose&quot; (literally &quot;dead trousers&quot;), which means &quot;nothing happening&quot;; &quot;boring&quot;. The band has had an important success through the years, and it has built a loyal following both in Europe and South America, being particularly popular in their home country and in Argentina.

== History ==
The current members of Die Toten Hosen are Campino (Andreas Frege), Kuddel (Andreas von Holst), Vom (Stephen Ritchie), Andi (Andreas Meurer) and Breiti (Michael Breitkopf). All members except one, Vom, who is English, are German, though Campino&#x27;s mother, Jenny, was also English. Vom joined in 1999, after previous drummer Wölli sustained injuries in a car crash. Wölli had played from 1985 to 1999 and was an honorary member of the band until his death in 2016. The drummer until 1985 was Trini Trimpop, who became the band&#x27;s manager when Wölli joined.

The band is reputed to have played for free at private birthday parties or similar events in their early years, so long as the host provided them with unlimited beer and covered all damage caused by the band.

=== 1982–1987 ===
Die Toten Hosen formed in 1982 at the Ratinger Hof, a Düsseldorf bar frequented by punk musicians. Its founder members were Campino and Andreas von Holst, both from local punk band ZK, with Andreas Meurer, Michael Breitkopf, Trini Trimpop and Walter November. According to their friend and one time promoter Andrea Berzen, they chose the name &quot;Die toten Hosen&quot; – which literally translates as &quot;the dead trousers&quot; but suggests the German idiom &quot;tote Hose&quot;, meaning &quot;nothing going on&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s boring&quot; – over &quot;Die Pariser&quot;. According to Andrea Berzen, Campino preferred the former because it implied that their concerts might not be sold out, but there might be &quot;tote Hose&quot; on the nights.

At their first concert at the Bremer Schlachthof over Easter 1982, the compère mistakenly introduced them as Die Toten Hasen (The Dead Hares). The debut single &quot;Wir sind bereit&quot; (&quot;We are ready&quot;) was released in 1982, and was followed by their first album, &quot;Opel-Gang&quot;, the next year.

Guitarist Walter November left the band in November 1983 due to his drug problems. One of the two A sides of the third single was the drinking song &quot;Eisgekühlter Bommerlunder&quot; (&quot;ice-cold Bommerlunder&quot; schnapps), which received considerable radio airplay and increased their fan base. The band released their first album titled &quot;Opel-Gang&quot; in early 1983 on their own label Totenkopf (skull).

In July 1983, the band signed to EMI, who financed a video for &quot;Eisgekühlter Bommerlunder&quot;, directed by Wolfgang Büld. It depicts a chaotic wedding ceremony in a small Bavarian church, with Kurt Raab playing an alcoholic priest and Marianne Sägebrecht playing the bride. After the filming the congregation called for the church to be reconsecrated. German public television refused to screen the video for several years for fear of offending churchgoers.

At the end of 1983, they released &quot;Hip Hop Bommi Bop&quot;, a hip-hop version of &quot;Eisgekühlter Bommerlunder&quot;, featuring New York rapper Fab Five Freddy.

In 1984, the band played a session on the BBC&#x27;s John Peel Show. EMI were displeased with the band&#x27;s high travel costs and by Norbert Hähnel publicly parodying their million-selling artist Heino at a Toten Hosen concert. Heino successfully obtained a court order to cease and desist. Die Toten Hosen left EMI and signed to Virgin Records. Their second album &quot;Unter Falscher Flagge&quot; (&quot;Under False Colours&quot;), was released in 1984. The title explained the front cover of the LP, which carried a picture of the band members dressed as pirates aboard a ship. The original back cover featured the skeleton of a dog sitting in front of a gramophone, a caricature of the His Master&#x27;s Voice entertainment trademark. Legal action by EMI (who owned the rights to His Master&#x27;s Voice in Europe at the time) prompted the album cover to be changed to the skeleton of an eagle, which, along with the Jolly Roger, became a band logo.

In Spring 1985, the band toured France for the Goethe Institute and in Autumn they travelled to Hungary and Poland. In late 1985, Trini Trimpop moved from drumming for the band into their management, where he worked until 1992. Jakob Keusen briefly replaced him as the band&#x27;s drummer before Wolfgang Rohde (Wölli) took over in January 1986. Rohde&#x27;s first concert was also the band&#x27;s first concert in front of a very large audience. Along with Herbert Grönemeyer, Udo Lindenberg, Marius Müller-Westernhagen, BAP, the Rodgau Monotones and many others, they performed at the Anti-WAAhnsinns-Festival in July 1986 to protest the construction of the nearby Nuclear reprocessing plant Wackersdorf.

In 1986, they recorded their third album, &quot;Damenwahl&quot; (Ladies&#x27; Choice). The Damenwahl tour was sponsored by the northern German condom manufacturer Fromms, who arranged for free samples to be scattered amongst the crowd. In 1987, the band celebrated its first chart success with the record &quot;Never Mind the Hosen, Here&#x27;s Die Roten Rosen&quot; (&quot;Never mind the Trousers – Here&#x27;s the Red Roses&quot;) using the pseudonym Die Roten Rosen (The Red Roses). The album contains rock versions of German 1960s pop songs. The name and cover art of the record are a parody of &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; by the Sex Pistols (1977).

In late 1987, Die Toten Hosen released their first live album &quot;Bis zum bitteren Ende&quot; (Till the Bitter End). It charted in the German and Austrian Top 30.

=== 1988 to 1995: Recognition and early success ===
In 1988, the band released their commercial breakthrough, the album &quot;Ein kleines bisschen Horrorschau&quot; (A little bit of horrorshow). The album referenced the Anthony Burgess&#x27;s novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film of the same name and was largely written for Bernd Schadewald&#x27;s theatre adaption of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. For half a year the band played on stage at the Kammerspiele Bad Godesberg theatre in Bonn, alongside Ralf Richter, the play&#x27;s lead actor. In September 1988, Die Toten Hosen performed at the Lituanika Festival in Vilnius and Kaunas, Lithuania. They were chosen by the jury as the best band of the event. The album included &quot;Hier kommt Alex&quot; (&quot;Here comes Alex&quot;) was later re-recorded in an unplugged version in 2005, incorporating the opening piano phrase of Beethoven&#x27;s Moonlight Sonata.

Their spring tour in 1989 included a sell-out performance at the huge Westfalenhallen in Dortmund. The band released (3 Chords for a Hallelujah), a video documentary of their lives. In 1990, the Toten Hosen were invited to attend the New Music Seminar in New York and performed as support for The Rolling Stones in Cologne. That summer the band travelled to Italy to report on the FIFA World Cup for various newspapers and radio stations. For this purpose they recorded a rock cover version of &quot;Azzurro&quot; by Adriano Celentano, accompanied by a video satirising the behaviour of German football fans when abroad. The double album &quot;Kreuzzug ins Glück&quot; (Crusade to happiness) was released in 1990 and sold over 150,000 copies in its first week.

In 1991 the Toten Hosen released their album &quot;Learning English Lesson One&quot;, a tribute to the band&#x27;s musical influences, consisting mainly of cover versions of English punk rock classics. Each track featured at least one member of the original band that had recorded it. Several songs were recorded in Rio de Janeiro with Great Train Robber Ronald Biggs. The album also marked the beginning of the band&#x27;s collaboration with T.V. Smith, songwriter and lead singer of The Adverts, which continues to the present day.

The band&#x27;s 1992 &#x27;Menschen, Tiere, Sensationen&#x27; (People, Animals, Sensations) tour included concerts in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Great Britain, Spain, France and a their first ever dates in Argentina.
The single &quot;Sascha … ein aufrechter Deutscher&quot; (&quot;Sascha... an upstanding German&quot;) was released for Christmas 1992 as a vehement condemnation of right-wing radicalism. The proceeds of this song were donated to an anti-racist charity campaign in Düsseldorf. The right-wing Republikaner party failed in its attempt to have the song banned for defamation and thereby unintentionally contributed to the success of the single. The song grossed half a million Deutsche Mark.

In 1993, the album &quot;Kauf MICH!&quot; (Buy ME!) was released and reached number one in the German charts. Its songs express opinions on consumerism, advertisement and right-wing extremism. In the summer of 1993 Die Toten Hosen performed as the supporting act for U2 on their Zoo TV tour in Germany, with audiences of over 50,000 people at each concert. The video to the song &quot;Kauf MICH!&quot; showed footage of these concerts. In the same year, the band released Reich &amp; Sexy (Rich &amp; Sexy), their first best-of album. On the cover the members of the band are naked, portraying pretentious millionaires from the music industry surrounded by nude women. An international version of the best-of album was released in 1994 called &quot;Love, Peace &amp; Money&quot;. For a period, Die Toten Hosen had three albums in the German charts at the same time.

In 1994 the band was on the road for almost the entire year in Germany and neighbouring countries. In November they gave four concerts in the US and in Canada as support act for Green Day. Starting in April 1995, the Toten Hosen got their own radio program on Fritz radio in Berlin, called &quot;Tausend Takte Tanzmusik&quot; (&quot;a thousand beats of dance music&quot;). The show aired every Sunday from 7 to 8 p.m. for a year. At the end of the year the band founded their own record label JKP.

=== 1996 to 2020: JKP – beginnings with their own label ===
The first album under their own label was &quot;Opium fürs Volk&quot; (opium for the people), released in 1996. Its songs deal with faith and religion. The album went platinum, their third record to do so, after &quot;Kauf MICH!&quot; and &quot;Reich und sexy&quot;. The single &quot;Zehn kleine Jägermeister&quot; (ten little master huntsmen or rather: ten little Jägermeisters) went to number one of the German-speaking singles charts. Die Toten Hosen and Iggy Pop were a supporting act at the Ramones farewell concert in the River-Plate-Stadion of Buenos Aires in front of 75,000 people. An extended tour followed under the slogan &quot;Ewig währt am längsten&quot; (Eternity lasts longest) through Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Furthermore, they performed at the Gurtenfestival, the Forestglade Festival, the Berlin Waldbühne and at the Bizarre Festival in Cologne. In May 1996 they headlined the Rock am Ring festival. In the same year the band released their second live album &quot;Im Auftrag des Herrn&quot; (on the Lord&#x27;s behalf).

Their 1000th concert was on 28 June 1997 in the Düsseldorfer Rheinstadium, and was attended by over 60,000 fans. Lack of effective crowd control resulted in a crowd collapse which injured a reported 70 people, and caused the death of Rieke Lax, a 16 year old Dutch girl. The band later released the song &quot;Alles ist eins&quot; (Everything is one) in her memory.

The 1998 Warped Tour took in New Zealand, Australia, Japan and Hawaii. Campino was twice hospitalised after concerts in Byron Bay and Geelong in Australia.

Die Toten Hosen have collaborated with numerous other musicians (like Bad Religion, AC/DC, U2, Rolling Stones); they are also one of the few German punk bands popular outside Germany, with a large following in South America, Australia and Eastern Europe.

The band&#x27;s members are passionate fans of their local football team, Fortuna Düsseldorf, which they sponsored from 2001 to 2003. When a goal is scored at the club&#x27;s ground, the Esprit Arena, the chorus of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Strom&quot; is played. The band released a football-themed song named &quot;Bayern&quot; in 2000 in which they proclaim that they would not join Bayern Munich under any circumstances. Campino mentioned that the band lost significant CD sales in southern Germany after the release of the song.

In August 2006, Campino starred as Mack the Knife in Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; at Berlin&#x27;s Admiralspalast, a short distance from the theatre where the play premiered in 1928. The director, famous actor Klaus Maria Brandauer, was criticised for the play&#x27;s unadventurous staging, but Campino was cheered by the audience.

Artist Andreas Gursky produced &quot;Tote Hosen&quot;, a blown up photograph of the crowd from a Die Toten Hosen concert, depicting youths excitedly cheering for the band, many wearing the red Hosen shirt. It is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.

Faith No More bassist Billy Gould wore a Toten Hosen tee shirt on the cover of their greatest hits album, &quot;Midlife Crisis: The Very Best of Faith No More&quot;. Faith No More have covered the Toten Hosen song &quot;Hofgarten&quot; in live shows.

German rock group Samsas Traum covered &quot;Hier kommt Alex&quot; with a more gothic sound. Lead singer Alexander Kaschte changes the final lyric to &quot;Hey! Ich bin Alex!&quot; (Hey! I am Alex!) as a wry joke. British punk band UK Subs recorded an English-language cover of the song on their 1993 album &quot;Normal Service Resumed&quot;. &#x27;&quot;Hier kommt Alex&quot; is featured in video games &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; (European version). The song was also released as a downloadable track on the American version of Rock Band on 27 May 2008. Die Toten Hosen also have a special edition of SingStar for PlayStation 2, devoted exclusively to the band, featuring 24 tracks and videos from over the decades, which was released in 2007.

MC Frontalot, in collaboration with faux-German electronic musician KOMPRESSOR on the track &quot;Rappers We Crush&quot;, rhymes &quot;What did I do to deserve this?/What was my crime?/Was it because I sampled Die Toten Hosen that one time?&quot;

In 2002 and 2005, the band played at Przystanek Woodstock, the biggest open air festival in Europe. In 2010, the band played several dates in Central Asia and became the first foreign rock band to perform in Tajikistan since 1991. The band was criticised for accepting €68,000 of German government funding towards this tour. On 2 October 2010, the band played in Amman, Jordan, their first concert in the Middle East.

In 2012, Die Toten Hosen released their album &quot;Ballast der Republik&quot;. A special edition includes a bonus CD with cover versions of songs that influenced the band. On 26 April 2016, it was announced that former drummer Wolfgang Rohde had died of cancer.

In early 2018, members of Die Toten Hosen recorded backing vocals on Australian band The Living End&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Wunderbar&quot;, which was recorded in Germany.

On November 27, 2020, the single &quot;You&#x27;re No Good&quot; was issued online.

== Musical style ==
All band members are self-taught musicians. At the beginning of their musical career most of them were still at school. Their first album was recorded in a studio rented by the hour. The band kept to simple guitar chords and lyrics, in garage style. Die Toten Hosen were mainly influenced by punk bands from the 1970s, to whom they frequently pay tribute in recorded work and live performances. On occasion they have played songs by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Some of the band&#x27;s songs have been described as &quot;Schunkelpunk&quot;, a fusion of German schlager music and punk, exemplified by &quot;Eisgekühlter Bommerlunder&quot;, numerous cover versions of German schlager songs and tracks such as &quot;Azzurro&quot;. They can be seen as pioneers of &quot;Volxmusic&quot;, which combines elements of German folk music with jazz, hip-hop or rock. In some of their songs Die Toten Hosen experiment with strings or wind instruments. A few songs have elements that are lifted from jazz (e.g. &quot;Warum werde ich nicht satt&quot;), reggae (&quot;Zehn kleine Jägermeister&quot;) or Yugoslavian gypsy music (&quot;Das Mädchen aus Rottweil&quot;).

For the most part, The Toten Hosen have not departed substantially from their original style of music, choosing power chords, straightforward lyrics, simple melodies and anthem-like choruses over long instrumental solos. Other influences on the music of Die Toten Hosen include hardcore punk, punk blues, heavy metal, thrash metal, and hard rock.

The focus of the band&#x27;s music has gradually shifted from funny and nonsensical to serious. The songs from the band&#x27;s first LP were mostly about having fun, but by the end of the 1980s they were focusing more on political and social issues such as racism.

== Social involvement ==
=== Political activities ===
The band openly support political and social organizations in their music, interviews and by donations, but are not affiliated with any political party. They turned down a request from Germany&#x27;s SPD (Social Democratic Party) to write a song for their European election campaign in 1994.

In 1991, their track &quot;Fünf vor Zwölf&quot; (&quot;It is high time&quot;) was published on the sampler &quot;Nazis raus&quot; (Nazis get out) and in 2006 they supported the band ZSK&#x27;s &quot;Kein Bock auf Nazis&quot; (can&#x27;t stand Nazis) campaign. In 1992, the band participated in a demonstration against xenophobia in Bonn. They performed together with Herbert Grönemeyer, Nina Hagen and others for nearly 200,000 demonstrators. In 1995 they supported Greenpeace, IPPNW, &quot;Aktion Atomteststop&quot; (an initiative for a nuclear test ban), the BUND (German &quot;Friends of the Earth&quot; chapter) and they were featured on the track &quot;Tout Pour Sauver L&#x27;Amour&quot; (&quot;Everything to save love&quot;) on the &quot;Stop Chirac&quot; compilation album.

In 2002, the band attracted publicity by posing undressed for posters of the animal rights group PETA under the slogan &#x27;Lieber nackt als im Pelz&#x27; (Better naked than in fur). in 2005 they funded &quot;On the Run&quot;, a compilation album to raise funds for immigrants&#x27; rights organisation Pro Asyl, and contributed the song &quot;Meine Stadt&quot; (&quot;My town&quot;).

From 1999 to 2004 their web site had a public discussion forum but this was terminated without explanation.

=== Ties to Düsseldorf ===
Over the course of the band&#x27;s history, Die Toten Hosen have expressed their loyalty to their home town in various ways. In summer 1995, the band staged an ice hockey game called &quot;Powerplay des Wahnsinns&quot; (Power-play of insanity), playing in a team alongside professional players from Düsseldorfer EG against a team composed of Finnish rock band Leningrad Cowboys and Finnish national ice hockey players. The match took place in the stadium at the Brehmstrasse in Düsseldorf. Their team &quot;Knochenbrecher Düsseldorf&quot; (Düsseldorf Bonebreakers) lost 9:10. In 1996 they slipped into women&#x27;s clothing, silk stockings and high heels and took part in the Düsseldorf Mardi Gras parade with their own float under the slogan &quot;We bury good taste&quot;.

Die Toten Hosen are supporters of the football club Fortuna Düsseldorf. At the end of the 1980s, they helped the club by donating 200,000 DM towards signing the player Anthony Baffoe. From 2001 to 2003, they sponsored the club after it had experienced major financial difficulties. In 2002, the band signed an advertising contract with the Diebels Brewery, and donated the proceeds to the club&#x27;s &quot;Nachwuchs&quot; (youth side), who wear the band&#x27;s skull emblem on their shirts.

Die Toten Hosen have reserved space for 17 people at Düsseldorf&#x27;s Südfriedhof cemetery, where they wish to be buried.

<text>Alpha Flight is a fictional team of Canadian superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The characters premiered in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #120 (April 1979), and were created to serve as part of the X-Men member Wolverine&#x27;s backstory. Marvel published an &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; comic book series from 1983 to 1994. The team serves as Marvel&#x27;s premier Canadian superhero team akin to America&#x27;s Avengers.

==Publication history==
Created by British-born Canadian-raised writer and artist John Byrne, the team&#x27;s leader - Weapon Alpha (later renamed to Guardian), first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #109. The full team then first appeared in a two-part story in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #120 and 121. Byrne never intended the team to be an ongoing title. He created them &quot;merely to survive a fight with the X-Men&quot; for the purposes of that story. Marvel convinced Byrne to feature them in their own series as a way to capitalize on Byrne&#x27;s soaring popularity with comics fans at the time, but he never found them to have compelling stories or backgrounds and left the title after writing and pencilling the first 28 issues. The series continued until 1994, lasting 130 issues as well as annuals and miniseries. There have been three short-lived revivals since then, most recently an eight-issue limited series in 2011–12, after the resurrection of the team in the one shot comic &quot;Chaos War: Alpha Flight&quot; during the &quot;Chaos War&quot; event.

Most team members have distinctly Canadian attributes, such as having Inuit/First Nations or French heritage. Throughout most of its history, the team has worked for Department H, a fictional branch of Canada&#x27;s Department of National Defence that deals with super-powered villains.

==Fictional team biography==
===The Flight===
Alpha Flight was preceded by a team called &quot;The Flight&quot;. This team first appeared in &quot;Alpha Flight Special&quot; vol. 2 #1 (1992).

Inspired by the debut of the Fantastic Four, James Hudson refined the purpose of Department H to find and/or develop Canada&#x27;s superheroes. New recruit Groundhog joins Snowbird, St. Elmo, Stitch, Wolverine (as Weapon X) and Smart Alec in training. Within a week, the Flight is pressed into their first battle with Egghead&#x27;s incarnation of the Emissaries of Evil (consisting of Rhino, Solarr, Eel, Porcupine, Power Man and Swordsman). Egghead threatens the United States from Canadian soil with a nuclear missile. Smart Alec disables the missile&#x27;s guidance system, but Egghead triggers the detonation sequence. Smart Alec panics, leading to St. Elmo transforming the missile and the bomb into light. St. Elmo succeeds, but loses himself in the process. Groundhog and Dr. Michael Twoyoungmen scold Hudson for sending the team into battle while so inexperienced, with a near psychotic leader (Weapon X) and someone who folds under pressure. Hudson thus makes plans for a tiered team system, leading to the formation of Alpha, Beta and Gamma Flight.

===Pre-regular series===
Alpha Flight first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #120 (April 1979), in which they are sent to follow up on Vindicator&#x27;s first mission to retrieve Wolverine from the X-Men (&quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #109).

The initial makeup of (Alpha Flight) was drawn from all corners of Canada and included:

* Guardian: Originally Weapon Alpha, then Vindicator, James MacDonald Hudson is a scientist from London, Ontario who wears a suit of battle-armor, allowing him to fly and manipulate Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Guardian is the team&#x27;s first leader; he wears a stylized Canadian maple leaf flag on his costume.
* Northstar: Jean-Paul Beaubier from Montreal, Quebec is a mutant with powers of super-speed and light generation.
* Aurora: Jeanne-Marie Beaubier is Northstar&#x27;s twin sister who suffers from dissociative identity disorder (multiple personalities). Like her brother, she is also a mutant with powers of super-speed, flight, light generation, and molecular acceleration.
* Sasquatch: Walter Langowski is a scientist from Vancouver, British Columbia who can transform into a giant fur-covered beast resembling a Sasquatch. This character originally developed his powers from a Hulk-inspired gamma radiation experiment that was affected by a solar-flare. Eventually, it was explained that Sasquatch is actually a mystical monster.
* Shaman: Michael Twoyoungmen is a First Nations medicine man from Calgary, Alberta. He is both a skilled doctor and sorcerer.
* Snowbird: Also known as Narya, she is an Inuit demi-goddess from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories who can transform into animals of the north.

According to Byrne, both Guardian and Snowbird were &quot;fan characters&quot;, created before he became professionally involved in comics, and he created all the remaining members while working on &quot;X-Men&quot; #120, specifically designing them to be balanced with the X-Men in power.

===Volume 1===
The first &quot;(Alpha Flight)&quot; comic book series started in 1983 which ran until 1994.

Promoted from Beta Flight despite Department H being closed down by the Canadian government were:
* Marrina: An amphibious woman from Newfoundland, she was a former member of Beta Flight before joining Alpha Flight. She is actually part of an extraterrestrial invading force known as the Plodex.
* Puck: Eugene Judd is a dwarf bouncer from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan with enhanced strength and extraordinary acrobatic abilities.

Heather MacNeil is married to James Hudson. After Guardian&#x27;s apparent death in &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; #12, she becomes the leader of the team. Later, she utilizes a replica of his battle suit and costume and takes the codename of Vindicator then Guardian.

&quot;Alpha Flight&quot; continued for 130 issues, and introduced dozens of characters and villains (the most prominent of which were Talisman, Madison Jeffries, Box, Diamond Lil, Wild Child, Persuasion, and Witchfire).

Limited-Series (1991)
This limited series, published from July to October of 1991, reprints Alpha Flight (Volume 1) #97-#100.

===Volume 2===
In 1997, Marvel relaunched the series with different characters. The new additions to the roster included:

* Flex: Adrian Corbo is a mutant with the ability to transform his limbs into sharp weapons. He is the half-brother of Radius.
* Manbot: Bernie Lechenay is a human/Box robot cyborg.
* Murmur: Arlette Truffaut is a young mutant from Quebec City, Quebec with powers of mind-control and teleportation.
* Radius: Jared Corbo is a mutant with the ability to create a force field.
* General Clarke: The sinister new director of Department H, responsible for many of the dark plots surrounding the team. Gains some measure of redemption with his sacrifice in issue #12.

Returning members were Vindicator (Heather Hudson, with a new costume and new geothermal powers), a de-aged Guardian (who turned out to be a clone of the original James Hudson, set at age 19), and Puck. Sunfire was also briefly a member while looking for a cure to a crippling illness.

The focus of this series was on Department H&#x27;s consistently hidden agenda and Alpha Flight&#x27;s reluctance to comply thereto. The conspiracy plotline saw Department H allowing an incarnation of the Zodiac Cartel to kidnap Madison Jeffries, who was subsequently brainwashed into becoming the group&#x27;s &quot;Gemini&quot;. To keep the group from interfering with their &quot;deal&quot;, Department H brainwashed the team into forgetting Jeffries&#x27; kidnapping. Also, Department H employed an actual sasquatch as the new team&#x27;s version of Sasquatch, without telling the team that it was not Walter Langkowski. Department H also arranged the kidnapping of Diamond Lil, another former Alpha Flight member and Madison Jeffries&#x27; wife, when she began to inquire about the location of her husband, with the intent of using her as a test subject for illegal medical experiments.

The series ended with issue #20 with most of the major storylines, such as the identity of the younger version of Guardian, unresolved, until &quot;Wolverine&quot; vol. 2 #142-143, when the plotline was resolved with the return of the real Guardian and the heroic sacrifice of the clone version.

===Volume 3: &quot;All-New, All-Different&quot; Alpha Flight===
In 2004, Marvel started a new volume of Alpha Flight, with the &quot;All-New, All-Different&quot; prefix.

The new team recruited by Sasquatch includes:

* Centennial: Rutherford B. Princeton III is a 97-year-old man whose mutant powers of superhuman strength, invulnerability, flight, and heat vision manifested after being awakened from a coma by Sasquatch.
* Major Mapleleaf: Lou Sadler is the son of a World War II super-hero of the same name. He is secretly a normal human who rides a superpowered horse.
* Nemesis: Amelia Weatherly is both an adversary and ally of the old Alpha Flight. She has the power of flight and is skilled with a magical blade.
* Puck II: Zuzha Yu is the daughter of the original Puck. She has superhuman strength, speed, and agility.
* Yukon Jack: Also known as Yukotujakzurjimozoata, he is a mysterious man from a primitive tribe, bought from his father by Sasquatch.

&quot;Waxing Poetic&quot;, the second six-issue story arc, sees the return of some original team members as both the original versions visited in the past, and temporal copies brought to the present. These members were Guardian, Vindicator, Puck, and Shaman.

===Omega Flight===

Sasquatch, Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, Major Mapleleaf II, and both Pucks are attacked by a new villain, the Collective (inhabiting the body of U.S. postal worker Michael Pointer), in &quot;New Avengers&quot; #16. Pointer continues on to the United States, leaving their bodies in the Yukon Territory.

The &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; title was relaunched as &quot;Omega Flight&quot; in April, 2007 as a five-issue mini-series. The new series was written by Michael Avon Oeming and drawn by Scott Kolins. The current roster includes Beta Ray Bill, U.S. Agent, Arachne, Talisman, and Michael Pointer in a suit that looks like Guardian&#x27;s uniform. Sasquatch appears as the group&#x27;s recruiter and leader. Since the mini-series, the team disbanded. Beta Ray Bill exited; U.S. Agent joined Hank Pym&#x27;s new Avengers team; Pointer, now calling himself Omega, joined Norman Osborn&#x27;s Dark X-Men; and Julia Carpenter became the new Madame Web.

===&quot;Chaos War&quot;===

In the 2010 storyline the &quot;Chaos War&quot;, the four mainstay surviving members of Alpha Flight (Snowbird, Aurora, Northstar and Sasquatch) are reunited with Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman and Marrina Smallwood returning from the grave after Amatsu-Mikaboshi&#x27;s victory in the death realms. The group bands together to fight the Great Beasts. Amatsu-Mikaboshi impales the Great Beasts. The resurrected members of Alpha Flight remain among the living after the defeat of Amatsu-Mikaboshi. At the same time, Puck appears in the &quot;Wolverine Goes to Hell&quot; storyline in &quot;Wolverine&quot; (2010), beginning in issue #2.

===Volume 4===
In 2011, the team appeared in a series tied to the crossover storyline &quot;Fear Itself&quot;, with the newly alive team to be joined by Puck. Alpha Flight provides rescue efforts for the victims of a tsunami unleashed by Attuma in the form of Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans. As Sasquatch, Shaman, and Vindicator help save victims of the water itself, Guardian saves a news crew when their helicopter is shot down by Nerkodd. As Marrina Smallwood and Aurora also arrive to help fight Nerkodd, the female reporter that Guardian saved comments to the television viewers on why Northstar isn&#x27;t with the team.

After providing rescue efforts for victims of the disaster, Guardian ejects Nerkodd from the country by dumping him off the coast of Cape Race. Once Nerkodd is defeated and repelled, Alpha Flight returns to their headquarters and are betrayed by Gary Cody and his newly elected Unity Party. To make things worse, Vindicator has sided with him. It is shown that six weeks ago, Guardian and Vindicator were unable to regain custody of their child Claire. In the present, Marrina is dehydrated, Sasquatch&#x27;s gamma energy is drained enough for him to revert to his human form of Walter Langkowski, and Aurora and Snowbird are taken down as well. While bringing Guardian to the Box Units for imprisonment, Vindicator is ambushed by Puck. After knocking out Vindicator, Puck tells Guardian that he had just returned to life after his fight with Ba&#x27;al.

At Parliament Hill, Walter is informed by Agent Jeff Brown that the concussions he had when he played football will cause him to act less human when he changes back into Sasquatch. Jeff also tells Walter that he will soon achieve Unity. Meanwhile, Marrina pretends to give in to the Unity treatment so that she can break free. Shaman manages to knock out Jeff and frees Walter, while Guardian frees Snowbird. Northstar and Puck manage to find Marrina, who has knocked out the guards and scientists present. After Alpha Flight escaped, they learned that Gary Cody and his Unity Party are a group of fascists. Northstar abducts a Department H operative and uses aerial torture in order to learn where Department H took Kyle Jinadu.

After reclaiming her daughter Claire from her cousin, Vindicator assembles Alpha Strike (consisting of Persuasion, Ranark, a Wendigo, and a brainwashed Citadel) in order to spread the Unity program and take down Alpha Flight. It is soon discovered that Master of the World is behind the Unity Party, the formation of Alpha Strike and what has happened to Department H as he introduces himself to Kyle Jinadu.

Alpha Flight ends up robbing a treasury in order to fund a special tactical training from Taskmaster in an isolated Yukon Territory. While overseeing the formation of a revolution against the Unity Party, Guardian, Sasquatch, and Shaman hatch a desperate and dangerous plan that involves the bad personality of Aurora. Aurora&#x27;s personality begins to cause her to become unstable to herself and Alpha Flight. Meanwhile, Master of the World explains his history involving the Plodex to Claire. Alpha Flight manages to rescue Kyle Jinadu and encounter Wolverine.

At a beach in Ontario with Claire, Vindicator is visited by Wolverine who states that the people in the United States are becoming concerned about the Unity Party&#x27;s actions. When Wolverine notices that Vindicator calls the rest of Alpha Flight traitors, Wolverine decides to investigate. Wolverine finds Alpha Flight and learns of their revolution against the Unity Party. He agrees to help them take back Canada just as Alpha Strike attacks. During the ensuing fight, Alpha Flight managed to capture Persuasion as she is a component for a cure that would be used against the Unity Process. Alpha Flight, Wolverine, and Taskmaster are then prepared to take Canada back as Master of the World comes out of hiding.

Master of the World begins his attack on Parliament Hill with Agent Jeff Brown and Claire Hudson present in his spaceship. He even manages to kill Gary Cody, his purpose served. Guardian continues to fight Vindicator as she orders the rest of Alpha Strike to free Persuasion and destroy the machine connected to her.

Alpha Flight defeats Alpha Strike. Vindicator (still under of Master of the World&#x27;s mental control) helps Alpha Flight against Master of the World when he attempts to kill Claire. Alpha Flight successfully creates the machine to free the people that Master of the World had under his mental control. They kill Master of the World, but Vindicator flies away with Claire. Afterward, Alpha Flight celebrates after the Unity Party is abolished.

Alpha Flight later aids Red Hulk when the Mayan Gods appear on Earth. The battle results with Aurora, Sasquatch, and Snowbird in a coma, but they recover.

===Space program version===
A different version of Alpha Flight debuted as part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event. This version is a space program that becomes Earth&#x27;s line of defense from extraterrestrial threats and resides in the Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station. Its members include Captain Marvel, Abigail Brand, Aurora, Puck and Sasquatch. The first wing of the Triskelion is where the ground crew of the Alpha Flight space program resides.

Black Panther also sent a group of Alpha Flight explorers to search for the origin of the Mena Ngai. While exploring the Vega System, the explorers&#x27; travels took them through a temporal anomaly into the past, where they established over the next two-thousand years the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, named after their homeland.

During the &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, it is revealed that the Alpha Flight Space Program is overseen by its Board of Governors which consists of representatives of the different nations of Earth and other planets that share the Alpha Flight Space Program&#x27;s interests. Known members of the Alpha Flight Space Program&#x27;s Board of Governors are Black Panther of Wakanda, Henry Peter Gyrich of the United States, Philippe Beaulieu of Canada (revealed to be a revived Master of the World in disguise), Mentor of the Shi&#x27;ar, Bar-Konn of the Kree, an unnamed Rigellian ambassador, and an unnamed Kronan ambassador.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; crossover, Alpha Flight assisted Captain Marvel with protecting Earth from a Chitauri invasion, but were trapped in space once Captain America activated a force field around Earth.

In order to track down Hulk after he escaped from General Reginald Fortean&#x27;s custody, a depowered Walter Langkowski started the space program&#x27;s version of Gamma Flight.

===Return of the original team===
The original lineup of Alpha Flight would be revived as Canada&#x27;s top superhero team once more in their post-space program years consisting of Guardian, Aurora, Northstar, Snowbird, Sasquatch, Puck and Marrina.

===Volume 5===
During the &quot;Fall of X&quot; relaunch, the human members of Alpha Flight (Guardian, Snowbird, Shaman, and Puck) are ordered by Department H to hunt down mutants after the anti-mutant organization Orchis manipulates the Canadian government including Department H director Erika Doiran into declaring Canadian mutants like Argent threats to the country. The team&#x27;s actions puts them at odds with their former mutant members Northstar and Aurora, who are joined by Aurora&#x27;s lover and Wolverine&#x27;s son Fang and the new Nemesis, later revealed to be Heather Hudson, with both sides battling each other. Unbeknownst to Department H and the public, the two Alpha Flight factions are secretly working with each other to help smuggle Canadian mutants off-world to Shi&#x27;ar space. However, Alpha Flight becomes compromised when Department H deploys Box Sentinels to apprehend Canadian mutants. While Alpha Flight succeeds in sending the refugees to Chandilar with their ruse getting discovered in the process and the cost of Argent getting killed by the Box Sentinels, the remaining human members are arrested by Department H for treason with a comatose Heather Hudson ending up in their medical quarters. Doiran later did a lot of cover-ups during a press conference where she declined to comment on certain questions.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Adventures===
In issue #11 of &quot;Marvel Adventures Iron Man&quot;, Tony Stark travels to Nunavut to try to find his father Howard. As he is flying through a series of mountains, he is attacked by Alpha Flight after Northstar and Aurora mistake him for a training robot built by Guardian. After the real drone appears, Sasquatch and Guardian make some hasty apologies before Iron Man continues on his mission. Later in the issue, Alpha Flight aids Iron Man in a battle against the Living Laser.

===Marvel Zombies===
A zombified version of Alpha Flight (consisting of Guardian, Northstar, Aurora, Sasquatch, Puck, and Snowbird) appeared in the first issue of &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot;, attacking the X-Men at the Xavier Institute for Gifted Youngsters, and killing Professor X in the process. They are later killed by Magneto, who uses his powers to make various metallic objects pierce their brains.

===Old Man Logan===
In &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; vol. 2 #17, Logan is shown a vision of the dead Alpha Flight (consisting of Guardian, Northstar, Aurora, Sasquatch, Puck and Snowbird) by a young Jean Grey.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; reality, Alpha Flight debuted in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #94 with Vindicator (formally Col. John Wraith of Weapon X), Shaman (John Proudstar), Jubilee, Sunfire, Sasquatch (Rahne Sinclair), Snowbird (Danielle Moonstar), and Aurora. The team ambushes the X-Men in the middle of a friendly baseball game. All of its members appear to use godlike powers; they easily defeat the X-Men and kidnap Northstar. It is later revealed by Wolverine, who apparently has a history with them, that they used a drug called &quot;Banshee&quot; to enhance their abilities, making them more powerful than normal mutants. Vindicator claims that Alpha Flight is the first internationally sanctioned mutant team made powerful enough to take on any &quot;considerable&quot; threats such as the Liberators, the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy, and the Ultimates, as Vindicator sees the latter as loyal only to America and Alpha Flight to the world. They are defeated by Colossus&#x27;s team of X-Men who were also being powered by Banshee.

===What If?===
Alpha Flight was featured in the different &quot;What If?&quot; stories:

* In &quot;What If The All-New All-Different X-Men Had Never Existed,&quot; Wolverine is shown to be the leader of Alpha Flight when they are loaned to the Japanese government who needed help dealing with Moses Magnum when the Japanese government was unable to reach the Avengers. Both Alpha Flight and the X-Men defeated Moses Magnum.
* In &quot;What If Wolverine Was Leader Of Alpha Flight?&quot;, the team succeeded in capturing Logan after their fight with the X-Men. In this reality, Logan did not escape from Canadian custody and slip aboard the X-Men&#x27;s plane. The team chose to turn back around and mount a rescue. The military called Department H to get them to talk the X-Men out of it before the military handled it. Northstar was on monitor duty and chose not to respond. The military then shot the X-Men down- none of them survived the crash. Hudson told Logan face to face with nobody between them, half expecting Logan to kill him. Instead, he told Hudson that since his new family was dead, he had nothing left but to stay with Alpha Flight. He immediately led a mission into the Negative Zone to rescue their Beta and Gamma Flight trainees Puck, Marrina, Smart Alec, Wild Child, Flashback and Box, who had been kidnapped by Annihilus during an experiment by Department H scientists to open doorways to other dimensions. Hudson couldn&#x27;t lead the rescue mission as Vindicator- he had to stay behind and operate the machinery that controlled the Negative Zone gateway. Wolverine led Shaman, Northstar, Aurora, Sasquatch and Snowbird in, and not only rescued their people, but negotiated peace with Annihilus. He taught Wild Child to control his savagery and got the team to bond better than Hudson ever could, but Northstar was always nervous around Wolverine because of what he did. Hudson knew what would happen if Logan ever learned about Northstar&#x27;s role in the X-Men&#x27;s deaths. Their worst fear happened when Professor X and the surviving X-Men (Iceman, Havok, Beast, Angel) called for help. The Hellfire Club had captured them all and transformed Jean Gray into Dark Phoenix. Alpha Flight rescued them, but Dark Phoenix telepathically showed Wolverine what Northstar did. She tried to get him to kill Northstar, but he killed her instead to free her from the curse of Dark Phoenix. Hudson expected Logan to quit the team, but Logan surprised him by forgiving Northstar and agreeing to stay on as leader of Alpha Flight.
* In &quot;What if... Wolverine had battled Weapon X?&quot;, the Flight members were in the middle of their training when Guy Desjardins (Weapon X) breaks free after the eponymous program left Desjardins in the hands of Department H.

==Collected editions==
==In other media==

<text>Lu is the pinyin and Wade–Giles romanization of several distinct Chinese surnames that are written with different characters in Chinese. Depending on the character, it may be spelled Lú, Lǔ, or Lù when pinyin tone diacritics are used. Lu 盧 and Lu 陸 are the most common: both are among the 100 most common surnames in China. Languages using the Latin alphabet do not distinguish among the different Chinese surnames, rendering them all as Lu.

==List of surnames romanized as Lu==
*Lú 卢/盧 (2nd tone), the 52nd most common surname in China. &quot;Lo&quot; in Cantonese. The character also means &quot;black&quot;.
*Lù 陆/陸 (4th tone), the 61st most common surname in China. &quot;Luk&quot; in Cantonese. The character also means &quot;land&quot;.
*Lǔ 鲁/魯 (3rd tone), the 115th most common surname in China. &quot;Lo&quot; in Cantonese. The character also means &quot;rude&quot; or “foolish”, but the name originated from the ancient State of Lu.
*Lù 路 (4th tone), the 116th most common surname in China. &quot;Lo&quot; in Cantonese. The character also means &quot;road&quot;.
*Lú 芦/蘆 (2nd tone), the 140th most common surname in China. &quot;Lo&quot; in Cantonese. The character also means &quot;reed&quot;.
*Lù 禄/祿 (4th tone), not among the top 300 surnames in China. &quot;Luk&quot; in Cantonese. The character also means &quot;salary&quot;.
*Lù 逯 (4th tone), not among the top 300 surnames in China. &quot;Luk&quot; in Cantonese. The character also means &quot;leaving without reason&quot;.
*Lù 鹿 (4th tone), not among the top 300 surnames in China. &quot;Luk&quot; in Cantonese. The character also means &quot;deer&quot;.

==Lü==
The surname Lü 吕/呂 (&quot;Lui&quot; in Cantonese) is often romanized as Lu (also Lv and Lyu) when input of the double-dot is not possible.

==People surnamed &quot;Lu&quot; with unknown character==
* Jessica Lu, American actress, model, and spokesperson
* Margaret Lu, Filipino-born American fencer
* Fanny Lu, stage name of Fanny Lucía Martínez Buenaventura (born February 8, 1973), Colombian singer, songwriter

<doc id="345320" wikidata="Q517349" url="?curid=345320" title="Elizabeth Thompson">
<text>Elizabeth Southerden Thompson (3 November 1846 – 2 October 1933), later known as Lady Butler, was a British painter who specialised in painting scenes from British military campaigns and battles, including the Crimean War and the Napoleonic Wars. Her notable works include &quot;The Roll Call&quot; (purchased by Queen Victoria), &quot;The Defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift&quot;, and &quot;Scotland Forever!&quot; (showing the Scots Greys at Waterloo). She wrote about her military paintings in an autobiography published in 1922: &quot;I never painted for the glory of war, but to portray its pathos and heroism.&quot;&lt;br&gt;She married British Army officer William Butler, becoming Lady Butler after he was knighted.

==Early life and education==
Born at the Villa Claremont in Lausanne, Switzerland, Butler was the daughter of Thomas James Thompson (1812–1881) and his second wife, Christiana Weller (1825–1910). Her sister was the noted essayist and poet Alice Meynell. Elizabeth began receiving art instruction in 1862, while growing up in Italy. In 1866, she entered the Female School of Art in South Kensington in London. She began exhibiting her artwork, usually watercolours, as a student. In 1867, one watercolour, &quot;Bavarian Artillery Going into Action&quot;, was shown at the Dudley Gallery, one of the galleries preferred by women artists. The same year, she exhibited an oil painting, &quot;Horses in Sunshine&quot;, at the Society of Female Artists.

She became a Roman Catholic along with the rest of her family after they moved to Florence in 1869. While in Florence, under the tutelage of the artist Giuseppe Bellucci (1827–1882), she attended the Accademia di Belle Arti. She signed her works as E.B. (post-1877), Elizth. Thompson, or Mimi Thompson (she was called &quot;Mimi&quot; from her childhood).

== Artistic career ==

Initially concentrating on religious subjects like &quot;The Magnificat&quot; (1872), upon going to Paris in 1870, she was exposed to battle scenes from Jean Louis Ernest Meissonier and Édouard Detaille, and switched her focus to war paintings. With the painting &quot;Missing&quot; (1873), a Franco-Prussian War battle scene depicting the common soldiers&#x27; suffering and heroism, she earned her first submission to the Royal Academy. Her painting &quot;The Roll Call,&quot; which depicted a line of soldiers worn out with conflict, was shown in 1874 at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and became so popular that a policeman had to be stationed next to the painting in order to regulate the crowds that came to see it. Butler later wrote that after the opening of the Summer Exhibition, she awoke to find herself famous.

Her fame increased as the paintings toured Europe, along with photographs of Elizabeth. She gained even more notice because people found out that she was both young and pretty, something normally not associated with painters of battle scenes. It also helped that during this time, there was a huge swell of Victorian pride and romanticism for the growing British Empire. While Lady Butler&#x27;s topics reflected such romanticism, her paintings were generally realistic in detail, with aspects such as confusion, mud and exhaustion being accurately portrayed. Her works tend to focus on British troops shown in action, or shortly after it, but avoiding scenes of hand-to-hand combat. The troops are often shown as their opponents might have seen them, but relatively few of the opponents themselves are shown.

In 1879, Butler came within two votes of becoming the first woman to be elected as an Associate Member of the Royal Academy (apart from two founder Members, Mary Moser and Angelica Kauffman; ultimately, the first female Associate Member was Annie Swynnerton, elected in 1922, and the first full Member was Laura Knight in 1936).

After her marriage in 1877 to William Francis Butler, a distinguished British Army officer, from County Tipperary, Ireland, she travelled to the far reaches of the Empire with her husband and raised their six children. Butler also produced some black and white illustrations, including of poems by her sister, Alice Meynell, and of works by Thackeray. Lady Butler exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts and The Woman&#x27;s Building at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Her elder daughter, Elizabeth, married Lt.-Col. Randolph Albert Fitzhardinge Kingscote (6 Feb 18678 Dec 1940) on 24 July 1903 and her younger daughter, Eileen, married Viscount Gormanston (16 July 18797 November 1925) on 26 October 1911.

== Later life and death ==
On her husband&#x27;s retirement from the Army, she moved to Ireland, where they lived at Bansha Castle, County Tipperary. Lady Butler showed pictures at the Royal Hibernian Academy from 1892. Among the paintings that she took with her to County Tipperary was a set of water-colours that she had painted while stationed with her husband in Palestine. During the Irish Civil War these were transferred to her daughter for safekeeping at Gormanston Castle, then Viscount Gormanston&#x27;s London townhouse, where almost all were destroyed during the Second World War.

Widowed in 1910, Lady Butler lived at Bansha Castle until 1922, when she took up residence with the youngest of her six children, Eileen, Viscountess Gormanston, at Gormanston Castle, County Meath. She died there in 1933 shortly before her 87th birthday being interred at nearby Stamullen churchyard.

Butler was included in the 2018 exhibit &quot;Women in Paris 1850–1900&quot;, whilst the 2023 play &quot;Modest&quot; covered her life from &quot;Roll Call&quot; to her rejection as an Associate of the Royal Academy.

<doc id="345322" wikidata="Q4866000" url="?curid=345322" title="Barycentric Coordinate Time">
<text>Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB, from the French Temps-coordonnée barycentrique) is a coordinate time standard intended to be used as the independent variable of time for all calculations pertaining to orbits of planets, asteroids, comets, and interplanetary spacecraft in the Solar System. It is equivalent to the proper time experienced by a clock at rest in a coordinate frame co-moving with the barycenter (center of mass) of the Solar System : that is, a clock that performs exactly the same movements as the Solar System but is outside the system&#x27;s gravity well. It is therefore not influenced by the gravitational time dilation caused by the Sun and the rest of the system.
TCB is the time coordinate for the Barycentric Celestial Reference System (BCRS).

TCB was defined in 1991 by the International Astronomical Union, in Recommendation III of the XXIst General Assembly. It was intended as one of the replacements for the problematic 1976 definition of Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). Unlike former astronomical time scales, TCB is defined in the context of the general theory of relativity. The relationships between TCB and other relativistic time scales are defined with fully general relativistic metrics. The transformation between TCB and Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) may be approximated with an uncertainty not larger than formula_1 in rate as:

formula_2
where formula_3 and formula_4 are the barycentric coordinate position and velocity of the geocenter, formula_5 with formula_6 the barycentric position of the observer, formula_7, formula_8 is the origin of TCB and TCG defined so that 1977 January 1, 00:00:00 TAI is 1977 January 1, 00:00:32.184 TCG / TCB, formula_9 is the sum formula_10 of gravitational potentials for all solar system bodies apart from the Earth evaluated at the geocenter, and formula_11 is similarly the sum formula_12. The approximation discards higher powers of formula_13 as they have been found to be negligible.

Because the reference frame for TCB is not influenced by the gravitational potential caused by the Solar System, TCB ticks faster than clocks on the surface of the Earth by 1.550505 × 10−8 (about 490 milliseconds per year). Consequently, the values of physical constants to be used with calculations using TCB differ from the traditional values of physical constants (The traditional values were in a sense wrong, incorporating corrections for the difference in time scales). Adapting the large body of existing software to change from TDB to TCB is an ongoing task, and many calculations continued to use TDB in some form.

Time coordinates on the TCB scale are specified conventionally using traditional means of specifying days, inherited from slightly non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used. For continuity with its predecessor Ephemeris Time, TCB was set to match ET at around Julian Date 2443144.5 (1977-01-01T00Z). More precisely, it was defined that TCB instant 1977-01-01T00:00:32.184 corresponds exactly to the International Atomic Time (TAI) instant 1977-01-01T00:00:00.000, at the geocenter. This is also the instant at which TAI introduced corrections for gravitational time dilation.

<text>Taylor Gun-Jin Wang (; born June 16, 1940) is a Chinese-born Taiwanese-American scientist and in 1985, became the first person of Chinese origin to go into space. While an employee of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Wang was a payload specialist on the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; mission STS-51-B.

==Early life and education==

With ancestry in Yancheng, Jiangsu, Republic of China, Wang was born in Shanghai to Wáng Zhāng () and Yú Jiéhóng (). He moved to Taiwan in 1952 with his family. He studied his later part of elementary school in Kaohsiung, and graduated from the Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei, Taiwan. He later moved to Hong Kong. 

Wang started studying physics at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1963. He received his Bachelor of Science in 1967, his Master of Science in 1968, and his Ph.D. in low temperature physics (superfluid and solid state physics) in 1972.

==Career and research==

After completing his doctorate, Wang joined the California Institute of Technology&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 1972, as a senior scientist. At JPL he was responsible for the inception and development of containerless processing science and technology research. He was the Principal Investigator (PI) on the Spacelab 3 mission NASA Drop Dynamics (DDM) experiments, PI on the NASA SPAR Flight Experiment #77-18 &quot;Dynamics of Liquid Bubble,&quot; PI on the NASA SPAR Flight Experiment #76-20 &quot;Containerless Processing Technology,&quot; and PI on the Department of Energy Experiment &quot;Spherical Shell Technology.&quot;

He gained US citizenship in 1975, and published a paper on the dynamic behavior of rotating spheroids in zero gravity the next year. The paper received attention in NASA, and Wang was selected as a payload specialist on June 1, 1983, for the Spacelab-3 mission.

Wang conducted precursor drop dynamics experiments for the DDM in ground-based laboratories employing acoustic levitation systems, neutral buoyancy systems and drop towers, and in the near-weightless environment provided by JSC&#x27;s KC-135 airplane flights and SPAR rockets. These flights have helped to define the experimental parameters and procedures in the DDM experiments performed on Spacelab 3. He is the inventor of the acoustic levitation and manipulation chamber for the DDM. (Wang, T.G., M. Saffren, D. Elleman and J.C. Fletcher (1975) Material Suspension Within an Acoustically Excited Resonant Chamber. U.S. Patent No. 3,882,732)

===Spaceflight===

Wang flew on STS-51-B &quot;Challenger&quot; (April 29 – May 6, 1985). STS-51B/Spacelab-3 was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the first operational Spacelab mission. The seven-man crew aboard &quot;Challenger&quot; conducted investigations in crystal growth, drop dynamics leading to containerless material processing, atmospheric trace gas spectroscopy, solar and planetary atmospheric simulation, cosmic rays, laboratory animals and human medical monitoring.

Wang was the principal designer of an experiment called the Drop Dynamics Module, which aimed to uncover the fundamental physical behavior of liquid drops in microgravity. Despite his extensive preparation, the experiment malfunctioned upon activation. Wang, feeling immense pressure and aware of the high expectations from the Chinese community, became deeply despondent. When Wang&#x27;s experiment failed, he desperately negotiated with NASA flight controllers for a chance to repair it, even threatening not to return if not allowed to fix the instrument, telling NASA flight controllers &quot;Hey, if you guys don&#x27;t give me a chance to repair my instrument, I&#x27;m not going back.&quot; Wang received permission to attempt a fix and was successful in repairing the experiment, though his remark caused concern for the safety of the crew and the mission.

The incident was covered in an &quot;Ars Technica&quot; article on 22 January 2024. There, John Fabian, mission specialist on STS-51-G, the very next shuttle flight after 51-B, was cited to explain why a lock was recently installed on the door of the side hatch: &quot;It was installed when we got into orbit so that the door could not be opened from the inside and commit &quot;hara-kiri&quot;, kill the whole crew. That was not because of anybody we had on our flight but because of a concern about someone who had flown before 51-G.&quot;
At mission conclusion, Wang traveled over 2.9 million miles in 110 Earth orbits, and logged over 168 hours in space. While it was a successful mission, STS-51B mission commander Overmyer discovered while serving on the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster investigation team that 51-B had had a similar problem with its O-rings during the launch. Morton Thiokol engineers told Wang&#x27;s crewmate Don Lind that &quot;you came within three-tenths of one second of dying&quot;.

===Post-spaceflight research===

Using insights from compound droplet experiments performed in the microgravity of NASA Shuttle Mission STS-51-B, Dr. Taylor Wang, has developed an immunoisolation encapsulation system that protects cellular transplants, and sustains cell function — without immunosuppression drugs and their resulting negative side effects. This novel immunoisolation system is a multi-component, multi-membrane capsule that allows independent optimization of all capsule design parameters ensuring reproducible functions in large animals and humans. Results of Encapsulife&#x27;s successful large animal trials, have recently been published in peer-reviewed research in Transplantation Journal. In this landmark research, encapsulated canine pancreatic islets were transplanted into dogs rendered diabetic by total pancreatectomy. No immunosuppression or anti-inflammatory therapy was used. The allotransplantations of encapsulated islets were well tolerated and biocompatible, and normalized fasting blood glucose levels in all of 9 dogs, were achieved for over two hundred days, with a single transplantation. Re-transplantation of encapsulated islets — a &quot;booster&quot; — was effective in providing glycemic control beyond the initial 200 days.

===Professorship===

Wang later became a Centennial Professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He has written about 200 journal articles and holds 28 U.S. patents on acoustics, drops and bubble dynamics, collision and coalescence of drops, charged drop dynamics, containerless science, and encapsulation of living cells. His experiments were carried out in 1985 aboard United States Spacelab 3, and in 1992 aboard United States Microgravity Laboratory 1 (USML-1), and in 1995 aboard USML-2.

==Recognition==

Wang has received various honors and awards, including Space Flight Medal NASA 1985, Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal NASA 1987, Asian Pacific American Achievement Award 1989. Llewellyn J. Evans Distinguished Scientific, Engineering and Management Award 1994. Educational Award Vanderbilt University Alumni League 1996. He was awarded Asian American Engineer of the Year Distinguished Science and Technology Award, CIE-USA, National Engineers Foundation 2007. He addressed the United Nations&#x27; General Assembly in 1990 as part of the &quot;Only One Earth Day&quot;.

Wang is married to Beverly Feng () with two sons, Kenneth Wang and Eric Wang.

<doc id="345327" wikidata="Q157392" url="?curid=345327" title="Freesia">
<text>Freesia is a genus of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae, first described as a genus in 1866 by Christian Friedrich Ecklon (1886) and named after the German botanist and medical practitioner, Friedrich Freese (1795–1876). It is native to the eastern side of southern Africa, from Kenya south to South Africa, most species being found in Cape Provinces. Species of the former genus Anomatheca are now included in &quot;Freesia&quot;. The plants commonly known as &quot;freesias&quot;, with fragrant funnel-shaped flowers, are cultivated hybrids of a number of &quot;Freesia&quot; species. Some other species are also grown as ornamental plants.

==Description==
They are herbaceous plants which grow from a conical corm diameter, which sends up a tuft of narrow leaves long, and a sparsely branched stem tall bearing a few leaves and a loose one-sided spike of flowers with six petals. Many species have fragrant narrowly funnel-shaped flowers, although those formerly placed in the genus &quot;Anomatheca&quot;, such as &quot;F. laxa&quot;, have flat flowers.

Freesias are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the large yellow underwing.

==Systematics==
The genus was named in honor of Friedrich Heinrich Theodor Freese (1795–1876), a German physician.

; Species

* &quot;Freesia andersoniae&quot; - the Cape Provinces, Free State

* &quot;Freesia speciosa&quot; (syn. &quot;F. flava&quot; ) - the Cape Provinces
* &quot;Freesia verrucosa&quot; (syn. &quot;F. juncea&quot; ) - the Cape Provinces
* &quot;Freesia viridis&quot; - Namibia, the Cape Provinces

Species of the former genus &quot;Anomatheca&quot; are now included in &quot;Freesia&quot;:
* &quot;Anomatheca cruenta&quot; = &quot;Freesia laxa&quot; subsp. &quot;laxa&quot;
* &quot;Anomatheca grandiflora&quot; = &quot;Freesia grandiflora&quot;
* &quot;Anomatheca juncea&quot; = &quot;Freesia verrucosa&quot;
* &quot;Anomatheca laxa&quot; = &quot;Freesia laxa&quot;
* &quot;Anomatheca verrucosa&quot; = &quot;Freesia verrucosa&quot;
* &quot;Anomatheca viridis&quot; = &quot;Freesia viridis&quot;
* &quot;Anomatheca xanthospila&quot; = &quot;Freesia caryophyllacea&quot;

==Cultivation and uses==
The plants usually called &quot;freesias&quot; in horticulture and floristry are derived from crosses made in the 19th century between &quot;Freesia refracta&quot; and &quot;Freesia leichtlinii&quot;. Numerous cultivars have been bred from these species and the pink- and yellow-flowered forms of &quot;Freesia corymbosa&quot;. Modern tetraploid cultivars have flowers ranging from white to yellow, pink, red and blue-mauve. They are mostly cultivated professionally in the Netherlands by about 80 growers. Freesias can be readily increased from seed. Due to their specific and pleasing scent, they are often used in hand creams, shampoos, candles, etc.; however, the flowers themselves are mainly used in wedding bouquets.

&quot;Freesia laxa&quot; (formerly called &quot;Lapeirousia laxa&quot; or &quot;Anomatheca cruenta&quot;) is one of the other species of the genus which is commonly cultivated. Smaller than the scented freesia cultivars, it has flat rather than cup-shaped flowers.

<text>The Grand Bazaar (, meaning ‘Covered Market’; also , meaning ‘Grand Market’) in Istanbul is one of the largest and oldest covered markets in the world, with 61 covered streets and over 4,000 shops on a total area of 30,700 m2, attracting between 250,000 and 400,000 visitors daily. In 2014, it was listed No.1 among the world&#x27;s most-visited tourist attractions with 91,250,000 annual visitors. The Grand Bazaar at Istanbul is often regarded as one of the first shopping malls of the world.

== Location ==

The Grand Bazaar is located inside the walled city of Istanbul, in the district of Fatih and in the neighbourhood () bearing the same name (). It stretches roughly from west to east between the mosques of Beyazit and of Nuruosmaniye. The Bazaar can easily be reached from Sultanahmet and Sirkeci by trams (Beyazıt-Kapalıçarşı stop).

== History ==

The construction of the future Grand Bazaar&#x27;s core started during the winter of 1455/56, shortly after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople and was part of a broader initiative to stimulate economic prosperity in Istanbul. Sultan Mehmed II had an edifice erected devoted to the trading of textiles and jewels near his palace in Constantinople. It was named (&quot;Bedesten of Gems&quot;) and was also known as (&quot;New Bedesten&quot;) in Ottoman Turkish. The word is adapted from the Persian word &quot;bezestan&quot;, derived from &quot;bez&quot; (&quot;cloth&quot;), and means &quot;bazaar of the cloth sellers&quot;. The building – named alternately in Turkish (&quot;Internal&quot;), (&quot;Ancient&quot;), or (&quot;Old&quot;) Bedesten – lies on the slope of the third hill of Istanbul, between the ancient Fora of Constantine and of Theodosius. It was also near the first sultan&#x27;s palace, the Old Palace (), which was also in construction in those same years, and not far from the Artopoleia (in Greek) (), the city&#x27;s bakers&#x27; quarter in Byzantine times.

The construction of the Bedesten ended in the winter of 1460/61, and the building was endowed to the &quot;waqf&quot; of the Hagia Sophia Mosque. Analysis of the brickwork shows that most of the structure originates from the second half of the 15th century, although a Byzantine relief representing a Comnenian eagle, still enclosed on the top of the East Gate () of the Bedesten has been used by several scholars as proof that the edifice was a Byzantine structure.

In a market near the Bedesten, named in Turkish , the slave trade was active, a use also carried over from Byzantine times. Other important markets in the vicinity were the second-hand market (), the &quot;Long Market&quot; (), corresponding to the Greek &quot;Makros Embolos&quot; (, &quot;Long Portico&quot;), a long porticoed mall stretching downhill from the Forum of Constantine to the Golden Horn, which was one of the main market areas of the city, while the old book market () was moved from the Bazaar to the present picturesque location near the Beyazid Mosque only after the 1894 Istanbul earthquake.

Some years later—according to other sources, this occurred in 1545 under Sultan Suleiman I—Mehmed II had another covered market built, the &quot;Sandal Bedesten&quot; (the name comes from a kind of thread woven in Bursa, which had the colour of sandalwood), also named (&quot;Little&quot;), or (both words meaning &quot;New&quot;) Bedesten, which lay north of the first.

After the erection of the Sandal Bedesten the trade in textiles moved there, while the was reserved for the trade in luxury goods. At the beginning the two buildings were isolated. According to the 16th-century French traveller Pierre Gilles, between them and the Mosque of Beyazid stood the ruins of churches and a large cistern. However, soon many sellers opened their shops between and around them, so that a whole quarter was born, devoted exclusively to commerce.

At the beginning of the 17th century the Grand Bazaar had already achieved its final shape. The enormous extent of the Ottoman Empire in three continents, and the total control of road communications between Asia and Europe, rendered the Bazaar and the surrounding &quot;han&quot;s or caravanserais the hub of the Mediterranean trade. According to several European travelers, at that time, and until the first half of the 19th century, the market was unrivaled in Europe with regards to the abundance, variety and quality of the goods on sale. At that time we know from European travelers that the Grand Bazaar had a square plan, with two perpendicular main roads crossing in the middle and a third road running along the outer perimeter. In the Bazaar there were 67 roads (each bearing the name of the sellers of a particular good), several squares used for the daily prayers, 5 mosques, 7 fountains, 18 gates which were opened each day in the morning and closed in the evening. Around 1638 the Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi gave us the most important historical description of the Bazaar and of its customs. The number of shops amounted to 3,000, plus 300 located in the surrounding &quot;han&quot;s, large caravanserais with two or three stories round a porticoed inner courtyard, where goods could be stored and merchants could be lodged. In that period one tenth of the shops of the city were concentrated in the market and around it. For all that, at that time the market was not yet covered.

Recurrent calamities, fires and earthquakes hit the Grand Bazaar. The first fire occurred in 1515; another in 1548. Other fires ravaged the complex in 1588, 1618 (when the was destroyed), 1645, 1652, 1658, 1660 (on that occasion the whole city was devastated), 1687, 1688 (great damage occurred to the ) 1695, and 1701. The fire of 1701 was particularly fierce, forcing Grand Vizier Nevşehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha to rebuild several parts of the complex in 1730–1731. In 1738 the Kızlar Ağası Beşir Ağa endowed the Fountain (still existing) near Mercan Kapı.

In this period, because of the new law against fires issued in 1696, several parts of the market which lay between the two Bedesten were covered with vaults. Despite that, other fires ravaged the complex in 1750 and 1791. The quake of 1766 caused more damages, which were repaired by the Court Chief Architect () Ahmet a year later.

The 19th-century growth of the textile industry in western Europe, introduction of mass production methods, the capitulations signed between the Empire and many European countries, and the forestalling – always by European merchants – of the raw materials needed to produce goods in the Empire&#x27;s closed economy, were factors which caused the Market&#x27;s decline. By 1850, rents in Bedesten were ten times lower than two to three decades before. Moreover, the birth of a West-oriented bourgeoisie and the commercial success of Western products pushed the merchants belonging to the minorities (Greek, Armenian, Jewish) into moving out of the Bazaar, perceived as antiquated, and into opening new shops in quarters frequented by Europeans, such as Pera and Galata.

According to an 1890 survey, in the Bazaar there were 4,399 active shops, 2 &quot;bedesten&quot;, 2195 rooms, 1 &quot;hamam&quot;, one mosque, 10 medrese, 19 fountains (among them two &quot;şadırvan&quot; and one &quot;sebil&quot;), one mausoleum and 24 &quot;han&quot;. In the 30.7 hectares of the complex, protected by 18 gates, there are 3,000 shops along 61 streets, the 2 &quot;bedesten&quot;, 13 &quot;han&quot; (plus several more outside).

The last major catastrophe happened in 1894: a strong earthquake that rocked Istanbul. The Minister of Public Works, Mahmud Celaleddin Pasha, supervised the repair of the damaged Bazaar until 1898, and on this occasion the complex was reduced in area. To the west, the Bit Pazarı was left outside the new perimeter and became an open-sky road, named &quot;Çadırcılar Caddesi&quot; (&quot;Tentmaker Road&quot;), while the old gate and the &quot;Kütkculer Kapi&quot; were demolished. Among all the &quot;han&quot;s which belonged to the Market, many were left outside, and only nine remained enclosed in the structure.

In 1914 the Sandal Bedesten, whose handlers of textile goods had been ruined by the European competition, was acquired by the city of Istanbul and, starting one year later, was used as an auction house, mainly for carpets. In 1927 the individual parts of the bazaar and the streets got official names. The last fires of bazaar happened in 1943 and 1954, and the related restorations were finished on 28 July 1959.

The last restoration of the complex took place in 1980. On that occasion, advertising posters around the market were also removed.

==Architecture==

The Iç Bedesten has a rectangular plan (43.30 m x 29.50 m). Two rows of stone piers, four in each row, sustain three rows of bays, five in each row. Each bay is surmounted by a brick dome with blind drum. In the inner and in the outer walls have been built 44 cellars (), vaulted rooms without external openings. The sunlight in Bedesten comes from rectangular windows placed right under the roof: they can be accessed through a wooden ambulatory. Due to the scarce illumination, the edifice was kept open only some hours each day, and was devoted to the trade of luxury goods, above all textiles. Moreover, the Bedesten&#x27;s Mahzen were also used as safes. The building can be accessed through four gates: 
* &quot;Second-hand Book Sellers&#x27; Gate&quot; () in the north, 
* &quot;Skullcap Sellers&#x27; Gate&quot; () in the south,
* &quot;Jewellers&#x27; Gate&quot; () in the east, and;
* &quot;Women&#x27;s Clothiers&#x27; Gate&quot; () in the west.
The Sandal Bedesten has also a rectangular plan (40.20 m × 42.20 m), with 12 stone piers bearing 20 bays surmounted by brick domes with blind drum. In this case shops are carved only in the outer walls. In both edifices, each bay is tied to the others through brick arches tied by juniper beams, and masonry is made with rubble. Both buildings were closed by iron gates.

Aside from the bedestens, originally the Grand Bazaar structures were built with wood, and only after the 1700 fire, they were rebuilt in stone and brickwork, and covered. All the bazaar edifices, except the fur dealers market (), a later addition which is two-story, are one story. The roofs are mainly covered with tiles, while the part burnt in 1954 uses now tarmac. In the bazaar no artificial light was foreseen, also to prevent fires, and smoking was strictly prohibited. The roads outside the inner Bedesten are roughly parallel to it. The damages caused by the many fires and quakes along the centuries, together with the repairs done without a general plan, gave to the market – especially in its western part – a picturesque appearance, with its maze of roads and lanes crossing each other at various angles.

==Social history of the Grand Bazaar==

Until the restoration following the quake of 1894, the Grand Bazaar had no shops as found in the western world: along both sides of the roads merchants sat on wooden divans in front of their shelves. Each of them occupied a space in width, and in depth. This was named in Turkish , meaning &#x27;stall&#x27;. The most precious merchandise was not on display, but kept in cabinets. Only clothes were hung in long rows, with a picturesque effect. A prospective client could sit in front of the dealer, talk with him and drink a tea or a Turkish coffee, in a relaxed way. At the end of the day, each stall was closed with drapes. Another peculiarity was the complete lack of advertising. Moreover, as everywhere in the East, traders of the same type of goods were forcibly concentrated along one road, which got its name from their profession. The Inner Bedesten hosted the most precious wares: jewelers, armourers, crystal dealers had their shops there. The Sandal Bedesten was mainly the center of the silk trade, but also other goods were on sale there. The most picturesque parts of the market were – apart from the two Bedestens – the shoe market (), where thousands of shoes of different colors (Ottoman sumptuary laws prescribed yellow shoes for Muslims, blue for Greek Orthodox, black for Jews and red for Armenians) were on display on high shelves; the spice and herbs market (later concentrated in the Egyptian Bazaar), which stood near the jewelers; the armour and weapon market; the old book market; and the flea market.

This kind of organization disappeared gradually, although nowadays a concentration of the same business along certain roads can be observed again:
* Jewellers and gold bracelets along &quot;Kalpakçılar Caddesi&quot;;
* Gold bracelets along &quot;Kuyumcular Çarşısı&quot;;
* Furniture along &quot;Divrikli Caddesi&quot;;
* Carpets along &quot;Sahaflar Caddesi&quot;;
* Leather goods along &quot;Perdahçılar Caddesi&quot;
* Leather and casual clothes at the &quot;Bit Pazarı&quot;.

Actually, the main reason of concentrating the trade in one place was to provide the highest security against theft, fire and uprising. The goods in the Bedesten were guaranteed against everything except turmoil. Gates were always closed at night, and the bazaar was patrolled by guards paid by the merchants&#x27; guilds. In order to access the complex during night hours, an imperial edict was required. The only official night opening in the history of the Bazaar occurred in 1867 during the feast organized for the return of Sultan Abdülaziz from Egypt, when the sovereign crossed the illuminated market riding a horse among the rejoicing populace. Despite the immense wealth present in the Bazaar over the centuries—as an English traveller recorded as late as c. 1870, a tour of the inner Bedesten could easily ruin a few Rothschild families—theft occurred extremely rarely. The most important such incident happened in 1591, when 30,000 gold coins () were stolen in the old Bedesten. The theft shocked the whole of Istanbul, the Bazaar remained closed for two weeks and people were tortured, until the money was found hidden under a floor matting. The culprit was a young Persian musk seller. Thanks to the intercession of the Sultan Murad III he was executed by hanging and not by torture.
Right during the westernization of Ottoman society, the Grand Bazaar became an obligatory topos of the romantic literature. We owe descriptions of the Bazaar in the middle of the 19th century to writers such as Edmondo De Amicis and Théophile Gautier.

Another peculiarity of the market during the Ottoman age was the total lack of restaurants. The absence of women in the social life and the nomadic conventions in the Turkish society made the concept of restaurant alien. Merchants brought their lunch in a food box called &quot;sefertas&quot;, and the only food on sale was simple dishes such as doner kebab, tavuk göğsü (a dessert prepared with chicken breast, milk sugar and rose water sprinkled on it) and Turkish coffee. These simple dishes were prepared and served in small two-story kiosks placed in the middle of a road. The most famous among these kiosks is the one—still extant but not functioning any more—placed at the crossing of &quot;Halıcılar Caddesi&quot; and &quot;Acı Çesme Caddesi&quot;. It is alleged that Sultan Mahmud II came there often in disguise to eat his pudding. The Bazaar was in the Ottoman Age the place where the &quot;Istanbullu&quot; (the inhabitants of the city) could see each other. Not only was the market the only place in town where the ladies could go relatively easily (and this circumstance made the place especially interesting for the Europeans who visited the city), but—especially from the Tanzimat age on—it was also the only public place where the average citizen had a chance to meet the members of the Imperial Harem and of the Court casually.

The Bazaar&#x27;s merchants were organized in guilds. In order to establish a new one, it was only necessary to have enough traders of the same good. Afterwards, a monopoly was formed and the number of traders and shops was frozen. One could only be accepted in the guild through co-optation, either as son of a deceased member, or after paying a suitable sum to a member who wanted to retire.

The guild&#x27;s chief was a public officer called &quot;Kethüda&quot;. He was paid by the guild but appointed by the &quot;Kadı&quot; of Istanbul. Fixation of prices and taxes were matter of the &quot;Kethüda&quot;. He was joined by a representative of the guild&#x27;s member, called &quot;Yiğitbaşı&quot; (&#x27;chief of the brave young fellows&#x27;). These two officers were flanked by the assembly of the elders, non necessarily old in age, but comprising the most experienced traders. Parallel to the guilds, there were purely religious organizations, called &quot;fütüvvet tariks&quot;. Their members met in Dervish shrines and performed religious functions. These organizations became less and less important with time due to the increased weight of the Greek, Armenian and Jews merchants in the bazaar&#x27;s trade. Each guild had a financial department which collected a moderate monthly fee (some silver coins; ) from the members and administered it taking care of the needs of each associated person. The guilds lost increasingly their importance during the Tanzimat period, and were abolished in 1913, being replaced by an association of Bazaar merchants. Nowadays, there are several merchant associations in the Bazaar, but none is representative of the whole seller community.

==The Grand Bazaar today==
Today the Grand Bazaar is a thriving complex, employing 26,000 people visited by between 250,000 and 400,000 visitors daily, and one of the major landmarks of Istanbul. It must compete with modern shopping malls common in Istanbul, but its beauty and fascination represent a formidable advantage for it. The head of the Grand Bazaar Artisans Association claimed that the complex was in 2011 – the year of its 550th birthday – the most visited monument in the world. A restoration project starting in 2012 should renew its infrastructure, heating and lighting systems. Moreover, the &quot;han&quot;s inside the Market will be renovated and later additions will be demolished. This project should finally solve the big problems of the market: for example, in the whole Bazaar there is no proper toilet facility. Moreover, the lack of controls in the past years allowed many dealers to remove columns and skive walls in their shops to gain space; this, together with the substitution of lead (stolen in the last years) with concrete on the market&#x27;s roof, has created a great hazard when the earthquake expected in Istanbul in the next years will occur.

The Grand Bazaar is opened each day except Sundays and bank holidays from 9:00 until 19:00.

<doc id="345330" wikidata="Q155941" url="?curid=345330" title="Iridaceae">
<text>Iridaceae () is a family of plants in order Asparagales, taking its name from the irises. It has a nearly global distribution, with 69 accepted genera with a total of c. 2500 species. It includes a number of economically important cultivated plants, such as species of &quot;Freesia&quot;, &quot;Gladiolus&quot;, and &quot;Crocus&quot;, as well as the crop saffron.

Members of this family are perennial plants, with a bulb, corm or rhizome. The plants grow erect, and have leaves that are generally grass-like, with a sharp central fold. Some examples of members of this family are the blue flag and yellow flag.

==Etymology==
The family name comes from the genus &quot;Iris&quot;, the family&#x27;s largest and best-known genus in Europe. This genus dates from 1753, when it was coined by Swedish botanist, Carl Linnaeus. Its name derives from the Greek goddess, Iris, who carried messages from Olympus to earth along a rainbow, whose colors were seen by Linnaeus in the multi-hued petals of many of the species.

== Taxonomy ==
Iridaceae is currently recognized as nested in the Asparagales order but was traditionally grouped with Liliales. Iridaceae was previously divided into four subfamilies but results from phylogenetic analysis suggested an additional three could be recognized. These differences in circumscription are a result of homoplastic traits, including asymmetric corms, woody corm covering, exclusion of the vascular trace during ovule development, and leaf margin. Molecular clock analyses have supported initial cladogenesis in Antarctica-Australasia 82 mya from a Doryanthaceae ancestor. The distribution of subfamilies in Iridaceae is considered to be phylogenetically structured, with all neotropical species belonging to one subfamily, the Irdoideae.

=== Crocoideae ===
Subfamily Crocoideae is one of the major subfamilies in the family Iridaceae. It contains many genera, including &quot;Afrocrocus&quot;, &quot;Babiana&quot;, &quot;Chasmanthe&quot;, &quot;Crocosmia&quot;, &quot;Crocus&quot;, &quot;Cyanixia&quot;, &quot;Devia&quot;, &quot;Dierama&quot;, &quot;Duthiastrum&quot;, &quot;Freesia&quot;, &quot;Geissorhiza&quot;, &quot;Gladiolus&quot;, &quot;Hesperantha&quot;, &quot;Ixia&quot;, &quot;Lapeirousia&quot;, &quot;Melasphaerula&quot;, &quot;Micranthus&quot;, &quot;Pillansia&quot;, &quot;Romulea&quot;, &quot;Sparaxis&quot;, &quot;Savannosiphon&quot;, &quot;Syringodea&quot;, &quot;Thereianthus&quot;, &quot;Tritonia&quot;, &quot;Tritoniopsis&quot;, &quot;Xenoscapa&quot; and &quot;Watsonia&quot;.
They are mainly from Africa, but includes members from Europe and Asia. The rootstock is usually a corm, they have blooms which sometimes have scent, are collected in inflorescence and contain six tepals. The nectar is produced mostly in the base of the bloom from the glands of the ovary, which is where the flower forms a tube-like end. In some species there is no such end and the plant only provides pollen to pollinating insects. Members of this subfamily have the sword-shaped leaves typical of Iridaceae.

=== Isophysidoideae ===
Subfamily Isophysidoideae is monotypic, only containing &quot;Isophysis&quot; from Tasmania. It is the only member of the family with a superior ovary, and it grows a solitary star-like, yellow to brownish flower. It is also sister to all other extant taxa of Iridaceae, diverging 66mya.

=== Nivenioideae and allies ===
Subfamily Nivenioideae contained six genera from South Africa, Australia and Madagascar, including the core genera and only true shrubs in the family (&quot;Klattia&quot;, &quot;Nivenia&quot; and &quot;Witsenia&quot;). Upon phylogenetic analysis, subfamily Crocoideae is always found nested within Nivenioideae, leading to it not being a monophyletic taxon. A revised description of these groups led to the description of Aristea, Geosiris, and Patersonia each as separate subfamilies, retaining a core, monophyletic Nivenioideae. It is now distinguished as being evergreen shrubs with monocot-type secondary thickening, shield shaped seeds, and paired rhipidia with only one to two flowers in each cluster.

=== Iridoideae ===
Subfamily Iridoideae has the widest geographic distribution and is divided into four tribes and one sister genus: Irideae, Sisyrichieae, Trimezieae, Tigridieae,and Diplarreneae. Iridoideae is differentiated from the other subfamilies by having very short-lived flowers, nectaries on the perianth, and long branching styles. Excluding the Irideae, the evolution of oil-producing trichomes, called elaiophores, have been gained and lost in each of the tribes attracting oil bees. The genus Diplarreneae is sister to the rest of the subfamily and is unique to Iridoideae in having zygomorphic flowers and stamens with unequal height. Irideae represents the Old World portion of the subfamily but include several genera that diversified in North America, such as &quot;Iris&quot;. They are distinguishable with the presence of flattened anthers pressed to the style, petaloid crests, and schlerenchyma tissue along the margins of leaves. Sisyrichieae is noted for having long style branches that may interlace with stamens, partially fused filaments, and the lack of oxaloacetate crystals in leaves. Trimezieae is the smallest tribe with two to four genera, noted for the presence of large rhizomes or corms rather than bulbs as well as a thickened midrib. Several species with ornamented or iris-like flowers also possess a specialized method of forcing pollen onto heavy pollinators with hinged petals. Tigridieae are distinguished for their large bulbous rootstock and plicate, decidious leaves. The number of genera and whether any morphology can distinguish between them has been debated.

==Ecology==
Members of Iridaceae occur in a great variety of habitats. Gladiolus gueinzii occurs on the seashore just above the high tide mark within reach of the spray. Most species are adapted to seasonal climates that have a pronounced dry or cold period unfavorable for plant growth and during which the plants are dormant. As a result, most species are deciduous. Evergreen species are restricted to subtropical forests or savanna, temperate grasslands and perennially moist fynbos. A few species grow in marshes or along streams and some even grow only in the spray of seasonal waterfalls.

Members of the subfamilies Crocoideae and Nivenioideae first began cladogenesis in arid conditions in Africa, accelerating for Crocoideae as the Mediterranean climate emerged in Southern Africa. A similar process occurred for the tribe Tigridieae in Iridoideae following long-distance dispersal from South to North America, resulting in high levels of endemism. In the tribe Sisyrichieae, the continued formation of the Andes supported the movement to lower elevations along the Atlantic.

The aerial portions of deciduous species die back when the bulb or corm enters dormancy. The plants thus survive periods that are unfavorable for growth by retreating underground. This is particularly useful in grasslands and fynbos, which are adapted to regular burning in the dry season. At this time the plants are dormant and their bulbs or corms are able to survive the heat of the fires underground. Veld fires clear the soil surface of competing vegetation, as well as fertilize it with ash. With the arrival of the first rains, the dormant corms are ready to burst into growth, sending up flowers and stems before they can be shaded out by other vegetation. Many grassland and fynbos irids flower best after fires and some fynbos species will only flower in the season after a fire.

The majority of Iridaceae are pollinated by Hymenoptera, frequently by single species or a small group of species. These tight relationships found in individual species of Iridaceae, especially in &quot;Gladiolus,&quot; were the inspiration for the description of pollinator syndromes. Pollinators include various species of solitary bees, as well as sunbirds, long-proboscid flies (such as &quot;Moegistorhynchus longirostris&quot;), butterflies, and night moths. Ancestrally, flowers were zygomorphic, as in Crocoideae, with contrasting nectary locations for pollinators. Flowers may present nectar and pollen rewards to visitors, but some genera may only offer nectar such as in &quot;Gladious&quot; and &quot;Watsonia&quot;. Species of &quot;Ferraria&quot; produce putrid smells, floral cups, and dark mottled perianth in order to attract Diptera. Members of Iridoideae and Nivenioideae have radially symmetric trumpet-like flowers that secrete large amounts of nectar. This novel morphology enabled additional floral complexity and rapid evolution of pollinator relationships, as frequently as a new relationship over 5 speciations. New World Iridoideae represent one of the largest clades offering oil to pollinators, ranging from forced pollination using hinged petals to frequent failure to pollinate. Most of the variability in flowers occurs between subfamilies, including infloresence structure, i.e. rhipidia, panicle, or spike, and floral longevity, i.e. less than one day to five days. Some members of the tribe Irideae have flowers functioning as meranthia, or developing as three separate zygomorphic units that pollinators visit individually.

==List of genera==
69 genera have been recognized in the family, with a total of 2597 species described. The Afrotropical realm, and in particular South Africa, have the greatest diversity of genera.

<doc id="345331" wikidata="Q110257504" url="?curid=345331" title="Lesser whitethroat">
<text>The lesser whitethroat (Curruca curruca) is a common and widespread typical warbler which breeds in temperate Europe, except the southwest, and in the western and central Palearctic. This small passerine bird is strongly migratory, wintering in Africa just south of the Sahara, Arabia and India.

Unlike many sylviid warblers, the sexes are almost identical. This is a small species with a grey back, whitish underparts, a grey head with a darker &quot;bandit mask&quot; through the eyes and a white throat. It is slightly smaller than the common whitethroat, and lacks the chestnut wings and uniform head-face colour of that species. The lesser whitethroat&#x27;s song is a fast and rattling sequence of &quot;tet&quot; or &quot;che&quot; calls, quite different from the common whitethroat&#x27;s scolding song.

Like most &quot;warblers&quot;, it is insectivorous, but will also take berries and other soft fruit. This is a bird of fairly open country and cultivation, with large bushes for nesting and some trees. The nest is built in low shrub or brambles, and 3 to 7 eggs are laid.

==Taxonomy==
The lesser whitethroat was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Motacilla curruca&quot;. The specific &quot;curruca&quot; is the Latin word for an unidentified bird mentioned by the Roman poet Juvenal. The word had been used for the lesser whitethroat by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1555. Linnaeus specified the locality as Europe but this was restricted to Sweden by Ernst Hartert in 1909. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Curruca&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1802.

This species has been commonly assumed to be closely related to the common whitethroat, as their common names imply. It was suggested that the two species separated in the last ice age similar to the pattern found in the chiffchaff and willow warbler, with their ancestor being forced into two enclaves, one in the southeast and one in the southwest of Europe. When the ice sheets retreated, the two forms supposedly no longer recognised each other as the same species. However, scientists researching this question have for quite some time realised that these two taxa are not particularly close relatives.

Rather, the lesser whitethroat and its closest relatives Hume&#x27;s whitethroat and the small whitethroat appear more related to a group of morphologically quite dissimilar species. These vary much in size and colour pattern, but also lack chestnut wing patches and have a strong contrast between the usually dark head sides and the white or whitish throat. The latter group occurs from the southern parts of the lesser whitethroat complex&#x27; range into Africa and include the Orphean warbler group, the Arabian warbler, and the brown and Yemen warblers sometimes placed in &quot;Parisoma&quot;. Thus, it rather appears as if the divergence of the lesser whitethroat complex and its closest living relatives is more ancient than assumed, and that it did not involve separation by ice sheets building up in Europe, but by aridification of the Arabian region (which also occurred throughout the Ice Ages).

The lesser whitethroat complex has been split up into the present species, Hume&#x27;s whitethroat, and the small whitethroat from which the Margelanic whitethroat may also be specifically distinct. In this superspecies, the lesser whitethroat seems to form the basal European lineage. Six subspecies are nowadays unequivocally accepted for the lesser whitethroat, and they intergrade throughout Central Europe and Asia:

* &quot;Curruca curruca curruca&quot; – Western lesser whitethroat – western parts of range
* &quot;Curruca curruca blythi&quot; – Northeastern lesser whitethroat – eastern parts of range. Has somewhat paler top of head, separated from face sides by white supercilium.
* &quot;Curruca curruca halimodendri&quot; – SE Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan to NW Mongolia
* &quot;Curruca curruca althaea&quot; – Hume&#x27;s whitethroat – Iran, southern Turkmenistan to northern Pakistan and central Asia
* &quot;Curruca curruca minula&quot; – Desert whitethroat – southern Kazakhstan to western China
* &quot;Curruca curruca margelanica&quot; – northern China

Two more taxa occur in the intergradation zone with the small whitethroat, stretching from the northern Caspian Sea area into Mongolia. The phylogeny of these is not well-researched, and they might eventually turn out to belong to either species or be stereotyped hybrids:
* &quot;Curruca curruca/minula halimodendri&quot;
* &quot;Curruca curruca/minula telengitica&quot;

Similarly, &quot;Curruca curruca caucasica&quot; described by Ognev and Banjkovski in 1910 is intermediate between the lesser and Hume&#x27;s whitethroats.

A bird which wintered at Landsort Bird Observatory, Sweden, differed in the analyzed mtDNA sequences from all known taxa in the complex, although it most closely resembled &quot;halimodendri&quot; in the field. As mtDNA is inherited from the mother only, were this bird a hybrid this should have been recognisable.

<text>Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG - Temps-coordonnée géocentrique) is a coordinate time standard intended to be used as the independent variable of time for all calculations pertaining to precession, nutation, the Moon, and artificial satellites of the Earth. It is equivalent to the proper time experienced by a clock at rest in a coordinate frame co-moving with the center of the Earth : that is, a clock that performs exactly the same movements as the Earth but is outside the Earth&#x27;s gravity well. It is therefore not influenced by the gravitational time dilation caused by the Earth. The TCG is the time coordinate for the  Geocentric Celestial Reference System (GCRS).

TCG was defined in 1991 by the International Astronomical Union. Unlike former astronomical time scales, TCG is defined in the context of the general theory of relativity. The relationships between TCG and other relativistic time scales are defined with fully general relativistic metrics.

Because the reference frame for TCG is not rotating with the surface of the Earth and not in the gravitational potential of the Earth, TCG ticks faster than clocks on the surface of the Earth by a factor of about 7.0 × 10−10 (about 22 milliseconds per year). Consequently, the values of physical constants to be used with calculations using TCG differ from the traditional values of physical constants. (The traditional values were in a sense wrong, incorporating corrections for the difference in time scales.) Adapting the large body of existing software to change from TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time) to TCG is a formidable task, and as of 2002 many calculations continue to use TDB in some form.

Time coordinates on the TCG scale are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used. For continuity with its predecessor Ephemeris Time, TCG was set to match ET at around Julian Date 2443144.5 (1977-01-01T00Z). More precisely, it was defined that TCG instant 1977-01-01T00:00:32.184 exactly corresponds to TAI instant 1977-01-01T00:00:00.000 exactly. This is also the instant at which TAI introduced corrections for gravitational time dilation.

TCG is a Platonic time scale: a theoretical ideal, not dependent on a particular realisation. For practical purposes, TCG must be realised by actual clocks in the Earth system. Because of the linear relationship between Terrestrial Time (TT) and TCG, the same clocks that realise TT also serve for TCG. See the article on TT for details of the relationship and how TT is realised.

Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB) is the analog of TCG, used for calculations relating to the Solar System beyond Earth orbit. TCG is defined by a different reference frame from TCB, such that they are not linearly related. Over the long term, TCG ticks more slowly than TCB by about 1.6 × 10−8 (about 0.5 seconds per year). In addition there are periodic variations, as Earth moves within the Solar System. When the Earth is at perihelion in January, TCG ticks even more slowly than it does on average, due to gravitational time dilation from being deeper in the Sun&#x27;s gravity well and also velocity time dilation from moving faster relative to the Sun. At aphelion in July the opposite holds, with TCG ticking faster than it does on average.

<text>The Dartford warbler (Curruca undata) is a typical warbler from the warmer parts of western Europe and northwestern Africa. It is a small warbler with a long thin tail and a thin pointed bill. The adult male has grey-brown upperparts and is dull reddish-brown below except for the centre of the belly which has a dirty white patch. It has light speckles on the throat and a red eye-ring. The sexes are similar but the adult female is usually less grey above and paler below.

Its breeding range lies west of a line from southern England to the heel of Italy (southern Apulia). The Dartford warbler is usually resident all year in its breeding range, but there is some limited migration.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Dartford warbler was first described in 1776 by the Welsh naturalist, Thomas Pennant. He introduced the English name and based his description on two specimens that had been obtained by the ornithologist John Latham from Bexley Heath, near Dartford in Kent. In 1783 Latham included the warbler in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot; but did not coin the binomial name, &quot;Sylvia dartfordiensis&quot;, until the supplement to his work was published in 1787. However, in 1783, before the publication of Latham&#x27;s supplement, the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert introduced the name, &quot;Motacilla undata&quot;, based on a coloured plate of &quot;Le Pitte-chou, de Provence&quot; in Edmé-Louis Daubenton&#x27;s &quot;Planches enluminées d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;undata&quot; is from Medieval Latin &quot;undatus&quot; meaning &quot;with wavy markings&quot;. The type locality is Provence in France.

This species probably forms a superspecies with Tristram&#x27;s warbler and this in turn seems close to Marmora&#x27;s warbler and the Balearic warbler. Altogether, this group of typical warblers bears a resemblance to the wrentit, the only species of Sylviidae from the Americas. However, the wrentit is less closely related to the genus &quot;Sylvia&quot; than to the parrotbills. Its visual similarity to the Dartford warbler group is an example of convergent evolution.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. u. dartfordiensis&quot; (Latham, 1787) – south England and north-west France
* &quot;C. u. toni&quot; (Hartert, 1909) – north-west Africa
* &quot;C. u. undata&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – Iberian Peninsula and south France

==Description==
The Dartford warbler is a small, , passerine bird, distinguished by its long tail compared with that of other warblers. Its plumage comprises unobtrusive and muted tones, which blend in with the dry dead plants, old wood or sunny greyish wood found in its preferred habitats.

Like many typical warblers, the Dartford warbler has distinct male and female plumages. The male has a grey back and head, reddish underparts, and a red eye. The reddish throat is spotted with white. The sides are a dull greyish tone, being more clear about the abdomen. In some populations males have bluish-grey or brownish-grey backs and heads. The female is paler below, especially on the throat, and a browner grey above. The female&#x27;s throat also has white spots, although they are smaller and less marked than in the male. Juvenile birds are similar to females.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is naturally rare. The largest European populations of &quot;Curruca undata&quot; are in the Iberian peninsula, others in much of France, in Italy and southern England and south Wales. In Africa it can be found only in small areas in the north, wintering in northern Morocco and northern Algeria.

==Behaviour and ecology==


===Breeding===
Dartford warblers first breed when they are one year old. They are usually monogamous and the pair bond can persist from one year to the next. The male sometimes builds several simple nests (cock nests) of which one is chosen by the female, but it is more usual for both birds to participate in constructing the breeding nest. In southern England the birds breed on heathlands, sometimes near the coast, and nest in either common gorse (&quot;Ulex europaeus&quot;) or common heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;). The compact cup-shaped nest is located in dense bushes, usually within of the ground. It is formed mainly of grasses and is lined with a layer of finer material that can include thin roots and feathers. The eggs are laid from early April in southern France and Spain, and from mid-April in southern England. The clutch is typically 3–5 eggs which are smooth and glossy, with a white or occasionally pale green ground and marked with brown speckles which are sometimes concentrated at the larger end. The average size of an egg is with a weight of of which 6 percent is shell. The eggs are incubated for 12–14 days mainly by the female. The chicks are fed arthropods by both parents. The nestlings fledge 10–14 days after hatching and are then fed by their parents for a further two weeks. Usually two and occasionally three broods are raised in a year.

===Feeding===
It inhabits open fields with degraded scrub brush and is common in heather. In winter it may visit urban areas, but always feeds within shrubs in these areas. It nests in bushes with thorns and near the ground. These warblers are mostly insectivorous, eating caterpillars, butterflies, beetles and spiders.

The song of the Dartford warbler is a distinctive rattling warble.

==Status and conservation==

Dartford warblers almost died out in the United Kingdom in the severe winter of 1962/1963 when the national population dropped to just ten pairs. &quot;Sylvia undata&quot; is also sensitive to drought affecting breeding success or producing heath fires, as occurred during 1975 and 1976 in England when virtually all juveniles failed to survive their first year.

However, this species can recover well in good quality habitat with favourable temperatures and rainfall, thanks to repeated nesting and a high survival rate for the young. Indeed, they recovered in some areas of the UK, but numbers are once again on the decline in other regions of their natural range.

The range of the Dartford warbler is restricted to western and southern Europe. The total population in 2012 was estimated at 1.1–2.5 million breeding pairs. The largest numbers occur in Spain where there were believed to be 983,000–1,750,000 pairs. For reasons that probably include loss of suitable habitat, the Spanish population appears to be declining. The species is therefore classed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being Near Threatened.

A period of climatic warming since 1963 has seen the UK population increase to &quot;more than 2,500 pairs in 2006 (Wotton et al. 2009). Expansion into patches of structurally suitable habitat (up to an altitude of 400m), more northerly areas and away from the core of the range, from Dorset and Hampshire to Derbyshire and Suffolk, is likely to have been facilitated by milder winter weather (Wotton et al. 2009, Bradbury et al. 2011). The Dartford warbler population in the UK is expected to continue to increase. However, future climate-based projections for the European range indicate that by 2080, more than 60% of the current European range may no longer be suitable (Huntley et al 2007). There is evidence that this is happening already, with severe declines in Spain and France (Green 2017). For this reason, the species is classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Global Red List. If the declines in southern Europe continue, the UK will become increasingly important for global conservation of this species&quot;.

<text>This is a list of montes (mountains, singular &quot;mons&quot;) on the planet Venus. Venusian mountains are all named after goddesses in the mythologies of various cultures, except for the Maxwell Montes.

The four main mountain ranges of Venus are named Akna Montes, Danu Montes, Freyja Montes, and Maxwell Montes. These are found on Ishtar Terra.

Mountain ranges are formed by the folding and buckling of a planet&#x27;s crust. The mountain ranges of Venus, like those of the Earth, are characterized by many parallel folds and faults.

The presence of mountain ranges on Venus may provide evidence that the planet&#x27;s surface is in motion.

<doc id="345352" wikidata="Q454058" url="?curid=345352" title="Hélio Castroneves">
<text>Hélio Castroneves (; born Hélio Alves de Castro Neves; 10 May 1975) is a Brazilian auto racing driver. He competes part-time in the IndyCar Series, driving the No. 06 Dallara-Honda for Meyer Shank Racing. He is one of four drivers to have won the Indianapolis 500 a record four times: in 2001, 2002, 2009, and 2021. He was runner-up in the IndyCar Series drivers&#x27; championship in 2002, 2008, 2013, and 2014. Castroneves has also competed in the IMSA SportsCar Championship, where he won the overall championship in 2020 with Team Penske. He is a three-time winner of the 24 Hours of Daytona, consecutively in 2021 with Wayne Taylor Racing and 2022 and 2023 with Meyer Shank, and won Petit Le Mans two times.

Castroneves began competitive go-karting at age 10, before progressing to car racing, in the Formula Chevrolet Brazil, Formula 3 Sudamericana, the British Formula Three Championship, and Indy Lights. He entered Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) in 1998 with Bettenhausen Racing and with Hogan Racing in 1999, achieving one second place each with both teams. Castroneves moved to Team Penske in place of Greg Moore for 2000 and 2001, winning three races in both years.

He debuted in the Indy Racing League (IRL) in 2001, competing in two races for Penske and winning the Indianapolis 500. Castroneves drove full time in the IRL from 2002, winning the Indy 500 for a second straight year and finishing runner-up to Sam Hornish Jr. in the championship. He finished third in 2003 and 2006 and was runner-up to Scott Dixon in 2008. During the 2009 season, he won the Indianapolis 500 for the third time and finished fourth in the points standings. He was fourth again in two of the next three seasons, before coming second to Dixon in 2013 and his Penske teammate Will Power in 2014. Castroneves achieved one further series win in 2017 before leaving full-time IndyCar racing to make his IMSA SportsCar Championship debut with Penske at the 2017 Petit Le Mans, paired with Ricky Taylor. He won one race and finished seventh in the 2018 Prototype standings and improved to third with five podiums in 2019. In 2020, he would win four races en route to his first auto racing title.

One of the most popular drivers in IndyCar, his celebration of climbing the fencing beside the track after a victory, would earn him the nickname &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. Castroneves has represented IndyCar in the International Race of Champions series, the Race of Champions event, and the Superstar Racing Experience. Among other media appearances, Castroneves won the fifth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with professional dancer Julianne Hough.

==Early and personal life==
Castroneves was born in São Paulo, Brazil on 10 May 1975, to automobile dealer Hélio Castro Neves and former school teacher Sandra Alves de Castro Neves. He has an elder sister, Katiucia, who is his business manager. In 1977, the family moved to Ribeirão Preto, an agricultural town about northwest of São Paulo, to allow his father to find business in the region&#x27;s thriving ethanol processing industry. He was educated in the São Paulo school system. In 2000, he changed his surname from Castro Neves to Castroneves to stop the media misidentifying him as &quot;Helio Neves&quot; or &quot;Helio Castro&quot;. Castroneves has a daughter with his long-time partner Adriana Henao.

==Karting career==
From early 1981 to 1986, Castroneves observed his father&#x27;s minor stock car team race on weekends by being sneaked into a car&#x27;s trunk in racing overalls and helmet, allowing him into a circuit. At age seven, he was given a child-sized motorized car for frequent driving on the streets of his gated community and asked his father about a go-kart. On his 11th birthday, Castroneves received his first go-kart from race car driver Alfredo Guaraná Menezes, and began driving at a karting track in São Paulo. His mother disliked racing, urging him to focus on schooling and enrolling him in less dangerous sports, such as association football, judo, swimming, tennis, and volleyball. Castroneves played those sports infrequently before telling his mother he wanted to focus on racing. He was inspired by Ayrton Senna, a three-time Formula One world champion.

His father enrolled him in the Karting State Championships in São Paulo in early 1987. Castroneves won his first trophy mid-year by bettering himself, as his father sold his Rio de Janeiro property to establish and finance a karting team around his son. At age 13, he was taken off full-time schooling to learn more about karting from his father and team members. Castroneves&#x27; mother disapproved because she believed he could opt to stop karting and was fearful of him not having a backup career. Castroneves won the 1989 Brazilian National Go-Kart Championship at age 14. Around this time, he and his family began watching Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) and Formula One racing on television. From October 1989 to March 1990, Castroneves did weightlifting and played tennis to improve his physique.

In 1990, he forfeited the Brazilian National Go-Kart Championship and flew to Italy to enter the Karting World Cup to acquaint himself with the more powerful and grippier European go-karts. A mix-up of his registration papers with the Confederação Brasileira de Automobilismo (English: Brazilian Autosport Confederation) and talks with the Commission Internationale de Karting in Switzerland prevented him from entering until a fellow karter sustained an arm injury. Castroneves finished the race 16th. He raced in the 1991 Karting World Cup in France without registration trouble, finishing 25th, and won more races in Brazil.

==Junior car racing career==
Aged 16 in late 1991, Castroneves progressed into car racing, competing in Formula Chevrolet Brazil, a series for finishing go-karters. His parents hired a trainer to help him lift weights for better car control and took him to a local recreational center. Negotiations to drive for the Arisco team fell through when it asked for $200,000 in sponsorship, causing his father to spend $250,000 on his team. Driving a Copral-Berta-Chevrolet car, Castroneves was championship runner-up with one victory and 92 points in the eight-round season. He moved to the higher-tier Formula 3 (F3) Sudamericana in 1993 driving a Ralt RT34-Mugen Honda car with Copral and later the funded Amir Nasr Racing Team. Castroneves&#x27; five-year-old car was worn and had no aerial to communicate to his team by radio. He was championship runner-up to Argentinean driver Fernando Croceri with four victories, eight podium finishes and 57 points.

Castroneves progressed to the Brazilian Formula Three Championship in 1994 with the Amir Nasr Racing Team, finishing second overall with three victories, four pole positions and 52 points from eight races. For 1995, Castroneves drove a Dallara F395-Mugen Honda car for Paul Stewart Racing in the British Formula Three Championship. His father obtained sponsorship from a Brazilian bank, and mid-way through 1995, sold his business assets, private company and Katicia&#x27;s university apartment to help finance his son&#x27;s career. Castroneves was third in the drivers&#x27; championship with 169 points, six podiums and a win at Donington Park. He finished third in the Masters of Formula 3 at Circuit Zandvoort and crashed out of the Macau Grand Prix.

In November 1995, a Philip Morris International executive asked Castroneves whether he wanted to enter a four-day Indy Lights (CART&#x27;s developmental series) test session at Phoenix International Raceway&#x27;s oval track against nine other drivers. Although he did not finish the test due to exhaustion, he signed to drive Tasman Motorsports&#x27; third car with partial funding from the team and the rest from a corporate sponsor after another year in F3 was financially unfeasible. Driving the 8 Lola T93/20-Buick car in the 1996 season, Castroneves won at Circuit Trois-Rivières and achieved seven top-tens for seventh overall with 84 points. A series of accidents and Castroneves&#x27; lack of English frustrated him, and he briefly spoke to a sports psychologist for help mid-season.

For the 1997 season, he remained at Tasman Motorsport, but was told his sponsor was leaving, forcing Katicia to promote him to several Brazilian companies. He and team owner Steve Horne agreed if he won five races, Horne would retain all prize monies until Castroneves paid him what he was owed, effectively driving for free. Driving the No. 29 Lola T97/20-Buick car, Castroneves was championship runner-up to teammate Tony Kanaan, winning three of the twelve races, six top tens, four pole positions, and 152 points. On 11 June 1997, the two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Emerson Fittipaldi became Castroneves&#x27; manager and sponsorship finder.

==CART==
===1998–1999===

In January 1998, Bettenhausen Racing owner Tony Bettenhausen Jr. invited him to test for his CART team at Sebring International Raceway; Castroneves signed to drive its No. 16 Reynard 98I-Mercedes-Benz car in the 1998 season, and was assigned former Penske Racing employee Tom Brown as his race engineer. During practice for the season-opening Grand Prix of Miami at Homestead–Miami Speedway, Castroneves sustained a sore head in an accident but medical officials cleared him to race. Castroneves achieved his first career top-ten finish in CART, a ninth at the Grand Prix of Long Beach, followed by a season-high second in the Miller 200 at Milwaukee Mile. He was 17th in the drivers&#x27; championship with 36 points, and was second to Kanaan in the Rookie of the Year standings.

In mid-1998 Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR) wanted Castroneves to replace the Formula One-bound Alex Zanardi; Team Rahal were also interested in him. Fittipaldi blocked both deals as he felt Mercedes-Benz was CART&#x27;s best engine. Bettenhausen Racing fired Castroneves in January 1999, and replaced him with the sponsored Shigeaki Hattori. Castroneves agreed with team owner Carl Hogan on 26 January to drive for Hogan Racing in 1999 in place of JJ Lehto on the condition he paid $3 million in sponsorship to the team. He drove the unreliable No. 9 Lola B99/00-Mercedes-Benz car with an engine inconsistent in producing power. Castroneves was ninth in the Firestone Firehawk 500K at Twin Ring Motegi, before coming second in the Motorola 300 at Gateway International Raceway. In the Miller Lite 225 at Milwaukee, Castroneves achieved his first CART pole position. The rest of the season saw him achieve four more top-tens and finished 15th in the points standings with 48.

===2000–2001===
Post-season, Hogan closed his CART team because Fittipaldi was unable to provide him with the requested sponsorship money and consequently, stopped paying Castroneves a salary. Castroneves and his sister negotiated without Fittipaldi&#x27;s help with Walker Racing to replace the outgoing Gil de Ferran and also Team Rahal without success. Following Greg Moore&#x27;s death in an accident at the season-ending Marlboro 500 at California Speedway, Penske owner Roger Penske, team president Tim Cindric, attorneys, and sports agent Alan Miller hired Castroneves on a three-year contract for Castroneves after pressure from sponsor Marlboro to find a replacement driver by that date. Castroneves ended his working relationship with Fittipaldi soon after for career mismanagement.

For the 2000 season, Penske stopped building cars, switched to a Reynard 2KI, changed engine manufacturers from Mercedes-Benz to Honda, and tire supplier from Goodyear to Firestone in a bid to improve performance. Castroneves found the Honda engine&#x27;s driveability different from Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s, and was at first, not friends with his teammate de Ferran because they were competitors. He finished second at the Grand Prix of Long Beach, his only points finish in the first six races. He led the final 24 laps of the Grand Prix of Detroit in his first series victory after Juan Pablo Montoya retired with mechanical trouble. Castroneves won the Miller Lite 200 at Mid-Ohio, took five top-tens, and a third victory in the Grand Prix of Monterey at Laguna Seca. He was seventh in the drivers&#x27; championship with 129 points, and was named the inaugural winner of the Greg Moore Legacy Award as &quot;the driver who best typifies Moore&#x27;s outstanding talent on the track as well as displaying a dynamic personality with the fans, media, and the CART community.&quot;

In 2001, he drove the No. 3 Reynard 01I-Honda, and journalist David Phillips considered him a championship contender. Castroneves changed his strategy on a race-by-race basis, getting support from de Ferran and his teammate&#x27;s pit crew. At the season&#x27;s second race, the Grand Prix of Long Beach, he led all 82 laps from pole position for his fourth career win. Castroneves started from pole position in the Firestone Firehawk 500 at Motegi, leading more laps than any other driver to finish second, and led every lap of the Grand Prix of Detroit for his second victory of 2001. He achieved a third win at the Miller Lite 200 to go one point behind championship leader Kenny Bräck, and overtook the latter after finishing seventh in the Motorola 220. Castroneves lost the points lead after coming 18th in Indy Vancouver, but claimed three top sixes in the final six races to finish fourth in the drivers&#x27; standings with 141 points.

==IndyCar Series==
===2001–2004===

He debuted in the Indy Racing League (IRL) in 2001, driving Penske&#x27;s No. 68 Dallara IR-01-Oldsmobile car, at the season-opening Pennzoil Copper World Indy 200 at Phoenix to understand the series before the Indianapolis 500. Castroneves started 17th but retired with engine failure after three-quarters race distance. He qualified 11th for his first Indianapolis 500 and led the final 52 laps to win the race at his first attempt.

Castroneves switched to the IRL from the 2002 season since Marlboro wanted Penske to focus on the American market. Penske changed engine manufacturers from Oldsmobile to Chevrolet for its Dallara IR-02 car. At Phoenix for the season&#x27;s second race, he won from pole position after passing his teammate de Ferran on the 183rd lap. Castroneves&#x27; season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, which he won in controversial circumstances. With one-and-a-half laps remaining, CART driver Paul Tracy overtook Castroneves for the lead, just as the yellow caution flag light came on for a two-car accident between Buddy Lazier and Laurent Redon. IRL officials&#x27; rejected an appeal from Tracy&#x27;s squad Team Green, upholding Castroneves&#x27; second successive Indianapolis 500 victory. He finished no lower than ninth in the next nine races, battling his teammate De Ferran and Panther Racing&#x27;s Sam Hornish Jr. for the championship. Before the final round at Texas Motor Speedway Castroneves was 12 points behind Hornish and needed to win the race and for Hornish to finish third or lower to claim the championship. He finished second, 0.010 seconds behind Hornish, ending the season runner-up with 511 points.

Before the 2003 season, Penske allowed Castroneves to test for the Toyota Formula One team at Circuit Paul Ricard in France before possible contract renewal. He impressed Toyota with his performance but was told CART champion Cristiano da Matta signed as a race driver for 2003. Castroneves told Penske he would stay with the team, citing his fair and loyal treatment towards him. The beginning of the season saw Castroneves earn two top threes in Homestead-Miami, Phoenix, and the Indianapolis 500. Castroneves took two straight second places at Richmond International Raceway and Kansas Speedway and won at Gateway International Raceway and Nazareth Speedway to take the points to lead. A gearbox failure at Chicagoland Speedway leaving him 20th and a sixth in California meant he entered the season-ending Chevy 500 at Texas as one of five championship contenders and equal on points with CGR&#x27;s Scott Dixon. A minor collision with Tony Kanaan took Castroneves out of title contention. He was third in points with 484 scored.

For the 2004 season, Hornish joined Castroneves at Penske after De Ferran retired from IndyCar; at first, the two did not speak to each other often because of their differing personalities. He led most of the season-opening Toyota Indy 300 before Hornish passed him on the final lap to win. Castroneves qualified eighth for his fourth Indianapolis 500. A lack of horsepower against the Honda-powered cars caused him to finish the rain-shortened race ninth. Two races later, Castroneves&#x27; first pole position of the season came in the SunTrust Indy Challenge at Richmond, where he finished third. He took eight more top tens, four pole positions, and overtook Andretti Green Racing&#x27;s Dan Wheldon to lead the final 21 laps of the season-ending race at Texas for his only win of 2004. Castroneves&#x27; finished fourth in the drivers&#x27; championship with 440 points.

===2005–2008 ===
Penske&#x27;s performance in 2004 saw Castroneves being viewed as an outsider for the 2005 title. He began the season with a fifth place in the Toyota Indy 300 and a second at the following XM Satellite Radio 200. Starting the Indianapolis 500 from fifth position, Castroneves finished the race four places lower in ninth. At Richmond for the SunTrust Indy Challenge two races later, he qualified second and led a race-high 112 laps to win. The relationship between Castroneves and his teammate Hornish cooled after failed overtakes causing both drivers to collide. He qualified on the pole position at Pikes Peak International Raceway and Watkins Glen International and took six top-tens in the final ten races, finishing with 440 points for sixth in the drivers&#x27; championship.

Before the 2006 season, Penske changed engine manufacturers from the under-powered Toyota to the more powerful Honda in its Dallara IR-05 car after Toyota withdrew from IndyCar. Castroneves started fifth and led 40 laps for his first series road course win in the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg. He took a second successive victory at Motegi, leading 184 laps from pole position to lead Wheldon by 42 championship points entering the Indianapolis 500. After qualifying second, handling difficulties caused him to strike the turn four concrete barrier, leaving him 25th after 109 laps. Castroneves won the Bombardier LearJet 500 after strategic errors by his teammate Hornish and CGR before tire problems at Kansas and a sixth place at Kansas lost him the points lead to Hornish. A victory at Michigan International Speedway gave Castroneves a one-point lead over Hornish going into the final race in Chicago. A fourth-place put him third in points with 473.

For the 2007 season, Castroneves believed the competition would be stronger than in 2006. The relationship between him and Hornish became cordial and the two shared information. He began the year with four top nines, leading 95 laps from pole position to win the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg. He took his third career Indianapolis 500 pole position, finishing the rain-shortened race third after pre-race electrical and fueling problems. At the ABC Supply Company A.J. Foyt 225 at Milwaukee a week later, he took his third pole position of 2007, but a rear wing mounting failure on lap 201 caused him to crash while leading. Castroneves took six top-nines, and three more pole positions in the final ten races for sixth overall in points with 446.

Castroneves began the 2008 season by finishing no lower than fourth in the first four rounds with consecutive second places at St. Petersburg and Motegi to take the early points lead. He qualified fourth for the Indianapolis 500; Castroneves lost the points lead to Dixon when front wing damage relegated him to fourth. He finished second in both Texas and Richmond with consecutive pole positions at Nashville and Mid-Ohio, both of which did not result in a race victory. Castroneves won the Peak Antifreeze Indy Grand Prix at Infineon Raceway leading a race-high 51 laps from pole position to end a 29-race winless streak. After finishing second in Detroit for illegally blocking Justin Wilson, he entered the season-ending Peak Antifreeze Indy 300 30 points behind championship leader Dixon. Castroneves needed to win the race and for Dixon to finish 11th or lower to become the champion. He began in 28th due to a track limit penalty, beating Dixon by 0.0033 seconds in the second-closest finish in series history, ending the season second in points with 629.

===Tax evasion trial===
In late 2008, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) jury charged Castroneves with conspiracy and six counts of tax evasion for failing to report $5.5 million of income earned from 1999 to 2004. The issue came about when Alan Miller signed Castroneves to his first contract with Penske in early November 1999 following Greg Moore&#x27;s sudden death at the 1999 Marlboro 500. With heavy pressure from sponsors to fill Moore&#x27;s vacant seat, the deal had to be completed in a matter of days. Due to time constraints, Miller rushed through the contract negotiations for Penske, simply striking out Moore&#x27;s name on the contract documents, and hand-writing in Castroneves&#x27; name. He also struck out the name of Moore&#x27;s promotion company (Greg Moore Enterprises, which Moore owned) and wrote in Seven Promotions, erroneously implying and identifying Castroneves as owning that company. Castroneves, who had been investigated by the IRS since 2004 when it issued 150 subpoenas to businesses and individuals who did business with him, pleaded not guilty to the charges on 3 October, and was ordered released on a $10 million bail. The IRS said he owed them $2.3 million in taxes. The trial was held in March 2009 at the U.S. District Court in Miami. A guilty verdict in the trial would have likely sent Castroneves to prison, and ended his driving career.

During the trial, his indictment centered around whether he used Seven Promotions as a tax shelter to avoid paying U.S. taxes. The defense claimed Seven Promotions was a Panamanian company created by Castroneves&#x27; father (Helio Sr.) in early 1999 to improve his son&#x27;s image in Brazil and to recruit sponsors. Prosecutors called that a lie, showing jurors documents claiming Castroneves owned Seven Productions, and that it was merely a shell corporation set up to obscure taxable income. An IRS agent testified Castroneves owed every amount of taxable income despite the driver not receiving any of it. The defense argued Castroneves focused on racing rather than his income; he was unaware of his finances and disliked Dutch and Panamanian business dealings. They said he was uninterested and could not understand his finances and signed papers without knowing their meaning. They also affirmed that the listing of Castroneves as the owner of Seven Promotions in the original Penske contract was a &#x27;clerical error&#x27;, and that other holes were later discovered in the contract, a result of haphazardly rushing through the negotiations.

The trial ended with closing arguments on 10 April 2009. If found guilty, he faced a maximum prison sentence of 6 years with subsequent deportation because he was a non-American citizen, and the loss of his contracts with companies he endorsed and with Team Penske. The jury deliberated until 17 April, when it acquitted Castroneves of the six counts of criminal tax evasion but hung on the conspiracy charge. On 22 May, with Castroneves at Indianapolis and back to driving, prosecutors dropped the remaining criminal conspiracy charge. A few months later, Castroneves and his attorneys hand-delivered a check to the IRS for back taxes owed, seemingly closing the issue once and for all. About two years later, the IRS filed a $6.21 million civil lawsuit against Castroneves for additional taxes and fraud penalties. The suit was settled before going to court for approximately 10 percent of what the IRS claimed.

===2009–2013===

Castroneves signed a multi-year contract with Penske from the 2009 season; Will Power replaced him for the season-opening St. Petersburg race before Castroneves returned for the Grand Prix of Long Beach. Castroneves&#x27; season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, where he qualified fastest, and led twice for a total of 66 laps for his third victory there. In the Bombardier Learjet 550 at Texas two races later, Castroneves achieved his second victory of 2009. He took six more top-tens, including a second place in the Edmonton Indy, and pole position in the Iowa Corn Indy 250 at Iowa Speedway. Castroneves was eliminated from championship contention at Chicago, and finished fourth overall with 433 points.

For the 2010 season, he felt Penske had reached the potential of its ageing Dallara-Honda car, and feared other teams would exploit this to close the performance gap. Castroneves won the inaugural Indy Grand Prix of Alabama to extend his record of winning a race to ten straight seasons. After qualifying on pole position for the Indianapolis 500, a stall in a pit stop relegated him to ninth. Five races later, at the Honda Indy Edmonton, Castroneves was the first to finish, but was demoted to tenth after he was deemed to have blocked his teammate Power. He won two consecutive races, at Kentucky Speedway and Motegi, before ending the season with a fifth at Homestead-Miami. With 531 points, Castroneves was fourth in the drivers&#x27; standings.

The beginning of the 2011 season saw him struggle in comparison with his previous years at Penske. Castroneves finished poorly as a result of three collisions in the first four races in St. Petersburg, Long Beach and São Paulo; his best result in that period was a seventh at Birmingham, putting him 17th overall by the time of the Indianapolis 500 in May. Castroneves qualified 16th for the race; a flat tire and vibration left him one lap down in 17th. The rest of Castroneves&#x27; season included two-second places at Edmonton and Sonoma, and three top-nines. He was 11th overall with 312 points, his lowest finish since he was sixth in both 2005 and 2007. The 2011 season was the first since 1999 in which Castroneves did not achieve a race win.

He began the 2020 Indianapolis 500 from 27th and finished the race in 11th.

Castroneves signed to race for Arrow McLaren SP in place of the unfit Oliver Askew at the Harvest Grand Prix in his first IndyCar start for a team other than Penske since 1999. He finished 20th in the first race and 21st in the second. Following an approach by team owner Michael Shank in late 2020, Castroneves signed for the small Meyer Shank Racing (MSR) team to compete at six races in the 2021 season, feeling the growing team would give him the opportunity to win a fourth Indianapolis 500. He had asked MSR to enter him in more races but the request was denied. At the Indianapolis 500, Castroneves achieved his record-tying fourth career victory in the event after a late-race pass on Álex Palou. He struggled with his form after his victory, and he went on to score one more top ten finish at Nashville in his final five races of 2021 to finish 22nd overall with 158 points.

In July 2021 he signed a contract extension with MSR to drive for the whole of the 2022 season – his first full-time season for five years. Castroneves achieved a season-best result of seventh at the Indianapolis 500 and scored two other top-ten finishes at Long Beach and Mid-Ohio in placing 18th overall with 263 points accumulated, which was his least successful full-time IndyCar season in his career and he did not finish on the podium over a whole year for the first time in his career. In August 2022, he signed a one-year contract extension to remain at MSR for the 2023 championship. During the season, Castroneves finished in the top ten once at Texas, the season&#x27;s second round, and scored 217 points for 18th in the championship standings.

Castroneves stopped full-time IndyCar racing at the start of the 2024 season, having become a minority partner in MSR&#x27;s ownership group and a driver coach. He was replaced by IMSA driver Tom Blomqvist but was set to continue to compete in just the Indianapolis 500 in MSR&#x27;s third car. Castroneves qualified and finished the Indianapolis 500 in 20th. He replaced Blomqvist in the No. 66 car for the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix and the following XPEL Grand Prix at Road America after Blomqvist under performed relative to teammate Rosenqvist. Castroneves finished 25th in Detroit and 19th at Road America.

==Sports car career==

Castroneves made his endurance racing debut in the 2006 Mil Milhas Brasil, winning after 374 laps in a shared GTP1-class Aston Martin DBR9 with Nelson Piquet, Nelson Piquet Jr., and Christophe Bouchut. He entered at the 2007 24 Hours of Daytona (part of the Rolex Sports Car Series), sharing Michael Shank Racing&#x27;s No. 60 Riley Daytona Prototype (DP) car with Hornish, Oswaldo Negri Jr. and Mark Patterson and finishing ninth. Two months later, Castroneves drove the No. 7 Penske Porsche RS Spyder Evo car with Timo Bernhard and Romain Dumas in the Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) category of the 12 Hours of Sebring (part of the American Le Mans Series), finishing third in class and fifth overall. He returned to the Rolex Sports Car Series to share the No. 9 Penske-Taylor Racing Riley DP car with Ryan Briscoe and Kurt Busch in the 2008 24 Hours of Daytona. finishing 13th after starting third. For the 2008 Petit Le Mans and the following 2008 Monterey Sports Car Championships Castroneves shared Penske&#x27;s No. 5 Porsche RS Spyder Evo car with Briscoe, winning the LMP2 category at Petit Le Mans.

In 2016, Roger Penske asked Castroneves if he wanted a full time sports car career. Although Castroneves wanted to remain in IndyCar, he solicited advice from Indianapolis 500 winner Rick Mears because he had doubts about staying at Penske. Mears told Castroneves to remain at Penske because of Roger Penske&#x27;s personality. Talks with several teams came close to employment but Castroneves decided to remain with Penske out of loyalty. To prepare for the 2018 IMSA SportsCar Championship in an Acura ARX-05 car in the Daytona Prototype International (DPi) category, he drove the final race of the 2017 season, the Petit Le Mans. Teamed with Montoya and Simon Pagenaud, he qualified the No. 6 Oreca 07-Gibson LMP2 car on pole position, finishing the race third after a collision with Matteo Cressoni&#x27;s Ferrari.

He formally joined Penske&#x27;s 2018 IMSA program in October 2017. Castroneves was joined by Ricky Taylor for the entire season, and by Graham Rahal for the 24 Hours of Daytona, the 12 Hours of Sebring and Petit Le Mans. He referenced his teammates Dane Cameron and Montoya, and communicated constantly with his race engineer and Taylor. Their car started second for the Daytona race, and finished ninth, after Castroneves and Action Express Racing&#x27;s Felipe Nasr collided in the 16th hour. After starting third at Sebring, he retired after six hours with a loss of oil pressure. In the Acura Sports Car Challenge at Mid-Ohio he and Taylor led 87 laps from pole for his first series victory. The final six races saw him achieve four top tens and finish second in the Chevrolet Sports Car Classic at Detroit. Castroneves was seventh in the Prototype drivers&#x27; standings with 243 points and was third in the North American Endurance Cup.

For the 2019 season, he remained at Penske in the new DPi class. He again partnered Taylor in the No. 7 car, joined by Rossi at the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring and Rahal in the season-ending Petit Le Mans. Castroneves and his co-drivers finished the rain-shortened Daytona season-opener third from starting second. A fourth place at Sebring and a second in the following BUBBA Burger Sports Car Grand Prix at Long Beach moved him and Taylor to a season-high second in the DPi standings. The rest of the season saw Castroneves and Taylor achieve two third places in the Chevrolet Sports Car Classic and the Petit Le Mans and a second place in the Monterey Grand Prix at Laguna Seca. With 284 points, he finished third in the DPi standings and was joint fifth with Oliver Jarvis and Tristan Nunez of Mazda Team Joest in the North American Endurance Cup.

Castroneves remained at Penske&#x27;s IMSA program in 2020. He was again teamed with Taylor in the No. 7 vehicle, with Rossi joining them for the endurance races. Castroneves&#x27; team was comprised in the fourth hour of the season-opening 24 Hours of Daytona following a collision with Harry Tincknell restricting them to finishing 22 laps down in eighth. He won consecutive races in the rain-affected Road Race Showcase at Road America from pole position, the Grand Prix of Road Atlanta, and the Sports Car Challenge at Mid-Ohio. Castroneves and Taylor won the championship at the season-ending 12 Hours of Sebring, his first in auto racing, by one point over Briscoe and Renger van der Zande.

In the 2021 IMSA SportsCar Championship, he won the 2021 24 Hours of Daytona as an endurance driver, sharing the No. 10 Wayne Taylor Racing Acura ARX-05 car with Filipe Albuquerque, Rossi and Taylor. Castroneves replaced Olivier Pla in the No. 60 MSR Acura ARX-05 DPi car he shared with Montoya and Cameron at the season-ending Petit Le Mans. He shared MSR&#x27;s No. 60 Acura ARX-05 entry for the Endurance Cup races of the 2022 IMSA season alongside full-season racers Tom Blomqvist and Jarvis as he returned to competing in IndyCar full-time. Castroneves fended off Taylor in the final laps of the 2022 24 Hours of Daytona to win the event for the second year in succession. Although he was set to enter both the 12 Hours of Sebring and the IndyCar round at Texas that were held on the same weekend, he later withdrew from the Sebring race due to logistical complications and he was replaced by Stoffel Vandoorne. Castroneves went on to win the season-ending Petit Le Mans alongside Blomqvist and Jarvis.

At the 2023 24 Hours of Daytona, Castroneves achieved his third consecutive victory in the race, sharing the No. 60 MSR Acura ARX-06 LMDh entry with Blomqvist, Colin Braun and Pagenaud as an endurance driver in the GTP category. He then finished sixth at the 12 Hours of Sebring following a left-rear wheel suspension failure. Castroneves, Blomqvist and Braun won the season-ending Petit Le Mans after overcoming a collision with a slower GT car that necessitated a toe-link replacement. MSR left IMSA following the race primarily due to IMSA deciding that the team manipulated tyre data pressure at Daytona, so Castroneves did not compete at the 2024 24 Hours of Daytona.

J.J. O&#x27;Malley of &quot;Auto Racing Digest&quot; wrote that Castroneves received some coverage for &quot;his charisma and personality&quot;, adding, &quot;The driver seems to permanently wear a smile, and he&#x27;s not afraid to show his emotions.&quot; After 2007, he became more recognized for winning &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; than his sporting achievements. A merchandise sales tallying company attributed Castroneves&#x27; popularity outside racing for increasing IndyCar attendances by 68 percent in 2008. Of his IndyCar Series legacy, NBC Sports&#x27; Tony DiZinno said, &quot;With four championship runners-up in 2002, 2008, 2013 and 2014, Castroneves is your equivalent Dan Marino, Buffalo Bills or Mark Martin of IndyCar. He&#x27;ll forever be acknowledged as one of the best, but perhaps known more as the driver who never quite won a title&quot;.

<doc id="345353" wikidata="Q6515794" url="?curid=345353" title="Robin Russell, 14th Duke of Bedford">
<text>(Henry) Robin Ian Russell, 14th Duke of Bedford (21 January 1940 – 13 June 2003) was a British peer, stockbroker and animal conservationist. He became well known to the public by appearing in three series of the BBC reality television programme &quot;Country House&quot;. During his childhood he was styled by the courtesy title Lord Howland, one of his grandfather&#x27;s lesser titles, and from 1953 (following his father&#x27;s inheritance of the dukedom) and for most of his adult life was styled by the courtesy title Marquess of Tavistock, his father&#x27;s senior subsidiary title, and as he survived his father by only months, he himself held the dukedom for that short period during 2002–2003.

==Career==
===Origins and education===
He was born on 21 January 1940 at the Ritz Hotel in London, the son and heir apparent of John Ian Robert Russell, Lord Howland (1917–2002) (from August 1940 Marquess of Tavistock and from 1953 13th Duke of Bedford), by his first wife Clare Gwendolyn Bridgman (1903–1945), who died of an overdose of sedatives, formerly the wife of Major Kenneth Chamney Walpole Hollway, MC. His father emigrated to South Africa in 1948 to farm in the Paarl area and the future 14th Duke was educated there at Western Province Preparatory School and then at the Diocesan College. He completed his education at Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland and at Harvard University in the United States. The vast historic estates of the Dukes of Bedford included Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, the Bedford Estate in London&#x27;s Covent Garden and Bloomsbury and estates in Devonshire around the town of Tavistock, with a residence at Endsleigh Cottage.

===Business career===
In 1974, while working as a stockbroker at de Zoete &amp; Bevan and living in Suffolk, he took over the running of the Woburn Estates from his father, a pioneer of the commercialisation of country houses, who then retired as a tax-exile to Monaco. Robin, then styled Marquess of Tavistock, continued with the modernisation of the Woburn estate and Woburn Safari Park established by his father, and himself established the Woburn Golf and Country Club, a successful business on the Woburn estate. However, his plans to develop a major theme park at Woburn failed to come to fruition. 

He suffered a severe stroke on 21 February 1988 when he was aged just 48, which he was not expected to survive. It curtailed his powers of speech and movement and led him to pursue a more relaxed lifestyle, and to be much less of a workaholic during his later years. 

With his wife, Henrietta Tiarks (Marchioness of Tavistock and later Duchess of Bedford), he appeared in the BBC series &quot;Country House&quot;, detailing the daily life and estate management at Woburn Abbey, the ancestral seat of the Russell family. 

He succeeded his father to the dukedom on 25 October 2002, but died just months later on 13 June 2003 after another stroke in the Tavistock Intensive Care Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, Bloomsbury, London, which he had been instrumental in establishing. This made him the shortest-lived Duke of Bedford. He had already handed over control of Woburn Abbey to his eldest son Andrew, Lord Howland, in 2001.

===Père David&#x27;s deer===
After the extirpation in 1900 of the Chinese population of Père David&#x27;s deer (or Milu deer), Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, was instrumental in saving the species, having acquired the few remaining deer from European zoos and formed a breeding herd in the deer park at Woburn Abbey. Robin Russell, then Marquess of Tavistock (the future 14th Duke of Bedford), the 11th Duke&#x27;s great-grandson, was instrumental in re-establishing the species in China, having donated to that country two drafts from the Woburn herd, one in 1985 (5 males and 15 females) and the other in 1987 (18 females). The deer were released into the Nan Haizi Garden, later renamed Milu Park, in southern Beijing, the former imperial hunting grounds of the Ming and Qing emperors where the deer were last known in China. In 2005 the Beijing authorities erected a statue of the 14th Duke (who had died two years earlier) at Nan Haizi to mark the 20th Anniversary of the Milu reintroduction, in the presence of his widow and three sons.

==Marriage and issue==
As Marquess of Tavistock on 20 June 1961 at St Clement Danes Church in London (south of the Russell family&#x27;s estate of Covent Garden and Bloomsbury) he married Henrietta Joan Tiarks (born London, 5 March 1940), debutante of the year in 1957 and then a successful model, the only surviving child and heiress of Henry Frederick Tiarks (born Woodheath, Chislehurst, 8 September 1900 – died Marbella, 2 July 1995), a partner and director of Schroders merchant bank, by his second wife (whom he married on 3 October 1936) Ina Florence Marshman Bell (born London, 5 November 1903 – died Marbella, 10 April 1989), an actress known as Joan Barry, whose first husband had been Henry Hampson. Henry Tiarks had married firstly on 27 April 1930 (divorced in 1936) Lady Millicent Olivia Mary Taylour (died 24 December 1975), daughter of Geoffrey Taylour, 4th Marquess of Headfort. Henrietta, Dowager Duchess of Bedford, is a granddaughter of Frank Cyril Tiarks and a relative of Mark Phillips, and following her husband&#x27;s death spends most of her time at their house in Matamata, New Zealand. By Henrietta Tiarks he had issue three sons:
* Andrew Ian Henry Russell, 15th Duke of Bedford (b. 30 March 1962), eldest son and heir, who is married with a son (Henry Robin Charles Russell, Marquess of Tavistock (b.2005)) and a daughter;
* Lord Robin Loel Hastings Russell (b. 12 August 1963)
* Lord James Edward Herbrand Russell (b. 11 February 1975)

<text>System 7 (later named Mac OS 7) is the seventh major release of the classic Mac OS operating system for Macintosh computers, made by Apple Computer. It was launched on May 13, 1991, to succeed System 6 with virtual memory, personal file sharing, QuickTime, TrueType fonts, the Force Quit dialog, and an improved user interface.

It was code-named &quot;Big Bang&quot; in development and the initial release was named &quot;The System&quot; or &quot;System&quot; like all earlier versions. With version 7.5.1, the name &quot;Mac OS&quot; debuted on the boot screen, and the operating system was officially renamed to Mac OS in 1997 with version 7.6. The Mac OS 7 line was the longest-lasting major version of the Classic Mac OSes due to the troubled development of Copland, an operating system intended to be the successor to OS 7 before its cancellation and replacement with Mac OS 8.

==Development==

By 1988, the Macintosh had been on the market for four years. Some aspects of the operating system were beginning to fall behind those of Microsoft Windows. Many of the assumptions of the System software architecture were obsolete – mainly, the single-tasking model, the replacement of which had first been examined in 1986&#x27;s Switcher and then replaced with MultiFinder in System 5.

In March 1988, shortly before the release of System 6, a group of senior technical staff and managers at Apple held an offsite meeting to plan the future course of Mac OS development. Improvements that seemed achievable in the short term were written on blue index cards, longer-term goals like true multitasking on pink cards, and more ambitious ideas like an object-oriented file system on red cards. The blue and pink ideas proceeded in parallel teams. The Blue team nicknamed itself Blue Meanies, after characters in the film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, and released System 7 in 1991. Pink was spun off into Taligent, Inc in 1992 within the AIM alliance with IBM.

==Overview==
===Changes===
As intended with the Blue and Pink model, improvements in System 7 are significant but incremental.

* A new Sound Manager API, version 2.0, replaces the older &quot;ad hoc&quot; APIs. The new APIs provided significantly improved hardware abstraction and higher-quality playback.
* 32-bit QuickDraw, supporting so-called &quot;true color&quot; imaging, is standard; it was previously available as a system extension.
* System 7 allows a 32-bit program address space. This expanded the memory addressing capabilities from the previous 24-bit address space and increased the system memory limit from 8MB to 4GB.
* System 7 makes MultiFinder&#x27;s cooperative multitasking mandatory.
* Trash became a normal directory allowing items to be preserved between reboots and disk eject events instead of being purged.
* System extensions are relocated to their own subfolder rather than in the root level of the System Folder as in System 6. They can be installed or removed simply by moving these &quot;extensions&quot; to or from the folder and then rebooting the computer. 
* Similarly, the Control Panel desk accessory becomes the Control Panels folder. The control panels themselves are separate files stored within this directory.
* Under System 6, the Apple Menu contains both a list of desk accessories and a list of running programs under MultiFinder. In System 7 the list of active programs is relocated to its own Application Menu.
* System 7.1 introduces System Enablers, small extensions that are loaded at startup to support Macintosh models introduced since the last OS revision.
*Cannot run on Macintosh 512Ke.

===New features===
* Personal File Sharing – along with user interface improvements for AppleTalk, System 7 includes a basic file-sharing server allowing any machine to publish folders to the AppleTalk network.
* Aliases – small files that represent another object in the file system. Similar in concept to Unix symbolic links and Windows shortcuts, an alias in System 7 acts as a redirect to any object in the file system, such as a document, an application, a folder, a hard disk, a network share or removable medium or a printer. 
* Drag and drop – document icons can be dragged with the mouse and &quot;dropped&quot; onto application icons to open in the targeted application. System 7.5&#x27;s Drag Manager expanded the concept system-wide to include multiple data types such as text or audio data.
* &quot;Stationery&quot;, allowing users to save often-used document styles as a template. &quot;Stationery-aware&quot; applications create a new, untitled file containing the template data.
*Balloon Help, a widget-identification system similar to tooltips.
* AppleScript, a scripting language for automating tasks. 
* AppleEvents, a new interprocess communication model for &quot;high-level&quot; events to be sent to applications including support for AppleEvents over an AppleTalk network.
* Publish and Subscribe permits data &quot;published&quot; by one application to be &quot;subscribed&quot; to in a document of another application, so that it is automatically updated if the original is changed.
* TrueType outline fonts, replacing bitmapped fonts and outline PostScript printer fonts. TrueType for the first time offers a single font format that scales to any size on screen and on paper.
* A newly colorized user interface, for machines that support color.

===Installation===
After initial publication on a set of 15 floppy disks, System 7 became the first Apple operating system to be released on a compact disc. Unlike earlier systems, System 7 did not come bundled with major software packages. Newly purchased Macintosh computers had System 7 installed and were often bundled with software such as HyperCard, At Ease and &quot;Mouse Practice&quot;. Later, the Macintosh Performa family added various software bundles including ClarisWorks, The New Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia, Microsoft Bookshelf, &quot;Spectre VR&quot; and &quot;Power Pete&quot;. Since System 7 was introduced before the Internet came to popular usage, software such as MacTCP, FreePPP, and Netscape were not included. They later became available on disk from Internet service providers and bundled with books such as Adam C. Engst&#x27;s Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh. Power Macintosh machines also included NuCalc, a graphing calculator. System 7 includes AppleTalk networking and file-sharing software in the form of system extensions and control panels.

The basic utilities installed by default with System 7 include TeachText (which was replaced by SimpleText in later versions) for basic text editing tasks and reading readme documents. Also available on the additional &quot;Disk Tools&quot; floppy disk are Disk First Aid for disk repair and Apple HD SC Setup for initializing and partitioning disks.

Later versions of System 7, specifically System 7.5 and Mac OS 7.6, come with dedicated &quot;Utilities&quot; and &quot;Apple Extras&quot; folders including: AppleScript, Disk Copy, QuickDraw GX Extras and QuickTime Movie Player. More optional extras and utilities can be manually installed from the System CD.

===Transition to PowerPC===
System 7.1.2 is the first version of the Macintosh System Software to support Apple&#x27;s new PowerPC-based computers. 68k applications that had not yet been updated to run natively on these systems were emulated transparently (without the user having to intervene) by a built-in 68k processor emulator. Fat binaries, which contained the code necessary to run natively on both PowerPC and 68k systems, became common during this time. This process was similar to the distribution of universal binaries during the Mac transition to Intel processors in 2006, as well as the Mac transition to Apple silicon beginning in 2020.

System 7.1.2 is the only release of the Macintosh operating system that boots stating &quot;Welcome to Power Macintosh.&quot; Release 7.1.2P reverts this.

===PC compatibility===
System 7.0 and 7.1 have a utility called Apple File Exchange, which accesses the contents of FAT- and Apple II-formatted floppy disks. Since System 7 Pro, PC Exchange is included, which allows the system to mount FAT-formatted floppy disks on the desktop like Macintosh disks. OS/2 disks can use the FAT file system. Macs can read and write UNIX file systems using extra software. System 7 accesses PC networks and uses TCP/IP and other compatible networking stacks.

===Miscellaneous===
System 7 had a larger memory footprint than System 6. System 6 could boot the system from a single 800k floppy disk and uses about of RAM, whereas System 7 used well over one megabyte. It was some time before the average Mac shipped with enough RAM built-in for System 7 to be truly comfortable. System 7 was the first system release that could no longer be usefully run on floppy-only systems. Although most Macintosh models sold at the time included a hard disk as standard equipment, owners of older models were required to upgrade their hardware by buying either a new Mac or an external SCSI hard disk drive if they wished to run System 7.

The official system documentation, &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot;, initially shipped in three volumes, with another added to describe the changes introduced with the Mac Plus, and another for the Mac II and Mac SE.

System 7&#x27;s virtual memory requires a Macintosh with a paged memory management unit (PMMU). The Motorola 68030 CPU has one, or one can be added to a 68020-equipped Macintosh II.

System 7.0 was adopted quite rapidly by Mac users and quickly became one of the base requirements for new software.

The engineering group within Apple responsible for System 7 came to be known as the &quot;Blue Meanies&quot;, named after the blue index cards on which were written the features that could be implemented in a relatively short time as part of Apple&#x27;s operating system strategy. 

The pink index card features were handled by the Pink group, later becoming the ill-fated Taligent project.

System 7.0 is the last version of the Macintosh operating system that was available at no charge and could be freely redistributed. Although System 7 could be purchased from Apple, the cost was nominal and considered to only cover duplication and media. It was common for Macintosh dealers to allow customers to use the store&#x27;s demo machines to copy System 7 install disks for the cost of a box of floppies. CD-ROM magazines such as &quot;Nautilus&quot; included System 7 on their disks. After Mac users downloaded thousands of copies of System 7 from online services such as AOL, CompuServe, and GEnie, Apple surveyed the services and based on this popularity started selling the Mac OS as a retail product with System 7.1. Apple continued charging for major operating system upgrades until the release of OS X Mavericks in 2013.

==Version history==
Soon after the initial release of System 7, the 7.0.1 minor update was released in October 1991, which updated the Portable and Brightness control panels, added the Caps Lock extension - which showed an up-pointing arrow on screen if the Caps Lock key was depressed on PowerBooks - and added the Cache Switch control panel in addition to RAM disk and sound management optimizations for 68040 systems. Three small patches called &quot;System 7 Tune-Up&quot; also followed, which initially added the extension &quot;System 7 Tuner&quot; that improved memory management by quitting unused items, like applications and AppleTalk, and added &quot;minimum&quot; and &quot;preferred&quot; memory allotments to an application&#x27;s &quot;Get Info&quot; box in its 1.0 version. This would be followed by version 1.1, which included LaserWriter driver version 7.1.1 and added a hidden extension called &quot;Tuna Helper&quot;, intended to fix the &quot;disappearing files&quot; bug in which the system would lose files. The final release, 1.1.1, included everything 1.1 included but also added the StyleWriter 7.2.2 printer drivers, Chooser 7.1 and a minor update to Tuna Helper.

===System 7.1===
In August 1992, the 7.1 update was released. This is the first version of the system software that Apple charged money for. Of this change, David Pogue wrote:

New to 7.1 is the Fonts folder. This replaced the often time-consuming method of dragging fonts to and from the System file, introduced in System 7.0; it also replaced the Font/DA Mover application from System 6, which could also be used with 7.0. System 7.1 also included a lot of internal changes to support the internationalization of dates, times, and numbers. It was also the first version to support &quot;Enablers&quot;, which removed the requirement to release a new version of the system software every time new hardware was released.

A set of specialized versions of 7.1, ranging from 7.1P1 to 7.1P6 (excluding 7.1P4) were created and included with various Performa models that were already available or were released after 7.1. These specialized versions included At Ease, Launcher, and some other changes that were integrated into later versions of the system software.

The first major upgrade was System 7.1.1, also known as &quot;System 7 Pro&quot;. This release was a bundle of 7.1 with AppleScript tools, QuickTime and Apple Open Collaboration Environment (AOCE). While System 7 had some trouble running on slightly older machines due to its memory footprint, System 7 Pro barely fit into any Macintosh computers of the time. It was most commonly used for its minor bug fixes rather than its new functionality.

Apple co-founded the AIM alliance (Apple, IBM, and Motorola) in 1992, shortly after the release of System 7 in 1991, and started developing PowerPC-based machines that later became the Power Macintosh family. Support for these machines resulted in System 7.1.2.

System 7.1.2 was never offered for retail sale; it shipped with the first batches of the PowerPC Macs and a 68k version shipped with a small number of Quadra 600 series systems. Later shipments shipped with System 7.5 instead.

System 7.1.2P was the same as 7.1.2 and shipped with the Performa 630, LC 630, and Quadra 630 models that were released between July and November 1994.

===System 7.5===
On September 12, 1994, System 7.5 was released with bug fixes from previous updates and several new features:

*An updated startup screen with a progress bar
*A new interactive help system called Apple Guide
*A clock in the menu bar (from the third-party freeware control panel SuperClock!)
*An Apple menu item called Stickies (formerly a third-party application called &quot;PasteIt Notes&quot;), which provided virtual Post-It Notes
*WindowShade, another former third-party shareware control panel, provided the ability to condense a window down to its title bar. It was introduced as a &quot;minimize&quot; feature to compete with Windows 95 as Mac OS had no taskbar or dock.
*MacTCP was bundled, enabling any Macintosh to connect to the Internet out of the box for the first time.
*The Control Strip (a fast way to change the system volume, control the playback of audio CDs, manage file sharing and printers, and change the monitor resolution and color depth) was enabled on desktop Macintosh models for the first time. It had previously only been included with the PowerBook series.
*A new Desktop Patterns control panel allowed for tiled patterns up to 128x128 pixels with 8-bit color; previous versions were limited to 8x8 pixel tiles with a maximum of eight possible colors. Similar functionality was found on earlier system versions exclusive to Performa models and was housed in the General Controls panel.
*The Extensions Manager (enabling the user to turn extensions and control panels on and off; also based on a formerly third-party control panel)
*PowerTalk, a system-level email handling service and the originator of the Keychain system. 
*The Launcher, a control panel containing shortcut buttons for frequently used programs (in a manner akin to the macOS Dock)
*A hierarchical Apple menu (folders within the Apple Menu Items folder would expand into submenus showing their contents. Again, based on a third party control panel; HAM by Microseeds publishing)
*System-wide drag &amp; drop for text and other data (selections can be simply dragged with the mouse and dropped to their new destination, bypassing the clipboard)
*A scriptable Finder
*QuickDraw GX, a 2-D graphics rendering and geometry engine
*For the PowerPC only, an advanced, 3d Graphing Calculator, secretly developed at Apple by a former third party contractor
*Support for OpenDoc

System 7.5 is codenamed &quot;Capone&quot;, a reference to Al Capone and &quot;Chicago&quot;, which is the codename for Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 95 and is also the name of the default system font in Mac OS until version 8.

System 7.5.1 is primarily a bug fix of 7.5 but also introduced a new &quot;Mac OS&quot; startup screen in preparation for Mac clones.

System 7.5.2, released only for the first PCI-based Power Macs, introduced Apple&#x27;s new networking architecture, Open Transport.

System 7.5.3 is a major bug-fix update that also included Open Transport for other PowerPC-based machines and some 68k-based machines. 7.5.3 improved the 68k emulator, and added translucent dragging to the Drag Manager. It included the first version of Control Strip to be compatible with all Macs. This was the first version of Mac OS to support SMP (9500/MP).

System 7.5.3 Revision 2 included performance enhancements; better reliability for PowerBooks using the third-party RAM Doubler program; improved reliability for PowerBook 500, 2300, and 5300 series computers with the PowerPC Upgrade Card; improved reliability when using the Startup Disk control panel; and improved reliability when copying files to 1  GB hard disks.

System 7.5.3 Revision 2.1 was shipped with the Performa 6400/180 and 6400/200; this particular release is specific to these machines as there was stability problems with System 7.5.3 Release 2 on the new hardware, especially with the video card and transferring files over LocalTalk.

System 7.5.4 was pulled due to a mistake at Apple, in which some components were not included in the installer.

System 7.5.5 included significant performance improvements for virtual memory and memory management on PowerPC-based Macs, including the elimination of one type 11 error. Also included are several reliability improvements, such as fixes for Macs using floppy disks equipped with a DOS compatibility card, improved hard disk access for PowerPC PowerBooks and Performa 5400 through 9500 computers, fixes for Macs that included an Apple TV Tuner or Macintosh TV Remote Control, improvements to LocalTalk and networking (especially for the Performa 5400 and 6400), fixes to system startup for the faster 180  MHz Macs (which included PowerPC 604 or 604e processors), improved reliability when using sound-intensive applications on Quadra or Centris computers that contained the PowerPC upgrade card, and improved stability when using multiple background applications and shared printers on a network. System 7.5.5 is also the last System 7 release that can run on 68000-based Macs such as the Macintosh Plus and Macs with ROMs that lack support for 32-bit addressing such as Macintosh IIcx. 7.6 and later required a 68030 processor and 32-bit-addressing-capable ROM and will automatically turn on 32-bit addressing on boot.

===Mac OS 7.6===
Mac OS 7.6 (codenamed &quot;Harmony&quot;) is the final major update, released in 1997. With 7.6, the operating system was officially called &quot;Mac OS&quot; instead of &quot;System&quot;. New features include a revamped Extensions Manager, more native PowerPC code for Power Macs, more bundled Internet tools and utilities, and a more stable Finder with increased memory allocation. In this version, the PowerTalk feature added in 7.5 was removed due to poor application support, and support for a large number of older Macintosh models was dropped, including those with a Motorola 68000 or 68020.

Mac OS 7.6.1 ported the 68k exception handling routines to PowerPC, turning type 11 errors into less harmful errors (type 1, 2, or 3, usually) as crashing applications would more often terminate safely instead of crashing the operating system.

Through this period, Apple had been attempting to release a completely new &quot;modern&quot; operating system, named Copland. When the Copland project was abandoned in 1996, Apple announced plans to release an OS update every six months until Rhapsody (which would by 2001 evolve into what was released as Mac OS X) shipped. Two more releases were shipped, now officially branded as Mac OS: Mac OS 7.6 and the minor bug fix 7.6.1. Future versions were released as Mac OS 8–8.6 and Mac OS 9–9.2.

Released during a troubled time in Apple&#x27;s history, 7.6 is known for several bugs, such as the inability to customize what components are installed to the system and its tendency to crash on some systems when they are shut down while a RAM disk is in use.

<text>Skates are cartilaginous fish belonging to the family Rajidae in the superorder Batoidea of rays. More than 150 species have been described, in 17 genera. Softnose skates and pygmy skates were previously treated as subfamilies of Rajidae (Arhynchobatinae and Gurgesiellinae), but are now considered as distinct families. Alternatively, the name &quot;skate&quot; is used to refer to the entire order of Rajiformes (families Anacanthobatidae, Arhynchobatidae, Gurgesiellidae and Rajidae).

Members of Rajidae are distinguished by a stiff snout and a rostrum that is not reduced.

== Taxonomy and systematics==
===Evolution===
Skates belong to the ancient lineage of cartilaginous fishes. Fossil denticles (tooth-like scales in the skin) resembling those of today&#x27;s chondrichthyans date at least as far back as the Ordovician, with the oldest unambiguous fossils of cartilaginous fish dating from the middle Devonian. A clade within this diverse family, the Neoselachii, emerged by the Triassic, with the best-understood neoselachian fossils dating from the Jurassic. This clade is represented today by sharks, sawfish, rays and skates.

The body plan of skates is caused by skate-specific genomic rearrangements that have altered the three-dimensional regulatory landscape of genes. These changes arose about 286–221  million years ago when skates diverged from sharks.

===Classification===
The skate belongs to the class Chondrichthyes. This class consists of all the cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and stingrays. Chondrichthyes is divided into two subclasses; of which Elasmobranchii includes skates, rays, and sharks. Skates are the most diverse elasmobranch group, comprising over 20% of the known species. The number of species is likely to increase as taxonomic issues are resolved and new species are identified. Thefollowing genera recognized in the family Rajidae:

Skates have more valid species than any other group of cartilaginous fishes. Since 1950, 126 new species of skates have been discovered. Five scientists take credit for the rapid increase of findings. The Rajidae are considered monophyletic because of their similarity in appearance. There are 18 genera and about 250 valid species. However, there is little information about the diets of about 24% of these species. There are at least 45 dubious species of skates worldwide.

== Description ==
=== General Batoidea characteristics ===
Skates are cartilaginous fishes like other Chondrichthyes, however, skates, like rays and other Rajiformes, have a flat body shape with flat pectoral fins that extend the length of their body. This structure creates power for forward propulsion, providing the emergence swimming capabilities that enabled skates to colonize the sea floor.

A large portion of the skate&#x27;s dorsal body is covered by rough skin made of placoid scales. Placoid scales have a pointed tip that is oriented caudally and are homologous to teeth. Their mouths are located on the underside of the body, with a jaw suspension common to Batoids known as euhyostyly. Skate&#x27;s gill slits are located ventrally as well, but dorsal spiracles allow the skate to be partially buried in floor sediment and still complete respiratory exchange. Also located on the dorsal side of the skate are their two eyes which allow for predator awareness. In addition to their pectoral fins, skates have a first and second dorsal fin, caudal fin and paired pelvic fins. Distinct from their rhomboidal shape is a long fleshy slender tail. While skate anatomy is similar to other Batoidea, features such as their electric organ and mermaid&#x27;s purse create clear distinctions.
=== Skate specific characteristics ===
==== Mermaid&#x27;s purse ====

Skates produce their young in an egg case called a mermaid&#x27;s purse. These egg cases have distinct characteristics that are individualized to each species. This makes a great tool for identifying different species of skates. One of these identifiable structures is the keel. The keel is a flexible ridge that runs along the outside of the structure. Another characteristic is the number of embryos in the egg case. Some species contain only one embryo while others can have up to seven. The size of the fibrous shell around the case is another characteristic. Some species have thick layers on the exterior.

==== Electric organ ====
The electric organ is a characteristic exclusive to aquatic species. Among the Chondrichthyes, the only groups to possess electric organs are the electric ray and the skates. Unlike many other electrogenic fishes, skates are unique in having paired electric organs which run longitudinally through the tail in the lateral musculature of the notochord. The impulses put out by the electric organs of the skate are considered to be weak, asynchronous, long-lasting signals. Although the anatomy of the skate&#x27;s electric organ is well described, its function is poorly understood. Some research suggests the electric impulses are too weak to be a mechanism used for defense or hunting. It is also too irregular to be useful for electrolocation purposes. The most reasonable explanation in the literature suggests that the electric organ discharges may be used as a form of communication used for reproduction purposes.

== Distribution and habitats ==
Skates are primarily found from the intertidal down to depths greater than . They are most commonly found along outer continental shelves and upper slopes. They are typically more diverse at higher latitudes and in deep-water. In fact, skates are the only cartilaginous fish taxon to exhibit more diversity of species at higher latitudes. A cool, temperate to polar water in the deep sea can be a favorable environment for skates. As the water becomes more shallow and warmer, skates are seen to be replaced by stingrays. Skates are absent from brackish and freshwater environments. However, there is a single estuarine species that has been found in Tasmania, Australia. Also, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection has caught and studied skates within the Long Island Sound estuary. Some skate fauna have been found inhabiting areas of rock cobble and high rocky relief.

== Behavior and ecology ==
=== Reproduction ===
Skates mate at the same nursery ground each year. In order to fertilize the egg, males use claspers, a structure attached to the pelvic fins. The claspers allow them to direct the flow of semen into the female&#x27;s cloaca. Skates are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs with very little development in the mother. This is one major difference from rays, which are viviparous, meaning they give birth to live young. When a female skate is fertilized, a protected case forms around the embryo called an egg case, or more commonly mermaid&#x27;s purse. This egg case is then deposited out of the mother&#x27;s body onto the ocean floor where the skates develop for up to 15 months before they enter the external environment.

=== Diet and feeding ===
The majority of skates feed on bottom dwelling animals, such as shrimp, crab, oyster, clams, and other invertebrates. To feed on these animals they have grinding plates in their mouths. Skates are an influential part of the food webs of demersal marine communities. They utilize similar resources to those of other upper trophic-level marine predators, such as seabirds, marine mammals, and sharks. The flattened body shape, ventral eyes and well developed spiracles of the skate allows them to live benthically, buried in the sediment or using a longitudinal undulation of the pectoral fins known as Rajiform locomotion to glide along the water floor. Current research suggests that some species of skates, in addition to their Rajiform locomotion, use their pelvic fins to perform ambulatory locomotion. This form of locomotion performed by the skate is being explored as a possible origin for our own development of walking by looking for similar neural pathways used for movement between skates and animals walking on land.

==Skates versus stingrays==
Skates are like stingrays in that they have five pairs of gill slits that are located ventrally, which means on the underside of their body (unlike sharks that have their gills located on their sides). Skates and rays both have pectoral fins that are flat and expanded, which are typically fused to the head. Both skates and stingrays typically have their eyes on top of their head. Skates also share similar feeding habits with rays.

Skates are different from rays in that they lack a whip-like tail and stinging spines. However, some skates have electric organs located in their tail. The main difference between skates and rays is that skates lay eggs, whereas rays give birth to live young.

Moreover, skates can be more abundant than rays, and are fished for food in some parts of the world.

Skates have slow growth rates and, since they mature late, low reproductive rates. As a result, skates are vulnerable to overfishing and appear to have been overfished and are suffering reduced population levels in many parts of the world.

<text>Balearic warbler (Curruca balearica) is a typical warbler, genus &quot;Curruca&quot;. It is endemic to the Balearic Islands, apart from Menorca. It groups with the Marmora&#x27;s warbler, Tristram&#x27;s warbler and the Dartford warbler (Helbig 2001, Jønsson &amp; Fjeldså 2006).

These are small, long-tailed, large-headed birds, overall very similar to their close relatives in the Dartford warbler group. Balearic warblers are grey above and pale grey below, adding a pinkish tinge. Adult males have darker patches on the forehead and between the eye and the pointed bill. The legs and iris are red.

These small passerine birds are found in open country with thorny bushes and heather. 3-5 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush. Like most &quot;warblers&quot;, they are insectivorous.

<text>A desk accessory (DA) or desklet in computing is a small transient or auxiliary application that can be run concurrently in a desktop environment with any other application on the system. Early examples, such as Sidekick and Macintosh desk accessories, used special programming models to provide a small degree of multitasking on systems that initially did not have any other multitasking ability.

==Personal information managers==
Early personal information managers, such as Norton Desktop and Borland&#x27;s Sidekick, provided pop-up calculator, alarm, calendar and other functions for single-tasking operating systems like MS-DOS using terminate-and-stay-resident techniques.

==Apple Macintosh==

Introduced in 1984 as part of the operating system for the Apple Macintosh computer, a Desk Accessory (DA) was a piece of software written as a device driver, conforming to a particular programming model. The purpose of this model was to permit very small helper-type applications to be run concurrently with any other application on the system. This provided a small degree of multitasking on a system that initially did not have any other multitasking ability.

DAs were implemented as a special class of driver. It was installed in the driver queue, and given time periodically and co-operatively as a result of the host application calling &quot;SystemTask()&quot; within its main loop. A DA was permitted to have a user interface as long as it was confined to one main window. A special window frame with black title bar and rounded corners was reserved for the use of DAs so that the user could distinguish it from the windows of the hosting application.

Typical early DAs included the Calculator and Alarm Clock. The control panel, Chooser, and Scrapbook were initially implemented as DAs. Third-party DAs such as spelling checkers could be purchased. It was considered hard to write a DA, especially early on when there was little in the way of developer tools. However, since on the early Mac OS drivers did not have any special privileges, writing a DA was, with practice, no more difficult than any other application.

A special Font/DA Mover utility was used to change the configuration of DAs. Because DAs were not installed or launched in the same way that applications were, the user could not drag and drop DAs into or out of the system. They resided in the &quot;System&quot; file&#x27;s &#x27;DRVR&#x27; resources, like actual drivers, though they could be installed in any file whose resources were loaded into the memory, and were stored in &quot;suitcases&quot; when not installed in the system file. If installed within a separate application, such as MacWrite, their functionality would be accessible only when that application was running. That is, a desk accessory installed as a resource within an application would appear on the Apple menu as a desk accessory only when that application was active. It could then be activated while the application was run and would then disappear when the application was terminated through the Quit function. (Similarly, the FKEY resources could be installed either within the System so as to be universally available, or within an application so as to be available only when that application was active). As a resource numbering scheme was implemented for marking resources as belonging to another resource of some particular type and number in the same file, such as a DA (&#x27;DRVR&#x27;), it was possible for desk accessories to have a limited &quot;resource fork&quot; of their own within the file they were contained in; the mover utility recognised such resources and moved them along with the actual DA code resource they were associated with.

With the advent of System 7, which included a standard cooperative multitasking feature, the need for DAs diminished greatly, and developers were encouraged to develop small applications instead. The system continued to run DAs (and still does up to Mac OS 9.x) for backward compatibility. Under System 7 and later, DAs could be moved and renamed using the Finder like normal applications, removing the need for Font/DA Mover and confining suitcases to font management. When a DA was run under System 7, it always executed in the Finder&#x27;s address space. The icon for a desk accessory program under System 7 and later is roughly a reversed version of the application icon, with the writing hand on the left side instead of the right.

A similar mechanism to allow small utility programs to run along with regular applications was also present in the operating system for the Apple IIGS and Apple IIe.

==GEM==

GEM resembled the Macintosh closely in many respects. One example was the presence of desk accessories, for the same reason: to allow multiple programs to be used in a system that only supported one full application at a time (although GEM desk accessories used task switching and not cooperative multitasking like the Macintosh.)

From a programming point of view, desk accessories were implemented, like other GEM applications, as DOS .EXE files, with names ending with .ACC (Accessory) rather than .APP (Application). Each .ACC file could support multiple accessories; all three of the standard GEM accessories (Calculator, Clock and Print Spooler) were provided by codice_1. Installation was simply a matter of placing the .ACC in the correct directory - codice_2 in earlier versions, and codice_3 in GEM/3 and later.

Since each desk accessory loaded reduced the amount of memory available for programs, one technique for temporarily increasing available space was to rename one or more .ACC files to have a different suffix (usually .ACX) and restart GEM. On the Amstrad PC-1512, for example, the Snapshot accessory was shipped as codice_4 and had to be renamed to .ACC prior to use.

Desk accessories continued to be supported in ViewMAX, the DR-DOS file manager, which was supplied with almost unchanged versions of Calculator and Clock.

==Palm OS==
For much the same reason as desk accessories were used in Mac OS and in GEM, namely to allow more than one simultaneous program on a system which did not support multitasking, the concept of desk accessories was extended to Palm OS by third-party developers. DA are applets launched by an application or hack serving as a DA launcher. The DA launcher may watch for keystrokes or other system events and pop up a predefined desk accessory. Many general-purpose Palm OS launcher applications are capable of launching DAs as well.

A desk accessory program is a Palm resource database of type &#x27;DAcc&#x27;, specified to include a single &#x27;code&#x27; #1000 resource that contains the binary code implementing the desk accessory. Global or static variables are not available, but a DA can call user interface APIs. It is possible for a DA to have user interface resources in its database. The desk accessory launcher transfers execution to the first byte of the &#x27;code&#x27; #1000 resource.

DAs provide a modicum of multitasking. However, unlike in Mac OS and GEM, after the user is done working with the DA, it must be closed to return to the underlying application. It is possible to pop up one DA over another DA, though this might deplete stack space.
