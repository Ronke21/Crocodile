<text>The Irish Volunteers (), also known as the Irish Volunteer Force or the Irish Volunteer Army, was a paramilitary organisation established in 1913 by nationalists and republicans in Ireland. It was ostensibly formed in response to the formation of its Irish unionist/loyalist counterpart the Ulster Volunteers in 1912, and its declared primary aim was &quot;to secure and maintain the rights and liberties common to the whole people of Ireland&quot;. Its ranks included members of the &quot;Conradh na Gaeilge&quot;, Ancient Order of Hibernians, Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Increasing rapidly to a strength of nearly 200,000 by mid-1914, it split in September of that year over John Redmond&#x27;s support for the British war effort during World War I, with the smaller group opposed to Redmond&#x27;s decision retaining the name &quot;Irish Volunteers&quot;.

==Formation==

===Background===

The Irish Home Rule movement dominated political debate in the British Isles since Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone introduced the first Home Rule Bill in 1886, intended to grant a measure of self-government and national autonomy to Ireland, but which was rejected by the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The second Home Rule Bill, seven years later having passed the House of Commons, was vetoed by the House of Lords. It would be the third Home Rule Bill, introduced in 1912, which would lead to the crisis in Ireland between the Irish Catholics, most of whom were nationalists, and Unionists in Ulster.

On 28 September 1912 at Belfast City Hall just over 450,000 Unionists signed the Ulster Covenant to resist the granting of Home Rule. This was followed in January 1913 with the formation of the Ulster Volunteers composed of adult male Unionists to oppose the passage and implementation of the bill by force of arms if necessary. Nationalist politician Eoin MacNeill claimed that the establishment of the Ulster Volunteers was instigated, approved, and financed by members of Conservative Party; MacNeill further claimed that the Liberal Party was not &quot;terribly distressed by that proceeding.&quot;

===Initiative===
The initiative for a series of meetings leading up to the public inauguration of the Irish Volunteers came from the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). Bulmer Hobson, co-founder of the republican boy scouts, Fianna Éireann, and member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, believed the IRB should use the formation of the Ulster Volunteers as an &quot;excuse to try to persuade the public to form an Irish volunteer force&quot;. The IRB could not move in the direction of a volunteer force themselves, as any such action by known proponents of physical force would be suppressed, despite the precedent established by the Ulster Volunteers. They therefore confined themselves to encouraging the view that nationalists also ought to organise a volunteer force for the defence of Ireland. A small committee then began to meet regularly in Dublin from July 1913, who watched the growth of this opinion. They refrained however from any action until the precedent of Ulster should have first been established while waiting for the lead to come from a &quot;constitutional&quot; quarter.

The IRB began the preparations for the open organisation of the Irish Volunteers in January 1913. James Stritch, an IRB member, had the Irish National Foresters build a hall at the back of 41 Parnell Square in Dublin, which was the headquarters of the Wolfe Tone Clubs. Anticipating the formation of the Volunteers they began to learn foot-drill and military movements. The drilling was conducted by Stritch together with members of Fianna Éireann. They began by drilling a small number of IRB associated with the Dublin Gaelic Athletic Association, led by Harry Boland.

Michael Collins along with several other IRB members claim that the formation of the Irish Volunteers was not merely a &quot;knee-jerk reaction&quot; to the Ulster Volunteers, which is often supposed, but was in fact the &quot;old Irish Republican Brotherhood in fuller force.&quot;

===&quot;The North Began&quot;===
The IRB knew they would need a highly regarded figure as a public front that would conceal the reality of their control. The IRB found in Eoin MacNeill, Professor of Early and Medieval History at University College Dublin, the ideal candidate. McNeill&#x27;s academic credentials and reputation for integrity and political moderation had widespread appeal.

The O&#x27;Rahilly, assistant editor and circulation manager of the Gaelic League newspaper &quot;An Claidheamh Soluis&quot;, encouraged MacNeill to write an article for the first issue of a new series of articles for the paper. The O&#x27;Rahilly suggested to MacNeill that it should be on some wider subject than mere Gaelic pursuits. It was this suggestion which gave rise to the article entitled &quot;The North Began&quot;, giving the Irish Volunteers its public origins. On 1 November, MacNeill&#x27;s article suggesting the formation of an Irish volunteer force was published. MacNeill wrote,There is nothing to prevent the other twenty-eight counties from calling into existence citizen forces to hold Ireland &quot;for the Empire&quot;. It was precisely with this object that the Volunteers of 1782 were enrolled, and they became the instrument of establishing Irish self-government.

After the article was published, Hobson asked The O&#x27;Rahilly to see MacNeill, to suggest to him that a conference should be called to make arrangements for publicly starting the new movement. The article &quot;threw down the gauntlet to nationalists to follow the lead given by Ulster unionists.&quot; MacNeill was unaware of the detailed planning which was going on in the background, but was aware of Hobson&#x27;s political leanings. He knew the purpose as to why he was chosen, but he was determined not to be a puppet.

===Launch===
With MacNeill willing to take part, O&#x27;Rahilly and Hobson sent out invitations for the first meeting at Wynn&#x27;s Hotel in Abbey Street, Dublin, on 11 November. Hobson himself did not attend this meeting, believing his standing as an &quot;extreme nationalist&quot; might prove problematical. The IRB, however, was well represented by, among others, Seán Mac Diarmada and Éamonn Ceannt, who would prove to be substantially more extreme than Hobson. Several others meetings were soon to follow, as prominent nationalists planned the formation of the Volunteers, under the leadership of MacNeill. Meanwhile, labour leaders in Dublin began calling for the establishment of a citizens&#x27; defence force in the aftermath of the lock out of 19 August 1913. Thus formed the Irish Citizen Army, led by James Larkin and James Connolly, which, though it had similar aims, at this point had no connection with the Irish Volunteers (were later allies in the Easter Rising.)

The Volunteer organisation was publicly launched on 25 November, with their first public meeting and enrolment rally at the Rotunda in Dublin. The IRB organised this meeting to which all parties were invited, and brought 5000 enlistment blanks for distribution and handed out in books of one hundred each to each of the stewards. Every one of the stewards and officials wore on their lapel a small silken bow the centre of which was white, while on one side was green and on the other side orange and had long been recognised as the colours which the Irish Republican Brotherhood had adopted as the Irish national banner. The hall was filled to its 4,000 person capacity, with a further 3,000 spilling onto the grounds outside. Speakers at the rally included MacNeill, Patrick Pearse, and Michael Davitt, son of the Land League founder of the same name. Over the course of the following months the movement spread throughout the country, with thousands more joining every week.

==Organisation and leadership==
The original members of the Provisional Committee were:

*&quot;Members&quot;: Piaras Béaslaí (Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB)), Sir Roger Casement (GL), Éamonn Ceannt (IRB, GL, SF), John Fitzgibbon (GL, SF), Liam Gogan, Bulmer Hobson (IRB, Fianna Éireann (FÉ)), Michael J. Judge (AOH), Thomas Kettle (IPP, AOH), James Lenehan (AOH), Michael Lonergan (IRB, Fianna Éireann (FÉ)), Peter (Peadar) Macken (IRB, Labour leader, SF, GL), Seán Mac Diarmada (IRB, &quot;Irish Freedom&quot;), Thomas MacDonagh (GL), Liam Mellows (IRB), Maurice Moore (IPP, GL, Connaught Rangers), Séamus O&#x27;Connor (IRB), Colm O&#x27;Loughlin (IRB, St. Enda&#x27;s School (SES)), Peter O&#x27;Reilly (Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH)), Robert Page (IRB, Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA)), Patrick Pearse (GL, SES), Joseph M. Plunkett (GL, &quot;Irish Review&quot;), John Walsh (AOH), Peter White (Celtic Literary Society);
*&quot;Fianna Éireann representatives&quot;: Con Colbert (IRB), Eamon Martin (IRB), Patrick O&#x27;Riain (IRB).

The Manifesto of the Irish Volunteers was composed by MacNeill, with some minimal changes added by Tom Kettle and other members of the Provisional Committee. It stated that the organisation&#x27;s objectives were &quot;to secure and maintain the rights and liberties common to the whole people of Ireland&quot;, and that membership was open to all Irishmen &quot;without distinction of creed, politics or social grade.&quot; Though the &quot;rights and liberties&quot; were never defined, nor the means by which they would be obtained, the IRB in the Fenian tradition construed the term to mean the maintenance of the rights of Ireland to national independence and to secure that right in arms.

The manifesto further stated that their duties were to be defensive, contemplating neither &quot;aggression or domination&quot;. It said that the Tory policy in Ulster was deliberately adopted to make the threat of armed violence the decisive factor in relations between Ireland and Great Britain. If Irishmen accepted this new policy he said they would be surrendering their rights as men and citizens. If they did not attempt to defeat this policy &quot;we become politically the most degraded population in Europe and no longer worthy of the name of nation.&quot; In this situation, it said,&quot;the duty of safeguarding our own rights is our duty first and foremost. They have rights who dare maintain them.&quot; But rights, in the last resort, could only be maintained by arms.

MacNeill himself would approve of armed resistance only if the Dublin Castle administration launched a campaign of repression against Irish nationalist movements, or if they attempted to introduce conscription in Ireland due to wartime pressures; in such a case, he believed that they would have mass support.

==John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party==
While the IRB was instrumental in the establishment of the Volunteers, they were never able to gain complete control of the organisation. This was compounded after John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, took an active interest. Though some well known Redmond supporters had joined the Volunteers, the attitude of Redmond and the Party was largely one of opposition, though by the Summer of 1914, it was clear the IPP needed to control the Volunteers if they were not to be a threat to their authority. The majority of the IV members, like the nation as a whole, were supporters of Redmond (though this was not necessarily true of the organisation&#x27;s leadership), and, armed with this knowledge, Redmond sought IPP influence, if not outright control of the Volunteers. Negotiations between MacNeil and Redmond over the latter&#x27;s future role continued inconclusively for several weeks, until on 9 June Redmond issued an ultimatum, through the press, demanding the Provisional Committee co-opt twenty-five IPP nominees. With several IPP members and their supporters on the committee already, this would give them a majority of seats, and effective control.

The more moderate members of the Volunteers&#x27; Provisional Committee did not like the idea, nor the way it was presented, but they were largely prepared to go along with it to prevent Redmond from forming a rival organisation, which would draw away most of their support. The IRB was completely opposed to Redmond&#x27;s demands, as this would end any chance they had of controlling the Volunteers. Hobson, who simultaneously served in leadership roles in both the IRB and the Volunteers, was one of a few IRB members to reluctantly submit to Redmond&#x27;s demands, leading to a falling out with the IRB leaders, notably Tom Clarke. In the end the Committee accepted Redmond&#x27;s demands, by a vote of 18 to 9, most of the votes of dissent coming from members of the IRB.

The new IPP members of the committee included MP Joseph Devlin and Redmond&#x27;s son William, but were mostly composed of insignificant figures, believed to have been appointed as a reward for party loyalty. Despite their numbers, they were never able to exert control over the organisation, which largely remained with its earlier officers. Finances remained fully in the hands of the treasurer, The O&#x27;Rahilly, his assistant, Éamonn Ceannt, and MacNeill himself, who retained his position as chairman, further diminishing the IPP&#x27;s influence.

==Arming the Volunteers==

Shortly after the formation of the Volunteers, the British Parliament banned the importation of weapons into Ireland. The &quot;Curragh incident&quot; (also referred to as the &quot;Curragh Mutiny&quot;) of March 1914, indicated that the British government could not rely on its military to ensure a smooth transition to Home Rule. Then in April 1914 the Ulster Volunteers successfully imported 24,000 rifles in the Larne Gun Running event. The Irish Volunteers realised that it too would have to follow suit if they were to be taken as a serious force. Indeed, many contemporary observers commented on the irony of &quot;loyal&quot; Ulstermen arming themselves and threatening to defy the British government by force. Patrick Pearse famously replied that &quot;the Orangeman with a gun is not as laughable as the nationalist without one.&quot; Thus O&#x27;Rahilly, Sir Roger Casement and Bulmer Hobson worked together to co-ordinate a daylight gun-running expedition to Howth, just north of Dublin.

The plan worked, and Erskine Childers brought nearly 1,000 rifles, purchased from Germany, to the harbour on 26 July and distributed them to the waiting Volunteers, without interference from the authorities. The remainder of the guns smuggled from Germany for the Irish Volunteers were landed at Kilcoole a week later by Sir Thomas Myles.

As the Volunteers marched from Howth back to Dublin, however, they were met by a large patrol of the Dublin Metropolitan Police and the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers. The Volunteers escaped largely unscathed, but when the Borderers returned to Dublin they clashed with a group of unarmed civilians who had been heckling them at Bachelors Walk. Though no order was given, the soldiers fired on the civilians, killing four and further wounding 37. This enraged the populace, and during the outcry enlistments in the Volunteers soared.

==The Split==

The outbreak of World War I in August 1914 provoked a serious split in the organisation. Redmond, in the interest of ensuring the enactment of the Home Rule Act 1914 then on the statute books, encouraged the Volunteers to support the British and Allied war commitment and join Irish regiments of the British New Army divisions, an action which angered the founding members. Given the wide expectation that the war was going to be a short one, the majority however supported the war effort and the call to restore the &quot;freedom of small nations&quot; on the European continent. They left to form the National Volunteers, some of whose members fought in the 10th and 16th (Irish) Division, side by side with their Ulster Volunteer counterparts from the 36th (Ulster) Division.

A minority believed that the principles used to justify the Allied war cause were best applied in restoring the freedom to one small country in particular. They retained the name &quot;Irish Volunteers&quot;, were led by MacNeill and called for Irish neutrality. The National Volunteers kept some 175,000 members, leaving the Irish Volunteers with an estimated 13,500. However, the National Volunteers declined rapidly, and the few remaining members reunited with the Irish Volunteers in October 1917. The split proved advantageous to the IRB, which was now back in a position to control the organisation.

Following the split, the remnants of the Irish Volunteers were often, and erroneously, referred to as the &quot;Sinn Féin Volunteers&quot;, or, by the British press, derisively as &quot;Shinners&quot;, after Arthur Griffith&#x27;s political organisation Sinn Féin. Although the two organisations had some overlapping membership, there was no official connection between Griffith&#x27;s then moderate Sinn Féin and the Volunteers. The political stance of the remaining Volunteers was not always popular, and a 1,000-strong march led by Pearse through the garrison city of Limerick on Whit Sunday, 1915, was pelted with rubbish by a hostile crowd. Pearse explained the reason for the establishment of the new force when he said in May 1915: &quot;What if conscription be enforced on Ireland? What if a Unionist or a Coalition British Ministry repudiates the Home Rule Act? &lt;br&gt;What if it be determined to dismember Ireland? The future is big with these and other possibilities.&quot; 

After the departure of Redmond and his followers, the Volunteers adopted a constitution, which had been drawn up by the earlier provisional committee, and was ratified by a convention of 160 delegates on 25 October 1914. It called for general council of fifty members to meet monthly, as well as an executive of the president and eight elected members. In December a headquarters staff was appointed, consisting of Eoin MacNeill as chief of staff, The O&#x27;Rahilly as director of arms, Thomas MacDonagh as director of training, Patrick Pearse as director of military organisation, Bulmer Hobson as quartermaster, and Joseph Plunkett as director of military operations. The following year they were joined by Éamonn Ceannt as director of communications and J.J. O&#x27;Connell as chief of inspection.

This reorganisation put the IRB is a stronger position, as four important military positions (director of training, director of military organisation, director of military operations, and director of communications) were held by men who were, or would soon be, members of the IRB, and who later become four of the seven signatories of the Easter Proclamation. (Hobson was also an IRB member, but had a falling out with the leadership after he supported Redmond&#x27;s appointees to the provisional council, and hence played little role in the IRB thereafter.)

==Easter Rising, 1916==

The official stance of the Irish Volunteers was that action would only be taken if the Dublin Castle administration attempted to disarm the Volunteers, arrest their leaders, or introduce conscription to Ireland. The IRB, however, was determined to use the Volunteers for offensive action while Britain was tied up in the First World War. Their plan was to circumvent MacNeill&#x27;s command, instigating a Rising, and to get MacNeill on board once the rising was a &quot;fait accompli&quot;.

Pearse issued orders for three days of parades and manoeuvres, a thinly disguised order for a general insurrection. MacNeill soon discovered the real intent behind the orders and attempted to stop all actions by the Volunteers. He succeeded only in putting the Rising off for a day, and limiting it to about 1,000 active participants within Dublin and a very limited action elsewhere. Almost all of the fighting was confined to Dublin – though the Volunteers were involved in engagements against RIC barracks in Ashbourne, County Meath, and there were actions in Enniscorthy, County Wexford and in County Galway. The Irish Citizen Army supplied slightly more than 200 personnel for the Dublin campaign.

==Reorganisation==

Steps towards reorganising the Irish Volunteers were taken during 1917, and on 27 October 1917 a convention was held in Dublin. This convention was called to coincide with the Sinn Féin party conference. Nearly 250 people attended the convention; internment prevented many more from attending. The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) estimated that 162 companies of volunteers were active in the country, although other sources suggest a figure of 390.

The proceedings were presided over by Éamon de Valera, who had been elected President of Sinn Féin the previous day. Also on the platform were Cathal Brugha and many others who were prominent in the reorganising of the Volunteers in the previous few months, many of them ex-prisoners.

De Valera was elected president. A national executive was also elected, composed of representatives of all parts of the country. In addition, a number of directors were elected to head the various IRA departments. Those elected were: Michael Collins (Director for Organisation); Richard Mulcahy (Director of Training); Diarmuid Lynch (Director for Communications); Michael Staines (Director for Supply); Rory O&#x27;Connor (Director of Engineering). Seán McGarry was voted general secretary, while Cathal Brugha was made Chairman of the Resident Executive, which in effect made him Chief of Staff.

The other elected members were: M. W. O&#x27;Reilly (Dublin); Austin Stack (Kerry); Con Collins (Limerick); Seán MacEntee (Belfast); Joseph O&#x27;Doherty (Donegal); Paul Galligan (Cavan); Eoin O&#x27;Duffy (Monaghan); Séamus Doyle (Wexford); Peadar Bracken (Offaly); Larry Lardner (Galway); Richard Walsh (Mayo) and another member from Connacht. There were six co-options to make-up the full number when the directors were named from within their ranks. The six were all Dublin men: Eamonn Duggan; Gearóid O&#x27;Sullivan; Fintan Murphy; Diarmuid O&#x27;Hegarty; Dick McKee and Paddy Ryan.

Of the 26 elected, six were also members of the Sinn Féin National Executive, with Éamon de Valera president of both. Eleven of the 26 were elected Teachta Dála (members of the Dáil) in the 1918 general election and 13 in the May 1921 election.

==Relationship with Dáil Éireann==
Sinn Féin MPs elected in 1918 fulfilled their election promise not to take their seats in Westminster but instead set up an independent &quot;Assembly of Ireland&quot;, or &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot;, in the Irish language. In theory, the Volunteers were responsible to the Dáil and was the army of the Irish Republic. In practice, the Dáil had great difficulty controlling their actions; under their own constitution, the Volunteers were bound to obey their own executive and no other body. The fear was increased when, on the very day the new national parliament was meeting, 21 January 1919, members of the Third Tipperary Brigade led by Séumas Robinson, Seán Treacy, Dan Breen and Seán Hogan carried out the Soloheadbeg Ambush and seized a quantity of gelignite, killing two RIC constables and triggering the War of Independence. Technically, the men involved were considered to be in a serious breach of Volunteer discipline and were liable to be court-martialed, but it was considered more politically expedient to hold them up as examples of a rejuvenated militarism. The conflict soon escalated into guerrilla warfare by what were then known as the &quot;Flying Columns&quot; in remote areas. Attacks on remote RIC barracks continued throughout 1919 and 1920, forcing the police to consolidate defensively in the larger towns, effectively placing large areas of the countryside in the hands of the Republicans.

Moves to make the Volunteers the army of the Dáil and not its rival had begun before the January attack, and were stepped up. On 31 January 1919 the Volunteer organ, &quot;An tÓglách&quot; (&quot;The Volunteer&quot;) published a list of principles agreed between two representatives of the Aireacht, acting Príomh Aire Cathal Brugha and Richard Mulcahy and the Executive. It made first mention of the organisation treating &quot;the armed forces of the enemy – whether soldiers or policemen – exactly as a &quot;national army&quot; would treat the members of an invading army&quot;. In the statement the new relationship between the Aireacht and the Volunteers – who increasingly became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) – was defined clearly.
*The Government was defined as possessing the same power and authority as a normal government.
*&quot;It&quot;, and not the IRA, sanctions the IRA campaign;
*It explicitly spoke of a &quot;state of war&quot;.
As part of the ongoing strategy to take control of the IRA, Brugha proposed to Dáil Éireann on 20 August 1919 that the Volunteers were to be asked, at this next convention, to swear allegiance to the Dáil. He further proposed that members of the Dáil themselves should swear the same oath. On 25 August Collins wrote to the First minister (Príomh Aire), Éamon de Valera, to inform him &quot;the Volunteer affair is now fixed&quot;. Though it was &quot;fixed&quot; at one level, another year passed before the Volunteers took an oath of allegiance to the Irish Republic and its government, &quot;throughout August 1920&quot;.

On 11 March 1921 Dáil Éireann discussed its relationship with its army. De Valera commented that &quot;..the Dáil was hardly acting fairly by the army in not publicly taking full responsibility for all its acts.&quot; The Dáil had not yet declared war, but was at war; it voted unanimously that &quot;..they should agree to the acceptance of a state of war.&quot;

==Legacy==
All organisations calling themselves the IRA, as well as the Irish Defence Forces, have their origins in the Irish Volunteers. The Irish name of the Volunteers, Óglaigh na hÉireann, was retained when the English name changed, and is the official Irish name of the Defence Forces, as well as the various IRAs.

The name of the Bengal Volunteers, an Indian revolutionary organization founded in 1928 and active against British rule in India, may have been inspired by the Irish organization.

<text>&quot;Girl&#x27;s Not Grey&quot; is a song by American rock band AFI. It was released as the debut single from their sixth studio album, &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot; (2003), debuting on radio on February 4, 2003. It is the band&#x27;s third most successful single, peaking at No. 7 on the Alternative Songs Chart and No. 14 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Chart. David Slade directed a music video, featuring elements which have been described as similar to those in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

It is a playable track in the video games &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero Live&quot;, and a downloadable track for the video game &quot;Guitar Hero 5&quot; and the iPod Touch application &quot;Tap Tap Revenge&quot;.

==Background==
According to guitarist Jade Puget, most of the songs for &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot; had already been written by the time he wrote the music for the song in a hotel in Toronto, Ontario. Vocalist Davey Havok then wrote the lyrics, with Puget penning the background vocals. Puget later reflected that he had thought the song could have been the album opener, but he was the only band member to think so.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Girl&#x27;s Not Grey&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, who considered it a pop-punk song from the album. AllMusic reviewer Johnny Loftus felt that the chorus of the backing voices shifted the song from hardcore punk to pop, and called the single &quot;a car-radio singalong of pure genius&quot;.

==Music video==
A music video directed by David Slade was released shortly after the single&#x27;s release. According to the Fuse TV program &quot;IMX&quot;, the video is similar to Slade&#x27;s previous video for &quot;Sour Girl&quot; by Stone Temple Pilots, which also features a strange environment and human-sized rabbit characters. The concepts within the video are similar to the basic plot of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, featuring a little girl that follows a rabbit into an alternate reality.

A completely black version of the band performs in an alley, where a blue-haired girl in black clothing follows a pink human-sized rabbit through Jade Puget to an alternate reality, where the band is seen performing in full color. The location is a mostly red and pink landscape, with pink flower petals falling. The rabbit is now blue and the girl&#x27;s clothes pink, with her head now a plastic cartoon mask expressing euphoria. The girl continues to follow the rabbit to the top of a hill, where she sees the band performing. She is saddened after seeing that the rabbit has left her. She is enveloped by a whirlwind of petals, which consume her. Petals burst out of Havok&#x27;s chest, and even fall in the alley where the colorless version of the band finishes playing the song.

There is also an alternate version of the video which simply features the band performing in the alley covered in black paint but does not feature the girl, human-sized rabbits, or the alternate reality setting.

By early 2023, the rabbit suit had been donated to the Punk Rock Museum in Las Vegas, which opened on April 1 of that year.

==Live performances==

&quot;Girl&#x27;s Not Grey&quot; was first performed live on January 8, 2002, at the Forum in Inglewood, California. As of April, 1, 2019, it had been performed 538 times, making it the most performed song by AFI. In an interview with &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, drummer Adam Carson noted that the song &quot;really works as the first song in a set, which is why I think we&#x27;ve played that song probably more than anything&quot;.

<text>Jean Robert Alesi (; born Giovanni Roberto Alesi, 11 June 1964) is a French former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Alesi won the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix with Ferrari. 

Born and raised in Avignon, Alesi started karting aged 16 with a desire to eventually compete in rallying. He progressed to open-wheel racing aged 20, winning the French Formula Three Championship in 1987 and graduating to International Formula 3000. His subsequent title with Jordan in 1989 led to a Formula One drive with Tyrrell, replacing Michele Alboreto from the 1989 French Grand Prix onwards, where he finished fourth. Alesi scored his maiden podium at the opening round of the season, repeating this feat in Monaco. He signed for Ferrari in to partner Alain Prost, scoring several podiums across five seasons before taking his sole victory at the in . He left at the end of the season after twice finishing fifth in the standings, swapping seats with Michael Schumacher in to join Benetton, where he scored 13 podiums across two seasons. He spent a further two seasons with Sauber—scoring his only podium for the team at the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix—before joining Prost. He remained at Prost until , when he joined Jordan from the onwards and retired at the conclusion of the season. During his time in Formula One, Alesi was noted for his ability in wet weather, as well as being a mercurial and passionate racer. Alesi holds the joint-record for most podium finishes before first win (15).

After leaving Formula One, Alesi raced full-time in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters from 2002 to 2006, winning several races. Alesi then competed in the all-star Speedcar Series in both of its seasons, as well as entering the 24 Hours of Le Mans in and the Indianapolis 500 in 2012, before retiring from motor racing in 2012. Since 2013, he has been an ambassador for Pirelli. Alesi was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 2006.

==Early life and career==
Alesi was born Giovanni Roberto Alesi on 11 June 1964 in the southern French town of Avignon, Vaucluse, between Montpellier and Marseille to Sicilian parents. His father, Franco, was from Alcamo, Sicily, and his mother was from Riesi. His father ran an automotive bodywork repair garage in the town, where Alesi spent much of his formative years and developed a love of cars. In addition to spending time in the family garage, Alesi&#x27;s father also provided his first taste of motorsport, being a keen amateur competitor in rallying and hillclimb events. On weekends that he was unable to compete he would sometimes lend his rally cars to family friend and future Monte Carlo Rally-winning professional rally driver Jean Ragnotti, who would commonly return them &quot;destroyed&quot;.

Starting his career with a passion for rallying rather than racing, he took up karting at the age of 16 and then graduated to cars in 1983 by entering the French Renault 5 Turbo championship, where he raced for two seasons. He won the 1987 French Formula 3 title before moving up to International Formula 3000 in 1988. The 1988 season was a disappointment, finishing tenth in the championship with two podium finishes, not helped by problems within the team. However, in 1989 he joined the Jordan Formula 3000 team and won the championship. Both crowns were after duels with his rival Érik Comas. In 1989 Alesi tied on points for the F3000 title with Comas, but won the title on number of wins, having scored three to Comas&#x27; two. Made the strong start with a street Ferrari F40 LM in Laguna Seca IMSA GTO race. Surprisingly led for six laps and finished third overall, ahead of most experienced drivers in race-spec cars. He also raced in the Le Mans 24 hours in the same year, but a fire forced him to retire in the fourth hour of the race.

==Formula One career==

===Tyrrell (1989–1990)===
While Alesi was seen as a talent of the future, his start as a Formula One driver was somewhat fortuitous. Prior to the 1989 French Grand Prix, Ken Tyrrell had signed a deal to run Camel cigarette sponsorship on his previously unsponsored cars. However this caused problems for Michele Alboreto who was personally sponsored by rival cigarette brand Marlboro. The sponsorship clash forced Tyrrell to release Alboreto and find another driver. The team decided to look at whoever was leading International Formula 3000 at the time, and Alesi was signed as the replacement.

Alesi debuted in the 1989 French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard in a Tyrrell-Ford and finished fourth, having run as high as second during the race. Ken Tyrrell was sufficiently impressed to give him an eighteen-month contract. He drove most of the rest of the season for Tyrrell while continuing his successful Formula 3000 campaign, occasionally giving the car up in favour of Johnny Herbert when Formula 3000 clashed, scoring points again at the Italian and Spanish Grands Prix.

With Jonathan Palmer having retired from driving at the end of 1989 and a new teammate in Satoru Nakajima, Alesi amazingly became Tyrrell&#x27;s lead driver in 1990 for what would be his first full year in Grand Prix racing (prior to the start of the 1990 season, Alesi only had 8 race starts in Formula One). At the first event, the United States Grand Prix at Phoenix, he led for 25 laps in front of Ayrton Senna with a car powered by a customer Ford V8 considered as vastly inferior to the factory-developed Honda V10 in Senna&#x27;s McLaren, and also re-passing Senna after the Brazilian had first overtaken for the lead, before ultimately finishing second. Second place in the Monaco Grand Prix followed, and by mid-season top teams were clamouring for his services in 1991. A confused situation erupted, with Tyrrell, Williams, and Ferrari all claiming to have signed the driver within a very short period. The results dropped away during the rest of the 1990 season, and Alesi finished ninth in the championship, with 13 points.

There were signs of Alesi&#x27;s talent in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza where he qualified the under powered Tyrrell in 5th place less than a second slower than Senna&#x27;s pole time. At both the original and restart (caused by Derek Warwick&#x27;s Lotus crashing heavily), Alesi passed the more powerful V12 Ferrari of reigning World Champion Alain Prost for 3rd place and within a lap would be harrying McLaren&#x27;s Gerhard Berger for 2nd. On lap 5, though, he spun into the barriers at the Rettifilo chicane.

===Ferrari (1991–1995)===
====1991====

Alesi initially signed a contract with Williams for the 1991 season. However due to Williams delaying the announcement of his signature with the reasoning eventually given they were pursuing Ayrton Senna, Alesi eventually grew tired of the constant delays, as a result he then opted instead to sign for Ferrari as the second driver alongside fellow countryman Alain Prost, and the Ferrari team had to pay Williams a fine of four million dollars. The move to Ferrari initially appeared to be a logical choice from a results perspective too, for Alain Prost had mounted a serious world championship challenge at Ferrari the previous year, and the 1991 Ferrari set good lap times in winter testing.

He had third-place finishes at Monaco, Germany and Portugal, and finished in the top six at Brazil, France, Hungary and Spain (despite a stop and go penalty for a jump start in the Spanish Grand Prix). The 1991 Ferrari also turned out to be unreliable, and he had nine retirements during the season, including a mechanical failure while leading the Belgian Grand Prix. Having a dismal 1991 season, Alesi&#x27;s teammate Prost was sacked after the Japanese Grand Prix when he publicly described the car as a &quot;truck&quot; and took a year-long sabbatical from racing, and thus Alesi became the team&#x27;s number one driver for 1992. Alesi scored 21 points and finished seventh in the championship.

====1992====
Alesi was partnered by Ivan Capelli in 1992, when the Ferrari F92A was even further from the pace than the 1991 Ferrari. Capelli had a disastrous season and was replaced for the last two races by Nicola Larini. Alesi had no realistic hope of winning a race, and retired with engine failure in the first two races of the season, but he finished fourth in the third race of the season, behind the Williams drivers and Michael Schumacher. He finished third in the Spanish Grand Prix, after a strong wet-weather drive, in spite of making contact with Gerhard Berger and Mika Hakkinen during the race. He ran third at the San Marino Grand Prix, but retired following a collision with Gerhard Berger. The subsequent races brought a series of retirements, although Alesi had a strong third-place finish at Canada and produced another outstanding wet-weather drive in France, producing lap times on slicks that were comparable to those of Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Williams, before retiring with another engine failure. In the Belgian Grand Prix he was given the F92A / T, an improvement over the previous model, but retired due to a collision with Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Williams. He qualified a strong third at Monza, but retired with a fuel pump failure early in the race. He finished in the points during the last two races of the season, leaving him seventh in the championship with 18 points.

====1993====
Alesi was joined by Austrian Gerhard Berger in 1993 who was returning to Maranello after three seasons with McLaren. The Ferrari F93A was very slow during pre-season testing. Mainly due to the unreliability of the &quot;active&quot; suspension of the F93A, there came four retirements in the first five races of the season and an eighth-place finish at Brazil, causing Alesi to even consider leaving Ferrari. However, he finished third in the Monaco Grand Prix, and in July, he signed a further two-year contract with Ferrari. However, subsequent races continued to feature frequent retirements and finishes outside of the points. In Hungary he had a collision with Christian Fittipaldi, resulting in a leg contusion, and came close to having a brawl with him afterwards. The Ferrari improved towards the end of the season, and Alesi finished second at Monza and then led early in the race at Portugal, eventually finishing fourth. Alesi finished sixth in the championship with 16 points.

====1994====
In 1994, the Ferrari was far more competitive, but marred by unreliability, and team-mate Berger became established as the team leader. After finishing third in the first race of the season, Alesi injured his back after a testing accident at Mugello circuit in Italy after the first race of the season (Brazil) and was replaced in the Pacific Grand Prix and the San Marino Grand Prix by Nicola Larini. He returned with a fifth place in Monaco and finished a strong third in Canada, but almost lost the position at the end of the race due to a gearbox problem. He retired in the French Grand Prix due to a collision with Rubens Barrichello, but finished second in the British Grand Prix, thanks to the disqualification of Michael Schumacher, and was looking set for a strong result in the German Grand Prix, qualifying second behind team-mate Berger, but his engine failed on the first lap. Subsequent races were marked by a series of retirements. At Monza, he took his first pole position and led until his first pit stop, when his gearbox failed in the pitlane, and in anger, he drove back to Avignon at speeds in excess of 200 km/h. This streak finally ended at Japan, when he finished third after a duel with Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Williams, and then he finished sixth at Australia. Alesi finished fifth in the championship with 24 points.

====1995====

The Ferrari improved further in 1995 and Alesi achieved better results, although the pace of the Ferrari fell back during the second half of the season. He finished fifth at Brazil, followed by second places at Argentina and Imola. He retired from second place at the Spanish Grand Prix due to an engine failure, and at the Monaco Grand Prix, again while running second, Martin Brundle&#x27;s Ligier spun in front of him, leaving him nowhere to go and causing him to crash. However, at the Canadian Grand Prix, on his 31st birthday, he won his first and only race, helped by Michael Schumacher encountering mechanical problems with ten laps to go. Alesi was unaware that he was in the lead for some time, as the mechanics didn&#x27;t have enough time to put out his new position. Alesi realized what happened after he saw people getting up in the stands. Ferrari confirmed it with a P1 panel as he was passing through the pit lane. Overwhelmed by emotions, when Alesi was braking into Turn 1, he had tears in his eyes, making it difficult to drive in the right line. His Ferrari ran out of fuel after crossing the finish line and so got a lift back to the pits off Michael Schumacher. This broke the record for the largest number of consecutive races without a win for a Ferrari driver (67) which was subsequently exceeded by Felipe Massa in 2013. He finished second at the British Grand Prix, but then suffered four consecutive retirements, and was devastated prior to the Hungarian Grand Prix when hearing that he had lost his Ferrari drive to Michael Schumacher. He retired from the lead four laps into the Belgian Grand Prix due to a suspension failure, and retired from the lead again at the Italian Grand Prix, seven laps from the end, due to a rear wheel problem. He had a heated argument with Jean Todt after the Portuguese Grand Prix due to refusing to obey team orders to defer to team-mate Gerhard Berger in spite of having more points in the championship. At the European Grand Prix Alesi led for most of the race due to fast laps on slick tyres in damp conditions, but was passed by Michael Schumacher two laps from the end, hindered by low fuel and trouble progressing through lapped traffic. After a fifth place in the Pacific Grand Prix, he produced an outstanding wet-weather drive in Japan, making a powerful comeback after being angered by a stop-go penalty for a jump start that he felt he did not commit, but then retired with a driveshaft failure, and he crashed into Michael Schumacher in his final race for Ferrari at Australia. He finished fifth in the drivers&#x27; championship, with 42 points.

===Benetton (1996–1997)===
====1996====
When Benetton&#x27;s Michael Schumacher joined Ferrari in 1996, Alesi and teammate Gerhard Berger swapped places with him, with Berger not happy to be the number two to Schumacher at Ferrari. Though Benetton were the defending constructors&#x27; champions, they were about to experience a lull in form like Ferrari in 1991. Many team personnel had decided to leave for Ferrari with Michael Schumacher, and chief designer Rory Byrne decided to take a year out. The 1996 Benetton was fairly successful but slower than the Williams, and lost competitiveness through the season, lacking effective developments to the car, while the Ferrari improved as the season progressed, resulting in Schumacher overtaking Alesi in the drivers&#x27; championship. His season began with a collision with the Ferrari of Eddie Irvine, but two podiums followed. After a bad start due to the car&#x27;s braking system, he collided with Mika Salo in the fourth race of the season and he and team-mate Berger were summoned by team boss Flavio Briatore, and they were told, &#x27;No more errors&#x27;, and this generated tension within the team. After a sixth place at Imola, he was leading the Monaco Grand Prix but retired due to a broken suspension. He then had five podium finishes, sandwiching a retirement at the British Grand Prix after having run in second place. At the Italian Grand Prix, following the retirement of Damon Hill, he led until the pit stops, when he was overtaken by Michael Schumacher, who had a better race strategy. After a fourth place at Portugal and retirement in the last race, Alesi finished fourth in the drivers&#x27; championship with 47 points, the best result of his career.

====1997====
At the start of the 1997 season, Alesi was given an ultimatum from Flavio Briatore, warning him that 1997 would be his last chance to get good results. The car produced good results in pre-season testing, but Ross Brawn, Nigel Stepney and Rory Byrne joined Schumacher at Ferrari, and the Benetton&#x27;s form during the season was erratic. His cause was not helped by an embarrassing retirement in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in when he ignored several radio messages from the pit mechanics to come in for his pit stop, and continued for five laps until running out of fuel and was criticised by Briatore, who felt he had wasted a chance of a podium finish. He only scored three points in the following four races, but then had a strong run with some podiums, moving up into third place in the drivers&#x27; championship. However, there were further embarrassing incidents, such as at the French Grand Prix when he needlessly pushed David Coulthard off the track, and the Austrian Grand Prix, where his attempt to outbrake Eddie Irvine from nearly eight lengths behind caused a collision that saw Alesi placed under investigation for dangerous driving after the race. He took pole position at the Italian Grand Prix which sent the fans into raptures despite the fact that he no longer drove for Ferrari and led early in the race but lost out to David Coulthard&#x27;s McLaren due to a slow pit stop. He finished fourth in the championship with 36 points, thanks to the disqualification of Michael Schumacher at the end of the season. Alesi&#x27;s reputation was damaged during his spell at Benetton, having failed to win a Grand Prix despite having had a competitive car, and suffered by comparison with Schumacher at Ferrari. Alesi&#x27;s contract with Benetton was not renewed at the end of the season and he signed a two-year contract with Sauber.

===Sauber (1998–1999)===
====1998====
Alesi moved on to the Swiss team Sauber, and was paired with Johnny Herbert and they went on to form the most experienced driver line-up for the 1998 season. The car was equipped with Ferrari engines from 1997, which were evolved from Petronas. Although Alesi&#x27;s results declined relative to previous years, his reputation improved again, for he put in many strong performances that masked the deficiencies of his Sauber. He had a poor first race of the season in Melbourne, which ended in an engine failure, and a ninth place in Brazil, but he showed good form in the 1998 Grand Prix of Argentina, finishing fifth despite a pit stop problem early in the race. He finished sixth at Imola, but then was plagued by unreliability during the middle part of the season, despite often running in points-scoring positions, including a retirement from fourth place near the end of the Monaco Grand Prix, and being hit by Heinz-Harald Frentzen while running in sixth during the French Grand Prix, and a hydraulic failure forced him to retire after running fourth during the British Grand Prix. He qualified on the front row at the Austrian Grand Prix, but a collision with Giancarlo Fisichella forced him to retire. He achieved the last podium of his career at the rain-soaked Belgian Grand Prix, behind the Jordans of Damon Hill and Ralf Schumacher. He also scored points at the Italian Grand Prix, and finished in eleventh place in the drivers&#x27; championship with nine points, comprehensively beating team-mate Johnny Herbert.

====1999====

The 1999 Sauber was slower and less reliable than the previous year&#x27;s, and he had to retire immediately in the first Grand Prix of the season, and also retired in the Brazilian Grand Prix, albeit after having worked his way up to 5th position from 21st on the grid. His first points came in the third race of the season, with a sixth-place finish. At the Canadian Grand Prix he was angered by an incident with Jarno Trulli and, despite the good relationship between the two drivers, accused Trulli of not behaving as a professional driver. He had several other retirements following some good qualifying performances including a front row position at the French Grand Prix, thanks to a wet qualifying session. During the summer, he was named as a possible replacement for Eddie Irvine as the number two Ferrari driver alongside Michael Schumacher, and Schumacher said that he would be happy to have Alesi in the team Ferrari opted to sign Rubens Barrichello for the second seat, closing the door on a possible return for Alesi. Eventually, he signed for Prost Grand Prix and accused the engineers of Sauber of not developing the car or following the advice of the drivers. Shortly before the Hungarian Grand Prix, Alesi had an accident that caused bruises to his right leg and almost caused him to miss the race, but he did take part. He had another sixth place at the last race of the season, leaving him sixteenth in the championship with two points.

===Prost and Jordan (2000–2001)===

For the 2000 season, Alesi moved on to join Prost, which was owned by his former Ferrari teammate and four time World Drivers&#x27; Champion Alain Prost, after Prost had bought the Ligier team in early 1997 and renamed it. However, the car was very slow and unreliable. He was hit by a billboard in qualifying for the Brazilian Grand Prix, resulting in an accident, but came out unscathed. He failed to score a single point during the season, for the first time in his career. Late in the season, he criticised the car and the Peugeot engines, so much so that in the French Grand Prix, the technicians of the Transalpine went on strike for five minutes. A bad accident in the German Grand Prix threatened his ability to race at the subsequent Grand Prix in Hungary, but he was able to take part.

In 2001 the Prost car was reliable and he finished every race that he drove for the Prost team. He got into a points-scoring position at the wet Brazilian Grand Prix but his tyres went off and consequently he dropped to eighth place. Alesi scored his first points since the 1999 season at the Monaco Grand Prix, with a sixth place, and then finished fifth at the Canadian Grand Prix. A dispute after the British Grand Prix, however, saw Alesi walk out after the German Grand Prix, where he scored a point. This was because German driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen was suddenly sacked by Jordan after the British Grand Prix and needed a drive. He joined the Prost team, and Alesi joined Jordan. Alesi was fined and criticised by Prost, who had given him a two-year contract and did not want to lose his number one driver.

Alesi first raced for Prost in 2001. Alesi ended his open-wheel career in 2001 with Jordan. Alesi had driven for Jordan in Formula 3000 when he won the championship in 1989. He drove the remaining five races of 2001 for Jordan, scoring his last Formula one points in Belgium by finishing sixth. Alesi made his 200th Formula One start in 2001 United States Grand Prix and finished his F1 career at the 2001 Japanese Grand Prix, where he retired after colliding with Kimi Räikkönen on lap 5. However, he was generally outpaced by team-mate Jarno Trulli, and the team opted to take on Takuma Sato instead for 2002. Although Alesi was offered a drive with Arrows, he did not want to race for another season in an uncompetitive car, and so decided to retire from Formula One.

==Later career==
===Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (2002–2006)===

In March 2002, Alesi – who was set to drive for Mercedes that season in DTM – was recruited by McLaren to work on tyre development, managing 224 laps over three days at Paul Ricard in a 2001-spec McLaren-Mercedes MP4-16B, before staying on to have a run in his new Merc CLK-DTM racer.

Alesi tested again for McLaren at Mugello in April that same year, putting 90 laps on the board, and was in discussions to become the team&#x27;s official test driver. It never happened, with Alesi going on to spend five seasons in the DTM with Mercedes instead, and later holding F1-related ambassadorial roles with both Lotus and Pirelli.

===DTM 2002–2006===
After Formula One, Alesi raced in the German Touring Car Championship, where he placed fifth in the 2002 championship for Mercedes with one victory. He repeated this in 2003 but this time scoring two victories. In 2004 he finished seventh in the championship scoring no victories. In 2005 he won the opening race and went on to take seventh place in the standings once more. He retired from the DTM after finishing the 2006 season in 9th place.

===Speedcar Series (2008–2009)===
Alesi joined a number of other ex-Formula One drivers (Christian Danner, Johnny Herbert, Stefan Johansson, Ukyo Katayama, JJ Lehto, Gianni Morbidelli, Jacques Villeneuve and Alex Yoong) in the inaugural season of the Far &amp; Middle Eastern Speedcar Series. He won two races and finished 4th in the championship. He finished fifth in the second and last season of Speedcar Series after taking two wins in 2009.

===Le Mans Series (2010)===
On 13 October 2009, Alesi tested an AF Corse Ferrari F430 GT2 at Maranello, on the same day that Felipe Massa drove an F1 car for the first time after his accident in Hungary earlier in the year. After the test, which lasted just 65 laps, Alesi was enthusiastic and Amato Ferrari talked about Alesi&#x27;s possible involvement in the 2010 programme.

Early in 2010 it was announced that Alesi would be the team-mate of another ex-F1 Ferrari driver, Giancarlo Fisichella, in the Le Mans Series GT2 class in Ferrari&#x27;s AF Corse team. In the first two races Alesi and his team-mates Fisichella and Finn Toni Vilander finished on the podium. Alesi, Fisichella and Vilander raced in the Le Mans 24 h race for AF Corse and finished 4th in their class. In the third race of the season in Algarve the trio finished in second position and at the Hungaroring they finished in fourth place. They finished second in the championship.

===Indianapolis 500 (2012)===
In April 2012, Alesi announced his intent to race in the 2012 Indianapolis 500 with a Lotus engine. Deals with former IZOD IndyCar Series team Newman/Haas Racing fell through, and HVM Racing owner Keith Wiggins said that his team didn&#x27;t have the funding to run Alesi in the 500. However, Firestone Indy Lights team Fan Force United agreed to field Alesi in the 500 where he qualified 33rd. His Lotus-powered car, along with that of fellow Lotus driver Simona de Silvestro, was so severely underpowered as to be unable to maintain sufficient pace in the race, and both were forced to park their cars after less than a dozen completed laps.

On 18 December 2012, Alesi unofficially announced his intention to quit racing when, in an interview with L&#x27;Equipe, he conceded that for next year he had given up on finding the sponsorship required for a second attempt.

==Driver profile==

===Driving style===
During his spell at Ferrari from 1991 to 1995, his aggressive driving style, combined with the use of the number 27 on his car, led to comparisons with Gilles Villeneuve.

===Helmet===
His helmet is white with black and red lines going down on the front side of the helmet with his name written, being an homage to Elio de Angelis, in addition to a deep blue top section. In 1999, his helmet changed from white to silver, owing to one of Sauber&#x27;s sponsors being Red Bull.

==Other ventures==

Alesi was an active spokesman for the Direxiv team in their bid for entry to the 2008 Formula 1 series. It was planned as a McLaren B Team with backing and engines from Mercedes. However, the proposal was beaten to the final grid place by Prodrive.

In January 2011, along with the launch of their new car, Lotus Renault GP announced that they had hired Alesi as an ambassador for the team and test driver for the T125 single-seater project.

<doc id="341559" wikidata="Q1928413" url="?curid=341559" title="Poundbury">
<text>Poundbury is an experimental urban extension on the western outskirts of Dorchester in the county of Dorset, England. The development is led by the Duchy of Cornwall, and had the keen endorsement of King Charles III when he was Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall. Under the direction of its lead architect and planner Léon Krier, its design is based on traditional architecture and New Urbanist philosophy. The 2021 census showed a population of 4,100.

Due for completion in 2025, it is expected to house a population of 6,000. There are 2,000 people in more than 180 businesses engaged in its development and construction. Poundbury has been praised for reviving the low-rise streetscape built to the human scale and for echoing traditional local design features, but it has not reduced car use, as originally intended. A 2022 report said: &quot;Poundbury has been highlighted for its pedestrian and public transport links and not being as &#x27;car-based&#x27; as other developments across the country.&quot;

==Mission==
Poundbury has been built according to the principles of Charles III, who is known for holding strong views challenging post-war trends in town planning that were suburban in character. Since starting in 1993, the town has received both criticism and praise from architects and design critics.

The development is built to a high-density urban pattern, intent on creating an integrated community of shops, businesses, and private and social housing; there is no zoning. The planners claim they are designing the development around people rather than the car and aim to provide a high-quality environment. To avoid constant construction, utilities are buried in common utility ducts under the town. Common areas are maintained by a management company to which all residents belong. It consists of 35 percent social housing and is designed for sustainable development, which includes carbon neutrality.

To some degree, the project shows similarities with the contemporary New Urbanism movement. The development brief outlined having a centre built in a classical style and outer neighbourhood areas in a vernacular style, with design influences derived from the surrounding area. The development includes period features such as wrought iron fences, porticos, gravelled public squares, and &#x27;bricked-up&#x27; windows; known as blind windows, these traditionally serve an aesthetic function and are widely misattributed to the window tax.

==History==
In 1987, the land was included in the West Dorset District Council local plan as a preferred location for development to expand the town of Dorchester. Charles III, the then-Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall, had already taken an interest in architecture and urban design, and was writing his book &quot;A Vision of Britain: A Personal View of Architecture&quot;. Seeing an opportunity to put the Prince of Wales&#x27;s ideas into practice, the Duchy of Cornwall chose to lead on planning the development itself, rather than sell the land to an established housebuilder. Driehaus Prize-winning New Classical architect Léon Krier was hired in 1988 to design the development.

Construction commenced in 1993, and is expected to be complete around 2025, with the north-west quadrant being the last built. The final configuration is projected to support approximately 5,800 people.

Greetings card entrepreneur Andrew Brownsword sponsored the £1 million development of the market hall at Poundbury, designed by John Simpson and based on early designs, particularly the one in Tetbury.

In June 2023, King Charles III and Queen Camilla visited Poundbury for the first time since their coronation in May. During their visit they unveiled bronze reliefs of themselves on a plinth located at Queen Mother Square and inaugurated the Duke of Edinburgh Garden where they also unveiled a bust of the King&#x27;s father Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.

==Economy and employment==

In 2010, Poundbury increased Dorset&#x27;s county local economy contributing over £330 million; it is expected to contribute £500 million in the next 15 years.

In 2010, more than 2,000 Poundbury residents were working in 180 local businesses. In 2017, the number of businesses increased to 185, providing 2,345 jobs. Businesses include a Waitrose store, a technical company which produces parts for aeroplane wings, and a chocolate factory.

One notable local employer is the breakfast food manufacturer and exporter Dorset Cereals, which since 2000 has employed more than 100 people at its purpose-built barn factory. Dorset Cereals moved to another location in Dorset in 2019. Reportedly there is space for about 80 additional businesses.

==Education ==
Poundbury has two primary schools in the catchment area: The Prince of Wales and Damers First School. The latter was an existing school in Dorchester, but in 2017 relocated to Poundbury where a new school building was constructed.

==Demographics==
The 2021 national census showed a population of 4,100. 
In 2021, 89.5% of the population was born in the United Kingdom and 10.5% born outside.
The ethnic makeup of the town in 2021 was 93.7% White (White British or White Other), 2.4% Asian, 0.9% Black, 2.6% Mixed or of multiple ethnic groups and 0.4% of other ethnic group.

==Attractions and landmarks==

Due to Poundbury&#x27;s unique appearance and plan, the town has been visited by architects, government officials, planners, housebuilders, and developers from around the world.

The Queen Mother Square is surrounded by tourist attractions, such as Strathmore House, named in honour of King Charles&#x27; grandmother Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother&#x27;s paternal heritage. In 2016, the Queen Mother statue was unveiled at the square by Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Also in 2016, a pub named the Duchess of Cornwall Inn was opened in honour of the wife of Charles III (then Prince of Wales), Queen Camilla.

Every year in August, the Dorset Food &amp; Arts Festival is held at Queen Mother Square attracting thousands of people. The festival showcases the town&#x27;s fine produce and arts and also raises money for charities.

In 2018, the Prince of Wales officially opened Poundbury&#x27;s first church, the Dorchester Community Church.

In May 2022, the Prince of Wales formally opened a huge play area in Poundbury&#x27;s largest park, the Great Field. The Great Field is now a park under the care of Dorchester Town Council.

== Politics ==
Poundbury has two tiers of local government: the Dorchester civil parish and above that the Dorset unitary authority. The Dorchester Poundbury ward elects one member to Dorset Council, and four of the 20 members of Dorchester&#x27;s town council.

For elections to the House of Commons, Poundbury is part of the West Dorset constituency. The current Member of Parliament (MP) is Edward Morello of the Liberal Democrats.

==Reception==

Poundbury&#x27;s street plan and aesthetics have been variously praised and criticised by several commentators. Writing in &quot;Architect&quot; magazine, Professor Witold Rybczynski said that &quot;Poundbury embodies social, economic, and planning innovations that can only be called radical.&quot; Poundbury was intended to reduce car dependency and encourage walking, cycling, and public transport. A survey conducted at the end of the first phase, however, showed that car use was higher in Poundbury than in the surrounding (rural) former district of West Dorset; but a 2022 report said &quot;Poundbury has been highlighted for its pedestrian and public transport links and not being as &#x27;car-based&#x27; as other developments across the country.&quot;

Among the critics, Stephen Bayley described it as &quot;fake, heartless, authoritarian and grimly cute&quot;. In 2009, Dorchester Fire Station, designed by Calderpeel Architects, was shortlisted for the Carbuncle Cup award for ugly buildings. According to Simon Jenkins, &quot;Many architects felt Poundbury was a comment on their failings – as it was – and deploring it became a badge of honour&quot;.

Nonetheless, the project has also received praise. In 2013, on the 20th anniversary of the project, the New Urbanist publication &quot;Better Cities and Towns&quot; wrote that it was &quot;winning converts&quot;. A few years later, British architecture and design critic Oliver Wainwright of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Poundbury, the Prince of Wales&#x27;s traditionalist village in Dorset, has long been mocked as a feudal Disneyland. But a growing and diverse community suggests it&#x27;s getting a lot of things right.&quot; He argued that its main success was achieving genuine mixed-use development. Jenkins argued that while Poundbury had been &quot;initially ersatz and frigid&quot;, it had &quot;matured&quot; and been more successful than earlier new towns. Countering criticisms of Poundbury&#x27;s aesthetics, English philosopher Sir Roger Scruton praised the town for its commitment to pre-modern architectural and planning principles. In the BBC documentary &quot;Why Beauty Matters&quot;, Scruton exclaimed that &quot;the proportions [of Poundbury] are human proportions; the details are restful to the eye. This is not great or original architecture, nor does it try to be; it is a modest attempt to get things right by following patterns and examples laid down by tradition. This is not nostalgia, but knowledge passed on from age to age.&quot;

<doc id="341560" wikidata="Q172854" url="?curid=341560" title="Martin Brundle">
<text>Martin John Brundle (born 1 June 1959) is a British former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . In endurance racing, Brundle won the World Sportscar Championship in 1988 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans in , both with Jaguar; he also won the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1988 with Jaguar. Since retiring from racing, Brundle has been a commentator for ITV, the BBC, and Sky.

Born and raised in King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, Brundle began competed in grass track racing aged 12 in a self-built Ford Anglia, before moving into Hot Rod racing. After several seasons in the British Saloon Car Championship, Brundle progressed to British Formula Three in 1982. He finished runner-up to Ayrton Senna the following season amidst a close title battle separated by nine points. Both drivers progressed to Formula One in , with Brundle joining Tyrrell and making his debut at the , where he finished fifth. He took his maiden podium at the , but would later be disqualified from the season&#x27;s results after the discovery of a technical infringement on the Tyrrell 012. Despite another non-classified championship finish in , Brundle retained his seat at Tyrrell and scored his first credited points with another fifth place at the 1986 Brazilian Grand Prix. Brundle signed for Zakspeed in , but left after one season to join Jaguar in sportscar racing, whom he had already won several races for in the European Touring Car Championship. Brundle won the World Sportscar Championship in record-breaking fashion that season, as well as the 24 Hours of Daytona.

Brundle returned to Formula One in with Brabham, having already stood in for Nigel Mansell at Williams for the 1988 Belgian Grand Prix. He split his two seasons at Brabham with another season at Jaguar, this time winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans, driving the Jaguar XJR-12. Brundle joined Benetton in to partner Michael Schumacher, achieving five podium finishes and finishing a career-best sixth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. He scored a further podium with Ligier at the in , before moving to McLaren for . Brundle finished seventh in the championship for the second successive season with McLaren, with a season-best second place at the . He returned to Ligier in , competing at most Grands Prix and achieving another podium in Belgium. Brundle retired from Formula One at the end of his season with Jordan, having achieved nine podiums across 12 seasons.

Upon retiring from motor racing, Brundle moved into commentary, working as an analyst on Formula One coverage for ITV Sport (1997–2008), BBC Sport (2009–2011) and Sky Sports F1 (2012–present), the latter of which was the official global broadcast until 2022. In rallying, he competed in the Rally of Great Britain in 1999. His son Alex is also a racing driver, who won the 2016 European Le Mans Series in the LMP3 class. Brundle was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2025 New Year Honours.

==Career==
===Early racing career ===

Brundle had an unorthodox route to Formula One. He began his racing career at the age of 12, competing in grass track racing in a self-built Ford Anglia, in the Norfolk village of Pott Row. In 1975, he moved to Hot Rod racing and received &#x27;Star grade&#x27; status. In 1979, he started single seater racing in Formula Ford. During this time, he also raced Tom Walkinshaw&#x27;s BMW touring cars, during which he finished second against a field of international drivers at Snetterton. He won the BMW championship in 1980, and partnered Stirling Moss in the TWR-run BP/Audi team during the 1981 British Saloon Car Championship season. In 1982, he moved up to Formula Three achieving five pole positions and two wins in his debut season. He won the Grovewood Award as the most promising Commonwealth driver. The following year, he competed with Ayrton Senna for the Formula Three championship, which Brundle lost on the final laps of the last race. In 1984, he was offered a Formula One entry.

===Formula One (1984–1987)===
His Formula One career began with the Tyrrell Racing Organisation in . He put in a number of aggressive and fast drives, finishing fifth in his first race in Brazil and then second in Detroit before being disqualified. At the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix, Brundle broke his ankles and both feet in a crash during a practice session, and was forced to miss the rest of the season while he recuperated; the severity of the damage to Brundle&#x27;s left ankle initially led doctors to consider amputating his left foot. While Brundle did recover, the damage would leave him with permanent injuries, preventing him from running and left-foot braking. Later in the year, Tyrrell were disqualified from the World Championship due to a technical infringement and Brundle&#x27;s achievements for that season were wiped from the record books.For the next two seasons he remained with Tyrrell, and despite the team&#x27;s switch from the Cosworth DFV to the turbocharged Renault engines in mid-, the team struggled against the works teams. He scored only eight points in his time with Tyrrell, all in the season. In he left Tyrrell and moved to the struggling West German team Zakspeed, but scored only two points during the year; both were scored for finishing fifth at the 1987 San Marino Grand Prix. The Zakspeed 871 car was unable to compete with the front runners. The two points scored by Brundle in 1987 were the only points the Zakspeed team scored in their five-year (1985–89) run in Formula One. Ironically, the driver he replaced at Zakspeed, fellow Englishman Jonathan Palmer, would join Tyrrell in 1987 who were once again using a Cosworth engine. While Brundle only had one point scoring finish for the season, Palmer would go on to score six World Championship points for Tyrrell and would also win the Jim Clark Cup as the &#x27;Atmo Champion&#x27; for drivers of cars with naturally aspirated engines.

===Sportscars and Brabham (1988–1991)===
Four years of Formula One racing for underfunded teams led Brundle to seek a new challenge, and thus in 1988 he took a year out. Brundle had been associated with Jaguar since 1983, when he drove TWR-prepared Jaguar XJS touring cars in the European Touring Car Championship. From his two starts with the Jaguar team Brundle took two victories, the second in partnership with TWR owner Tom Walkinshaw. When Jaguar decided to return to the World Sportscar Championship and the American IMSA championship, in partnership with TWR, Walkinshaw chose Brundle as his lead driver. The team performed well in the 1988 World Sportscar Championship season, and Brundle won the world sportscar title with a record points haul. He also won the Daytona 24 Hours the same year. He became the test driver for Williams and stood in for Nigel Mansell at the 1988 Belgian Grand Prix, after Mansell was struck down with chickenpox. Brundle was to have driven Mansell&#x27;s Williams-Judd again at the next race at Monza in Italy but prior IMSA commitments with TWR saw the drive go to fellow World Sportscar Championship contender Jean-Louis Schlesser instead (as no WSC race clashed with the Italian GP). Schlesser would infamously be involved in the incident which caused the retirement of McLaren&#x27;s Ayrton Senna late in the race, handing the win to Ferrari&#x27;s Gerhard Berger and causing McLaren&#x27;s only loss of the season.

In he returned to Formula One full-time with the returning Brabham team who would be running the Judd V8 engine. But while the former champions were initially competitive, with Brundle running third at Monaco until a flat battery forced him to pit for a replacement while his teammate Stefano Modena finishing third, Brabham were unable to recapture their early past success and Brundle, who had failed to pre-qualify for both the Canadian and French races during the season opted to move back into the sports car arena for 1990. His 1990 24 Hours of Le Mans victory rejuvenated his career, but still a top-line race seat in Formula One eluded him. As well as contesting races in sports prototypes, Brundle also contested the American IROC series in 1990. He took victory at the temporary circuit at Burke Lakefront Airport (the only IROC victory for a British driver) and finished third in the overall standings. In 1991 he rejoined Brabham, but the squad had fallen even further down the grid and good results were sparse.

===Formula One (1992–1996)===
Seasoned observers noticed Brundle&#x27;s drives into the points in the uncompetitive Brabham Yamaha in 1991, which was the last points finish for the Brabham team. This helped Brundle get a 1992 switch to Benetton, with whom he would finally claim a recognised podium finish and consistent points finishes with some gritty drives.

In 1992 he had a productive season, with a strong finish to the year. He came close to a win at Canada, where having overtaken Schumacher and closing on leader Gerhard Berger, the transmission failed. He never outqualified teammate Michael Schumacher, but made up places with excellent starts (sixth to third at Silverstone), outraced the German at Imola, Montreal, Magny-Cours and Silverstone, and scored a notable second place at Monza. At Spa, Brundle went by when Schumacher went off the track. Schumacher noticed blisters on his teammate&#x27;s tyres on his return to the circuit and came in for slicks, a move that won him the race. Had Brundle not been distracted he would have pitted as planned at the end of that lap, with victory the most likely result.

To the shock of the F1 paddock, Brundle found himself dropped from Benetton for 1993, Italian Riccardo Patrese taking his place. He came very close to a seat with world champions Williams, but in the end Damon Hill got the drive instead. Still in demand within F1, Brundle raced for Ligier in 1993. More points finishes and a fine third at Imola were achieved in a car without active suspension. With finishing 7th in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship behind the two Williams drivers Alain Prost (1st) and Damon Hill (3rd), McLaren team leader Ayrton Senna (2nd), the Benetton drivers Michael Schumacher (4th) and Riccardo Patrese (5th) and the Ferrari driver Jean Alesi (6th), Brundle was the most successful driver who did not have an active suspension system in his car and Ligier were the most successful team without an active suspension.

For 1994 Brundle was in the frame for the vacant McLaren seat alongside Mika Häkkinen. McLaren were hopeful of re-signing Alain Prost, who had retired at the end of 1993 after winning his fourth championship title, but decided not to renege on his retirement in March, and Brundle got the drive, beating out McLaren test driver Philippe Alliot. He was confirmed less than two weeks before the season-opening 1994 Brazilian Grand Prix.

Joining the team was a case of bad timing in many ways. McLaren were on a downturn and throughout 1994 were unable to win a Grand Prix for the first time since . The team&#x27;s V10 Peugeot engines were unreliable, as was to be expected from a debuting engine supplier. In the first race Brundle narrowly escaped serious injury or worse in a spectacular accident involving Jos Verstappen; his helmet took a heavy blow as the Benetton cartwheeled overhead. At Aida his engine blew whilst running third while at Silverstone his engine appeared to explode just as the starting lights turned green. In reality the culprit was a clutch that cracked spilling its lubricants on top of the hot engine causing a spectacular fire. The engine, once cleaned, worked without problem. Another sure third place was lost on the last lap in Hungary. Nevertheless, when the car was reliable, Brundle put in strong performances that season, most notably at Monaco where he finished second to Schumacher.

Having had poor luck and with Mansell signed to McLaren for 1995, Brundle once more raced for Ligier that year, although not for the full season. To appease Mugen-Honda he had to share the second seat with Aguri Suzuki, a move denounced by many commentators and fans. He impressed however, with a strong fourth at Magny-Cours and what would be his last F1 podium, at Spa, being the highlights. In 1996 he teamed up with Rubens Barrichello at Jordan and enjoyed a good season, despite a slow start and a spectacular crash at Melbourne&#x27;s inaugural GP, with regular points, fourth his best result. He finished fifth in the 1996 Japanese Grand Prix, which was his last Grand Prix in Formula One.

Brundle achieved 9 podiums, and scored a total of 98 championship points, with a best championship finish of 6th in 1992. He was especially strong on street circuits and similarly slow-speed, twisty courses – Monaco, Adelaide and the Hungaroring each produced 4 points finishes for him.

===After Formula One===

====Commentator====
Brundle had hoped to stay in F1 beyond 1996, but could not find a seat. He was offered a seat at Sauber in 1997 following the dropping of Nicola Larini, but decided against it. Brundle did however return to Le Mans. Drives for Nissan, Toyota and Bentley impressed, but a second victory failed to materialise. Brundle returned to Le Mans in 2012 but previous to that last raced in 2001, between which he focused on his role with the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club (BRDC).

Having largely retired from motor racing, Brundle became a highly regarded commentator on British television network ITV, whom he joined when they began Formula One coverage in 1997, initially alongside Murray Walker, and from 2002 James Allen. Brundle joined the BBC&#x27;s commentary team alongside Jonathan Legard when they won back the rights to show F1 from 2009. Before the start of the season, the BBC announced that Brundle was being promoted to lead commentator and would be joined by fellow former F1 driver, David Coulthard. He signed for Sky Sports&#x27; coverage at the end of 2011. At Sky Brundle returned to a co-commentary role, working alongside lead commentator David Croft.

For his television work Brundle has won the RTS Television Sports Award for best Sports Pundit in 1998, 1999, 2005 and 2006. In 2005 the judges described him as:

The production company responsible for ITV&#x27;s F1 coverage, North One Television, also won the Sports Innovation Award for its Insight features, presented by Brundle. His pre-race grid walks are now customary and began at the 1997 British Grand Prix. Discussing the return of Formula One to the BBC in 2009, &quot;The Times&quot; described Brundle &quot;as the greatest TV analyst in this or any other sport.&quot;

Before becoming a regular commentator, Brundle was also part of the 1995 BBC commentary team whenever Aguri Suzuki was driving the Ligier-Mugen Honda, such as the 1995 San Marino Grand Prix. He also commentated on Eurosport for a handful of qualifying sessions in 1995.

With Steve Rider busy covering the England versus Kazakhstan 2010 FIFA World Cup Group 6 qualification match, Brundle co-commentated and presented coverage of the 2008 Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji Speedway.

====Motorsport activities====
Brundle took the wheel of a Jaguar F1 car for the Formula One demonstration in London prior to the 2004 British Grand Prix and drove a BMW Sauber during a demonstration in 2006. Also in 2006, Brundle drove a 2005 Red Bull Racing car around Silverstone as part of ITV&#x27;s &#x27;F1 Insight&#x27; feature. This was followed up in 2007 with Brundle and colleague Blundell both driving Williams F1 cars to demonstrate overtaking.

In 2008 he came out of retirement to drive in the Formula Palmer Audi Championship alongside his son Alex, who was a series regular. He scored three top-eight finishes from the three races in which he took part.

Brundle came out of retirement again to race for United Autosports in the 2011 Daytona 24 Hours, sharing a Ford-powered Riley with Zak Brown, Mark Patterson and former Ligier and Brabham teammate Blundell; the team finished fourth overall.

In June 2011, shortly before the 2011 European Grand Prix, Brundle completed a one-off Formula One test for the series&#x27; tyre supplier Pirelli at Jerez. He completed a total of 70 laps on all of their tyre compounds, with the results and events of the day aired before the 2011 Hungarian Grand Prix.

In June 2012, Brundle made a return to competitive racing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, teaming up with son Alex to race a Greaves Motorsport-run Zytek-Nissan LMP2. His first appearance at the French classic in over a decade, Brundle worked hard to get back into adequate physical condition – using his son&#x27;s race-training exercise programme for a year in preparation. Their car finished 15th out of the 56 runners and 8th in class, completing 340 laps.

====Other activities====

Brundle has been involved in driver management, and was David Coulthard&#x27;s manager until Coulthard retired from racing. He co-owned a management company, 2MB Sports Management, alongside Mark Blundell until January 2009, when he announced his intention to step down in order to focus on his television responsibilities and his son&#x27;s career. Their clients include McLaren test driver Gary Paffett and British Formula 3 champion Mike Conway.

Brundle presented a documentary on British television in 1998 called &quot;Great Escapes&quot;, which showed generally live recordings, and occasionally reconstructions, of stories where human beings managed to somehow survive in face of various dangers or perils. It ran for one series on ITV.

In 2004 he released his first book &quot;Working the Wheel&quot;. The title is a reference to his 1996 crash in Melbourne.

In June 2013 he released his second book &quot;The Martin Brundle Scrapbook&quot;, co-authored with Philip Porter, a biography that tells the story of his life through memorabilia, news cuttings and photographs.

On Friday 13 February 2009, Brundle presented &quot;BBC Look East&quot;&#x27;s 6.30 pm bulletin, with Susie Fowler-Watt, reproducing his famous gridwalk.

==== Criticism of Max Mosley and the FIA ====
In September 2007, he suggested that the treatment of McLaren &quot;had the feel of a witch hunt&quot; in his &quot;Sunday Times&quot; column. As a result of these comments, Brundle and the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; received a French writ from Max Mosley and the FIA for libel. In the same column on 9 December 2007 he accused the FIA of double standards and of issuing the writ at the same time as clearing Renault of spying as a warning to other journalists:
The timing of the writ is significant, in my view, given the FIA&#x27;s decision to find Renault guilty of having significant McLaren designs and information within their systems, but not administering any penalty. It is a warning sign to other journalists and publications to choose their words carefully over that decision. I&#x27;m tired of what I perceive as the &quot;spin&quot; and tactics of the FIA press office, as are many other journalists. I expect my accreditation pass for next year will be hindered in some way to make my coverage of F1 more difficult and to punish me. Or they will write to ITV again to say that my commentary is not up to standard despite my unprecedented six Royal Television Society Awards for sports broadcasting. So be it.

Brundle also asserted his right to voice his opinion about Formula One:
As a former Formula One driver, I have earned the right to have an opinion about the sport, and probably know as much about it as anybody else. I have attended approaching 400 grands prix, 158 as a driver. I have spilt blood, broken bones, shed tears, generated tanker loads of sweat, tasted the champagne glories and plumbed the depths of misery. I have never been more passionate about F1 and will always share my opinions in an honest and open way, knowing readers will make up their own minds.

In March 2008, Brundle voiced his opinion regarding the position of Max Mosley following the &quot;News of The World&#x27;s&quot; allegation that Mosley had engaged in sexual acts with five prostitutes in a scenario that involved Nazi role-playing; saying &quot;It&#x27;s not appropriate behaviour for the head of any global body such as the FIA.&quot; In April, Brundle argued:
The specific detail of the scandal surrounding him is largely irrelevant, in my view. The sporting regulation he has used over the years to keep teams in check relates to bringing the sport into disrepute. If you live by the sword, you die by the sword. Sitting on the fence on this issue for any of us inside the sport is not an option. We must condone or condemn the situation he finds himself in. Mosley&#x27;s position as president is untenable.

====Controversies====
During the commentary of 2023 Spanish Grand Prix, Martin Brundle used the controversial term &quot;Chinaman&quot; to refer to Chinese driver Zhou Guanyu, leading to accusations of racial discrimination against Brundle.

Chinese media outlet &quot;Global Times&quot; wrote to Sky Sports inquiring about the matter. In their reply, Sky Sports stated that Martin Brundle had been reminded to &quot;exercise caution in his language during live broadcasts.&quot; Until 5 January 2024, Brundle has not formally apologized or responded to the issue.

==Helmet==

Brundle&#x27;s helmet was white with two red stripes and a blue stripe between the two red stripes (inspired by the British flag) from the chin to the back of the helmet.
In 1996, a golden ring (with either &#x27;Benson and Hedges&#x27; or &#x27;Brundle&#x27; written on it) and a blue drawing resembling a B (a representation of his trademark &quot;start the engine&quot; gesture) were added.

==Personal life==
The son of a motor car dealer, he and his brother Robin took over the family car dealership from their father. The business closed in 2003 after losing the local Toyota and Peugeot franchises. Robin is also a racing driver, who competes in historic racing events, and was managing director of Lola Cars.

Brundle is married to Liz and they have a daughter, Charlotte, and a son, Alex. Alex has followed his father in pursuing a career in driving; he competed in the 2012 GP3 Series and the FIA World Endurance Championship. Brundle has always lived within a 10-mile radius of King&#x27;s Lynn, and currently lives in Gayton, Norfolk.

In 2017, Brundle disclosed that while covering the 2016 Monaco Grand Prix for Sky Sports, he suffered a heart attack whilst running to do the podium interviews.

==Legacy==
In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modeling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, Brundle was ranked the 30th best Formula One driver of all time.

Canadian film director and screenwriter David Cronenberg, a motor racing enthusiast, named the protagonist of his 1986 film &quot;The Fly&quot; &quot;Seth Brundle&quot; after Martin Brundle. The protagonist of the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;The Fly II&quot; (1989) is Seth Brundle&#x27;s son &quot;Martin Brundle.&quot; Charlie Hamblett portrayed Brundle in the Netflix miniseries &quot;Senna&quot; (2024).

Brundle was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2025 New Year Honours for services to motor racing and sports broadcasting.

<doc id="341566" wikidata="Q5314" url="?curid=341566" title="Halite">
<text>Halite ( ), commonly known as rock salt, is a type of salt, the mineral (natural) form of sodium chloride (NaCl). Halite forms isometric crystals. The mineral is typically colorless or white, but may also be light blue, dark blue, purple, pink, red, orange, yellow or gray depending on inclusion of other materials, impurities, and structural or isotopic abnormalities in the crystals. It commonly occurs with other evaporite deposit minerals such as several of the sulfates, halides, and borates. The name &quot;halite&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek word for &quot;salt&quot;, ἅλς (&quot;háls&quot;).

== Occurrence ==

Halite dominantly occurs within sedimentary rocks where it has formed from the evaporation of seawater or salty lake water. Vast beds of sedimentary evaporite minerals, including halite, can result from the drying up of enclosed lakes and restricted seas. Such salt beds may be hundreds of meters thick and underlie broad areas. Halite occurs at the surface today in playas in regions where evaporation exceeds precipitation such as in the salt flats of Badwater Basin in Death Valley National Park.

In the United States and Canada, extensive underground beds extend from the Appalachian Basin of western New York through parts of Ontario and under much of the Michigan Basin. Other deposits are in Ohio, Kansas, New Mexico, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. Deposits can also be found near Dasol, Pangasinan, Philippines. The Khewra salt mine is a massive deposit of halite near Islamabad, Pakistan. 

Salt domes are vertical diapirs or pipe-like masses of salt that have been essentially &quot;squeezed up&quot; from underlying salt beds by mobilization due to the weight of the overlying rock. Salt domes contain anhydrite, gypsum, and native sulfur, in addition to halite and sylvite. They are common along the Gulf coasts of Texas and Louisiana and are often associated with petroleum deposits. Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Romania and Iran also have salt domes. Salt glaciers exist in arid Iran where the salt has broken through the surface at high elevation and flows downhill. In these cases, halite is said to be behaving like a rheid.

Unusual, purple, fibrous vein-filling halite is found in France and a few other localities. Halite crystals termed &quot;hopper crystals&quot; appear to be &quot;skeletons&quot; of the typical cubes, with the edges present and stairstep depressions on, or rather in, each crystal face. In a rapidly crystallizing environment, the edges of the cubes simply grow faster than the centers. Halite crystals form very quickly in some rapidly evaporating lakes resulting in modern artifacts with a coating or encrustation of halite crystals. &quot;Halite flowers&quot; are rare stalactites of curling fibers of halite that are found in certain arid caves of Australia&#x27;s Nullarbor Plain. Halite stalactites and encrustations are also reported in the Quincy native copper mine of Hancock, Michigan.

== Mining ==
The world&#x27;s largest underground salt mine is the Sifto Salt Mine. It produces over 7 million tons of rock salt per year using the room and pillar mining method. It is located half a kilometre under Lake Huron in Ontario, Canada. In the United Kingdom there are three mines; the largest of these is at Winsford in Cheshire, producing, on average, one million tonnes of salt per year.

== Uses ==
Salt is used extensively in cooking as a flavor enhancer, and to cure a wide variety of foods such as bacon and fish. It is frequently used in food preservation methods across various cultures. Larger pieces can be ground in a salt mill or dusted over food from a shaker as finishing salt.

Halite is also often used both residentially and municipally for managing ice. Because brine (a solution of water and salt) has a lower freezing point than pure water, putting salt or saltwater on ice that is below will cause it to melt—this effect is called freezing-point depression. It is common for homeowners in cold climates to spread salt on their sidewalks and driveways after a snow storm to melt the ice. It is not necessary to use so much salt that the ice is completely melted; rather, a small amount of salt will weaken the ice so that it can be easily removed by other means. Also, many cities will spread a mixture of sand and salt on roads during and after a snowstorm to improve traction. Using salt brine is more effective than spreading dry salt because moisture is necessary for the freezing-point depression to work and wet salt sticks to the roads better. Otherwise the salt can be wiped away by traffic.

In addition to de-icing, rock salt is occasionally used in agriculture. An example of this would be inducing salt stress to suppress the growth of annual meadow grass in turf production. Other examples involve exposing weeds to salt water to dehydrate and kill them preventing them from affecting other plants. Salt is also used as a household cleaning product. Its coarse nature allows for its use in various cleaning scenarios including grease/oil removal, stain removal, dries out and hardens sticky spills for an easier clean.

Some cultures, especially in Africa and Brazil, prefer a wide variety of different rock salts for different dishes. Pure salt is avoided as particular colors of salt indicates the presence of different impurities. Many recipes call for particular kinds of rock salt, and imported pure salt often has impurities added to adapt to local tastes. Historically, salt was used as a form of currency in barter systems and was exclusively controlled by authorities and their appointees. In some ancient civilizations the practice of salting the earth was done to make conquered land of an enemy infertile and inhospitable as an act of domination or spite. One biblical reference to this practice is in Judges 9:45: &quot;he killed the people in it, pulled the wall down and sowed the site with salt.&quot;

Polyhalite, a mineral fertilizer, is not an NaCl-polymer, but hydrated sulfate of potassium, calcium and magnesium (K2Ca2Mg-sulfate).

Shotgun shells containing rock salt (instead of metal pellets) are a &quot;less lethal&quot; deterrent.

<text>The Dickies are an American punk rock band formed in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, in 1977. One of the longest tenured punk rock bands, they have been in continuous existence for over 40 years. They have consistently balanced catchy melodies, harmony vocals, and pop song structures, with a speedy punk guitar attack. This musical approach is paired with a humorous style and has been labelled &quot;pop-punk&quot; or &quot;bubble-gum punk&quot;. The band have sometimes been referred to as &quot;the clown princes of punk&quot;.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1977–1979)===
Eventual Dickies vocalist Leonard Graves Phillips was a self-described celibate, &quot;introverted character&quot; in the period following high school. He played keyboards in his bedroom and, together with friend Bob Davis (later Chuck Wagon), created a type of music that Phillips describes as &quot;autism rock&quot;, similar to Devo, though not as good. Another friend of Phillips was Steve Hufsteter, a former junior high school and high school classmate. The latter figure was the guitarist and main songwriter for local power pop band The Quick and was giving guitar lessons to Stan Lee (born Stan Sobol). Although Hufsteter thought highly of Phillips&#x27; keyboard playing, it was his opinion that Phillips becoming vocalist for the band Lee was starting would be good for his friend&#x27;s social well-being. Phillips intentionally sabotaged his first audition but, realizing his mistake, aggressively entreated Lee for another chance. That audition was successful. Singing for the Dickies had its intended effect for Phillips, causing him to break out of his shell and improving his confidence with women.

As a teenager, Stan Lee was a drug buddy of Iggy Pop, once accepting Pop&#x27;s well-known &quot;leopard&quot; jacket that the latter wore in the Stooges as payment for heroin. Surprisingly, it was not hanging out with Pop that pushed Lee into joining the nascent punk scene but, rather, the experience of going with eventual Dickies bassist Billy Club (Bill Remar) to see The Damned on their first American tour that proved most influential. Exposure to the music of the Ramones and the Weirdos was seminal as well. Prior to deciding on a punk rock direction, Lee had begun to learn guitar at the urging of friend Kevin DuBrow, with the ambition of becoming a Ritchie Blackmore–like virtuoso. His teacher, Hufsteter, suggested that playing punk was a more practical idea and, by way of convincing, provided Lee with his initial introduction to the music of the Ramones. Lee and Club rounded out their initial punk band lineup with Phillips, multi-instrumentalist Chuck Wagon, and drummer Karlos Kaballero (Carlos Caballero), who came up with the name &quot;Dickies&quot; (Lee preferred &quot;the Imbeciles&quot;), and the band made their live debut at the Whisky a Go Go in December 1977. The Dickies were among the first punk rock bands to emerge from Los Angeles. They were the first California punk band to appear on network television (&quot;C.P.O. Sharkey&quot;), and the first California punk band to be signed to a major record label (A&amp;M Records).

The book &quot;Going Underground: American Punk Rock 1979–1989&quot; describes the Dickies in the context of the early L.A. punk scene. Its author contends that the Dickies were &quot;the best musicians on the scene and made good use of their talents&quot;. Also described is an early gig at the Masque in 1977. The opening band was so incompetent that &quot;some punks turned a fire hose on them&quot;. The Dickies came out next, looking like &quot;normal suburban nerds&quot;. The band &quot;erupted in a tight, jackhammer, speed-of-light assault&quot; of &quot;ferocious... goofball comedy punk&quot; which inspired manic punk rock dancing (&quot;bodies carooming off each other&quot;). The author claims that the Dickies&#x27; subsequent record contract caused jealousy among other bands, some of whom would say the Dickies were only in it for money. This belief is contrasted with the Dickies&#x27; actual stated primary goal of being written about in &quot;Slash&quot; (fanzine).

The band&#x27;s A&amp;M record deal came about after that label sacked the Sex Pistols, one of two labels to do so in what manager Malcolm McLaren would later describe as &quot;the Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;, wherein that band would behave poorly and get booted off a label while keeping the signing money. The label wanted a replacement punk band that was more manageable (or at least less notorious), and sent a representative to see the Dickies on the set of &quot;C.P.O. Sharkey&quot;. This was followed up by a showcase at the Whisky and some assertive bluster by Stan Lee, which, along with the enthusiastic efforts of true-believing manager John Hewlett (who also managed Sparks), led to the Dickies landing the record deal. The two albums the band recorded for the label, &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Dickies&quot; (1979) and &quot;Dawn of the Dickies&quot; (1979) are influential, well-regarded early punk records, and were modestly successful commercially (the former peaked at #18 on the UK album charts).

The Dickies had a string of successful singles in the UK, twice making the top 40. They had a Top 10 single with their speedy punk cover of the theme song to a children&#x27;s show with &quot;Banana Splits (Tra La La Song)&quot; in 1979 and reached the top 40 again with their cover of &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; (1979). Their punk rendition of &quot;Silent Night&quot; charted at #47 in December 1978, while their cover of &quot;Paranoid&quot; peaked at #45, in 1979. The band, which has claimed to have sold &quot;a million singles&quot; in England, credits their popularity in that country to being perceived as a &quot;teeny pop&quot; punk band that appealed to the younger siblings of punk rockers.

Their career off to a fast start, the Dickies would tour Europe five times between 1978 and 1980, pausing to play &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on May 3, 1979.

===Post A&amp;M (1980–1989)===
Guitarist/keyboardist/saxophonist/drummer Chuck Wagon (born Bob Davis) released a solo recording, more synth pop than punk rock, entitled &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Won&#x27;t Go Away&quot; (A&amp;M, 1979). Wagon, who was known for his energetic and entertaining antics at Dickies shows (such as running in a circle around his keyboard, or wearing an afro wig while playing saxophone), has been said to have become troubled over time, and dissatisfied with punk rock and the Dickies. He left the band at one point, planning to pursue his solo career, but reunited with the Dickies for a number of concerts. He committed suicide, shooting himself at his parents&#x27; home after a Dickies show, and died in a hospital the next day, on June 28, 1981. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; has called this event &quot;the most sobering moment in Dickies history.&quot;

Wagon&#x27;s death, and drug issues among surviving members, slowed down the Dickies initial momentum considerably starting the 1980s, with John Hewlett being fired as manager and the A&amp;M contract expiring during this period. However, Phillips and Lee have kept the band playing and recording, at times sporadically, at other times more actively, until the present day, achieving venerable, &quot;pop punk godfather&quot; status along the way.

During lulls between activity, the band would occasionally play locally around L.A. to earn a paycheck. But steadier work would come, supported by concerts on both US coasts (and occasionally in between), the UK, and elsewhere. In addition to work on several motion pictures, the band recorded albums for PVC Records (&quot;Stukas Over Disneyland&quot;), Enigma Records (&quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot;, &quot;Second Coming&quot;), Triple X Records (&quot;Idjit Savant&quot; and &quot;Dogs from the Hare that Bit Us&quot;) and Fat Wreck Chords (&quot;All This and Puppet Stew&quot;).

After having had their first two albums released within a nine-month span, there was a nearly four-year gap to the release of &quot;Stukas Over Disneyland&quot; (1983). The influential punk zine Maximum Rocknroll published an enthusiastic review of this album. Writer Steve Spinali asserted that &quot;The Dickies&#x27; first vinyl in almost four years ranks up there near their previous funnypunk triumphs. Most of the eight songs here veer toward amphetamine pop, with irresistible layered choruses to boot... buoyant and entertaining as hell!&quot;

On March 5, 1985, the Dickies were one of a number of California punk bands to play a benefit show for the Cypress College Republicans. Other bands on the bill included the Circle Jerks, the Vandals, and D.I. Lee and Keith Morris from the Circle Jerks both stated that they were doing it out of fondness for the other bands on the bill, and because it was a paying gig (despite being a benefit). Both denied having political motivations for doing the show, and in fact wished for their respective bands to not be associated with politics. As to the show&#x27;s organizers, one stated that there was a motivation to show their fellow college Republicans that punk was nothing to be afraid of, and to encourage them to have fun, since after all “(the college is in) Orange County, a predominantly conservative area, and a lot of punks come from conservative families...(and) a lot of them think Orange County is good.&quot;

Live footage of the Dickies in concert was aired on MTV in 1985, as they were co-featured along with G.B.H. in a concert special entitled &quot;Punks and Poseurs: A Journey Through the Los Angeles Underground&quot;, which also featured interviews with fans, as well as figures like Pleasant Gehman and Iris Berry.

In 1986, cassette-only label ROIR released a Dickies live compilation entitled &quot;We Aren&#x27;t the World&quot;. It contains performances from 7 different Dickies concerts, ranging in vintage from 1977 to 1985, and from regions ranging from NY (C.B.G.B.) and NJ, to California, to the U.K.

Among the bands that the Dickies shared bills with between 1985 and 1987 are Red Hot Chili Peppers, Janes Addiction, Faith No More, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Ramones, X, T.S.O.L., Thelonious Monster, Dead Milkmen, and Murphy&#x27;s Law.

In 1988, the Dickies wrote and performed the theme song for the cult classic horror film &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot;, which also became the title track for a Dickies EP released that year. It was produced by Ron Hitchcock, and was the debut of drummer Cliff Martinez who had recently played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Weirdos, and Captain Beefheart. Martinez played with The Dickies from 1988 to 1994, and on the &quot;Second Coming&quot;, &quot;Locked N&#x27; Loaded Live in London&quot;, and &quot;Idjit Savant&quot; albums.

Also in 1988, The Dickies appeared in the comedic motion picture &quot;18 Again!&quot;, starring George Burns. In the movie, Burns&#x27; 81-year-old character switches consciousnesses/souls with his 18-year-old grandson. In one scene, the octogenarian-turned-teenager accompanies a teenaged girl to a punk club, where the Dickies perform &quot;You Drive Me Ape (You Big Gorilla)&quot;. The whole song is performed, at times in the foreground, at times in the background. Closeups of Phillips wearing an ape mask (as is his penchant during live performances of the song), and Tarzan-like rope swinging by the singer, are featured.

A gap of five years between their third and fourth studio albums elapsed (notwithstanding the &quot;Killer Klowns&quot; EP). A writer at the Los Angeles Times was led to connect the title of their 1989 long player, &quot;Second Coming&quot;, to the band&#x27;s &quot;comeback status&quot;. The writer noted that this album had some Beatles-like melodicism and some &quot;art-rock aspirations&quot;, while retaining the Dickies&#x27; characteristic punk &quot;silliness&quot;. The writer also noted that the Dickies would be undertaking a national tour supporting the release.

The close of the decade saw the third Dickies-involved motion picture. In the opening minutes of the 1989 skateboard drama &quot;Gleaming the Cube&quot;, starring Christian Slater, Slater&#x27;s character Brian is seen flying in a small airplane over Disneyland, along with four friends and the pilot, when the five skaters sing a line from the chorus of &quot;Stukas over Disneyland&quot;. The song, which the characters would later listen to in a bedroom, is also featured on the soundtrack.

===During the pop punk revival (1990–1999)===
The Dickies toured Europe in 1990 for the first time in a decade. Upon their arrival on the continent, meeting fans provided evidence to band members of their enduring popularity despite their ten year absence. They have returned regularly since then, including participation in multi-band punk rock festivals.

In 1990, the Dickies wrote another theme song for a motion picture. This time it was for Lucas Reiner&#x27;s time travel comedy film &quot;Spirit of 76&quot;, which stars David Cassidy, Leif Garrett, Devo, and Redd Kross.

1991 saw the release of another live Dickies album, this one entitled &quot;Live In London - Locked &#x27;N&#x27; Loaded&quot;, put out by German label &quot;Rebel Rec.&quot; It was recorded at &quot;the Dome&quot; in London on October 11, 1990.

On June 4, 1993, the Dickies headlined a one-day festival called the &quot;Milwaukee Mega Jam&quot;. Other acts on the bill included Green Day (a half year before the release of their breakthrough &quot;Dookie&quot; album), Agent Orange, and the Didjits. Also in 1993, the band released a 3 song EP entitled &quot;Road Kill&quot; on Triple X Records.

In addition to whatever personal issues the Dickies had to cope with in the middle part of their career, there was also the commercial challenge of the decline of the original punk scene, replaced by post punk, college rock, underground hardcore punk, and, eventually, alternative rock, none of which provided the Dickies with a suitable milieu. Therefore, the profile of the band was uplifted with the rise of California pop punk in the 1990s, with successful bands like the Offspring and Green Day citing the Dickies as an influence. Leonard Phillips noted in a 1994 interview that &quot;We are being recognized in a mainstream way again.&quot;

One outgrowth of the revived attention given the Dickies, and attempts by interviewers to connect them to the current scene, was a minor feud with Green Day. This resulted from a misunderstood joke from the Dickies camp, often repeated (it was a stock answer to a frequent question), saying the multi-platinum selling Green Day should support their forebears by &quot;passing the hat&quot; at a stadium gig to fund a punk rock retirement home. One shortened version of this idea had Stan Lee saying &quot;they should just write us a check&quot;, which was interpreted as Green Day ripping the Dickies off. This led to salty quotes from the former band directed at the Dickies in an issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot;, which Leonard Phillips describes as being &quot;WWF&quot; style: the Dickies are &quot;the most bitter old bastards&quot;, who are &quot;just another Ramones rip-off&quot;. Apparently it blew over, as Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt would attend Dickies shows after this, and was friendly in his interactions with them.

By the time of &quot;Idjit Savant&quot; (1994), the Dickies had released their third consecutive album which followed a prolonged recording hiatus, at least with respect to studio LPs. About this state of affairs, Leonard Phillips told the Chicago Tribune &quot;every few years, it&#x27;s me and Stan against the world with three new faces behind us.&quot; Axl Rosenberg of MetalSucks wrote of &quot;Idjit Savant&quot; that it is &quot;one of the best pop-punk albums of all time&quot;, superior to American Idiot. He also noted that it was recorded during a time of dour grunge and angry nu metal music, and called the Dickies album possibly &quot;the feel good album of the 90’s&quot;. The Dickies toured with Gwar in the fall of &#x27;94 supporting this release.

The holiday compilation &quot;Punk Rock Xmas&quot; (1995) by Rhino Entertainment includes the Dickies version of &quot;Silent Night&quot;. Other artists on the collection include Ramones, The Damned, Fear, and Stiff Little Fingers. A compilation that the Dickies were &quot;conspicuously&quot; absent from, however, was Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits (1996). This compilation featured alternative and punk bands covering songs from cartoons. Entertainment Weekly labeled the Dickies &quot;the kings of the genre&quot;, and noted they had already covered three of the album&#x27;s songs; a fourth, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, the theme song for a comic character which is a frequent visual motif of Stan Lee&#x27;s guitars and stage apparel, went to a band the Dickies shared many concert bills with- the Ramones.

Jonathan Melvoin, who played drums on &quot;Idjit Savant&quot;, died of a heroin overdose on July 12, 1996, in New York, aged 34, while on tour playing keyboards for the Smashing Pumpkins.

A reviewer for a November 1998 Dickies concert in Hartford, Connecticut, suggested that most attendees were old school punks wearing &quot;vintage leather jackets&quot; and &quot;buttons that could be artifacts at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&quot;. The writer quotes Leonard Phillips as sarcastically indicating his willingness to court a younger crowd by rebranding the Dickies as an &quot;alternative&quot; punk rock band.

The Dickies closed out the decade by recording an all-covers album, &quot;Dogs From the Hare That Bit Us&quot;. Jack Rabid, noting that the Dickies had a long history of recording covers, some of which are &quot;terrific&quot;, gave this release a very favorable review, writing that although the latest batch were more reverent and less humorous than some previous efforts, it was &quot;still frickin&#x27; great and a lot of fun.&quot;

=== Turn of the century (2000–2009) ===
Stan Lee negotiated the band&#x27;s &quot;Fat Wreck Chords&quot; deal by fibbing to label owner Fat Mike, a Dickies fan who had, in 1996, obtained a 4 song demo the Dickies had recorded. Neither Lee nor Leonard Phillips had heard of the label head/NOFX front man, but were filled in by a member of the Dickies camp. Lee claimed that he had &quot;an album&#x27;s worth of material&quot; ready to record, when in fact the band actually only had the 4 songs. Following this claim, a deal was agreed upon, but the L.P. was delayed by the amount of time it took to come up with and record an appropriate amount of material. The resulting record found a prominent fan in Milo Aukerman. The scientist/Descendents front man has stated that &quot;All This and Puppet Stew&quot; gave him encouragement to continue playing into advancing middle age. &quot;I was just extremely impressed with how they put out a great record [at that age]. It definitely set the kernel in my mind that you could be in your late 40s and still put out a record that full-on brought the punk rock from start to finish.&quot;

&quot;Spectrum Records&quot; released the 18 song compilation &quot;The Dickies – The Punk Singles Collection&quot; in 2002.

In the Summer of 2003 the Dickies were part of a package tour of classic punk bands. Called &quot;Fiend Fest&quot;, it was headlined by the Misfits, and, besides the Dickies, also featured The Damned, Agnostic Front, D.I., Marky Ramone, Dez from Black Flag, and Japanese band Balzac.

The Dickies played the 2004 Ramones 30th Anniversary tribute concert in Los Angeles, which was filmed. The Dickies are also in the 2006 documentary &quot;Too Tough to Die: A Tribute to Johnny Ramone&quot;, along with X, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Joan Jett, Rob Zombie, and others. The film features footage from the 2004 concert, which was held in particular to honor the then seriously-ill Ramones guitarist. The Dickies perform &quot;You Drive Me Ape (You Big Gorilla)&quot; and the Ramones song &quot;Today Your Love (Tomorrow the World)&quot;, and in interview footage, they talk about their shared history with the New York band. Another video release from this period is entitled &quot;The Dickies: An Evening With the Dickies&quot; (2005, Secret Films).

The Dickies played the 2007 Warped Tour, a North American punk rock festival, for the first time in what would be four consecutive years, and five years total.

Leonard Phillips provided guest vocals on the Vibrators&#x27; cover of &quot;vibrator&quot; by Motörhead, on the former band&#x27;s &quot;Pure Punk&quot; album (2009).

The decade closed on two sour notes, as a pair of former Dickies died in the year 2009. Enoch Hain (born Robert Frederick Orin Lansing, Jr.), Dickies guitarist for a period stretching from the late 1980s into the mid 1990s, died on July 25, 2009, from complications arising from pneumonia. And original drummer Karlos Kabellero (born Carlos Cabellero), who gave the band its name and was one of its songwriters during his tenure, died on September 22, 2009, from heart-related problems.

=== Present day (2010–present) ===

In 2010, The Dickies hit cover of &quot;Banana Splits&quot; provides the soundtrack to a violent action scene in the superhero movie &quot;Kick Ass.&quot;

The new decade found the Dickies on the road. Reviewing an August 2011 headlining concert in Bristol, England, a writer remarked on their enduring appeal in that country. The mix of young and older attendees was noted, and it was stated that the event had a &quot;timeless&quot; feel. Back in the U.S. for the 2012 Riot Fest in Chicago, the Dickies played the &quot;after party&quot;, along with NOFX, Adicts, and the Casualties.

The Dickies live dates in 2013 included Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;Great American Nightmare&quot; fest in Los Angeles, and supporting the Damned in Birmingham, England. Regarding the latter, an impressed reviewer suggested that the Dickies were &quot;the perfect support act for the Damned&quot;, and praised the band for &quot;having the balls&quot; to play their &quot;crunching take&quot; on Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;paranoid&quot; in that band&#x27;s hometown. Other tour dates that year included concerts in the US northeast. The band continued to tour consistently through 2014 and 2015, including dates throughout North America, one of which was the 2015 Gwar B-Q, and also shows in Australia.

Secret Records released &quot;Banana Splits&quot; (2016), which is the title of both a DVD and a CD documenting a 2002 Dickies concert in England, featuring a guest performance from Michael &quot;Olga&quot; Algar of Toy Dolls. With respect to live performances from the calendar year 2016, the Dickies toured the US and Europe, and were part of the 2016 Rebellion Festival in the U.K. Unfortunately, Phillips became ill with gallstones during a ferry trip from the Netherlands, leading to a hospital visit and endangering the scheduled performances. With the singer&#x27;s encouragement, the band performed the dates without him, in a &quot;Dickies karaoke&quot; format. Vocal duties were handled by fans, members of the band&#x27;s entourage, and by guest punk notables, including members of The Rezillos, the Vibrators, Leftöver Crack, the Exploited, GBH, the Dwarves, Extreme Noise Terror, Girlschool, Big D and the Kids Table, and others.

2017 was the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary, which they celebrated by touring, including 16 dates in England and Ireland, and that year&#x27;s iteration of the &quot;Punk Rock Bowling&quot; festival in Las Vegas, which, among many other notable punk artists, was headlined by old band associate Iggy Pop. Stan Lee, in an interview promoting the tour, explained that their somewhat erratic touring schedule, historically, was in part due to his reluctance to be separated from his pet dogs for long stretches of time.

Another leg of the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary tour included a run of dates on the 2017 Warped Tour. An incident occurred on July 25, their final day with Warped, which caused the band to become the center of a controversy, to the extent that an LA Weekly writer characterized it as &quot;tearing apart the hardcore music community right now&quot;. While performing, Phillips was targeted by a sign-holding friend of feminist band War on Women, who protested his &quot;sexist&quot;, humorous, politically incorrect stage banter. Phillips responded with angry, profane insults, and this was captured via cellphone video and posted online. As a result, some in the punk scene denounced the Dickies, while others, including Noodles of the Offspring, Buzz Osborne, Ben Weasel, the Dwarves, and Jesse Hughes of Eagles of Death Metal, voiced their support for the band.

In May 2018, the Dickies, along with the Hollywood Chamber Orchestra, played the theme to Killer Klowns From Outer Space live at the sold-out Montalbán Theatre, during the 30th-anniversary screening of that film. Other activity in 2018 included Oakland&#x27;s &quot;Burger Boogaloo&quot; festival alongside Devo, the Damned, the Dwarves, host John Waters, and many others, and two runs of tour dates supported by the Queers.

The Dickies released a single in 2019, their first studio recording in over a decade. A cover of Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;I Dig Go Go Girls&quot;, it features a contribution from Monkey from the Adicts. The B-side is called &quot;the Dreaded Pigasaurus&quot;, which is a reference to a creature that functions as garbage disposal in The Flintstones.

Recent live dates include &quot;Punk Rock Bowling&quot; in May 2019, and T.S.O.L.&#x27;s 40th anniversary show in January 2020. Continuing to share billing with peers, The Dickies were scheduled to be among the headliners (along with Cockney Rejects, UK Subs, Anti Nowhere League, and others) in a one day Scottish punk festival in April 2020, and were also to play a number of concerts in the U.S. in June 2020 with Total Chaos, T.S.O.L., and headliners Black Flag.

In an interview with Goldmine, Leonard Phillips stated that the band will record a &quot;final&quot; album. In the same interview, another purported project on the way is discussed: an autobiographical book of humorous short stories by Phillips.

==Musical style and themes==
Some artists eschew the term &quot;pop punk&quot;, perhaps viewing it as implying less authenticity than the label &quot;punk rock&quot; (for example, Green Day&#x27;s Billie Joe Armstrong: &quot;I’ve always hated the phrase. I think it’s a contradiction in terms. Either you’re punk, or you’re not.”). Phillips, however, has said he &quot;has no problem&quot; with the label being applied to the Dickies, rhetorically asking &quot;can I help it if we are musical?&quot; Stan Lee once said of the early period of the Dickies: &quot;We were a pop band masquerading as a punk band.&quot;

During the band&#x27;s formative period, they viewed the already existing punk bands as being divided into two camps: serious political bands (such as the Sex Pistols and the Clash), and fun, entertaining bands (like the Damned and the Ramones). The Dickies made a deliberate choice to belong to the latter camp, albeit with a distinctive southern California vibe. Elaborating on their distinction from the angrier, angstier bands, some of whom had gritty upbringings, Lee points out that at the &quot;Dawn of the Dickies&quot;&#x27; career, he was living with his parents in the San Fernando Valley with a swimming pool, preoccupied with waterslides and television shows, finding not much to complain about. Hufsteter, an influential figure in the Dickies&#x27; formation and a sometimes &quot;extra member&quot; of the band, opines that &quot;the Dickies never really thought of themselves as punks&quot; at the outset, but instead saw the form &quot;as an opportunity&quot;, particularly the &quot;silly&quot; variant of punk evident in Ramones music.

Many of the Dickies lyrics concern Southern California culture, rife with references and in-jokes; examples include songs like &quot;Waterslide&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m A Chollo&quot;, &quot;Manny, Moe, and Jack&quot;, Stukas Over Disneyland, and &quot;(I&#x27;m Stuck in a Pagoda with) Tricia Toyota&quot;. Another theme is classic cartoons/children&#x27;s TV, with songs like &quot;Banana Splits (tra la la song)&quot;, &quot;Gigantor&quot;, &quot;Eep Opp Ork (Uh Uh)&quot; (from the Jetsons), &quot;Bowling with Bedrock Barney&quot;, and most recently, another Flintstones reference with &quot;The Dreaded Pigasaurus&quot;. Phillips has said that these choices add up to a social commentary. He saw some of his peers in LA punk coming from privileged backgrounds, but projecting UK working class-style angst. &quot;We wanted to show all those bourgeois ‘punks’ what it really MEANT to come from the valley.&quot;

The Dickies are also known for recording many fast-paced punk covers of classic rock songs, including The Moody Blues&#x27; &quot;Nights in White Satin,&quot; The Quick&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Please Me&quot;, Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid,&quot; The Monkees&#x27; &quot;She,&quot; Barry McGuire&#x27;s &quot;Eve of Destruction,&quot; The Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Nobody But Me,&quot; The Left Banke&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Ballerina,&quot; The Cowsills&#x27; &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;Sound of Silence&quot; by Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;, The Germs &quot;Golden Boys&quot;, as well as the covers album, &quot;Dogs from the Hare That Bit Us&quot;. When asked about this penchant of the band, Lee explained &quot;it was easier as you didn&#x27;t have to write the songs.&quot; Regarding the band&#x27;s choice of material, Lee has said that they cover &quot;mostly songs we liked when we were 13.&quot; Describing the tone of some of the early covers of 1960&#x27;s music, Lee characterizes it as &quot;affectionate piss-takes of hippies and the old culture.&quot;
Phillips has said that he feels the Dickies many covers are different in character from those by latter-day punk cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes (who have paid homage to the Dickies by playing a snippet of &quot;You Drive Me Ape&quot; in their cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;All My Loving&quot;). Phillips feels that band employs a formula, whereas the Dickies reinterpret songs that are meaningful to them.

Something else that the Dickies are known for is Phillips&#x27; routines when playing live, including wearing an ape mask or scuba gear, and using props ranging from a dog puppet, to a talking penis puppet (&quot;Stewart&quot;), to an inflatable female &quot;love doll&quot;, each for use during particular songs. Regarding this &quot;bag of tricks&quot;, Lee has said “It’s all nonsense to me. I play guitar.” Hufsteter claims this aspect of the Dickies&#x27; live shows is an influence of his band the Quick, who Phillips was once involved with.

In the book &quot;Punk Rock: So What? The Cultural Legacy of Punk&quot;, edited by Roger Sabin, a writer states that the Dickies follow in a tonal/thematic tradition started by immediate predecessors the Dictators and the Ramones, but it is &quot;in the Dickies (that) punk&#x27;s simultaneous parody and celebration of commercial teen culture reached its apex&quot;. The author believes that 90&#x27;s punk like Green Day, the Offspring, and Pennywise are indebted to the older punk trio for this reason.

==Influence==
In a feature about the Bad Brains in &quot;Timeline&quot;, it was written that the Dickies and the Dead Boys were among the Brains&#x27; punk influences, which they combined with jazz and funk influences. Metal Storm&#x27;s biography of the Bad Brains also lists the Dickies, along with Dead Boys, Black Sabbath, and the Sex Pistols as being among the band&#x27;s influences. Jack Rabid, writing for AllMusic wrote, perhaps hyperbolically, that the Dickies&#x27; cover of &quot;paranoid&quot; by Sabbath &quot;basically inspired the Bad Brains to form!&quot;

Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion and Epitaph Records has stated that members of his band &quot;grew up with&quot; the Dickies, and considers the band &quot;one of the greatest punk bands&quot;, as good as the Buzzcocks. He praises the Dickies songs more than their humor.

Green Day and the Offspring have cited Dickies influence. While the former band would later give mixed messages about their feelings about the Dickies, Noodles, guitarist for the Offspring, said that the Dickies are &quot;one of my favorites&quot;, in a Rolling Stone interview.

Ben Weasel of Screeching Weasel included the Dickies in a short list of punk bands that &quot;were sort of pioneers, both musically and in what they did to lay the groundwork for bands like mine.&quot;

Joe &quot;Queer&quot; King has stated that his band is in a tradition of punk bands, like the Dickies, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, X, Circle Jerks, Angry Samoans, and Flipper, that &quot;were funny, but... had a message&quot;, and feels that this spirit is lost on modern, politically sensitive audiences, who are &quot;just looking for a reason to say they’re offended&quot;.

The Groovie Ghoulies, themselves named after the cartoon &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot;, were influenced by the &quot;cartoon-punk&quot; aspect of the Dickies.

In a profile of Bob Mould in Pop Matters, it was said that in writing/performing for Hüsker Dü, he was driven by &quot;being faster&quot; than the Dickies, Ramones, and Buzzcocks.

Ian MacKaye recounted an anecdote to a reporter from Salon about listening to a mix tape an acquaintance made, while in a car traveling to a Ramones concert, in 1979. He recalled &quot;it had that Dickies &#x27;Banana Splits&#x27; song on it and it just blew my mind! As soon as I got back I started searching out all these bands, because I was so intoxicated with all this music.&quot;

Fat Mike of NOFX, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, and Fat Wreck Chords, and Milo Aukerman of Descendents, both cite the Dickies as an influence.

Johnny Ramone of the punk band The Ramones &quot;officially&quot; ranked the Dickies as one of the top 10 greatest punk bands of all time.

<doc id="341576" wikidata="Q3570091" url="?curid=341576" title="Austin Wranglers">
<text>The Austin Wranglers were an arena football team based in Austin, Texas. They played four seasons in the Arena Football League from 2004 to 2007 and spent one season in af2, the AFL&#x27;s developmental league, in 2008. They made playoff appearances in the AFL in 2006 and in af2 in 2008. They played their home games at the Frank Erwin Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

==History==
The Wranglers began play in February 2004 as an expansion team in the Arena Football League. They played their home games at the Frank Erwin Center on the University of Texas campus, playing in the Southern Division of the National Conference. The franchise is not to be confused with another Arena Football team called the Oklahoma Wranglers, who played the 2000 and 2001 seasons in Oklahoma City. For The 2025 Season, They Joined The National Gridiron League (United States)

In 2004, the Wranglers accumulated an 8–8 record with such notables as quarterback John Kaleo, Charlie Davidson, and Darryl Hammond leading the Wrangler&#x27;s respectable offensive campaign. The Wranglers however were unable to qualify for the playoffs, after stumbling to 3 losses to close out the season.

The 2004 off-season was relatively quiet; signings included former All-Rookie teamer OL/DL Bryan Henderson, OS Ira Gooch, and QB John Fitzgerald. Departed was former starting quarterback John Kaleo, traded to the Los Avengers for cash and future considerations.

The original mascot for the Austin Wranglers was named Blaze, who was a horse, and in 2005 he was joined by a cowboy - Red Eye (whose eyes glowed red). Due to the expansion team in Utah, the Blaze, the Austin Wranglers changed the name of their mascot to avoid confusion, so the final mascot had a &quot;wilder&quot; appearance than before and went by the name &quot;Trigger&quot;.

The training camp which ensued was headlined by the competition between free agent pick up John Fitzgerald, fresh off leading the expansion VooDoo to the playoffs, against 2004 back-up Bobby Pesavento. Pesavento would ultimately defeat Fitzgerald for the starting job though Fitzgerald would take over four games into the season.

John Fitzgerald remained one of the only bright spots on a depleted team, as the Wrangler&#x27;s finished 2005 with a 6–10 record.

Realizing the past failures in 2004 and 2005, the Wranglers management had an active off-season. Team presidents Doug MacGregor and Glyn Milburn both made important re-signings and signings, including Sedrick Robinson, AFL all-time leading tackler Damon Mason, Donvetis Franklin, Donovan Arp, Derrick Lewis, Chance Mock, and Marcus McKenzie.

On Wednesday, April 26, 2006, Deion Sanders, the multi-talented athlete who retired from playing in the NFL, became one of the franchise&#x27;s owners.

On May 7, 2006, the Wranglers clinched their first ever playoff berth with a win over the Grand Rapids Rampage. Unfortunately the Wranglers were eliminated from the playoffs after losing to the Philadelphia Soul in the first round of the wild card playoffs.

Shortly after the end of the Wranglers&#x27; season, team owner Doug MacGregor announced the firing of Skip Foster, after leading the Wranglers to a franchise best 10–6 season. This shocking move led many to speculate what the Wrangler&#x27;s intentions were for the future.

After a month full of searching for the future head coach of the Wranglers, Austin announced on June 29, 2006, former offensive coordinator of the Colorado Crush, Brian Partlow, would lead the Wranglers in 2007. During his three seasons as offensive coordinator with the Crush, Partlow established a respected offense in the AFL, in which managed to win one Arena Bowl. Along with this success, Partlow coached offensive specialist Damian Harrell to two consecutive offensive player of the year seasons, while establishing John Dutton, cover boy of EA Sport&#x27;s Arena Football, as one of the most feared quarterbacks in the league.

On September 15, 2006, the Arena Football League sent shockwaves through its fanbase announcing the implementation of free-substitution, substantially eliminating any remains of the AFL&#x27;s highly regarded reputation of Ironman football. Previously teams were restricted one substitution per quarter, forcing wide receivers, defensive backs, offensive and defensive linemen to play both sides of the ball. It was highly believed teams would take advantage of this change, in increasing signings of former NFL and NFL Europe players rather than searching for existing talent already in the AFL. A month later in October, the Wranglers quickly proved this theory.

After a relatively quiet opening to the free agency period with the signing of former Georgia Force defensive specialist Nate Coggins, the Wranglers took advantage of the AFL&#x27;s free-substitution rule, signing of a rather large batch of rookies lacking experience in the arena game including former Texas Longhorn Mike Williams. In addition, the Wranglers signed 2004 AFL Rookie of the Year and former Florida State Seminoles quarterback Adrian McPherson.

Following training camp 2007, the Wranglers roster was set as seven rookies made the cut (nearly a fourth of the team), while Adrian McPherson, Nate Coggins, Anthony Hines, and Chad Dukes were the lone AFL veteran free agent pick ups making the squad. The rest of the roster remained the core nucleus of the Wrangler&#x27;s playoff run in 2006, including starting defensive specialist Damon Mason and stand out wide receiver Derrick Lewis.

The 2007 season, which would end up being the Wrangler&#x27;s last in the AFL, served largely as a disappointment. Highly touted free agent pick up Adrian McPherson failed to live up to high expectations and was cut midway through the season, while the defense was among the league&#x27;s worst, ranking 18th and 17th in defensive passing and receiving respectively. Fans speculate whether the loss of former defensive coordinator Jon Norris may have attributed to the Wrangler&#x27;s defensive struggles in 2007.

On October 12, 2007, the team announced that they were moving from the AFL to the af2 after much speculation. The ownership had made the decision due to financial difficulties, some rumoring the Wrangler&#x27;s had lost over $4 million in 2007. In addition the decision was lubricated by the fact Doug MacGregor had purchased four expansion teams in the af2 in 2007, including the Corpus Christi Sharks and the Lubbock Renegades.

A new era of Wrangler&#x27;s football began on October 22, 2007 with the signing of AFL Hall of Famer Ben Bennett as head coach of the Wranglers. In addition to an impressive resume as quarterback in college and the arena league, Bennett had coached the Florida Firecats to an ArenaCup title in 2004, and had accumulated a 56-33 record with the Manchester Wolves from 2005–2007.

Despite dropping to af2 and considering playing in Cedar Park Entertainment Center to cut costs, success did not follow the Wranglers to af2 while financial difficulties continued to plague the team. Ownership announced in September 2008 that the franchise would cease operations and not appear in 2009.

<doc id="341578" wikidata="Q196144" url="?curid=341578" title="New Orleans VooDoo">
<text>The New Orleans VooDoo were a professional arena football team based in New Orleans, Louisiana. They were members of the Arena Football League from 2004 to 2015.

The VooDoo were the second team to play in the Arena Football League and play in New Orleans, the New Orleans Night, who had competed in the 1991 and 1992 AFL seasons in the Louisiana Superdome, one of the few stadiums capable of a full-size football surface to host arena football. In contrast to the Night, the VooDoo played their home games in both of their incarnations at the Smoothie King Center.

The original New Orleans VooDoo played in the AFL from 2004 to 2008, at which point the league suspended operations. During that time they were owned in part by Tom Benson, who also owned the National Football League&#x27;s New Orleans Saints. At the completion of the 2008 season, VooDoo owner Tom Benson announced the disbanding of the VooDoo. This led to the termination of operations for the AFL and ultimate filing by the League of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. The minor league affiliate of the AFL, af2, continued play through the 2009 season.

In the Fall of 2009, several af2 owners, Paul Ross of the Tulsa Talons, Dan Newman of the Bossier-Shreveport Battle Wings, and Brady Nelson of the Spokane Shock, spearheaded in conjunction with Brett Bouchy, former owner of the AFL&#x27;s Arizona Rattlers and Orlando Predators, a move to purchase the assets of the AFL out of Bankruptcy. This successful transaction resulted in the reformation of the AFL for the 2010 season. Prior to the 2010 season, the af2 league terminated operations. Several af2 teams chose to move into the AFL, including the Talons, BattleWings, Iowa Barnstormers, Spokane Shock, Tennessee Valley Vipers, and Boise Burn. Prior to the 2011 AFL season, several AFL teams relocated: The Talons moved from Tulsa to San Antonio; the Vipers moved from Huntsville, Alabama to Atlanta, Georgia, and reactivated the Georgia Force; the BattleWings left Bossier City for New Orleans and reactivated the New Orleans VooDoo. Legendary AFL player/coach Derek Stingley coached the VooDoo for the 2011 season and was replaced in 2012 by longtime AFL quarterback and coach Pat O&#x27;Hara. In 2015, the VooDoo&#x27;s final season, Dean Cokinos was the head coach. At the completion of the 2015 season, the New Orleans VooDoo ceased operations.

The VooDoo&#x27;s official mascots were known as Bones and Mojo. Their cheerleaders were known as the VooDoo Dolls.

A new version known as the [[Louisiana VooDoo]] made an effort to revive the brand in the 2024 reboot of the AFL but was unable to secure a home in New Orleans, Bossier City or Lake Charles; the team would instead play only two games, its lone home game at Blackham Coliseum in Lafayette, before folding due to issues with league finances.

==History==

===Franchise is born===
In 1998, New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson committed to the purchase of an Arena Football League (AFL) team, making him the first National Football League (NFL) owner to do so. On March 7, 2002, Benson announced that he would be fielding a franchise in 2003. However, the VooDoo played their inaugural game on the road against the Philadelphia Soul on February 8, 2004. The game marked the return of the AFL to New Orleans, where the New Orleans Night franchise had played two seasons in 1991–1992. The VooDoo logo consists of a human skull wearing a top hat and sunglasses.

In their first year, they drew big crowds to their home games as they became the second team other than the Orlando Predators or Tampa Bay Storm to win the AFL&#x27;s Southern Division. The team&#x27;s average attendance of 15,240 ranked fifth in the league and was a major factor in the VooDoo&#x27;s 7–1 regular season home record.

In 2005, the team started strong, but later found itself on the wrong end of some close, hard-fought games. At a sold-out TD Waterhouse Centre, the VooDoo ended their second regular season against Orlando with both needing a win to reach the playoffs. A second-half rally featuring a fumble return for a touchdown by Thabiti Davis brought the VooDoo back into the game briefly, but a Jay Taylor kickoff hit the iron surrounding the nets and was recovered by the Predators. After another touchdown to bring the lead up to 15, the game was effectively over. The final score was 51–40, ending the VooDoo&#x27;s season at 9–7.

Despite the underachievement, the VooDoo had an average attendance of 15,338, good for third in the 17-team AFL, and again had the New Orleans market lead the nation in television ratings for Sunday AFL broadcasts on NBC.

The VooDoo&#x27;s success and popularity led the AFL to consider placing the ArenaBowl in New Orleans. Although it had already signed a deal with Las Vegas to have the ArenaBowl there for 2005, 2006 and 2007, the league had considered terminating that deal. Had the bidding for ArenaBowl XX begun, New Orleans would have been an early favorite, along with Orlando and Arizona.

===Hurricane Katrina===
On August 28, 2005, it was announced that due to the extensive damage suffered by Hurricane Katrina to the New Orleans Arena, the VooDoo would suspend operations for the 2006 season. Fifteen of the players under contract with the VooDoo were moved to the expansion Kansas City Brigade for the 2006 season.

===Return in 2007===
In 2007, the VooDoo returned with Mike Neu as the head coach. The team set an AFL season ticket record, selling over 13,000 season tickets. This led to the VooDoo leading in announced attendance as well, drawing 16,645 to their eight home games, 800 more than the second-place Philadelphia Soul.

The VooDoo started 4–3, before a seven-game losing streak dropped them to 4–10 and eliminated them from the playoff race.

The final record of 5–11 included the first ever victory by the VooDoo over the Orlando Predators, a dominating 67–54 victory over the eventual ArenaBowl XXI champion San Jose Sabercats, a 78–34 nationally televised defeat at the Philadelphia Soul that ranks as the worst loss in franchise history, a 69–63 nationally televised loss to the New York Dragons where the VooDoo used some curious strategy to run the clock down before going for the winning score on fourth down, and a narrow 80–79 defeat at the Dallas Desperados, in which the VooDoo missed a two-point conversion to try to win the game after regulation time expired.

Despite the terrible record, several players were revelations for the VooDoo. Steve Bellisari, a former Ohio State quarterback, took over the starting job from AFL veteran Andy Kelly; the VooDoo offense became more efficient later in the season. Jonathan Ruffin, a New Orleans native and former Lou Groza award winner, took over kicking duties late in the season and was far more efficient than his predecessor Eric Houle. James Lynch was named to the All-Rookie team at fullback.

===2008===
The VooDoo were picked by prognosticators to bring up the rear of the AFL after free agent WR Derrick Lewis was injured in training camp. By losing the first game in Los Angeles, and having starting Quarterback Steve Bellisari get hurt, things started to look bleak for the VooDoo. Backup quarterback Danny Wimprine, from the New Orleans area, took over, and led by a defense that threatened to shatter the AFL record for interceptions in a season, the VooDoo won seven of their next eight games and threatened to run away with the Southern Division. The VooDoo then suffered a collapse, losing six of their last seven games, and missed the Arena Football playoffs for the third consecutive season, finishing 8–8. Speculation ensued about Mike Neu&#x27;s job as head coach, as the VooDoo suffered four second-half-of-the-season collapses in their four years as a franchise, but early indications were that he would continue to be the coach in 2009.

The New Orleans VooDoo received the Arena Football League&#x27;s Best Support Staff Award during the ArenaBall Awards Ceremony held in New Orleans on Friday, July 25, 2008.

On October 13, 2008, owner Tom Benson announced the New Orleans VooDoo would not be continuing operations in New Orleans. Reasons given were &quot;circumstances affecting the league and the team.&quot; The league would itself go bankrupt not long afterward.

===Rebirth Of the VooDoo===
The Arena Football League announced that they would revive the New Orleans VooDoo for the 2010 season. On September 14, 2010, Nakia Hogan of the &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot; reported that the Bossier-Shreveport franchise would move their operation to the city of New Orleans. Jason Coffel, who would serve as the vice president of operations for the VooDoo, said owner Dan Newman would cease operations of the Battle Wings in the Bossier-Shreveport City area and immediately become the New Orleans VooDoo. &quot;The reason this is happening is the Arena Football League recognizes how passionate the New Orleans market is about football&quot;, Coffel said. &quot;Proof of that is the success of the Saints and the success of the VooDoo when they were around.&quot; The rebirth of the franchise and its renewal would not be affiliated with previous owner of the Voodoo, Tom Benson, or the New Orleans Saints.

During the 2011 season, after a home loss to the Spokane Shock, the VooDoo fired head coach Derek Stingley on June 26, 2011. He was replaced by General Manager Jon Norris. At the end of a 3–15 season, Jon Norris went back to being the General Manager. Later on August 8, 2011, he hired Pat O&#x27;Hara as the VooDoo&#x27;s third head coach.

The VooDoo started the 2012 season losing their first two games at home, to the Philadelphia Soul and Milwaukee Mustangs. This brought their home losing streak to 12, dating back to 2008, and concerned fans who did not want a possible AFL record set for futility. However, the VooDoo recovered, and gave fans starved for a winner something to hope for. Aided by a South Division where no team pulled away, a three-game winning streak, including an emotional victory over the Jacksonville Sharks put the VooDoo in first place heading into the final month of the regular season. Unfortunately, the VooDoo dropped their last three games including an overtime loss to the Tampa Bay Storm 78–77. The team backed into the playoffs with the Tampa Bay Storm losing to the Spokane Shock in the final week. The VooDoo however, fell the following week in the conference semifinals to the Philadelphia Soul, 66–53.

The VooDoo started 2013 off with a dramatic overtime win over the conference rival Orlando Predators. However, as the season progressed, inconsistent play from the offensive line led to injuries and ineffectiveness from starting quarterback Kurt Rocco, while the VooDoo struggled to replace star linebacker Alvin Ray Jackson and defensive back Jeremy Kellem. The record dropped as low as 1–8, but Rocco&#x27;s return to health has seen the VooDoo start to play better at the right time, in a conference where they never really dropped out of the race for a playoff spot. Chris Dixon took over as starting QB and led the VooDoo to 4 wins in their final 9 games, leading to a win-and-you&#x27;re-in playoff scenario for the final regular season game at Orlando. Unfortunately, the VooDoo lost 71–42 and finished their season 5–13.

2014 featured the much-ballyhooed signing of former LSU quarterback Ryan Perriloux, but Rocco was named the starter again after training camp. As the season started, injuries led to both seeing playing time early, but a poor 1–5 start has hurt the team&#x27;s playoff chances. However, the one win was against the rival Orlando Predators, and L. J. Castile has become one of the top receivers in the league.

After compiling a 16–38 in three seasons as head coach, O&#x27;Hara was not offered a new contract for 2015. The VooDoo instead announced the hiring of Alabama Hammers Head Coach, Dean Cokinos.

===League takeover===
On July 12, 2015, ArenaFan.com reported that the VooDoo and the Las Vegas Outlaws were to be taken over by the league due to poor attendance and financial issues. Both teams were expected to finish the season, then commissioner Scott Butera was to conduct a search for new owners. An unnamed investment group reportedly sought to purchase the VooDoo and move the franchise to Texas and attended the VooDoo&#x27;s final home game at Smoothie King Arena against the Tampa Bay Storm on July 18, 2015. That game was possibly the final home game for this franchise. The game with the Outlaws was cancelled and declared to be a tie, only the third such result in league history and the first resulting from a scheduled game having not actually been played. Following a league takeover of the team on July 15, 2015, on August 9, 2015, the Arena Football League announced that the New Orleans VooDoo &quot;have ceased operations effective immediately.&quot; It was also reported that the VooDoo could come back for the 2016 season with a new ownership group.

===2024 revival as the Louisiana VooDoo===

In an interview with ArenaFan.com, published in February 2023, AFL Commissioner Lee A. Hutton initially that there have been discussions with potential ownership groups in New Orleans to relaunch the VooDoo when the league resumes play in 2024. Louisiana was among the regions named by Hutton in a July 2023 announcement of the league&#x27;s inaugural locations. After Bossier City ruled itself out due to schedule conflicts, contemporary reports indicated that the league was aiming to instead put the team in Lake Charles, Louisiana. The new team, which retained the VooDoo name (as the Louisiana VooDoo), was unveiled on November 3, 2023. Though, this version is &quot;not&quot; directly tied to the original New Orleans VooDoo.

The VooDoo were to have played in Lake Charles, but relocated to Lafayette, Louisiana and would play at Blackham Coliseum instead. Reasoning for the last minute switch was the lack of communication between the team and the management of the arena, though the arena countered that the VooDoo was delinquent on rent and had failed to show proof of any insurance. The league would pay for insurance and rent for the VooDoo&#x27;s lone game at Blackham. Team operations were shut down after week two and pending lawsuits by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette who indicated plans to hold the Minnesota Myth ownership, the legal entity that effectively owned the VooDoo, liable for rent for the four remaining games the VooDoo never played. Legal action is ongoing.

<text>Thomas Milton Benson Jr. (July 12, 1927 – March 15, 2018) was an American businessman, philanthropist and sports franchise owner. He was the owner of several automobile dealerships before buying the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL) in 1985 and the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 2012.

As a sports team owner, Benson had a Super Bowl victory to his credit, via the Saints winning Super Bowl XLIV (2009).

As of October 2017, he had a net worth of US$2.8 billion according to &quot;Forbes&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Benson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Thomas Milton Benson Sr. and Carmen Pintado. After graduating from St. Aloysius in 1944, he went to enlist in the US Navy at the end of World War II in 1945. After the war ended, he went to study accounting at Loyola University New Orleans before dropping out in 1948. He then went to work as a car salesman at Cathey Chevrolet in New Orleans.

In 1956, he moved to San Antonio to try and revive a poorly performing dealership; he was granted a 25 percent interest in the dealership for his efforts. In 1962, he became full owner of Tom Benson Chevrolet. He was the owner of several automobile dealerships in the Greater New Orleans and San Antonio areas. Benson became wealthy by investing profits from his automobile dealerships in local banks. He eventually purchased several small Southern banks and formed Benson Financial, which he sold to Norwest Corporation in 1996.

===New Orleans Saints===
Benson purchased the Saints from John Mecom in 1985 after he learned from Governor Edwin W. Edwards that the team was on the verge of being sold to parties interested in moving the team to Jacksonville, Florida. Ownership of the team was officially transferred to him on May 31, 1985, with his intent that the team would stay in New Orleans.

Shortly after acquiring the Saints, Benson gained a reputation as one of the more popular and colorful owners in the league. He hired general manager Jim Finks and head coach Jim Mora, who led the Saints to their first winning season and playoff appearance.

Benson&#x27;s popularity later declined, however, after numerous attempts to persuade the state of Louisiana to construct a new stadium for the Saints to replace the aging Superdome, suggesting that he might move the team elsewhere if said stadium were not built.

His popularity hit an all-time low in late 2005 after it appeared he was trying to move the team to San Antonio after Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans. (See &quot;Saints relocation controversy&quot; below for more details.) He later stated that the Saints would return to New Orleans for the 2006 season, which they did. The team&#x27;s fortunes improved dramatically in the years after their return, including a 31–17 defeat of the Indianapolis Colts on February 7, 2010, to win Super Bowl XLIV, and Benson recovered much of his popularity as well.

On July 18, 2008, the Benson-led Louisiana Media Company consummated their purchase of WVUE-DT, the Fox affiliate for the New Orleans area and by virtue of their affiliation, the major carrier of Saints games as part of the NFL on Fox contract. Since the sale, the station has also become the &quot;de facto&quot; home of the Saints, including coach&#x27;s shows and preseason games.

Benson was well known for doing the &quot;Benson Boogie&quot; after Saints home victories. Benson, in true New Orleans fashion, would second line dance down the field of the Superdome in the closing minutes of the game while carrying an umbrella decorated in black and gold.

====Saints relocation controversy====

During the Saints&#x27; 2001 negotiations with the state of Louisiana, rumors circulated that Benson would seek relocation if his requests—which included renovations to the Superdome, a new practice facility in suburban Metairie, and escalating annual payments from the state to the team—could not be met. Though he never made public statements to this effect, Benson&#x27;s business ties to the city—and the availability of the Alamodome as a playing facility—made San Antonio the most common subject of speculation.

When it became clear that Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s extensive damage to New Orleans and the Superdome would make it impossible for the Saints to play there in 2005, the team temporarily relocated its operations to San Antonio and began negotiations to play home games at the Alamodome. (The Saints, after discussions with the NFL and Louisiana State University, eventually agreed to play one &quot;home&quot; game at Giants Stadium against the Giants, three games at the Alamodome and four games at LSU&#x27;s Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge).

At the Saints-Falcons game on October 16, the second of two warm receptions of the Saints by the San Antonio community, mayor Phil Hardberger stated that Benson had agreed to schedule negotiations for permanent relocation once the 2005 season is over. In reference to Benson, Hardberger said, &quot;I&#x27;m pretty comfortable in saying he wants to be here.&quot;

On October 17, Benson dismissed executive vice president Arnie Fielkow, who had been a public advocate of the Saints&#x27; importance to the state of Louisiana, and who had advocated the playing of home games in Baton Rouge. According to Fielkow, Benson told him that if he&#x27;d tender his resignation and sign a confidentiality agreement, he&#x27;d be paid the remainder of his contract; when he refused, he was fired outright.

Benson&#x27;s actions quickly drew outrage from Saints fans as well as local and state officials. On October 19, New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin sharply criticized Benson for acts he deemed heartless and opportunistic. Said Nagin: &quot;For them to be openly talking to other cities about moving is disrespectful to the citizens of New Orleans, disrespectful to the Saints fans who have hung in with this franchise through 30-something years under very trying times.&quot;

Two days later, Benson publicly stated that he had made no plans to move the Saints to San Antonio. &quot;There are many factors that will affect the future location of our team&quot;, Benson said. &quot;That is also true of many other New Orleans–based companies that are faced with deciding their future homes.&quot; He said he would make no decisions about the team&#x27;s future until the 2005 season was over.

On October 26, Benson reiterated his commitment to the New Orleans area in the form of a full-page ad in newspapers around the region. The ad, a letter entitled &quot;Tom Benson Wants to Return to New Orleans&quot;, acknowledged the negative reaction surrounding the team&#x27;s recent actions, but promised that no decision has been made regarding the team&#x27;s future. Said Benson in the letter, &quot;It is too early to determine, but my desire is to return to New Orleans.&quot;

Benson&#x27;s firm but noncommittal stance compared unfavorably to the statements of the then-New Orleans Hornets, the city&#x27;s displaced NBA team. Though the Hornets played all but a handful of games during the 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 seasons in Oklahoma City—and even temporarily changed the team&#x27;s name to the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, the basketball team&#x27;s ownership insisted they would return to the recovering city as soon as possible. The Hornets also announced a community relations initiative to keep the team involved in the New Orleans area.

NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue met with Benson and Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco at the Saints&#x27; first home game in Baton Rouge on October 30. After the meeting, he stopped just short of making a formal commitment to keep the Saints in New Orleans. Said Tagliabue: &quot;The Saints are Louisiana&#x27;s team and have been since the late &#x27;60s when my predecessor Pete Rozelle welcomed them to the league as New Orleans&#x27; team and Louisiana&#x27;s team. Our focus continues to be on having the Saints in Louisiana.&quot; He dispelled rumors that have the Saints relocating to Los Angeles. He also suggested that the Saints may need to focus on becoming more of a regional team, possibly implying a name change to the Louisiana Saints or the Gulf Coast Saints. Tagliabue was to form an eight-owner advisory committee to help decide the team&#x27;s future.

That same day, Benson charged New Orleans news reporter Lee Zurik with a raised hand while leaving Tiger Stadium following a Saints loss to the Miami Dolphins and lunged at the television news crew grabbing a camera and wrenching it down before being eased away by Saints security. A video also appeared to show Benson angrily responding to a heckling fan. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league would likely take no action against Benson.

On November 11, 2005, an e-mail sent to Commissioner Paul Tagliabue from Benson was leaked to the press. Benson stated in the e-mail that he feared for his life, and his family&#x27;s safety upon his exit from Tiger Stadium, and would not be returning to any future games in Baton Rouge. Benson declared in the email that security in the stadium was &quot;inadequate&quot; and claimed that his family &quot;could all have been severely injured or killed.&quot; However, LSU officials were quick to point out that they had no negative comments from the Saints or the NFL concerning Tiger Stadium security. In addition, the videotape of Benson from October 30 showed him being escorted by at least one security guard, belying his e-mail claim that security was &quot;non-existent.&quot; A day later, Saints spokesman Greg Bensel stated that Benson&#x27;s e-mail was sent in frustration, and that Benson was undecided on whether he would attend any future games in Baton Rouge. Benson did not attend the following week&#x27;s game at Tiger Stadium on November 6 against the Chicago Bears.

On November 4, 2005, Benson made a deal with Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco that would postpone two important termination deadlines in the team&#x27;s Superdome lease until after the 2006 season. Benson extended his &quot;force majeure&quot; clause period until January 2007. Presumably that stood to keep the Saints in New Orleans until January 2007; however, Benson could still have invoked the clause any time prior to then. This seemingly bought the Saints time to explore future options with state officials without having had to make a decision on the future of the franchise immediately. This also allowed the state to focus on more pressing needs in the recovery efforts from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, while allowing the Saints more time to determine whether the region&#x27;s economy could rebound enough to continue supporting the franchise.

In the midst of this controversy, several groups of investors approached Benson with offers to buy the team and keep them in Louisiana, the most publicized group being one led by Fox Sports analyst and former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw, who is a Louisiana native. However, Benson expressed then and since that he had no intentions of selling the team and planned eventually to hand down ownership to his granddaughter, Saints owner/executive Rita Benson LeBlanc. Benson spoke to press following an NFL owners&#x27; meeting on November 15, 2005, at which he reiterated that the team is not for sale, but also stated that other NFL owners, along with Tagliabue, were working with him to keep the team in New Orleans.

On December 17, ESPN reported that Benson had told Saints players that he planned to keep the Saints in San Antonio for the 2006 season and possibly beyond, and that he was willing to sue the NFL for the right to stay there. This was days after NFL Players Association executive director Gene Upshaw advised the Saints players not to renew their leases on their homes in San Antonio because the league planned to order them to return to their home facilities in Metairie. This was also a few days after Benson had reportedly told his staff that they could not return to their Metairie facilities because they were still being occupied by FEMA and National Guard officials and that the New Orleans area had become &quot;unlivable.&quot; The State of Louisiana responded by sending Benson a formal letter asking him and the Saints organization to return to the facility at the end of the 2005 season. Included with the letter were statements from FEMA and the National Guard stating that they were no longer using the facility.

On December 30, two days before the Saints&#x27; final game of the 2005 season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Benson announced at a press conference that the Saints were returning to their Metairie facility at the end of the 2005 season, and that the team would play as many of their home games as possible during the 2006 season in the Louisiana Superdome, which he said could be ready as early as mid-September, 2006. On January 11, 2006, Benson and Tagliabue announced plans to play all of their 2006 home games in the Superdome. Tagliabue also stated that the NFL was committed to keeping the Saints in New Orleans beyond 2006, calling it a &quot;multiyear effort&quot; and not just a one-year deal. He also stated that the NFL was talking with city officials about possibly hosting another Super Bowl there in the near future, which would be the city&#x27;s 10th. Benson stated that he was committed to New Orleans &quot;forever, as long as the community commits to me&quot;.

===Other===
In 1992, Benson made a deal to acquire the Charlotte Knights AA minor league baseball team and bring them to New Orleans for the 1993 season, renaming them the &quot;Pelicans&quot; after New Orleans&#x27; old minor league team, but the transaction was thwarted when the Denver Zephyrs AAA team relocated to New Orleans to make way for the major league Colorado Rockies (the team became the New Orleans Zephyrs, and were known the New Orleans Baby Cakes). At the end of the 2019 season, the team relocated to Wichita, Kansas, where they continue as the Wichita Wind Surge.

In 1998, Benson was granted a license for a team in the Arena Football League, which finally began play in 2004 as the New Orleans VooDoo. He relinquished ownership of the VooDoo on October 13, 2008, during an owners&#x27; teleconference. By this point the entire Arena Football League was in grave financial difficulty and shortly afterward filed for bankruptcy reorganization and the 2009 season was never played. A subsequent AFL team with the same name which played in the early 2010s did so without Benson&#x27;s involvement.

On April 13, 2012, Benson bought the New Orleans Hornets, now known as the New Orleans Pelicans, from the NBA for $338 million.

In 2017, Benson bought a majority stake in the Dixie Brewing Company from Joe and Kendra Bruno, with plans of returning the brewing operation to New Orleans within two years.

==Philanthropy==
The Benson family established an endowment fund at Central Catholic High School, in San Antonio, Texas, dedicated to the memory of their son Robert Carter Benson, who graduated from the school in 1966. Tom Benson also donated the Benson Memorial Library at Central Catholic. Robert Carter Benson died of cancer in 1985, at the age of 37.

Benson and his family long have been ardent supporters of University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio. The Gayle and Tom Benson Stadium officially opened on campus September 1, 2008, when the Bensons joined with more than 2,000 Cardinals fans and athletes to declare the facility ready for action. The stadium is wide enough and long enough that the Cardinals soccer teams, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s, have begun playing their games here.

Also in San Antonio, Texas, at St. Anthony Catholic School there is a Library named after Benson&#x27;s son who died of cancer.

On September 23, 2010, Benson donated $8 million to Loyola University New Orleans in what will be called the Benson Jesuit Center.

In January 2012, Benson and his wife were awarded the &quot;Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice&quot; for their generosity to Catholic Church, the highest papal honor that Catholic laypeople can receive.

In November 2012 Tom Benson and his wife, Gayle, donated $7.5 million towards the construction of Tulane University&#x27;s Yulman Stadium. The stadium, which opened in 2014, brought the Green Wave back to campus for the first time since the demolition of Tulane Stadium in 1980. The playing surface is known as Benson Field.

In November 2014, Fawcett Stadium at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, was renamed &quot;Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium&quot; in recognition of an $11 million donation by Tom Benson.

In 2015 the Benson family gave $20 million for cancer care and research.

==Personal life and death==
Benson spent his final years in the exclusive Audubon Place neighborhood in New Orleans. His brother, Larry Benson, has also been in sports ownership and owned the San Antonio Riders of the World League.

Benson was married three times. His first wife was Shirley Landry who is deceased. On November 18, 2003, his second wife, Grace Marie Trudeau Benson (born March 1, 1927), died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In October 2004, he married Gayle Marie LaJaunie Bird.

Tom Benson and his first wife Shirley adopted three children: Robert Carter Benson, Renee Benson, and Jeanne Marie Benson. Renee Benson has two adult children, Rita LeBlanc and Ryan LeBlanc. Rita Benson LeBlanc was Saints owner and executive vice president until Tom Benson fired her, her brother Ryan and her mother Renee, and wrote them out of his will. She, along with her mother Renee and brother Ryan LeBlanc, then sued Tom Benson claiming he was incompetent and for control of his companies. Benson&#x27;s only living child, as of January 2015, is Renee.

All of Benson&#x27;s property had in fact been put into a family trust whose governing terms, while undisclosed, required him to replace the shares of Saints and Pelicans stock owned by his daughter and grandchildren, with assets of equivalent value. Benson argued he did so by canceling millions of dollars&#x27; worth of debt and turning over $500 million in promissory notes due in about 25 years, but trust officials disagreed. The case was settled in 2017.

Benson was hospitalized on February 16, 2018, with the flu. Almost a month later, he died on March 15, 2018, at Ochsner Medical Center in Jefferson, Louisiana, at age 90.

==Asset controversy==
In January 2015, after Tom Benson announced that he had cut his estranged adopted daughter Renee Benson and her adult children out of his will, he was sued by Renee and Renee&#x27;s two children, Rita LeBlanc (also known as Rita Benson LeBlanc) and Ryan LeBlanc of Texas. One of Renee, Rita and Ryan&#x27;s complaints in the lawsuit is &quot;Upon information and belief, under the apparent supervision of Gayle, the diet of Tom Benson has drastically deteriorated, with him rarely consuming full, nutritious meals, but instead, for some reason, subsisting on candy, ice cream, sodas, and red wine.&quot; Renee Benson, Rita LeBlanc and Ryan LeBlanc are suing for control of Tom Benson&#x27;s companies including the NFL&#x27;s New Orleans Saints and the NBA&#x27;s Pelicans, claiming he was &quot;incompetent&quot;.

Benson released a statement saying that the lawsuit and claims against him by his adoptive daughter and her children were false and meritless. In February 2015, Probate Court Judge Tom Rickhoff named former San Antonio Mayor Phil Hardberger and attorney Art Bayern as co-executors of the testamentary trust of Shirley L. Benson, replacing Benson as trustees of the estate. On June 18, 2015, a judge found him competent.

On February 19, 2016, Judge Rickhoff approved the appointment of Renee Benson, Benson&#x27;s estranged adopted daughter, as administrator of the $1 billion Shirley Benson Testamentary Trust, which includes the Lone Star Capital Bank in San Antonio, half of five automobile dealerships, part of a large ranch near Johnson City, Texas, a home at Lake Tahoe, Nevada, an airplane, and cash and other real estate holdings.

Benson&#x27;s attorney said his client, after much wrangling and two weeks of mediation, chose to settle the dispute so as to live his remaining time at peace and to relieve himself of a hefty tax burden required on those assets.

<doc id="341583" wikidata="Q464168" url="?curid=341583" title="Samuel Bentham">
<text>Brigadier General Sir Samuel Bentham (11 January 1757 – 31 May 1831) was an English mechanical engineer and naval architect credited with numerous innovations, particularly related to naval architecture, including weapons. He was the only surviving sibling of philosopher Jeremy Bentham, with whom he had a close bond.

==Early life==
Samuel Bentham was one of two surviving children of Jeremiah Bentham. His father was an attorney, and his older brother was the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, five other siblings having died in infancy or early childhood, and their mother dying in 1766. At the age of 14, Bentham was apprenticed to a shipwright at Woolwich Dockyard, serving there and at Chatham Dockyard, before completing his 7-year training at the Naval Academy in Portsmouth.

==Career==

===Russia===
In 1780 he moved to Russia, where he was employed in the service of Prince Potemkin, who had an establishment designed to promote the introduction of various arts of civilization. Initially hired as a shipbuilder, he soon discovered other opportunities to use his talents as an engineer and inventor, constructing industrial machinery and experimenting with steel production. He also designed and constructed many novel inventions, including an amphibious vessel and an articulated barge built for Catherine the Great, and the first Panopticon.

He was also decorated for his part in a decisive victory in the war against the Turks, and commanded a battalion of 1,000 men in Siberia. He eventually came to have complete responsibility for Potemkin&#x27;s factories and workshops, and it was while considering the difficulties of supervising the large workforce that he devised the principle of central inspection, and designed the Panopticon building which would embody that principle and was later popularized by his brother Jeremy.

In 1782 Bentham travelled along the Siberian route to China, visiting Kyakhta and its Chinese pendant Naimatchin, and then spending over a month at the border fluvial city of Nerchinsk, where he was able to study Chinese ship designs, particularly those of junks. Back in Europe, he campaigned for the introduction of watertight compartments, an idea which he acknowledged he had got from seeing large Chinese vessels in Siberia.

Samuel returned to England in 1791, and for the next few years was involved with his brother Jeremy in trying to promote the Panopticon scheme and he designed machinery for use in it. It was during this period that he met his future wife, Mary Sophia Fordyce, the daughter of Scottish doctor and scientist George Fordyce, a friend of Jeremy Bentham. The two were married in October 1796.

In 1795 the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty asked him to design six new sailing ships with &quot;partitions contributing to strength, and securing the ship against foundering, as practiced by the Chinese of the present day&quot;. These were built by the shipyard of Hobbs &amp; Hellyer at Redbridge, Hampshire, and incorporated a number of other novel features such as interchangeable parts for masts and spars, allowing easy maintenance while at sea.

===Inspector General of Naval Works===
In March 1796 Bentham was appointed Inspector General of Naval Works, responsible for the maintaining and improving the Royal dockyards, a post which involved a lot of travel. He produced a great many suggestions for improvements, which included the introduction of steam power to the dockyards and the mechanisation of many production processes. However, his superiors at the Navy Board were resistant to change and many of his suggestions were not implemented.
Bentham is credited with helping to revolutionise the production of the wooden pulley blocks used in ships&#x27; rigging, devising woodworking machinery to improve production efficiency. Bentham&#x27;s 1793 patent for woodworking machinery has been called &quot;one of the most remarkable patents ever issued by the British Patent Office&quot;. Fifty years later in a woodworking machinery patent case the Crown Judges said &quot;the specification of his patent of 1793 is a perfect treatise on the subject; indeed the only one worth quoting that has to this day been written on the subject&quot;.

Marc Isambard Brunel had independently conceived designs for mortising and boring machines, which he showed to Bentham, who recognized the superiority of Brunel&#x27;s designs. Henry Maudslay, the mechanic who built the machines, became a prominent machine tool builder. The Portsmouth Block Mills marked the arrival of mass production techniques in British manufacturing.

===Return to Russia===
In 1805 Bentham returned to Russia, this time on government business, and remained there for two years with his family, chartering an entire ship to take his establishment, his servants and his companions. Samuel&#x27;s mission for the British government in Russia was blocked by constant obstacles and he returned home in 1807 without having achieved any of his official objectives. During this time he supervised the construction of a &quot;Panopticon School of Arts&quot; on the banks of the Okhta River in St. Petersburg, the design which he had first conceived while in Krichev in 1786. The building was destroyed by fire and is known only from drawings.

===Vauxhall Bridge===

Bentham also designed a full cast-iron nine-arch bridge for the Butterly company, for Vauxhall Bridge in London, which would have been the first iron-built bridge over the Thames. The choice of cast iron was said to be because it was &quot;cheaper than masonry&quot;, but some of the inspiration for the bridge has also been traced to Bentham&#x27;s experience of China, where numerous such arched iron-cast bridges existed. The design was eventually abandoned after doubts about its quality, in favour of a &quot;cast iron arches on masonry piers&quot; design by James Walker, which was completed in May 1813.

===France===
Bentham discovered upon his return to England that his post as Inspector General had been abolished while he was absent, and indeed came to believe that he had been sent to Russia solely to get him out of the way while the post was abolished. In 1814, he and his family relocated to the south of France, where they lived until 1826.

The Bentham family travelled a great deal in France before settling in 1820 at the Château de Restinclières, in the &quot;région&quot; of Languedoc-Roussillon. Their new house was large, with extensive grounds, and Bentham planned to cultivate the land for profit, with his son George managing most of the operation. Bentham also imported agricultural machinery as yet unknown in France, and installed a complex system of irrigation on his land. They were reasonably prosperous, but eventually returned to England in 1826. One factor in their decision was a threatened lawsuit from neighbouring farmers, who claimed that Bentham&#x27;s irrigation system was diverting the local water supply.

In England, Bentham spent most of his time writing about naval matters, and conducting experiments on hull shapes. His son George Bentham, born in 1800, became a noted botanist.

<text>Since the first human spaceflight by the Soviet Union, citizens of 48 countries have flown in space. For each nationality, the launch date of the first mission is listed. The list is based on the nationality of the person at the time of the launch. Only 7 of 48 countries have been represented by female &quot;first flyers&quot; (Helen Sharman for the United Kingdom in 1991, Anousheh Ansari for Iran in 2006, Yi So-yeon for South Korea in 2008, Sara Sabry for Egypt in 2022, and Keisha Schahaff and Anastatia Mayers for Antigua and Barbuda in 2023, Namira Salim for Pakistan in 2023 and Marina Vasilevskaya for Belarus in 2024). Only three nations (Soviet Union/Russia, U.S., China) have launched their own crewed spacecraft, with the Soviets/Russians and the American programs providing rides to other nations&#x27; astronauts. Twenty-eight &quot;first flights&quot; occurred on Soviet or Russian flights while the United States carried nineteen.

==Timeline==
Note: All dates given are UTC. Countries indicated in bold have achieved independent human spaceflight capability.

==Notes==
==Other claims==
The above list uses the nationality at the time of launch. Lists with differing criteria might include the following people:

<doc id="341594" wikidata="Q2469058" url="?curid=341594" title="Land reform in Zimbabwe">
<text>Land reform in [[Zimbabwe]] officially began in 1980 with the signing of the Lancaster House Agreement, as a program to redistribute farmland from white Zimbabweans to black Zimbabweans as an effort by the ZANU-PF government to give more control over the country&#x27;s extensive farmlands to the black African majority. Before the implementation of these policies, the distribution of land in what was then known as Rhodesia saw a population of 4,400 white Rhodesians owning 51% of the country&#x27;s land while 4.3 million black Rhodesians owned 42%, with the remainder being non-agricultural land. The discrepancy of this distribution, as well as the overall dominance of the white population in the newly-independent but largely unrecognized Rhodesian state was challenged by the black nationalist organizations ZANU and ZAPU in the Rhodesian Bush War. At the establishment of the modern Zimbabwean state in 1980 after the bush war, the Lancaster House Agreement held a clause that prohibited forced transfer of land, this resulted in changes in land distribution from the willing sale or transfer by owners being minor until 2000, when the government of Robert Mugabe began a more aggressive policy. 

The government&#x27;s land reform policy is perhaps the most controversial and contested political issue surrounding Zimbabwe. It has been criticised for the violence and intimidation which marred several expropriations, as well as the parallel collapse of domestic banks which held billions of dollars&#x27; worth of bonds on liquidated properties. The United Nations has identified several key shortcomings with the contemporary programme, namely failure to compensate ousted landowners as called for by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the poor handling of boundary disputes, and chronic shortages of material and personnel needed to carry out resettlement in an orderly manner. Several farm owners and even more farm workers have been killed during violent takeovers.

Land reform has had a serious negative effect on the Zimbabwean economy and is argued to have heavily contributed to its collapse in the 2000s. There has been a drop in total farm output which has led to instances of starvation and famine. Increasing poverty levels combined with the increased informality of farming operations amongst farmers who received redistributed land has led to an increase in the use of child labour especially in the growing of sugar cane.

As of 2011, 237,858 Zimbabwean households had been provided with access to land under the programme. A total of 10,816,886 hectares had been acquired since 2000, compared to the 3,498,444 purchased from voluntary sellers between 1980 and 1998. By 2013, every white-owned farm in Zimbabwe had been either expropriated or confirmed for future redistribution. The compulsory acquisition of farmland without compensation was discontinued in early 2018. In 2019, the Commercial Farmers Union stated that white farmers who had land expropriated under the fast track program had agreed to accept an interim compensation offer by the Zimbabwean government of RTGS$53 million (US$17 million) as part of the government effort to compensate dispossessed farmers. A year later, the Zimbabwean government announced that it would be compensating dispossessed white farmers for infrastructure investments in the land and had committed to pay out US$3.5 billion. Compensation efforts continued in 2024.

==Background==
The foundation for the controversial land dispute in Zimbabwean society was laid at the beginning of European settlement of the region, which had long been the scene of mass movements by various Bantu peoples. In the sixteenth century, Portuguese explorers had attempted to open up Zimbabwe for trading purposes, but the country was not permanently settled by European immigrants until three hundred years later. The first great Zimbabwean kingdom was the Rozwi Empire, established in the eleventh century. Two hundred years later, Rozwi imperial rule began to crumble and the empire fell to the Karanga peoples, a relatively new tribe to the region which originated north of the Zambezi River. Both these peoples later came to form the nucleus of the Shona civilisation, along with the Zezuru in central Zimbabwe, the Korekore in the north, the Manyika in the east, the Ndau in the southeast, and the Kalanga in the southwest.

Most Shona cultures had a theoretically communal attitude towards land ownership; the later European concept of officiating individual property ownership was unheard of. Land was considered the collective property of all the residents in a given chiefdom, with the chief mediating disagreements and issues pertaining to its use. Nevertheless, male household heads frequently reserved personal tracts for their own cultivation, and allocated smaller tracts to each of their wives. Population growth frequently resulted in the over-utilisation of the existing land, which became greatly diminished both in terms of cultivation and grazing due to the larger number of people attempting to share the same acreage.

During the early nineteenth century, the Shona were conquered by the Northern Ndebele (also known as the &quot;Matabele&quot;), which began the process of commodifying Zimbabwe&#x27;s land. Although the Ndebele elite were uninterested in cultivation, land ownership was considered one major source of an individual&#x27;s wealth and power—the others being cattle and slaves. Ndebele monarchs acquired large swaths of land for themselves accordingly.

Land hunger was at the centre of the Rhodesian Bush War, and was addressed at Lancaster House, which sought to concede equitable redistribution to the landless without damaging the white farmers&#x27; vital contribution to Zimbabwe&#x27;s economy. At independence from the United Kingdom in 1980, the Zimbabwean authorities were empowered to initiate the necessary reforms; as long as land was bought and sold on a willing basis, the British government would finance half the cost. In the late 1990s, Prime Minister Tony Blair terminated this arrangement when funds available from Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s administration were exhausted, repudiating all commitments to land reform. Zimbabwe responded by embarking on a &quot;fast track&quot; redistribution campaign, forcibly confiscating white farms without compensation.

===Legal situation in Southern Rhodesia===

====European settlement patterns====
The first white colonists to settle in modern-day Zimbabwe arrived during the 19th century, primarily from the Cape Colony (modern-day South Africa), less than a century after the Ndebele invasions. This reflected a larger trend of permanent European settlement in the milder, drier regions of Southern Africa as opposed to the tropical and sub-tropical climates further north. In 1889 Cecil Rhodes and the British South Africa Company (BSAC) introduced the earliest white settlers to Zimbabwe as prospectors, seeking concessions from the Ndebele for mineral rights. Collectively known as the &quot;Pioneer Column&quot;, the settlers established the city of Salisbury, now Harare. Rhodes hoped to discover gold and establish a mining colony, but the original intention had to be modified as neither the costs nor the returns on the overhead capital matched the original projections. Local gold deposits failed to yield the massive returns which the BSAC had promised its investors, and the military costs of the expedition had caused a deficit. An interim solution was the granting of land to the settlers in the hopes that they would develop productive farms and generate enough income to justify the colony&#x27;s continued administrative costs. The region was demarcated as &quot;Southern Rhodesia&quot; after 1898.

Between 1890 and 1896, the BSAC granted an area encompassing 16 million acres—about one sixth the area of Southern Rhodesia—to European immigrants. By 1913 this had been extended to 21.5 million acres. However, these concessions were strictly regulated, and land was only offered to those individuals able to prove they had the necessary capital to develop it. Exceptions were made during the Ndebele and Shona insurrections against the BSAC in the mid-1890s, when land was promised to any European men willing to take up arms in defence of the colony, irrespective of their financial status. The settlers of the Pioneer Column were granted tracts of 3,150 acres apiece, with an option to purchase more land from the BSAC&#x27;s holdings at relatively low prices (up to fifteen times cheaper than comparable land on the market in South Africa).

====Creation of the Tribal Trust Lands====

Friction soon arose between the settlers and the Ndebele and Shona peoples, both in terms of land apportionment and economic competition. In 1900, Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s black population owned an estimated 55,000 head of cattle, while European residents owned fewer than 12,000. Most of the pastureland was being grazed by African-owned cattle, accordingly. However, in less than two decades the Ndebele and Shona came to own over a million head of cattle, with white farmers owning another million as well. As the amount of available pasture for the livestock quickly dwindled, accompanied by massive amounts of overgrazing and erosion, land competition between the three groups became intense. A number of successive land commissions were thus appointed to study the problem and apportion the land.

The colonial government in Southern Rhodesia delineated the country into five distinct farming regions which corresponded roughly to rainfall patterns. Region I comprised an area in the eastern highlands with markedly higher rainfall best suited to the cultivation of diversified cash crops such as coffee and tea. Region II was highveld, also in the east, where the land could be used intensively for grain cultivation such as maize, tobacco, and wheat. Region III and Region IV endured periodic drought and were regarded as suitable for livestock, in addition to crops which required little rainfall. Region V was lowveld and unsuitable for crop cultivation due to its dry nature; however, limited livestock farming was still viable. Land ownership in these regions was determined by race under the terms of the Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act, passed in 1930, which reserved Regions I, II, and III for white settlement. Region V and a segment of Region II which possessed greater rainfall variability were organised into the Tribal Trust Lands (TTLs), reserved solely for black African ownership and use. This created two new problems: firstly, in the areas reserved for whites, the ratio of land to population was so high that many farms could not be exploited to their fullest potential, and some prime white-owned farmland was lying idle. Secondly, the legislation resulted in enforced overuse of the land in the TTLs due to overpopulation there.

The Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act reserved 49 million acres for white ownership and left 17.7 million acres of land unassigned to either the white preserve or the TTLs. While a survey undertaken by the colony&#x27;s Land Commission in concert with the British government in 1925 found that the vast majority of black Rhodesians supported some form of geographic segregation, including the reservation of land exclusively for their use, many were disillusioned by the manner in which the legislation was implemented in explicit favour of whites. The overcrowded conditions in the TTLs compelled large numbers of Shona and Ndebele alike to abandon their rural livelihoods and seek wage employment in the cities or on white commercial farms. Those who remained on tracts in the TTLs found themselves having to cope with topsoil depletion due to overuse; large amounts of topsoil were stripped of their vegetation cover and rendered unproductive as a consequence. To control the rate of erosion, colonial authorities introduced voluntary destocking initiatives for livestock. When these met with little success, the destocking programme became mandatory in 1941, forcing all residents of the TTLs to sell or slaughter animals declared surplus. Another 7.2 million acres were also set aside for sale to black farmers, known as the Native Purchase Areas.

During the early 1950s, Southern Rhodesia passed the African Land Husbandry Act, which attempted to reform the communal system in the TTLs by giving black Africans the right to apply for formal title deeds to specific tracts. This legislation proved so unpopular and difficult to enforce that incoming Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith ordered its suspension in the mid-1960s. Smith&#x27;s administration subsequently recognised the traditional leaders of each chiefdom as the final authority on land allocation in the TTLs.

Following Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence, land legislation was again amended with the Rhodesian Land Tenure Act of 1969. The Land Tenure Act upended the Land Apportionment Act of 1930 and was designed to rectify the issue of insufficient land available to the rapidly expanding black population. It reduced the amount of land reserved for white ownership to 45 million acres and reserved another 45 million acres for black ownership, introducing parity in theory; however, the most fertile farmland in Regions I, II, and III continued to be included in the white enclave. Abuses of the system continued to abound; some white farmers took advantage of the legislation to shift their property boundaries into land formerly designated for black settlement, often without notifying the other landowners. A related phenomenon was the existence of black communities, especially those congregated around missions, which were oblivious to the legislation and unwittingly squatting on land redesignated for white ownership. The land would be sold in the meantime, and the government obliged to evict the preexisting occupants. These incidents and others were instrumental in eliciting sympathy among Rhodesia&#x27;s black population for nationalist movements such as the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU), which sought to overthrow the Rhodesian government by force of arms.

====The Bush War and Lancaster House====

The escalation of the Rhodesian Bush War in the 1970s led to a significant amount of rural displacement and interrupted agricultural activity. The disruption of veterinary services resulted in massive livestock losses, and the cultivation of cash crops was hampered by guerrilla raids. The murder of about three hundred white farmers during the war, as well as the conscription of hundreds of others into the Rhodesian Security Forces, also led to a drop in the volume of agricultural production. Between 1975 and 1976 Rhodesia&#x27;s urban population doubled as thousands of rural dwellers, mostly from TTLs, fled to the cities to escape the fighting. A campaign of systematic villagisation followed as the Rhodesian Army shifted segments of the black population into guarded settlements to prevent their subversion by the insurgents.

In 1977, the Land Tenure Act was amended by the Rhodesian parliament, which further reduced the amount of land reserved for white ownership to 200,000 hectares, or 500,000 acres. Over 15 million hectares were thus opened to purchase by persons of any race. Two years later, as part of the Internal Settlement, Zimbabwe Rhodesia&#x27;s incoming biracial government under Bishop Abel Muzorewa abolished the reservation of land according to race. White farmers continued to own 73.8% of the most fertile land suited for intensive cash crop cultivation and livestock grazing, in addition to generating 80% of the country&#x27;s total agricultural output. This was a vital contribution to the economy, which was still underpinned by its agricultural exports.

Land reform emerged as a critical issue during the Lancaster House Talks to end the Rhodesian Bush War. ZANU leader Robert Mugabe and ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo insisted on the redistribution of land—by compulsory seizure, without compensation—as a precondition to a negotiated peace settlement. This was reflective of prevailing attitudes in their guerrilla armies, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) respectively, and rural support bases, which had high expectations of the redistribution of land. The British government, which mediated the talks, proposed a constitutional clause underscoring property ownership as an inalienable right to prevent a mass exodus of white farmers and the economic collapse of the country. This was enshrined in Section 16 of the Zimbabwean Constitution, 1980. To secure Mugabe and Nkomo&#x27;s support for the constitutional agreement, Lord Carrington announced that the United Kingdom would be prepared to assist land resettlement with technical assistance and financial aid. The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth of Nations, Sir Shridath Ramphal, also received assurances from the American ambassador in London, Kingman Brewster, that the United States would likewise contribute capital for &quot;a substantial amount for a process of land redistribution and they would undertake to encourage the British government to give similar assurances&quot;.

The Lancaster House Agreement stipulated that farms could only be taken from whites on a &quot;willing buyer, willing seller&quot; principle for at least ten years. White farmers were not to be placed under any pressure or intimidation, and if they decided to sell their farms they were allowed to determine their own asking prices. Exceptions could be made if the farm was unoccupied and not being used for agricultural activity.

Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s independence was finally recognised as the Republic of Zimbabwe on April 18, 1980. As Zimbabwe&#x27;s first prime minister, Mugabe reaffirmed his commitment to land reform. The newly created Zimbabwean Ministry of Lands, Resettlement, and Redevelopment announced later that year that land reform would be necessary to alleviate overpopulation in the former TTLs, extend the production potential of small-scale subsistence farmers, and improve the standards of living of rural blacks. Its stated goals were to ensure abandoned or under-utilised land was being exploited to its fullest potential, and provide opportunities for unemployed, landless peasants.

=== Post-independence ===
Inequalities in land ownership were inflated by a growing overpopulation problem, depletion of over-utilised tracts, and escalating poverty in subsistence areas parallel with the under-utilisation of land on commercial farms. The predominantly white commercial sector used the labor of over 30% of the paid workforce and accounted for some 40% of exports. Its principal crops included sugarcane, coffee, cotton, tobacco and several varieties of high-yield hybrid maize. Both the commercial farms and the subsistence sector maintained large cattle herds, but over 60% of domestic beef was furnished by the former. In sharp contrast, the life of typical subsistence farmers was difficult, and their labour poorly rewarded. As erosion increased, the ability of the subsistence sector to feed its adherents diminished greatly.

==Phases of land reform==

===Willing Seller, Willing Buyer===
Despite extensive financial assistance from the UK, the first phase of Zimbabwe&#x27;s land reform programme was widely regarded as unsuccessful. Zimbabwe was only able to acquire 3 million hectares (7.41 million acres) for black resettlement, well short of its intended target of 8 million hectares (19.77 million acres). This land was redistributed to about 50,000 households. Many former supporters of the nationalist movements felt that the promises of Nkomo and Mugabe with regards to the land had not been truly fulfilled. This sentiment was especially acute in Matabeleland, where the legacy of the Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act was more disadvantageous to black Zimbabweans than other parts of the country.

Funds earmarked for the purchase of white farms were frequently diverted into defence expenditure throughout the mid-1980s, for which Zimbabwean officials received some criticism. Reduction of funding posed another dilemma: property prices were now beyond what the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement, and Redevelopment could afford to meet its goals. It was also unable to build sufficient roads, clinics, and schools for the large number of people it was resettling in new areas. After 1983, the domestic budget could no longer sustain resettlement measures, and despite British aid the number of farms being purchased gradually declined for the remainder of the decade.

In 1986, the government of Zimbabwe cited financial restraints and an ongoing drought as the two overriding factors influencing the slow progress of land reform. However, it was also clear that within the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement, and Redevelopment itself there was a lack of initiative and trained personnel to plan and implement mass resettlements. Parliament passed the Land Acquisition Act in 1985, which gave the government first right to purchase excess land for redistribution to the landless. It empowered the government to claim tracts adjacent to the former TTLs (now known simply as &quot;Communal Areas&quot;) and mark them for resettlement purposes, provided the owners could be persuaded to sell.

Between April 1980 and September 1987, the acreage of land occupied by white-owned commercial farms was reduced by about 20%.

===Compulsory acquisition===
After the expiration of the entrenched constitutional conditions mandated by the Lancaster House Agreement in the early 1990s, Zimbabwe outlined several ambitious new plans for land reform. A National Land Policy was formally proposed and enshrined as the Zimbabwean Land Acquisition Act of 1992, which empowered the government to acquire any land as it saw fit, although only after payment of financial compensation. While powerless to challenge the acquisition itself, landowners were permitted some lateral to negotiate their compensation amounts with the state. The British government continued to help fund the resettlement programme, with aid specifically earmarked for land reform reaching £91 million by 1996. Another £100 million was granted for &quot;budgetary support&quot; and was spent on a variety of projects, including land reform. Zimbabwe also began to court other donors through its Economic Structural Adjustment Policies (ESAP), which were projects implemented in concert with international agencies and tied to foreign loans.

The diversion of farms for personal use by Zimbabwe&#x27;s political elite began to emerge as a crucial issue during the mid-1990s. Prime Minister Mugabe, who assumed an executive presidency in 1987, had urged restraint by enforcing a leadership code of conduct which barred members of the ruling party, ZANU–PF, from monopolising large tracts of farmland and then renting them out for profit. Local media outlets soon exposed huge breaches of the code by Mugabe&#x27;s family and senior officials in ZANU–PF. Despite calls for accountability, the party members were never disciplined. Instead of being resettled by landless peasants, several hundred commercial farms acquired under the Land Acquisition Act continued to be leased out by politically connected individuals. In 1994, a disproportionate amount of the land being acquired was held by fewer than 600 black landowners, many of whom owned multiple properties. One study of commercial farms found that over half the redistributed land that year went to absentee owners otherwise unengaged in agriculture.

The perceived monopolisation of land by the ruling party provoked intense opposition from the ESAP donor states, which argued that those outside the patronage of ZANU-PF were unlikely to benefit. In 1996, party interests became even more inseparable from the issue of land reform when President Mugabe gave ZANU–PF&#x27;s central committee overriding powers—superseding those of the Zimbabwean courts as well as the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture—to delegate on property rights. That year all farms marked for redistribution were no longer chosen or discussed by government ministries, but at ZANU–PF&#x27;s annual congress.

In 1997 the government published a list of 1,471 farms it intended to buy compulsorily for redistribution. The list was compiled via a nationwide land identification exercise undertaken throughout the year. Landowners were given thirty days to submit written objections. Many farms were delisted and then re-listed as the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture debated the merits of acquiring various properties, especially those which ZANU–PF had ordered be expropriated for unspecified &quot;political reasons&quot;. Of the 1,471 individual property acquisitions, about 1,200 were appealed to the courts by the farmowners due to various legal irregularities. President Mugabe responded by indicating that in his opinion land reform was a strictly political issue, not one to be questioned or debated by the judiciary.

The increasing politicisation of land reform was accompanied by the deterioration of diplomatic relations between Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom. Public opinion on the Zimbabwean land reform process among British citizens was decidedly mediocre; it was perceived as a poor investment on the part of the UK&#x27;s government in an ineffectual and shoddily implemented programme. In June 1996, Lynda Chalker, British secretary of state for international development, declared that she could not endorse the new compulsory acquisition policy and urged Mugabe to return to the principles of &quot;willing buyer, willing seller&quot;.

On 5 November 1997, Chalker&#x27;s successor, Clare Short, described the new Labour government&#x27;s approach to Zimbabwean land reform. She said that the UK did not accept that Britain had a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe. Notwithstanding the Lancaster House commitments, Short stated that her government was only prepared to support a programme of land reform that was part of a poverty eradication strategy. She had other questions regarding the way in which land would be acquired and compensation paid, and the transparency of the process. Her government&#x27;s position was spelt out in a letter to Zimbabwe&#x27;s Agriculture Minister, Kumbirai Kangai:

:&quot;I should make it clear that we do not accept that Britain has a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe. We are a new government from diverse backgrounds without links to former colonial interests. My own origins are Irish and, as you know, we were colonised, not colonisers.&quot;

The letter concluded by stating that a programme of rapid land acquisition would be impossible to support, citing concern about the damage which this might do to Zimbabwe&#x27;s agricultural output and its prospects of attracting investment.

Kenneth Kaunda, former president of Zambia, responded dismissively by saying &quot;when Tony Blair took over in 1997, I understand that some young lady in charge of colonial issues within that government simply dropped doing anything about it.&quot;

In June 1998, the Zimbabwe government published its &quot;policy framework&quot; on the Land Reform and Resettlement Programme Phase II (LRRP II), which envisaged the compulsory purchase over five years of 50,000 square kilometres from the 112,000 square kilometres owned by white commercial farmers, public corporations, churches, non-governmental organisations and multinational companies. Broken down, the 50,000 square kilometres meant that every year between 1998 and 2003, the government intended to purchase 10,000 square kilometres for redistribution.

In September 1998, the government called a donors conference in Harare on LRRP II to inform the donor community and involve them in the program: Forty-eight countries and international organisations attended and unanimously endorsed the land program, saying it was essential for poverty reduction, political stability and economic growth. They agreed that the inception phase, covering the first 24 months, should start immediately, particularly appreciating the political imperative and urgency of the proposal.

The Commercial Farmers Union freely offered to sell the government 15,000 square kilometres for redistribution, but landowners once again dragged their feet. In response to moves by the National Constitutional Assembly, a group of academics, trade unionists and other political activists, the government drafted a new constitution. The draft was discussed widely by the public in formal meetings and amended to include restrictions on presidential powers, limits to the presidential term of office, and an age limit of 70 for presidential candidates. This was not seen as a suitable outcome for the government, so the proposals were amended to replace those clauses with one to compulsorily acquire land for redistribution without compensation. The opposition mostly boycotted the drafting stage of the constitution claiming that this new version was to entrench Mugabe politically.

Guerrilla veterans of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) began to emerge as a radical force in the land issue around this time. The guerrillas forcefully presented their position that white-owned land in Zimbabwe was rightfully theirs, on account of promises made to them during the Rhodesian Bush War. Calls for accelerated land reform were also echoed by an affluent urban class of black Zimbabweans who were interested in making inroads into commercial farming, with public assistance.

===Fast-track land reform and violence===
The government held a referendum on the new constitution on 12–13 February 2000, despite having a sufficiently large majority in parliament to pass any amendment it wished. Had it been approved, the new constitution would have empowered the government to acquire land compulsorily without compensation. Despite vast support in the media, the new constitution was defeated, 55% to 45%.

On 26–27 February 2000, the pro-Mugabe Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA) organised several people (including but not limited to war veterans; many of them were their children and grandchildren) to march on white-owned farmlands, initially with drums, song and dance. This movement was officially termed the &quot;Fast-Track Land Reform Program&quot; (FTLRP). The predominantly white farm owners were forced off their lands along with their workers, who were typically of regional descent. This was often done violently and without compensation. In this first wave of farm invasions, a total of 110,000 square kilometres of land had been seized. Several million black farm workers were excluded from the redistribution, leaving them without employment. According to Human Rights Watch, by 2002 the War Veterans Association had &quot;killed white farm owners in the course of occupying commercial farms&quot; on at least seven occasions, in addition to &quot;several tens of [black] farm workers&quot;. The first white farmers to die as a direct consequence of the resettlement programme were murdered by Zimbabwean paramilitaries in mid-2000. More commonly, violence was directed against farmworkers, who were often assaulted and killed by the war veterans and their supporters. Violent confrontations between the farmers and the war veterans occurred and resulted in exchanges of gunfire, as well as a state of armed siege on the affected farms.

Officially the land was divided into small-holder production, so called A1 schemes and commercial farms, called A2 schemes. There is however much overlap between the two categories.

The violent takeover of Alamein Farm by retired Army General Solomon Mujuru sparked the first legal action against one of Robert Mugabe&#x27;s inner circle. In late 2002 the seizure was ruled illegal by the High and Supreme Courts of Zimbabwe; however the previous owner was unable to effect the court orders and General Mujuru continued living at the farm until his death on 15 August 2011. Many other legal challenges to land acquisition or to eviction were not successful.

On 10 June 2004, a spokesperson for the British embassy, Sophie Honey, said:

:&quot;The UK has not reneged on commitments (made) at Lancaster House. At Lancaster House the British Government made clear that the long-term requirements of land reform in Zimbabwe were beyond the capacity of any individual donor country.&quot;
:&quot;Since [Zimbabwe&#x27;s] independence we have provided 44 million pounds for land reform in Zimbabwe and 500 million pounds in bilateral development assistance.&quot;
:&quot;The UK remains a strong advocate for effective, well managed and pro-poor land reform. Fast-track land reform has not been implemented in line with these principles and we cannot support it.&quot;

The Minister for Lands, Land Reform and Resettlement, John Nkomo, had declared five days earlier that all land, from crop fields to wildlife conservancies, would soon become state property. Farmland deeds would be replaced with 99-year leases, while leases for wildlife conservancies would be limited to 25 years. There have since been denials of this policy, however.

Parliament, dominated by ZANU–PF, passed a constitutional amendment, signed into law on 12 September 2005, that nationalised farmland acquired through the &quot;Fast Track&quot; process and deprived original landowners of the right to challenge in court the government&#x27;s decision to expropriate their land. The Supreme Court of Zimbabwe ruled against legal challenges to this amendment. The case (&quot;Campbell v Republic of Zimbabwe&quot;) was heard by the SADC Tribunal in 2008, which held that the Zimbabwean government violated the SADC treaty by denying access to the courts and engaging in racial discrimination against white farmers whose lands had been confiscated and that compensation should be paid. However, the High Court refused to register the Tribunal&#x27;s judgment and ultimately, Zimbabwe withdrew from the Tribunal in August 2009.

In January 2006, Agriculture Minister Joseph Made said Zimbabwe was considering legislation that would compel commercial banks to finance black peasants who had been allocated formerly white-owned farmland in the land reforms. Made warned that banks failing to lend a substantial portion of their income to these farmers would have their licenses withdrawn.

The newly resettled peasants had largely failed to secure loans from commercial banks because they did not have title over the land on which they were resettled, and thus could not use it as collateral. With no security of tenure on the farms, banks have been reluctant to extend loans to the new farmers, many of whom do not have much experience in commercial farming, nor assets to provide alternative collateral for any borrowed money.

==Aftermath and outcomes==

===Land redistribution===

Conflicting reports emerged regarding the effects of Mugabe&#x27;s land reform programme. In February 2000, the African National Congress media liaison department reported that Mugabe had given himself 15 farms, while Simon Muzenda received 13. Cabinet ministers held 160 farms among them, sitting ZANU–PF parliamentarians 150, and the 2,500 war veterans only two. Another 4,500 landless peasants were allocated three. The programme also left another 200,000 farmworkers displaced and homeless, with just under 5% receiving compensation in the form of land expropriated from their ousted employers.

The Institute of Development Studies of the University of Sussex published a report countering that the Zimbabwean economy is recovering and that new business is growing in the rural areas. The study reported that of around 7 million hectares of land redistributed via the land reform (or 20% of Zimbabwe&#x27;s area), 49.9% of those who received land were rural peasants, 18.3% were &quot;unemployed or in low-paid jobs in regional towns, growth points and mines,&quot; 16.5% were civil servants, and 6.7% were of the Zimbabwean working class. Despite the claims by critics of the land reform only benefiting government bureaucrats, only 4.8% of the land went to business people, and 3.7% went to security services. About 5% of the households (not the same as 5% of the land) went to absentee farmers well connected to ZANU-PF. Masvingo is however a part of the country with relatively poor farming land, and it is possible more farms went to &quot;cell-phone farmers&quot; in other parts of the country, according to the study. The study has been criticised for focusing on detailed local cases in one province (Masvingo Province) and ignoring the violent nature of resettlement and aspects of international law. Critics continue to maintain that the primary beneficiaries are Mugabe loyalists.

As of 2011, there were around 300 white farmers remaining in Zimbabwe. In 2018 in the ZANU–PF Central Committee Report for the 17th Annual National People&#x27;s Conference the government stated that the process of land reform suffered from corruption and &quot;vindictive processes&quot; that needed to be resolved.

After close to two decades, Zimbabwe has started the process of returning land to farmers whose farms were taken over. With the United States demanding the country must return the land before it can lift the sanctions it has imposed on the once flourishing southern Africa country, Zimbabwe stated they will begin paying compensation to white farmers who lost their farms.But most have not received compensation to date. In 2020, there are many more than 1000 white farmers tilling the soil, and this number is rising.

On 1 September 2020, Zimbabwe decided to return land that was seized from foreigners between 2000 and 2001; hence, foreign citizens who had their land seized, mostly Dutch, British and German nationals, could apply to get it back. The government also mentioned that black farmers who received land under the controversial land reform program would be moved to allow the former owners &quot;to regain possession&quot;.

===Impact on production===

Before 2000, land-owning farmers had large tracts of land and used economies of scale to raise capital, borrow money when necessary, and purchase modern mechanised farm equipment to increase productivity on their land. Because the primary beneficiaries of the land reform were members of the Government and their families, despite the fact that most had no experience in running a farm, the drop in total farm output has been tremendous and has even produced starvation and famine, according to aid agencies. Export crops have suffered tremendously in this period. Whereas Zimbabwe was the world&#x27;s sixth-largest producer of tobacco in 2001, in 2005 it produced less than a third the amount produced in 2000.

Zimbabwe was once so rich in agricultural produce that it was dubbed the &quot;bread basket&quot; of Southern Africa, while it is now struggling to feed its own population. About 45 percent of the population is now considered malnourished. Crops for export such as tobacco, coffee and tea have suffered the most under the land reform. Annual production of maize, the main everyday food for Zimbabweans, was reduced by 31% during 2002 to 2012, while annual small grains production was up 163% during the same period. With over a million hectares converted from primarily export crops to primarily maize, production of maize finally reached pre-2001 volume in 2017 under Mnangagwa&#x27;s &quot;command agriculture&quot; programme.

====Tobacco====

Land reform caused a collapse in Zimbabwe&#x27;s tobacco crop, its main agricultural export. In 2001, Zimbabwe was the world&#x27;s sixth-largest producer of tobacco, behind only China, Brazil, India, the United States and Indonesia. By 2008, tobacco production had collapsed to 48 million kg, just 21% of the amount grown in 2000 and smaller than the crop grown in 1950.

In 2005, the contract system was introduced into Zimbabwe. International tobacco companies contracted with small-scale subsistence farmers to buy their crop. In return, the farmers received agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertiliser, as well as advice and supervision. Production revived as the small-scale black farmers gained experience in growing tobacco. In 2019, Zimbabwe produced 258 million kg of tobacco, the second-largest crop on record. This increase in production came at the cost of quality as the capacity to produce higher-value cured high-nicotine tobacco was lost being largely replaced by lower-value filler-quality tobacco.

===Economic consequences===
Critics of the land reforms have contended that they have had a serious detrimental effect on the Zimbabwean economy.

The rebound in Zimbabwean GDP following dollarisation is attributable to loans and foreign aid obtained by pledging the country&#x27;s vast natural resources—including diamonds, gold, and platinum—to foreign powers.

In response to what was described as the &quot;fast-track land reform&quot; in Zimbabwe, the United States government put the Zimbabwean government on a credit freeze in 2001 through the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (specifically Section 4C titled Multilateral Financing Restriction),

Zimbabwe&#x27;s trade surplus was $322 million in 2001, in 2002 trade deficit was $18 million, to grow rapidly in subsequent years.

<text>GNU Go is a free software program by the Free Software Foundation that plays Go. Its source code is quite portable, and can be easily compiled for Linux, as well as other Unix-like systems, Microsoft Windows and macOS; ports exist for other platforms.

The program plays Go against the user, at about 5 to 7 kyu strength on the 9×9 board. Multiple board sizes are supported, from 5×5 to 19×19.

== Strength ==
At this level of performance, GnuGo was between six and seven stones weaker than the top commercial programs on good hardware as of early 2009, but comparable in strength to the strongest programs not using Monte Carlo methods. It did well at many computer Go tournaments. For instance, it took the gold medal at the 2003 and 2006 Computer Olympiad and second place at the 2006 Gifu Challenge.

== Protocols ==
Although ASCII-based, GNU Go supports two protocols—the Go Modem Protocol and the Go Text Protocol—by which GUIs can interface with it to give a graphical display. Several such GUIs exist. GTP also allows it to play online on Go servers (through the use of bridge programs), and copies can be found running on NNGS, KGS, and probably others.

== Versions ==
The current (stable) version of GNU Go is 3.8. The latest experimental release was 3.9.1. There is also an experimental feature for using Monte Carlo methods for 9×9 board play.

A version called Pocket GNU Go, based on GNU Go 2.6, is available for the Windows CE operating system (Pocket PC). Versions based on the much weaker 1.2 engine also exist for the Game Boy Advance and Palm Pilot.

<doc id="341598" wikidata="Q29137" url="?curid=341598" title="Cybercrime">
<text>Cybercrime encompasses a wide range of criminal activities that are carried out using digital devices and/or networks. These crimes involve the use of technology to commit fraud, identity theft, data breaches, computer viruses, scams, and expanded upon in other malicious acts. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, disrupt services, and cause financial or reputational harm to individuals, organizations, and governments.

In 2000, the tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders classified cyber crimes into five categories: unauthorized access, damage to computer data or programs, sabotage to hinder the functioning of a computer system or network, unauthorized interception of data within a system or network, and computer espionage.

Internationally, both state and non-state actors engage in cybercrimes, including espionage, financial theft, and other cross-border crimes. Cybercrimes crossing international borders and involving the actions of at least one nation-state are sometimes referred to as cyberwarfare. Warren Buffett has described that cybercrime is the &quot;number one problem with mankind&quot;, and that it &quot;poses real risks to humanity&quot;.

The World Economic Forum&#x27;s (WEF) 2020 Global Risks Report highlighted that organized cybercrime groups are joining forces to commit criminal activities online, while estimating the likelihood of their detection and prosecution to be less than 1 percent in the US. There are also many privacy concerns surrounding cybercrime when confidential information is intercepted or disclosed, legally or otherwise.

The World Economic Forum’s 2023 Global Risks Report ranked cybercrime as one of the top 10 risks facing the world today and for the next 10 years. If viewed as a nation state, cybercrime would count as the third largest economy in the world. In numbers, cybercrime is predicted to cause over 9 trillion US dollars in damages worldwide in 2024.  

== Classifications ==
Computer crime encompasses a broad range of activities, including computer fraud, financial crimes, scams, cybersex trafficking, and ad-fraud.

=== Computer fraud ===

Computer fraud is the act of using a computer to take or alter electronic data, or to gain unlawful use of a computer or system. Computer fraud that involves the use of the internet is also called internet fraud. The legal definition of computer fraud varies by jurisdiction, but typically involves accessing a computer without permission or authorization.

Forms of computer fraud include hacking into computers to alter information, distributing malicious code such as computer worms or viruses, installing malware or spyware to steal data, phishing, and advance-fee scams.

Other forms of fraud may be committed using computer systems, including bank fraud, carding, identity theft, extortion, and theft of classified information. These types of crimes often result in the loss of personal or financial information.

===Digital arrest===

Digital arrest is a form of online fraud where perpetrators impersonate law enforcement officials to deceive victims. This scam typically involves contacting individuals via phone, falsely claiming they are implicated in criminal activity related to a parcel containing illegal goods, drugs, counterfeit documents, or other contraband. In some variations, scammers target the victim&#x27;s relatives or friends, falsely stating the victim is in custody due to criminal involvement or an accident. Victims are then coerced into remaining on camera and isolating themselves, while the fraudsters extract personal and financial information under the guise of an official investigation, ultimately transferring the victim&#x27;s assets to money mule accounts. 

To detect and prevent the fraud, be wary of unsolicited calls from supposed law enforcement demanding immediate payment or personal information. Legitimate law enforcement agencies rarely conduct investigations in this manner. Verify the identity of the caller independently by contacting the relevant agency directly through official channels. Remember, the government agencies never put anyone under digital arrest, it&#x27;s not permissible.

===Fraud Factory===

Fraud factory is a collection of large fraud organizations usually involving cyber fraud and human trafficking operations.

===Cyberterrorism===

The term &quot;cyberterrorism&quot; refers to acts of terrorism committed through the use of cyberspace or computer resources. Acts of disruption of computer networks and personal computers through viruses, worms, phishing, malicious software, hardware, or programming scripts can all be forms of cyberterrorism.

Government officials and information technology (IT) security specialists have documented a significant increase in network problems and server scams since early 2001. In the United States there is an increasing concern from agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

===Cyberextortion===
Cyberextortion occurs when a website, e-mail server, or computer system is subjected to or threatened with attacks by malicious hackers, often through denial-of-service attacks. Cyber extortionists demand money in return for promising to stop the attacks and provide &quot;protection&quot;. According to the FBI, cyber extortionists are increasingly attacking corporate websites and networks, crippling their ability to operate, and demanding payments to restore their service. More than 20 cases are reported each month to the FBI, and many go unreported in order to keep the victim&#x27;s name out of the public domain. Perpetrators often use a distributed denial-of-service attack. However, other cyberextortion techniques exist, such as doxing and bug poaching. An example of cyberextortion was the Sony Hack of 2014.

=== Ransomware ===

Ransomware is a type of malware used in cyberextortion to restrict access to files, sometimes threatening permanent data erasure unless a ransom is paid. Ransomware is a global issue, with more than 300 million attacks worldwide in 2021. According to the 2022 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report, in 2021 the average ransom demand in cases handled by Norton climbed 144 percent to $2.2 million, and there was an 85 percent increase in the number of victims who had their personal information shown on dark web information dumps. A loss of nearly $400 million in 2021 and 2022 is just one of the statistics showing the impact of ransomware attacks on everyday people.

===Cybersex trafficking===

Cybersex trafficking is the transportation of victims for such purposes as coerced prostitution or the live streaming of coerced sexual acts or rape on webcam. Victims are abducted, threatened, or deceived and transferred to &quot;cybersex dens&quot;. The dens can be in any location where the cybersex traffickers have a computer, tablet, or phone with an internet connection. Perpetrators use social media networks, video conferences, dating pages, online chat rooms, apps, dark web sites, and other platforms. They use online payment systems and cryptocurrencies to hide their identities. Millions of reports of cybersex incidents are sent to authorities annually. New legislation and police procedures are needed to combat this type of cybercrime.

There are an estimated 6.3 million victims of cybersex trafficking, according to a recent report by the International Labour Organization. This number includes about 1.7 million child victims. An example of cybersex trafficking is the 2018–2020 Nth room case in South Korea.

===Cyberwarfare===

According to the U.S. Department of Defense, cyberspace has emerged as an arena for national-security threats through several recent events of geostrategic importance, including the attack on Estonia&#x27;s infrastructure in 2007, allegedly by Russian hackers. In August 2008, Russia again allegedly conducted cyberattacks against Georgia. Fearing that such attacks may become a normal part of future warfare among nation-states, military commanders see a need to develop cyberspace operations.

===Computers as a tool===

When an individual is the target of cybercrime, the computer is often the tool rather than the target. These crimes, which typically exploit human weaknesses, usually do not require much technical expertise. These are the types of crimes which have existed for centuries in the offline world. Criminals have simply been given a tool that increases their pool of potential victims and makes them all the harder to trace and apprehend.

Crimes that use computer networks or devices to advance other ends include:
*Fraud and identity theft (although this increasingly uses malware, hacking or phishing, making it an example of &quot;computer as target&quot; as well as &quot;computer as tool&quot;)
*Information warfare
*Phishing scams
*Spam
*Propagation of illegal, obscene, or offensive content, including harassment and threats

The unsolicited sending of bulk email for commercial purposes (spam) is unlawful in some jurisdictions.

Phishing is mostly propagated via email. Phishing emails may contain links to other websites that are affected by malware. Or they may contain links to fake online banking or other websites used to steal private account information.

===Obscene or offensive content===
The content of websites and other electronic communications may be distasteful, obscene, or offensive for a variety of reasons. In some instances, it may be illegal. What content is unlawful varies greatly between countries, and even within nations. It is a sensitive area in which the courts can become involved in arbitrating between groups with strong beliefs.

One area of internet pornography that has been the target of the strongest efforts at curtailment is child pornography, which is illegal in most jurisdictions in the world.

===Ad-fraud===
Ad-frauds are particularly popular among cybercriminals, as such frauds are lucrative and unlikely to be prosecuted. Jean-Loup Richet, a professor at the Sorbonne Business School, classified the large variety of ad-frauds committed by cybercriminals into three categories: identity fraud, attribution fraud, and ad-fraud services.

Identity fraud aims to impersonate real users and inflate audience numbers. The techniques used for identity fraud include traffic from bots (coming from a hosting company, a data center, or compromised devices); cookie stuffing; falsification of user characteristics, such as location and browser type; fake social traffic (misleading users on social networks into visiting the advertised website); and fake social media accounts that make a bot appear legitimate.

Attribution fraud impersonates the activities of real users, such as clicks and conversations. Many ad-fraud techniques belong to this category: the use of hijacked and malware-infected devices as part of a botnet; click farms (companies where low-wage employees are paid to click or engage in conversations); incentivized browsing; video placement abuse (delivered in display banner slots); hidden ads (which will never be viewed by real users); domain spoofing (ads served on a fake website); and clickjacking, in which the user is forced to click on an ad.

Ad-fraud services include all online infrastructure and hosting services that might be needed to undertake identity or attribution fraud. Services can involve the creation of spam websites (fake networks of websites that provide artificial backlinks); link building services; hosting services; or fake and scam pages impersonating a famous brand.

===Online harassment===

Whereas content may be offensive in a non-specific way, harassment directs obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals, often focusing on gender, race, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation.

Committing a crime using a computer can lead to an enhanced sentence. For example, in the case of &quot;United States v. Neil Scott Kramer&quot;, the defendant was given an enhanced sentence according to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §2G1.3(b)(3) for his use of a cell phone to &quot;persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.&quot; Kramer appealed the sentence on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to convict him under this statute because his charge included persuading through a computer device and his cellular phone technically is not a computer. Although Kramer tried to argue this point, the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual states that the term &quot;computer&quot; means &quot;an electronic, magnetic, optical, electrochemical, or other high-speed data processing device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device.&quot;

In the United States, at least 41 states have passed laws and regulations that regard extreme online harassment as a criminal act. These acts can also be prosecuted on the federal level, because of US Code 18 Section 2261A, which states that using computers to threaten or harass can lead to a sentence of up to 20 years.

Several countries besides the US have also created laws to combat online harassment. In China, a country with over 20 percent of the world&#x27;s internet users, in response to the Human Flesh Search Engine bullying incident, the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council passed a strict law against cyberbullying. The United Kingdom passed the Malicious Communications Act, which states that sending messages or letters electronically that the government deems &quot;indecent or grossly offensive&quot; and/or language intended to cause &quot;distress and anxiety&quot; can lead to a prison sentence of six months and a potentially large fine.  Australia, while not directly addressing the issue of harassment, includes most forms of online harassment under the Criminal Code Act of 1995. Using telecommunication to send threats, harass, or cause offense is a direct violation of this act.

Although freedom of speech is protected by law in most democratic societies, it does not include all types of speech. Spoken or written threats can be criminalized because they harm or intimidate. This applies to online or network-related threats.

Cyberbullying has increased drastically with the growing popularity of online social networking. As of January 2020, 44 percent of adult internet users in the United States had &quot;personally experienced online harassment&quot;. Online harassment of children often has negative and even life-threatening effects. According to a 2021 survey, 41 percent of children develop social anxiety, 37 percent develop depression, and 26 percent have suicidal thoughts.

The United Arab Emirates was found to have purchased the NSO Group&#x27;s mobile spyware Pegasus for mass surveillance and a campaign of harassment of prominent activists and journalists, including Ahmed Mansoor, Princess Latifa, Princess Haya, and others. Ghada Owais was one of the many high-profile female journalists and activists who were targeted. She filed a lawsuit against UAE ruler Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan along with other defendants, accusing them of sharing her photos online.

===Drug trafficking===
Darknet markets are used to buy and sell recreational drugs online. Some drug traffickers use encrypted messaging tools to communicate with drug mules or potential customers. The dark web site Silk Road, which started operations in 2011, was the first major online marketplace for drugs. It was permanently shut down in October 2013 by the FBI and Europol. After Silk Road 2.0 went down, Silk Road 3 Reloaded emerged. However, it was just an older marketplace named Diabolus Market that used the Silk Road name in order to get more exposure from the Silk Road brand&#x27;s earlier success.

Darknet markets have had a rise in traffic in recent years for many reasons, such as the anonymous purchases and often a system of reviews by other buyers. There are many ways in which darknet markets can financially drain individuals. Vendors and customers alike go to great lengths to keep their identities a secret while online. Commonly used tools for hiding their online presence include virtual private networks (VPNs), Tails, and the Tor Browser. Darknet markets entice customers by making them feel comfortable. Although people can easily gain access to a Tor browser, actually gaining access to an illicit market is not as simple as typing it in on a search engine, as one would with Google. Darknet markets have special links that change frequently, ending in .onion as opposed to the typical .com, .net, and .org domain extensions. To add to privacy, the most prevalent currency on these markets is Bitcoin, which allows transactions to be anonymous.

A problem that marketplace users sometimes face is exit scamming. That is, a vendor with a high rating acts as if they are selling on the market and have users pay for products they never receive. The vendor then closes their account after receiving money from multiple buyers and never sending what was paid for. The vendors, all of whom are involved in illegal activities, have no reason not to engage in exit scamming when they no longer want to be a vendor. In 2019, an entire market known as Wall Street Market allegedly exit scammed, stealing $30 million dollars in bitcoin.

The FBI has cracked down on these markets. In July 2017, the FBI seized one of the biggest markets, commonly called Alphabay, which re-opened in August 2021 under the control of DeSnake, one of the original administrators. Investigators pose as buyers and order products from darknet vendors in the hope that the vendors leave a trail the investigators can follow. In one case an investigator posed as a firearms seller, and for six months people purchased from them and provided home addresses. The FBI was able to make over a dozen arrests during this six-month investigation. Another crackdown targeted vendors selling fentanyl and opiates. With thousands of people dying each year due to drug overdose, investigators have made internet drug sales a priority. Many vendors do not realize the extra criminal charges that go along with selling drugs online, such as money laundering and illegal use of the mail. In 2019, a vendor was sentenced to 10 years in prison after selling cocaine and methamphetamine under the name JetSetLife. But despite the large amount of time investigators spend tracking down people, in 2018 only 65 suspects who bought and sold illegal goods on some of the biggest markets were identified. Meanwhile, thousands of transactions take place daily on these markets.

==Notable incidents==
* One of the highest-profile banking computer crimes occurred over a course of three years beginning in 1970. The chief teller at the Park Avenue branch of New York&#x27;s Union Dime Savings Bank embezzled over $1.5 million from hundreds of accounts. 
* In 2014, the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack not only exposed sensitive company data but also led to extortion demands, marking one of the most publicized corporate cyberattacks to date.
* A hacking group called MOD (Masters of Deception) allegedly stole passwords and technical data from Pacific Bell, Nynex, and other telephone companies as well as several big credit agencies and two major universities. The damage caused was extensive; one company, Southwestern Bell, suffered losses of $370,000.
* In 1983, a 19-year-old UCLA student used his PC to break into a Defense Department International Communications system.
* Between 1995 and 1998 the Newscorp satellite pay-to-view encrypted SKY-TV service was hacked several times during an ongoing technological arms race between a pan-European hacking group and Newscorp. The original motivation of the hackers was to watch &quot;Star Trek&quot; reruns in Germany, which was something which Newscorp did not have the copyright permission to allow.
* On 26 March 1999, the Melissa worm infected a document on a victim&#x27;s computer, then automatically emailed that document and a copy of the virus to other people.
* In February 2000, an individual going by the alias of MafiaBoy began a series of denial-of-service attacks against high-profile websites, including Yahoo!, Dell, Inc., E*TRADE, eBay, and CNN. About 50 computers at Stanford University, along with computers at the University of California at Santa Barbara, were among the zombie computers sending pings in the distributed denial-of-service attacks. On 3 August 2000, Canadian federal prosecutors charged MafiaBoy with 54 counts of illegal access to computers.
* The Stuxnet worm corrupted SCADA microprocessors, particularly the types used in Siemens centrifuge controllers.
* The Russian Business Network (RBN) was registered as an internet site in 2006. Initially, much of its activity was legitimate. But apparently the founders soon discovered that it was more profitable to host illegitimate activities and to offer its services to criminals. The RBN has been described by VeriSign as &quot;the baddest of the bad&quot;. It provides web hosting services and internet access to all kinds of criminal and objectionable activities that earn up to $150 million in one year. It specializes in personal identity theft for resale. It is the originator of MPack and an alleged operator of the now defunct Storm botnet.
* On 2 March 2010, Spanish investigators arrested three men suspected of infecting over 13 million computers around the world. The botnet of infected computers included PCs inside more than half of the Fortune 1000 companies and more than 40 major banks, according to investigators.
* In August 2010, the US Department of Homeland Security shut down the international pedophile ring Dreamboard. The website had approximately 600 members and may have distributed up to 123 terabytes of child pornography (roughly equivalent to 16,000 DVDs). To date this is the single largest US prosecution of an international child pornography ring; 52 arrests were made worldwide.
* In January 2012, Zappos.com experienced a security breach compromising the credit card numbers, personal information, and billing and shipping addresses of as many as 24 million customers.
* In June 2012, LinkedIn and eHarmony were attacked, and 65 million password hashes were compromised. Thirty thousand passwords were cracked, and 1.5 million eHarmony passwords were posted online.
* In December 2012, the Wells Fargo website experienced a denial-of-service attack that potentially compromised 70 million customers and 8.5 million active viewers. Other banks thought to be compromised included Bank of America, J. P. Morgan, U.S. Bank, and PNC Financial Services.
* On 23 April 2013, the Twitter account of the Associated Press was hacked. The hacker posted a hoax tweet about fictitious attacks on the White House that they claimed left then-President Obama injured. The hoax tweet resulted in a brief plunge of 130 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the removal of $136 billion from the S&amp;P 500 index, and the temporary suspension of AP&#x27;s Twitter account. The Dow Jones later restored its session gains.
*In May 2017, 74 countries logged a ransomware cybercrime called &quot;WannaCry&quot;.
* Illicit access to camera sensors, microphone sensors, phonebook contacts, all internet-enabled apps, and metadata of mobile telephones running Android and iOS was reportedly provided by Israeli spyware that was found to be in operation in at least 46 nation-states around the world. Journalists, royalty, and government officials were among the targets. Earlier accusations that Israeli weapons companies were meddling in international telephony and smartphones have been eclipsed by the 2018 Pegasus spyware revelations.
*In December 2019, US intelligence officials and &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed that ToTok, a messaging application widely used in the United Arab Emirates, is a spying tool for the UAE. An investigation revealed that the Emirati government was attempting to track every conversation, movement, relationship, appointment, sound, and image of those who installed the app on their phones.
*On February 5, 2025, &quot;La Razon&quot; reported the arrest of a young man known as &#x27;Natohub&#x27; who is suspected of hacking and selling information from Spanish government computer systems, NATO, United Nations, U.S. Army and other international computer systems from his home in Alicante, Spain.

==Combating computer crime==
Due to cybercriminals using the internet for cross-border attacks and crimes, the process of prosecuting cybercriminals has been difficult. The number of vulnerabilities that a cybercriminal could use as points of opportunity to exploit has also increased over the years. From 2008 to 2014 alone, there has been a 17.75% increase in vulnerabilities across all online devices. The internet&#x27;s expansive reach causes the damage inflicted to people to be magnified since many methods of cybercrime have the opportunity to reach many people. The availability of virtual spaces has allowed cybercrime to become an everyday occurrence. In 2018, the Internet Crime Complaint Center received 351,937 complaints of cybercrime, which led to $2.7 billion lost.

===Investigation===
In a criminal investigation, a computer can be a source of evidence (see digital forensics). Even when a computer is not directly used for criminal purposes, it may contain records of value to criminal investigators in the form of a logfile. In many countries, Internet Service Providers are required by law to keep their logfiles for a predetermined amount of time.

There are many ways for cybercrime to take place, and investigations tend to start with an IP Address trace; however, that does not necessarily enable detectives to solve a case. Different types of high-tech crime may also include elements of low-tech crime, and vice versa, making cybercrime investigators an indispensable part of modern law enforcement. Methods of cybercrime detective work are dynamic and constantly improving, whether in closed police units or in the framework of international cooperation.

In the United States, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are government agencies that combat cybercrime. The FBI has trained agents and analysts in cybercrime placed in their field offices and headquarters. In the DHS, the Secret Service has a Cyber Intelligence Section that works to target financial cybercrimes. They combat international cybercrime and work to protect institutions such as banks from intrusions and information breaches. Based in Alabama, the Secret Service and the Alabama Office of Prosecution Services work together to train professionals in law enforcement at the National Computer Forensic Institute. The NCFI provides &quot;state and local members of the law enforcement community with training in cyber incident response, investigation, and forensic examination in cyber incident response, investigation, and forensic examination.&quot;

Investigating cyber crime within the United States and globally often requires partnerships. Within the United States, cyber crime may be investigated by law enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security, among other federal agencies. However, as the world becomes more dependent on technology, cyber attacks and cyber crime are going to expand as threat actors will continue to exploit weaknesses in protection and existing vulnerabilities to achieve their end goals, often being data theft or exfiltration. To combat cybercrime, the United States Secret Service maintains an Electronic Crimes Task Force which extends beyond the United States as it helps to locate threat actors that are located globally and performing cyber related crimes within the United States. The Secret Service is also responsible for the National Computer Forensic Institute which allows law enforcement and people of the court to receive cyber training and information on how to combat cyber crime. The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement is responsible for the Cyber Crimes Center (C3) providing cyber crime related services for federal, state, local and international agencies. Finally, the United States also has resources relating to Law Enforcement Cyber Incident Reporting to allow local and state agencies to understand how, when, and what should be reported as a cyber incident to the federal government.

Because cybercriminals commonly use encryption and other techniques to hide their identity and location, it can be difficult to trace a perpetrator after a crime is committed, so prevention measures are crucial.

=== Prevention ===
The Department of Homeland Security also instituted the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Program. The CDM Program monitors and secures government networks by tracking network risks and informing system personnel so that they can take action. In an attempt to catch intrusions before the damage is done, the DHS created the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS). The Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency approves the private partners that provide intrusion detection and prevention services through the ECS.

Cybersecurity professionals have been skeptical of prevention-focused strategies. The mode of use of cybersecurity products has also been called into question. Shuman Ghosemajumder has argued that individual companies using a combination of products for security is not a scalable approach and has advocated for the use of cybersecurity technology primarily at the platform level.

On a personal level, there are some strategies available to defend against cybercrime:

* Keeping your software and operating system update to benefit from security patches
* Using anti-virus software that can detect and remove malicious threats
* Use strong passwords with a variety of characters that aren&#x27;t easy to guess
* Refrain from opening attachments from spam emails
* Do not click on links from scam emails
* Do not give out personal information over the internet unless you can verify that the destination is safe
* Contact companies about suspicious requests of your information

===Legislation===
Because of weak laws, cybercriminals operating from developing countries can often evade detection and prosecution. In countries such as the Philippines, laws against cybercrime are weak or sometimes nonexistent. Cybercriminals can then strike from across international borders and remain undetected. Even when identified, these criminals can typically avoid being extradited to a country such as the US that has laws that allow for prosecution. For this reason, agencies such as the FBI have used deception and subterfuge to catch criminals. For example, two Russian hackers had been evading the FBI for some time. The FBI set up a fake computing company based in Seattle, Washington. They proceeded to lure the two Russian men into the United States by offering them work with this company. Upon completion of the interview, the suspects were arrested. Clever tricks like that are sometimes a necessary part of catching cybercriminals when weak laws and limited international cooperation make it impossible otherwise.

The first cyber related law in the United States was the Privacy Act of 1974 which was only required for federal agencies to follow to ensure privacy and protection of personally identifiable information (PII). However, since 1974, in the United States other laws and regulations have been drafted and implemented, but there is still a gap in responding to current cyber related crime. The most recent cyber related law, according to NIST, was the NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act, which came out in 2018, and provides guidelines to small businesses to ensure that cybersecurity risks are being identified and addressed accurately.

During President Barack Obama&#x27;s presidency three cybersecurity related bills were signed into order in December 2014. The first was the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, the second was the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014, and the third was the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014. Although the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 was just an update of an older version of the act, it focused on the practices federal agencies were to abide by relating to cybersecurity. While the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 was aimed toward increasing the amount of information sharing that occurs across the federal and private sector to improve cybersecurity amongst the industries. Finally, the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 relates to cybersecurity research and education.

In April 2015, then-President Barack Obama released an executive order that allows the US to freeze the assets of convicted cybercriminals and block their economic activity within the United States.

The European Union adopted cybercrime directive 2013/40/EU, which was elaborated upon in the Council of Europe&#x27;s Convention on Cybercrime.

It is not only the US and the European Union that have been introducing measures against cybercrime. On 31 May 2017, China announced that its new cybersecurity law was taking effect.

In Australia, legislation to combat cybercrime includes the Criminal Code Act 1995, the Telecommunications Act 1997, and the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015.

===Penalties===
Penalties for computer-related crimes in New York State can range from a fine and a short period of jail time for a Class A misdemeanor, such as unauthorized use of a computer, up to 3 to 15 years in prison for a Class C felony, such as computer tampering in the first degree.

However, some former cybercriminals have been hired as information security experts by private companies due to their inside knowledge of computer crime, a phenomenon which theoretically could create perverse incentives. A possible counter to this is for courts to ban convicted hackers from using the internet or computers, even after they have been released from prisonthough as computers and the internet become more and more central to everyday life, this type of punishment becomes more and more draconian. Nuanced approaches have been developed that manage cyber offenders&#x27; behavior without resorting to total computer or internet bans. These approaches involve restricting individuals to specific devices which are subject to monitoring or searches by probation or parole officers.

=== Awareness ===
Cybercrime is becoming more of a threat in our society. According to Accenture&#x27;s State of Cybersecurity, security attacks increased 31% from 2020 to 2021. The number of attacks per company increased from 206 to 270. Due to this rising threat, the importance of raising awareness about measures to protect information and the tactics criminals use to steal that information is paramount. However, despite cybercrime becoming a mounting problem, many people are not aware of the severity of this problem. This could be attributed to a lack of experience and knowledge of technological issues. There are 1.5 million cyber-attacks annually, which means that there are over 4,000 attacks a day, 170 attacks every hour, or nearly three attacks every minute, with studies showing that only 16 percent of victims had asked the people who were carrying out the attacks to stop. Comparitech&#x27;s 2023 study shows that cybercrime victims have peaked to 71 million annually, which means there is a cyberattack every 39 seconds. Anybody who uses the internet for any reason can be a victim, which is why it is important to be aware of how to be protected while online.

=== Intelligence ===
As cybercrime proliferated, a professional ecosystem evolved to support individuals and groups seeking to profit from cybercrime activities. The ecosystem has become quite specialized, and includes malware developers, botnet operators, professional cybercrime groups, groups specializing in the sale of stolen content, and so forth. A few of the leading cybersecurity companies have the skills and resources to follow the activities of these individuals and groups. A wide variety of information that can be used for defensive purposes is available from these sources, for example, technical indicators such as hashes of infected files and malicious IPs/URLs, as well as strategic information profiling the goals and techniques of the profiled groups. Much of it is freely available, but consistent, ongoing access typically requires a subscription. Some in the corporate sector see a crucial role for artificial intelligence in the future development of cybersecurity.

Interpol&#x27;s Cyber Fusion Center began a collaboration with key cybersecurity players to distribute information on the latest online scams, cyber threats, and risks to internet users. Since 2017, reports on social engineering frauds, ransomware, phishing, and other attacks have been distributed to security agencies in over 150 countries.

===Spread of cybercrime===
The increasing prevalence of cybercrime has resulted in more attention to computer crime detection and prosecution.

Hacking has become less complex as hacking communities disseminate their knowledge through the internet. Blogs and social networks have contributed substantially to information sharing, so that beginners can benefit from older hackers&#x27; knowledge and advice.

Furthermore, hacking is cheaper than ever. Before the cloud computing era, in order to spam or scam, one needed a variety of resources, such as a dedicated server; skills in server management, network configuration, and network maintenance; and knowledge of internet service provider standards. By comparison, a software-as-a-service for mail is a scalable and inexpensive bulk e-mail-sending service for marketing purposes that could be easily set up for spam. Cloud computing could help cybercriminals leverage their attacks, whether brute-forcing a password, improving the reach of a botnet, or facilitating a spamming campaign.

<text>Patrick Dalzel-Job (1 June 1913 – 14 October 2003) was a British naval intelligence officer and commando in World War II. He was also an accomplished linguist, author, mariner, navigator, parachutist, diver, and skier.

Dalzel-Job is widely thought to be the model for James Bond, Ian Fleming&#x27;s fictional spy, 007.

==Early life==
Born in London, Dalzel-Job was the only son of Captain Ernest Dalzel-Job, who was killed in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. After his father&#x27;s death Dalzel-Job and his mother lived in various locations, including Switzerland, and he learnt to ski and sail. They returned to the UK in 1931 where he built his own schooner, the &quot;Mary Fortune&quot;, which he and his mother spent the next two years sailing around the British coast.

In 1937, they sailed to Norway and spent the next two years exploring the coast. During this time Dalzel-Job became fluent in Norwegian. He and his mother took on as crew a Norwegian schoolgirl named Bjørg Bangsund from the city of Tromsø.

==WWII==
On 8 December 1939, Dalzel-Job was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He served as navigating officer on a fleet tug operating from Scapa Flow between January and March 1940. From April to June, he served with the Anglo–Polish–French Expeditionary Force to Norway. He disobeyed a direct order to cease civilian evacuations from Narvik. His action saved some 5,000 Norwegians for which King Haakon of Norway awarded him the &quot;Ridderkors&quot; (Knight&#x27;s Cross) of St. Olav in 1943. This award saved him from being court-martialled.

In June 1942, Dalzel-Job was assigned to collate information about the west coast of Norway. A few months later, Lord Louis Mountbatten, head of Combined Operations, chose him to convey commando raids there, known as &quot;Operation VP&quot;, using eight Fairmile D motor torpedo boats.

From mid-1943 until early-1944, he served with the 12 (Special Service) Submarine Flotilla, being trained on X-Craft and &quot;Welman&quot; midget submarines, while taking time to complete parachute training with the Airborne Division. As prospects for major action in Norway faded, Dalzel-Job visited London and discovered 30 AU (Assault Unit) Commando, the field operative unit of the Naval Intelligence Division—Room 30. He transferred to 30 AU under Commander Ian Fleming who was then personal assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence. In this role and promoted to lieutenant commander, he landed near Saint-Martin-de-Varreville on Utah Beach, Normandy, on D+4 with two Royal Marine Commandos allocated to him and an unrestricted authority order signed by U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower to pass through Allied lines and assault specific targets in German-held territory. He subsequently assisted in disabling the at Bremerhaven with full crew and taking surrender of the town of Bremen.

==Postwar==
Immediately following the war, Dalzel-Job returned to England on 24 May 1945 and petitioned the Admiralty to be sent to Norway. His intent was to find Bjørg Bangsund, who had sailed with him six years earlier. In 1945 she was 19, he was 32. They wed in Oslo three weeks after he found her at Vestbane train station in Oslo. After their marriage on 26 June 1945 they returned to Edinburgh.

For a time the newly married couple lived at Onich, near Fort William, where their only child, Iain, was born. Later, the family moved to Canada, where Dalzel-Job served with the Royal Canadian Navy, and where their home was a log cabin in northern British Columbia.
Returning to Scotland in 1960, they lived in Lochalsh, at Nead-An-Eoin on the shore of Outer Loch Carron. He briefly taught maths, English, and chemistry. Dalzel-Job&#x27;s wife, Bjørg, died in 1986.

Their son, Iain Dalzel-Job, was to serve as a major in the 2nd Battalion, The Scots Guards and commanded G Company (7, 8, and 9 Platoons) in the assault on Mount Tumbledown during the Falklands War.

Dalzel-Job later acknowledged that Fleming had told him he was the basis for Bond, but added, &quot;I have never read a Bond book or seen a Bond movie. They are not my style... And I only ever loved one woman [Bjørg], and I&#x27;m not a drinking man.&quot; &quot;I prefer the quiet life now,&quot; Dalzel-Job went on. &quot;When you have led such an exciting life you don&#x27;t need to see a fictional account of it.&quot;

He released his memoirs, titled &quot;From Arctic Snow to Dust of Normandy&quot; () in 1991. It was later republished as &quot;Arctic Snow to Dust of Normandy&quot;.

<doc id="341605" wikidata="Q2421" url="?curid=341605" title="River Forth">
<text>The River Forth is a major river in central Scotland, long, which drains into the North Sea on the east coast of the country. Its drainage basin covers much of Stirlingshire in Scotland&#x27;s Central Belt. The Gaelic name for the upper reach of the river, above Stirling, is &quot;Abhainn Dubh&quot;, meaning &quot;black river&quot;. The name for the river below the tidal reach (just past where it is crossed by the M9 motorway) is &quot;Uisge For&quot;.

==Name==
&quot;Forth&quot; derives from Proto-Celtic &quot;*Vo-rit-ia&quot; (slow running), yielding &quot;Foirthe&quot; in Old Gaelic.

==Course==

The Forth rises in the Trossachs, a mountainous area west of Stirling. Ben Lomond&#x27;s eastern slopes drain into the Duchray Water, which meets with Avondhu River coming from Loch Ard. The confluence of these two streams is the nominal start of the River Forth. From there it flows roughly eastward through Aberfoyle, joining with the Kelty Water about 5 km further downstream. It then flows into the flat expanse of the Carse of Stirling, including Flanders Moss. Just west of the M9, it is joined by the River Teith (which itself drains Loch Venachar, Loch Lubnaig, Loch Achray, Loch Katrine, and Loch Voil). The next tributary is the Allan Water, just east of the M9. From there the Forth meanders into the ancient port of Stirling. At Stirling the river widens and becomes tidal. This is the location of the last (seasonal) ford of the river. From Stirling, the Forth flows east, accepting the Bannock Burn from the south before passing the town of Fallin. It then passes two towns in Clackmannanshire: firstly Cambus (where it is joined by the River Devon), closely followed by Alloa. Upon reaching Airth (on the river&#x27;s south shore) and Kincardine (on its north shore), the river begins to widen and becomes the Firth of Forth.

== Settlements on the river ==

The banks have many settlements along them, including Aberfoyle, Gargunnock, Stirling, Fallin, Cambus, Throsk, Alloa, South Alloa, Dunmore, Airth, and Kincardine. Beyond these settlements, the water turns brackish, and is usually considered part of the Firth of Forth.

== Port activities ==

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Stirling harbour was a busy port, with goods coming into Scotland and being exported to Europe. As a result, Stirling had very close ties with the Hansa towns, with Bruges in Belgium, and with Veere (known at the time as Campvere) in the Netherlands. After 1707, trade with America became the new focus, and so a lot of trade activity shifted from Stirling in the east to the port of Glasgow in the west. During World Wars I and II, Stirling harbour began thriving again: It became a gateway for importing supplies of tea into Scotland. After the wars, other trade activities slowly returned, but growth was slow because the harbour&#x27;s owners levied heavy shore duties on shipping, making it less economically attractive to the few agricultural merchants who were based at Stirling. Today, Stirling&#x27;s harbour has fallen into disuse, but there are plans to redevelop it.

== Bridges ==
Upstream from Stirling, the river is rather narrow and can be crossed in numerous places. (Crossing used to be more difficult before the installation of modern drainage works, because the ground was often treacherously marshy near the riverbank.) However, after its confluence with the Teith and Allan, the river becomes wide enough that a substantial bridge is required. At Stirling, there has been a bridge over the river since at least the 13th century, and it was the easternmost road crossing until 1936, when another road crossing was opened at Kincardine. The Clackmannanshire Bridge, just upstream of the Kincardine Bridge, opened on 19 November 2008. A railway bridge, the Alloa Swing Bridge, previously connected Alloa on the northern shore with Throsk on the southern shore. It opened in 1885 and was closed and mostly demolished in 1970: Only the metal piers remain.

Much further downstream, joining North Queensferry and South Queensferry, is another railway bridge, the famous Forth Bridge, which opened in 1890, and the Forth Road Bridge, which opened in 1964. To the west of the Forth Road Bridge is Queensferry Crossing, construction of which began in 2011: It finally opened on 4 September 2017.

=== List of bridges ===
There are a total of 24 bridges crossing the River Forth:

*Manse Road Bridge

<doc id="341606" wikidata="Q333072" url="?curid=341606" title="Richard Cobden">
<text>Richard Cobden (3 June 1804 – 2 April 1865) was an English Radical and Liberal politician, manufacturer, and a campaigner for free trade and peace. He was associated with the Anti-Corn Law League and the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty.

As a young man, Cobden was a successful commercial traveller who became co-owner of a highly profitable calico printing factory in Sabden but lived in Manchester, a city with which he would become strongly identified. However, he soon found himself more engaged in politics, and his travels convinced him of the virtues of free trade (anti-protection) as the key to better international relations.

In 1838, he and John Bright founded the Anti-Corn Law League, aimed at abolishing the unpopular Corn Laws, which protected landowners&#x27; interests by levying taxes on imported wheat, thus raising the price of bread. As a Member of Parliament from 1841, he fought against opposition from the Peel ministry, and abolition was achieved in 1846.

Another free trade initiative was the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty of 1860, promoting closer interdependence between Britain and France. This campaign was conducted in collaboration with John Bright and French economist Michel Chevalier, and succeeded despite Parliament&#x27;s endemic mistrust of the French.

==Life==
===Early years===
Cobden was born at a farmhouse called Dunford, in Heyshott near Midhurst, in Sussex. He was the fourth of 11 children born to Millicent ( Amber) and William Cobden. His family had been resident in that neighbourhood for many generations, occupied in trade and agriculture. His grandfather, Richard Cobden, owned Bex Mill in Heyshott and was a prosperous maltster who served as bailiff and chief magistrate at Midhurst. His father William however forsook malting in favour of farming, taking over the running of Dunford Farm when Richard died in 1809. A poor business man, he sold the property when the farm failed and moved the family to a smaller farm at nearby Gullard&#x27;s Oak. Conditions did not improve and by 1814, after several more moves, the family eventually settled as tenant farmers in West Meon, near Alton in Hampshire.

Cobden attended a dame school and then Bowes Hall School in the North Riding of Yorkshire.

===Early business career===
When fifteen years of age he went to London to the warehouse business of his uncle Richard Ware Cole where he became a commercial traveller in muslin and calico. His relative, noting the lad&#x27;s passionate addiction to study, solemnly warned him against indulging such a taste, as likely to prove a fatal obstacle to his success in commercial life. Cobden was undeterred and made good use of the library of the London Institution. When his uncle&#x27;s business failed, he joined that of Partridge &amp; Price, in Eastcheap, one of the partners being his uncle&#x27;s former partner.

In 1828, Cobden set up his own business with Sheriff and Gillet, partly with capital from John Lewis, acting as London agents for Fort Brothers, Manchester calico printers. In 1831, the partners sought to lease a factory from Fort&#x27;s at Sabden, near Clitheroe, Lancashire. They had, however, insufficient capital between them. Cobden and his colleagues so impressed Fort&#x27;s that they consented to retain a substantial proportion of the equity. The new firm prospered and soon had three establishments – the printing works at Sabden and sales outlets in London and Manchester. The Manchester outlet came under the direct management of Cobden, who settled there in 1832, beginning a long association with the city. He lived in a house on Quay Street, which is now called Cobden House. A plaque commemorates his residency. The success of the enterprise was decisive and rapid, and the &quot;Cobden prints&quot; soon became well known for their quality.

Had Cobden devoted all his energies to the business, he might soon have become very wealthy. His earnings in the business were typically £8,000 to £10,000 a year. However, his lifelong habit of learning and inquiry absorbed much of his time. Writing under the byname &quot;Libra&quot;, he published many letters in the &quot;Manchester Times&quot; discussing commercial and economic questions. Some of his ideas were influenced by Adam Smith.

===First publications===

In 1835, he published his first pamphlet, entitled &quot;England, Ireland and America, by a Manchester Manufacturer&quot;. 

Cobden advocated the principles of peace, non-intervention, retrenchment and free trade to which he continued faithfully to abide. He paid a visit to the United States, landing in New York on 7 June 1835. He devoted about three months to this tour, passing rapidly through the seaboard states and the adjacent portion of Canada, and collecting as he went large stores of information respecting the condition, resources and prospects of the nation. Another work appeared towards the end of 1836, under the title of &quot;Russia&quot;. It was designed to combat a wild outbreak of Russophobia inspired by David Urquhart. It contained also a bold indictment of the whole system of foreign policy founded on ideas of the balance of power and the necessity of large armaments for the protection of commerce.

===Travel===
Bad health obliged him to leave Britain, and for several months, at the end of 1836 and the beginning of 1837, he travelled in Spain, Turkey and Egypt. During his visit to Egypt he had an interview with Muhammad Ali, of whose character as a reforming monarch he did not bring away a very favourable impression. He returned to Britain in April 1837. He also visited the United States in this period.

===First steps in politics===
Cobden soon became a conspicuous figure in Manchester political and intellectual life. He championed the foundation of the Manchester Athenaeum and delivered its inaugural address. He was a member of the chamber of commerce and was part of the campaign for the incorporation of the city, being elected one of its first aldermen. He began also to take a warm interest in the cause of popular education. Some of his first attempts in public speaking were at meetings which he convened at Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Rochdale and other adjacent towns, to advocate the establishment of British schools. It was while on a mission for this purpose to Rochdale that he first formed the acquaintance of John Bright. In 1837, the death of William IV and the accession of Queen Victoria led to a general election. Cobden was candidate for Stockport, but was narrowly defeated.

Other interests included his friendship with George Combe and his involvement with the Manchester Phrenological Society in the 1830s and 1840s. In 1850, he asked Combe to provide a phrenological reading of his son.

===Corn Laws===

The &quot;Corn Laws&quot; were taxes on imported grain designed to keep prices high for cereal producers in Great Britain. The laws indeed did raise food prices and became the focus of opposition from urban areas, which then had far less political representation than rural Britain. The corn laws imposed steep import duties, reducing the quantity of grain imported from other countries, even when food supplies were short. The laws were supported by Conservative landowners and opposed by Whig industrialists and workers. The Anti-Corn Law League was responsible for turning public and ruling-class opinion against the laws. It was a large, nationwide, middle-class moral crusade with a utopian vision. Its leading advocate was Richard Cobden. According to historian Asa Briggs, Cobden repeatedly promised that repeal would settle four great problems simultaneously:

In 1838, the league was formed in Manchester; on Cobden&#x27;s suggestion, it became a national association, the Anti-Corn Law League. During the league&#x27;s seven years, Cobden was its chief spokesman and animating spirit. He was not afraid to take his challenge in person to the agricultural landlords or to confront the working class Chartists, led by Feargus O&#x27;Connor.

In 1841, Sir Robert Peel having defeated the Melbourne ministry in parliament, there was a general election, and Cobden was returned as the new member for Stockport. His opponents had confidently predicted that he would fail utterly in the House of Commons. He did not wait long after his admission into that assembly in bringing their predictions to the test. Parliament met on 19 August. On the 24th, during the debate on the Queen&#x27;s Speech, Cobden delivered his first address. &quot;It was remarked,&quot; reported Harriet Martineau in her &quot;History of the Peace&quot;, &quot;that he was not treated in the House with the courtesy usually accorded to a new member, and it was perceived that he did not need such observance.&quot; Undeterred, he gave a simple and forceful exposition of his position on the Corn Laws. This marked the start of his reputation as a master of the issues.

On 21 April 1842, with 67 other MPs, Cobden voted for the motion of William Sharman Crawford (a fellow Anti-Corn Law Leaguer) to form a committee to consider the demands of the People&#x27;s Charter (1838): votes for working men, protected by secret ballot. 

On 17 February 1843, Cobden launched an attack on Peel, holding him responsible for the miserable and disaffected state of the nation&#x27;s workers. Peel did not respond in the debate but the speech was made at a time of heightened political feelings. Edward Drummond, Peel&#x27;s private secretary, had recently been mistaken for the prime minister and shot dead in the street by a lunatic. However, later in the evening, Peel referred in excited and agitated tones to the remark, as an incitement to violence against his person. Peel&#x27;s Tory party, catching at this hint, threw themselves into a frantic state of excitement, and when Cobden attempted to explain that he meant official, not personal responsibility, he was drowned out.

Peel reversed his position and in 1846 called for the repeal of the Corn Laws. Cobden and the League had prepared the moment for years but they played little role in 1846. After Peel&#x27;s aggressive politicking, the repeal of the Corn Laws passed the House of Commons on 16 May 1846 by 98 votes. Peel had formed a coalition of the Conservative leadership and a third of its MPs joining with the Whigs, with two-thirds of the Conservatives voting against him. That split Peel&#x27;s Tory party and led to the fall of his government. 

In Peels resignation speech he credited Cobden, more than anyone else, with the repeal of the Corn Laws.
===Tribute, journey and resettlement===

Cobden had sacrificed his business, his domestic comforts and for a time his health to the campaign. His friends therefore felt that the nation owed him some substantial token of gratitude and admiration for those sacrifices. Public subscription raised the sum of £80,000. Had he been inspired with personal ambition, he might have entered upon the race of political advancement with the prospect of attaining the highest office. Lord John Russell, who, soon after the repeal of the Corn Laws, succeeded Peel as prime minister, invited Cobden to join his government but Cobden declined the invitation.

Cobden had hoped to find some restorative privacy abroad but his fame had spread throughout Europe and he found himself lionised by the radical movement. In July 1846, he wrote to a friend &quot;I am going to tell you of a fresh project that has been brewing in my brain. I have given up all idea of burying myself in Egypt or Italy. I am going on an agitating tour through the continent of Europe.&quot; He referred to invitations he had received from France, Prussia, Austria, Russia and Spain and added, Well, I will, with God&#x27;s assistance during the next twelve months, visit all the large states of Europe, see their potentates or statesmen, and endeavour to enforce those truths which have been irresistible at home. Why should I rust in inactivity? If the public spirit of my countrymen affords me the means of travelling as their missionary, I will be the first ambassador from the people of this country to the nations of the continent. I am impelled to this by an instinctive emotion such as has never deceived me. I feel that I could succeed in making out a stronger case for the prohibitive nations of Europe to compel them to adopt a freer system than I had here to overturn our protection policy.
He visited in succession France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Russia, and was honoured everywhere he went. He not only addressed public demonstrations but also had several private audiences with leading statesmen. During his absence there was a general election, and he was returned (1847) for Stockport and for the West Riding of Yorkshire. He chose to sit for the latter.

In June 1848 Richard Cobden moved his family from Manchester to Paddington, London, taking a house at 103 Westbourne Terrace. In
1847 he had also repurchased the old family home at Dunford and in 1852 or 1853 rebuilt the house there, which he then continued to occupy until his death.

===Pacifist activism===

When Cobden returned from abroad, he addressed himself to what seemed to him the logical complement of free trade, namely, the promotion of peace and the reduction of naval and military armaments. He was a supporter of non-interventionism and his abhorrence of war amounted to a passion and, in fact, his campaigns against the Corn Laws were motivated by his belief that free trade was a powerful force for peace and defence against war. He knowingly exposed himself to the risk of ridicule and the reproach of utopianism. In 1849, he brought forward a proposal in parliament in favour of international arbitration, and, in 1851, a motion for mutual reduction of armaments. He was not successful in either case, nor did he expect to be. In pursuance of the same object, he identified himself with a series of peace congresses which from 1848 to 1851 were held successively in Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, London, Manchester and Edinburgh.

In his opposition to the Opium Wars, Cobden argued that just as &quot;in the slave trade we [the British] had surpassed in guilt the world, so in foreign wars we have the most aggressive, quarelsome, warlike and bloody nation under the sun.&quot; In October 1850 he wrote a letter to Joseph Sturge, claiming that in the last 25 years &quot;you will find that we have been incomparably the most sanguinary nation on earth... in China, in Burma, in India, New Zealand, the Cape, Syria, Spain, Portugal, Greece, etc, there is hardly a country, however remote, in which we have not been waging war or dictating our terms at the point of a bayonet.&quot; Cobden believed that the British, &quot;the greatest blood-shedders of all&quot;, had been then involved in more wars than the rest of Europe put together. In this, Cobden blamed the British aristocracy, which he claimed had &quot;converted the combativeness of the English race to its own ends&quot;.

In April 1852, when the British declared war on Burma for the mistreatment of two British sea captains by the Burmese government, Cobden was &quot;amazed&quot; at the &quot;casus belli&quot; for the war:

Cobden published &quot;How Wars are got up in India: The Origins of the Burmese War&quot; in 1853. In the work he theorized why similar disputes with the United States never culminated in war. According to Cobden, the reason was &quot;that America is powerful and Burma weak... Britain would not have acted in this manner towards a power capable of defending itself.&quot;

On the establishment of the Second French Empire in 1851–1852, a violent panic, fuelled by the press, gripped the public. Louis Napoleon was represented as contemplating a sudden and piratical descent upon the British coast without pretext or provocation. By a series of speeches and pamphlets, in and out of parliament, Cobden sought to calm the passions of his countrymen. In doing so, he sacrificed the great popularity he had won as the champion of free trade, and became for a time the best-abused man in Britain.

However, owing to the quarrel about the religious sites of Palestine, which arose in the east of Europe, public opinion suddenly veered round, and all the suspicion and hatred which had been directed against the emperor of the French were diverted from him to the emperor of Russia. Louis Napoleon was taken into favour as Britain&#x27;s faithful ally, and in a whirlwind of popular excitement the nation was swept into the Crimean War.

Again confronting public sentiment, Cobden, who had travelled in Turkey, and had studied its politics, was dismissive of the outcry about maintaining the independence and integrity of the Ottoman Empire. He denied that it was possible to maintain them, and no less strenuously denied that it was desirable. He believed that the jealousy of Russian aggrandisement and the dread of Russian power were absurd exaggerations. He maintained that the future of European Turkey was in the hands of the Christian population, and that it would have been wiser for Britain to ally herself with them rather than with what he saw as the doomed and decaying Islamic power. He said in the House of Commons You must address yourselves as men of sense and men of energy, to the question – what are you to do with the Christian population? For Mahommedanism [Islam] cannot be maintained, and I should be sorry to see this country fighting for the maintenance of Mahommedanism ... You may keep Turkey on the map of Europe, you may call the country by the name of Turkey if you like, but do not think you can keep up the Mahommedan rule in the country. The torrent of popular sentiment in favour of war was, however, irresistible; and both Cobden and John Bright were overwhelmed with obloquy. Karl Marx wrote &quot;And without total abandonment of the law of the Koran [argues opposition MP Cobden], it was impossible to put the Christians of Turkey upon an equality with the Turks. We may as well ask Mr Cobden whether, with the existing State Church and laws of England, it is possible to put her working-men upon an equality with the Cobdens and the Brights?&quot;

===Second Opium War===
At the beginning of 1857 tidings from China reached Britain of a rupture between the British plenipotentiary in that country and the governor of the Canton province in reference to a small vessel or lorcha called the &quot;Arrow&quot;, which had resulted in the British admiral destroying the river forts, burning 23 ships belonging to the Qing Navy and bombarding the city of Canton. After a careful investigation of the official documents, Cobden became convinced that those were utterly unrighteous proceedings. He brought forward a motion in parliament to this effect, which led to a long and memorable debate, lasting over four nights, in which he was supported by Sidney Herbert, Sir James Graham, William Gladstone, Lord John Russell and Benjamin Disraeli, and which ended in the defeat of Lord Palmerston by a majority of sixteen.

But this triumph cost him his seat in parliament. On the dissolution which followed Lord Palmerston&#x27;s defeat, Cobden became candidate for Huddersfield, but the voters of that town gave the preference to his opponent, who had supported the Russian war and approved of the proceedings at Canton. Cobden was thus relegated to private life, and retiring to his country house at Dunford, he spent his time in perfect contentment in cultivating his land and feeding his pigs.

He took advantage of this season of leisure to pay another visit to the United States. During his absence the general election of 1859 occurred, when he was returned unopposed for Rochdale. Lord Palmerston was again prime minister, and having discovered that the advanced liberal party was not so easily &quot;crushed&quot; as he had apprehended, he made overtures of reconciliation, and invited Cobden and Thomas Milner Gibson to become members of his government. In a frank, cordial letter which was delivered to Cobden on his landing in Liverpool, Lord Palmerston offered him the role of President of the Board of Trade, with a seat in the Cabinet. Many of his friends urgently pressed him to accept but without a moment&#x27;s hesitation he determined to decline the proposed honour. On his arrival in London he called on Lord Palmerston, and with the utmost frankness told him that he had opposed and denounced him so frequently in public, and that he still differed so widely from his views, especially on questions of foreign policy, that he could not, without doing violence to his own sense of duty and consistency, serve under him as minister. Lord Palmerston tried good-humouredly to combat his objections, but without success.

===Cobden–Chevalier Treaty===
Though Cobden declined to share the responsibility of Lord Palmerston&#x27;s administration, he was willing to act as its representative in promoting freer commercial intercourse between Britain and France. But the negotiations for this purpose originated with himself in conjunction with Bright and Michel Chevalier. Towards the close of 1859 he called upon Lord Palmerston, Lord John Russell and Gladstone, and signified his intention to visit France and get into communication with Napoleon III of France and his ministers, with a view to promoting this object. These statesmen expressed in general terms their approval of his purpose, but he went entirely on his own account, clothed at first with no official authority. On his arrival in Paris he had a long audience with Napoleon, in which he urged many arguments in favour of removing those obstacles which prevented the two countries from being brought into closer dependence on one another, and he succeeded in making a considerable impression on his mind in favour of free trade. He then addressed himself to the French ministers, and had much earnest conversation, especially with Eugène Rouher, whom he found well inclined to the economical and commercial principles which he advocated. After a good deal of time spent in these preliminary and unofficial negotiations, the question of a treaty of commerce between the two countries having entered into the arena of diplomacy, Cobden was requested by the British government to act as their plenipotentiary in the matter in conjunction with Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley, their ambassador in France. But it proved a very long and laborious undertaking. He had to contend with the bitter hostility of the French protectionists, which occasioned a good deal of vacillation on the part of the emperor and his ministers. There were also delays, hesitations and cavils at home, which were more inexplicable.
He was, moreover, assailed with great violence by a powerful section of the British press, while the large number of minute details with which he had to deal in connection with proposed changes in the French tariff, involved a tax on his patience and industry which would have daunted a less resolute man. But there was one source of embarrassment greater than all the rest. One strong motive which had impelled him to engage in this enterprise was his anxious desire to establish more friendly relations between Britain and France, and to dispel those feelings of mutual jealousy and alarm which were so frequently breaking forth and jeopardizing peace between the two countries. This was the most powerful argument with which he had plied the emperor and the members of the French government, and which he had found most efficacious with them. But while he was in the midst of the negotiations, Lord Palmerston brought forward in the House of Commons a measure for fortifying the naval arsenals of Britain, which he introduced in a warlike speech pointedly directed against France, as the source of danger of invasion and attack, against which it was necessary to guard. This produced irritation and resentment in Paris, and but for the influence which Cobden had acquired, and the perfect trust reposed in his sincerity, the negotiations would probably have been altogether wrecked. At last, however, after nearly twelve months&#x27; incessant labour, the work was completed in November 1860. &quot;Rare,&quot; said Mr Gladstone, &quot;is the privilege of any man who, having fourteen years ago rendered to his country one signal service, now again, within the same brief span of life, decorated neither by land nor title, bearing no mark to distinguish him from the people he loves, has been permitted to perform another great and memorable service to his sovereign and his country.&quot;

On the conclusion of this work honours were offered to Cobden by the governments of both the countries which he had so greatly benefited. Lord Palmerston offered him a baronetcy and a seat in the privy council, and the emperor of the French would gladly have conferred upon him some distinguished mark of his favour. But with characteristic disinterestedness and modesty he declined all such honours.

Cobden&#x27;s efforts in furtherance of free trade were always subordinated to what he deemed the highest moral purposes: the promotion of peace on earth and goodwill among men. This was his desire and hope as respects the commercial treaty with France. He was therefore deeply disappointed and distressed to find the old feeling of distrust still actively fomented by the press and some of the leading politicians of the country. In 1862 he published his pamphlet entitled &quot;The Three Panics&quot;, the object of which was to trace the history and expose the folly of those periodical visitations of alarm as to French designs with which Britain had been afflicted for the preceding fifteen or sixteen years.

===American Civil War===
When the American Civil War threatened to break out in the United States, Cobden was deeply distressed, but after the conflict became inevitable his sympathies were wholly with the Union because the Confederacy was fighting for slavery. Nonetheless, his great anxiety was that the British nation should not be committed to any unworthy course during the progress of that struggle. When relations with the United States were becoming critical and menacing as a consequence of depredations committed against the United States by aid to the Confederacy from blockade runners and Confederate commerce raiders issuing from British ports respectively, actions that would lead to the post-war Alabama Claims, he brought the question before the House of Commons in a series of speeches of rare clearness and force.

===Character and motivations===
Cobden was characterised from his early years by energy and sociability, but also particularly by a desire to learn and understand the traits of the world, a characteristic that stayed with him throughout his life.
He had many friends from many walks of life.

Disraeli commended Cobden on his careful art of avoiding to drive his arguments to an extremity, which was one secret of his singular persuasiveness. 

Cobden may have been disappointed that improvements in material wealth did not bring moral improvements. He wrote towards the end of his life &quot;Nations have not yet learnt to bear prosperity, liberty, and peace. They will learn it in a higher state of civilization. We think we are the models for posterity, when we are little better than beacons to help it to avoid the rocks and quicksands. The world is sadly slow to learn...&quot;

==Death==

For several years Cobden was unwell with bronchial irritation and difficulty of breathing. Owing to this he had spent the winter of 1860 in Algeria, and every subsequent winter he confined himself to the house, especially in damp and foggy weather. He remained intellectually engaged in seeking international peace and other themes. On 2 April 1865 he died peacefully at his apartments in London. He was buried at West Lavington church in West Sussex on 7 April. A large funeral procession assembled at Cocking Causeway to process to the church a mile away. His grave was surrounded by a large crowd of mourners, among whom were Gladstone, Bright, Milner Gibson, Charles Villiers and a host besides from all parts of the country.

===Tributes===
On the day after his death Lord Palmerston said &quot;it was not possible for the House to proceed to business without every member recalling to his mind the great loss which the House and country had sustained by the event which took place yesterday morning.&quot; Disraeli said that the verdict of posterity would be that Cobden was the greatest political character that the pure middle class of this country had yet produced, and that he &quot;was an ornament to the House of Commons and an honour to England.&quot;

In the French Corps Législatif, also, the vice-president, Forcade La Roquette, referred to his death, and warm expressions of esteem were repeated and applauded on every side. &quot;The death of Richard Cobden,&quot; said M. la Roquette, &quot;is not alone a misfortune for England (UK), but a cause of mourning for France and humanity.&quot; Drouyn de Lhuys, the French minister of foreign affairs, made his death the subject of a special despatch, desiring the French ambassador to express to the government &quot;the mournful sympathy and truly national regret which the death, as lamented as premature, of Richard Cobden had excited on that side of the English Channel ... He is above all&quot;, he added, &quot;in our eyes the representative of those sentiments and those cosmopolitan principles before which national frontiers and rivalries disappear; whilst essentially of his country, he was still more of his time; he knew what mutual relations could accomplish in our day for the prosperity of peoples. Cobden, if I may be permitted to say so, was an international man.&quot; 

Cobden has been called &quot;the greatest classical-liberal thinker on international affairs&quot; by the libertarian and historian Ralph Raico.

==Personal life==
In 1840, Cobden married Catherine Anne Williams, a Welsh woman. They had five surviving daughters. Of these, Jane, a British Liberal politician, married the publisher Thomas Fisher Unwin and was known as Mrs Cobden Unwin; Ellen was a published writer and the first of the painter Walter Sickert&#x27;s three wives; and Anne married the bookbinder T. J. Sanderson and he added her surname to his. In 1856, their only son died aged 15 after a short scarlet fever illness. Two other children died in infancy.

Cobden was committed to his family, although his public life was absorbing.

==Legacy==
Cobden, and what was called &quot;Cobdenism&quot; and later identified with &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, was subjected to much criticism from the school of British economists who advocated protectionism, on the ideas of Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List. However, during much of what remained of the nineteenth century, his success with the free-trade movement was unchallenged, and protectionism came to be heterodox. The tariff reform movement in Britain started by Joseph Chamberlain brought new opponents of Manchesterism, and the whole subject once more became controversial. The years of reconstruction following World War II saw a renewed fashion for government intervention in international trade but, starting in the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher in the UK (under the influence of Enoch Powell via Keith Joseph) and Ronald Reagan in the U.S. led a revival of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; that, , holds some sway in mainstream economic thinking.

Cobden left a deep mark on British history. Although he was not a &quot;scientific economist&quot;, many of his ideas and prophecies prefigured arguments and perspectives that would later appear in academic economics. He considered that it was &quot;natural&quot; for Britain to manufacture for the world and exchange for agricultural products of other countries. Modern economists call this comparative advantage. He advocated the repeal of the Corn Laws, which not only made food cheaper, but helped develop industry and benefit labour. He correctly saw that other countries would be unable to compete with Britain in manufacture in the foreseeable future. &quot;We advocate&quot;, he said, &quot;nothing but what is agreeable to the highest behests of Christianity – to buy in the cheapest market, and sell in the dearest.&quot; After the repeal of the Corn Laws, British manufacturing did see significant productivity rises, while British agriculture ultimately went into decline due to import competition. He perceived that the rest of the world should follow Britain&#x27;s example: &quot;if you abolish the corn-laws honestly, and adopt free trade in its simplicity, there will not be a tariff in Europe that will not be changed in less than five years&quot; (January 1846). His cosmopolitanism, which led to the perception among Cobden&#x27;s rivals that he was a Little Englander&quot; – led him to develop an opposition to colonialism. Cobden also saw the connection between peace and free trade. &quot;Peace will come to earth when the people have more to do with each other and governments less.&quot; &quot;The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is – in extending our commercial relations – to have with them as little political connection as possible.&quot;

His biography, &quot;Richard Cobden&#x27;s Life&quot; by John Morley, written with the input of contemporaries such as John Bright and Sir Louis Mallet, was published in 1881 (Roberts Brothers: Boston).

In 1866, the Cobden Club was founded to promote &quot;Peace, Free Trade and Goodwill Among Nations&quot;. This was due to the efforts of Thomas Bayley Potter, Cobden&#x27;s successor at his Rochdale seat, who wanted an institution which would support Cobden&#x27;s principles. On 15 May 1866 the inaugural meeting of the club was held at the Reform Club in London and the first club dinner was held on 21 July 1866 at the Star and Garter Hotel in Richmond, presided over by Gladstone. The club energetically diffused free trade literature for propaganda purposes.

Prizes were instituted in Cobdens name at Oxford and Cambridge.

Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s proposal for Tariff Reform, launched in 1903, reignited the free trade versus protectionism debate in Britain. For the centenary of Cobden&#x27;s birth 10,000 people assembled at Alexandra Palace in London in June 1904. Cobden &quot;symbolized the liberal vision of a peaceful, prosperous global order held together by the benign forces of Free Trade&quot; like no other nineteenth century figure. Addressing the meeting, the Liberal leader Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman said:

The motive which inspired those who composed the assemblage was twofold. They wished to show their admiration of, and their gratitude towards, a great Englishman whose sympathetic heart, wisdom, intuition, courage and praise-worthy eloquence wrought for them a great deliverance in the days of their fathers. They also wished to declare their adherence to the doctrines which he taught, and their determination that the power of those doctrines should not, God helping them, be impaired. What they owed to him and to themselves was to make it clear in the sight of all men that they meant to hold fast to the heritage which he, perhaps more than any other individual, won for them; and that the fruits of the battle which he waged against tremendous odds should not be lightly wrested from them. They were not there to acclaim Cobden as an inspired prophet, but they saw in him a great citizen, a great statesman, a great patriot, and a great and popular leader... Cobden spent his life in pulling down those artificial restrictions and obstructions which at the present time rash and reckless men were seeking to set up again – obstructions not merely to commerce, but also to peace and good will, and mutual understanding; yes, and obstructions to liberty and good government at home. Those who expressed astonishment that the intelligent workman did not look askance at the manufacturer, Cobden, had overlooked the fact that he gave the people cheap food and abundant employment, and did far more; that he exploded the economic basis of class government and class subjection.

Stanley Baldwin said in December 1930, during the Great Depression, that the Conservatives were &quot;a national party of all those who believe that any improvement in the industrial and economic position of this country can only be achieved by cutting loose from the Cobdenism of the last generation and putting this country on what is and must be a protectionist basis&quot;. Two weeks later Baldwin attacked the Labour government&#x27;s handling of the Imperial Conference: &quot;At that Conference the Government had a splendid opportunity of doing something practical to help British industry and to bind the Empire together in a close partnership of trade. They failed to seize this opportunity because the Dominion proposals could not be reconciled with the ancient and obsolete free-trade theories of Cobdenism&quot;. Britain abandoned free trade in 1932 and adopted a general tariff. In 1932 the former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden said there was never a greater mistake than to say that Cobdenism was dead: &quot;Cobdenism was never more alive throughout the world than it was to-day... To-day the ideas of Cobden were in revolt against selfish nationalism. The need for the breaking down of trade restrictions, which took various forms, was universally recognized even by those who were unable to throw off those shackles&quot;. F. W. Hirst said in 1941, during the Second World War, that Cobden&#x27;s ideas &quot;stand out in almost complete opposition to the &#x27;gospel&#x27; according to Marx&quot;:

Cobden&#x27;s international ideas were based on patriotism and peace, the harmony of classes, reform by constitutional methods, goodwill among men and nations. Cobden... believed in individual liberty and enterprise, in free markets, freedom of opinion and freedom of trade. [His] whole creed was anathema to Karl Marx. He had no sense of patriotism or love of country. He urged what he called &quot;the proletariat&quot; in all countries to overthrow society by a violent revolution, to destroy the middle classes and all employers of labour, whom he denounced as capitalists and slave drivers. He demanded the confiscation of private property and a new dictatorship, the dictatorship of the proletariat. Just as Cobden interpreted and practised the precepts of Adam Smith, so Lenin interpreted and practised the precepts of Karl Marx. These two great men though dead yet speak. They stand out before the civilised world as protagonists of two systems of political economy, political thought and human society... when this war is over, we in Britain will certainly have to choose whether our Press and Parliament are to be free, whether we are to be a conscript nation, whether private property and savings are to be secured or confiscated, whether we are to be imprisoned without trial; whether we are again to enjoy the right of buying and selling where and how we please – in short whether we are to be ruled as slaves by the bureaucracy of a police state or as free men by our chosen representatives. This conflict will be symbolised and personified by Richard Cobden and Karl Marx.

Ernest Bevin, Labour Foreign Secretary, said on 26 July 1947 that &quot;We cannot go back to the Cobdenite economy&quot;. In 1966 the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson attacked Philip Snowden for holding the views of &quot;Puritan Cobdenism&quot; which &quot;prevented any expansionist action to relieve unemployment&quot; by the government during the Great Depression.

===Locations===
Cobden&#x27;s great-great-great- grandson, Nick Cobden-Wright, started a campaign to save his former home, Dunford House, Midhurst (also home to his daughter Annie, a socialist and suffragette) from sale in 2019 by its owners, the YMCA. It contained her banner &#x27;No Vote No Tax&#x27; which she had held at the Downing Street protest. His Cobden Foundation campaign was backed by Emmeline Pankhurst&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Helen Pankhurst, CBE, among others.

The communities of Cobden, Ontario, Cobden, Illinois, Cobden, Minnesota and Cobden, Victoria in Canada, the U.S. and Australia, respectively, were all named after Richard Cobden.

Cob Stenham was also named after him. 

Cobden in the South Island of New Zealand is named after him.

Richard Cobden Primary School in Camden Town and Grade II listed Cobden Working Mens Club in Kensal Road, North Kensington, London are named after him.

Cobden Bridge in Southampton was named after him.

Cobden Street in Bury, Darlington, Dalton in Furness Nottingham and Nelson, Lancashire are all named after him. There is a Cobden Square in Bedford and a Cobden Road in Worthing and Midhurst. Next to Cobden Street in Nottingham there is also Bright Street. There are two Cobden Streets in Burnley, Lancashire.. In Edinburgh there is a Cobden Street and a Cobden Terrace.

The Richard Cobden pub in Worthing is named after him and the Cobden View pub in Sheffield has his face above the door. There was a Richard Cobden pub in Cocking, West Sussex which closed and became a private residence in the 20th century. The Richard Cobden pub in Chatham, Kent is named after him and later became the subject of the song &quot;The Richard Cobden&quot; by the UK band Vlks. There is also a pub in Quarry Street, Woolton, Liverpool named The Cobden, with his image on the external sign board.

===Statues===
A bronze statue of Cobden is in St Ann&#x27;s Square in Manchester (pictured above) and his bust is in Manchester Town Hall.

There is a statue of him, funded by public subscription (to which Napoléon III contributed) in the square by Mornington Crescent Underground station, Camden Town, London. The Cobden pub on Camden High Street is in turn named after the statue.

The statue of Cobden in Stockport town centre was moved in 2006 as part of an urban regeneration scheme, but is now back in place.

Inside the Bradford Wool Exchange, West Yorkshire, there is a statue of Cobden.

Outside the Wool Exchange, between the ground floor arches, are carved portraits of notable people, including Cobden (the others are Titus Salt, Stephenson, Watt, Arkwright, Jacquard, Gladstone and Palmerston and (facing Bank Street) Raleigh, Drake, Columbus, Cook and Anson). Flanking the porched entrance below the tower are statues of Bishop Blaise, the patron saint of woolcombers, and King Edward III, who greatly promoted the wool trade.

An obelisk erected in Cobden&#x27;s memory in 1868 is located at West Lavington in West Sussex. Upon the statue are the words &quot;Free Trade. Peace Goodwill Among Nations&quot;.

====Bust====
A bust of Cobden is located in the west aisle of the north transept of Westminster Abbey.

<text>There are 21 protected areas of the United States designated as national preserves. They were established by an act of Congress to protect areas that have resources often associated with national parks but where certain natural resource-extractive activities such as hunting and mining may be permitted, provided their natural values are preserved. The activities permitted in each national preserve vary depending on the enabling legislation of the unit. All national preserves are managed by the National Park Service (NPS) as part of the National Park System. 

Eleven national preserves are co-managed with national parks or national monuments; because hunting is forbidden in those units, preserves provide a similar level of protection from development but allow hunting and in some cases grazing. Nine of those are counted as separate official units, while New River Gorge National Park and Preserve and Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve are each single units, though there is no administrative difference. The remaining ten are stand-alone units. Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve has a preserve site that is managed like one, but is not distinguished as a national preserve in the authorizing legislation and is not listed here. The Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve is a unique designation that is dissimilar to national preserves. 

National preserves are located in eleven states; Alaska is home to ten of them, including the largest, Noatak National Preserve. Their total area is , 86% of which is in Alaska. All national preserves except Tallgrass Prairie permit hunting in accordance with local regulations. A national preserve differs from a national reserve as management of reserves can be delegated to the state in which they are located. 

== History ==

The first national preserves were Big Thicket National Preserve in Texas and Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida, both established in 1974. The Big Cypress Swamp, adjacent to Everglades National Park and originally intended to be included in it, was at risk of destruction by a proposed airport. Opposition by conservationists and studies showing the swamp&#x27;s role in water protection led to its cancellation after one runway was built, and President Richard Nixon proposed the area&#x27;s preservation as Big Cypress National Fresh Water Reserve to protect the local water supply. Congressional deliberation resulted in a new designation of a national preserve that bought out private landowners to conserve &quot;the natural, scenic, hydrologic, floral and faunaI, and recreational values of the Big Cypress Watershed,&quot; though off-road vehicle use, oil extraction, hunting, and traditional use by the Miccosukee and Seminole Tribes are permitted.

The Big Thicket, a large area of swamps and forests, was originally proposed to be preserved as a state park or national park, but these were opposed by timber firms who wanted to retain their logging lands. A 1967 survey by the National Park Service proposed establishing nine units representative of the variety of plant life in the region, but because the thicket was already fragmented by roads and logging, it would not qualify as a national park. National monument was also deemed a suboptimal designation, and compromise on the boundary and management provisions eventually led to its establishment as a national preserve. The bills creating both preserves were signed on the same day by President Gerald Ford and contained similar wording limiting construction, agriculture, and mineral extraction to that still assuring the area&#x27;s &quot;natural and ecological integrity in perpetuity,&quot; while permitting hunting. 

Following President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 1978 establishment of 17 national monuments in Alaska, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 redesignated four as national preserves and six as national parks or monuments paired with a preserve. These had been recommended during the legislative process as early as 1974 to resolve the issue of sport hunting at Lake Clark after it was used for Big Thicket and Big Cypress. While this was not the primary factor in the naming of the original national preserves, it presented a compromise to protect scenic lands and allow hunting in the National Park System without breaking precedent in parks and monuments that forbid it. The national preserves are managed in the same way as national parks, except that regulated hunting, fishing, and trapping for sport and subsistence are permitted, though the NPS can close areas to such practices as needed. Although hunting was also allowed at most national recreation areas, this was a major change in NPS wildlife management with a fifth of its land now open to it.

Five new units were established from 1988 to 2000, two of which are partnerships with local governments and landowners. The Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve includes sites owned by Florida State Parks, the city of Jacksonville, and private landowners. The Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve is so designated to accommodate a public-private partnership reducing federal land ownership, and it is almost entirely owned by The Nature Conservancy. Valles Caldera National Preserve was originally established in 2000 to be operated by an independent trust, but its management was transferred to the National Park Service in 2015.

The four most recently established national preserves were all expansions or redesignations of existing NPS sites. Great Sand Dunes National Monument was redesignated a national park, and the mountainous wilderness area transferred to it from the U.S. Forest Service became the preserve. President Bill Clinton expanded Craters of the Moon National Monument using the Antiquities Act, and most of the expanded area was redesignated a national preserve two years later to permit hunting. Oregon Caves National Monument gained its preserve lands from Rogue River–Siskiyou National Forest, increasing the unit&#x27;s size ninefold. Ten percent of New River Gorge National River was redesignated a national park where hunting was disallowed, and the remainder became New River Gorge National Preserve with little change.

== List of national preserves ==

Preserves paired with a national park or monument do not have visitation separately recorded. Their combined visitor counts are marked in italics, as the number visiting the preserve portions may be substantially smaller. Among these eleven, only Lake Clark and Wrangell–St. Elias have most of their facilities in the preserve.

<text>National Historic Site (NHS) and National Historical Park (NHP) are designations for officially recognized areas of nationally historic significance in the United States. They are usually owned and managed by the federal government. An NHS usually contains a single historical feature directly associated with its subject, while an NHP is an area that generally extends beyond single properties or buildings to include a mix of historic and later structures and sometimes significant natural features.

As of 2024, there are 63 NHPs and 85 NHSes. Most NHPs and NHSs are managed by the National Park Service (NPS). Some federally designated sites are owned by local authorities or privately owned, but are authorized to request assistance from the NPS as affiliated areas. One property is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, Grey Towers National Historic Site.

Since October 15, 1966, all historic areas, including NHPs and NHSs, in the NPS are automatically listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). There are also about 90,000 NRHP sites, the large majority of which are neither owned nor managed by the NPS. Of these, about 2,600 have been designated at the highest status as National Historic Landmark (NHL) sites.

== History ==
After its founding in 1916, the National Park Service initially oversaw sites of primarily scenic and natural significance, including national parks and national monuments. Historians soon began recommending preservation of sites relating to human history. Congress created Colonial National Monument in 1930 to protect the Jamestown Settlement and Yorktown battlefield in Virginia as one of the first new historical areas, and it was renamed a national historical park in 1936. It then established Morristown National Historical Park, the 1779–1780 winter encampment of the Continental Army in New Jersey, on March 2, 1933, as the first NHP: The U.S. House committee noted that the new designation was logical for the area and set a new precedent, with comparison to the national military parks, which were then in the War Department. The park&#x27;s establishment allowed the NPS to have an administrative historical program with professional historians. President Franklin D. Roosevelt reorganized the agency to also oversee memorials and military parks with historic significance later in 1933, substantially broadening the NPS&#x27;s mandate.

In 1935, Congress passed the Historic Sites Act (), which established that &quot;it is a national policy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings and objects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States.&quot; This expanded upon the Antiquities Act of 1906, which gave the President the ability to order &quot;the protection of objects of historic and scientific interest.&quot; The Historic Sites Act directed the National Park Service to survey historic sites which may be of national significance, as well as restore and acquire properties. The Historic American Buildings Survey began to document the country&#x27;s architectural heritage and identify buildings for potential protection. Initially the Secretary of the Interior could designate national historic sites, though this did not include funding for acquition or administration without congressional action. Salem Maritime National Historic Site was the first place to be preserved as a national historic site, created by Secretary Harold L. Ickes&#x27;s secretarial order on March 17, 1938. It had followed his designation of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in 1935; many historic sites in the National Park System continue to be protected under different designation types. Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site was designated later that year, another example of industrial heritage.

As the NPS developed criteria for nationally significant historic sites in the late 1930s, it aimed to identify unique sites that could each tell a broad story and would fit together to cover all aspects of American history. Surveys of sites were guided by themes and chronologies to ensure a diverse and comprehensive selection of those most representative of different eras and geographies, with less political influence over site selection. In the 1950s, the Mission 66 program revived historic studies that had lagged during World War II and saw the creation of the National Historic Landmarks program as a method to recognize important sites. From the 1960s to 1990s, the NPS evolved from a thematic framework, in which numerous specific themes and subthemes of American history were expected to each be included in some way in the system, to a conceptual framework, whereby both new and existing park units would be examined more holistically for ways to study history such as &quot;creating social movements and institutions,&quot; &quot;developing the American economy,&quot; and &quot;peopling places.&quot; In the 20th century, potential new park units have been recommended not so much on &quot;an orderly, balanced, and comprehensive&quot; preservation of &quot;outstanding examples&quot;, as Chief Historian Ronald Lee put it, but on those mandated to be studied by Congress, most of whose requests are recommended against by the NPS.

A 1973 NPS publication outlined policies for administration of historical areas, which were distinct from its natural and recreational areas. This included not only NHSs and NHPs but also national military parks, national battlefields, national battlefield parks, national battlefield sites, national memorials, and some national monuments; at that time there were 178 such areas, and management focused on &quot;maintaining and where necessary restoring the historical integrity of structures, sites and objects significant to the commemoration or illustration of the historical story&quot;. But because most units contained a combination of natural, historic, and recreational lands, the General Authorities Act of 1970 made all areas equal within the National Park System; separate policy manuals for each were replaced in 1975 with one that would tailor policies in each park respective to the purpose of zones within.

==National historic sites==

National historic sites are generally federally owned and administered properties, though some remain under private or local government ownership. There are currently 86 NHSs, of which 76 are official NPS units, 9 are NPS affiliated areas, and one is managed by the United States Forest Service.

Derived from the Historic Sites Act of 1935, a number of NHSs were established by United States Secretaries of the Interior, but most have been authorized by acts of Congress. In 1937, the first NHS was created in Salem, Massachusetts, in order to preserve and interpret the maritime history of New England and the United States.

===National Historic Area===
There is one National Historic Area in the US park system, a unique designation given to the Aleutian World War II National Historic Area. 

===International Historic Site===
There is one International Historic Site in the US park system, a unique designation given to Saint Croix Island, Maine, on the New Brunswick border. The title, given to the site of the first permanent French settlement in America, recognizes the influence that it has had on both Canada and the United States. The NPS does not distinguish among these designations in terms of their preservation or management policies.

===Authorized historic sites===
The following site is not yet owned or formally developed by the National Park Service, but may eventually be owned and established as a national historic site.

==National Historical Parks==

National historical parks tend to be larger and more complex than national historic sites. In the United States, sites are &quot;historic&quot;, while parks are &quot;historical&quot;. The NPS explains that a site can be intrinsically historic, while a park is a modern legal invention. As such, a park is not itself &quot;historic&quot;, but can be called &quot;historical&quot; when it contains historic resources. It is the resources which are historic, not the park. There are 63 national historical parks.

=== International Historical Park ===
Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park was formally established by the United States and Canada in 1998, the year of the centennial of the gold rush the park commemorates. The park comprises Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park in Washington and Alaska (above) and Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site in British Columbia. Tens of thousands of prospectors took this trail in hopes of making their fortunes in the Klondike River district of Yukon.

<doc id="341622" wikidata="Q1154479" url="?curid=341622" title="Nakasendō">
<text>The , also called the , was one of the centrally administered five routes of the Edo period, and one of the two that connected the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Japan at Edo (modern-day Tokyo) to Kyoto. There were 69 stations (staging-posts) between Edo and Kyoto, crossing through Musashi, Kōzuke, Shinano, Mino and Ōmi provinces. In addition to Tokyo and Kyoto, the Nakasendō runs through the modern-day prefectures of Saitama, Gunma, Nagano, Gifu and Shiga, with a total distance of about .

Unlike the coastal Tōkaidō, the Nakasendō traveled inland, hence its name, which can be translated as &quot;中 = central; 山 = mountain; 道 = route&quot; (as opposed to the Tōkaidō, which roughly meant &quot;eastern sea route&quot;). Because it was such a well-developed road, many famous persons, including the haiku master Matsuo Bashō, traveled the road. In the late 1830s Hiroshige also walked the Nakasendo, contributing 46 designs to a series of 69 views of the Nakasendo, which was later completed by Keisai Eisen.

Many people preferred traveling along the Nakasendō because it did not require travelers to ford any rivers.

In Gunma Prefecture, the Nakasendō is featured on the &#x27;na&#x27; card in Jomo Karuta. 

==Pre-Nakasendō==
===Ritsuryō===
Around the beginning of the seventh century, during the beginning of Ritsuryō, the area that would eventually make up the Nakasendō was developed to connect Kinai (modern-day Kansai region, which included the former capital of Japan) with the provinces of the Tōsandō (part of the &quot;gokishichidō&quot;) that lie to the east.

===Sengoku period===
During the Sengoku period, which lasted from the 15th to 17th centuries, the Tōsandō was controlled by the Takeda (Kai Province), Ogasawara (Shinano Province), Kanamori (Hida Province) and Oda (Mino Province) clans. In order to connect the Tōsandō with the Tōkaidō (and Takeda&#x27;s troops with Oda&#x27;s), a road system was developed. This route is generally followed by the modern day national highways numbered 52, 151, 153, and 22.

==Creation of the Nakasendō==

In the early years of the Edo period, many political, legal, cultural and intellectual changes took place. Among them was the rejuvenation of Japan&#x27;s thousand-year-old highway system. Five roads were formally nominated as official routes for the use of the &quot;shōgun&quot; and the other &quot;daimyō&quot; and to provide the Tokugawa shogunate with the communications network that it needed to stabilize and rule the country. One of these five roads was the Nakasendō, which stretched from Edo, from where the shogun wielded the real power, through the central mountain ranges of Honshu and on to Kyoto.

Until the establishment of these formal trade routes, many shorter routes had existed, connecting towns over various distances. For example, the Kisoji route&#x27;s eleven post towns all become part of the Nakasendō (from Niekawa-juku to Magome-juku). Prior to the Edo period, the route had been called both &quot;Sandō&quot; (山道 &quot;mountain route&quot;) and &quot;Tōsandō&quot; (&quot;eastern mountain route&quot;). During the Edo period, the name was changed to Nakasendō and was written as both 中山道 and 中仙道, but the Tokugawa shogunate established 中山道 as the official name in 1716.

== Today ==
Although much of the Nakasendō no longer exists in its historic form, its route is now roughly followed by modern roads. In order, they are:
*National Route 17: Tokyo to Takasaki (Gunma Prefecture)
*National Route 18: Takasaki to Karuizawa (Nagano Prefecture)
*National Route 142: Saku to Shimosuwa (Nagano Prefecture)
*National Route 20: Shimosuwa to Shiojiri (Nagano Prefecture)
*National Route 19: Shiojiri to Ena (Gifu Prefecture)
*National Route 21: Mitake (Gifu Prefecture) to Maibara (Shiga Prefecture)
*National Route 8: Maibara to Kusatsu (Shiga Prefecture)
*National Route 1: Kusatsu to Kyoto

Portions of the following railway lines approximately follow the path of the former Nakasendō: 
* Takasaki Line
* Shin&#x27;etsu Main Line
*Chūō Main Line
*Taita Line
*Tōkaidō Main Line

===National Historic Site===
Although there has been much modern development along the Nakasendō, a few stretches remain in its original form. Three sections in Nagano Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture have been accorded National Historic Site of Japan status by the central government in 1987. These include the section between Wada-shuku and Wada Pass, the section between Shiojiri-juku and Midono-juku, and the section between Tsumago-juku and Magome-juku. The most well-known section lies in the Kiso Valley, between Tsumago-juku and Magome-juku. The area was first made famous by the early 20th-century writer Shimazaki Tōson, who chronicled the effects of the Meiji Restoration on the valley in his landmark novel &quot;Before the Dawn&quot;. This eight-kilometer section of the Nakasendō can still be travelled along comfortably by foot, and both Tsumago-juku and Magome-juku have preserved and restored the traditional architecture. The walk between the historical post towns requires two to three hours to walk, with forests, restored paving and fine views of waterfalls along the way.

<text>The Great Falls Voyagers are an independent baseball team of the Pioneer League, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball (MLB) but is an MLB Partner League. They are located in Great Falls, Montana, and play their home games at Centene Stadium. 

The team has played continuously in the Pioneer League since 1969, and previously played in the league from 1948 to 1963. In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Pioneer League was converted from an MLB-affiliated Rookie Advanced league to an independent baseball league and granted status as an MLB Partner League, with Great Falls continuing as members. Prior to this, the Voyagers had been affiliated with the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers (1952–1963), San Francisco Giants (1969–1983), Los Angeles Dodgers (1984–2002), and Chicago White Sox (2003–2020). The team was not affiliated with any MLB team from 1964 to 1968.

==Voyagers==
The Voyagers name refers to the Mariana UFO incident in August 1950 when Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Mariana, the general manager of the Great Falls Electrics, saw two spinning objects approaching at a seemingly high speed. Mariana recorded 16 seconds of footage of the unidentified flying objects at Legion Park.

Under Rose Jr. the Voyagers held a 48-28 record and made it to the Pioneer League playoffs where they were eliminated by the Helena Brewers. On January 20, 2014, it was announced that then hitting coach Charlie Poe would manage the Voyagers for the 2014 season, ending Rose Jr.&#x27;s tenure as manager.

<doc id="341626" wikidata="Q3245432" url="?curid=341626" title="List of national memorials of the United States">
<text>National memorial is a designation in the United States for an officially recognized area that memorializes a historic person or event. the National Park Service (NPS), an agency of the Department of the Interior, owns and administers thirty-one memorials as official units and provides assistance for five more, known as affiliated areas, that are operated by other organizations. Congress has also designated twenty-two additional independently operated sites as national memorials. Another five memorials have been authorized and are in the planning stage. Memorials need not be located on a site directly related to the subject, and many, such as the Lincoln Memorial, do not have the word &quot;national&quot; in their titles. There is a degree of overlap in development of some areas designated as memorials, monuments, and historic sites, and their characterization is not always consistent with their names, such as whether the site is closely associated with whom it memorializes.

The earliest and perhaps most recognizable is the uniquely designated Washington Monument, which was completed in 1884 and transferred to the NPS in 1933. The most recently established is the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial, dedicated in 2020. The Pearl Harbor National Memorial was created out of the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument in 2019 and was previously just the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial. The NPS national memorials are in 15 states and the District of Columbia. Washington, D.C., has the most, twelve, followed by Pennsylvania and New York, each with three. The affiliated areas are in four states (two additional beyond those with NPS memorials) and the Northern Mariana Islands, while the other sites are in nine states (five additional), the District of Columbia, and Midway Atoll. Creation of new memorials in Washington, D.C. is governed by the Commemorative Works Act, while outside the District there are no systematic regulations.

Among the NPS national memorials and affiliated areas, ten celebrate US presidents, eleven recognize other historic figures, six commemorate wars, five memorialize disasters, and five represent early exploration. Eleven of the twenty-two non-NPS memorials commemorate wars or veterans, another ten represent groups of people who died for related reasons, and one relates to Native American history. Several major war memorials are located on or near the National Mall, contributing to the national identity. The historic areas within the National Park System are automatically listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

&quot;National Memorial&quot; is omitted below in the names of sites that include it; others may separate the two words or just use &quot;Memorial&quot;, and there is also one international memorial included. Private and other organizations may use the name &quot;national memorial&quot; (such as George Washington Masonic National Memorial and National Memorial for Peace and Justice) but they are not officially designated by the federal government, and are not listed here, as they are not created pursuant to the statutory scheme.

==National Park Service national memorials==
The National Park Service manages 31 national memorials as official units. It also oversees two more national memorials as part of other units, listed with the other national memorials. A few additional units, including Fort McHenry National Monument, include &quot;national memorial&quot; in their enabling legislation, but are not otherwise called that and are thus not listed here.
==Affiliated areas of the National Park Service==
The National Park Service provides technical or financial assistance to affiliated areas but does not own or administer them.
== Other national memorials ==
Congress has designated a number of sites as national memorials but not as units or affiliated areas of the National Park Service. While some are maintained by other federal agencies, most of these were created by local governments or private organizations which sought federal designation for wider and official recognition; the naming typically does not come with federal funding, but Congress has provided funds or allowed private fundraising for certain memorial sites. The Department of the Interior has noted that Congressional designation of private or local government sites as &quot;National&quot; may mislead the public into believing they are affiliated with the federal government. Congress has also authorized the construction of many memorials or commemorative works on federal land under the Commemorative Works Act, usually in Washington, D.C., or nearby; these are not listed unless specifically called a national memorial.
== Future national memorials ==
These memorials have been authorized by Congress but have not yet been constructed and established. Three would become NPS units if completed.

<text>Center Parcs Europe N.V. (formerly Center Parcs) is a European network of holiday villages that was founded in the Netherlands in 1968, and is currently operated by Pierre &amp; Vacances.

==History==


Dutch entrepreneur Piet Derksen started a sporting goods shop in 1953 at Lijnbaan, Rotterdam. Its name was &#x27;Sporthuis Centrum&#x27;, &#x27;Sport House Centre&#x27;. It succeeded and Derksen expanded into 17 outlets across the Netherlands, and then added camping articles to the range.

In 1968, Derksen purchased woodland near Reuver so staff and customers could relax in small tents. The park, , was successful, and the tents were quickly replaced by bungalows. In 1987, Center Parcs opened its first UK resort at Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire. This brought the company into the sights of expanding brewer Scottish and Newcastle, which later bought the group.

In 2001, the UK locations separated from the continental Europe locations and formed a separate company, Center Parcs UK.

In 2003, Scottish &amp; Newcastle sold the Continental European sites to a joint venture of Pierre &amp; Vacances (P&amp;V) and DBCP, a German investment group. This was given the name Center Parcs Europe (CPE). P&amp;V owned Europe&#x27;s largest (in terms of bed-count) bungalow-vacation-supplier, Gran Dorado Resorts, a Dutch former joint venture of Vendex, Algemeen Burgerlijk Pensioenfonds, GAK and Philips Rentefonds. P&amp;V brought Gran Dorado in the joint venture.

As CPE was based in Rotterdam, Netherlands, the Dutch and European Commercial Competition Authority did not approve of combining Gran Dorado and Center Parcs, as it would effectively control the European market. After agreeing to a reduction in beds owned, CPE sold all but six Gran Dorado Resorts to Dutch Landal GreenParks. The remaining six parks were added to CenterParcs: Loohorst (NL), Port Zelande (NL), Zandvoort (NL), Weerterbergen (NL), Hochsauerland (D) and Heilbachsee (D).

After the sale, five of the six remaining Gran Dorado Resorts parks were rebranded Sea Spirit from Center Parcs or Free Life from Center Parcs. The Weerterbergen-Resort was sold to Roompot because of the cost of bringing it to standard. All original Center Parcs resorts in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Germany were sub-branded CP Original. Having completed the integration and rebranding exercise, Pierre &amp; Vacances bought DBCP out of the partnership.

In January 2009, Sunparks launched alongside Center Parcs in Europe, as a low-cost brand. Many of the former Gran Dorado resorts were rebranded in this exercise, but the sub brand was dropped in 2011 and the parks were rebranded to Center Parcs.

==Operations and facilities==
There are now 26 resorts in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Germany. Most villages are different, but some villages such as Bispinger Heide in Germany and Domaine Les Bois Francs in France (and many more) share the same Village Plaza design. They have the same styled Aqua Mundo and Sports Plaza. Accommodation is in villas or bungalows, clustered in a park and surrounded by trees and bushes. An exception is Park Zandvoort, set among sand dunes. Certain resorts also provide hotel rooms. The first village had features that have stayed popular like the swimming pool, shops and restaurants. The first dome arrived in 1980, named Subtropical Swimming Paradise in UK resorts and Aqua Mundo in European resorts. A range of sporting activities is available, with restaurants, spas, saunas, and massage.

In 2009, Center Parcs Europe divided its parks into two brands: &quot;Center Parcs&quot;, which includes the 5-star parks, and &quot;Sunparks&quot;, which includes the 3- or 4-star parks. At the beginning of 2011 the company decided to rename most Sunparks as Center Parcs.

<text>A National Parkway is a designation for a protected area in the United States given to scenic roadways with a protected corridor of surrounding parkland. National Parkways often connect cultural or historic sites. The U.S. National Park Service manages the parkways.

==History==

===Parkways===

The first &quot;parkways&quot; in the United States were developed in the late 19th century by landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Beatrix Farrand as roads segregated for pedestrians, bicyclists, equestrians, and horse carriages, such as the Eastern Parkway and Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. The terminology &quot;parkway&quot; to define this type of road was coined by Calvert Vaux and Olmsted in their proposal to link city and suburban parks with &quot;pleasure roads.&quot; Newer roads such as the Bidwell and Lincoln Parkways in Buffalo, New York, were designed for automobiles and are broad and divided by large landscaped central medians. Parkways can be the approach to large urban parks, such as the Mystic Valley Parkway to Boston Common in Boston. Some separated express lanes from local lanes, though this was not always the case.

During the early 20th century, the meaning of the word was expanded to include controlled-access highways designed for recreational driving of automobiles with landscaping. These parkways originally provided scenic routes without at-grade intersections, very slow vehicles, or pedestrian traffic. Their success led to more development however, expanding a city&#x27;s boundaries, eventually limiting their recreational driving use. The Arroyo Seco Parkway between Downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena, California, is an example of lost pastoral aesthetics. It and others have become major commuting routes, while retaining the name parkway.

===National parkways===
In the 1930s, as part of the New Deal, the U.S. federal government constructed national parkways designed for recreational driving, and to commemorate historic trails and routes. As with other roads through national parks, these mostly undivided and two-lane parkways have lower speed limits, and are maintained by the National Park Service and the Federal Highway Administration jointly through the Federal Lands Transportation Program. An example is the Civilian Conservation Corps-built Blue Ridge Parkway in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and Virginia. Others are: Skyline Drive in Virginia; John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway in Wyoming, the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee; and the Colonial Parkway in eastern Virginia&#x27;s Historic Triangle area. The George Washington Memorial Parkway and the Clara Barton Parkway, running along the Potomac River near Washington, D.C., were also constructed during this era.

==List==
Four parkways are stand-alone units of the National Park System: Blue Ridge Parkway, George Washington Parkway, John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway, and Natchez Trace Parkway. Others are managed as part of another unit. 

The Great River Road was originally envisioned as a National Parkway.

<doc id="341639" wikidata="Q4930297" url="?curid=341639" title="Bluefield Blue Jays">
<text>The Bluefield Blue Jays were a minor league baseball team of the Rookie Appalachian League representing the twin cities of Bluefield, West Virginia, and Bluefield, Virginia. The team played their home games at Bowen Field at Peters Park, a historic stadium (opened in 1939) in Bluefield&#x27;s city park. The park, which straddles the West Virginia–Virginia state line, was operated by the West Virginia city; however, Bowen Field lies entirely within Virginia.

Upon the minor league reorganization in 2020, the team&#x27;s partnership with the Toronto Blue Jays ended and they became the Bluefield Ridge Runners.

==History==
On August 28, 2010, Andy MacPhail, then-president of baseball operations for the Baltimore Orioles announced that Baltimore was ending their affiliation with Bluefield and the Appalachian League, effective at the end of the 2010 Appalachian League season. Bluefield&#x27;s 53 season affiliation with the Orioles, which lasted from 1958 to 2010, had been the oldest continuous affiliation with the same major league franchise in Minor League Baseball.

The Orioles were sometimes known as the &quot;Baby Birds&quot; or the &quot;Baby O&#x27;s&quot;, a reference to their major league parent club. One of the best known players to have played in Bluefield is Cal Ripken Jr., who played with Bluefield in 1978 when he was 17 years old. Another famous former Baby Bird is Boog Powell, who played there in 1959, also as a 17-year-old.

Bluefield became an affiliate organization with Toronto for the 2011 season.

Outfielder Kevin Pillar played for the Bluefield Blue Jays in 2011, and batted .347, winning the Appalachian League batting title and leading the organization in batting average. He holds the team&#x27;s all-time records for batting average, on-base percentage (.377), and slugging percentage (.534). In August 2013, Pillar became the first Bluefield Blue Jays alumnus to play in the major leagues for Toronto.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball beginning with the 2021 season, the Appalachian League was reorganized as a collegiate summer baseball league, and the Blue Jays were replaced by a new franchise known as the Ridge Runners in the revamped league designed for rising college freshmen and sophomores.

<text>Coriander (), whose leaves are known as cilantro () in the U.S., is an annual herb (Coriandrum sativum) in the family Apiaceae.

Most people perceive the leaves as having a fresh, slightly citrus taste. Due to variations in the gene OR6A2, some people perceive it to have a soap-like taste, or even a pungent or rotten taste.

It is native to the Mediterranean Basin. All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds are the parts most traditionally used in cooking. It is used in certain cuisines, like Mexican and Southeast Asian.

== Description ==
It is a soft plant growing to tall. The leaves are variable in shape, broadly lobed at the base of the plant, and slender and feathery higher on the flowering stems.

The flowers are borne in small umbels, white or very pale pink, asymmetrical, with the petals pointing away from the centre of the umbel longer () than those pointing toward it (only long). The fruit is a globular, dry schizocarp in diameter. The pollen size is approximately .

=== Taste and smell ===
The essential oil from coriander leaves and seeds contains mixed polyphenols and terpenes, including linalool as the major constituent accounting for the aroma and flavour of coriander.

Different people may perceive the taste of coriander leaves differently. Those who enjoy it say it has a refreshing, lemony or lime-like flavour, while those who dislike it have a strong aversion to its pungent taste and smell, characterizing it as soapy or rotten. Studies also show variations in preference among different ethnic groups: 21% of East Asians, 17% of Caucasians, and 14% of people of African descent expressed a dislike for coriander, but among the groups where coriander is popular in their cuisine, only 7% of South Asians, 4% of Hispanics, and 3% of Middle Eastern subjects expressed a dislike.

About 80% of identical twins shared the same preference for the herb, but fraternal twins agreed only about half the time, strongly suggesting a genetic component to the preference. In a genetic survey of nearly 30,000 people, two genetic variants linked to the perception of coriander have been found, the most common of which is a gene involved in sensing smells. The gene OR6A2 lies within a cluster of olfactory-receptor genes, and encodes a receptor that is highly sensitive to aldehyde chemicals. Flavour chemists have found that the coriander aroma is created by a half-dozen substances, most of which are aldehydes. Those who dislike the taste are sensitive to the offending unsaturated aldehydes and, at the same time, may be unable to detect the aromatic chemicals that others find pleasant. Association between its taste and several other genes, including a bitter-taste receptor, have also been found.

=== Similar plants ===
* &quot;Eryngium foetidum&quot;, also a member of the Apiaceae, has a similar but more intense taste. Known as culantro and &quot;ngò gai&quot;, it is found in Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and South East Asia cuisine.
* &quot;Persicaria odorata&quot; is commonly called Vietnamese coriander, or &quot;rau răm&quot;. The leaves have a similar odour and flavour to coriander. It is a member of the Polygonaceae, or buckwheat family.
* &quot;Summer cilantro&quot; is one common name for &quot;Porophyllum ruderale&quot; subsp. &quot;macrocephalum&quot;, a member of the Asteraceae, the sunflower family. This species is found growing wild from Texas to Argentina.

== Etymology ==
First attested in English during the late 14th century, the word &quot;coriander&quot; derives from the Old French , which comes from Latin , in turn from Ancient Greek (or &#x27;), possibly derived from or related to &#x27; (a bed bug), and was given on account of its fetid, bug-like smell.

The earliest attested form of the word is the Mycenaean Greek (variants: , , ) written in Linear B syllabic script (reconstructed as &quot;&quot;, similar to the name of Minos&#x27; daughter Ariadne) which later evolved to &quot;koriannon&quot; or &quot;koriandron&quot;, and (German).

&quot;&quot; is the Spanish word for coriander, also deriving from &quot;coriandrum&quot;. It is the common term in US English for coriander leaves due to their extensive use in Mexican cuisine, but the seeds are referred to as &quot;coriander&quot; in American English.

==Origin ==
Coriander grows wild over a wide area of Western Asia and Southern Europe, making it difficult to define where the plant is native and where it was only recently established. Recent works suggest that wild coriander in Israel and Portugal might be an ancestor of cultivated coriander. They have low germination rates and a small vegetative appearance. Israeli coriander has an extremely hard fruit coat.

In Israel, fifteen desiccated mericarps were found in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B level (six to eight thousand years ago) of the Nahal Hemar Cave, and eleven from ~8,000–7,500 years ago in Pre-Pottery Neolithic C in Atlit-Yam. If these finds do belong to these archaeological layers, they are the oldest find of coriander in the world.

About of coriander mericarps were recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamen. As coriander does not grow wild in Egypt, this could be proof that coriander was cultivated by the ancient Egyptians. The Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian text dated around 1550 BCE, mentioned uses of coriander.

Coriander may have been cultivated in Greece since at least the second millennium BCE. One of the Linear B tablets recovered from Pylos refers to the species as being cultivated for the manufacture of perfumes. It was used in two forms: as a spice for its seeds and as an herb for the flavour of its leaves. This appears to be confirmed by archaeological evidence: the large quantities of coriander retrieved from an Early Bronze Age layer at Sitagroi in Macedonia could point to cultivation of the herb at that time.

== Allergies ==
Some people are allergic to coriander leaves or seeds, having symptoms similar to those of other food allergies. A cross-sectional study of 589 cases where food allergies to spices were suspected found 32% of pin-prick tests in children and 23% in adults were positive for coriander and other members of the family Apiaceae, including caraway, fennel, and celery. The allergic symptoms may be minor or life-threatening.

== Uses ==

=== Nutrition ===

Raw coriander leaves are 92% water, 4% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and less than 1% fat. The nutritional profile of coriander seeds is different from that of fresh stems or leaves. In a reference amount, leaves are particularly rich in vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin K, with moderate content of dietary minerals. Although seeds generally have lower vitamin content, they do provide significant amounts of dietary fiber, calcium, selenium, iron, magnesium, and manganese.

=== Culinary ===
All parts of the plant are edible. Fresh leaves and dried seeds are the most commonly used in cooking. Coriander roots are an important element of Thai cooking. Coriander is used in cuisines throughout the world.

==== Leaves ====
The leaves are variously referred to as coriander leaves, fresh coriander, Chinese parsley, or cilantro (US, commercially in Canada, and Spanish-speaking countries). The fresh leaves are an ingredient in many foods, such as chutneys and salads, salsa, guacamole, and as a widely used garnish for soup, fish, and meat. As heat diminishes their flavour, coriander leaves are often used raw or added to the dish immediately before serving. In Indian and Central Asian recipes, coriander leaves are used in large amounts and cooked until the flavour diminishes. The leaves spoil quickly when removed from the plant and lose their aroma when dried or frozen.
The taste of the leaves differs from that of the seeds. The seeds exhibit citrus overtones. The dominant flavorants in the leaves are the aldehydes 2-decenal and 2-dodecenal. The main flavorant in the seeds is (+)-linalool.

==== Seeds ====


The dry fruits are coriander seeds. The word &quot;coriander&quot; in food preparation may refer solely to these seeds (as a spice), rather than the plant. The seeds have a lemony citrus flavour when crushed due to the terpenes linalool (which comprises about two thirds of its volatile components) and pinene. It is described as warm, nutty, spicy, and orange-flavoured.

The variety &quot;C. sativum&quot; var&quot;. sativum&quot; has a fruit diameter of , while var. &quot;microcarpum&quot; fruits have a diameter of , and var. &quot;indicum&quot; has elongated fruits. Large-fruited types are grown mainly by tropical and subtropical countries, such as Morocco, India, and Australia, and contain a low volatile oil content (0.1–0.4%). They are used for grinding and blending purposes in the spice trade. Types with smaller fruit are produced in temperate regions and usually have a volatile oil content of around 0.4–1.8%, so they are highly valued as a raw material for the preparation of essential oil.

Coriander is commonly found both as whole dried seeds and in ground form. Roasting or heating the seeds in a dry pan heightens the flavour, aroma, and pungency. Ground coriander seed loses flavour quickly in storage and is best ground fresh. Coriander seed is a spice in &quot;garam masala&quot;, and Indian curries, which often employ the ground fruits in generous amounts together with cumin, acting as a thickener in a mixture called &quot;dhania jeera&quot;. Roasted coriander seeds, called &quot;dhania dal&quot;, are eaten as a snack.

Outside of Asia, coriander seed is used widely for pickling vegetables. In Germany and South Africa (see &quot;boerewors&quot;), the seeds are used while making sausages. In Russia and Central Europe, coriander seed is an occasional ingredient in rye bread (e.g. Borodinsky bread) as an alternative to caraway. The Zuni people of North America have adapted it into their cuisine, mixing the powdered seeds ground with chilli, using it as a condiment with meat, and eating leaves as a salad.
Coriander seeds are used in brewing certain styles of beer, particularly some Belgian wheat beers. The coriander seeds are used with orange peel to add a citrus character.

Coriander seeds are one of the key botanicals used to flavour gin.

One preliminary study showed coriander essential oil to inhibit Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

Coriander is listed as one of the original ingredients in the secret formula for Coca-Cola.

==== Roots ====
Coriander roots have a deeper, more intense flavour than the leaves and are used in a variety of Asian cuisines, particularly in Thai dishes such as soups or curry pastes.

== In culture ==
Coriander was mentioned by Hippocrates (around 400 BCE), as well as Dioscorides (65 CE).

<text>Luis Echeverría Álvarez (; 17 January 1922 – 8 July 2022) was a Mexican lawyer, academic, and politician affiliated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) who served as the 57th president of Mexico from 1970 to 1976. Previously, Echeverría was Secretary of the Interior from 1963 to 1969. He was the longest-lived president in Mexican history and the first to reach the age of 100.

Echeverría was a long-time CIA asset, known by the cryptonym, LITEMPO-8. His tenure as Secretary of the Interior during the Díaz Ordaz administration was marked by an increase in political repression. Dissident journalists, politicians, and activists were subjected to censorship, arbitrary arrests, torture, and extrajudicial killings. This culminated with the Tlatelolco massacre of 2 October 1968, which ruptured the Mexican student movement; Díaz Ordaz, Echeverría, and Secretary of Defense Marcelino Garcia Barragán have been considered as the intellectual authors of the massacre, in which hundreds of unarmed protestors were killed by the Mexican Army. The following year, Díaz Ordaz appointed Echeverría as his designated successor to the presidency, and he won in the 1970 general election.

Echeverría was one of the most high-profile presidents in Mexico&#x27;s post-war history; he attempted to become a leader of the so-called &quot;Third World&quot;, countries unaligned with the United States or the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He offered political asylum to Hortensia Bussi and other refugees of Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s dictatorship in Chile, established diplomatic relations and a close collaboration with the People&#x27;s Republic of China after visiting Beijing and meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, and tried to use Mao&#x27;s influence among Asian and African nations in an ultimately failed attempt to become Secretary-General of the United Nations. Echeverría strained relations with Israel (and American Jews) after supporting a UN resolution that condemned Zionism.

Domestically, Echeverría led the country during a period of significant economic growth, with the Mexican economy aided by high oil prices, and growing at a yearly rate of 6.1%. He aggressively promoted the development of infrastructure projects such as new maritime ports in Lázaro Cárdenas and Ciudad Madero. His presidency was also characterized by authoritarian methods including death flights, the 1971 Corpus Christi massacre against student protesters, the Dirty War against leftist dissent in the country (despite Echeverría adopting a left-populist rhetoric), and an economic crisis that occurred in Mexico near the end of his term due to a devaluation of the peso. In 2006, he was indicted and ordered under house arrest for his role in the Tlatelolco and Corpus Christi massacres, but the charges against him were dismissed in 2009.

Echeverría is one of the most controversial and least popular presidents in the history of Mexico. Supporters have praised his populist policies such as a more enthusiastic application of land redistribution than his predecessor Díaz Ordaz, expansion of social security, and instigating Mexico&#x27;s first environmental protection laws. Detractors have criticized institutional violence such as the Dirty War and Corpus Christi massacre, and his administration&#x27;s economic mismanagement and response to the financial crisis of 1976. His suspected role in the Tlatelolco Massacre prior to his presidency has also damaged his reputation. Numerous opinion polls and analyses have ranked him as one of the worst presidents in the modern history of Mexico.

==Early life==

Luis Echeverría Álvarez was born on 17 January 1922 in Mexico City to Rodolfo Echeverría Esparza and Catalina Álvarez Gayou. His paternal grandfather was Francisco de Paula Echeverría y Dorantes, a military doctor. He was the brother of actor Rodolfo Landa. He was of Basque descent. One of his childhood friends was José López Portillo, who would eventually succeed him as president of Mexico.

Echeverría met María Esther Zuno at the home of the artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, with whom they were friends. The couple&#x27;s social circle also included the artists David Alfaro Siqueiros and José Clemente Orozco. After a five-year engagement, Zuno and Echeverría, a law student at the time, were married on 2 January 1945. José López Portillo served as their witness.

Echeverría studied law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and obtained his degree in 1945. Echeverría joined the university&#x27;s faculty in 1947 and taught political theory and constitutional law.

==Early political career==
===Early PRI positions===
Echeverría joined the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1944. He eventually became the private secretary of the party president, , which allowed him to rise in the hierarchy of the party and acquire his first political offices.

===Secretary of the Interior===
Echeverría was Deputy Secretary of the Interior during Adolfo López Mateos&#x27;s presidency, with Gustavo Díaz Ordaz as Secretary of the Interior. After Díaz Ordaz left the Secretariat in November 1963 to become the presidential candidate of the PRI for the 1964 elections, Echeverría was appointed Secretary of the Interior to serve during the remainder of the López Mateos administration. Once Díaz Ordaz took office as president, he confirmed Echeverría as Secretary of the Interior, where he remained until November 1969. He was one of four ministers retained by Díaz Ordaz from López Mateos&#x27; cabinet.

====Tlatelolco====

Echeverría maintained a hard line against student protesters throughout 1968. Clashes between the government and protesters culminated in the Tlatelolco massacre in October 1968, a few days before the 1968 Summer Olympics were held in Mexico City.

===1970 presidential succession and campaign===
On 22 October 1969, Díaz Ordaz summoned Alfonso Martínez Domínguez—the PRI party president—and other party leaders to his office in Los Pinos to reveal Echeverría as his successor. Martínez Domínguez asked the president if he was sure of his decision and Díaz Ordaz replied, &quot;Why do you ask? It&#x27;s the most important decision of my life and I&#x27;ve thought it over well.&quot; On 8 November 1969, Echeverría was officially announced as the presidential candidate of the PRI. Although Echeverría was a hardliner in Díaz Ordaz&#x27;s administration and considered responsible for the Tlatelolco massacre, he became &quot;immediately obsessed with making people forget that he had ever done it.&quot;

During his campaign, Echeverría adopted populist rhetoric, personally campaigning in over 850 municipalities, and is believed to have been seen by around 10 million people of Mexico&#x27;s then-population of 48 million. He avoided criticizing Díaz Ordaz&#x27;s administration, and barely mentioned his main opponent, the PAN&#x27;s Efraín González Morfín. He also stated that his government would avoid attempting to curb Mexico&#x27;s population growth, which was expected to double in the coming decade, stating it was a personal matter, not the state&#x27;s. He defined himself as &quot;neither to the right, nor to the left, nor in a static center, but onward and upward.&quot;

Echeverría won the election with over 80% of the popular vote, as was entirely expected by international observers.

==Presidency (1970–1976)==
===Inauguration ===
Echeverría assumed the presidency on December 1, 1970.

===Domestic policy===

Echeverría was the first president born after the Mexican Revolution. Once inaugurated as president, he embarked on a massive program of populist political and economic reform, nationalizing the mining and electrical industries, redistributing private land in the states of Sinaloa and Sonora to peasants, imposing limits on foreign investment, and extending Mexico&#x27;s maritime Economic Exclusion Zone to 200 nautical miles (370 km). State spending on health, housing construction, education, and food subsidies was also significantly increased, and the percentage of the population covered by the social security system was doubled. 

Shortly after his term began, he issued an amnesty to all those arrested during the 1968 protests, which is believed to have been an attempt to disassociate himself with the massacre. The last 20 prisoners from the protests were released on December 20, 1971. He enraged the left because he did not bring the perpetrators of the 1971 Corpus Christi massacre to justice.

On 8 October 1974, Echeverría issued a decree creating the new states of Baja California Sur and Quintana Roo, which had previously been federal territories.

====Economic issues====
After decades of economic growth under his predecessors, the Echeverría administration oversaw an economic crisis during its final months, becoming the first in a series of governments that faced severe economic crises over the ensuing two decades.

During his period in office, the country&#x27;s external debt soared from US$6 billion in 1970 to US$20 billion in 1976. By 1976, for every dollar that Mexico received from exports, 31 cents had to be allocated to the payment of interest and amortizations on the external debt.

The balance of services, which traditionally had registered surpluses and had been used to partly finance the negative trade balance, entered into deficit for the first time in 1975 and 1976.

Despite this, the Mexican economy grew by 6.1%, and important infrastructure and public works projects were completed after stalling for decades.

Echeverría nationalized the barbasco industry during his tenure. Wild barbasco was the natural source of hormones that were the key component in the contraceptive pill. Nationalization and the creation of the state-run company PROQUIVEMEX came as the importance of Mexico to the industry was waning.

====Changes in the electoral system====
During Echeverría&#x27;s administration, a new Federal Election Law was approved which lowered the number of members a party needed to become officially registered from 75,000 to 65,000, introduced a permanent voting card, and
established the minimum age for candidacy for elected office at 21 (down from the previous age of 30).

Following PRI tradition, Echeverría handpicked his successor for the Presidency, and chose his Finance Minister and childhood friend, José López Portillo, to be the PRI&#x27;s presidential candidate for the 1976 elections. Due to a series of events and an internal conflict in the opposition party PAN, López Portillo was the only candidate in the Presidential election, which he won unopposed.

====Environmental policy====

The Echeverría government adopted the first national environmental law in 1971. Attention on the environmental impacts came from academics at the National Autonomous University, the National Polytechnic Institute, and the Colegio de México as well as interest in the 1969 U.S. National Environmental Policy Act. The government enacted a series of regulations to control atmospheric pollution, as well as issuing new quality standards for surface and coastal waters. As a structural matter, the government created a new agency to deal with the environment, which in later administrations became a full cabinet-level ministry.

====Dirty War and political violence====

The Echeverría administration was characterized by growing political violence:
*On one hand, several leftist guerrilla groups appeared throughout the country (the most important being those led by Lucio Cabañas and Genaro Vázquez in Guerrero, as well as the urban guerrilla Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre) in response to the government&#x27;s authoritarianism and the increasing social inequalities. The activities of these guerrilla groups mostly comprised kidnappings of prominent politicians and businessmen (two of the most famous cases included the kidnapping of José Guadalupe Zuno, who was Echeverría&#x27;s father-in-law, and the failed kidnapping attempt of Eugenio Garza Sada, which ended in his death) bank robberies and occasional attacks on garrisons. 
*And on the other hand, the Government itself violently repressed political dissent. In addition to the notorious 1971 Corpus Christi massacre, the Army was accused of widespread human rights violations (including executions) during the fight against the guerrilla groups. The aforementioned guerrilla leaders Cabañas and Vázquez, both of whom officially died in clashes with the army, are widely suspected of actually having been extrajudicially executed by the armed forces.

====Ban on rock music====
As a consequence of numerous student and youth protest movements during his administration, President Echeverría attempted to neutralize politicized youth. In late 1971, after the Corpus Christi massacre and the Avándaro Rock Festival, Echeverría famously issued a ban on almost every form of rock music recorded by Mexican bands. The ban (also known as &quot;Avandarazo&quot; because it was in response to the Avándaro Rock Festival, which had been criticized by the conservative sectors of the PRI) included forbidding the recording of most forms of rock music by national groups and the prohibition of its sales in retail stores, as well as forbidding live rock concerts and the airplay of rock songs. International rock music was initially not as affected by this ban, but after a 1975 concert at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City by the band Chicago ended with turbulence (due to oversold tickets) and police repression, president Echeverría issued a temporary ban on all concerts by American musicians in Mexico. The ban on domestic rock music lasted for many years, and it only began to be gradually lifted in the 1980s.

===Foreign policy===
Under the banner of &quot;tercermundismo&quot; (&quot;Third Worldism&quot;), a reorientation took place in Mexican foreign policy during Echeverría&#x27;s presidential term. He showed his solidarity with the developing nations and tried to establish Mexico as the defender of Third World interests. The aims of Echeverría&#x27;s foreign policy were to diversify Mexico&#x27;s economic links and to fight for a more equal and just international order.

He visited a total of 36 countries and had strong ties with the communist and socialist governments of Cuba and Chile respectively. Echeverría visited Cuba in 1975. Also, Mexico provided political asylum to many political refugees from South American countries who fled their country&#x27;s repressive military dictatorships; among them Hortensia Bussi, the widow of former Chilean President Salvador Allende. Moreover, he condemned Zionism and allowed the Palestine Liberation Organization to open an office in the capital.

Echeverría used his position as president to promote the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace, which was adopted by the 1975 World Conference on Women held in Mexico City. Also in 1975, the Mexican delegation to the United Nations voted in favour of General Assembly Resolution 3379, which equated Zionism with South Africa&#x27;s apartheid and condemned it as a form of racial discrimination. This resulted in a tourism boycott by the U.S. Jewish community against Mexico, which made visible internal and external conflicts of Echeverría&#x27;s politics.

Echeverría&#x27;s presidency rode a wave of anger by citizens in Northwestern Mexico against the United States for its use (and perceived misappropriation) of water from the Colorado River, which drains much of the American Southwest before crossing into Mexico. The established treaty between the U.S. and Mexico called for the U.S. to allow a specified volume of water, , to pass the U.S.-Mexican border, but it did not establish any quality levels. Throughout the 20th century, the United States, through its water policy managed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, had developed wide-ranging irrigation along the river, which had led to progressively higher levels of salinity in the water as it moved downstream. By the late 1960s, the high salinity of the water crossing into Mexico had resulted in the ruin of large tracts of the irrigated land along the lower Colorado.

===Failed campaign for United Nations Secretary-General===
In 1976, Echeverría sought to parlay his Third World credentials and relationship with the recently deceased Mao Zedong into becoming Secretary-General of the United Nations. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim of Austria was running for a second term in the 1976 Secretary-General selection. Although Secretaries-General usually run unopposed, the People&#x27;s Republic of China expressed dissatisfaction that a European headed an organization that had a Third World majority. On 18 October 1976, Echeverría entered the race against Waldheim. He was defeated by a large margin when the Security Council voted on 7 December 1976. 
The PRC did cast one symbolic Security Council veto against Waldheim in the first round, but voted in the Austrian&#x27;s favor in the second round. Echeverría received only 3 votes to Waldheim&#x27;s 14, with only Panama abstaining.

===1976 election, devaluation of the Peso and final stretch of his Presidency===

Echeverría designated José López Portillo, his finance minister and childhood friend, as the PRI&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 1976 general election and, in effect, as his successor in the presidency. The PRI unveiled López Portillo&#x27;s candidacy on 22 September 1975, choosing him over Porfirio Muñoz Ledo and Interior Minister Mario Moya Palencia. López Portillo and Echeverría were in the same age cohort, but López Portillo was not a practiced politician. He had been groomed from early on in Echeverría&#x27;s term to be his successor and had no power base himself, whereas Moya Palencia and Muñoz Ledo had the support of many senior PRI politicians and office holders, as well as independent power bases.

López Portillo ran unopposed, since the Popular Socialist Party (PPS) and the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PARM), both PRI satellite parties, supported his candidacy, while the right-wing National Action Party (PAN) was unable to nominate a presidential candidate due to internal conflicts.
The Mexican Communist Party (PCM) nominated Valentín Campa as its presidential candidate, but this party had no official registry and was barred from elections at the time, so Campa&#x27;s candidacy was not officially recognized and he ran as a write-in candidate.

In private, López Portillo&#x27;s aides expressed their hope that president Echeverría could become Secretary-General of the United Nations so that he would be out of the country for most of López Portillo&#x27;s term and therefore would be unable to try to influence the latter&#x27;s administration.

Shortly after the election, a couple of devaluations of the peso reflected the financial issues of the Echeverría administration, and his last months in office were marked by a general sense of economic malaise. Between 1954 and 1976, successive governments had maintained the value of the peso at 12.50 to the U.S. dollar. On 30 August 1976, as a result of the mounting economic problems, the Echeverría administration devalued the peso by 59.2%, leaving it with a value of 19.90 to the dollar. Two months later, the peso was devalued for a second time, now down to a rate of 26.60 to the dollar. Future President Miguel de la Madrid, who was then Subsecretary of Finance, stated in his autobiography that in those last months President Echeverría had an &quot;unstable&quot; mood and would sometimes fall asleep during cabinet meetings; De la Madrid also recounted that, at one of such meetings in that period, Fausto Loredo Zapata –then Subsecretary of the Presidency of the Republic– told Echeverría that he possessed a list of the forty most important men in Mexico and that it was necessary to &quot;declare war on them&quot; and arrest them that night, but Echeverría rejected the suggestion.

In this context, in October 1976 Echeverría made an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which accepted to give Mexico financial aid of up to 1,200 million dollars, and in exchange Mexico committed to correct the imbalances of its balance of payments and to follow an orthodox economic policy for the following three years, which included measures such as increases in public rates and taxes, as well as wage freezes. There is some controversy as to whether the President-elect López Portillo was informed of this agreement with the IMF, which was essentially dictating key aspects of his economic policy before he could take office, and it was reported that Julio Rodolfo Moctezuma, his first Minister of Finance, even denied the existence of such an agreement with the IMF shortly after he was appointed. In any case, on 23 December 1976 the López Portillo government ratified the agreement with the IMF after a heated debate with his cabinet.

==Post-presidency==
===Continued influence===
Echeverría imposed appointees on the new president, such as for governor of Baja California. López Portillo&#x27;s Minister of the Interior, Jesús Reyes Heroles, kept the president abreast of Echeverría&#x27;s overstepping boundaries, such as use of the presidential telephone network, visits to ministers, and meetings with political elites at his residence. Reyes Heroles took a series of steps to outflank Echeverría, including recording his conversations on the presidential telephone network and suggesting the replacement of officials supportive of Echeverría.

Echeverría was ambassador to Australia and New Zealand from 1978 to 1979.

Despite not keeping influence over López Portillo after their break, Echeverría continued to have some influence in Mexican politics. Miguel de la Madrid, president from 1982 to 1988, said in his autobiography that the idea for his 1987 Pact of Economic Solidarity [es] to contain inflation came from a suggestion made by Echeverría at a breakfast with him, during which the former president advised De la Madrid to invite the leading figures of the economic sectors to the National Palace so that they could talk to each other and agree on proposals to overcome the crisis.

After leaving office, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the president from 1988 to 1994, publicly accused Echeverría of inspiring the March 1994 murder of their party&#x27;s presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, and of leading a conspiracy against Salinas&#x27;s reformist allies in the party, which had led to a systemic political and economic crisis. Salinas claimed that Echeverría pressed him to replace the murdered candidate Colosio with an old-guard figure.

Echeverría&#x27;s brother-in-law, Rubén Zuno Arce, was convicted by a California court in 1992 and sentenced to life in prison for his role in the Guadalajara drug cartel and the murder of a U.S. federal agent seven years earlier. Echeverría repeatedly requested President Carlos Salinas to pressure Washington for Zuno Arce&#x27;s release, but to no avail.

After the defeat of the PRI in the general elections of July 2000, it emerged that Vicente Fox (the president from 2000 to 2006) had met privately with Echeverría at the latter&#x27;s home in Mexico City numerous times during his presidential campaign in 1999 and 2000.

Fox appointed several Echeverría loyalists to top positions in his government, including Adolfo Aguilar Zínser, who headed Echeverría&#x27;s &quot;Third World University&quot; in the 1970s, as national security advisor, and (Echeverría&#x27;s personal secretary) as ambassador to the United States. The most controversial was Alejandro Gertz Manero, who had been accused by the Mexican press of bearing responsibility for the suicide of a museum owner in 1972, as Gertz, then working for Echeverría&#x27;s attorney general, attempted to confiscate his private collection of pre-Hispanic artifacts (Echeverría also had a collection of such artifacts). Fox appointed Gertz as chief of the Federal Police.

===Charges===
In 2002, Echeverría was the first political official called to testify before the Mexican justice system for the Tlatelolco massacre of students in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco in 1968. On 23 July 2006, a special prosecutor indicted Echeverría and requested his arrest for allegedly ordering the attack that killed and wounded many student demonstrators during a protest in Mexico City over education funding on 10 June 1971. The incident became known as the Corpus Christi massacre for the feast day on which it took place, but also as the (&quot;Falcon Strike&quot;) since the special unit involved was called (&quot;The Falcons&quot;). The evidence against Echeverría appeared to be based on documents that allegedly show that he ordered the formation of special army units that committed the killings and that he had received regular updates about the episode and its aftermath from his chief of secret police. At the time, the government argued police forces and civilian demonstrators were attacked and people on both sides killed by armed civilians, who were convicted and later freed because of a general amnesty.

After the political transition of 2000, Echeverría was charged with genocide by the special prosecutor, an untested charge in the Mexican legal system, partly because the statute of limitations for charges of homicide had expired (charges of genocide under Mexican law have no statute of limitations since 2002). On 24 July 2004, a judge refused to issue an arrest warrant for Echeverría because of the statute of limitations, apparently rejecting the special prosecutor&#x27;s assertion of genocide-based special circumstances. The special prosecutor said that he would appeal the judge&#x27;s decision.

On 24 February 2005, the Supreme Court of Justice decided 4–1 that the statute of limitations (30 years) had expired by the time the prosecution began and that Mexico&#x27;s ratification by Congress in 2002 of the convention on 26 November 1968, signed by the president on 3 July 1969 but ratified by Congress on 10 December 2001 and coming into effect 90 days later, which states that genocide has no statute of limitations, could not be applied retroactively to Echeverría&#x27;s case since only Congress can make such agreements part of the legal system. 

While difficult to obtain a prosecution, the prosecution argued before the Supreme Court that political conditions prevented an earlier prosecution, the president was constitutionally protected against charges for his full term so the statute of limitations should be extended, and the UN convention accepted by Mexico covered past events of genocide.

The Supreme Court said that the law did not take into account political conditions and presidential immunity in calculating the statute of limitations, the prosecution failed to prove earlier charges against the defendants (producing only photocopies, with no legal value, of supposed legal proceedings from the late 1970s and early 1980s), and Article 14 of the Constitution bans retroactivity of laws.

On 20 September 2005, the special prosecutor for crimes of the past filed genocide charges against Echeverría for his responsibility, as interior minister at the time, on 2 October 1968 Tlatelolco massacre. Again, the assigned criminal judge dismissed the file and held that the statute of limitations had expired and that the massacre did not constitute genocide. An arrest warrant for Echeverría was issued by a Mexican court on 30 June 2006, but he was found not guilty of the charges on 8 July 2006. On 29 November 2006, he was charged with the massacres and ordered under house arrest by a Mexican judge.

Finally, on 26 March 2009, a federal court ordered Echeverría&#x27;s absolute freedom and dismissed the charge of genocide for the events of Tlatelolco.

==Personal life==
On 2 January 1945, Echeverría married María Esther Zuno, whom he was married to until her death in 1999, and they had eight children:
*Luis Vicente Echeverría Zuno (d. 2013), married to Rosa Luz Alegría
*María del Carmen Echeverría Zuno, an artist
* (1948-2020), an economist
*María Esther Echeverría Zuno, who has promoted her mother&#x27;s artwork
*Rodolfo Echeverría Zuno (d. 1983)
*Pablo Echeverría Zuno, an author at UNAM
*Benito Echeverría Zuno
*Adolfo Echeverría Zuno, a writer and teacher

Echeverría outlived three of his eight children. His son Rodolfo Echeverría Zuno drowned in a pool owned by his parents in 1983 due to embolism. Son Luis Vicente Echeverría Zuno died in Mexico City on March 13, 2013, after a failed heart operation. Son , an economist in the administration of Ernesto Zedillo, committed suicide on 19 May 2020, at age 71. As of 2019, he had 19 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.

His brother, actor Rodolfo Landa, died on February 14, 2004, in Cuernavaca.

==Later life and death==
On 15 January 2018, it was reported that he had died, but this was soon discounted. On 17 January, he celebrated his 96th birthday in a hospital and was discharged a day later. He was hospitalized again on 21 June 2018 and was discharged on 10 July.

Previously, the longest-lived Mexican president was Pedro Lascuráin, who died at age 96. By 2019, Echeverría, then aged 97, had passed Lascuráin&#x27;s record and became the longest-lived president of Mexico.

On April 21, 2021, Echeverria, aged 99, made his last public appearance at the Estadio Olímpico Universitario, where he received his second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Echeverría turned 100 on 17 January 2022, making him the longest-lived Mexican head of state. He died at his home in Cuernavaca on 8 July. He was cremated in a private memorial service held on 10 July.

==Legacy and public opinion==

Reporter Martin Walker notes that &quot;Echeverria is hated by Mexico&#x27;s left, who have sought to bring genocide charges against him as the minister of the interior responsible for the 1968 Olympic Games massacre of students and other protestors near downtown Mexico City. The Right in Mexico blames Echeverría for an economic disaster whose effects are still felt. When Echeverría took office, the Mexican peso was trading at just over 12 to the dollar and there was little foreign debt. He sharply increased indebtedness and eventually the peso collapsed to about one-thousandth of its 1970 exchange rate, wiping out the savings of the middle classes.&quot;

During his campaign and presidency, Echeverría adopted populist policies, attempting to portray himself as a &quot;man of the people&quot;, in a similar style to Lázaro Cárdenas. Cárdenas&#x27;s son, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, distinguishes Echeverría from his father by noting that after Echeverría left the presidency he was unable to retain much of the popularity that he developed. Historian Enrique Krauze speculates that Echeverría adopted populism to disassociate himself with the Tlatelolco massacre. Despite his efforts, Echeverría&#x27;s legacy remains rooted in the political violence of and the economic crash that occurred during his tenure. However, Echeverría did have some support, and was seen by many average Mexican citizens as more receptive to their needs, as during his campaign he personally took thousands of petitions and listened to the concerns of common workers.

Porfirio Muñoz Ledo, who was Secretary of Labor and President of the PRI under Echeverría, defended the latter&#x27;s administration and stated that Echeverría was very popular in the interior of the country, noting that the devaluation of the peso didn&#x27;t occur until after the elections, describing the salary of the workers as &quot;good&quot; and highlighting the effusiveness of the Workers&#x27; Day parade on 1 May 1976, when Echeverría came down from the balcony of the National Palace to greet the parading workers:
&quot;When have you ever seen again the President of the Republic standing alone in the street in front of the great waves of people who come and embrace him, including the independent unions, who paraded and at the end embraced him as well? So let&#x27;s not extrapolate. That his government was unpopular is a huge lie.&quot;

Several other members of the PRI, particularly older members, disliked and criticized Echeverría&#x27;s populist policies, including his predecessor Gustavo Díaz Ordaz. Díaz Ordaz once said of Echeverría, &quot;He is out of control. He doesn&#x27;t know what he is saying. He insists he&#x27;s going to make changes, but he doesn&#x27;t say to what end.&quot;

In a national survey conducted in 2012 about former presidents, 27% of the respondents considered that the Echeverría administration was &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, 16% responded that it was an &quot;average&quot; administration, and 46% responded that it was a &quot;very bad&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; administration. He was the second-worst rated former president in the survey, with only Carlos Salinas de Gortari receiving a lower approval rating.

<text>SAE International is a global professional association and standards organization based in Warrendale, Pennsylvania, United States. Formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers, the organization adopted its current name in 2006 to reflect both its international membership and the increased scope of its activities beyond automotive engineering and the automotive industry to include aerospace and other transport industries, as well as commercial vehicles including autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars, trucks, surface vessels, drones, and related technologies.

SAE International has over 138,000 global members. Membership is granted to individuals, rather than companies. Aside from its standardization efforts, SAE International also devotes resources to projects and programs in STEM education, professional certification, and collegiate design competitions.

==History==
In the early 1900s there were dozens of automobile manufacturers in the United States, and many more worldwide. Auto manufacturers and parts companies joined trade groups that promoted business. A desire to solve common technical design problems and develop engineering standards was emerging. Engineers in the automobile business expressed a desire to have &quot;free exchange of ideas&quot; to expand their technical knowledge base.

Two magazine publishers, Peter Heldt of &quot;The Horseless Age&quot;, and Horace Swetland of &quot;The Automobile&quot;, were advocates of the concepts for SAE. Heldt wrote an editorial in June 1902 in which he said, &quot;Now there is a noticeable tendency for automobile manufacturers to follow certain accepted lines of construction, technical questions constantly arise which seek a solution from the cooperation of the technical men connected with the industry. These questions could best be dealt with by a technical society. The field of activity for this society would be the purely technical side of automobiles.&quot;

Horace Swetland wrote on automotive engineering concerns and became an original SAE officer. About two years after Heldt&#x27;s editorial, the Society of Automobile Engineers was founded in New York City. Four officers and five managing officers volunteered. In 1905 Andrew L. Riker served as president, and Henry Ford served as the society&#x27;s first vice president. The initial membership was engineers with annual dues of US$10.

Over the first 10 years, SAE membership grew steadily, and the society added full-time staff and began to publish a technical journal and a comprehensive compilation of technical papers, previously called SAE Transactions, which still exist today in the form of SAE International&#x27;s Journals. By 1916 SAE had 1,800 members. At the annual meeting that year, representatives from the American Society of Aeronautic Engineers, the Society of Tractor Engineers, as well as representatives from the power boating industry made a pitch to SAE for oversight of technical standards in their industries. Aeronautics was a fledgling industry at that time. Early supporters of the concept of a society to represent aeronautical engineers were Thomas Edison, Glenn Curtiss, Glenn Martin, and Orville Wright.

Out of the meeting in 1916 came a new organization, to represent engineers in all types of mobility-related professions. SAE member Elmer Sperry created the term &quot;automotive&quot; from Greek autos (self), and Latin motivus (of motion) origins to represent any form of self-powered vehicle. The Society of Automobile Engineers became the Society of Automotive Engineers. 

Women joined the SAE in the 1920&#x27;s, with Marie Luhring becoming an associate member of the organization in 1920. Ethel H. Bailey became the first woman to become a full member of the SAE in 1926, having joined the staff as a research engineer in 1920.

Charles Kettering presided over SAE during World War I and saw membership pass the 5,000 mark. During this time, SAE emphasized the importance of developing member activity through local chapters – called &quot;Sections&quot;. After World War II, the Society established links with other standards bodies and automotive engineering societies worldwide, and since then has founded sections in countries including Brazil, India, China, Russia, Romania, and Egypt. By 1980, membership surpassed 35,000 and over the next two decades the society, like the industries and individuals it serves, became larger, more global, more diverse, and more electronic.

By the mid-1980s, membership edged close to 50,000; by the end of the 1990s, membership topped 80,000 with members in more than 80 countries.

As of 2017, the society serves over 138,000 global members, with more than a quarter from outside of North America.

==Timeline==
==Technical standards==
SAE International provides a forum for companies, government agencies, research institutions and consultants to devise technical standards and recommended practices for the design, construction, and characteristics of motor vehicle components. SAE documents do not carry any legal force, but are in some cases referenced by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Transport Canada.

===Aerospace industry standards===
SAE publishes technical documents for the aerospace industry. Aerospace Recommended Practices are recommendations for engineering practice, and Aerospace Information Reports contain general accepted engineering data and information.

===Levels of Autonomy===

SAE has proposed an influential categorization for &quot;levels of driving automation&quot; in vehicular automation. SAE J3016 defines six levels of automation for cars, ranging from level 0 (No Driving Automation) to level 5 (Full Automation), transitioning gradually from &quot;driver support features&quot; to &quot;automated driving features&quot;. This categorization scheme has also been adopted by the NHTSA.

==SAE units==
For historical legacy reasons, the label &quot;SAE&quot; is commonly used on tools and hardware in North America to indicate United States customary units measurements, that is, inch-based not metric (SI). Both this usage and casual use of the term &quot;Imperial&quot; are loose and imprecise (but common) references to inch fractional sizes and to the screw thread sizes of the Unified Thread Standard (UTS).

===Horsepower ratings===
SAE has long provided standards for rating automobile horsepower. Until 1971–1972 SAE gross power was used. Similar to brake horsepower (bhp), it gave generously unrealistic performance ratings. Since then, the standard has been the more conservative SAE net power, which takes into account engine accessory, emissions, and exhaust drags, but not transmission losses.

==Publications==
SAE International has been publishing technical information since 1906. Industry magazines published monthly include: &quot;Automotive Engineering International&quot;, &quot;Aerospace Engineering and Manufacturing&quot;, &quot;Off Highway Engineering&quot;, &quot;Truck &amp; Bus Engineering&quot;, &quot;SAE Vehicle Engineering&quot;, e-newsletters, Momentum magazine for student members, and various journals. SAE also produces the monthly &quot;Update&quot; newsletter for its members and publishes more than 100 books a year in print and electronic formats. Ranging from compilations on various technical subjects, to textbooks, to historical and enthusiast-oriented books, SAE&#x27;s titles cater to a variety of readers.

In April 2007, MIT canceled its subscription to SAE because of required digital rights management (DRM) technology implemented on SAE web-based database of technical papers. SAE International removed the DRM restrictions for colleges, universities, and other academic institutions.

==SAE Foundation==
In 1986, SAE International established the &quot;SAE Foundation&quot; to support science and technology education. One of the most pressing issues facing industry today is the decline of students enrolling in science and technology programs. This decline and its impact threaten the ability to meet future workforce demands. The SAE Foundation encourages and supports the development of skills related to mathematics, technology, engineering and science.

===STEM program===
&quot;A World In Motion&quot; is a teacher-administered, industry volunteer-assisted program that brings science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education to life in the classroom for students in Kindergarten through Grade 12. Benchmarked to the national standards, AWIM incorporates the laws of physics, motion, flight and electronics into age-appropriate hands on activities that reinforce classroom STEM curriculum.

===SAE Collegiate Design Series===
The &quot;SAE Collegiate Design Series&quot; provides an opportunity for college students to go beyond textbook theory and replicates the process of engineering design and manufacturing. In the CDS program, a company wants to sell a product for a specific market segment, for example a radio controlled airplane, a single seat off-road vehicle, or a single seat Formula style race car. Instead of doing all the design, manufacturing and testing in house, the customer chooses to contract out those processes to a supplier, and sends their requirements out for bid. Student teams act as the suppliers and design, build and test a prototype vehicle that they believe meets the customer&#x27;s specifications. Each team then presents its prototype to the customer at the annual competitions and is judged on several criteria. The team with the highest points essentially wins the contract.

The SAE Collegiate Design Series competitions include the following:
* SAE Aero Design – a series of competitive mechanical engineering events, it is generally divided into three categories: Regular class, Advanced class and Micro class.
* Baja SAE
* SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge
* Formula SAE
* Formula Hybrid
* SAE Supermileage
* SAE AutoDrive Challenge

<doc id="341653" wikidata="Q1857855" url="?curid=341653" title="Morris Lapidus">
<text>Morris Lapidus (November 25, 1902 – January 18, 2001) was an architect, primarily known for his Neo-baroque &quot;Miami Modern&quot; hotels constructed in the 1950s and 60s, which have since come to define that era&#x27;s resort-hotel style, synonymous with Miami and Miami Beach.

A Jewish Ukrainian immigrant based in New York, Lapidus designed over 1,000 buildings during a career spanning more than 50 years, much of it spent as an outsider to the American architectural establishment.

==Early life and career==
Born in Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine), his Orthodox Jewish family fled Russian pogroms to New York when he was an infant. As a young man, Lapidus explored acting which led to his interest in theatrical set design where he was directed by scene painters to study architecture. He attended Columbia University, graduating in 1927. Lapidus worked for the prominent Beaux Arts firm of Warren and Wetmore. At that time his first project was to design a garage ornament for the Vanderbilt mansion. His design incorporated Mercury, the god of Speed, into a modern sculpture. Lapidus explained that the proposed &quot;horse head and wagon was an anachronism.&quot; From 1929 to 1943 he worked with Ross-Frankel as a retail architect. When in early 1942 his father&#x27;s company, U.S. Metals, employed Morris to design a Signaling Search Light, which had been commissioned by Admiral Rickover, he resigned from Ross-Frankel, but not before showing Evan Frankel the potato fields of The Hamptons, where they went to successfully field test the light. 

After this very successful 22-year career in retail interior design with Ross-Frankel, Lapidus was asked to be a &quot;hotel doctor&quot; on several Miami Hotels. He soon was the associate architect of five hotel projects in Miami Beach—Sans Souci Hotel 1947 (opened 1949, after 1996 called the RIU Florida Beach Hotel), followed closely by the Nautilus 1950, the diLido (1951), the Biltmore Terrace (1951), and the Algiers (1951), all along Collins Avenue, and amounting to the single-handed redesign of an entire district. The hotels were an immediate popular success and Lapidus began to push the boundaries of the hotel experience further.

Then in 1952 he landed the job of the largest luxury hotel in Miami Beach, the property he is most associated with, the Fontainebleau Hotel, which was a 1,200 room hotel built by Ben Novack on the former Firestone estate, and perhaps the most famous hotel in the world. It was followed the next year by the equally successful Eden Roc Hotel, (where Harry Belafonte broke the &quot;color-line&quot; at the Beach by staying the night there), and the Americana (later the Sheraton Bal Harbour) in 1956. The Sheraton was demolished by implosion shortly after dawn on Sunday, November 18, 2007 and is now a W Hotel The St. Regis at Bal Harbor. Using these hotels as his &quot;laboratory for design&quot; and exploring &quot;how to sell a good time&quot; Lapidus became famous for his Miami Beach hotels: the Fontainebleau (1954), the Eden Roc (1955), and the Americana (the Bal Harbor Sheraton) (1956). The opening of the Fontainebleau was shown on TV. American&#x27;s watched as dancing people in ballroom upon ballroom streamed into their living rooms. In effect, Lapidus had out-palaced the palace and the modern era of the Miami Beach and her resort hotels began: everyone had to go.

In 1955, Lapidus designed the Ponce de Leon Shopping Center near the plaza in St. Augustine, Florida. The anchor store, Woolworth&#x27;s, was the scene of the first sit-in by black demonstrators from Florida Memorial College in March, 1960, and in 1963 by four young teenagers, who came to be known as the &quot;St. Augustine Four.&quot; The Woolworth&#x27;s door-handles and a Freedom Trail marker memorialize the events.

Lapidus later worked with Igor Polevitsky on the addition to the Shellborne Hotel where as with earlier hotels, of the big eight. At all early hotels he gave Miami Beach&#x27;s Collins Avenue its architectural style and made interesting nightscapes with his neon lettering; excelling with the Venetian lettering for &quot;diLido&quot;, the curving &quot;S&quot; at the Shellborne, or in the &quot;ER&quot; on the top rock at the Eden Roc. In the hotel interiors he anticipated post-modernism while serving up postcard views through modern glazing and decidedly modern exteriors. Lapidus&#x27;s modern tropical style, continued in the housing projects which he completed all the way up the coast on Collins Avenue from 44th to 94th; the Seacoast East and West and the condominiums at Haulover Beach mark sensuous bookends to the incredible sinuous ride on Florida&#x27;s Millionaire Row on the Atlantic Ocean.

The Lapidus style is idiosyncratic and immediately recognizable in photographs, derived as it was from his innovative and well-considered attention-getting techniques in his commercial store designs: sweeping curves, theatrically backlit floating ceilings, &#x27;beanpoles&#x27;, and the ameboid shapes that he called &#x27;woggles&#x27;, &#x27;cheeseholes&#x27;, as well his adept use of color, signage, lights, mirrors, techniques to &quot;float columns&quot;, float stairs and move people along meandering lines—as people do not walk in a straight line—are the vocabulary of his design style. His many smaller projects give Miami Beach&#x27;s Collins Avenue its style, including the interesting lettering styles in neon at the &quot;diLido&quot; and the Shellborne anticipating post-modernism. Beyond visual style, there is some degree of functionalism at work. His curving walls caught the prevailing ocean breezes in the era before central air-conditioning, and the sequence of his interior spaces was the result of careful attention to user experience: Lapidis heard complaints of endless featureless hotel corridors and when possible curved his hallways to avoid that effect.

The Fontainebleau was built on the site of the Harvey Firestone estate and defined the new Gold Coast of Miami Beach. The hotel provided locations for the 1960 Jerry Lewis film &quot;The Bellboy&quot;, a success for both Lewis and Lapidus, and the James Bond thriller &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964); Whitney Houston was filmed there in &quot;The Body Guard&quot; (1992) and Madonna shot her CD photos for her &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; 2005 album at the Eden Roc. The Fontainebleau&#x27;s most famous feature is the &#x27;Staircase to Nowhere&#x27; (formally called the &quot;floating staircase&quot;), which merely led to a mezzanine-level coat check and ladies&#x27; powder-room, but offered the opportunity to make a glittering descent into the hotel lobby. The planter under the stairway is all that is original today of the 1954 opening interiors.

My whole success is I&#x27;ve always been designing for people, first because I wanted to sell them merchandise. Then when I got into hotels, I had to rethink, what am I selling now? You&#x27;re selling a good time.

From 1993-until 2001, in the period before his death, Lapidus&#x27; style came back into focus. Deborah Desilets, architect and artist, was Morris Lapidus&#x27;s last collaborator. She first came into contact with Lapidus when she was the marketing director for Arquitectonica in 1993. By January 18, 1996, Desilets had left ARQ to found her own firm VVA INC, where she was able to work with Lapidus on a number of architectural projects, arrange his theoretical notes, stories and images for lectures, and explore product designs. Lapidus said, &quot;I went from the Fontainebleau to a fountain pen!&quot; In the same manner he helped with the Fontainebleau expansion by attending meetings with the Hilton and owner, Stephen H. Muss. Of the new design, Lapidus said that it was an &quot;Exclamation Point&quot; to his 1954 edifice and provide his prestige to help garner the new addition. Desilets and Lapidus were a team and this collaboration continued until his untimely death. Prior to this Lapidus bequeathed his name and legacy to Desilets&#x27;--in an unprecedented act in the annuals of architectural history—as a female collaborator. To secure his legacy, Desilets&#x27; gifted to Syracuse University Special Collections all the remaining Lapidus Papers; as Lapidus himself had sent papers to Syracuse in years prior. Following in his style, Desilets has produced furniture, rugs and mirrors with Dennis Miller and Associates, New York, NY from 2005 to 2018 under the Morris Lapidus trademark. Of the projects they collaborated on there were three projects for Roots of Canada; Roots, at The Promenade Mall Toronto, Roots in Bloomfield, IL and Roots in New York, NY. Of the several Miami projects, the first was for the ornament for a Spanish-Italianate style mansion on Sunset Island II; next the totally modern design in the colorfully, upbeat restaurant Aura at 603 Lincoln Road, on Miami Beach at the Lincoln Road Mall which appeared in the first color issue of the New York Times, Dec 23, 1999. Very soon after there was a total resurgence in Lapidus. He began to give lectures, make appearances and to make gifts of his vast collection of memorabilia: 100-150 year old books were donated to the School of Architecture at Florida International University, Miami, Florida new SOA campus was designed by Bernard Tschumi, Dean of Columbia; The Wolfsonian Museum, Miami Beach received slides of his design for the Distillery Building at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair; The Bass Museum received his living room furniture set; and Columbia received more papers. At numerous Miami Beach functions, Lapidus was honored for his help in the 1994-1996 renovation of Lincoln Road by Ben Wood of Wood and Thompson. Lapidus did not live to see a Frank Gehry, Saha Hadid or Herzog and De Meuron building, or Ray Jungle&#x27;s &quot;jungle on the mall&quot;, but his expression regarding Lincoln Road fits: &quot;Why be exotic in Private?&quot;.

Lapidus and Desilets appeared on CNN discussing a project for Ron Bloomberg on 21st Street; a very modern building that housed production staff for the Miami Beach Ballet (MBB), who had their new headquarters next to the Bloomberg site. The MBB Arquitectonica in their tropical modernism style. ( Of note is that Laurinda Spear interned with Lapidus in the 70&#x27;s and later introduced Desilets&#x27; to Lapidus while at a critique of the University of Miami student work at ARQ&#x27;s office. Desilets&#x27; worked at ARQ and established the computer lab and then became the Director of Marketing which she left to pursue her work with Lapidus.) Lapidus was also honored by the Society of Architectural Historians at a convention held at the Eden Roc hotel in 1998. Lapidus had a plaque erected in his honor on Lincoln Road at &quot;The Clam&quot; Bandshell at Euclid, quoting him &quot;A car never bought anything.&quot; At a lecture at Harvard Dean Silvetti asked, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Lapidus? That for 50 years his architecture was not published in magazines ...&quot;. In 2000, the Smithsonian&#x27;s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum honored Lapidus as an American Original for his lifetime of work, he was interviewed on Nov 14, 200 by Charlie Rose. During his last years he was accompanied and/or stood in for by Desilets&#x27; at lectures all over America; Cranbrook, Harvard, New York Architectural League, Corcoran Gallery, Columbia University, SOA Ruston, Austin, Texas, LA and others. Desilets continue this work to date.

After all this renewed interest, Lapidus was quoted saying, &quot;I never thought I would live to see the day when, suddenly, magazines are writing about me, newspapers are writing about me!&quot; And indeed the people—his client&#x27;s client—were clapping for him at the Cooper-Hewitt party when Lapidus exclaimed; debunking the Bauhaus&#x27;s &quot;form follows function&quot; with &quot;feelings find form.&quot;

==Personal==

Desilets&quot; authored Rizzoli&#x27;s &quot;Morris Lapidus: The Architecture of Joy&quot;, released in October 2010. Prior to that, Assouline published with Desilets three books: &quot;Morris Lapidus&quot; 2004; &quot;The Eden Roc 50th Anniversary&quot; 2005; and &quot;The DiLido&quot; 2006.

His son, architect Alan Lapidus, who worked with his father for 18 years, said, &quot;His theory was if you create the stage setting and it&#x27;s grand, everyone who enters will play their part.&quot;

In 2001, Morris Lapidus died from heart failure at the age of 98 at his Miami Beach apartment. Morris Lapidus&#x27; wife of 63 years, Beatrice, had died in 1992.

==Critical reception==
Lapidus designed 1,200 buildings, including 250 hotels worldwide. The American architectural establishment regarded Lapidus as an outsider, tried to ignore his work, then characterized it as gaudy kitsch. Ada Louise Huxtable, writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, said of the Americana, &quot;The effect on arrival was like being hit by an exploding gilded eggplant.&quot; This abusive critical reception perhaps culminated in a 1963 American Institute of Architects (AIA) meeting held at the Americana, where a variety of well-known architects including Paul Rudolph, Robert Anshen and Wallace Harrison took Lapidus to task for what they described as vulgarity, cheapness, and incompetence.

A 1970 Architectural League exhibit in New York began the serious appraisal of his work. Lapidus tried to ignore the critical panning, but it had an effect on his career and reputation. He burned 50 years&#x27; worth of his drawings when he retired in 1984 and remained personally bitter about some aspects of his career. Several unbuilt Lapidus hotels were donated to Desilets&#x27; by Don Seidler, who was Lapidus&#x27;s production man for more than thirty years. Lapidus&#x27;s unbuilt projects are the focus of Desilets&#x27; new book, &quot;Too Much To Be BUILT: Morris Lapidus&quot;. Lapidus was rediscovered in his autobiography &quot;Too Much is Never Enough&quot;, 1996, which is an answer to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s dictum &#x27;Less is more.&#x27; According to his German biographer Martina Duttmann, he has always been more highly regarded in Europe than in the U.S., where the comparable jet-set futurism is designated &quot;Googie&quot;. Today, books published by the AIA such as &quot;Architect&#x27;s Essentials of Starting a Design Firm&quot; 2003, refer positively to Morris Lapidus&#x27; works.

<doc id="341658" wikidata="Q309406" url="?curid=341658" title="Apathy">
<text>Apathy, also referred to as indifference, is a lack of feeling, emotion, interest, or concern about something. It is a state of indifference, or the suppression of emotions such as concern, excitement, motivation, or passion. An apathetic individual has an absence of interest in or concern about emotional, social, spiritual, philosophical, virtual, or physical life and the world. Apathy can also be defined as a person&#x27;s lack of goal orientation. Apathy falls in the less extreme spectrum of diminished motivation, with abulia in the middle and akinetic mutism being more extreme than both apathy and abulia.

The apathetic may lack a sense of purpose, worth, or meaning in their life. People with severe apathy tend to have a lower quality of life and are at a higher risk for mortality and early institutionalization. They may also exhibit insensibility or sluggishness. In positive psychology, apathy is described as a result of the individuals&#x27; feeling they do not possess the level of skill required to confront a challenge (i.e. &quot;flow&quot;). It may also be a result of perceiving no challenge at all (e.g., the challenge is irrelevant to them, or conversely, they have learned helplessness). Apathy is usually felt only in the short term, but sometimes it becomes a long-term or even lifelong state, often leading to deeper social and psychological issues.

Apathy should be distinguished from reduced affect display, which refers to reduced emotional expression but not necessarily reduced emotion.

Pathological apathy, characterized by extreme forms of apathy, is now known to occur in many different brain disorders, including neurodegenerative conditions often associated with dementia such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Although many patients with pathological apathy also have depression, several studies have shown that the two syndromes are dissociable: apathy can occur independent of depression and vice versa.

==Etymology==
Although the word &quot;apathy&quot; was first used in 1594 and is derived from the Greek (&quot;apatheia&quot;), from (&quot;apathēs&quot;, &quot;without feeling&quot; from &quot;a-&quot; (&quot;without, not&quot;) and &quot;pathos&quot; (&quot;emotion&quot;)), it is important not to confuse the two terms. Also meaning &quot;absence of passion,&quot; &quot;apathy&quot; or &quot;insensibility&quot; in Greek, the term &quot;apatheia&quot; was used by the Stoics to signify a (desirable) state of indifference toward events and things that lie outside one&#x27;s control (that is, according to their philosophy, all things exterior, one being only responsible for one&#x27;s own representations and judgments). In contrast to &quot;apathy&quot;, &quot;apatheia&quot; is considered a virtue, especially in Orthodox monasticism. In the Philokalia the word &quot;dispassion&quot; is used for &quot;apatheia&quot;, so as not to confuse it with &quot;apathy&quot;.

== History and other views ==
Christians have historically condemned apathy as a deficiency of love and devotion to God and his works. This interpretation of apathy is also referred to as Sloth and is listed among the Seven Deadly Sins. Clemens Alexandrinus used the term to draw to gnostic Christianity philosophers who aspired after virtue.

The modern concept of apathy became more well known after World War I, when it was one of the various forms of &quot;shell shock&quot;, now better known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Soldiers who lived in the trenches amidst the bombing and machine gun fire, and who saw the battlefields strewn with dead and maimed comrades, developed a sense of disconnected numbness and indifference to normal social interaction when they returned from combat.

In 1950, US novelist John Dos Passos wrote: &quot;Apathy is one of the characteristic responses of any living organism when it is subjected to stimuli too intense or too complicated to cope with. The cure for apathy is comprehension.&quot;

=== Social origin ===
There may be other factors contributing to a person&#x27;s apathy.

Apathy has been socially viewed as worse than things such as hate or anger. Not caring whatsoever, in the eyes of some, is even worse than having distaste for something. Author Leo Buscaglia is quoted as saying &quot;I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate-it&#x27;s apathy. It&#x27;s not giving a damn.&quot; Helen Keller stated that apathy is the &quot;worst of them all&quot; when it comes to the various evils in the world. French social commentator and political thinker Charles de Montesquieu stated that &quot;the tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy is not so dangerous to the public welfare as the apathy of a citizen in the democracy.&quot; As can be seen by these quotes and various others, the social implications of apathy are great. Many people believe that not caring at all can be worse for society than individuals who are overpowering or hateful.

===In the school system===
Apathy in students, especially those in high school, is a growing problem. It causes teachers to lower standards in order to try to engage their students. Apathy in schools is most easily recognized by students being unmotivated or, quite commonly, being motivated by outside factors. For example, when asked about their motivation for doing well in school, fifty percent of students cited outside sources such as &quot;college acceptance&quot; or &quot;good grades&quot;. On the contrary, only fourteen percent cited &quot;gaining an understanding of content knowledge or learning subject material&quot; as their motivation to do well in school. As a result of these outside sources, and not a genuine desire for knowledge, students often do the minimum amount of work necessary to get by in their classes. This then leads to average grades and test grades but no real grasping of knowledge. Many students cited that &quot;assignments/content was irrelevant or meaningless&quot; and that this was the cause of their apathetic attitudes toward their schooling, leading to teacher and parent frustration. Other causes of apathy in students include situations within their home life, media influences, peer influences, school struggles and failures. Some of the signs of apathetic students include declining grades, skipping classes, routine illness, and behavioral changes both in school and at home. In order to combat this, teachers have to be aware that students have different motivation profiles; i.e. they are motivated by different factors or stimuli.

===Bystander===
Also known as the bystander effect, bystander apathy occurs when, during an emergency, those standing by do nothing to help but instead stand by and watch. Sometimes this can be caused by one bystander observing other bystanders and imitating their behavior. If other people are not acting in a way that makes the situation seem like an emergency that needs attention, often other bystanders will act in the same way. The diffusion to responsibility can also be to blame for bystander apathy. The more people that are around in emergency situations, the more likely individuals are to think that someone else will help so they do not need to. This theory was popularized by social psychologists in response to the 1964 Kitty Genovese murder. The murder took place in New York and the victim, Genovese, was stabbed to death as bystanders reportedly stood by and did nothing to stop the situation or even call the police. Latané and Darley are the two psychologists who did research on this theory. They performed different experiments that placed people into situations where they had the opportunity to intervene or do nothing. The individuals in the experiment were either by themselves, with a stranger(s), with a friend, or with a confederate. The experiments ultimately led them to the conclusion that there are many social and situational factors that are behind whether a person will react in an emergency situation or simply remain apathetic to what is occurring.

==Measurement==
Several different questionnaires and clinical interview instruments have been used to measure pathological apathy or, more recently, apathy in healthy people.

===Apathy Evaluation Scale===
Developed by Robert Marin in 1991, the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) was the first method developed to measure apathy in clinical populations. Centered around evaluation, the scale can either be self-informed or other-informed. The three versions of the test include self, informant such as a family member, and clinician. The scale is based around questionnaires that ask about topics including interest, motivation, socialization, and how the individual spends their time. The individual or informant answers on a scale of &quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;slightly&quot;, &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;a lot&quot;. Each item on the evaluation is created with positive or negative syntax and deals with cognition, behavior, and emotion. Each item is then scored and, based on the score, the individual&#x27;s level of apathy can be evaluated.

===Apathy Motivation Index===
The Apathy Motivation Index (AMI) was developed to measure different dimensions of apathy in healthy people. Factor analysis identified three distinct axes of apathy: behavioural, social and emotional. The AMI has since been used to examine apathy in patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease who, overall, showed evidence of behavioural and social apathy, but not emotional apathy. Patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, subjective cognitive impairment and limbic encephalitis have also been assessed using the AMI, and their self-reports of apathy were compared with those of caregivers using the AMI caregiver scale.

===Dimensional Apathy Scale===
The Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) is a multidimensional apathy instrument for measuring subtypes of apathy in different clinical populations and healthy adults. It was developed using factor analysis, quantifying Executive apathy (lack of motivation for planning, organising and attention), Emotional apathy (emotional indifference, neutrality, flatness or blunting) and Initiation apathy (lack of motivation for self-generation of thought/action). There is a self-rated version of the DAS and an informant/carer-rated version of the DAS. Further a clinical brief DAS has also been developed. It has been validated for use in stroke, Huntington&#x27;s disease, motor neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, dementia, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and schizophrenia, showing to differentiate profiles of apathy subtypes between these conditions.

== Medical aspects ==

===Depression===

Mental health journalist and author John McManamy argues that although psychiatrists do not explicitly deal with the condition of apathy, it is a psychological problem for some depressed people, in which they get a sense that &quot;nothing matters&quot;, the &quot;lack of will to go on and the inability to care about the consequences&quot;. He describes depressed people who &quot;...cannot seem to make [themselves] do anything&quot;, who &quot;can&#x27;t complete anything&quot;, and who do not &quot;feel any excitement about seeing loved ones&quot;. He acknowledges that the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; does not discuss apathy.

In a &quot;Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences&quot; article from 1991, Robert Marin, MD, claimed that pathological apathy occurs due to brain damage or neuropsychiatric illnesses such as Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s, Huntington&#x27;s disease, or stroke. Marin argues that apathy is a syndrome associated with many different brain disorders. This has now been shown to be the case across a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions.

A review article by Robert van Reekum, MD, et al. from the University of Toronto in the &quot;Journal of Neuropsychiatry&quot; (2005) claimed that an obvious relationship between depression and apathy exists in some populations. However, although many patients with depression also have apathy, several studies have shown that apathy can occur independently of depression, and vice versa.

Apathy can be associated with depression, a manifestation of negative disorders in schizophrenia, or a symptom of various somatic and neurological disorders. Sometimes apathy and depression are viewed as the same thing, but actually take different forms depending on someone&#x27;s mental condition.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
Depending upon how it has been measured, apathy affects 19–88% percent of individuals with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (mean prevalence of 49% across different studies). It is a neuropsychiatric symptom associated with functional impairment. Brain imaging studies have demonstrated changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum in Alzheimer&#x27;s patients with apathy. Cholinesterase inhibitors, used as the first line of treatment for the cognitive symptoms associated with dementia, have also shown some modest benefit for behavior disturbances such as apathy. The effects of donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine have all been assessed but, overall, the findings have been inconsistent, and it is estimated that apathy in ~60% of Alzheimer&#x27;s patients does not respond to treatment with these drugs. Methylphenidate, a dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake blocker, has received increasing interest for the treatment of apathy. Management of apathetic symptoms using methylphenidate has shown promise in randomized placebo controlled trials of Alzheimer&#x27;s patients. A phase III multi-centered randomized placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate for the treatment of apathy has reported positive effects.

=== Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===
Overall, ~40% of Parkinson&#x27;s disease patients suffer from apathy, with prevalence rates varying from 16 to 62%, depending on the study. Apathy is increasingly recognized to be an important non-motor symptom in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. It has a significant negative impact on quality of life. In some patients, apathy can be improved by dopaminergic medication. There is also some evidence for a positive effect of cholinesterase inhibitors such as Rivastigmine on apathy. Diminished sensitivity to reward may be a key component of the syndrome in Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

=== Frontotemporal dementia ===
Pathological apathy is considered to be one of the diagnostic features of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, occurring in the majority of people with this condition. Both hypersensitivity to effort as well as blunting of sensitivity to reward may be components of behavioural apathy in frontotemporal dementia.

===Anxiety===
While apathy and anxiety may appear to be separate, and different, states of being, there are many ways that severe anxiety can cause apathy. First, the emotional fatigue that so often accompanies severe anxiety leads to one&#x27;s emotions being worn out, thus leading to apathy. Second, the low serotonin levels associated with anxiety often lead to less passion and interest in the activities in one&#x27;s life, which can be seen as apathy. Third, negative thinking and distractions associated with anxiety can ultimately lead to a decrease in one&#x27;s overall happiness which can then lead to an apathetic outlook about one&#x27;s life. Finally, the difficulty enjoying activities that individuals with anxiety often face can lead to them doing these activities much less often and can give them a sense of apathy about their lives. Even behavioral apathy may be found in individuals with anxiety in the form of them not wanting to make efforts to treat their anxiety.

=== Other ===
Often, apathy is felt after witnessing horrific acts, such as the killing or maiming of people during a war, e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder. It is also known to be a distinct psychiatric syndrome that is associated with many conditions, more prominently recognized in the elderly, some of which are: CADASIL syndrome, depression, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Chagas disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, dementia (and dementias such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia), Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome, excessive vitamin D, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, general fatigue, Huntington&#x27;s disease, Pick&#x27;s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), brain damage, schizophrenia, schizoid personality disorder, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, and others. Some medications and the heavy use of drugs such as opiates may bring apathy as a side effect.

<text>Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel (Augusta Wilhelmina Louisa; 25 July 1797 – 6 April 1889) was the wife of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, the tenth-born child, and seventh son, of George III of the United Kingdom and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The longest-lived daughter-in-law of George III, she was the maternal grandmother of Mary of Teck, wife of George V.

==Early life==
Princess and Landgravine Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, third daughter of Prince Frederick of Hesse-Kassel, and his wife, Princess Caroline of Nassau-Usingen, was born at Rumpenheim Castle (French: &quot;Château de Rumpenheim&quot;, German: &quot;Rumpenheimer Schloss&quot;), Offenbach am Main, Hesse. Through her father, she was a great-granddaughter of George II of Great Britain, her grandmother being George II&#x27;s daughter Mary. Her father&#x27;s older brother was the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. In 1803, her uncle&#x27;s title was raised to Elector of Hesse—whereby the entire Kassel branch of the Hesse dynasty gained an upward notch in hierarchy.

==Marriage==
On 7 May, in Kassel, and then, again, on 1 June 1818 at Buckingham Palace, Princess Augusta married her second cousin, the Duke of Cambridge, when she was 20 and he 44. Upon their marriage, Augusta became Duchess of Cambridge. They had three children.

From 1818 until the accession of Queen Victoria, and the separation of the British and Hanoverian crowns in 1837, the Duchess of Cambridge lived in Hanover, where the Duke served as viceroy on behalf of his brothers, George IV and William IV. Hanover had been liberated from French occupation in 1813 and the dynastic union with Britain restored.

In 1827 Augusta allowed that a new village, founded on 3 May 1827 and to be settled in the course of the cultivation and colonisation of the moorlands in the south of Bremervörde, would bear her name. On 19 June the administration of the Hanoveran High-Bailiwick of Stade informed the villagers that she had approved the chosen name Augustendorf for their municipality (since 1974 it is a component locality of Gnarrenburg). The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge returned to Great Britain, where they lived at Cambridge Cottage, Kew, and later at St. James&#x27;s Palace.

==Death==
The Duchess of Cambridge survived her husband by thirty-nine years, dying on 6 April 1889, at the age of ninety-one, at their home at Cambridge Cottage on Kew Green. Queen Victoria wrote of her aunt&#x27;s death: &quot;Very sad, though not for her. But she is the last of her generation, &amp; I have no longer anyone above me.&quot;

She was buried at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Kew, but her remains were transferred to St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle in 1930.

==Titles and styles==
* 25 July 1797 – 7 May 1818: &quot;Her Serene Highness&quot; Princess Augusta Wilhelmina Louisa of Hesse
* 7 May 1818 – 6 April 1889: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; The Duchess of Cambridge

==Issue==
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had three children:

<text>30 (thirty) is the natural number following 29 and preceding 31.

==In mathematics==

30 is an even, composite, and pronic number. With 2, 3, and 5 as its prime factors, it is a regular number and the first sphenic number, the smallest of the form , where is a prime greater than 3. It has an aliquot sum of 42; within an aliquot sequence of thirteen composite numbers (30, 42, 54, 66, 78, 90, 144, 259, 45, 33, 15, 9, 4, 3, 1, 0) to the Prime in the 3-aliquot tree. From 1 to the number 30, this is the longest Aliquot Sequence.

It is also:
* A semiperfect number, since adding some subsets of its divisors (e.g., 5, 10 and 15) equals 30.
* A primorial.
* A Harshad number in decimal.
* Divisible by the number of prime numbers (10) below it.
* The largest number such that all coprimes smaller than itself, except for 1, are prime.
* The sum of the first four squares, making it a square pyramidal number.
* The number of vertices in the Tutte–Coxeter graph.
* The measure of the central angle and exterior angle of a dodecagon, which is the petrie polygon of the 24-cell.
* The number of sides of a triacontagon, which in turn is the petrie polygon of the 120-cell and 600-cell.
* The number of edges of a dodecahedron and icosahedron, of vertices of an icosidodecahedron, and of faces of a rhombic triacontahedron.
* The sum of the number of elements of a 5-cell: 5 vertices, 10 edges, 10 faces, and 5 cells.
* The Coxeter number of &quot;E&quot;8.
* A largely composite number, as it has 8 divisors and no smaller number has more than 8 divisors

Furthermore,

In a group , such that formula_1, where does not divide , and has a subgroup of order formula_2, 30 is the only number less than 60 that is neither a prime nor of the aforementioned form. Therefore, 30 is the only candidate for the order of a simple group less than 60, in which one needs other methods to specifically reject to eventually deduce said order.

The SI prefix for 1030 is Quetta- (Q), and for 10−30 (i.e., the reciprocal of 1030) quecto (q). These numbers are the largest and smallest number to receive an SI prefix to date.

==In other fields==
Thirty is:
* Used (as –30–) to indicate the end of a newspaper (or broadcast) story, a copy editor&#x27;s typographical notation
* The number of days in the months April, June, September and November (and in unusual circumstances February—see February 30). Although the number of days in a month vary, 30 is used to estimate months elapsing.
* In years of marriage, the pearl wedding anniversary

==History and literature==
* Age 30 is when Jewish priests traditionally start their service (according to Numbers 4:3).
* One of the rallying cries of the 1960s student/youth protest movement was the slogan, &quot;Don&#x27;t trust anyone over thirty&quot;.
* In &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; the French existentialist Albert Camus comments that the age of thirty is a crucial period in the life of a man, for at that age he gains a new awareness of the meaning of time.

<text>Alvin Curran (born December 13, 1938) is an American composer, performer, improviser, sound artist, and writer. He was born in Providence, Rhode Island, and lives and works in Rome, Italy. He is the co-founder, with Frederic Rzewski and Richard Teitelbaum, of Musica Elettronica Viva, and a former student of Elliott Carter. Curran&#x27;s music often makes use of electronics and environmental found sounds. He was a professor of music at Mills College in California until 2006 and now teaches privately in Rome and sporadically at various institutions.

His works include solo performance pieces such as &quot;Endangered Species&quot;, &quot;TransDadaExpress&quot;, and &quot;Shofar&quot;; radio works such as &quot;Crystal Psalms&quot;, &quot;Un Altro Ferragosto&quot;, &quot;I Dreamt John Cage Yodeling at the Zurich Hauptbahnhof&quot;, and &quot;Living Room Music&quot;; large-scale musical choreographic works such as &quot;Oh Brass on the Grass Alas&quot;, for 300 amateur brass-band musicians, and the &quot;Maritime Rites&quot; series of performances on and near water; sound installation works such as &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;, &quot;Floor Plan&quot;, &quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;, and &quot;Gardening with John&quot;; chamber music such as &quot;For Cornelius&quot; for piano, the trio &quot;Schtyx&quot;, the string quartet &quot;VSTO&quot;, the saxophone quartet &quot;Electric Rags II&quot;, the percussion quartet &quot;THEME PARK&quot;, a series of works for chorus SATB, and the work for chamber orchestra and video &quot;Circus Maximus&quot;; &quot;The Book of Beginnings&quot; for orchestra, youth orchestra, self-playing pianos, and cellphone app; and many collaborative dance and theater works.

Since 1993, Curran has worked on &quot;Inner Cities&quot;, a growing series of solo piano pieces that together form one of the longest non-repetitive piano pieces ever written. Daniela Tortora has edited a book about his work, &quot;Alvin Curran Live in Roma&quot; (Die Schachtel 2010). In 2015 he published &quot;The Alvin Curran Fakebook&quot;, an atypical autobiography that includes photos, writings, and sketches alongside more than 200 scores and fragments ranging from raw sonic materials to conceptual musics and completed compositions. His articles have been published in the New York Times, Leonardo, The Contemporary Music Review, and Musiktexte, among others.

<text>40 (forty) is the natural number following 39 and preceding 41.

Though the word is related to &quot;four&quot; (4), the spelling &quot;forty&quot; replaced &quot;fourty&quot; during the 17th century and is now the standard form.

== Mathematics ==
40 is an abundant number.

Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler noted 40 prime numbers generated by the quadratic polynomial formula_1, with values formula_2. These forty prime numbers are the same prime numbers that are generated using the polynomial formula_3 with values of formula_4 from 1 through 40, and are also known in this context as &quot;Euler&#x27;s &quot;lucky&quot; numbers&quot;.

Forty is the only integer whose English name has its letters in alphabetical order.

== In religion ==
The number 40 is found in many traditions without any universal explanation for its use. In Jewish, Christian, Islamic, and other Middle Eastern traditions it is taken to represent a large, approximate number, similar to &quot;umpteen&quot;.

=== Sumerian ===
Enki ( /ˈɛŋki/) or Enkil (Sumerian: dEN.KI(G)𒂗𒆠) is a god in Sumerian mythology, later known as Ea in Akkadian and Babylonian mythology. He was originally patron god of the city of Eridu, but later the influence of his cult spread throughout Mesopotamia and to the Canaanites, Hittites and Hurrians. He was the deity of crafts (gašam); mischief; water, seawater, lake water (a, aba, ab), intelligence (gestú, literally &quot;ear&quot;) and creation (Nudimmud: nu, likeness, dim mud, make bear). He was associated with the southern band of constellations called stars of Ea, but also with the constellation AŠ-IKU, the Field (Square of Pegasus). Beginning around the second millennium BCE, he was sometimes referred to in writing by the numeric ideogram for &quot;40&quot;, occasionally referred to as his &quot;sacred number&quot;.

=== Judaism ===
* In the Hebrew Bible, forty is often used for time periods, forty days or forty years, which separate &quot;two distinct epochs&quot;.
* Rain fell for &quot;forty days and forty nights&quot; during the Flood (Genesis 7:4).
* Noah waited for forty days after the tops of mountains were seen after the flood, before releasing a raven (Genesis 8:5–7).
* Spies were sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan (promised to the children of Israel) for &quot;forty days&quot; (Numbers 13:2, 25).
* The Hebrew people lived in the lands outside of the promised land for &quot;forty years&quot;. This period of years represents the time it takes for a new generation to arise (Numbers 32:13).
* Several early Hebrew leaders and kings are said to have ruled for &quot;forty years&quot;, that is, a generation. Examples include Eli (1 Samuel 4:18), Saul (Acts 13:21), David (2 Samuel 5:4), and Solomon (1 Kings 11:42).
* Goliath challenged the Israelites twice a day for forty days before David defeated him (1 Samuel 17:16).
* Moses spent three consecutive periods of &quot;forty days and forty nights&quot; on Mount Sinai:
# He went up on the seventh day of Sivan, after God gave the Torah to the Jewish people, in order to learn the Torah from God, and came down on the seventeenth day of Tammuz, when he saw the Jews worshiping the Golden Calf and broke the tablets (Deuteronomy 9:11).
# He went up on the eighteenth day of Tammuz to beg forgiveness for the people&#x27;s sin and came down without God&#x27;s atonement on the twenty-ninth day of Av (Deuteronomy 9:25).
# He went up on the first day of Elul and came down on the tenth day of Tishrei, the first Yom Kippur, with God&#x27;s atonement (Deuteronomy 10:10).
* A mikvah consists of 40 &quot;se&#x27;ah&quot; (approximately ) of water
* The prophet Elijah had to walk 40 days and 40 nights before arriving at mount Horeb (1 Kings 19:8).
* 40 lashes is one of the punishments meted out by the Sanhedrin (Deuteronomy 25:3), though in actual practice only 39 lashes were administered.
* (Numbers 14:33–34) alludes to the same with ties to the prophecy in The Book of Daniel. &quot;For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have Me against you.&quot;
* One of the prerequisites for a man to study Kabbalah is that he is forty years old.
* &quot;The registering of these men was carried on cruelly, zealously, assiduously, from the rising of the sun to its going down, and was not brought to an end in forty days&quot; (3 Maccabees 4:15).
* Jonah warns Nineveh that &quot;Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&quot; (Jonah 3:4)

=== Islam ===
* Prophet Muhammad was forty years old when he first received the revelation delivered by the archangel Gabriel. The Quran states that a person reaches the age of maturity at 40.

=== Hinduism ===
In Hinduism, some popular religious prayers consist of forty shlokas or dohas (couplets, stanzas). The most common being the Hanuman Chalisa (&quot;chaalis&quot; is the Hindi term for 40).

In the Hindu system some of the popular fasting periods consist 40 days and is called the period One &#x27;Mandala Kalam&#x27; Kalam means a period and Mandala Kalam means a period of 40 days. For example, the devotees (male and female) of Swami Ayyappa, the name of a Hindu god very popular in Kerala, India (Sabarimala Swami Ayyappan) strictly observed forty days fasting and visit (since female devotees of a certain biological age group would not be able to perform the continuous 40-day-austerities, they would not enter into the god&#x27;s temple until September 2018) with their holy submission or offerings on 41st or a convenient day after a minimum 40 days practice of fasting. The offering is called &quot;Kaanikka&quot;.

<text>The Anna Nicole Show is an American reality sitcom starring former model and Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith. The series debuted on August 4, 2002 on E! and ran for two seasons and four one hour specials. The first season was the most watched show on the network.

==Synopsis==
The show follows the exploits of Anna Nicole Smith and her entourage; much of the focus of the series was on the fact that Smith had gained weight after falling out of the public eye, no longer received regular modeling or acting work, and, at the time of the series&#x27; debut, was in a precarious financial state after lavish spending sprees and the battle against her stepson for her deceased husband&#x27;s fortune. Story arcs included Smith&#x27;s alleged period of unwilling celibacy (which Smith referred to as &quot;the dry spell&quot;); her struggle to cure her miniature poodle&#x27;s habit of attempting intercourse with inanimate objects; her love-hate relationship with her toothless, redneck cousin; and her &quot;fashion feud&quot; with interior decorator Bobby Trendy.

Although termed a reality show, many, if not all, of the episodes began with situations contrived by the producers (i.e., Smith goes to a dating service; Smith participates in a game show based on &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;); the show was a &quot;reality show,&quot; however, to the degree that Smith&#x27;s and the other individuals&#x27; interactions and reactions to the events occurring around them were unscripted.

==Additional cast==
In addition to Smith, the show also featured:

*Kim Walther &quot;Kimmy/Kimmie&quot; – Smith&#x27;s personal assistant. She claimed to be Smith&#x27;s biggest fan and admirer, insisting that she saw the &quot;inner beauty&quot; of Smith, which led her to getting a large tattoo of Smith on her shoulder and upper arm. Kimmie&#x27;s ambiguous sexual orientation and the possibility of a lesbian relationship with Smith surfaced in several episodes.
*Howard K. Stern – Smith&#x27;s attorney, frequently portrayed as a cold, calculating mind who serves as Smith&#x27;s right-hand-man; he frequently assumes the role of stooge. Stern&#x27;s antagonistic relationship with interior decorator Bobby Trendy was a recurring plot line throughout most of the series.
*Daniel Smith – Smith&#x27;s teenage son. Though listed in the show&#x27;s opening credits, his appearances were infrequent, and he often appeared to be somewhat camera shy. In his rare appearances, he was portrayed as something of a foil to his mother&#x27;s raunchy behavior.
*Sugar Pie – Smith&#x27;s miniature poodle. The dog&#x27;s tendency to attempt to have intercourse with various inanimate objects was a running gag on the show. In the first season of the show Smith attempted to cure Sugar Pie of her habits by hiring a pet psychic.
*Bobby Trendy – A flamboyantly gay interior decorator, the quality of whose work and timeliness, or lack thereof, displeased Smith, resulting in an elongated feud which served as the show&#x27;s major ongoing plot line; he was somewhat the show&#x27;s primary antagonist. He was prone to making self-congratulatory bon mots about his own taste in fashion and clothing accessories and frequently went out of the way in the middle of conversation to list the brand names of the articles of clothing he was wearing. Had something of a catchphrase in uttering the word &quot;luxurious&quot; in reference to himself or activities in which he participated.
*Shelly Cloud – Anna Nicole Smith&#x27;s cousin; &quot;Cousin Shelly&quot; is portrayed as Smith&#x27;s opposite. She never left the small town in which she grew up and is now an impoverished housewife with no teeth. Shelly frequently arrives on Smith&#x27;s doorstep without notice to request financial assistance or otherwise attempt to exploit their relationship for financial gain, though she insists it&#x27;s because they were close as children and that she misses her cousin. Next to Bobby Trendy, she is the show&#x27;s second most notable &quot;antagonist.&quot; In the series finale, Shelly reveals that she plans to force herself and her husband into Smith&#x27;s life permanently by moving into her house with or without permission. In a way its implied that Anna doesn&#x27;t care for her at times because she seems to be a reminder of what her life could have been like and what she could have turned into if she had never left Mexia, Texas.
*Benjy Bronk – Benjy from &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; went on two dates with Smith after her appearance on the Stern show. According to Smith, they &quot;...had a drink, and the next thing I knew, my head was in Benjy&#x27;s lap and I loved it...&quot;

<doc id="341681" wikidata="Q7843247" url="?curid=341681" title="Tripartite System of education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland">
<text>The Tripartite System was the selective school system of state-funded secondary education between 1945 and the 1970s in England and Wales, and from 1947 to 2009 in Northern Ireland. It was an administrative implementation of the Education Act 1944 and the Education Act (Northern Ireland) 1947. The tripartite system is not mentioned in either Act, this model was a consensus of both major political parties based on the 1938 Spens Report.

State-funded secondary education was to be structured as three types of school: grammar school; secondary technical school (sometimes described as &quot;technical grammar&quot; or &quot;technical high&quot; school); secondary modern school. Not all education authorities implemented the tripartite system; many maintained only two types of secondary school, the grammar and the secondary modern.

Pupils were allocated to their respective types of school according to their performance in the 11-plus or the 13-plus examination. It was the prevalent system under the Conservative governments of the 1951 to 1964 period, but was actively discouraged by the Labour government after 1965. It was formally abolished in England and Wales in 1976, giving way to the comprehensive system. However, elements of similar systems persist in several English counties such as Kent and Lincolnshire, which maintain the grammar schools alongside other less academic non-selective secondary schools. The system&#x27;s merits and demerits, in particular the need and selection for grammar schools, were contentious issues at the time and remain so.

==A new design for secondary education==
===Origins===
Prior to 1944 the British secondary education system was fundamentally an &quot;ad hoc&quot; creation. Access was not universally available, and varied greatly by region. Schools had been created by local government, private charity and religious foundations. Education was often a serious drain on family resources, and subsidies for school expenses were sporadic. Secondary education was mainly the preserve of the middle classes, and in 1938 only 13% of working class 13-year-olds were still in school.

Many of the schools created since the 1870s were grammar schools, which offered places based on an entrance test. Places were highly desired and seen as offering a great chance at success. These schools were widely admired, and were to become a model for the tier-structured education reforms of the 1940s.

There was also a strong belief in the value and accuracy of psychometric testing. Many in the educational establishment, particularly the psychologist Sir Cyril Burt, argued that testing students was a valid way of assessing their suitability for various types of education. Similar conclusions were drawn in a number of other countries, including France, Italy, Germany and Sweden, all of which operated a state-run system of selective schools.

The 1926 Hadow Report had recommended that the education system be formally split into separate stages at the age of eleven or twelve. Before this point there had been no formal demarcation between primary and secondary education as known in modern society. The creation of this break would encourage the establishment of selection at the point when pupils were changing schools. The Spens Report of 1938 recommended the tripartite system viz. grammar, technical high and &#x27;modern&#x27; secondary schools. This was the basis of the post 1944 reform.

===The Butler Act===
The 1944 Butler Education Act radically overhauled education in England and Wales, and the Education (Northern Ireland) Act 1947 set out a similar restructuring for Northern Ireland. For the first time, secondary education was to become a right, and was to be universally provided. It would also be free, with financial assistance for poor students. This was part of the major shake-up of government welfare in the wake of the 1942 Beveridge Report.

In addition to promising universal secondary education, the act intended to improve the kind of education provided. Children would be provided with the type of education which most suited their needs and abilities. Calling their creation the Tripartite System, education officials envisaged a radical technocratic system in which skill was the major factor in deciding access to education, rather than financial resources. It would meet the needs of the economy, providing intellectuals, technicians and general workers, each with the required training.

The Act was created in the abstract, making the resultant system more idealistic than practical. In particular, it assumed that adequate resources would be allocated to implement the system fully.

===Design of the system===
The basic assumption of the Tripartite system was that all students, regardless of background, should be entitled to an education appropriate to their needs and abilities. It was also assumed that students with different abilities were suited to different curricula. It was believed that an IQ test was a legitimate way of determining a child&#x27;s suitability to a particular tier.

There would be three categories of state-run secondary schools. Each was designed with a specific purpose in mind, aiming to impart a range of skills appropriate to the needs and future careers of their pupils.

*Grammar schools were intended to teach a highly academic curriculum, teaching students to deal with abstract concepts. There was a strong focus on intellectual subjects, such as literature, classics and complex mathematics. As well as wholly state-funded grammar schools, schools that received state grants could become direct grant grammar schools, with some pupils funded by the state, the rest paying fees.
*Secondary technical schools were designed to train children adept in mechanical and scientific subjects. The focus of the schools was on providing high academic standards in demanding subjects such as physics, chemistry, advanced mathematics and biology to create pupils that could become scientists, engineers and technicians.
*Secondary modern schools (secondary intermediate schools in Northern Ireland) would mainly train pupils in practical skills, aimed at equipping them for less skilled jobs and home management. Many secondary modern schools, however, offered academic streams to achieve CSE and GCE Ordinary Level qualifications in mainstream subject areas (Mathematics, English Language and Literature, History, Geography, Science etc.)

It was intended for all three branches of the system to have a parity of esteem. The appropriate type of school for each student would be determined by their performance in an examination taken in the final year of primary school.

==The system in operation==
===Implementation===
The Tripartite System was arguably the least politically controversial of the great post-war welfare reforms. The Butler Act had been written by a Conservative, and had received the full backing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

Many in the Labour party, meanwhile, were enthusiastic about the ability of the Tripartite System to enable social mobility. A first-rate education would now be available to any capable child, not simply a rich one. The tripartite system seemed an excellent tool with which to erode class barriers.

In spite of this broad approval, the resources for implementing the system were slow in coming. The logistical difficulties of building enough secondary schools for the entire country delayed the introduction of tripartite education. It was not until 1951, and the election of a Conservative government, that the system began to be widely implemented. Some historians have argued that tripartite education was the Conservative answer to the attractions of the Welfare state, replacing collective benefits with individual opportunities. Even so, there was still a dramatic shortfall in resources for the new education system.

Very few technical schools were opened, due to the lack of money and a shortage of suitably qualified teachers. This failure to develop the technical part of the system undermined the whole structure. The tripartite system was, in effect, a two-tier system with grammar schools for the academically gifted and secondary modern schools for the others.

Grammar schools received the lion&#x27;s share of the money, reinforcing their image as the best part of the system, and places in grammar schools were highly sought after. Around 25% of children went to a grammar school, although there was a severe regional imbalance, with many more grammar school places available in the South than in the North, and with fewer places available for girls. This was partly the result of a historical neglect of education in the north of England, which the tripartite system did much to correct. Nevertheless, in 1963 there were grammar school places for 33% of the children in Wales and only 22% of children in the Eastern region.

Secondary modern schools were correspondingly neglected, giving them the appearance of being &#x27;sink schools&#x27;. Although explicitly not presented as such, the secondary modern was widely perceived as the bottom tier of the tripartite system. They suffered from underinvestment and poor reputations, in spite of educating around 70% of the UK&#x27;s school children. The Newsom Report of 1963, looking at the education of average and below average children, found that secondary moderns in slum areas of London left fifteen-year-olds sitting on primary school furniture and faced teachers changing as often as once a term.

Existing beliefs about education and the failure to develop the technical schools led to the grammar schools being perceived as superior to the alternatives. The system failed to take into account the public perception of the different tiers. Whilst officially no tier was seen as better than the other, it was a generally held belief amongst the general public that the grammar schools were the best schools available, and entry into the other two types was considered a &quot;failure&quot;.

Alongside this system existed a number of public schools and other fee-paying educational establishments. These organised their own intakes, and were not tied to the curricula of any of the above schools. In practice, most of these were educationally similar to grammar schools but with a full ability range amongst their pupils.

===The 11-plus===
To allocate students between the three tiers, many students sat an exam during their final year at primary school; at the age of 10 or 11 years, depending on when their birthday fell. In some areas e.g. Wisbech, Isle of Ely the test was two years later (i.e. a Thirteen-Plus to enter Wisbech Grammar School). Three tests were given; one tested mathematical ability, one set an essay on a general topic and a third examined general reasoning.

Originally, these tests were intended to decide which school would be best suited to a child&#x27;s needs – officially there was no &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;fail&quot; – the result determined which of the three tiers of schools the child went to. However, because of the lack of technical schools, the Eleven-Plus came to be seen as a pass-or-fail exam, either earning children a place at their local grammar school or consigning them to a secondary modern. As such, &quot;passing&quot; the 11-plus came to be seen as essential for success in later life.

The 11-plus has been accused of having a significant cultural bias. This was certainly true of early papers. &quot;General reasoning&quot; questions could be about classical composers, or the functions performed by domestic servants – subjects which children from working class backgrounds would be less able to answer.

===Examination systems and relationship to further education===
Different types of schools entered their pupils for different examinations at age 16. Grammar school students would take General Certificate of Education (GCE) O-levels, while children at secondary moderns initially took no examinations at all. Some secondary modern schools offered qualifications that were set, for example, by regional examination boards, such as the Union of Lancashire and Cheshire Institutes and the Northern Counties Technical Examinations Council. The latter exam was taken after four years at secondary school. Such examinations were comparable with the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) which was introduced in 1965. Less demanding than GCE O-level, results in the GCE and CSE exams were graded on the same scale, with the top CSE grade, grade 1, being equivalent to a simple pass at GCE O-level.

Secondary moderns did over time develop O-level courses for bright students, but in 1963 only 41,056 pupils sat them, roughly one in ten. Some of these pupils&#x27; results were very good. Indeed, during the 1960s, students from secondary modern schools who took GCE &#x27;O&#x27; Levels were increasingly achieving results comparable to those being achieved by students from grammar schools. This was remarkable given the disadvantages of secondary modern schools compared to grammar schools in providing education for GCE O-Level candidates. Accordingly, the entire rationale for Tripartite streaming of students based upon the 11-plus examination was called into question.

Secondary modern schools continued in existence into the 1970s, and as time progressed more attention was given to the need to provide more challenging examinations, and to adopting the same approach to mixed abilities as the modern comprehensive system which existed at the same time.

Although the Butler Act offered further education for all, including students from secondary moderns, only children who went to grammar schools had a realistic chance of getting into university. Most secondary moderns did not offer A-levels, though many in Northern Ireland in the 1970s did. Although students could obtain them elsewhere, few did and in 1963 only 318 secondary modern pupils sat the exams. Only grammar schools offered facilities for students who were preparing for the entrance examinations required to go to Oxbridge.

==Decline==
===The fall of the meritocracy===
In 1958 the sociologist Michael Young published a book entitled &quot;The Rise of the Meritocracy&quot;. A mock-historical account of British education viewed from the year 2033, it satirised the beliefs of those who supported the Tripartite System. Young argued that grammar schools were instituting a new elite, the meritocracy, and building an underclass to match. If allowed to continue, selective education would lead to renewed inequality and eventually revolution.

This reflected a growing dissatisfaction on the left with the results of the Tripartite System. Whereas the previous generation of Labour politicians had focused on the social mobility afforded to those who passed their eleven plus, now concern became focused upon those who were sent to secondary moderns. Once the Tripartite System had been implemented, the middle classes were found to be much more likely to win places at grammar schools. It was feared that society was being divided into a well-educated middle class elite and a working class trapped in the secondary modern schools, or &quot;eggheads and serfs&quot;. To some on the left, such as Graham Savage of the LCC, it became an article of faith that the only way to bring about equality was by putting everyone through the same schools.

In July 1958 the Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell formally abandoned the Tripartite system, calling for &quot;grammar-school education for all&quot;. The party&#x27;s fiercest opponent of the grammar school was Gaitskell&#x27;s protégé, Anthony Crosland.

Experiments with comprehensive schools had begun in 1946 by the London County Council, and they had taken hold in a few places in the UK. Anglesey, London, Coventry, the West Riding and Leicestershire had all abolished the Tripartite System in the 50s and early 60s, for a variety of reasons. They offered an alternative to the existing system which was seized upon by its opponents. Comprehensives were held up as less divisive, and pupils were said to benefit from the abolition of selection.

Paradoxically, at the same time as Labour was attacking the Tripartite System for its inequalities, some in the middle class were increasingly upset at the social mobility it fostered. As educational testing became more exact and subject to less class bias, an increasing proportion of middle class children were being sent to secondary moderns. The Tripartite System fell victim to its own elitism, as the traditional supporters of the grammar schools began to worry about their own children&#x27;s educational future.

===Abolition in England and Wales===
By 1965, 65 local education authorities (LEAs) had plans to switch to comprehensive schools, and another 55 were considering it. Over the next few years this grassroots change would be reinforced by central government policy.

Labour had won the 1964 election, and Anthony Crosland became Secretary of State for Education in January 1965. He was an adamant critic of the tripartite system, and once remarked, &quot;If it&#x27;s the last thing I do, I&#x27;m going to destroy every last fucking grammar school in England. And Wales. And Northern Ireland.&quot; Soon after he came to office he issued Circular 10/65. This asked LEAs to begin planning the switch from the Tripartite System to the Comprehensive System, withholding funding for new school buildings from those that did not comply. This change would be reinforced by the Education Act 1968. By 1970, 115 LEAs had had their reorganisation plans approved. Thirteen had had theirs rejected, and a further ten had defied the Labour government and refused to submit any plans at all.

Initially the move generated little opposition. It was portrayed foremost as an effort to raise standards in secondary moderns, and Prime Minister Harold Wilson had promised that grammar schools would only be closed &quot;over my dead body&quot;. However, some grammar schools were closed, and many were amalgamated with nearby secondary moderns.

Opposition developed, mainly on a local level in protest of the treatment of a particular grammar school. Particularly strong opposition was noted in Bristol, after the LEA ended all grammar school education in 1964.

However, there was little nationwide organisation among the defenders of the Tripartite System. The most prominent attack on the introduction of comprehensives came in the series of Black Papers (as opposed to White Papers, which are issued by the government) published in the &quot;Critical Quarterly&quot; by A.E. Dyson and Brian Cox. Comprehensivisation was accused of using schools &quot;directly as tools to achieve social and political objectives&quot;, rather than for the education of pupils.

Debates over the Comprehensive system seemed about to become a major political issue, particularly with the election of a Conservative government in 1970. However many Tories were ambivalent on the issue. More grammar schools were closed under Margaret Thatcher than any other Education Secretary, but this was by now a local process, which was allowed to continue to avoid controversy. Her Circular 10/70 simply removed the compulsion of Circular 10/65, leaving it up to individual LEAs whether or not they would go comprehensive.

===Aftermath and legacy===
The end of the Tripartite System was reinforced by the new Labour government of 1974. One of its first actions on education was Circular 4/74, reiterating Labour&#x27;s intention to continue with comprehensivisation. The 1976 Education Act forbade selection of pupils by ability, officially ending the Tripartite System.

The abolition of the grammar schools benefitted private schools. Free, high-quality education for grammar school pupils had dramatically reduced independent school pupil numbers, from around 10% of the school population to 5.5% . However, now that comprehensive equality had been instituted, a large number of parents were willing to pay to extricate their children from it. Most of the direct grant grammar schools converted to fully fee-paying independent schools, retaining selection of entrants. The proportion of children opting out of the state system continued to rise until recently, standing at around 8%.

The counties of Lincolnshire, Buckinghamshire, and Kent continue to operate a form of the Tripartite System. Currently there are still 163 state-run grammar schools in England schooling 141,000 pupils per year.

The 1976 Act proved the high-point of the Comprehensive movement. Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government allowed selection once again in 1979, and it has been used increasingly by individual schools eager to choose those they perceive to be the best pupils. In 1984 Solihull attempted to reintroduce grammar schools, but was stopped by opposition. In 1986 the first City Technology Colleges were proposed, arguably inspired by the Technical schools, but in the 2000s most of them converted to academies. Today, no formal attempts are being made to restore the Tripartite System, but the perceived failure of the Comprehensive System led the next Labour government to propose &quot;Beacon Schools&quot;, &quot;Advanced Schools&quot; and an &quot;escalator&quot; or &quot;ladder&quot; of schools.

Secondary education in the UK has not been thoroughly overhauled since 1944, and is now a mixture of the Tripartite and Comprehensive System.

==Survival of the system in Northern Ireland==

While vestiges of the Tripartite system persist in several English counties, the largest area where the 11-plus system remains in operation is Northern Ireland. Original proposals for switching to the Comprehensive system were put forward in 1971, but the suspension of devolution meant that they were never acted upon. As a result, each year around 16,000 pupils in the area take the 11-plus transfer test. Pupils are rated between grades A and D, with preferred access to schools being given to those with higher grades.
Until 1989, around 1/3 of pupils who took the exam, or 27% of the age group, were given places in a grammar school.

Under the &quot;open enrolment&quot; reform of 1989, grammar schools in Northern Ireland (unlike the remaining grammar schools in England) were required to accept pupils up to their capacity, which was also increased.
Together with falling numbers of school-age children, this has led to a significant broadening of the grammar schools&#x27; intake.
By 2006, 42% of transferring children were admitted to grammar schools, and in only 7 of the 69 grammar schools was the intake limited to the top 30% of the cohort.

In 2001, following the publication of the Burns Report on Post Primary Education, the decision was taken to abolish the examination. The subsequent Costello Report went further, and advocated an end to all selection in Northern Ireland&#x27;s schooling. The education minister, Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin, endorsed the Burns Report, as did the Social Democratic and Labour Party, while the Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party politicians condemned it. When devolution was suspended in 2002, the Northern Ireland Office decided to continue the policy, although the phase-out date of the eleven plus was put back from 2004 to 2008.

Opinion is divided on the wisdom of the decision. The Burns Report itself called the 11-plus system socially divisive and argued that it placed unreasonable pressures on teachers.
Critics of the status quo in Northern Ireland say that primary education is overly focused on passing the 11-plus. Half of all students receive some kind of private tuition before going to the exam. Many pupils also say that the exam is a great source of stress.

Nevertheless, the existing system has produced good results. GCSE grades are much higher than in England and Wales. The number gaining five GCSEs at grades A-C, the standard measure of a good education, is ten percentage points higher. AS and A level results are also better. Access to universities is more equitable, with 41.3% of those from the bottom four socioeconomic groups going to university, as opposed to a national average of 28.4%.

Public opinion appears divided on the question. In a 2004 poll the people of Northern Ireland supported the abolition of the 11-plus by 55% to 41%. But they opposed the abolition of selective education 31% to 67%. There is widespread agreement that whatever the failings of the existing system, it is fair.

The last eleven plus took place in 2008, for the intake of September 2009.
It is proposed that the replacement system have an additional transfer point at age 14, with the possibility of differentiated provision from that point.
A school might, for example, specialise in providing an academic pathway from age 14.
The choice of the appropriate type of school for each student is to be based on a range of measures, including performance in secondary school but excluding a separate test.

A consortium of 25 grammar schools have announced their intention to run a common entry test for 2009 admissions.
One Catholic grammar school, Lumen Christi College, has also announced its intention to run its own tests.

==Debates==

The debate about the tripartite system still continues years after its abolition was initiated, and has evolved into a debate about the pros and cons of selective education in general. In general, the left-wing such as the Labour Party oppose selective education, whereas the right-wing such as the Conservative Party have traditionally supported it.

<text>}}&lt;/math&gt;

The square root of 2 (approximately 1.4142) is the positive real number that, when multiplied by itself or squared, equals the number 2. It may be written in mathematics as formula_1 or formula_2. It is an algebraic number, and therefore not a transcendental number. Technically, it should be called the &quot;principal&quot; square root of 2, to distinguish it from the negative number with the same property.

Geometrically, the square root of 2 is the length of a diagonal across a square with sides of one unit of length; this follows from the Pythagorean theorem. It was probably the first number known to be irrational. The fraction (≈ 1.4142857) is sometimes used as a good rational approximation with a reasonably small denominator.

Sequence in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences consists of the digits in the decimal expansion of the square root of 2, here truncated to 65 decimal places:

==History==

The Babylonian clay tablet YBC 7289 (–1600 BC) gives an approximation of formula_1 in four sexagesimal figures, , which is accurate to about six decimal digits, and is the closest possible three-place sexagesimal representation of formula_1, representing a margin of error of only –0.000042%:
:formula_5

Another early approximation is given in ancient Indian mathematical texts, the Sulbasutras (–200 BC), as follows: &quot;Increase the length [of the side] by its third and this third by its own fourth less the thirty-fourth part of that fourth.&quot; That is,
:formula_6

This approximation, diverging from the actual value of formula_1 by approximately +0.07%, is the seventh in a sequence of increasingly accurate approximations based on the sequence of Pell numbers, which can be derived from the continued fraction expansion of formula_1. Despite having a smaller denominator, it is only slightly less accurate than the Babylonian approximation.

Pythagoreans discovered that the diagonal of a square is incommensurable with its side, or in modern language, that the square root of two is irrational. Little is known with certainty about the time or circumstances of this discovery, but the name of Hippasus of Metapontum is often mentioned. For a while, the Pythagoreans treated as an official secret the discovery that the square root of two is irrational, and, according to legend, Hippasus was murdered for divulging it, though this has little to any substantial evidence in traditional historian practice. The square root of two is occasionally called Pythagoras&#x27;s number or Pythagoras&#x27;s constant.

===Ancient Roman architecture===
In ancient Roman architecture, Vitruvius describes the use of the square root of 2 progression or &quot;ad quadratum&quot; technique. It consists basically in a geometric, rather than arithmetic, method to double a square, in which the diagonal of the original square is equal to the side of the resulting square. Vitruvius attributes the idea to Plato. The system was employed to build pavements by creating a square tangent to the corners of the original square at 45 degrees of it. The proportion was also used to design atria by giving them a length equal to a diagonal taken from a square, whose sides are equivalent to the intended atrium&#x27;s width.

==Decimal value==
===Computation algorithms===

There are many algorithms for approximating formula_1 as a ratio of integers or as a decimal. The most common algorithm for this, which is used as a basis in many computers and calculators, is the Babylonian method for computing square roots, an example of Newton&#x27;s method for computing roots of arbitrary functions. It goes as follows:

First, pick a guess, formula_10; the value of the guess affects only how many iterations are required to reach an approximation of a certain accuracy. Then, using that guess, iterate through the following recursive computation:

:formula_11

Each iteration improves the approximation, roughly doubling the number of correct digits. Starting with formula_12, the subsequent iterations yield:

:formula_13

===Rational approximations===
A simple rational approximation (≈ 1.4142857) is sometimes used. Despite having a denominator of only 70, it differs from the correct value by less than (approx. ). 

The next two better rational approximations are (≈ 1.4141414...) with a marginally smaller error (approx. ), and (≈ 1.4142012) with an error of approx .

The rational approximation of the square root of two derived from four iterations of the Babylonian method after starting with () is too large by about ; its square is ≈ .

===Records in computation===
In 1997, the value of formula_1 was calculated to 137,438,953,444 decimal places by Yasumasa Kanada&#x27;s team. In February 2006, the record for the calculation of formula_1 was eclipsed with the use of a home computer. Shigeru Kondo calculated one trillion decimal places in 2010. Other mathematical constants whose decimal expansions have been calculated to similarly high precision include , , and the golden ratio. Such computations provide empirical evidence of whether these numbers are normal.

This is a table of recent records in calculating the digits of formula_1.
==Proofs of irrationality==
===Proof by infinite descent===
One proof of the number&#x27;s irrationality is the following proof by infinite descent. It is also a proof of a negation by refutation: it proves the statement &quot;formula_1 is not rational&quot; by assuming that it is rational and then deriving a falsehood.

# Assume that formula_1 is a rational number, meaning that there exists a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly formula_1.
# If the two integers have a common factor, it can be eliminated using the Euclidean algorithm.
# Then formula_1 can be written as an irreducible fraction formula_21 such that and are coprime integers (having no common factor) which additionally means that at least one of or must be odd.
# It follows that formula_22 and formula_23.   (  )   ( are integers)
# Therefore, is even because it is equal to . ( is necessarily even because it is 2 times another whole number.)
# It follows that must be even (as squares of odd integers are never even).
# Because is even, there exists an integer that fulfills formula_24.
# Substituting from step 7 for in the second equation of step 4: formula_25, which is equivalent to formula_26.
# Because is divisible by two and therefore even, and because formula_27, it follows that is also even which means that is even.
# By steps 5 and 8, and are both even, which contradicts step 3 (that formula_21 is irreducible).

Since we have derived a falsehood, the assumption (1) that formula_1 is a rational number must be false. This means that formula_1 is not a rational number; that is to say, formula_1 is irrational.

This proof was hinted at by Aristotle, in his &quot;Analytica Priora&quot;, §I.23. It appeared first as a full proof in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, as proposition 117 of Book X. However, since the early 19th century, historians have agreed that this proof is an interpolation and not attributable to Euclid.

===Proof using reciprocals===
Assume by way of contradiction that formula_32 were rational. Then we may write formula_33 as an irreducible fraction in lowest terms, with coprime positive integers formula_34. Since formula_35, it follows that formula_36 can be expressed as the irreducible fraction formula_37. However, since formula_36 and formula_39 differ by an integer, it follows that the denominators of their irreducible fraction representations must be the same, i.e. formula_40. This gives the desired contradiction.

===Proof by unique factorization===
As with the proof by infinite descent, we obtain formula_41. Being the same quantity, each side has the same prime factorization by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and in particular, would have to have the factor 2 occur the same number of times. However, the factor 2 appears an odd number of times on the right, but an even number of times on the left—a contradiction.

===Application of the rational root theorem===
The irrationality of formula_1 also follows from the rational root theorem, which states that a rational root of a polynomial, if it exists, must be the quotient of a factor of the constant term and a factor of the leading coefficient. In the case of formula_43, the only possible rational roots are formula_44 and formula_45. As formula_1 is not equal to formula_44 or formula_45, it follows that formula_1 is irrational. This application also invokes the integer root theorem, a stronger version of the rational root theorem for the case when formula_50 is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients; for such a polynomial, all roots are necessarily integers (which formula_1 is not, as 2 is not a perfect square) or irrational.

The rational root theorem (or integer root theorem) may be used to show that any square root of any natural number that is not a perfect square is irrational. For other proofs that the square root of any non-square natural number is irrational, see Quadratic irrational number or Infinite descent.

===Geometric proofs===

A simple proof is attributed to Stanley Tennenbaum when he was a student in the early 1950s. Assume that formula_52, where formula_53 and formula_54 are coprime positive integers. Then formula_53 and formula_54 are the smallest positive integers for which formula_41. Now consider two squares with sides formula_53 and formula_54, and place two copies of the smaller square inside the larger one as shown in Figure 1. The area of the square overlap region in the centre must equal the sum of the areas of the two uncovered squares. Hence there exist positive integers formula_60 and formula_61 such that formula_62. Since it can be seen geometrically that formula_63 and formula_64, this contradicts the original assumption.
Tom M. Apostol made another geometric &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; argument showing that formula_1 is irrational. It is also an example of proof by infinite descent. It makes use of classic compass and straightedge construction, proving the theorem by a method similar to that employed by ancient Greek geometers. It is essentially the same algebraic proof as in the previous paragraph, viewed geometrically in another way.

Let be a right isosceles triangle with hypotenuse length and legs as shown in Figure 2. By the Pythagorean theorem, formula_66. Suppose and are integers. Let be a ratio given in its lowest terms.

Draw the arcs and with centre . Join . It follows that , and and coincide. Therefore, the triangles and are congruent by SAS.

Because is a right angle and is half a right angle, is also a right isosceles triangle. Hence implies . By symmetry, , and is also a right isosceles triangle. It also follows that .

Hence, there is an even smaller right isosceles triangle, with hypotenuse length and legs . These values are integers even smaller than and and in the same ratio, contradicting the hypothesis that is in lowest terms. Therefore, and cannot be both integers; hence, formula_1 is irrational.

===Constructive proof===
While the proofs by infinite descent are constructively valid when &quot;irrational&quot; is defined to mean &quot;not rational&quot;, we can obtain a constructively stronger statement by using a positive definition of &quot;irrational&quot; as &quot;quantifiably apart from every rational&quot;. Let and be positive integers such that (as satisfies these bounds). Now and cannot be equal, since the first has an odd number of factors 2 whereas the second has an even number of factors 2. Thus . Multiplying the absolute difference by in the numerator and denominator, we get
:formula_68

the latter inequality being true because it is assumed that , giving (otherwise the quantitative apartness can be trivially established). This gives a lower bound of for the difference , yielding a direct proof of irrationality in its constructively stronger form, not relying on the law of excluded middle. This proof constructively exhibits an explicit discrepancy between formula_1 and any rational.

===Proof by Pythagorean triples===
This proof uses the following property of primitive Pythagorean triples:

: If , , and are coprime positive integers such that , then is never even.

This lemma can be used to show that two identical perfect squares can never be added to produce another perfect square.

Suppose the contrary that formula_70 is rational. Therefore,

:formula_71
:where formula_72 and formula_73
:Squaring both sides,
:formula_74
:formula_75
:formula_76

Here, is a primitive Pythagorean triple, and from the lemma is never even. However, this contradicts the equation which implies that must be even.

==Multiplicative inverse==
The multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) of the square root of two is a widely used constant, with the decimal value:

It is often encountered in geometry and trigonometry because the unit vector, which makes a 45° angle with the axes in a plane, has the coordinates
:formula_77
Each coordinate satisfies
:formula_78

==Properties==
One interesting property of formula_1 is
:formula_80
since
:formula_81
This is related to the property of silver ratios.

formula_1 can also be expressed in terms of copies of the imaginary unit using only the square root and arithmetic operations, if the square root symbol is interpreted suitably for the complex numbers and :
:formula_83
formula_1 is also the only real number other than 1 whose infinite tetrate (i.e., infinite exponential tower) is equal to its square. In other words: if for , and for , the limit of as will be called (if this limit exists) . Then formula_1 is the only number for which . Or symbolically:

:formula_86

formula_1 appears in Viète&#x27;s formula for ,

:formula_88

which is related to the formula
:formula_89

Similar in appearance but with a finite number of terms, formula_1 appears in various trigonometric constants:
:formula_91

It is not known whether formula_1 is a normal number, which is a stronger property than irrationality, but statistical analyses of its binary expansion are consistent with the hypothesis that it is normal to base two.

==Representations==
===Series and product===
The identity , along with the infinite product representations for the sine and cosine, leads to products such as
:formula_93
and
:formula_94
or equivalently,
:formula_95

The number can also be expressed by taking the Taylor series of a trigonometric function. For example, the series for gives
:formula_96
The Taylor series of with and using the double factorial gives

:formula_97

The convergence of this series can be accelerated with an Euler transform, producing

:formula_98
It is not known whether formula_1 can be represented with a BBP-type formula. BBP-type formulas are known for and , however.

The number can be represented by an infinite series of Egyptian fractions, with denominators defined by 2&quot;n&quot;&amp;hairsp;th terms of a Fibonacci-like recurrence relation &quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 34&quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;−1) − &quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;−2), &quot;a&quot;(0) = 0, &quot;a&quot;(1) = 6.

===Continued fraction===

The square root of two has the following continued fraction representation:
:formula_101

The convergents formed by truncating this representation form a sequence of fractions that approximate the square root of two to increasing accuracy, and that are described by the Pell numbers (i.e., ). The first convergents are: and the convergent following is . The convergent differs from formula_1 by almost exactly , which follows from:
:formula_103

===Nested square===
The following nested square expressions converge to 
:formula_104

==Applications==
===Paper size===
In 1786, German physics professor Georg Christoph Lichtenberg found that any sheet of paper whose long edge is formula_1 times longer than its short edge could be folded in half and aligned with its shorter side to produce a sheet with exactly the same proportions as the original. This ratio of lengths of the longer over the shorter side guarantees that cutting a sheet in half along a line results in the smaller sheets having the same (approximate) ratio as the original sheet. When Germany standardised paper sizes at the beginning of the 20th century, they used Lichtenberg&#x27;s ratio to create the &quot;A&quot; series of paper sizes. Today, the (approximate) aspect ratio of paper sizes under ISO 216 (A4, A0, etc.) is 1:formula_1.

Proof:

Let formula_107 shorter length and formula_108 longer length of the sides of a sheet of paper, with
:formula_109 as required by ISO 216.
Let formula_110 be the analogous ratio of the halved sheet, then
:formula_111

===Physical sciences===
There are some interesting properties involving the square root of 2 in the physical sciences:
* The square root of two is the frequency ratio of a tritone interval in twelve-tone equal temperament music.
* The square root of two forms the relationship of f-stops in photographic lenses, which in turn means that the ratio of &quot;areas&quot; between two successive apertures is 2.
* The celestial latitude (declination) of the Sun during a planet&#x27;s astronomical cross-quarter day points equals the tilt of the planet&#x27;s axis divided by formula_1.

* In the brain there are lattice cells, discovered in 2005 by a group led by May-Britt and Edvard Moser. &quot;The grid cells were found in the cortical area located right next to the hippocampus [...] At one end of this cortical area the mesh size is small and at the other it is very large. However, the increase in mesh size is not left to chance, but increases by the squareroot of two from one area to the next.&quot;

<text>Process music is music that arises from a process. It may make that process audible to the listener, or the process may be concealed.

Primarily begun in the 1960s, diverse composers have employed divergent methods and styles of process. &quot;A &#x27;musical process&#x27; as Christensen defines it is a highly complex dynamic phenomenon involving audible structures that evolve in the course of the musical performance ... 2nd order audible developments, i.e., audible developments within audible developments&quot;. These processes may involve specific systems of choosing and arranging notes through pitch and time, often involving a long term change with a limited amount of musical material, or transformations of musical events that are already relatively complex in themselves.

Steve Reich defines process music not as, &quot;the process of composition but rather pieces of music that are, literally, processes. The distinctive thing about musical processes is that they determine all the note-to-note (sound-to-sound) details and the overall form simultaneously. (Think of a round or infinite canon.)&quot;

==History==
Although today often used synonymously with minimalism, the term predates the appearance of this style by at least twenty years. Elliott Carter, for example, used the word &quot;process&quot; to describe the complex compositional shapes he began using around 1944, with works like the Piano Sonata and First String Quartet, and continued to use throughout his life. Carter came to his conception of music as process from Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;principle of organism&quot;, and particularly from his 1929 book, &quot;Process and Reality&quot;.

Michael Nyman has stated that &quot;the origins of this minimal process music lie in serialism&quot;. Kyle Gann also sees many similarities between serialism and minimalism, and Herman Sabbe has demonstrated how process music functions in the early serial works of the Belgian composer Karel Goeyvaerts, especially in his electronic compositions &quot;Nr. 4, met dode tonen&quot; [with dead tones] (1952) and &quot;Nr. 5, met zuivere tonen&quot; [with pure tones] (1953). Elsewhere, Sabbe makes a similar demonstration for &quot;Kreuzspiel&quot; (1951) by Karlheinz Stockhausen.

Beginning in the early 1960s, Stockhausen composed several instrumental works which he called &quot;process compositions&quot;, in which symbols including plus, minus, and equal signs are used to indicate successive transformations of sounds which are unspecified or unforeseeable by the composer. They specify &quot;how sounds are to be changed or imitated rather than what they are to be&quot;. In these compositions, &quot;structure is a system of invariants; these invariants are not substances but relations. ... Stockhausen&#x27;s Process Planning is structural analysis in reversed time-direction. Composition as abstraction, as generalization. Analysis of reality before its entry into existence&quot;. These works include &quot;Plus-Minus&quot; (1963), &quot;Prozession&quot; (1967), &quot;Kurzwellen&quot;, and &quot;Spiral&quot; (both 1968), and led to the verbally described processes of the intuitive music compositions in the cycles &quot;Aus den sieben Tagen&quot; (1968) and &quot;Für kommende Zeiten&quot; (1968–70).)

The term &quot;Process Music&quot; (in the minimalist sense) was coined by composer Steve Reich in his 1968 manifesto entitled &quot;Music as a Gradual Process&quot; in which he very carefully yet briefly described the entire concept including such definitions as phasing and the use of phrases in composing or creating this music, as well as his ideas as to its purpose and a brief history of his discovery of it.

For Steve Reich it was important that the processes be audible: &quot;I am interested in perceptible processes. I want to be able to hear the process happening throughout the sounding music. ... What I&#x27;m interested in is a compositional process and a sounding music that are one and the same thing&quot;. This has not necessarily been the case for other composers, however. Reich himself points to John Cage as an example of a composer who used compositional processes that could not be heard when the piece was performed. The postminimalist David Lang is another composer who does not want people to hear the process he uses to build a piece of music.

==Theory==
Michael Nyman has identified five types of process:
#Chance determination processes, in which the material is not determined by the composer directly, but through a system he or she creates
#People processes, in which performers are allowed to move through given or suggested material, each at his or her own speed
#Contextual processes, in which actions depend on unpredictable conditions and on variables arising from the musical continuity
#Repetition processes, in which movement is generated solely by extended repetition
#Electronic processes, in which some or all aspects of the music are determined by the use of electronics. These processes take many forms.
The first type is not necessarily confined to what are normally recognised as &quot;chance&quot; compositions, however. For example, in Karel Goeyvaerts&#x27;s Sonata for Two Pianos, &quot;registral process created a form that depended neither on conventional models nor ... on the composer&#x27;s taste and judgment. Given a few simple rules, the music did not need to be &#x27;composed&#x27; at all: the notes would be at play of themselves&quot;.

Galen H. Brown acknowledges Nyman&#x27;s five categories and proposes adding a sixth: mathematical process, which includes the manipulation of materials by means of permutation, addition, subtraction, multiplication, changes of rate, and so on.

Erik Christensen identifies six process categories:
#Rule-determined transformation processes
#goal-directed transformation processes
#indeterminate transformation processes
#Rule-determined generative processes
#goal-directed, and generative processes
#indeterminate generative processes
He describes Reich&#x27;s &quot;Piano Phase&quot; (1966) as rule-determined transformation process, Cage&#x27;s &quot;Variations II&quot; (1961) as an indeterminate generative process, Ligeti&#x27;s &quot;In zart fliessender Bewegung&quot; (1976) as a goal-directed transformation process containing a number of evolution processes, and Per Nørgård&#x27;s &quot;Second Symphony&quot; (1970) as containing a rule-determined generative process of a fractal nature.

<text>Bertram Neville Brockhouse, (July 15, 1918 – October 13, 2003) was a Canadian physicist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics (1994, shared with Clifford Shull) &quot;for pioneering contributions to the development of neutron scattering techniques for studies of condensed matter&quot;, in particular &quot;for the development of neutron spectroscopy&quot;.

==Education and early life==
Brockhouse was born in Lethbridge, Alberta, to a family of English descent. He was a graduate of the University of British Columbia (BA, 1947) and the University of Toronto (MA, 1948; Ph.D, 1950).

==Career and research==
From 1950 to 1962, Brockhouse carried out research at Atomic Energy of Canada&#x27;s Chalk River Nuclear Laboratory. Here he was joined by P. K. Iyengar, who is treated as the father of India&#x27;s nuclear program.

In 1962, he became a professor at McMaster University in Canada, where he remained until his retirement in 1984.

Brockhouse died on October 13, 2003, in Hamilton, Ontario, aged 85.

==Awards and honours==
Brockhouse was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1965. In 1982, Brockhouse was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1995.

Brockhouse shared the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics with American Clifford Shull of MIT for developing neutron scattering techniques for studying condensed matter.

In October 2005, as part of the 75th anniversary of McMaster University&#x27;s establishment in Hamilton, Ontario, a street on the university campus (University Avenue) was renamed to Brockhouse Way in honour of Brockhouse. The town of Deep River, Ontario, has also named a street in his honour.

The Nobel Prize that Bertram Brockhouse won (shared with Clifford Shull) in 1994 was awarded after the longest-ever waiting time (counting from the time when the award-winning research had been carried out).

In 1999 the Division of Condensed Matter and Materials Physics (DCMMP) and the Canadian Association of Physicists (CAP) created a medal in honour of Brockhouse. The medal is called the Brockhouse Medal and is awarded to recognize and encourage outstanding experimental or theoretical contributions to condensed matter and materials physics. This medal is awarded annually on the basis of outstanding experimental or theoretical contributions to condensed matter physics. An eligible candidate must have performed their research primarily with a Canadian Institution.

<doc id="341714" wikidata="Q486050" url="?curid=341714" title="Anaphora (rhetoric)">
<text>In rhetoric, an anaphora (, &quot;carrying back&quot;) is a rhetorical device that consists of repeating a sequence of words at the beginnings of neighboring clauses, thereby lending them emphasis. In contrast, an epistrophe (or epiphora) is repeating words at the clauses&#x27; ends. The combination of anaphora and epistrophe results in symploce.

==Functions==
Other than the function of emphasizing ideas, the use of anaphora as a rhetorical device adds rhythm to a word as well as making it more pleasurable to read and easier to remember. Anaphora is repetition at the beginning of a sentence to create emphasis. Anaphora serves the purpose of delivering an artistic effect to a passage. It is also used to appeal to the emotions of the audience in order to persuade, inspire, motivate and encourage them. In Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, he uses anaphora by repeating &quot;I have a dream&quot; eight times throughout the speech.

==Usage==

Today, anaphora is seen in many different contexts, including songs, movies, television, political speeches, poetry, and prose.
