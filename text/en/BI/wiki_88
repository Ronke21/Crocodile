<doc id="354216" wikidata="Q6036252" url="?curid=354216" title="Innovations in the piano">
<text>Piano construction is by now a rather conservative area; most of the technological advances were made by about 1900, and indeed it is possible that some contemporary piano buyers might actually be suspicious of pianos that are made differently from the older kind. Yet piano manufacturers, especially the smaller ones, are still experimenting with ways to build better pianos.

In the early 21st century, the obvious way to raise the technological level of any mechanical device is to use digital technology to control it (compare the mid 19th century, where the obvious route was to make some of its parts from steel; e.g. piano strings). Of course, digital technology &quot;has&quot; been incorporated into pianos, and this innovation is discussed below. But in a sense, it is a far greater challenge to improve the piano in its own terms, as a mechanical/acoustic device. This challenge pits the modern piano designer against some of the finest engineering minds of the nineteenth century, an era when pianos represented some of the most sophisticated of all technological achievements. Nineteenth-century piano innovation was, moreover, financed by a far more robust piano market than exists today.

A few of the &quot;innovations&quot; discussed below were actually present in at least some pianos in the distant past. They are innovations to the extent that the old idea had become unfamiliar to most of the piano community through long disuse.

For clarification of the various parts of the piano mentioned below, see the Wikipedia article piano.

== Acoustic and mechanical innovations ==
===Actions===
The Fandrich &amp; Sons piano company of Stanwood, Washington was set up to produce pianos with the &quot;Fandrich vertical action&quot;, a new kind of piano action developed by Darrell Fandrich and Chris Trivelas. It is intended to provide the same sensitivity of touch to upright pianos that is available in grands. Currently, Fandrich and Sons installs the Fandrich action in pianos made by the Bohemia firm, in the Czech Republic.

The Fazioli piano company of Sacile, Italy, is now selling pianos with two (or more) actions. The idea is that different actions can be regulated and voiced according to the requirements of particular players or musical styles. Since piano actions are built as a single unit, they can be removed or inserted with just a few minutes&#x27; work.

The Magnetic Balanced Action system, invented by Evert Snel and Hans Velo in the Netherlands, permits variable touch according to the player&#x27;s preference. The idea of the system is to use the force of magnets, whose position is adjustable, to regulate the touch-weight of the keys, rather than fixed weights. This system is now a factory option on Fazioli and Petrof pianos, and can be custom installed on other pianos.

The Kawai Piano company of Japan has in recent years created an action out of an ABS styran/carbon composite. There are no independent reviews of this method.

The Wessel, Nickel and Gross company makes custom actions for grand pianos (and uprights) that are also epoxy carbon fiber. Unlike Kawai, WNG uses composite material for the hammer shank also.

=== Bridge agraffes ===
The Stuart and Sons piano company of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, makes a piano in which there are bridge agraffes. Agraffes are a kind of sturdy metal clip that hold the strings in place. They were invented in 1808 by the piano pioneer Sébastien Érard and have long been employed in quality pianos to terminate the front (i.e., closer to the player) end of the string. The Stuart and Sons Agraffe device is used to couple the strings to the bridge and soundboard structure. The agraffe defines the string&#x27;s speaking length (frequency), containing the reaction forces produced by bending the strings as they pass through it. This mechanism negates the need for string down bearing that is required in the traditional pinned bridge system. This method, scientifically proven, ensures a more efficient transmission of sound from the strings to the soundboard, able to make the strings vibrate in a more controlled way, improving the dynamics and ensuring a more successful support.

The American company Sohmer, along with Blüthner in Europe, among others, applied this idea to the string termination on the bridge in pianos beginning in the 1890s, where bridge pins are ordinarily used. Most applications of agraffes have been located at the near end of the strings, close to the tuning pins. Stuart has reintroduced the use of agraffes on the bridges (of which their pianos have two).

It is claimed that bridge agraffes permit efficient transmission of sound from the strings to the soundboard, resulting in a very well-sustained tone. Similar results are noted with the brass agraffe used by Sohmer into the 1930s.

Since the strings do not need to bear down heavily on the bridges (a force of 600 to 1200 pounds = 2.7 to 5.4 kN in conventional pianos), bridge agraffes may also help preserve the crucial upward curve, or &quot;crown,&quot; in the soundboard.

The Phoenix Piano of the UK also uses a specially designed bridge agraffe to greatly reduce the force exerted on the soundboard, and allowing it to be made of carbon fiber composite instead of wood.

===Carbon fiber soundboards===
The soundboard needs to meet two conflicting requirements. First of all, there must be sufficient transmission of vibratory energy from the string to the soundboard that our ears are ultimately provided with a sound of satisfactory loudness. If the soundboard were a plate of steel 4 cm thick instead of a wooden board about 1 cm thick, its wave impedance would be increased several hundredfold and we would hear almost nothing from the soundboard, nor would the string produce much sound directly in the air. If on the other hand the disturbance excited on the string by the hammer were communicated to the soundboard at too rapid a rate, these vibrations would die down so quickly that we would hear little more than a tuned thud, a louder version of what is produced by hitting a note while a wadded handkerchief is firmly pressed against the vibrating part of the string next to the bridge. We also want the soundboard impedance to be high enough that its resonances will not play an unacceptably large role in the tuning of individual string modes. It is a long-standing practice to make piano soundboards of spruce, a wood that is both light and stiff; for discussion see tonewood.

Phoenix Piano Systems of the UK has experimented with soundboard made of carbon fiber composite, which they claim can be made with better sounding qualities than wood, and without the swelling, shrinking and cracking that affect wood. Phoenix Piano has now for sale pianos with carbon fiber composite soundboard, built by Steingraeber &amp; Sohne.

===Larger soundboards===
The Astin-Weight piano company of Salt Lake City, Utah, introduced two related innovations to the upright piano which were designed and patented by Edwin R. Astin Sr. Their purpose was to obtain the largest possible soundboard, and indeed, Astin-Weight soundboards covered the entire rear surface of the piano. This was made possible by placing the pinblock forward of the soundboard, and using a peripheral metal frame instead of back posts. The Astin-Weight piano was said to produce a very rich tone, not to every listener&#x27;s taste but greatly prized by Astin-Weight owners. The company is no longer in business.

===Extended keyboards===
Almost every modern piano has 36 black keys and 52 white keys for a total of 88 keys (seven octaves plus a minor third, from A0 to C8). Most makers standardized around the 88 key format during the 1880s and 1890s. Many older pianos only have 85 keys (seven octaves from A0 to A7), while some manufacturers extend the range further in one or both directions.

Henri Pape experimented with an eight-octave (F-to-F) keyboard range in the mid 1840s.

Former French maker Erard (known for inventing the double escapement principle still used in grand actions today) added two extra keys at the low end (i.e., G instead of A) on some concert grands as far back as 1877, for a total of 90 keys.

Some Bösendorfer pianos extend the normal range downwards to F0 (models 213, 225 and 275) with one other model (290) going as far as a bottom C0, making a full eight-octave range. These extra keys are sometimes hidden under a small hinged lid that can be flipped down to cover the keys in order to avoid visual disorientation in a pianist unfamiliar with the extended keyboard. On others, the colours of the extra white keys are reversed (black instead of white).

The Bösendorfer extended-range pianos, while innovatory relative to the standard grand, are hardly new; they date from the early 20th century. According to the Bösendorfer firm, the impetus for building these instruments came from the celebrated pianist Ferruccio Busoni, who at the time was performing his transcriptions of organ works by J. S. Bach. He sought very deep notes to achieve a better approximation of organ sound.

The Stuart and Sons company manufactures extended-range pianos, with all of their pianos having 97 or 102 keys, and now 108. On their instruments, the note range extends from F0 or C0 to F8, a full eight or eight and a half octaves. The extra keys are the same as the other keys in appearance. Stuart and Sons introduced a 108 key piano in 2018, extending the upper range to B8.

===Concave keyboard===
Virtually all keyboards are built in a straight line, with the keys aligned in exactly the same direction. This practice is the simplest from the viewpoint of instrument design, but is not necessarily the optimum for the player, who must employ quite different wrist, arm, and body motions when playing at the extreme treble and bass ends of the keyboard. It also places the extreme treble and bass at a great distance from each other. An alternative is to give the keyboard a concave form, curving slightly around the player. This presents the keys at a more uniform angle and places the extreme treble and bass at a somewhat closer distance. Such a keyboard has been called &quot;ergonomic,&quot; similarly to ergonomic keyboards used for typing.

Concave keyboards were produced from time to time from the late 18th to the early 20th century. A spectacular 21st century version was conceived by the architect Rafael Viñoly and realized in collaboration with piano maker Chris Maene of Belgium. This instrument, a full-length concert grand, not only has a concave 88-key keyboard, but is built in a laterally bulging form, so that the widest part of the case is some distance from the player. The very broad shape implies an unusually large soundboard. In addition, the strings fan out radially from the keyboard, roughly matching the orientation of their keys; hence the instrument is straight-strung rather than cross-strung, a practice held by Maene to be sonically beneficial.

===The pedal piano redux===

The pedal piano is a piano with both a manual keyboard and a pedal keyboard (or pedalboard). The pedalboard either plays the same piano as the manual keyboard or has its own dedicated piano.

In its modern 21st-century incarnation the pedal piano takes on two forms, namely the Borgato double piano, a dedicated installation of two grand pianos, one on the top of the other, of which the lower one is played with the pedalboard of the system; and the Pinchi Pedal System which is designed to connect any two standard grand pianos, of which the lower one is played with a pedalboard which acts on the standard grand piano manual keyboard of the lower piano through the Pinchi Pedal System.
The Borgato workshop, in Sossano, Italy, has produced the Doppio Borgato, a large double piano with pedal board, as on an organ. The bass piano, operated by the pedals, sits under the main piano, and the damper pedals of the two are coupled. This instrument permits the performance of a variety of works written by classical composers for pedal piano.
On April 27, 2012, the Pinchi Pedalpiano System, designed by Italian organ builder Claudio Pinchi and Italian pianist Roberto Prosseda, and built by the organ building enterprise Fratelli Pinchi Ars Organi. The Fratelli Pinchi siblings are Andrea, Claudio and Barbara Pinchi. As of June 2013, the Fratelli Pinchi Ars Organi website does not provide any information regarding the Pinchi Pedalpiano System. It is a pedalboard which works with any two standard 88-key grand pianos. The Pinchi pedalboard has 37 pedals (from A to A three octaves up) but the Pinchi Pedalpiano System has a total range of five octaves, thanks to 61 wooden &quot;fingers&quot;, as can be seen in the adjacent picture, which play, that is depress, the lower 61 keys (A0 to A5) of the lower piano, and which &quot;fingers&quot; are mapped to the 37 note pedalboard in three independent three octave stops (A0–A3 for 16&#x27;, A1–A4 for 8&#x27;, and A2–A5 for 4&#x27;).

===Aliquot stringing===

Aliquot stringing is the use of extra unstruck strings in the piano for the purpose of enriching the tone. The aliquot stringing system was invented by Julius Blüthner in 1873. As currently implemented, the Blüthner aliquot stringing system uses a fourth string in each note of the top three octaves. This string is raised slightly with respect to the other three strings, so that it is not struck by the hammer. Whenever the hammer strikes the three conventional strings, the aliquot string vibrates sympathetically, adding to the complexity of the tone. This same string resonance effect occurs, on a more limited scale, when other notes on the piano are played that are harmonically related to the pitch of an aliquot string.

===Tunable duplex scaling===

Both Fazioli and Mason and Hamlin (of Haverhill, Massachusetts) employ tunable duplex scaling. The idea behind duplex scaling, invented by Theodore Steinway in 1872, is that the non-speaking portion of the string, located between the non-speaking bridge pin and the hitch pin (formerly considered the &quot;waste end&quot; and damped with a strip of cloth), resounds in sympathy with the vibrating portion of the string. Steinway &amp; Sons&#x27; earliest employment of the duplex scale made use of aliquots, individually positionable (hence tunable) contact points, where each note of the duplex scale bears a perfect harmonic, intervallic relationship to its speaking length, i.e., an octave or fifth whether doubled or tripled. Because it was time-consuming to correctly position each aliquot, Steinway abandoned individual aliquots for continuous cast metal bars, each comprising an entire section of duplex bridge points. Their feeling was that with an accurately templated bridge and carefully located duplex bar, the same result would be achieved with far less fuss.

Mason &amp; Hamlin, however, embraced Theodore Steinway&#x27;s original idea. They felt that the tuning of these short stretches of free string can be achieved with greater accuracy than can be attained with a duplex bar. With the fixed points of a duplex bar, small variations in casting are liable to produce imperfections in the duplex string lengths. Furthermore, since variations in humidity can cause duplex scales to move in pitch more rapidly than the speaking scale, manual readjustment of the string tension on the non-speaking side of the bridge, and/or a readjustment of the duplex position to better accommodate humidity fluctuation, is feasible with individual aliquots.

More recently, Fazioli has modified Theodore Steinway&#x27;s original idea by creating a stainless-steel track, fixed to the cast iron plate, on which aliquots slide. This system improves the ease with which aliquots can be adjusted, both during manufacture and during subsequent service.

===Four strings per note===
Borgato pianos also feature four strings per note in the treble section. The fourth string is actually struck, and is not an aliquot string as in Blüthner pianos. This practice has been seen at various times in the history of the piano: an early example was given by Conrad Graf to Ludwig van Beethoven, and later examples are seen ca. 1900 (Luis Casali, Barcelona) and 1940 (August Förster).

===Size===
Fazioli has also made bold efforts in increasing the sheer size of the piano: their model F308 is the largest regular production piano currently built, being long and one and a half times as heavy as the popular Steinway model D.

The Rubenstein R-371 is a custom built piano that is 12 feet 2 inches long (3.71 m), weighs , and features a jig-welded steel plate.

Steinbuhler &amp; Company produce keyboards that are 7/8 and 15/16 normal size. The keyboards were designed to make it possible for players with smaller hands to play a larger range of music. The company sells keyboard inserts for Grand pianos and complete upright pianos with smaller (7/8) keyboards.

The Modell 370i, built by David Klavins, is a custom 88-key upright piano permanently installed at the University of Tübingen in Germany. The number 370 refers to the number of centimeters of the height of the piano (12 feet), while the i stands for &quot;integrated&quot; (into a building, as opposed to free-standing). The keyboard and action are situated near the top of the piano. In order to play the instrument, a performer must climb a flight of stairs to an elevated platform and walk around to sit down in front of the piano. The entire piano weighs two thousand pounds. The frame and soundboard of the piano are supported by two vertical beams of steel, and the fully exposed soundboard has over twice the area of the Steinway Model D. The lowest bass string (A0) is only 3mm thick, and its speaking length is 9.94 feet. Klavins is also planning the installation of a Modell 450i, which will be nearly 15 feet tall and include 102 notes, from a low C0 (like the Bösendorfer Imperial 290) to F8, five notes above the highest C on most pianos.

Adrian Mann of New Zealand started on a project of building a 5.7 m (18.7 ft) long piano when he was aged 16. Known as the Alexander piano, it has been played by many artists.

===Pianos of unusual appearance===
The concert grands that appear on world&#x27;s stages bear very little overt decoration. Normally, they are a uniform black, with plain legs of square cross-section and square, purely functional frames to hold the pedals. This approach was not the norm for keyboard instruments at earlier stages of history: 19th century pianos often had cases in veneered wood, with elaborated carved music stands and legs, and often gilded highlights. Going back further, the piano&#x27;s immediate ancestor, the harpsichord, was often decorated with great exuberance, often in bright colors and in some cases with artwork made by skilled painters. Creative modern piano companies today occasionally offer models that are designed by artists and are intended to break out of the prevalent plain-black pattern.
The Schimmel piano company has made experiments along these lines. These include a grand piano whose rim, lid, and other case parts are made of acrylic glass. The acoustic properties of the material used are claimed to be excellent. However, the somewhat lurid appearance of the acrylic piano, as well as its high cost, have kept it a novelty item. Schimmel has also teamed up with artists Otmar Alt and Luigi Colani to produce other pianos of breathtakingly unconventional appearance; see figure at right.

While the Steinway firm&#x27;s mainline offerings are very sober-looking, as discussed above, they do offer individual customers a variety of rather flamboyant forms of decoration as a &quot;bespoke&quot; option. In 1988, the firm created a visually very striking special version of its model D concert grand to commemorate the company&#x27;s 135th anniversary. This piano bears serial number 500,000.

== Digital innovations ==
Digital technology makes possible a vastly more sensitive and flexible version of the old player piano; for instance, the modern digital player piano can record as well as play. These pianos are often called &#x27;hybrid pianos&#x27;, as they have characteristics of both acoustic pianos (the piano sound is made by hammers on strings) and digital pianos (record/playback capability, as well as synthesizer and audio sound capability). Currently, five major manufacturers compete in this market; see links below.

Further afield, the stringless electronic keyboard and digital piano continue to make progress. Especially useful for the musician playing popular music, their portability and range of synthesized sounds has made them popular.

<text>Religious studies, also known as religiology or the study of religion, is the study of religion from a historical or scientific perspective. There is no consensus on what qualifies as &quot;religion&quot; and its definition is highly contested. It describes, compares, interprets, and explains religion, emphasizing empirical, historically based, and cross-cultural perspectives.

While theology attempts to understand the transcendent or supernatural according to traditional religious accounts, religious studies takes a more scientific and objective approach, independent of any particular religious viewpoint. Religious studies thus draws upon multiple academic disciplines and methodologies including anthropology, sociology, psychology, philosophy, and history of religion.

Religious studies originated in 19th-century Europe, when scholarly and historical analysis of the Bible had flourished, as Hindu and Buddhist sacred texts were first being translated into European languages. Early influential scholars included Friedrich Max Müller in England and Cornelis Petrus Tiele in the Netherlands. However, Max Müller was a philologist, not a professor of religion; Cornelis Tiele was. Today, religious studies is an academic discipline practiced by scholars worldwide. In its early years, it was known as &quot;comparative religion&quot; or the science of religion and, in the United States, there are those who today also know the field as the &quot;History of religion&quot; (associated with methodological traditions traced to the University of Chicago in general, and in particular Mircea Eliade, from the late 1950s through to the late 1980s).

The religious studies scholar Walter Capps described the purpose of the discipline as to provide &quot;training and practice ... in directing and conducting inquiry regarding the subject of religion&quot;. At the same time, Capps stated that its other purpose was to use &quot;prescribed modes and techniques of inquiry to make the subject of religion intelligible.&quot;
Religious studies scholar Robert A. Segal characterised the discipline as &quot;a subject matter&quot; that is &quot;open to many approaches&quot;, and thus it &quot;does not require either a distinctive method or a distinctive explanation to be worthy of disciplinary status.&quot;

Different scholars operating in the field have different interests and intentions; some for instance seek to defend religion, while others seek to explain it away, and others wish to use religion as an example with which to prove a theory of their own. Some scholars of religious studies are interested in primarily studying the religion to which they belong. Other scholars take a more unbiased approach and broadly examine the historical interrelationships among all major religious ideologies through history, focusing on shared similarities rather than differences. Scholars of religion have argued that a study of the subject is useful for individuals because it will provide them with knowledge that is pertinent in inter-personal and professional contexts within an increasingly globalized world. It has also been argued that studying religion is useful in appreciating and understanding sectarian tensions and religious violence.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;religion&quot; originated from the Latin noun , that was nominalized from one of three verbs: &#x27; (to turn to constantly/observe conscientiously); &#x27; (to bind oneself [back]); and &quot;&quot; (to choose again). Because of these three different potential meanings, an etymological analysis alone does not resolve the ambiguity of defining religion, since each verb points to a different understanding of what religion is. During the Middle Ages, the term &quot;religious&quot; was used as a noun to describe someone who had joined a monastic order (a &quot;religious&quot;).

==Defining &quot;religion&quot;==

Throughout the history of religious studies, there have been many attempts to define the term &quot;religion&quot;. Many of these have been &quot;monothetic&quot;, seeking to determine a key, essential element which all religions share, which can be used to define &quot;religion&quot; as a category, and which must be necessary in order for something to be classified as a &quot;religion&quot;. There are two forms of monothetic definition; the first are &quot;substantive&quot;, seeking to identify a specific core as being at the heart of religion, such as a belief in a God or gods, or an emphasis on power. The second are &quot;functional&quot;, seeking to define &quot;religion&quot; in terms of what it does for humans, for instance defining it by the argument that it exists to assuage fear of death, unite a community, or reinforce the control of one group over another. Other forms of definition are &quot;&quot;, producing a list of characteristics that are common to religion. In this definition there is no one characteristic that need to be common in every form of religion.

Causing further complications is the fact that there are various secular world views, such as nationalism and Marxism, which bear many of the same characteristics that are commonly associated with religion, but which rarely consider themselves to be religious.

Conversely, other scholars of religious studies have argued that the discipline should reject the term &quot;religion&quot; altogether and cease trying to define it. In this perspective, &quot;religion&quot; is argued to be a Western concept that has been forced upon other cultures in an act of intellectual imperialism. According to scholar of religion Russell T. McCutcheon, &quot;many of the peoples that we study by means of this category have no equivalent term or concept at all&quot;. There is, for instance, no word for &quot;religion&quot; in languages like Sanskrit.

==Intellectual foundation and background==
Religious studies became a field in its own right in The Netherlands by promulgating the so called &#x27;duplex ordo&#x27; law in 1876. Before that, several key intellectual figures explored religion from a variety of perspectives. One of these figures was the famous pragmatist William James. His 1902 Gifford lectures and book &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; examined religion from a psychological-philosophical perspective and is still influential today. His essay &quot;The Will to Believe&quot; defends the rationality of faith.

Max Weber studied religion from an economic perspective in &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; (1904–1905), his most famous work. As a major figure in sociology, he has no doubt influenced later sociologists of religion.
Émile Durkheim also holds continuing influence as one of the fathers of sociology. He explored Protestant and Catholic attitudes and doctrines regarding suicide in his work &quot;Suicide&quot;. In 1912, he published his most memorable work on religion, &quot;The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life&quot;.

==History==
Interest in the general study of religion dates back to at least Hecataeus of Miletus () and Herodotus (). Later, during the Middle Ages, Islamic scholars such as Ibn Hazm (d. 1064 CE) studied Persian, Jewish, Christian, and Indian religions, among others. The first history of religion was the &quot;Treatise on the Religious and Philosophical Sects&quot; (1127 CE), written by the Muslim scholar Muhammad al-Shahrastani. Peter the Venerable, also working in the twelfth century, studied Islam and made possible a Latin translation of the Qur&#x27;an.
Notwithstanding the long interest in the study of religion, the academic discipline Religious Studies is relatively new. Christopher Partridge notes that the &quot;first professorships were established as recently as the final quarter of the nineteenth century.&quot;

In the nineteenth century, the study of religion was done through the eyes of science. Max Müller was the first professor of comparative philology at Oxford University, a chair created especially for him. In his &quot;Introduction to the Science of Religion&quot; (1873) he wrote that it is &quot;the duty of those who have devoted their life to the study of the principal religions of the world in their original documents, and who value and reverence it in whatever form it may present itself, to take possession of this new territory in the name of true science.&quot;

Many of the key scholars who helped to establish the study of religion did not regard themselves as scholars of religious studies, but rather as theologians, philosophers, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and historians.

Partridge writes that &quot;by the second half of the twentieth century the study of religion had emerged as a prominent and important field of academic enquiry.&quot; He cites the growing distrust of the empiricism of the nineteenth century and the growing interest in non-Christian religions and spirituality coupled with convergence of the work of social scientists and that of scholars of religion as factors involved in the rise of Religious Studies.

One of the earliest academic institutions where Religious Studies was presented as a distinct subject was University College Ibadan, now the University of Ibadan, where Geoffrey Parrinder was appointed as lecturer in Religious Studies in 1949.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the term &quot;religious studies&quot; became common and interest in the field increased. New departments were founded and influential journals of religious studies were initiated (for example, &quot;Religious Studies and Religion&quot;). In the forward to &quot;Approaches to the Study of Religion&quot;, Ninian Smart wrote that &quot;in the English-speaking world [religious studies] basically dates from the 1960s, although before then there were such fields as &#x27;the comparative study of religion&#x27;, the &#x27;history of religion&#x27;, the &#x27;sociology of religion&#x27; and so on ...&quot;

In the 1980s, in both Britain and America, &quot;the decrease in student applications and diminishing resources in the 1980s led to cut backs affecting religious studies departments.&quot; (Partridge) Later in the decade, religious studies began to pick up as a result of integrating religious studies with other disciplines and forming programs of study that mixed the discipline with more utilitarian study.

Philosophy of religion uses philosophical tools to evaluate religious claims and doctrines. Western philosophy has traditionally been employed by English speaking scholars. (Some other cultures have their own philosophical traditions including Indian, Muslim, and Jewish.) Common issues considered by the (Western) philosophy of religion are the existence of God, belief and rationality, cosmology, and logical inferences of logical consistency from sacred texts.

Although philosophy has long been used in evaluation of religious claims (&quot;e.g.&quot; Augustine and Pelagius&#x27;s debate concerning original sin), the rise of scholasticism in the eleventh century, which represented &quot;the search for order in intellectual life&quot; (Russell, 170), more fully integrated the Western philosophical tradition (with the introduction of translations of Aristotle) in religious study.

==Academic disciplines within religious studies==
There is some amount of overlap between subcategories of religious studies and the discipline itself. Religious studies seeks to study religious phenomena as a whole, rather than be limited to the approaches of its subcategories.

===Anthropology of religion===
The anthropology of religion is principally concerned with the common basic human needs that religion fulfills. The cultural anthropology of religion is principally concerned with the cultural aspects of religion. Of primary concern to the cultural anthropologist of religions are rituals, beliefs, religious art, and practices of piety.

===Economics of religion===
Gallup surveys have found that the world&#x27;s poorest countries may be the most religious. Of those countries with average per-capita incomes under $2000, 95% reported that religion played an important role in their daily lives. This is contrasted by the average of 47% from the richest countries, with incomes over $25,000 (with the United States breaking the trend by reporting at 65%).
Social scientists have suggested that religion plays a functional role (helping people cope) in poorer nations.

===History of religion===
The history of religions is not concerned with theological claims apart from their historical significance. Some topics of this discipline are the historicity of religious figures, events, and the evolution of doctrinal matters. 

=== Interreligious studies ===
Interreligious studies is an emerging academic field that is focused on interactions among religious groups, including but not limited to interfaith dialogue. Journals and interdisiplinary organizing efforts grew especially in the 2010s. A pivotal anthology for the field is &quot;Interreligious/interfaith studies: Defining a new field&quot; by Eboo Patel, Jennifer Howe Peace, and Noah Silverman.

===Literary approaches===
There are many approaches to the study of sacred texts. One of these approaches is to interpret the text as a literary object. Metaphor, thematic elements, and the nature and motivations of the characters are of interest in this approach. An example of this approach is &quot;&quot;, by Jack Miles.

===Neurological approaches===
The temporal lobe has been of interest which has been termed the &quot;God center&quot; of the brain. (Ramachandran, ch. 9) Neurological findings in regard to religious experience is not a widely accepted discipline within religious studies. Scientific investigators have used a SPECTscanner to analyze the brain activity of both Christian contemplatives and Buddhist meditators, finding them to be quite similar.

===Origin of religion===
The &quot;origin of religion&quot; refers to the emergence of religious behavior in prehistory, before written records.

===Psychology of religion===
The psychology of religion is concerned with the psychological principles operative in religious communities and practitioners. William James&#x27;s The Varieties of Religious Experience analyzed personal experience as contrasted with the social phenomenon of religion. Some issues of concern to the psychologist of religions are the psychological nature of religious conversion, the making of religious decisions, religion and happiness, and the psychological factors in evaluating religious claims.

Sigmund Freud was another figure in the field of psychology and religion. He used his psychoanalytic theory to explain religious beliefs, practices, and rituals, in order to justify the role of religion in the development of human culture.

===Sociology of religion===
The sociology of religion concerns the dialectical relationship between religion and society; the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society. There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that it does not set out to assess the validity of religious beliefs, though the process of comparing multiple conflicting dogmas may require what Peter L. Berger has described as inherent &quot;methodological atheism&quot;. Whereas the sociology of religion broadly differs from theology in assuming the invalidity of the supernatural, theorists tend to acknowledge socio-cultural reification of religious practise.

The sociology of religion also deals with how religion impacts society regarding the positive and negatives of what happens when religion is mixed with society. Theorist such as Marx states that &quot;religion is the opium of the people&quot; - the idea that religion has become a way for people to deal with their problems. At least one comprehensive study refutes this idea. Research has found that secular democracies like France or Scandinavia outperform more theistic democracies on various measures of societal health. The authors explains, &quot;Pressing questions include the reasons, whether theistic or non-theistic, that the exceptionally wealthy U.S. is so inefficient that it is experiencing a much higher degree of societal distress than are less religious, less wealthy prosperous democracies. Conversely, how do the latter achieve superior societal health while having little in the way of the religious values or institutions?&quot;

=== Law and religion ===
Vogel reports that in the 1970s a new &quot;law and religion&quot; approach has progressively built its own contribution to religious studies. Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the &quot;Journal of Law and Religion&quot; first published that year and the &quot;Ecclesiastical Law Journal&quot; opened in 1999. Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. As of 2012, major Law and Religion organizations in the U.S. included 500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles. Scholars are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective. Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love. Common topics on interest include marriage and the family, and human rights. Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion interrelations in law and religion in the Muslim Middle East, and pagan Rome.

===Religion and cinema===
The earliest serious writing on the interface between religion and cinema appeared in the work of film critics like Jean Epstein in the 1920s.
The subject has grown in popularity with students and is cited as having particular relevance given the pervasiveness of film in modern culture. Approaches to the study of religion and film differ among scholars; functionalist approaches for instance view film as a site in which religion is manifested, while theological approaches examine film as a reflection of God&#x27;s presence in all things.

==Methodologies==
A number of methodologies are used in Religious Studies. Methodologies are hermeneutics, or interpretive models, that provide a structure for the analysis of religious phenomena.

===Phenomenology===

Phenomenology is &quot;arguably the most influential approach to the study of religion in the twentieth century.&quot; (Partridge) The term is first found in the title of the work of the influential philosopher of German Idealism, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, entitled &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;. Phenomenology had been practiced long before its being made explicit as a philosophical method by Edmund Husserl, who is considered to be its founder. In the context of Phenomenology of religion however, the term was first used by Pierre Daniel Chantepie de la Saussaye in his work &quot;Lehrbuch der Religiongeschichte&quot; (1887). Chantepie&#x27;s phenomenology catalogued observable characteristics of religion much like a zoologist would categorize animals or an entomologist would categorize insects.

In part due to Husserl&#x27;s influence, &quot;phenomenology&quot; came to &quot;refer to a method which is more complex and claims rather more for itself than did Chantepie’s mere cataloguing of facts.&quot; (Partridge) Husserl argued that the foundation of knowledge is consciousness. He recognized &quot;how easy it is for prior beliefs and interpretations to unconsciously influence one’s thinking, Husserl’s phenomenological method sought to shelve all these presuppositions and interpretations.&quot; (Partridge) Husserl introduced the term &quot;eidetic vision&quot; to describe the ability to observe without &quot;prior beliefs and interpretations&quot; influencing understanding and perception.

His other main conceptual contribution is the idea of the epoche: setting aside metaphysical questions and observing phenomena in and of themselves, without any bias or commitments on the part of the investigator. The epoche, also known as phenomenological reduction or bracketing, involves approaching a phenomenon or phenomena from a neutral standpoint, instead of with our own particular attitudes. In performing this reduction, whatever phenomenon or phenomena we approach are understood in themselves, rather than from our own perspectives. In the field of religious studies, a contemporary advocate of the phenomenological method is Ninian Smart. He suggests that we should perform the epoche as a means to engage in cross-cultural studies. In doing so, we can take the beliefs, symbols, rituals etc. of the other from within their own perspective, rather than imposing ours on them. Another earlier scholar who employs the phenomenological method for studying religion is Gerardus van der Leeuw. In his &quot;Religion in Essence and Manifestation&quot; (1933), he outlines what a phenomenology of religion should look like:

* Firstly, argues van der Leeuw, the student of religion needs to classify the religious phenomena into distinct categories: e.g. sacrifice, sacrament, sacred space, sacred time, sacred word, festivals, and myth.
* Secondly, scholars then need to interpolate the phenomena into their own lives. That is to say, they need to empathetically (Einfühlung) try and understand the religion from within. ... The life examined by the religious studies scholar, insists van der Leeuw, needs to &quot;acquire its place in the life of the student himself who should understand it out of his inner self.&quot;
* Thirdly, van der Leeuw stresses perhaps the fundamental phenomenological principle, namely epoch, the suspension of value-judgements and the adoption of a neutral stance.
* Fourthly, scholars needs to clarify any apparent structural relationships and make sense of the information. In so doing, they move towards a holistic understanding of how the various aspects of a religion relate and function together.
* Fifthly, this leads naturally to a stage at which &quot;all these activities, undertaken together and simultaneously, constitute genuine understanding [Verstehen]: the chaotic and obstinate &#x27;reality&#x27; thus becomes a manifestation, a revelation&quot; (eidetic vision).
* Sixthly, having thus attained this general grasp, there is a continual need to make sure that it tallies with the up-to-date research of other disciplines, such as archaeology, history, philology etc. For van der Leeuw, as for other phenomenologists, the continual checking of one’s results is crucial to the maintenance of scholarly objectivity. In order to avoid degeneration into fantasy, phenomenology must always feed on facts.
* Finally, having gone through the above six stages, the phenomenologist should be as close as anyone can be to an understanding of the &#x27;meaning&#x27; of the religious phenomena studied and be in a position to relate his understanding to others.
The subjectivity inherent to the phenomenological study of religion makes complete and comprehensive understanding highly difficult. However, phenomenologists aim to separate their formal study of religion from their own theological worldview and to eliminate, as far as possible, any personal biases (e.g., a Christian phenomenologist would avoid studying Hinduism through the lens of Christianity).

There are a number of both theoretical and methodological attitudes common among phenomenologists: 

* Phenomenologists tend to oppose the acceptance of unobservable matters and grand systems erected in speculative thinking;
* Phenomenologists tend to oppose naturalism (also called objectivism and positivism), which is the worldview growing from modern natural science and technology that has been spreading from Northern Europe since the Renaissance;
* Positively speaking, phenomenologists tend to justify cognition (and some also evaluation and action) with reference to what Edmund Husserl called Evidenz, which is awareness of a matter itself as disclosed in the most clear, distinct, and adequate way for something of its kind;
* Phenomenologists tend to believe that not only objects in the natural and cultural worlds, but also ideal objects, such as numbers, and even conscious life itself can be made evident and thus known;
* Phenomenologists tend to hold that inquiry ought to focus upon what might be called &quot;encountering&quot; as it is directed at objects and, correlatively, upon &quot;objects as they are encountered&quot; (this terminology is not widely shared, but the emphasis on a dual problematics and the reflective approach it requires is);
* Phenomenologists tend to recognize the role of description in universal, a priori, or &quot;eidetic&quot; terms as prior to explanation by means of causes, purposes, or grounds; and
* Phenomenologists tend to debate whether or not what Husserl calls the transcendental phenomenological epochê and reduction is useful or even possible.
Many scholars of religious studies argued that phenomenology was &quot;the distinctive method of the discipline&quot;.
In 2006, the phenomenologist of religion Thomas Ryba noted that this approach to the study of religion had &quot;entered a period of dormancy&quot;.
Phenomenological approaches were largely taxonomical, with Robert A. Segal stating that it amounted to &quot;no more than data gathering&quot; alongside &quot;the classification of the data gathered&quot;.

===Functionalism===
Functionalism, in regard to religious studies, is the analysis of religions and their various communities of adherents using the functions of particular religious phenomena to interpret the structure of religious communities and their beliefs. The approach was introduced by British anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown. A major criticism of functionalism is that it lends itself to teleological explanations. An example of a functionalist approach is understanding the dietary restrictions contained in the Pentateuch as having the function of promoting health or providing social identity (&quot;i.e.&quot; a sense of belonging though common practice).

===Lived religion===
Lived religion is the ethnographic and holistic framework for understanding the beliefs, practices, and everyday experiences of religious and spiritual persons in religious studies. The name lived religion comes from the French tradition of sociology of religion &quot;la religion vécue&quot;.

The concept of lived religion was popularized in the late twentieth century by religious study scholars like Robert A. Orsi and David Hall. The study of lived religion has come to include a wide range of subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious person does and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars.

==Religious studies and theology==
Western philosophy of religion, as the basic ancestor of modern religious studies, is differentiated from theology and the many Eastern philosophical traditions by generally being written from a third party perspective. The scholar need not be a believer. Theology stands in contrast to the philosophy of religion and religious studies in that, generally, the scholar is first and foremost a believer employing both logic &quot;and&quot; scripture as evidence. Theology according to this understanding fits with the definition which Anselm of Canterbury gave to it in the eleventh century, credo ut intelligam, or faith seeking understanding (literally, &quot;I believe so that I may understand&quot;). The theologian was traditionally seen as having the task of making intelligible, or clarifying, the religious commitments. However, many contemporary scholars of theology do not assume such a dichotomy. Instead, scholars now understand theology as a methodology in the study of religion, an approach that focuses on the religious content of any community they might study. This includes the study of their beliefs, literatures, stories and practices.

==Criticism==
Scholars, such as Jonathan Z. Smith, Timothy Fitzgerald, Talal Asad, Tomoko Masuzawa, Geoffrey A. Oddie, Richard E. King, and Russell T. McCutcheon, have criticized religious studies as a theological project which actually imposes views onto the people it aims to survey. Their areas of research overlap heavily with postcolonial studies.

In 1998, Jonathan Z. Smith wrote a chapter in &quot;Critical Terms for Religious Studies&quot; which traced the history of the term religion and argued that the contemporary understanding of world religions is a modern Christian and European term, with its roots in the European colonial expansion of the sixteenth century. Timothy Fitzgerald argued in 2000 that the comparative religion of the twentieth century in fact disguised a theological agenda which distorts the practices of societies outside the Western world and interprets them according to Christian norms.
Fitzgerald argues that this theological agenda has not been overcome by more recent efforts in religious studies to move beyond comparative religion.

<text>Baillon&#x27;s crake (Zapornia pusilla), also known as the marsh crake, is a small waterbird of the family Rallidae.

==Distribution==
Their breeding habitat is sedge beds in Europe, mainly in the east, and across the Palearctic. They used to breed in Great Britain up to the mid-19th century, but the western European population declined through drainage. There has been a recovery in north-western Europe in recent years, with the recolonisation of Germany and the Netherlands, and breeding suspected in Britain; an Irish record in 2012 was the first there since the 1850s. They nest in a dry location in wet sedge bogs, laying 4–8 eggs. This species is migratory, wintering in east Africa and south Asia.

It is also a resident breeder in Africa and Australasia. There is a single North American record of this species on Attu Island in September 2000.

===Subspecies===

There are at least five subspecies of Baillon&#x27;s crake:
* &quot;Zapornia pusilla affinis&quot; in New Zealand
* &quot;Zapornia pusilla palustris&quot; in Australia and New Guinea
* &quot;Zapornia pusilla mira&quot; in Borneo
* &quot;Zapornia pusilla intermedia&quot; in Africa
* &quot;Zapornia pusilla pusilla&quot; in Asia and other places

==Description==
They are in length, and are similar to the only slightly larger little crake. Baillon&#x27;s crake has a short straight bill, yellow or green without a red base. Adults have mainly brown upperparts with some white markings, and a blue-grey face and underparts. The rear flanks are barred black and white. They have green legs with long toes, and a short tail which is barred underneath.

Immature Baillon&#x27;s crakes are similar to the adults, but have extensively barred underparts. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails.
==Behaviour==
These birds probe with their bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and aquatic animals.

Baillon&#x27;s crakes are very secretive in the breeding season, and are then mostly heard rather than seen. They are then noisy birds, with a rattling call like that of the edible frog, or perhaps garganey. They can be easier to see on migration or when wintering.

==Taxonomy and nomenclature==
This bird is named after French naturalist Louis Antoine Francois Baillon. The names marsh crake and tiny crake have previously been used to refer to this species. &quot;pusillus&quot; is Latin for &quot;very small&quot;.

==Status==

===International===
Baillon&#x27;s crake is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

===Australia===
Baillon&#x27;s crakes are not listed as threatened on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. However, their conservation status varies from state to state within Australia. For example:
* Baillon&#x27;s crake is listed as threatened on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988). Under this Act, an &quot;Action Statement&quot; for the recovery and future management of this species has not yet been prepared.
* On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, Baillon&#x27;s crake is listed as vulnerable.

<text>Discrimination based on skin tone, also known as colorism or shadeism, is a form of prejudice and discrimination in which people of certain ethnic groups, or people who are perceived as belonging to a different-skinned racial group, are treated differently based on their different skin tone.

Colorism focuses on how racism is expressed in the psychology of a people and how it affects their concepts of beauty, wealth, and privilege. A key difference between racism and colorism is that while racism deals with the subjugation of one group by another or the belief in racial supremacy, colorism deals with in-group discrimination in addition to between-group discrimination.

Research has uncovered extensive evidence of discrimination based on skin color in criminal justice, business, the economy, housing, health care, the media, and politics in the United States and Europe. In addition, there has been research that evidently shows biases based on skin color in the educational system. Students of color are facing higher education costs and inequalities in advanced programs and are targeted by their teachers or peers from other marginalized groups. In addition to this issue being documented in the United States, lighter skin tones have been considered preferable in many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

Although less historically significant, prejudice within groups can also be applied toward lighter-skinned people. This is referred to as reverse colorism. 

== Worldwide ==
Racism affects almost every aspect of contemporary life. Research shows that ethnic minorities are offered fewer opportunities in higher education and employment, are subject to increased scrutiny by police, and are less likely to receive adequate care from physicians.

Several meta-analyses find extensive evidence of ethnic and racial discrimination in hiring in the North American and European labor markets. A 2016 meta-analysis of 738 correspondence tests in 43 separate studies done in OECD countries in 1990–2015 finds that there is extensive racial discrimination within both the European and North American hiring processes. Equivalent minority candidates need to send around 50% more applications than majority candidates to be invited for an interview. Recent research in the U.S. shows that socioeconomic and health inequality among African Americans along the color-continuum is often similar or even larger in magnitude than what exists between whites and African Americans.

Skin-whitening treatments and colorism inside of own ethnicity is more common in West and South parts of Africa. 

In some parts of Africa, people with lighter skin are thought to be more attractive and likely to find more success than those with darker skin tones. In some countries, this barrier has resulted in millions of women and men turning to skin-lightening treatments, many of which are harmful to the body.

Historically, skin lightening in Africa can be dated to European colonialism, where individuals with lighter skin received greater privilege than those of darker tones. European colonists in Rwanda established a color-based caste system that placed the Tutsi people above the Hutu people on the basis of their somewhat lighter skin, leading to the development of racialized political identities that had not existed in Rwanda before colonialism. The racial hierarchy and color ranking within colonized African nations left psychological effects on many of the darker-skinned individuals.

In the 21st century, 77% of Nigerian women, 52% of Senegalese women, and 25% of Malian women are using lightening products. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reports that in Ghana, &quot;When You Are Light-Skinned, You Earn More&quot;, and that &quot;[s]ome pregnant women take tablets in the hopes that it will lead their child to be born with fair skin. Some apply bleaching lotion [...] to their babies, in the hopes that it will improve their child&#x27;s chances.&quot;

==Asia==
=== East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia ===
In South Asia, a preference for lighter skin is prevalent. However, East Asian countries tend to embrace their natural skin tone.

The history of skin color discrimination in East Asia dates back to ancient times. In the ancient dynastic eras, being light-skinned implied wealth and nobility, because those privileged persons could stay indoors while servants had to labor outside.

The historical preference for light-skinned women in East Asia is quite different from more recent Western culture, where women of tan and brown complexions are preferred. Bonnie Adrian writes that American culture makes white women feel inferior for having pale complexions and reddish features, and that she risked skin cancer and wrinkles trying to darken her pale skin.

However, according to 21st-century research, women in China have recently asserted tan skin as the new female beauty ideal. According to Tai Wei Lim, Chinese women in the media now sport bronze complexions, and this is viewed as a reclamation of women&#x27;s autonomy from the fading Chinese patriarchy.

==== Japan ====

Hiroshi Wagatsuma writes in &quot;Daedalus&quot; that Japanese culture has long associated skin color with other physical characteristics that signify degrees of spiritual refinement or degrees of primitiveness.

In Japan, there is considerable discrimination and stigma against the skin color of white European women. Japanese women commonly state that white women&#x27;s skin is too pale, or that it is rough, wrinkled, or has too many spots.

==== Southeast Asia ====
In certain Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, a common beauty ideal is the &quot;Eurasian look&quot;. Locally known as the &quot;pan-Asian look&quot;, in Malaysia. The overuse of pan-Asian faces on billboards and on television screens has been a controversial issue in the country. The issue was highlighted in 2009 when Zainuddin Maidin, a Malaysian politician, called for the reduction of pan-Asian faces, which he claimed dominated TV and billboards, and instead to increase the number of Malay, Chinese, and Indian faces on local television.

In Indonesia, the &#x27;Eurasian look&#x27; can be traced to beauty ideals established by white male colonists from the Netherlands. White Dutch male colonists were enamored by the brown skin color and black hair of Indonesian women. They considered Eurasian Indonesian women&#x27;s darker complexions as more beautiful than the pale-skinned, blond-haired complexions of white Dutch women. The frequency at which young Dutch men married Indo women was considered an embarrassment for the conservative element of Dutch society. The legacy of this &#x27;Eurasian&#x27; beauty ideal continues to be reflected in local literature, as it was written in a popular novel that &quot;a golden colored skin is the greatest gift Allah can
bestow upon a woman&quot;, in reference to a blonde-haired girl who did not inherit her grandmother&#x27;s complexion.

Despite the controversy surrounding the preference for Malaysians who are of mixed Asian (Malay, Chinese, or Indian) and European descent and possess features such as fair skin, some other experts in the industry have said that the use of pan-Asian faces can be used to promote the racial diversity of Malaysians. As the Minister of Information had suggested in 1993, such faces can also be used to promote a product to a diverse racial demographic because of their mixed appearance.

==== Middle East ====
Skin lightening is a common practice in Jordan. The use of skin lightening products in the Middle East has been attributed to the desire for upword social mobility and attractiveness.

====India====

The implications of colorism in India have been apparent since the nation&#x27;s conception. The legacies of Mughal, Northern, and European colonial rule on the Indian subcontinent have influenced modern relations between light skin and power dynamics. Multiple studies have concluded that preference for lighter skin in India is historically linked to both the caste system and centuries of rule by peoples from other areas: Persia, Mughal territory, and Europe.

Colorism in India was also fed by the attitudes of Europeans, who favored lighter-skinned people for administrative positions and other prominent social positions, so power was conceptually intertwined with light skin. Rich Indians often tend to be light-skinned due to less exposure to the sun. Also, individuals were judged by their occupation. Being born into a lineage of farmers, for example, would typically make one unable to leave said lineage. Migration between occupations was rare, and though the caste system&#x27;s legality was altered in 1948, it is still influential and practiced in many parts of the country. As these factors generated the caste system, it grew to include both economic standing and societal positioning. Existing prejudices also influenced European officials. This sentiment remains.

Colorism has societal implications, many of which severely harm the socioeconomic mobility of darker-skinned Indians. These can manifest in gender stereotyping and regional discrimination. Studies of melanin index (MI) in individuals across regions show that there are variations in skin color, which contribute to the level of discrimination darker-skinned individuals face in these respective regions. In some regions of India, dark-skinned people are often seen as &quot;dirty&quot; and of lower status than lighter-skinned ones. A light complexion is equated with male and female beauty, racial superiority, and power and continues to have strong influences on marital prospects, employment, status, and income. Most of the girls were denied employment due to their darker skin tone. A few got jobs, but only as out-of-sight ground crew. According to Werdhani et al., persistent colorism is a legacy of the British colonization of India, during which Indian women were hyperfeminized and considered too demure for work by the colonizers, while Indian men were feminized and viewed as inferior to white men.

Other forms of colorism in India can be seen in the cosmetic industry, where skin bleaching creams are popular. In the Indian film and media industry, most hires are light-skinned, and actors and actresses are often photoshopped to look lighter. Skin lightening cosmetics are shown to have significant side effects, which increase in frequency over time. It is a burden on one&#x27;s mental health in a societal setting; users of skin creams, on average, remain dissatisfied with their complexion even after using the product. Unregulated products can contain harmful chemicals that can cause dermatitis, chemical burns, and, in severe cases, increase the likelihood of skin cancer and melanoma. As these mechanisms interplay with the presence of existent capitalistic institutions that control much of today&#x27;s world, the skin-lightening industry benefits this system through the exploitation of vulnerable individuals.

In the wake of the murder of George Floyd, an African-American man in the United States, which led to protests against racism worldwide, the debate about colorism and skin tone in India has been discussed in several media outlets. As part of the general critique, a big Indian matchmaking website, Shaadi.com, removed a filter where one could mark skin color preferences for their potential partner. Outside India, dark-skinned individuals and immigrants are typically treated with the same low level of social respect and acceptance, similar to the experiences they endure within their country.

==== Sri Lanka ====
Fair skin is a beauty ideal in contemporary Sri Lankan society but has its roots in ancient beauty ideals in the country. Fairness products and other products that include whitening agents are commonly sold in Sri Lanka and are popular among females. Fair-skinned actors and actresses feature prominently in Bollywood films and Korean dramas, both of which are widely popular and influential in Sri Lanka.

== The Caribbean ==
In Haiti, skin bleaching to lighten one’s skin, brown paper bag tests to verify one&#x27;s skin tone, and degradation of darker-complected Haitians as ugly are contemporary manifestations of colorism.

In the Dominican Republic, &quot;Blackness&quot; is often associated with the illegal Haitian migrant minority, who have a lower class status in the Dominican Republic. People who possess more African-like phenotypic features are often victims of discrimination, and are seen as foreigners.

== Europe ==

Native dark skinned African people living in the European Union have reported encountering discrimination based on skin color. Overall, reports of skin color discrimination did not vary by gender, with an equal percentage of men and women (38%) reporting skin color discrimination.

A 2019 report by Universities UK found that students&#x27; race and ethnicity significantly affect their degree outcomes. According to this report from 2017–18, there was a 13% gap between the likelihood of white students and Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students graduating with a first or 2:1 degree classification.

A 2023 University of Cambridge survey that featured the largest sample of black people in Britain found that 88% had reported racial discrimination at work, 79% believed the police unfairly targeted black people with stop and search powers, and 80% definitely or somewhat agreed that racial discrimination was the biggest barrier to academic attainment for young black students.

==Latin America==
=== Brazil ===

Brazil has the world&#x27;s largest population of African descent outside Africa. Racially mixed individuals with lighter skin generally have higher rates of social mobility than mixed-race people with darker skin. There is a disproportionately higher number of people among the mostly European-descended elites than there is among those elites whose members are of visible African descent. There are large health, education, and income disparities between the races in Brazil. A recent study finds that skin color is a stronger predictor of social inequality in Brazil than &#x27;race&#x27; (i.e., the &#x27;race-color&#x27; categories used on the Brazilian census). This highlights the fact that socially perceived skin color and &#x27;race&#x27; are not the same thing. Although browns/mixeds and blacks comprise more than 50 percent of the population, they comprise less than 25 percent of all of the elected politicians.

A 2016 study, using twins as a control for neighborhood and family characteristics, found that the nonwhite twin is disadvantaged in the educational system. A 2015 study on racial bias in teacher evaluations in Brazil found that Brazilian math teachers gave better grading assessments of white students than equally proficient and equivalently well-behaved black students.

A 2018 paper found that discriminatory hiring and retention policies accounted for 6–8% of the overall racial wage gap.

=== Chile ===
In Chile, there is a wide range of diversity from other cultures and ethnic backgrounds. The diversity in Chile sees colorism through social-economic status, accommodating the preexisting notion that darker skin complexions are less valued. A 2016 study found that Chilean schoolteachers expected less from their dark-skinned students (&quot;morenos&quot;) than they expected from their light-skinned students (&quot;blancos&quot;). Even the differences between being dark and being tanned carry different types of status: being tanned means that people have enough money to go to the beach and buy tanning products. Due to the history of colonization, being darker-skinned (and likely descended from enslaved Africans) means that people are automatically considered members of the lower classes. Current studies have revealed that many Chileans want to have lighter pigmentation. Whiteness is also associated with economic standing; a mixed-race person may be considered &quot;white&quot; if they are obviously educated and successful.

=== Mexico ===
A 2017 study revealed a 45% gap in educational achievement between the darkest- and lightest-skinned White Mexicans and that wealth in the country similarly correlated to skin color.

Colorism in Mexico is an ongoing problem that strongly affects people of darker skin tones there. Color can affect Mexican citizens&#x27; daily lives, their ability to get jobs, and their basic self-esteem. Mexicans have a long history of ancestry from sources other than indigenous peoples: Spanish, African, German, and other Europeans. The number of Mexicans who identify as mixed race increased from 3 million in 2010 to more than 20 million in 2020 as more individuals began to acknowledge mixed race. Skin color for Mexicans can range from white to black; more than half of Mexican citizens identify as mestizo or mixed race.

A study by Vanderbilt University found that darker skin is strongly associated with decreased wealth and less education. According to Mexico&#x27;s National Statistics and Geography Institute, the darker the skin tone, the less upward mobility a Mexican citizen may have. This study revealed that Mexicans with the darkest skin tones were the least likely to have finished elementary school. Simultaneously, those with lighter skin tones were more likely to have a university degree. Some of these differences are also attributed to economic differences between people&#x27;s families of origin, which create gaps between groups.

These findings also indicate that skin tone appears to be associated with educational achievement. Mexicans with the lightest skin tones complete an average of 11 years of schooling, while dark-skinned Mexicans finish an average of 5.3 years of school. A maximal change in skin tone, from lightest to darkest, is associated with a decrease of almost 6 years of schooling, a 51.8% reduction in education. Lighter-skinned Mexicans were more likely to hold positions of power, while those with darker skin tones were more likely to have positions that required a lower level of qualifications. According to a study by Vanderbilt University, the average Mexican household income was about US$193 a month, while lighter-toned citizens reported an average income of US$220 a month. Darker-skinned citizens earned almost 42% less than their white counterparts: US$137 a month. Overall, Mexican populations with lighter skin fall into the highest wealth brackets in Mexico, while those with darker skin fall the lowest.

The average Mexican is located within the 3rd and 4th wealth quintiles, while Mexicans with darker skin tones are averaged below the 2nd wealth quintile. A maximal change in skin tone in Mexico, from lightest to darkest, is associated with a 51.5% decrease in material wealth. This study also found that while 2.5 percent of white Mexicans surveyed by Vanderbilt&#x27;s pollsters don&#x27;t have running water, upward of 11 percent of dark-skinned citizens said they lack this basic necessity. Similarly, 7.5 percent of white Mexicans reported lacking an in-home bathroom, while 20 percent of dark-skinned Mexicans lacked such convenience. Researchers concluded that not only does the color of one&#x27;s skin in Mexico negatively predict economic and educational outcomes, but it is also among the strongest factors found in this study.

Mexico had traditionally celebrated its &quot;&quot;raza mestiza&quot;, or mixed-race society. For example, in 2017, President Enrique Peña Nieto declared &quot;el mestizaje&quot;&quot; (mixed race) &quot;the future of humanity.&quot; Although more than half of Mexico&#x27;s population identifies as mixed race, race and skin color have a greater effect on Mexicans&#x27; human development and capital accumulation than any other variable. Vanderbilt&#x27;s results show that the skin color gap in Mexico is two times the achievement gap between northern and southern Mexicans, something that is often referred to in Mexico. Vanderbilt&#x27;s study shows that the skin color gap is five times greater than the urban/rural divide in Mexico. It has a significantly greater effect on wealth and education than ethnicity (indigenous versus white or mixed) does.

When Aeromexico recruited new employees in 2013, they specified &quot;nadie moreno&quot;, or no dark-skinned people. This type of colorism and racism in Mexico is often ignored or explained by cultural divides. Because Mexico consists of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic diversity, many Mexicans argue that darker-skinned citizens tend to live in historically disadvantaged and highly indigenous areas.

==United States==
===History===

European colonizers created a racial hierarchy and a race-based ideology, which led to the formation of a structural system of oppression that benefited individuals of European descent over individuals of African descent. Biological differences in skin color were used to justify the enslavement and oppression of Africans and Native Americans, leading to the development of a social hierarchy that placed people of European descent at the top and people of African descent at the bottom. Enslaved people with lighter complexions (usually stemming from the sexual assault of enslaved African women) were allowed to perform less strenuous tasks, like domestic duties, while darker-skinned enslaved people were forced to engage in hard labor, which they usually performed outdoors.

African-Americans with greater European ancestry and a lighter skin color were considered smarter than and therefore superior to their darker-skinned counterparts. As a result, they were given greater opportunities for education and the acquisition of land and property. Colorism was a device used by European colonists to create division between enslaved Africans and further the idea that being as close to white as possible was the ideal image. One of the first forms of colorism was slave owners deciding that only light-skinned enslaved people would work in the house while the darker-skinned ones were subjected to the harsh conditions of the fields. This practice led to a clear division between the slaves, undermining their solidarity against the slave owners.

A variety of specific cutoff tests for skin color emerged; the most famous one was the brown paper bag test. If people&#x27;s skins were darker than the color of a brown paper bag, they were considered &quot;too dark&quot;. While the origin of this test is unclear, it is best attested to in 20th-century black culture. During the time when African Americans were forced into slavery, slave owners would use the &quot;paper bag test&quot;, which compared their skin color to a paper bag, to distinguish whether their complexion was too dark to work inside the house. African Americans&#x27; desire for lighter complexions and European features goes back to slavery. Enslaved people with lighter complexions would have the privilege of working indoors, while enslaved people with darker skin were required to work outside in the fields. The complexions of African American slaves reflected how they were treated and the severity of their punishments if they did not comply with the lifestyle that they were forced into. The access to and resources to purchase skincare products or services impacted the notions of colorism among African American women, since enslaved and impoverished black women were more limited in their grooming, which affected the way they were treated by their masters. For example, light-skinned black women were marketed as &quot;Negroes fit for domestic service&quot; in their masters&#x27; homes.

In addition to the bag test, the comb test and the door test were also used. The comb test was used to measure the kinkiness of a person&#x27;s hair. The objective was for the comb to be able to pass through the hair without stopping. The door test was popular in some African American clubs and churches. The people who were in charge of those clubs and churches would paint their doors a certain shade of brown, similar to the brown paper bag test, and if people&#x27;s skins were darker than the color of the doors, they were not admitted into the establishments. These tests were used to measure what level of &quot;blackness&quot; was and was not acceptable in the world. Due to lighter-skinned slaves being allowed to work in the house, they were more likely to be educated than darker slaves were. Hence the stereotype that dark people are stupid and ignorant. Scholars predict that in the future, the preferred color of beauty will not be black or white but mixed. Scholars also predict that the United States will adopt a &quot;multicultural matrix&quot;, which will help bridge the racial gap in efforts to achieve racial harmony, termed by some a &quot;browning of America&quot;. The matrix has four components: the mixed race will help fix racial issues; it serves as a sign of racial progress; it suggests that racism is a thing; and it also suggests that the focus on race is racist due to the lack of racial neutrality. At the same time, some Americans view this &quot;browning&quot; as a sort of demographic replacement, which has led to anxiety among some white Americans who feel that their identity and culture are under attack and will be displaced without changes to the US immigration system. Eric Peter Kaufmann explored these views among American whites and internationally in the 2018 book &quot;Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities&quot;.

A parallel as well as an opposite critique of this theory is made by black scholars, who state that racial neutrality will not eliminate discrimination based on skin color as long as some races continue to be negatively perceived and unfairly treated. As such, racial &quot;browning&quot; would just be another way to erase dark skin without correcting the bad way in which it is perceived. From this point of view, racial harmonization is not a valid response to racism at all. In his 2008 book &quot;The Browning of America and the Evasion of Social Justice&quot;, Ronald R. Sundstrom writes:

Several authors have noted that a kind of reverse-colorism began to form within the African-American community after the end of slavery. Lighter-skinned African-Americans were seen by some darker-skinned people as being inauthentic, privileged, or even &quot;poisoned&quot; by whiteness. According to Greg Carter, this attitude was held by many prominent black nationalists, including W.E.B. Du Bois and Marcus Garvey. Ibram X. Kendi wrote that colorism is a &quot;collection of racist policies [...] substantiated by racist ideas about Light and Dark people&quot;. Ronald Hall argues that a form of reverse-colorism may have emerged in the Northern Mariana Islands, where mixed-indigenous ethnic groups have sometimes been rejected as inauthentic or even stigmatized as degenerate, and where varying shades of brown skin have been valued over light skin.

In Japan, reverse colorism has acted against white women, whose complexions are stigmatized as too pale or &quot;spotted&quot; in comparison to local Asian women. In Southeast Asia, beauty ideals created by Dutch white male colonists placed brown-skinned Asian women above white women in the female beauty standard, leading to the lower socioeconomic status of blond, light-skinned women in Indonesia.

According to the Pew Research Center, 62% of US Latinos say that having a darker skin color affects their ability to get ahead. This study also showed that 59% of Latinos say that having a lighter skin color helps Hispanic people get ahead. 57% say that discrimination based on skin color towards Latinos is a &quot;very big problem&quot; in the US. Another survey by the Pew Research Center shows that Hispanics with darker skin color are more likely to have experienced at least one instance of discrimination than those with lighter skin color. This study also showed that 42% of Hispanics with darker skin have experienced discrimination or were treated with prejudice by someone who is not Hispanic, while only 29% of those with lighter skin say the same happened to them. Additionally, 41% of Hispanics with darker skin say they have experienced discrimination by someone who is Hispanic, while only 25% of those with lighter skin color say they have experienced the same. According to these findings, those with darker skin and lighter skin alike feel that skin color affects opportunities and life in the US. For example, 62% of darker-skinned Latinos feel that skin color shapes daily life, while 57% of lighter-skinned Latinos feel the same. Colorism can also affect how Hispanic Americans relate to one another. According to the Pew study, nearly half of Hispanic adults say they have often or sometimes heard a Hispanic friend or family member make comments about other Hispanics that might be considered racist or racially insensitive. About half of Latinos feel that discrimination based on race or skin color is a very big problem.

=== Business ===
A 2014 meta-analysis of racial discrimination in product markets found extensive evidence of minority applicants being quoted higher prices for products. A 1995 study found that car dealers &quot;quoted significantly lower prices to white males than to black or female test buyers using identical, scripted bargaining strategies.&quot; A 2013 study found that eBay sellers of iPods received 21 percent more offers if a white hand held the iPod in the photo than a black hand.

A 2014 study in the &quot;Journal of Economic Growth&quot; found that anti-black violence and terrorism, as well as segregation laws, reduced the economic activity and innovation of African Americans.

Today, the &quot;thick&quot; black female body is celebrated within the black community, but according to critical race theorist Gentles-Peart, this does not negate the persistence of white colonialist views that presented black women&#x27;s stereotypically &quot;thicker&quot; bodies as unattractive.

African-Americans have historically faced discrimination in terms of getting access to credit. A 2020 audit study of 17 banks found that black business owners who sought loans under the Paycheck Protection Program got substantially worse treatment than white business owners. Bus drivers engaged in substantial discrimination against black passengers relative to white passengers.

=== Technology ===
In 2018, a study was published by Dr. Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru evaluating the accuracy of several facial recognition technologies in identifying male and female individuals of varying skin tones. They based the skin tone differences in people included in the dataset on the Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, a standard dermatological system for skin tone classification. After their evaluation of three commercially available facial recognition softwares, Buolamwini and Gebru found that all three products performed better on lighter faces (Skin Types I-III) than darker faces (Skin Types IV-VI). In their evaluation, Microsoft&#x27;s software had the least discrepancy, with an error rate of 12.9% for darker skinned people and 0.7% for fairer individuals. In contrast, IBM&#x27;s software performed the worst with an identification error rate of 22.4%, which is &quot;nearly 7 times higher than the IBM error rate on lighter faces&quot;. Buolamwini and Gebru also note that the Fitzpatrick Skin Type system is &quot;skewed towards lighter skin and has three categories that can be applied to people perceived as White&quot;, implying that the superior performance of facial recognition software on lighter skin tones covers a smaller variety of skin tones than the inferior coverage of the darker skin tones.

===Criminal justice===
Research suggests that police practices such as racial profiling, over-policing in areas that are populated by minorities, and in-group bias may all result in disproportionately high numbers of racial minorities among crime suspects. Research also suggests that there is discrimination in the judicial system, which contributes to a higher number of convictions and unfavorable sentencing for racial minorities. Further research indicates that even when controlling for income and all other factors, children from father-absent families (mother only, mother-stepfather, and relatives/other) were much more likely to be incarcerated. The disproportionate single-parent households of black youths to those in white family structures is 64% to 24% as of 2019.

====Policing, arrests, and surveillance====
A 2019 study, which made use of a dataset of the racial makeup of every U.S. sheriff over a 25-year period, found that &quot;the ratio of Black-to-White arrests is significantly higher under White sheriffs&quot; and that the effects appear to be &quot;driven by arrests for less-serious offenses and by targeting Black crime types.&quot;

In-group bias has also been observed when it comes to traffic citations, as black and white cops are more likely to cite out-groups.

A 2019 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that facial-recognition systems were substantially more likely to misidentify the faces of racial minorities. Some ethnic groups, such as Asian-Americans and African-Americans, were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white men.

A 2018 study in the journal &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; found that tall young black men are especially likely to receive unjustified attention by law enforcement. The authors furthermore found a &quot;causal link between perceptions of height and perceptions of threat for Black men, particularly for perceivers who endorse stereotypes that Black people are more threatening than White people.&quot;

Analysis of more than 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina showed that blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be pulled over by police for traffic stops and that blacks were more likely to be searched following the stop. There was no significant difference in the likelihood that Hispanics would be pulled over, but Hispanics were much more likely to be searched following a traffic stop than whites. When the study controlled for searches in high-crime areas, it still found that police disproportionately targeted black individuals. These racial disparities were particularly pronounced for young men. The study found that whites who were searched were more likely to carry contraband than blacks and Hispanics. A 2020 study in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; found that black drivers were stopped more often than white drivers and that the threshold by which police decided to search black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that for whites (judging by the rate at which contraband was found in searches). A 2021 study in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; found similar results. A 2021 study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; found that minorities were significantly less likely to receive discounts on their traffic tickets than white drivers; the study estimated that 42% of Florida Highway Patrol officers practiced racial discrimination.

A 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union found that blacks were &quot;3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession&quot;, even though &quot;blacks and whites use drugs, including marijuana, at similar rates.&quot;

====Police killings and use of force====

Racism is also present in policing. For instance, the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;stop and search&quot; laws have been disproportionately used against black people, specifically black men. Excessive force against black people is also common in the United States. Police in the United States disproportionately killed unarmed black Americans compared to unarmed white Americans. These discrepancies led to the creation of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. The movement began in the US in 2012, after the killing of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old unarmed African-American, by George Zimmerman. Zimmerman claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder at trial. The movement skyrocketed after many high-profile killings of unarmed African Americans by the police, including the murder of George Floyd. However, BLM also faces criticism, and the &quot;All Lives Matter&quot; (ALM) movement emerged as a response. Thus, there is an ongoing debate on the motifs of the ALM. Former US President Donald Trump and some other Republicans declared the BLM as racist and the ALM as more inclusive and color-blind.

A 2016 study by Roland G. Fryer, Jr., of the National Bureau of Economic Research () found that while overall &quot;blacks are 21 percent more likely than whites to be involved in an interaction with police in which at least a weapon is drawn&quot; and that in the raw data from New York City&#x27;s Stop and Frisk program, &quot;blacks and Hispanics are more than fifty percent more likely to have an interaction with police which involves any use of force&quot; after &quot;[p]artitioning the data in myriad ways, we find no evidence of racial discrimination in officer-involved shootings.&quot; The study did find bias against blacks and Hispanics in non-lethal and less-extreme lethal violence, stating that &quot;as the intensity of force increases (e.g. handcuffing civilians without arrest, drawing or pointing a weapon, or using pepper spray or a baton), the probability that any civilian is subjected to such treatment is small, but the racial difference remains surprisingly constant&quot;, and noting that &quot;[u]ntil recently, data on officer-involved shootings were extremely rare and contained little information on the details surrounding an incident&quot;.

After the NBER study was published in the peer reviewed &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot;, a comment on it by Steven Durlauf and Nobel Prize in Economics recipient James Heckman of the Harris School of Public Policy Studies at the University of Chicago said, &quot;[i]n our judgment, this paper does &quot;not&quot; establish credible evidence on the presence or absence of discrimination against African Americans in police shootings.&quot; The NBER study&#x27;s author, Roland G. Fryer Jr., responded by saying Durlauf and Heckman erroneously claim that his sample is &quot;based on stops.&quot; Further, he states that the &quot;vast majority of the data [...] are gleaned from 911 calls for service in which a civilian requests police presence.&quot;

A 2018 study in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; found the mortality rate by police per 100,000 was 1.9 to 2.4 for black men, 0.8 to 1.2 for Hispanic men, and 0.6 to 0.7 for white men. Reports by the Department of Justice have also found that police in Baltimore, Maryland, and Ferguson, Missouri, systemically stop, search (in some cases, strip-search), and harass black residents. A January 2017 report by the DOJ concluded that the Chicago Police Department had &quot;unconstitutionally engaged in a pattern of excessive and deadly force&quot;, and an independent task force created by the mayor of Chicago stated that police &quot;have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color.&quot; A 2018 study found that minorities were disproportionately killed by police, but that white officers were no more likely to use lethal force on minorities than minority officers. A 2019 study in the &quot;Journal of Politics&quot; found that police officers were more likely to use lethal force on blacks, but that this was &quot;most likely driven by higher rates of police contact among African Americans rather than racial differences in the circumstances of the interaction and officer bias in the application of lethal force.&quot;

A 2019 study in the journal &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; found that blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives are more likely to be killed by police than whites, and that Latino men are more likely to be killed than white men. According to the study, &quot;for young men of color, police use of force is among the leading causes of death.&quot; A separate &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; (&quot;PNAS&quot;) study found that there were no racial disparities in police shootings by white police; the findings of the study were disputed by Princeton University scholars, who argued that the study&#x27;s method and dataset made it impossible for the authors to reach that conclusion. The authors of the original &quot;PNAS&quot; study corrected their article following the criticism by the Princeton scholars. A study by Texas A&amp;M University economists, which rectified some problems of selection bias identified in the literature above, found that white police officers were more likely to use force and guns than black police, and that white officers were five times as likely to use gun force in predominantly black neighborhoods. A 2020 &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; study estimated that 39% of uses of force by police against blacks and Hispanics in New York City were racially discriminatory.

====Charging decisions====
A 2018 study in the &quot;Journal of Empirical Legal Studies&quot; found that law enforcement officers in Texas who could charge shoplifters with two types of crimes (one more serious, one less so) due to a vaguely worded statute were more likely to charge blacks and Hispanics with the more serious crime.

A 2017 report by the Marshall Project found that killings of black men by whites were far more likely to be deemed &quot;justifiable&quot; than killings by any other combination of races.

====Legal representation, bail decisions, trials, and convictions====
A 2019 audit study found that lawyers are less likely to take on clients with black-sounding names than white-sounding names.

A 2018 study in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; found that bail judges in Miami and Philadelphia were racially biased against black defendants, as white defendants had higher rates of pretrial misconduct than black defendants. A 2022 study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; found that New York City judges engaged in racial discrimination against black defendants in bail decisions.

A 2012 study found that &quot;(i) juries formed from all-white jury pools convict black defendants significantly (16 percentage points) more often than white defendants, and (ii) this gap in conviction rates is entirely eliminated when the jury pool includes at least one black member.&quot;

A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research experiment found that law students, economics students, and practicing lawyers who watched 3D virtual reality videos of court trials (where the researchers altered the race of the defendants) showed a racial bias against minorities.

DNA exonerations in rape cases strongly suggest that the wrongful conviction rate is higher for black convicts than white convicts.

====Sentencing====
Research has found evidence of in-group bias, where &quot;black (white) juveniles who are randomly assigned to black (white) judges are more likely to get incarcerated (as opposed to being placed on probation), and they receive longer sentences.&quot;

A 2018 study in the &quot;American Economic Journal: Applied Economics&quot; found that judges gave longer sentences, in particular to black defendants, after their favorite team lost a home game.

A 2014 study in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; found that 9% of the black-white gap in sentencing could not be accounted for. The elimination of unexplained sentencing disparities would reduce &quot;the steady-state level of black men in federal prison by 8,000–11,000 men [out of the black male prison population of 95,000] and save $230–$320 million per year in direct costs.&quot; The majority of the unexplained sentencing disparity appears to occur at the point when prosecutors decide to bring charges carrying &quot;mandatory minimum&quot; sentences. A 2018 paper by Alma Cohen and Crystal Yang of Harvard Law School found that &quot;Republican-appointed judges give substantially longer prison sentences to black offenders versus observably similar non-black offenders compared to Democratic-appointed judges within the same district court.&quot;

In criminal sentencing, medium- to dark-skinned African Americans are likely to receive sentences 2.6 years longer than those of whites or light-skinned African Americans. When a white victim is involved, those with more &quot;black&quot; features are likely to receive a much more severe punishment.

A 2016 report by the &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot; found that Florida judges sentence black defendants to far longer prison sentences than whites with the same background. For the same drug possession crimes, blacks were sentenced to double the time of whites. Blacks were given longer sentences in 60 percent of felony cases, 68 percent of the most serious first-degree crimes, 45 percent of burglary cases, and 30 percent of battery cases. For third-degree felonies (the least serious types of felonies in Florida), white judges sentenced blacks to twenty percent more time than whites, whereas black judges gave more balanced sentences.

A 2017 report by the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) found, &quot;after controlling for a wide variety of sentencing factors&quot; (such as age, education, citizenship, weapon possession, and prior criminal history), that &quot;Black male offenders received sentences on average 19.1 percent longer than similarly situated White male offenders&quot;.

A 2014 study on the application of the death penalty in Connecticut over the period 1973–2007 found &quot;that minority defendants who kill white victims are capitally charged at substantially higher rates than minority defendants who kill minorities... There is also strong and statistically significant evidence that minority defendants who kill whites are more likely to end up with capital sentences than comparable cases with white defendants.&quot;

====Prison system, parole, and pardons====
A 2016 analysis by the &quot;New York Times&quot; found that &quot;tens of thousands of disciplinary cases against inmates in 2015, hundreds of pages of internal reports and three years of parole decisions found that racial disparities were embedded in the prison experience in New York.&quot; Blacks and Latinos were sent more frequently to solitary and held there for longer durations than whites. The &quot;New York Times&quot; analysis found that the disparities were greatest for violations where the prison guards had much discretion, such as disobeying orders, but smaller for violations that required physical evidence, such as possessing contraband.

According to a 2011 &quot;ProPublica&quot; analysis, &quot;whites are nearly four times as likely as minorities to win a pardon, even when the type of crime and severity of sentence are taken into account.&quot;

=== Education ===
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that integrated, equal schools should be accessible to all children unbiased to skin color. Currently, in the United States, not all state-funded schools are equally funded. Schools are funded by &quot;federal, state, and local governments&quot;, while &quot;states play a large and increasing role in education funding.&quot; &quot;Property taxes support most of the funding that the local government provides for education.&quot; Schools in lower-income areas get less funding than schools in higher-income areas because all funding for education is based on property taxes. The U.S. Department of Education reports that &quot;many high-poverty schools receive less than their fair share of state and local funding, leaving students in high-poverty schools with fewer resources than schools which are attended by their wealthier peers.&quot; The U.S. Department of Education also says this fact affects &quot;more than 40% of low-income schools&quot;. Children of color are much more likely to suffer from poverty than white children. Furthermore, an article from 2015 informs that since black students finance their education through debt, the chances of them receiving a college degree worsen. And because education does not lead to economic equality for black employees, the excessive deficit that black students are taking on to pay for their education is widening the wealth disparity between races. The statistics from the article show the average white college graduate has more than seven times as much wealth as the average black graduate. Therefore, students of color are more likely to have lower educational outcomes because of the wealth differences.

A 2015 study that used correspondence tests &quot;found that when they are considering requests from prospective students who are seeking mentoring in the future, faculty were significantly more responsive to White males than they were to all other categories of students, collectively, particularly in higher-paying disciplines and private institutions.&quot; Through affirmative action, elite colleges consider a broader range of experiences for minority applicants.

A 2016 study in the journal &quot;PNAS&quot; found that blacks and Hispanics were systemically underrepresented in education programs for gifted children where teachers and parents referred students to those programs; when a universal screening program based on IQ was used to refer students, the disparity was significantly reduced. An article from 2000 mentions the inequalities students of color have when accessing advanced classes or programs for gifted students. The authors analyzed how schools that serve minorities offer less advanced courses than schools that serve large white populations of students. Thus, these statistics show how this issue is ongoing and has not been minimized.

The phrase &quot;brown paper bag test&quot;, or paper bag party, along with the &quot;ruler test&quot;, refers to a ritual that was once done by certain African-American sororities and fraternities that would not let anyone into the group if his or her skin was darker than a brown paper bag. Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;School Daze&quot; satirized this practice at historically black colleges and universities. Along with the &quot;paper bag test&quot;, guidelines for acceptance among the lighter ranks included the &quot;comb test&quot; and the &quot;pencil test&quot;, which tested the coarseness of one&#x27;s hair, and the &quot;flashlight test&quot;, which tested a person&#x27;s profile in order to make sure that their features measured up or were close enough to those of the Caucasian race.

A 2013 study used spectrophotometer readings to quantify the skin color of respondents. White women experience discrimination in education, with those women with darker skin graduating from college at lower rates than those with lighter skin. This precise and repeatable test of skin color revealed that white women experience skin color discrimination in education at levels that are consistent with the levels of skin color discrimination experienced by African-Americans. White men are not affected in this way.

=== Health ===
A 2019 review of the literature in the &quot;Annual Review of Public Health&quot; found that structural racism, cultural racism, and individual-level discrimination are &quot;a fundamental cause of adverse health outcomes for racial/ethnic minorities and racial/ethnic inequities in health.&quot; A 2020 study found that black healthcare workers experience racial discrimination, which increases racial harassment and firing rates while decreasing promotional opportunities.

A 2020 interview study found that black technicians were treated differently compared to white technicians. When performing a simple procedure, patients were more likely to object to a black technician&#x27;s work and question their credentials than to a white technician&#x27;s.

A 1999 study found that doctors treat black and white patients differently, even when their medical files were statistically identical. When shown patient histories and asked to make judgments about heart disease, the doctors were much less likely to recommend cardiac catheterization (a helpful procedure) to black patients. A 2015 study found that pediatricians were more likely to undertreat appendicitis pain in black children than white children. A 2017 study found that medical staff treating anterior cruciate ligament injuries perceived black collegiate athletes as having higher pain tolerance than white athletes. A study by University of Toronto and Ohio State University economists found substantial evidence of racial discrimination against black veterans in terms of medical treatment and awarding of disability pensions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; the discrimination was substantial enough to account for nearly the entire black-white mortality gap in the period. A 2019 study in &quot;Science&quot; found that one widely used algorithm to assess health risks falsely concluded that &quot;Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients&quot;, thus leading health care providers to provide lower levels of care for black patients. A 2020 study found that &quot;when Black newborns are cared for by Black physicians, the mortality penalty they suffer, as compared with White infants, is halved.&quot;

A 2020 study published in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; examined racial bias in pulse oximetry measurement. Pulse oximeters are a medical device that is commonly attached to a patient&#x27;s finger and uses a sensor to measure light that has traveled through the skin to determine oxygen saturation in blood. Oxygen saturation is an important vital that quantifies of the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream. The purpose of the study was to identify cases of occult hypoxemia, which the study defined as cases where a subject had &quot;an arterial oxygen saturation of &lt;88% despite an oxygen saturation of 92 to 96% on pulse oximetry&quot;. It is important to note that there are different forms of medical intervention recommended at oxygen saturation levels at &lt;88% and 92%, and below 90% organs such as the brain, heart, and lungs become at risk for organ damage. The study found that &quot;Black patients had nearly three times the frequency of occult hypoxemia that was not detected by pulse oximetry as White patients&quot;. Pulse Ox devices are used frequently for medical decision making, potentially resulting in disparate outcomes for darker and lighter skin patients when choices are made based on pulse oximeters for supplemental oxygen (especially when hospitals are overwhelmed, like during the COVID-19 pandemic).

A 2018 ProPublica analysis found that African Americans and Native Americans were underrepresented in clinical trials of new drugs. Fewer than 5% of patients were African-American, even though they make up 13.4% of the total US population. African-Americans were even underrepresented in trials involving drugs intended for diseases that disproportionately affect African-Americans. As a result, African-Americans who have exhausted all other treatments have weaker access to experimental treatments.

Studies have argued that there are racial disparities in how the media and politicians act when they are faced with cases of drug addiction in which the victims are primarily black rather than white, citing the examples of how society responded differently to the crack epidemic than it responded to the opioid epidemic.

The biases that underrepresentation of dark skin tone images creates ultimately exacerbate disparities in dermatologic outcomes between patient populations with light and dark skin tones. Furthermore, racial discrimination between healthcare workers is also important due to its linkage to mental health and job satisfaction.

=== Housing and land ===

A 2014 meta-analysis found extensive evidence of racial discrimination in the American housing market. Minority applicants for housing needed to make many more inquiries to view properties. Geographical steering of African-Americans in US housing remains significant. A 2003 study found &quot;evidence that agents interpret an initial housing request as an indication of a customer&#x27;s preferences but are also more likely to withhold a house from all customers when it is in an integrated suburban neighborhood (redlining). Moreover, agents&#x27; marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas (steering); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white. These three findings are consistent with the possibility that agents act upon the belief that some types of transactions are relatively unlikely for black customers (statistical discrimination).&quot; Real estate appraisers discriminate against black homeowners. Historically, there was extensive and long-lasting racial discrimination against African-Americans in the housing and mortgage markets in the United States, as well as massive discrimination against black farmers, whose numbers massively declined in post-WWII America due to local and federal anti-black policies. Government actions in part facilitated racial discrimination in the housing market, leading to substantial and persistent racial residential segregation and contributing to the racial wealth gap.

According to a 2019 analysis by University of Pittsburgh economists, blacks faced a two-fold penalty due to the racially segregated housing market: rental prices increased in blocks when they underwent racial transition, whereas home values declined in neighborhoods that blacks moved into. A 2016 study found that industrial use zoning in Chicago tended to be allocated to neighborhoods that were populated by racial minorities.

A report by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development revealed that when the department sent African-Americans and whites to look at apartments, African-Americans were shown fewer apartments to rent and fewer houses for sale than whites were. A 2017 study found &quot;that applications [for Airbnb housing] from guests with distinctively African American names are 16 percent less likely to be accepted relative to identical guests with distinctively white names.&quot; A 2020 audit study of Boston found that prospective white renters were 32 percentage points more likely to be shown an apartment than similar prospective black renters.

A 2017 paper by Troesken and Walsh found that pre-20th century cities &quot;created and sustained residential segregation through private norms and vigilante activity.&quot; However, &quot;when these private arrangements began to break down during the early 1900s&quot;, whites started &quot;lobbying municipal governments for segregation ordinances&quot;. As a result, cities passed ordinances that &quot;prohibited members of the majority racial group on a given city block from selling or renting property to members of another racial group&quot; between 1909 and 1917.

Government policies have contributed significantly to the racial gap in homeownership because various government policies and benefits have made it easier for whites to become homeowners relative to blacks. A 2017 study by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economists found that the practice of redlining—the practice whereby banks discriminated against the inhabitants of certain neighborhoods—had a persistent adverse impact on the neighborhoods, with redlining affecting homeownership rates, home values, and credit scores in 2010. Since many African-Americans could not access conventional home loans, they had to turn to predatory lenders, who charged high interest rates. Due to lower home ownership rates, slumlords were able to rent out apartments that would otherwise be owned. A 2019 analysis estimated that predatory housing contracts targeting African-Americans in Chicago in the 1950s and 1960s cost black families between $3 billion and $4 billion in wealth.

A 2017 study in &quot;Research &amp; Politics&quot; found that white supporters of Donald Trump became less likely to approve of federal housing assistance when they were shown an image of a black man.

A 2018 study in the &quot;American Sociological Review&quot; found that housing market professionals (real estate agents, housing developers, mortgage appraisers, and home value appraisers) held derogatory racial views about black and Latino individuals and neighborhoods, whereas white individuals and neighborhoods were beneficiaries of widely shared, positive racial beliefs.

A 2018 experimental study by University of Illinois and Duke University economists found that real estate agents and housing providers systematically recommended homes in neighborhoods with higher poverty rates, greater pollution, higher crime rates, fewer college-educated families, and fewer skilled workers to minority individuals who had all the same characteristics as white individuals except ethnic differences.

A 2018 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; found that white voters in areas that experienced massive African-American population growth between 1940 and 1960 were more likely to vote for California Proposition 14 (1964), which sought to enshrine legal protections for landlords and property owners who discriminated against &quot;colored&quot; buyers and renters.

A 2018 study in the &quot;Journal of Politics&quot; found extensive evidence of discrimination against blacks and Hispanics in the New York City rental market. A 2018 study in the journal &quot;Regional Science and Urban Economics&quot; found that there was discrimination against blacks and Arab males in the U.S. rental market. A 2018 study in the &quot;Journal of Regional Science&quot; found that &quot;black households pay more for identical housing in identical neighborhoods than their white counterparts [...] In neighborhoods with the smallest fraction white, the premium is about 0.6%. In neighborhoods with the largest fraction white, it is about 2.4%.&quot;

A 2022 study found that ethnic minority hosts on Airbnb charge lower prices due to discrimination by consumers.

=== Labor market ===
Several meta-analyses find extensive evidence of ethnic and racial discrimination in hiring in the American labor market. A 2017 meta-analysis found &quot;no change in the levels of discrimination against African Americans since 1989, although we do find some indication of declining discrimination against Latinos.&quot; A 2016 meta-analysis of 738 correspondence tests – tests where identical CVs for stereotypically black and white names were sent to employers – in 43 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 1990 and 2015 finds that there is extensive racial discrimination in hiring decisions in Europe and North America. These correspondence tests showed that equivalently, minority candidates need to send around 50% more applications to be invited for an interview than majority candidates. A study that examined the job applications of actual people provided with identical résumés and similar interview training showed that African-American applicants with no criminal record were offered jobs at a rate as low as white applicants who had criminal records. A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found evidence of racial bias in how CVs were evaluated. A 2020 study found that there is not only discrimination towards minorities in callback rates in audit studies, but that the discrimination gets more severe after the callbacks in terms of job offers. A 2022 study involving 83,000 job applications sent to the 108 largest U.S. employers found that employers consistently favored applications with distinctively white names over black names. A 2021 study found discrimination among Swiss job recruiters against immigrant and minority groups.

Research suggests that light-skinned African American women have higher salaries and greater job satisfaction than dark-skinned women. Being &quot;too black&quot; has recently been acknowledged by the U.S. Federal courts in an employment discrimination case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In &quot;Etienne v. Spanish Lake Truck &amp; Casino Plaza, LLC&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit determined that an employee who was told on several occasions that her manager thought she was &quot;too black&quot; to do various tasks found that the issue of the employee&#x27;s skin color rather than race itself played a key role in an employer&#x27;s decision to keep the employee from advancing. A 2018 study found evidence suggesting discrimination against immigrants with darker skin colors.

A 2019 experimental study found that there was a bias against blacks, Latinos, and women in the hiring of postdocs in the fields of biology and physics. A 2020 study, which used a natural experiment with sun exposure and tans, found that darker-skinned individuals are discriminated against in the labor market.

A 2008 study found that black service providers receive lower tips than white service providers. Research shows that &quot;ban the box&quot; (the removal of the check box asking job applicants if they have criminal records) leads employers to discriminate against young, black, low-skilled applicants, possibly because employers simply assume these applicants have checkered pasts when they are not able to confirm it.

===Media===
Colorism in movies, print, and music can take several forms. It can be the representation of people of color in an ill light, the hiring of actors based on their skin color, the use of colors in costumes with the intention to differentiate between good and evil characters, or simply failing to represent people of color at all.

African Americans with lighter skin tone and &quot;European features&quot;, such as lighter eyes and smaller noses and lips, have more opportunities in the media industry. For example, film producers hire lighter-skinned African Americans more often, television producers choose lighter-skinned cast members, and magazine editors choose African American models that resemble European features. A content analysis conducted by Scott and Neptune (1997) shows that less than one percent of advertisements in major magazines featured African American models. When African Americans did appear in advertisements, they were mainly portrayed as athletes, entertainers, or unskilled laborers. In addition, seventy percent of the advertisements that featured animal print included African American women. Animal print reinforces the stereotypes that African Americans are animalistic in nature, sexually active, less educated, have lower income, and are extremely concerned with their personal appearances. Concerning African American males in the media, darker-skinned men are more likely to be portrayed as violent or more threatening, influencing the public perception of African American men. Since dark-skinned males are more likely to be linked to crime and misconduct, many people develop preconceived notions about the characteristics of black men.

Colorism was, and still is, very evident in the media. An example of this is the minstrel shows that were popular during and after slavery. Minstrel shows were a very popular form of theater that involved white and black people in blackface, portraying black people while doing demeaning things. The actors painted their faces with black paint and overlined their lips with bright red lipstick to exaggerate and make fun of black people. When minstrel shows died out and television became popular, black actors were rarely hired, and when they were, they had very specific roles. These roles included being servants, slaves, idiots, and criminals.

The absence of people of color in media, in settings where they normally should be present, is also called erasure.

=== Politics ===
A 2011 study found that white state legislators of both political parties were less likely to respond to constituents with African-American names. A 2013 study found that in response to e-mail correspondence from a putatively black alias, &quot;nonblack legislators were markedly less likely to respond when their political incentives to do so were diminished, black legislators typically continued to respond even when doing so promised little political reward. Black legislators thus appear substantially more intrinsically motivated to advance blacks&#x27; interests.&quot;

Some research suggests that white voters&#x27; voting behavior is motivated by racial threat. A 2016 study, for instance, found that white Chicago voters&#x27; turnout decreased when public housing was reconstructed and 25,000 African Americans were displaced. This suggests that white voters&#x27; turnout decreased due to not living in proximity to African-Americans.

Voter ID laws have brought on accusations of racial discrimination. In a 2014 review by the Government Accountability Office of the academic literature, three studies out of five found that voter ID laws reduced minority turnout, whereas two studies found no significant impact. Disparate impact may also be reflected in access to information about voter ID laws. A 2015 experimental study found that election officials queried about voter ID laws are more likely to respond to emails from a non-Latino white name (70.5% response rate) than a Latino name (64.8% response rate), though response accuracy was similar across groups. Studies have also analyzed racial differences in ID request rates. A 2012 study in the city of Boston found that black and Hispanic voters were more likely to be asked for ID during the 2008 election. According to exit polls, 23% of whites, 33% of blacks, and 38% of Hispanics were asked for ID, though this effect is partially attributed to blacks and Hispanics preferring non-peak voting hours when election officials inspected a greater portion of IDs. Precinct differences also confound the data, as black and Hispanic voters tended to vote in black and Hispanic-majority precincts. A 2010 study of the 2006 midterm election in New Mexico found that Hispanics were more likely to incur ID requests, while early voters, women, and non-Hispanics were less likely to incur requests. A 2009 study of the 2006 midterm election nationwide found that 47% of white voters reported being asked to show photo identification at the polls, compared with 54% of Hispanics and 55% of African Americans. Very few were, however, denied the vote as a result of voter identification requests. A 2015 study found that turnout among blacks in Georgia was generally higher since the state began enforcing its strict voter ID law. A 2016 study by University of California, San Diego researchers found that voter ID laws &quot;have a differentially negative impact on the turnout of Hispanics, Blacks, and mixed-race Americans in primaries and general elections.&quot;

Research by University of Oxford economist Evan Soltas and Stanford political scientist David Broockman suggests that voters act upon racially discriminatory tastes. A 2018 study in &quot;Public Opinion Quarterly&quot; found that whites, in particular those who had racial resentment, largely attributed Obama&#x27;s success among African-Americans to his race and not his characteristics as a candidate or the political preferences of African-Americans. A 2018 study in the journal &quot;American Politics Research&quot; found that white voters tended to misperceive political candidates from racial minorities as being more ideologically extreme than objective indicators would suggest; this adversely affected the electoral chances for those candidates. A 2018 study in the &quot;Journal of Politics&quot; found that &quot;when a white candidate makes vague statements, many [nonblack] voters project their own policy positions onto the candidate, increasing support for the candidate. But they are less likely to extend black candidates the same courtesy. [...] In fact, black male candidates who make ambiguous statements are actually punished for doing so by racially prejudiced voters.&quot;

A 2018 study found evidence of racial-motivated reasoning as voters assessed President Barack Obama&#x27;s economic performance. The study found that &quot;Whites attributed more responsibility to Obama under negative economic conditions (i.e., blame) than positive economic conditions (i.e., credit). [...] Whites attributed equal responsibility to the President and governors for negative economic conditions, but gave more responsibility to governors than Obama for positive conditions. Whites also gave governors more responsibility for state improvements than they gave Obama for national ones.&quot; It is also alleged that during his senatorial run in 2008 against former senator and later presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Clinton&#x27;s campaign team intentionally darkened Obama&#x27;s face while running campaign ads. Although her camp denied the accusations, the intention, whether apparent or not, stems from the system of colorism and viewing or equating darker skin tones as bad and in a negative light.

A 2018 study examining &quot;all 24 African American challengers (non-incumbents) from 2000 to 2014 to white challengers from the same party running in the same state for the same office around the same time&quot; found &quot;that white challengers are about three times more likely to win and receive about 13 percentage points more support among white voters. These estimates hold when controlling for a number of potential confounding factors and when employing several statistical matching estimators.&quot;

A 2019 study found that whites are less supportive of welfare when they are told that blacks are the majority of recipients (as opposed to whites). However, when informed that most welfare recipients eventually gain jobs and leave the welfare program, this racial bias disappears.

An analysis by MIT political scientist Regina Bateson found that Americans engage in strategic discrimination against racial minority candidates out of a belief that they are less electable than white male candidates. &quot;In the abstract, Americans consider white men more &quot;electable&quot; than equally qualified black and female candidates. Additionally, concerns about winning the votes of white men can cause voters to rate black and female Democratic candidates as less capable of beating Donald Trump in 2020.&quot;

A 2019 paper found, using smartphone data, that voters in predominantly black neighborhoods waited far longer at polling places than voters in white neighborhoods.

A 2021 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; found that black protestors were perceived to be more violent in protests than white protestors when they were protesting for the same goals.

===Beauty===
Susan L. Bryant has written that the European beauty standard is &quot;the notion that the more closely associated a person is with European features, the more attractive he or she is considered&quot;. 

However, an actual study that sought to test this hypothesis found no evidence of a &quot;Eurocentric beauty standard&quot; for women. Using Chinese immigrants and White American citizens, this study found that their ideals of female beauty were not significantly different. Participants in the study rated Asian and Latina women as more attractive than White and Black women, and it was found that Asian and Latina women had more of the attributes that were considered attractive for women. Exposure to Western media did not influence or improve the Asian men&#x27;s ratings of White women, which is inconsistent with the idea of a &quot;Eurocentric beauty ideal&quot;. Shirley Hune notes that the success of Asian and mixed-Asian women in beauty pageants casts doubt on the idea of a Eurocentric beauty ideal.

=== Sports ===
A 2018 study found evidence that non-black voters in Heisman Trophy voting were biased against non-black players. A 2021 study found that black NBA players were 30% more likely to exit the league in any given season than white players with similar player statistics. A 2019 study found that after controlling for objective measures of performance, broadcast commentators were &quot;more likely to discuss the performance and mental abilities of lighter-skinned players and the physical characteristics of darker-skinned players&quot; in the Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament.

A 2020 report found that football commentators were more likely to praise white players for their intelligence and leadership qualities while criticizing black players for lacking those attributes. Black players were four times more likely to be praised for their strength and seven times more likely to be praised for their speed.

A 2017 study found that racially resentful whites become less likely to favor salaries for college athletes when they are primed to think about African Americans.

<text>The Aruwimi River (, ) is a tributary of the Congo River, located to the north and east of the Congo.

The Aruwimi begins as the Ituri River, which rises near Lake Albert, in the savannas north of the Kibale River watershed. It then runs generally south southwest until it is joined by the Shari River which flows by Bunia. The Ituri then turns west, through the Ituri Forest, becoming the Aruwimi where the Nepoko (or Nepoki) River joins it, at the town of Bomili. The river continues westward, joining the Congo at Basoko. The length of the Aruwimi–Ituri-Nizi is about , with the Ituri being about , the Nizi about and the Aruwimi about . The Aruwimi is about wide where it joins the Congo.

The watershed of the Ituri/Aruwimi is almost entirely dense forest, with just a handful of villages along its course, and crossed by roads in about four places. The Kango language (SIL code KZY) is spoken by several thousand villagers just south of Avakubi, and upper reaches of the Ituri are inhabited by the Mbuti (Pygmies).

The Aruwimi was explored by Henry Morton Stanley during his 1887 expedition to &quot;rescue&quot; Emin Pasha. The cataracts above Yambuya made it impossible to use the river for navigation, and the expedition had to go by land, with tremendous difficulty.

Tributaries:
* Nepoko River
* Lenda River

Settlements:
* Bomaneh
* Mongandjo
* Yambuya
* Banalia
* Panga
* Bafwangbe
* Bomili
* Avakubi
* Teturi
* Bunia

<text>The Ituri River (French: &quot;Rivière Ituri&quot;) is a river of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is the main tributary of the Aruwimi River, which forms where the Ituri meets the Nepoko River.
It gives its name to Ituri Province.

==Course==

The Ituri has its headwaters in province of Haut-Uélé in the mountains to the west of Lake Albert, about north of Kaladau.
It flows generally south into Ituri province, and flows past Mongbwalu to the east.
It is joined from the left by Shari River to the northeast of Irumu about south-southwest of Bunia.
It is joined from the left by the Malibongo River near Komanda Helipad.
From there it flows in a generally westward direction to Bomili in Tshopo province, where it is joined by the Nepoko River to form the Aruwimi. 

The Ituri is long. The Aruwimi is long, giving a combined length of .

The river flows through the Ituri Rainforest.
About one-fifth of the rainforest is made up of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, a World Heritage Site.

==History==

In 1903 prospectors working for the Congo Free State discovered gold in the Ituri River.
This led to the opening of the Kilo mine in 1905 and the Moto mine in 1911, and in 1919 to creation of the &quot;Régie Industrielle des Mines de Kilo-Moto&quot;.

<text>The Lualaba River (, ) flows entirely within the eastern part of Democratic Republic of the Congo. It provides the greatest streamflow to the Congo River, while the source of the Congo is recognized as the Chambeshi. The Lualaba is long. Its headwaters are in the country&#x27;s far southeastern corner near Musofi and Lubumbashi in Katanga Province, next to the Zambian Copperbelt.

==Course==
The source of the Lualaba River is on the Katanga plateau, at an elevation of above sea level. The river flows northward to end near Kisangani, where the name Congo River officially begins. From the Katanga plateau it drops, with waterfalls and rapids marking the descent, to the Manika plateau. As it descends through the upper Upemba Depression (Kamalondo Trough), in . Near Nzilo Falls it is dammed for hydroelectric power at the Nzilo Dam.

At Bukama in Haut-Lomami District the river becomes navigable for about through a series of marshy lakes in the lower Upemba Depression, including Lake Upemba and Lake Kisale. Ankoro lies on the west bank of the Lualaba River, opposite its confluence with the Luvua River from the east. Some geographers call the combined river below this point the &quot;Upper Congo&quot;.

Below Kongolo, the river becomes unnavigable as it enters the narrow gorge of Portes d&#x27;Enfer (&quot;Gates of Hell&quot;). Between Kasongo and Kibombo, the river is navigable for about , before rapids make it unnavigable again between Kibombo and Kindu (&quot;Port-Empain&quot;). From Kindu up to the Boyoma Falls at Ubundu, the stream is navigable again for more than 300 kilometres. The Boyoma Falls or Stanley Falls are made up of seven cataracts, over a stretch of of the river, between Ubundu and Kisangani. The river&#x27;s end is marked after the seventh cataract, near Kisangani, where it becomes the Congo River.

The Lualaba River serves as the northern and western boundary of Upemba National Park, protecting habitats on the Kibara Plateau in Katanga Province of the southeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

=== Tributaries===

The largest tributaries of the Lualaba River are:
*Ulindi River
*Luama River
*Lukuga River — &quot;drains Lake Tanganyika&quot;.
*Lufira River
*Lubudi River
*Luvua River
*Elila River
*Lowa
*Kilungutwe River

===Cities and towns===
Cities and towns along and near the Lualaba River include:
*Ankoro —&quot;on west bank, opposite confluence with Luvua River&quot;.
*Bukama
*Kabalo
*Kasongo 
*Kongolo
*Kisangani — &quot;near the seventh cataract of Boyoma Falls&quot;.
*Ubundu — &quot;just above first cataract of Boyoma Falls&quot;.

==History==
The Lualaba River was once considered a possible source of the Nile, until Henry Morton Stanley journeyed down it and proved that it drained into the Atlantic Ocean. Stanley referred to it as the Livingstone. &quot;Had not Livingstone spoken of the river at Nyangwe as the Lualaba, I should not have mentioned the word except as a corruption by the Waguha of the Wenya term Lu-al-ow-wa...&quot;

French colonial governor Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza also explored the Lualaba.

<doc id="354236" wikidata="Q15303501" url="?curid=354236" title="Secularity">
<text>Secularity, also the secular or secularness (from Latin , or ), is the state of being unrelated or neutral in regards to religion. The origins of secularity can be traced to the Bible itself. The concept was fleshed out through Christian history into the modern era. In the Middle Ages, there were even secular clergy. Furthermore, secular and religious entities were not separated in the medieval period, but coexisted and interacted naturally. The word &quot;secular&quot; has a meaning very similar to profane as used in a religious context.

Today, anything that is not directly connected with religion may be considered secular, in other words, neutral to religion. Secularity does not mean , but . Many activities in religious bodies are secular, and though there are multiple types of secularity or secularization, most do not lead to irreligiosity. Linguistically, a process by which anything becomes secular is named &quot;secularization&quot;, though the term is mainly reserved for the secularization of society; and any concept or ideology promoting the secular may be termed &quot;secularism&quot;, a term generally applied to the ideology dictating no religious influence on the public sphere. Scholars recognize that secularity is structured by Protestant models of Christianity, shares a parallel language to religion, and intensifies Protestant features such as iconoclasm, skepticism towards rituals, and emphasizes beliefs. In doing so, secularism perpetuates Christian traits under a different name. 

Most cultures around the world do not have tension or dichotomous views of religion and secularity. Since &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;secular&quot; are both Western concepts that were formed under the influence of Christian theology, other cultures do not necessarily have words or concepts that resemble or are equivalent to them.

==Definitions==

Historically, the word &quot;secular&quot; was not related or linked to religion, but was a freestanding term in Latin that would relate to any mundane endeavour. However, the term, ( being the genitive plural of ) as found in the New Testament in the Vulgate translation () of the original Koine Greek phrase (), e.g. at Galatians 1:5, was used in the early Christian church (and is still used today), in the doxologies, to denote the coming and going of the ages, the grant of eternal life, and the long duration of created things from their beginning to &quot;forever and ever&quot;. &quot;Secular&quot; and &quot;secularity&quot; derive from the Latin word &quot;&quot; which meant or denoted a period of about one hundred years. The Christian doctrine that God exists outside time led medieval Western culture to use &quot;secular&quot; to indicate separation from specifically religious affairs and involvement in temporal ones.

==Modern and historical understandings of the term==

&quot;Secular&quot; does not necessarily imply hostility or rejection of God or religion, though some use the term this way (see &quot;secularism&quot;, below); Martin Luther used to speak of &quot;secular work&quot; as a vocation from God for most Christians. &quot;Secular&quot; has been a part of the Christian church&#x27;s history, which even developed in the medieval period &quot;secular clergy&quot;, priests who were defined as the Church&#x27;s geographically-delimited diocesan clergy and not a part of the diasporal monastic orders. This arrangement continues today. The Waldensians advocated for secularity by separation of church and state. According to cultural anthropologists such as Jack David Eller, secularity is best understood not as being &quot;anti-religious&quot;, but as being &quot;religiously neutral&quot; since many activities in religious bodies are secular themselves, and most versions of secularity do not lead to irreligiosity. 

The idea of a dichotomy between religion and the secular originated in the European Enlightenment. Furthermore, since &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;secular&quot; are both Western concepts that were formed under the influence of Christian theology, other cultures do not necessarily have words or concepts that resemble or are equivalent to them.

One can regard eating and bathing as examples of secular activities, because there may not be anything inherently religious about them. Nevertheless, some religious traditions see both eating and bathing as sacraments, therefore making them religious activities within those world views. Saying a prayer derived from religious text or doctrine, worshipping through the context of a religion, performing corporal and spiritual works of mercy, and attending a religious seminary school or monastery are examples of religious (non-secular) activities.

In many cultures, there is little dichotomy between &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;supernatural&quot;, &quot;religious&quot; and &quot;not-religious&quot;, especially since people have beliefs in other supernatural or spiritual things irrespective of belief in God or gods. Other cultures stress practice of ritual rather than belief. Conceptions of both &quot;secular&quot; and &quot;religious&quot;, while sometimes having some parallels in local cultures, were generally imported along with Western worldviews, often in the context of colonialism. Attempts to define either the &quot;secular&quot; or the &quot;religious&quot; in non-Western societies, accompanying local modernization and Westernization processes, were often and still are fraught with tension. Due to all these factors, &quot;secular&quot; as a general term of reference was much deprecated in social sciences, and is used carefully and with qualifications.

===Taylorian secularity===

Philosopher Charles Taylor in his 2007 book &quot;A Secular Age&quot; understands and discusses the secularity of Western societies less in terms of how much of a role religion plays in public life (&quot;secularity 1&quot;), or how religious a society&#x27;s individual members are (&quot;secularity 2&quot;), than as a &quot;backdrop&quot; or social context in which religious belief is no longer taken as a given (&quot;secularity 3&quot;). For Taylor, this third sense of secularity is the unique historical condition in which virtually all individuals – religious or not – have to contend with the fact that their values, morality, or sense of life&#x27;s meaning are no longer underpinned by communally-accepted religious facts. All religious beliefs or irreligious philosophical positions are, in a secular society, held with an awareness that there are a wide range of other contradictory positions available to any individual; belief in general becomes a different type of experience when all particular beliefs are optional. A plethora of competing religious and irreligious worldviews open up, each rendering the other more &quot;fragile&quot;. This condition in turn entails for Taylor that even clearly religious beliefs and practices are experienced in a qualitatively different way when they occur in a secular social context. In Taylor&#x27;s sense of the term, a society could in theory be highly &quot;secular&quot; even if nearly all of its members believed in a deity or even subscribed to a particular religious creed; secularity here has to do with the conditions, not the prevalence, of belief, and these conditions are understood to be shared across a given society, irrespective of belief or lack thereof.

Taylor&#x27;s thorough account of secularity as a socio-historical condition, rather than the absence or diminished importance of religion, has been highly influential in subsequent philosophy of religion and sociology of religion, particularly as older sociological narratives about secularisation, desecularisation, and disenchantment have come under increased criticism.

<doc id="354237" wikidata="Q360680" url="?curid=354237" title="H. H. Holmes">
<text>Herman Webster Mudgett (May 16, 1861 – May 7, 1896), better known as Dr. Henry Howard Holmes or H. H. Holmes, was an American con artist and serial killer active between 1891 and 1894. By the time of his execution in 1896, Holmes had engaged in a lengthy criminal career that included insurance fraud, forgery, swindling, three or four bigamous marriages, horse theft, and murder. Known as the Beast of Chicago, the Devil in the White City, or the Torture Doctor, his most notorious crimes took place in Chicago around the time of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893.

Holmes was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Benjamin Pitezel, his accomplice in several of his cons. However, Holmes confessed to 27 murders, including those of some people who were verifiably still alive. It is believed that he also killed three of Pitezel&#x27;s children, as well as three mistresses, the child of one mistress and the sister of another. Holmes was hanged on May 7, 1896.

Much of the lore attached to Holmes concerns the so-called &quot;Murder Castle&quot;, a three-story building he commissioned on W. 63rd Street in Chicago, Illinois. Details about the building, along with many of his alleged crimes, are considered exaggerated or fabricated for sensationalistic tabloid pieces with some accounts estimating his body count could be as high as 133 or even 200. Many of these inaccuracies have persisted due to the combination of ineffective police investigation and hyperbolic yellow journalism of the period, which are often cited as historical record.

Holmes gave various contradictory accounts of his life, initially claiming innocence, and later that he was possessed by Satan. His propensity for lying has made it difficult for researchers to ascertain the truth on the basis of his statements. For example, he claimed that Dr. Robert Leacock, a fellow medical school classmate, was one of his first murder victims, and that he killed him in 1886 for insurance money; however, Leacock died on October 5, 1889, in Watford, Ontario, Canada.

Since the 1990s, Holmes has often been described as a serial killer. In his book about Holmes, author Adam Selzer writes: &quot;Just killing several people isn&#x27;t necessarily enough for most definitions [of a serial killer]. More often, it has to be a series of similar crimes, committed over a period of time, usually more to satisfy a psychological urge on the killer&#x27;s part than any more practical motive.&quot; He adds: &quot;The murders we can connect &#x27;Holmes&#x27; to generally had a clear motive: someone knew too much, or was getting in his way, and couldn&#x27;t be trusted. The murders weren&#x27;t simply for love of bloodshed but a necessary part of furthering his swindling option and protecting his lifestyle.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Holmes was born as Herman Webster Mudgett on May 16, 1861, in Gilmanton, New Hampshire, the third child of Levi Horton Mudgett and Theodate Page Price, both of whom were descended from the first English settlers in the area. He had two older siblings, Ellen and Arthur, and one younger brother, Henry. As an adolescent, Holmes attended Phillips Exeter Academy before graduating high school with honors from Gilmanton Academy when he was 16.

Holmes&#x27;s parents were both devout Methodists. His father was from a farming family, and at times worked as a farmer, trader and house painter. He was also reportedly a heavy drinker who cruelly beat his children. Holmes also faced bullying by classmates due to his outstanding academic capabilities. In one incident, he was forced to stand in front of a human skeleton and put the skeleton&#x27;s hands on his face in an effort to frighten him. Initially terrified, Holmes later discovered the experience to be intriguing and claimed that it helped him overcome his worries. Holmes subsequently developed an obsession with death as a result of the encounter, and began dissecting animals.

In 1879, Holmes enrolled at the University of Vermont for one year. In 1882, he transferred to the University of Michigan&#x27;s Department of Medicine and Surgery. Despite his mediocre academic performance, Holmes graduated in June 1884. While enrolled, he worked in the anatomy lab under Professor William James Herdman, then the chief anatomy instructor, and the two were said to have been engaged in facilitating graverobbing to supply medical cadavers. Holmes had apprenticed in New Hampshire under Nahum Wight, a noted advocate of human dissection. Years later, when Holmes was suspected of murder and claimed to be nothing but an insurance fraudster, he admitted to using cadavers to defraud life insurance companies several times in college.

==Murders==
Holmes moved to Chicago in August 1886, which is when he began using the pseudonym &quot;H. H. Holmes&quot;. Soon after his arrival, he came across a drugstore at the northwest corner of South Wallace Avenue and West 63rd Street in the Englewood section of Chicago. The drugstore&#x27;s owner, Elizabeth Holton, gave Holmes a job; he proved to be a hardworking employee, eventually buying the store.

Contrary to several accounts, Holmes did not kill Dr. E. S. Holton. Holmes purchased an empty lot across the street, where construction began in 1887 for a two-story mixed-use building, with apartments on the second floor and retail spaces, including a new drugstore, on the first. When Holmes declined to pay the architects or the steel company, Aetna Iron and Steel, they took him to court in 1888. In 1892, he added a third floor, telling investors and suppliers he intended to use it as a hotel during the upcoming World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition.

Contemporary accounts report that Holmes built the hotel to lure tourists visiting the Exposition in order to kill them and sell their skeletons to nearby medical schools. Although he did have a history of selling stolen cadavers to medical schools, Holmes had acquired these wares through graverobbing rather than murder. Likewise, there is no evidence that Holmes ever murdered Exposition-goers on the premises. The yellow press labeled the building as Holmes&#x27;s &quot;Murder Castle&quot;, claiming the structure contained secret torture chambers, trapdoors, gas chambers and a basement crematorium; none of these sensationalised claims were true.

Other accounts stated that the hotel was made up of over a hundred rooms and laid out like a maze, with doors opening into brick walls, windowless rooms and dead-end staircases. In reality, the third-floor hotel was moderately sized, largely unremarkable and uncompleted due to Holmes&#x27;s disputes with the builders. It did contain some hidden rooms, but they were used for hiding furniture Holmes bought on credit and did not intend to pay for. Holmes did not kill an alleged &quot;Castle&quot; victim, Miss Kate Durkee, who turned out to be very much alive. In his confession, Holmes stated that his usual method of killing was to suffocate his victims using various means, including an overdose of chloroform, overexposure to lighting gas fumes, and trapping them in an airless vault. Holmes also claimed to have used starvation, and to have burnt victims alive in his &quot;castle&quot;.

Holmes&#x27;s hotel was gutted by a fire started by an unknown arsonist shortly after his arrest, but was largely rebuilt and used as a post office until 1938. Besides his infamous &quot;Murder Castle&quot;, Holmes also owned a one-story factory which he claimed was to be used for glass bending. It is unclear if the factory furnace was ever used for this purpose; it was speculated to have been used to destroy incriminating evidence of Holmes&#x27;s crimes.

===Presumed murders===
* Holmes&#x27;s mistress, 31-year-old Julia Smythe, was the wife of Dr. Laurence Conner, who had moved into his building and began working at his pharmacy&#x27;s jewelry counter. After Conner found out about Smythe&#x27;s affair with Holmes, he quit his job and moved away, leaving Smythe and their 5-year-old daughter Pearl Conner behind. Smythe gained custody of Pearl and remained at the hotel, continuing her relationship with Holmes. Julia and Pearl both disappeared on Christmas Eve of 1891. Holmes initially claimed that Julia had left unexpectedly to visit her dying sister, but then changed his story and said that she had fled her former husband. Ultimately, Holmes later claimed that Julia had actually died during an abortion. Despite his medical background, Holmes was unlikely to be experienced in carrying out abortions, and mortality from such a procedure was high at that time. Holmes then claimed to have poisoned Pearl, likely to hide the circumstances of her mother&#x27;s death. A partial skeleton, possibly of a child around Pearl&#x27;s age, was found when excavating Holmes&#x27;s cellar. Pearl&#x27;s father was a key witness at Holmes&#x27;s trial in Chicago.
* 23-year-old Emeline Cigrand began working in Holmes&#x27;s building in May 1892 and worked for him for six months. Holmes reportedly hired Cigrand as a secretary due to her connection to a doctor who peddled a &quot;vaccine&quot; that allegedly cured alcoholism. Those who saw Cigrand in the weeks before her disappearance noted that she appeared to have lost interest in Holmes and their relationship. Cigrand was last seen in December 1892. Her parents were informed that she had left to marry a man named &quot;Robert Phelps&quot;. Authorities hypothesised that she had gotten pregnant by Holmes, possibly being a victim of another failed abortion that Holmes tried to cover up. Her empty luggage trunk was sent back to her mother in Anderson, Indiana; her skeleton was found by police at the home of a Chicago physician with the help of M. G. Chappel, who admitted having articulated three skeletons for H. H. Holmes.
* In early 1893, a 24-year-old one-time actress named Wilhelmina &quot;Minnie&quot; Williams moved to Chicago. Holmes claimed to have met her in an employment office, though it is believed that he had actually met her in Boston several years earlier while he was then going by the alias &quot;Harry Gordon&quot;. Holmes offered her a job at the hotel as his personal stenographer, and she accepted. Holmes persuaded Williams to transfer the deed to her property in Fort Worth, Texas, to a man named &quot;Alexander Bond&quot; which was an alias of Holmes. In April 1893, Williams transferred the deed, with Holmes serving as the notary. Holmes later signed the deed over to Pitezel, giving him the alias &quot;Benton T. Lyman&quot;. In the following month, Holmes and Williams, presenting themselves as husband and wife, rented an apartment in Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Park. Minnie&#x27;s younger sister, 18-year-old Anna &quot;Nannie&quot; Williams, came to visit, and on July 5, 1893, she wrote to her aunt that she planned to accompany &quot;Brother Harry&quot; to Europe. In it, she signed off with the message: &quot;Brother Harry [Holmes] says you need never trouble any more about me, financially or otherwise. He and sister will see to me. I hope our hard days are over.&quot; Afterward neither Minnie nor Nannie were ever seen alive, and Holmes would subsequently use Minnie&#x27;s name in future scams.

===Suspected murders===
* A 68-year-old creditor of Holmes named John DeBrueil died of apoplexy on April 17, 1891, in the &quot;Castle&quot; drugstore. DuBreuil collapsed and died shortly after Holmes poured a &quot;black liquid&quot; down his throat, according to a witness. was not suspected; in 1895, it was determined that DuBrueil&#x27;s life had been insured, and that Holmes had profited from his death.
* In 1891, Emily Van Tassel disappeared after working at Holmes’ drugstore; Holmes spoke of her in his confession. In 1897, Tassel&#x27;s name was cited in a list of suspected victims and Tassel&#x27;s mother believed she was a possible victim.
* &quot;Dr. Russler&quot; had an office in the &quot;Castle&quot; and went missing in 1892; Holmes mentioned killing Russler in his confession.
* Kitty Kelly, a stenographer for Holmes, also went missing in 1892. 
* John Davis of Greenville, Pennsylvania, went to visit the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair and vanished. In 1920, he was declared legally dead. 
* Harry Walker of Greensburg, Indiana, went missing in November 1893. He was alleged to have insured his life to Holmes for $20,000 and wrote to friends that he was working for Holmes in Chicago. 
* Holmes and Pitezel took George Thomas out to a Mississippi swamp on the Tombigbee River in June 1894, killed him, and disposed of the body. Holmes confessed to the murder to his second wife.
* Milford Cole of Baltimore, disappeared after receiving a telegram from Holmes to come to Chicago in July 1894. 
* An additional possible victim was Lucy Burbank; her bankbook was found with human hair in a chimney flue at the &quot;Castle&quot; in 1895.
* Holmes is alleged to have killed two persons in Lake County, Illinois, in the 1890s. Their deaths were confirmed years later when the remains of an unknown man and woman were found on a farm in 1919, twenty-three years after his execution.

===Pitezel killings===


While working in the Chemical Bank building on Dearborn Street, Holmes met and became close friends with 38-year-old Benjamin Freelon Pitezel, a carpenter with a criminal past who was exhibiting, in the same building, a coal bin he had invented. Holmes used Pitezel as his right-hand man for several criminal schemes. A district attorney later described Pitezel as &quot;Holmes&#x27;s tool... his creature&quot;. With insurance companies pressing to prosecute him for arson, Holmes left Chicago in July 1894. He reappeared in Fort Worth, where he had inherited property from the Williams sisters, at the intersection of modern-day Commerce Street and 2nd Street. Here, he once again attempted to build an incomplete structure without paying his suppliers and contractors.

In July 1894, Holmes was arrested and briefly jailed for the first time, on the charge of selling mortgaged goods in St. Louis, Missouri. He was promptly bailed out, but while in jail he struck up a conversation with a convicted outlaw named Marion Hedgepeth, who was serving a 25-year sentence. Holmes had concocted a plan to swindle an insurance company out of $10,000 by taking out a policy on himself and then faking his death. Holmes promised Hedgepeth a $500 commission in exchange for the name of a lawyer who could be trusted. Holmes was directed to a young St. Louis attorney named Jeptha Howe. Howe thought Holmes&#x27;s scheme was brilliant, and agreed to play a part. Nevertheless, Holmes&#x27;s plan to fake his own death failed when the insurance company became suspicious and refused to pay. Holmes did not press the claim; instead, he concocted a similar plan with Pitezel.

Pitezel agreed to fake his own death so that his wife could collect on a $10,000 life insurance policy, which he was to split with Holmes and Howe. The scheme, which was to take place in Philadelphia, called for Pitezel to set himself up as an inventor under the name &quot;B.F. Perry&quot;, and then be killed and disfigured in a lab explosion. Holmes was to find an appropriate cadaver to play the role of Pitezel. Instead, Holmes killed Pitezel on September 4, 1894, by knocking him unconscious with chloroform and setting his body on fire with the use of benzene. In his confession, Holmes implied Pitezel was still alive after he used the chloroform on him, before he set him on fire. However, forensic evidence presented at Holmes&#x27;s later trial showed chloroform had been administered after Pitezel&#x27;s death, a fact of which the insurance company was unaware, presumably to stage a suicide to exonerate Holmes should he be charged with murder.

Holmes collected the insurance payout on the basis of the genuine Pitezel corpse. Holmes then went on to manipulate Pitezel&#x27;s unsuspecting wife, Carrie Alice Canning, into allowing three of her five children to be placed in his custody. The three children who were placed under Holmes&#x27;s care were 13-year-old Alice Pitezel, nine-year-old Nellie Pitezel, and seven-year-old Howard Robert Pitezel. Holmes and the three Pitezel children traveled throughout the Northeastern United States and into Canada. He simultaneously escorted Carrie along a parallel route, all the while using various aliases and lying to Carrie concerning her husband&#x27;s death by claiming Pitezel was hiding in London, as well as lying to her about the true whereabouts of her three missing children. In Detroit, just before entering Canada, they were only separated by a few blocks.

In an even more audacious move, Holmes was staying at another location with his current wife, who was unaware of the whole affair. Holmes later confessed to murdering Alice and Nellie on October 25, 1894, by forcing them into a large trunk and locking them inside. He drilled a hole in the lid of the trunk and put one end of a hose through the hole, attaching the other end to a gas line to asphyxiate the girls. Holmes buried their nude bodies in the cellar of his rental house at 16 St. Vincent Street in Toronto.

Frank Geyer was a Philadelphia Police Department detective assigned to investigate Holmes and find the three missing children. Geyer began in June 1894 to trace Holmes&#x27;s steps, and found the decomposed bodies of the two Pitezel girls in the cellar of the Toronto home. The detective wrote: &quot;The deeper we dug, the more horrible the odor became, and when we reached the depth of three feet, we discovered what appeared to be the bone of the forearm of a human being.&quot; In Toronto, Geyer discovered unsent letters written by the Pitezel children that Holmes had kept. This information led to further investigations of Holmes&#x27;s Chicago property, and ultimately led Geyer to Indianapolis, where Holmes had rented a home in the Irvington neighborhood. Holmes was reported to have visited a local pharmacy to purchase the drugs which he had used to kill Howard Pitezel on October 10, 1894, and a repair shop to sharpen the knives he used to chop up the body before he burned it. The boy&#x27;s teeth and bone were discovered in the home&#x27;s chimney.

== Capture and execution ==
Holmes&#x27;s murder spree finally ended when he was arrested in Boston on November 17, 1894, after being tracked there from Philadelphia by the private Pinkerton National Detective Agency. He was held on an outstanding warrant for horse theft in Texas because the authorities had become more suspicious at this point and Holmes appeared poised to flee the country in the company of his unsuspecting third wife.

In July 1895, following the discovery of Alice and Nellie&#x27;s bodies, Chicago police and reporters began investigating Holmes&#x27;s building in Englewood, now locally referred to as the &quot;Castle&quot;. Though many sensational claims were made, no evidence was found which could have convicted Holmes in Chicago. as there was only very circumstantial physical evidence of the &quot;Castle&quot; victims: a piece of human bone possibly from Julia Conner; remains of a child, possibly Pearl Conner; a burned gold watch chain and burned dress buttons-apparently belonging to Minnie Williams; and a tuft of human female hair found in a chimney flue. Thus Holmes would be tried for the murder of Pitezel in Philadelphia which had the clearest case for murder.

In October 1895, Holmes was put on trial for the murder of Benjamin Pitezel, and was found guilty and sentenced to death. By then, it was evident Holmes had also murdered the three missing Pitezel children. Following his conviction, Holmes confessed to twenty-seven murders in Chicago, Indianapolis, and Toronto, and six attempted murders. Holmes was paid $7,500 by the Hearst newspapers in exchange for his confession. While writing his confessions in prison, Holmes mentioned how drastically his facial appearance had changed since his imprisonment.

On May 7, 1896, Holmes was hanged at Moyamensing Prison for the murder of Pitezel. Until the moment of his death, Holmes remained calm and amiable, showing very few signs of fear, anxiety, or depression. Despite this, he asked for his coffin to be contained in concrete and buried ten feet deep, because he was concerned grave robbers would steal his body and use it for dissection. Holmes&#x27;s neck did not break; he instead strangled to death slowly, twitching for over fifteen minutes before being pronounced dead.

Upon his execution, Holmes&#x27;s body was interred in an unmarked grave at Holy Cross Cemetery, a Catholic cemetery in the Philadelphia Western suburb of Yeadon, Pennsylvania. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1909, Hedgepeth, who had been pardoned for informing on Holmes, was shot and killed by Police Officer Edward Jaburek during a hold-up at a Chicago bar. On March 7, 1914, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that, with the death of Patrick Quinlan, the former caretaker of the &quot;Castle&quot;, &quot;the mysteries of Holmes&#x27;s castle&quot; would remain unexplained. Quinlan had committed suicide by taking strychnine. His body was found in his bedroom with a note that read: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t sleep.&quot; Quinlan&#x27;s surviving relatives claimed he had been &quot;haunted&quot; for several months and was suffering from hallucinations.

The Castle itself was damaged by a fire in August 1895. Two men were seen entering the back of the building at 9 p.m. About half an hour later, they were seen exiting the building and rapidly running away. Following several explosions, the castle went up in flames. Afterwards, investigators found a half-empty gas can underneath the back steps of the building. The building survived the fire and remained in use until it was torn down in 1938. The site is currently occupied by the Englewood branch of the United States Postal Service.

In 2017, during allegations Holmes had escaped execution, Holmes&#x27;s body was exhumed for testing led by Janet Monge of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Due to his coffin being contained in concrete, his body was found to not have decomposed normally. His clothes were almost perfectly preserved and his moustache was found to be intact. The body was positively identified by his teeth as being that of Holmes. He was then reburied.

==Personal life==

On July 4, 1878, Holmes married Clara Lovering in Alton, New Hampshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mudgett / Lovering marriage record 1878&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They had one son, Robert Lovering Mudgett (February 3, 1880 – November 3, 1956), who was born in Loudon. Robert went on to become a certified public accountant and served as city manager of Orlando, Florida. Holmes eventually enrolled in the University of Vermont in Burlington at age 18 but was dissatisfied with the school and left after one year.

Housemates later recalled that Holmes was physically violent with Clara, and in 1884, before his graduation, she moved back to New Hampshire and had little contact with him after that. After he moved to Mooers, New York, a rumor spread that Holmes had been seen with a little boy who later disappeared. Holmes claimed the boy went back to his home in Massachusetts. No investigation took place and Holmes quickly left town. He later traveled to Philadelphia and was hired as a keeper at Norristown State Hospital but quit after a few days. He then took a position at a drugstore in Philadelphia, but while he was working there a boy died after taking medicine that was purchased at the store. Holmes denied any involvement in the child&#x27;s death and immediately left the city. Before moving to Chicago, he changed his name to &quot;Henry Howard Holmes&quot; to avoid the possibility of being exposed by victims of his previous scams.

In late 1886, while still legally married to Clara, Holmes married 24-year-old Myrta Belknap in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He filed for divorce from Clara a few weeks after marrying Myrta, alleging infidelity on her part. The claims could not be proven and the suit went nowhere. Surviving paperwork indicated that Clara probably was never even informed of the suit. In any case, the divorce was never finalized; it was dismissed on June 4, 1891, on the grounds of &quot;want of prosecution.&quot;

Holmes had one daughter with Myrta, Lucy Theodate Holmes (July 4, 1889 – December 29, 1956), who was born in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago. Lucy later became a public schoolteacher. Holmes lived with Myrta and Lucy in Wilmette, Illinois, and spent most of his time in Chicago tending to business. He married Georgiana Yoke on January 17, 1894, in Denver, Colorado, while still married to both Clara and Myrta.

== In popular culture ==
The 1974 novel &quot;American Gothic&quot; by horror writer Robert Bloch is a fictionalized version of the story of Holmes. In 2015, a film adaptation of &quot;The Devil in the White City&quot;, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Martin Scorsese, was to begin filming. In 2019, Scorsese and DiCaprio were to be executive producers in a television version to have been released by Paramount TV and Hulu, but Hulu has since dropped them, leaving the show&#x27;s future undecided. Holmes was portrayed by Stephen Aberle in the second season of Supernatural, Episode &quot;No Exit&quot;. and by Joel Johnstone in the first season of Timeless, Episode &quot;The World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition&quot;. Holmes&#x27;s hotel, The Murder Castle, makes an appearance in the game, The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me, with various references to Holmes himself.

<doc id="354243" wikidata="Q2290552" url="?curid=354243" title="Hendrikje van Andel-Schipper">
<text>Hendrikje van Andel-Schipper (; born Hendrikje Schipper; 29 June 1890 – 30 August 2005) was a Dutch supercentenarian who lived to the age of 115 years, 62 days. She is the oldest person ever from the Netherlands, breaking the previous record of Catharina van Dam on , and from was the oldest verified person in the world. She became the oldest living person in the Netherlands on , at the age of 110 years and 232 days.

== Life ==
Van Andel-Schipper was born as Hendrikje Schipper in Smilde, a small village in Drenthe. She was born prematurely and there were doubts that she would survive. However, thanks to the continuous care of her grandmother during her first four weeks, she recovered. At the age of five on her first day of school, she was sick again and was removed from the school on advice of a local doctor. Her father, headmaster at the local school, taught her to read and write.

She had a love of theatre from a young age, but after her mother objected she decided not to pursue a career in acting and became a needlework teacher instead. At the age of 46, she met her future husband Dick van Andel, who worked in Amsterdam. She left her parents&#x27; home at the age of 47 and married Van Andel, a divorced tax inspector, in 1939, taking the hyphenated name of Van Andel-Schipper—which is customary in the Netherlands.

During the Second World War, she and her husband moved to Hoogeveen, where she had to sell jewellery to help pay for food during the German occupation. Her husband died from cancer in 1959. She underwent a mastectomy in 1990 after being diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 100. She continued to live on her own before moving into a retirement home at the age of 105.

She became the oldest recognized woman in Europe on the death of Maria Teresa Fumarola Ligorio in May 2003, and the oldest recognized person in Europe on the death of Joan Riudavets in March 2004. Following the death of Charlotte Benkner in early May 2004 Van Andel-Schipper became the second-oldest recognized person in the world behind Ramona Trinidad Iglesias-Jordan, whose death later that month left her apparently the world&#x27;s oldest at 113 years and 335 days old. However, María Capovilla from Ecuador was older, but her claim had not yet been verified.

For her 115th birthday in 2005, she received a visit from a daughter-in-law of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and a delegation from the Ajax football club. The last time the Ajax team visited her she complained that the other residents of her nursing home were &quot;hicks who don&#x27;t understand football&quot;. She had been a fan of the football club Ajax Amsterdam since she attended a match more than 80 years earlier. During her last years she was the last Dutch citizen to be born during the reign of King Willem III who died in 1890.

== Death ==
She died in her sleep on 30 August 2005, two months after her 115th birthday. She had remained mentally alert up until her death, but suffered from increasing frailty. Several days prior to her death she told the director of her nursing home, Johan Beijering, that &quot;It&#x27;s been nice, but the man upstairs says it&#x27;s time to go&quot;. She agreed to leave her body to science when she was 82. An autopsy at the University of Groningen revealed that she died of undetected gastric cancer, the tumor in her stomach being the size of a small fist. At the time of her death, she was the second-oldest living person behind María Capovilla.

== Longevity ==
Van Andel-Schipper had stated that the secret to her longevity was a serving of herring every day and drinking orange juice. She later jokingly added &quot;breathing.&quot; On another occasion, she gave the following advice: &quot;Don&#x27;t smoke and don&#x27;t drink too much alcohol. Just a small advocaat with cream on Sundays and holidays. And you must remain active.&quot;

On 9 December 2005, Guinness World Records recognized the claim of then 116-year-old María Capovilla of Ecuador to be the world&#x27;s oldest person, supplanting Van Andel-Schipper from the revised title, to become the world&#x27;s oldest living person on , upon the death of Ramona Trinidad Iglesias-Jordan, she would have become the world&#x27;s oldest living person at the age of .

In June 2008, Gert Holstege, a professor at the University of Groningen, said following a post-mortem analysis of Van Andel-Schipper&#x27;s brain that there was little indication of the kinds of problems in the brain, some related to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, that are normally found in individuals who survive to extreme ages. According to Holstege, hers was the first known brain of such an advanced age &quot;that did not have these problems.&quot;

The complete genome of Van Andel-Schipper has been analysed by the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, who are researching longevity genes. Her autopsy showed no traces of dementia, which some scientists had considered an inevitable part of aging.

A study published in &quot;Genome Research&quot; suggests the key to Van Andel-Schipper&#x27;s longevity may lie in her stem cells, which fight off infection. Her system was superior for repairing or getting rid of cells with dangerous mutations. The author of the study suggested personality may also have something to do with longevity as well: people who live past 100 tend to have forgiveness as a common character trait. They tend to focus on something positive when something bad happens. Whenever a misfortune befell her, Van Andel-Schipper&#x27;s response was to say that &quot;There&#x27;s no point in moaning.&quot; Another study has connected longer life spans, as exemplified by Van Andel-Schipper, to positive attitudes towards the aging process itself.

<doc id="354245" wikidata="Q3135497" url="?curid=354245" title="Hikari (train)">
<text>is the name of a high-speed train service running on the Tōkaidō and San&#x27;yō Shinkansen &quot;bullet train&quot; lines in Japan. Slower than the premier &quot;Nozomi&quot; but faster than the all-stations &quot;Kodama&quot;, the &quot;Hikari&quot; is the fastest train service on the Tōkaidō and San&#x27;yō Shinkansen that can be used with the Japan Rail Pass, which is not valid for travel on the &quot;Nozomi&quot; or &quot;Mizuho&quot; trains except through a special supplementary ticket.

==Service variations==

===&quot;West Hikari&quot;===

These JR West services first appeared in 1988 on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen between Shin-Ōsaka and Hakata using 6-car 0 series trains. 0 series 12-car SK units were employed on these services from 1989. From 11 March 2000, they were mostly replaced by the new 700 series &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; services, and were finally withdrawn on 21 April 2000. The &quot;West Hikari&quot; livery had a similar colour pattern to the newer 100 series rolling stock, most of which were allocated to JR Central when the Japanese National Railways (JNR) was privatised in 1987. The interior was refurbished, with the conventional 2+3 seat configuration changed to a 2+2 configuration, and the buffet car converted into a café car.

===&quot;Grand Hikari&quot;===

These were the premier services operated between Tokyo and Hakata from 11 March 1989 using JR West 16-car 100 series V sets with four double-deck centre cars including a restaurant car. JR West inherited no 100 series train sets when JNR was privatised. On the other hand, unlike the Tōkaidō Shinkansen, the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen had a severe competition with aeroplanes, and there was an imminent need to introduce a faster and more comfortable flagship train.

The 100 series V sets were designed to be operated at , but due to noise complaints, JR West had to reduce its maximum speed to on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen (compared to for other &quot;Hikari&quot; services). From 11 March 2000, restaurant car services were discontinued on all trains, and from May 2002 onwards, the few remaining &quot;Grand Hikari&quot; services were limited to the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen only. The last &quot;Grand Hikari&quot; ran in November 2002.

===&quot;Family Hikari&quot;===
First appearing in the summer of 1995, these seasonal services operated between Shin-Ōsaka and Hakata during holiday periods using special 6-car 0 series sets (R2 and R24) which included a children&#x27;s play area in car 3. All seats were reserved on these services. 

===&quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot;===
JR West began operating the Hikari Rail Star service from the start of the new timetable on 11 March 2000. This service is limited to the Sanyo Shinkansen line, and uses special 8-car 700-7000 series trains with a distinctive livery and a maximum speed of . JR West introduced the service to provide better competition against airlines on the Osaka-Fukuoka route. These services do not have Green car accommodation, but the reserved seating cars feature 2+2 seating and also some 4-seat compartments instead of the standard 3+2 arrangement in non-reserved seating cars. The front row of seats in these cars feature power outlets for laptop users. With most &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; services being replaced by through Kyushu Shinkansen &quot;Sakura&quot; services from 12 March 2011, the 8-car 700 series sets used on the service have been running mostly on all-stations &quot;Kodama&quot; services on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen line. As of 14 March 2020, the &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; is the only special service variation to run on the &quot;Hikari&quot; service.

8-car 700 series &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; services are formed as follows with car 1 at the Hakata end and car 8 at the Shin-Osaka end. All cars are non-smoking.

==History==
Before and during World War II, &quot;Hikari&quot; was the name of an express train operated by Japan from Busan in Korea to Changchun in Manchuria.

The name &quot;Hikari&quot; was first introduced in Japan on 25 April 1958 for express services operating between Hakata and Beppu in Kyushu. This service operated until 30 September 1964, the day before the Tokaido Shinkansen opened.

When the Tokaido Shinkansen opened on 1 October 1964, the &quot;Hikari&quot; was the fastest train on the line, initially travelling from Tokyo Station to Shin-Osaka Station with only two stops (Nagoya and Kyoto). &quot;Hikari&quot; service was extended to the Sanyo Shinkansen later, although the &quot;Hikari&quot; trains were only slightly faster than the &quot;Kodama&quot; trains, earning them the derisive portmanteau nickname &quot;Hidama.&quot; The Hikari trains remained the fastest trains until the opening of &quot;Nozomi&quot; trains on 14 March 1992.

In March 2008, the new N700 Series Shinkansen was put into service on a morning &quot;Hikari&quot; service between Shin-Yokohama and Hiroshima stations, and a late night run between Tokyo and Nagoya. A third N700 &quot;Hikari&quot; run between Nagoya and Tokyo was added in October 2008, and a few other N700 &quot;Hikari&quot; runs have since been added.

From the start of the revised timetable on 17 March 2012, &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; services using 700 series 8-car E sets became entirely no-smoking.

As of 2012, JR Central &quot;Hikari&quot; services operating throughout the Tokaido/Sanyo corridor primarily use 16-car N700 series and 700 series sets. Most &quot;Hikari&quot; trains pull over at intermediate stations such as Shizuoka, Hamamatsu, Toyohashi, Maibara or Himeji to allow faster &quot;Nozomi&quot; services, to pass through without stopping.

In an announcement by JR Central, JR West, and JR Kyushu made on 17 October 2023, the companies stated that all onboard smoking rooms on the Tokaido, San&#x27;yo, and Kyushu Shinkansen trains would be discontinued by Q2 2024, which took effect on 16 March 2024. In addition, all smoking rooms located on station platforms on the aforementioned Shinkansen lines would also be discontinued.

<doc id="354248" wikidata="Q752539" url="?curid=354248" title="Melodious warbler">
<text>The melodious warbler (Hippolais polyglotta) is an Old World warbler in the tree warbler genus &quot;Hippolais&quot;. It breeds in southwest Europe and northwest Africa. It is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. This small passerine bird is a species found in open woodland with bushes. Three to five eggs are laid in a nest in a tree or a bush. This is a common bird in many parts of its wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Hippolais&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;hupolais&quot;, as misspelt by Linnaeus. It referred to a small bird mentioned by Aristotle and others and may be onomatopoeic or derived from &quot;hupo&quot;,&quot;under&quot;, and &quot;laas&quot;, &quot;stone&quot;. The specific &quot; polyglotta&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;polus&quot;, &quot;many&quot;, and &quot;glossa&quot;, &quot;tongue&quot; and means &quot;harmonious&quot;.

==Description==
This is a medium-sized warbler, in length, and similar to its eastern counterpart, the icterine warbler (&quot;Hippolais icterina&quot;). The adult has a plain brown back and wings, and yellowish underparts. Compared to the icterine warbler, the upper parts are rather browner and the under parts rather yellower. The bill is strong and pointed and the legs are brown. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are paler on the belly. The song is a pleasant babbling. Compared to that of the icterine it is more fluent and sustained but much less varied, and it does not include mimicked sounds. Other vocalisations include a rattling &quot;trrrr&quot;, which resembles a house sparrow, a quiet &quot;tuk&quot; and a chattering &quot;chret-chet&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The melodious warbler is a migratory species. It breeds in Western Europe and North Africa, and overwinters in West Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The breeding range extends from the Iberian Peninsula eastwards to Germany and Italy. In northern Africa it breeds in Western Sahara, Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. Its typical habitats include bushy woodland, forest edges, thickets, riverside vegetation, orchards and gardens.

==Ecology==
Like most warblers, it is mainly insectivorous, but will take other small food items, including berries. Three to five eggs are laid in a nest composed of fine grasses, stems, soft twigs, flakes of bark and lichen.

Stopping at every station, the &quot;Kodama&quot; is the slowest Shinkansen service for trips between major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. The Kodama trains are used primarily for travel to and from smaller cities such as Atami. Travelers between major cities generally take the &quot;Nozomi&quot; or &quot;Hikari&quot; services, which make fewer stops, although the &quot;Nozomi&quot; requires paying a supplement under the Japan Rail Pass while the &quot;Kodama&quot; does not, making these services an affordable alternative.

== Services ==
&quot;Kodama&quot; trains generally run over shorter distances than &quot;Nozomi&quot; and &quot;Hikari&quot; trains. Typical &quot;Kodama&quot; runs include Tokyo - Nagoya / Shin-Osaka, Tokyo - Mishima / Shizuoka / Hamamatsu, Mishima / Shizuoka / Nagoya - Shin-Osaka, and Shin-Osaka / Okayama / Hiroshima - Hakata as well as some shorter late-night runs.

The trainsets used for &quot;Kodama&quot; service are the same 700 series, and N700 series trains used for the &quot;Hikari&quot; and &quot;Nozomi&quot; services. Older 100 series and 300 series trains were also used for &quot;Kodama&quot; services on the Sanyō Shinkansen until they were withdrawn in 2012. In December 2008, reconfigured 500 series trains entered &quot;Kodama&quot; service to replace the withdrawn Sanyō Shinkansen 0 series trains. Many Sanyō Shinkansen &quot;Kodama&quot; services continue to and from Hakataminami on the Hakataminami Line.

Most &quot;Kodama&quot; trains have both reserved and non-reserved cars; however, some morning &quot;Kodama&quot; trains to Tokyo and evening trains departing Tokyo have non-reserved cars only to accommodate commuters living in Kanagawa and Shizuoka.

The newest shinkansen trainset, the N700, is currently used on some early morning and late night &quot;Kodama&quot; runs between Kokura and Hakata stations in Kyushu. All standard-class cars are non-reserved, and, as with all other N700 services, there is no smoking on these trains except in designated on-board smoking rooms.

At most intermediate stations, &quot;Kodama&quot; trains wait for faster trains, including the &quot;Nozomi&quot;, &quot;Hikari&quot;, &quot;Sakura&quot;, and &quot;Mizuho&quot;, to pass through before resuming their journeys.

== Stopping patterns (as of January 2024) ==
&quot;Kodama&quot; trains stop at all stations between Tokyo and Hakata. In order from east to west, this comprises , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .

==History==

===Limited express &quot;Kodama&quot;===

&quot;Kodama&quot; debuted as a limited express service on the Tokaido Main Line on 1 November 1958. Services used 151 series trainsets. This was the first EMU train service of the Japanese National Railways classified as a limited express, the highest (fastest) of train types on the national railway system. The train travelled between Tokyo Station and Osaka Station in six hours and 50 minutes and first enabled passengers to go and return between the two cities in one day. This is why the train was named &quot;Kodama&quot;, or echo.

A narrow gauge world speed record of 163 km/h was established by a 151 series &quot;Kodama&quot; trainset on 31 July 1959. The conventional &quot;Kodama&quot; train ran until 30 September 1964, the day before &quot;Kodama&quot; debuted on the Shinkansen.

===Shinkansen &quot;Kodama&quot;===
The shinkansen &quot;Kodama&quot; services began on 1 October 1964, operating between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka.

On 17 March 2012, the remaining 100 series (K) sets were withdrawn from &quot;Kodama&quot; services and 700 series (8-car E set) &quot;Kodama&quot; services became entirely no-smoking. Onboard trolley refreshment services were discontinued on all JR Central &quot;Kodama&quot; services from 17 March 2012. Also, some of the 16-car 500 series that used to run as the &quot;Nozomi&quot; service were cut short to eight cars to run as the &quot;Kodama&quot; service.

In an announcement by JR Central, JR West, and JR Kyushu made on 17 October 2023, the companies stated that all onboard smoking rooms on the Tokaido, San&#x27;yo, and Kyushu Shinkansen trains would be discontinued by Q2 2024; this took effect on 16 March 2024.

<doc id="354251" wikidata="Q27674" url="?curid=354251" title="Icterine warbler">
<text>The Icterine warbler (Hippolais icterina) is an Old World warbler in the tree warbler genus &quot;Hippolais&quot;. It breeds in mainland Europe except the southwest, where it is replaced by its western counterpart, the melodious warbler. It is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa.

==Description==
A fairly big warbler with a large head, broad-based bill and long wings with a quite short square-ended tail. The upperparts are greyish-green and the underparts are uniformly light yellow. It has pale lores and a rather vague yellowish supercilium with a pale eye ring. Other distinguishing features include a panel on the folded wings formed by pale edges to the secondary feathers and tertiary feathers and the grey, sometimes bluish legs.

==Habitat==
The icterine warbler is a bird of woodland rather than forest, preferring woodland edge or glades, favouring the crowns of well-spaced trees with tall undergrowth. It prefers broad-leafed trees, but may be found in conifers mixed with broad-leafed trees. It will use copses, orchards, parks, gardens, shelterbelts and tall hedges interspersed with trees.

==Voice==
The song is a fast nasal babbling incorporating mimicry of other species. The call is described as &quot;teck&quot; or &quot;tec, tec, tec&quot;.

==Distribution and movements==
The icterine warbler has the most northerly and widespread distribution of the four &quot;Hippolais&quot; species; its breeding range extends from northern France and Norway through most of northern and eastern Europe, south as far as the northern Balkans mountains and Crimea mountains eastwards in a narrowing band to the River Ob. It has bred in Scotland recently but it is normally a passage migrant in Great Britain and Ireland. There is a 2022 record of the Icterine warbler from Gambell, Alaska, and it was also documented in the state the following year.

It is a migratory species and the entire population winters in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly south of the equator. It begins its southward migration from late July, peaking in early August and then returns to the breeding range in late May.

==Biology==
The icterine warbler is mainly insectivorous but will feed on fruit in late summer. It forages among the foliage taking insects either on the leaves or fluttering, and it will flycatch. In general it is clumsier than the smaller but superficially similar &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; warblers. Rather solitary, it is territorial on both the breeding and wintering grounds. Four to six eggs are laid in a nest in a tree or a bush.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Hippolais&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;hupolais&quot;, as misspelt by Linnaeus. It referred to a small bird mentioned by Aristotle and others and may be onomatopoeic or derived from &quot;hupo&quot;,&quot;under&quot;, and &quot;laas&quot;, &quot;stone&quot;. The specific &quot;icterina&quot; is Greek for &quot;jaundice-yellow&quot;. &quot;Icterus&quot; was an old word for jaundice, and also referred to a yellowish-green bird, perhaps the golden oriole, the sight of which was believed to cure the disease. It is colloquially referred to by birders as &quot;icky&quot;.


The scientific name was also spelt as &quot;Hypolais icterina&quot;.

<doc id="354256" wikidata="Q333824" url="?curid=354256" title="William Sidney, 1st Viscount De L'Isle">
<text>William Philip Sidney, 1st Viscount De L&#x27;Isle (23 May 1909 – 5 April 1991), known as Lord De L&#x27;Isle and Dudley between 1945 and 1956, was a British Army officer, politician and Victoria Cross recipient who served as the 15th governor-general of Australia, in office from 1961 to 1965. He was the last non-Australian to hold the position.

Sidney was born into an aristocratic family and attended Eton College before going on to Magdalene College, Cambridge. He became a chartered accountant, but also joined the Territorial Army. During the Second World War, Sidney served with the Grenadier Guards in France and Italy; he was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1944 for his actions in the Battle of Anzio. He was elected to the House of Commons later that year, as a member of the Conservative Party.

In 1945, Sidney succeeded his father as Baron De L&#x27;Isle and Dudley, consequently being elevated to the House of Lords. He served as Secretary of State for Air from 1951 to 1955, under Winston Churchill, and was raised to the viscountcy in 1956. Lord De L&#x27;Isle became governor-general in 1961 on the recommendation of Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia. He served for just under four years with little controversy; as well as being the last British governor-general of Australia, he was also the last to wear the traditional vice-regal uniform.

==Early life==
Sidney was the younger of two children, and the only son, of William Sidney, 5th Baron De L&#x27;Isle and Dudley (19 August 1859 – 18 June 1945), and his wife, Winifred Agneta Yorke Bevan (died 11 February 1959). He was a descendant of William IV by his mistress Dorothea Jordan. He was educated at Eton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, and became a chartered accountant. In 1929 he joined the Grenadier Guards Reserve of Officers.

==War service==
During the Second World War, Sidney fought in the Battle of France and the Italian Campaign. While serving as a company commander in the 5th Battalion, Grenadier Guards (itself part of 24th Guards Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division), he led a handful of men in the defence of the Anzio beachhead in February 1944, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. Sidney led a successful attack which drove German troops of the 147th Grenadier Regiment out of a gully. Later he led another counter-attack and dashed forward, engaging the Germans with his tommy gun at point-blank range, forcing a withdrawal. When the attack was renewed, Sidney and one guardsman were wounded and another killed, but he would not consent to have his wounds dressed until the Germans had been beaten off and the battalion&#x27;s position had been consolidated. During this time, although extremely weak from loss of blood, he continued to encourage and inspire his men.

In later life, when asked where he had been shot, he would jocularly respond that he was shot in Italy. This was to conceal that he had been shot in the buttocks. The ribbon for the medal was made from one of his father-in-law Lord Gort&#x27;s uniforms and was awarded by General Sir Harold Alexander, commanding the Allied Armies in Italy, on 3 March 1944 in Italy.

==Political life==
At a by-election in October 1944, he was elected unopposed to the House of Commons as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Chelsea. He succeeded Samuel Hoare as the member for Chelsea; the vacancy had been created because Hoare had been elevated to the House of Lords. 

His father died in June 1945 and he succeeded as 6th Baron De L&#x27;Isle and Dudley, requiring transition to the House of Lords. He thus retired from the House of Commons prior to the July 1945 general election.

In 1951 he was appointed Secretary of State for Air under Winston Churchill and held that office until 1955. During this time he visited Australia, travelling to Woomera to examine weapons research and meeting the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. In 1956 he was created Viscount De L&#x27;Isle, of Penshurst in the County of Kent.

==Governor-General==
Following the death in office of Lord Dunrossil in February 1961, Prime Minister Robert Menzies recommended De L&#x27;Isle as his military honours, aristocratic background, and political experience apparently made him, according to one author, Menzies&#x27; &quot;vision of ideal governor-general material&quot;. De L&#x27;Isle was sworn in on 3 August 1961. He continued Dunrossil&#x27;s revival of the full ceremonial vice-regal uniform, but would be the last governor-general to do so. De L&#x27;Isle faced no constitutional issues during his time in office; the Official Secretary throughout his term was Murray Tyrrell.

De L&#x27;Isle was the first governor-general since William McKell (1947–1953) to have children living at Yarralumla, and this made him popular with the general public. However, his wife fell ill in his first year of office, and died on 16 November 1962, aged 48. Despite this, he chose to continue in office until the expiry of Dunrossil&#x27;s original five-year term in 1965. Two of his daughters, Catherine and Anne, acted as the official hostesses in place of their mother.

==Retirement and death==
By the time of his retirement in 1965, public opinion was strongly in favour of an Australian Governor-General, although this was not a reflection on his performance in the role. His continuing interest in Australia was shown by several visits after his retirement, the last for Australia&#x27;s bicentenary in 1988 when he presented a bronze statue, which now stands in the grounds of Government House in Canberra.

In 1975 he co-founded what is now called The Freedom Association, a free-market campaign group opposed to the post-war consensus that played a prominent role in the Grunwick Dispute.

Viscount De L&#x27;Isle died in Kent on 5 April 1991 and was buried in the Sidney family vault at St John the Baptist, Penshurst. He was the last surviving Victoria Cross recipient who had been a member of both Houses of Parliament. He was succeeded in his titles by his only son, Philip.

<text>Azúcar Moreno (; Spanish for &quot;brown sugar&quot;) is a Spanish music duo composed of sisters Antonia &quot;Toñi&quot; and Encarnación &quot;Encarna&quot; Salazar. The duo has sold more than three million albums and singles since 1984 domestically, and became famous in Europe, the United States and Latin America in the 1990s, with approximately twelve million albums sold worldwide.

==Biography==
Consisting of sisters Antonia &quot;Toñi&quot; (14 March 1963) and Encarnación &quot;Encarna&quot; Salazar (10 January 1961), the singing duo comes from Badajoz. They are part of a large family of performers: their grandfather was a musician, their father a singer and songwriter, their brothers the members of band Los Chunguitos and their uncle is famous singer Porrina de Badajoz. The Azúcar Moreno sisters began their singing careers as back-up vocalists to their brothers, but in 1982, they were discovered and signed by record label EMI Spain, resulting in two albums with moderate commercial success released in 1984 and 1986. In 1988 they signed with CBS-Epic and relaunched their music with a bolder production style and matching sexier image and released the album &quot;Carne De Melocotón&quot;. They became one of the first Spanish acts to combine their Romani heritage and traditional &quot;cantaora&quot; vocal style with urban dance rhythms like disco, rhythm and blues, funk and techno. One of their first hit singles was a house music remix of the track &quot;Aunque Me Falte El Aire&quot;, released in 1988. A full-length remix album &quot;Mix In Spain&quot; was released in 1989 and the follow-up single &quot;Debajo Del Olivo&quot; also became a minor club hit in Continental Europe.

Azúcar Moreno had their commercial breakthrough in Continental Europe and Latin America after singing their song &quot;Bandido&quot;, written and produced by prolific Spanish dance producer Raul Orellana, at the Eurovision Song Contest 1990. Unfortunately, the start of their performance was marred by sound problems at the arena in Zagreb. &quot;Bandido&quot; went out as entry number one of twenty-two participating countries. The contest was broadcast live to an audience of approximately 500 million viewers - but due to a tape technician not starting the pre-recorded backing track in time both the singers, their band and the live orchestra missed their cues. This resulted in the sisters finally having to walk off stage, make a second entrance and start the song and their dance routine all over. In his book &quot;The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History&quot;, British Eurovision historian John Kennedy O&#x27;Connor in turn describes the incident as &quot;every artist&#x27;s worst nightmare&quot;. Despite this very unfortunate debacle &quot;Bandido&quot; finished an honourable fifth and the song and its accompanying album, also including follow-up single &quot;Devórame Otra Vez&quot;, became the starting point of the duo&#x27;s international career.
During the following years, Encarna and Toñi Salazar had the opportunity to work with top producers Emilio Estefan and Estéfano, recording in both the United Kingdom and the United States, achieving a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award for Best Latin Group and becoming one of the top-selling artists in the Hispanic pop scene. 1991&#x27;s &quot;Mambo&quot; became their commercial break-through in Japan and the title track of their 1994 album &quot;El Amor&quot; was featured in Luis Llosa&#x27;s movie &quot;The Specialist&quot;.

On their following albums Azúcar Moreno widened their repertoire as they combined original material sung in their typical flamenco vocal style with traditional folk songs like the Chilean &quot;Yo Vendos Unos Ojos Negros&quot;, the Italian &quot;&#x27;O sole mio&quot; and the Hebrew &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;, influences from other Latin and Caribbean genres like rhumba, mambo, bolero, merengue, reggaeton, salsa and dancehall, as well as Spanish language versions of rock and pop classics like the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Paint It, Black&quot;, Jackie Wilson&#x27;s &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot; and The Animals&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;.

As of 2006, Azúcar Moreno had released some 40 singles, 13 studio albums as well as a large number of hits compilations. Their greatest hit to date was &quot;Solo Se Vive Una Vez&quot; (translated as &quot;You only live once&quot;), which topped the charts in Spain as well as a number of countries in South and Central America. In the 2000s (decade) the track was included on the first Spanish language versions of karaoke video game SingStar. Azúcar Moreno are one of the best selling acts in the history of Spanish popular music, with combined sales of approximately 2 million albums in their native Spain alone and it also makes them one of the most commercially successful acts alongside Sweden&#x27;s ABBA, Canada&#x27;s Céline Dion, and the UK&#x27;s Bucks Fizz to have their international breakthrough via the Eurovision Song Contest.
The Salazar sisters have been the target of much gossip and some of their songs have been slightly controversial in their homeland. Many of their fans see some of their songs as having feminist content, and the duo has been prominently featured on the covers of Spanish tabloid magazines since the early 1990s. The sisters also have a strong gay following in Spain, their 2000 album &quot;Amén&quot; included a torch ballad especially dedicated to their loyal LGBT fans, &quot;Amigo Mío&quot;, and later they also recorded high camp songs like &quot;Divina De La Muerte&quot; and &quot;Sobreviviré&quot;, the latter a flamenco version of Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s gay anthem &quot;I Will Survive&quot;.

In 2006, Azúcar Moreno returned to EMI after 18 years with CBS-Sony and were considered one of the top artists to represent Spain again in the Eurovision Song Contest. Ultimately RTVE&#x27;s choice fell upon Las Ketchup, feeling the sisters&#x27; tribute to legendary Spanish singer, dancer, and actress Lola Flores, &quot;Bailando con Lola&quot; (&quot;Dancing with Lola&quot;), was too flamenco-flavoured. Nevertheless, as Toñi and Encarna sing in the opening song &quot;20 Años&quot; on the &quot;Bailando Con Lola&quot; album: &quot;It&#x27;s been 20 years / Nothing else / 20 years of singing / And we&#x27;ve still got so much to give ...&quot;

On November 28, 2007, Toñi Salazár announced to the Spanish media that the duo &quot;would withdraw from the music scene until further notice&quot; due to her sister Encarna having been diagnosed with breast cancer and was to go undergo chemotherapy and then needed time for recuperation.

In September 2008 it was announced that Encarna Salazar had made a full recovery and had been given a clean bill of health but also that there were no immediate plans for the two sisters to continue their musical careers as a duo due to personal differences.

In October 2013 the duo reunited in the TV show &quot;Tu Cara Me Suena&quot; after 5 years being apart as Azúcar Moreno and as sisters. In the show their brothers Los Chunguitos were participating that season (Antonia from Azucar Moreno had participated in the show&#x27;s first season in 2011) and Antonia and Encarna were invited as judges to see Los Chunguitos impersonate them singing &quot;Bandido&quot;. Antonia appeared first and then Encarna appeared as a surprise inside a huge box. Both sisters had a lovely reunion where they hugged and announced the return of Azucar Moreno for 2014 and that both fixed their differences.

At the beginning of 2014 they began touring Spain and making TV performances again, they released their first single in 8 years “Punto De Partida”. In 2015 they released another new single “Pegaíto”. In 2016 they released a remake of their hit song “Debajo Del Olivo” with new vocals and a new sound and released it with a new song “Agarraita A La Vida”. In 2018 They released another single “No Me Des Guerra” which is a cover song and they released a music video for it, their first music video in 12 years.

In October 2019 Azúcar Moreno announced their new album “El Secreto” and released the first single with the same name. In 2020 during the 2020 pandemic they released 4 more singles, “Pa’ Fuera”, “Love Is Love” (Proceeds for this single went to charities to fight COVID-19), “Soy Yo”, and “La Cura”. They made several TV performances and radio interviews to promote the album and singles.

On September 4, 2020, the album “El Secreto” was finally released with 9 brand new songs, they also made pre-orders for signed physical copies of the album online, it was their first album in almost 15 years after 2006&#x27;s “Bailando Con Lola”.

In January 2022 the duo took part in Benidorm Fest with their song &quot;Postureo&quot;, hoping to represent Spain at the Eurovision Song Contest 2022, however they failed to qualify to the final of the contest, ending up 5th on the first semi-final.

In 2022 their eurovision song “Bandido” was featured in the Australian movie Of an age

In 2023 they released a cover of Rigoberta Bandini&#x27;s “Ay Mamá”, which was Rigoberta&#x27;s song for Benidorm Fest 2022 and competed with “Postureo”.

In 2024 it will be the 40th anniversary of Azucar Moreno, both Toñi and Encarna have said they will have some announcements through the year to celebrate the occasion.

<text>[[Serbia and Montenegro]] consisted of two republics, Serbia with its capital in Belgrade and Montenegro with its capital in Podgorica.

==Serbia==

Serbia had two autonomous provinces (&quot;autonomna pokrajina&quot; / аутономна покрајина):
* Vojvodina with its capital in Novi Sad and
* Kosovo and Metohija with its capital in Priština (under UN 1999-2006)

The part of Serbia that was in neither (often called &quot;Central Serbia&quot;) was not a province and had no special status. It had no capital nor a governing body.

Independently of this division, Serbia was further divided into 29 districts (&quot;okrug&quot; / округ) and the city of Belgrade. Each of districts (and the city) was further divided into municipalities (општина / &quot;opština&quot;).

==Montenegro==

Montenegro was divided into 21 municipalities (&quot;opština&quot; / општина).

He was known for his many contributions to the area of software engineering.

In 1996, Boehm was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to computer and software architectures and to models of cost, quality, and risk for aerospace systems.

==Biography==
Boehm was born on May 16, 1935. He received a BA in mathematics from Harvard University in 1957, and an MS in 1961, and PhD from UCLA in 1964, both in mathematics as well. He also received honorary Sc.D. in Computer Science from the U. of Massachusetts in 2000 and in Software Engineering from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2011.

In 1955 he started working as a programmer-analyst at General Dynamics. In 1959 he switched to the RAND Corporation, where he was head of the Information Sciences Department until 1973. From 1973 to 1989 he was chief scientist of the Defense Systems Group at TRW Inc. From 1989 to 1992 he served within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) as director of the DARPA Information Science and Technology Office, and as director of the DDR&amp;E Software and Computer Technology Office. From 1992 he was TRW Professor of Software Engineering, Computer Science Department, and director, USC Center for Systems and Software Engineering, formerly Center for Software Engineering.

He served on the board of several scientific journals, including the &quot;IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering&quot;, &quot;Computer&quot;, &quot;IEEE Software&quot;, &quot;ACM Computing Reviews&quot;, &quot;Automated Software Engineering&quot;, &quot;Software Process&quot;, and &quot;Information and Software Technology&quot;.

==Awards==
Later awards for Boehm included the Office of the Secretary of Defense Award for Excellence in 1992, the ASQC Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, the ACM Distinguished Research Award in Software Engineering in 1997, and the IEEE International Stevens Award. He was an AIAA Fellow, an ACM Fellow, an IEEE Fellow, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1996). He received the Mellon Award for Excellence in Mentoring in 2005 and the IEEE Simon Ramo Medal in 2010. He was appointed a distinguished professor on January 13, 2014.

He was awarded the INCOSE Pioneer Award in 2019 by the International Council on Systems Engineering for significant pioneering contributions to the field of systems engineering.

==Work==
Boehm&#x27;s research interests included software development process modeling, software requirements engineering, software architectures, software metrics and cost models, software engineering environments, and knowledge-based software engineering.

His contributions to the field, according to Boehm (1997) himself, include &quot;the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO), the spiral model of the software process, the Theory W (win-win) approach to software management and requirements determination and two advanced software engineering environments: the TRW Software Productivity System and Quantum Leap Environment&quot;.

===Software versus hardware costs===
In an important 1973 report entitled &quot;Ada - The Project : The DoD High Order Language Working Group&quot; to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Boehm predicted that software costs would overwhelm hardware costs. DARPA had expected him to predict that hardware would remain the biggest problem, encouraging them to invest in even larger computers. The report inspired a change of direction in computing.

===Software economics===
Boehm&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;Software Engineering Economics&quot; documents his Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO). It relates software development effort for a program, in Person-Months (PM), to &quot;Thousand Source Lines of Code&quot; (KSLOC).

Where A is a calibration constant based on project data and B is an exponent for the software diseconomy of scale.

*Note: since man-years are not interchangeable with years, Brooks&#x27; Law applies:
**&quot;Adding programmers to a late project makes it later&quot;.
**Thus this formula is best applied to stable software development teams which have completed multiple projects.

===Spiral model===

Boehm also created the spiral model of software development, in which the phases of development are repeatedly revisited. This iterative software development process influenced MBASE and extreme programming.

===Wideband Delphi===
Boehm refined the Delphi method of estimation to include more group iteration, making it more suitable for certain classes of problems, such as software development. This variant is called the Wideband Delphi method.

===Incremental Commitment Model===
The Incremental Commitment Model (ICM) is a system design, developmental, and evolution process for 21 century systems. The systems&#x27; types cover a wide range from COTS based systems to &quot;routine&quot; Information Systems to human intensive and life or safety critical.

Boehm then reconciled the ICM with the WinWin Spiral Model and its incarnation in MBASE and the follow-on Lean MBASE, and worked towards an Incremental Commitment Model for Software (ICMS) by adapting the existing WinWin Spiral Model support tools.
In 2008, the evolving ICM for Software with its risk-driven anchor point decisions, proved very useful to several projects which ended up having unusual life cycle phase sequences.

<text>Kleptoparasitism (originally spelt clepto-parasitism, meaning &quot;parasitism by theft&quot;) is a form of feeding in which one animal deliberately takes food from another. The strategy is evolutionarily stable when stealing is less costly than direct feeding, such as when food is scarce or when victims are abundant. Many kleptoparasites are arthropods, especially bees and wasps, but including some true flies, dung beetles, bugs, and spiders. Cuckoo bees are specialized kleptoparasites which lay their eggs either on the pollen masses made by other bees, or on the insect hosts of parasitoid wasps. They are an instance of Emery&#x27;s rule, which states that insect social parasites tend to be closely related to their hosts. The behavior occurs, too, in vertebrates including birds such as skuas, which persistently chase other seabirds until they disgorge their food, and carnivorous mammals such as spotted hyenas and lions. Other species opportunistically indulge in kleptoparasitism.

== Strategy ==

Kleptoparasitism is a feeding strategy where one animal deliberately steals food from another. This may be intraspecific, involving stealing from members of the same species, or interspecific, from members of other species. The term denotes a form of parasitism involving theft, from Greek κλέπτω (kléptō, &#x27;steal&#x27;). The strategy has been widely studied in birds; in four families, all seabirds, the Fregatidae, Chionididae, Stercoraridae, and Laridae, it occurs in more than a quarter of the species.

Such a strategy should be followed only if it is evolutionarily stable, meaning that it offers a selective advantage to individuals that practise it. Kleptoparasitism costs time and energy which could otherwise be spent directly on feeding, so this cost must be outweighed by the benefit in energy gained from the stolen food. Mathematical modelling suggests that when food is abundant, ordinary feeding is the best strategy; when food abundance falls below a critical level, kleptoparasitism suddenly becomes advantageous, and aggressive interactions become common. Similarly, when potential victims are rare or widely dispersed, the time needed to find them may not be justified by the food that might be stolen from them, resulting in frequency-dependent selection.

== Taxonomic distribution ==

=== Arthropods ===

==== Bees and wasps ====
There are many lineages of cuckoo bees, all of which lay their eggs in the nest cells of other bees, often within the same family. &quot;Bombus bohemicus&quot;, for example, parasitises several other species in its genus, including &quot;B. terrestris&quot;, &quot;B. lucorum&quot;, and &quot;B. cryptarum&quot;. These are instances of Emery&#x27;s rule, named for the Italian entomologist Carlo Emery, which asserts that social parasites among insects, including kleptoparasites, tend to be closely related to their hosts. The largest monophyletic lineage of kleptoparasitic bees is Nomadinae (a subfamily of Apidae), which comprises several hundred species in 35 genera.

The cuckoo wasps (Chrysididae) lay their eggs in the nests of potter and mud dauber wasps. Other families of wasps have &quot;cuckoo&quot; species that parasitise related species, as for example &quot;Polistes sulcifer&quot;, which parasitises a related species, &quot;P. dominula&quot;. Numerous other wasp families have genera or larger lineages of which some or all members are kleptoparasitic (e.g., the genus &quot;Ceropales&quot; in Pompilidae and the tribe Nyssonini in Crabronidae). Some of these species are inquilines and brood parasites rather than kleptoparasites. 

Others are dubbed kleptoparasitoids, namely parasitoids that select hosts that have been parasitized by another female. Kleptoparasitoids may make use of the punctures made by previous parasitoids on their hosts; may follow the trails or traces left by parasitoids to locate hosts; or use hosts already weakened by other parasitoids.

==== Flies ====

Some true flies (Diptera) are kleptoparasites; the strategy is especially common in the subfamily Miltogramminae of the family Sarcophagidae. There are also some kleptoparasites in the families Chloropidae and Milichiidae. Some adult milichiids, for example, visit spider webs where they scavenge on half-eaten stink bugs. Others are associated with robber flies (Asilidae), or &quot;Crematogaster&quot; ants. Flies in the genus &quot;Bengalia&quot; (Calliphoridae) steal food and pupae transported by ants and are often found beside their foraging trails. &quot;Musca albina&quot; (Muscidae) reportedly shows kleptoparasitic behaviour, laying eggs only in dung balls being interred by one of several co-occurring dung-rolling scarab species.

==== Dung beetles ====

Scarab dung beetles relocate large amounts of vertebrate dung, rolling balls of the material to their nests for their larvae to feed on. Several smaller species of dung beetle do not gather dung themselves but take it from the nests of larger species. For example, species of &quot;Onthophagus&quot; enter dung-balls while &quot;Scarabeus&quot; beetles are making them.

==== True bugs ====
Many semiaquatic bugs (Heteroptera) are kleptoparasitic on their own species. In one study, whenever the bug &quot;Velia caprai&quot; (water cricket) took prey heavier than 7.9 g, other bugs of the same species joined it and successfully ate parts of the prey.

==== Spiders ====
Kleptoparasitic spiders, which steal or feed on prey captured by other spiders, are known to occur in five families:
* Theridiidae (&quot;Argyrodes&quot; species)
* Dictynidae (&quot;Archaeodictyna ulova&quot;)
* Salticidae (species of &quot;Portia&quot; and &quot;Simaetha&quot;)
* Symphytognathidae (&quot;Curimagua bayano&quot;)
* Mysmenidae (&quot;Isela okuncana&quot;, &quot;Isela inquilina&quot;, and &quot;Mysmenopsis&quot; species).

=== Vertebrates ===

==== Birds ====

A few bird species are specialist kleptoparasites, while many others are opportunistic. Skuas (including jaegers) and frigatebirds rely heavily on chasing other seabirds to obtain food. Other species—including raptors, gulls, terns, coots, and some ducks and shorebirds—do so opportunistically. Among opportunists such as the roseate tern, parent birds involved in kleptoparasitism are more successful in raising broods than non-kleptoparasitic individuals. Bald eagles have been seen attacking smaller raptors, such as ospreys, to steal fish from them. Among passerine birds, masked shrikes have been recorded stealing food from wheatears, and Eurasian blackbirds have been recorded stealing smashed snails from other thrushes.

During seabird nesting seasons, frigatebirds soar above seabird colonies, waiting for parent birds to return to their nests with food for their young. As the returning birds approach the colony, the frigatebirds, which are fast and agile, swoop in to pursue them vigorously; they sometimes seize tropicbirds by their long tail plumes. The name &quot;frigatebird&quot;, as well as many of the frigatebirds&#x27; colloquial names, including &quot;man-o&#x27;-war bird&quot; and &quot;pirate of the sea&quot;, denote this behaviour. However, the amount of food obtained by kleptoparasitism in the magnificent frigatebird may be marginal.

Gulls are both perpetrators and victims of opportunistic kleptoparasitism, particularly during the breeding season. While the victim is most often another member of the same species, other (principally smaller) gulls and terns can also be targeted. In the Americas, as brown pelicans surface and empty the water from their bills, they sometimes have their food stolen by Heermann&#x27;s gulls and laughing gulls, which lurk nearby and grab escaping food items. Great black-backed gulls are skilled kleptoparasites, stealing from other gulls and from raptors. Several species of gull steal food from humans, for example takeaway food at seaside resorts.


==== Mammals ====
The relationship between spotted hyenas and lions, in which each species steals the other&#x27;s kills, is a form of kleptoparasitism. Cheetahs are common targets. Bears, coyotes and wolves are very opportunistic and all have this behavior. Crab-eating macaques have also exhibited kleptoparasitic behaviors. All hyena species engage in this behavior when they can, as do jackals. Human hunters may commonly take the remains of fresh kills from other carnivores, such as lions and Eurasian lynx. Risso&#x27;s dolphins have been observed charging &quot;head-on&quot; at sperm whales, causing them to open their mouths; it has been suggested that the observed harassment results in some regurgitation, and that the food is then eaten by the Risso&#x27;s dolphins. The behaviour is rare and may be opportunistic.

<text>Surfest is an annual surfing competition held in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. Surfest began in 1985 as an initiative of Newcastle City Council, and at the time, was the world&#x27;s richest surfing competition. The event runs for thirteen days, and from the 2007 event, has been held at Merewether Beach, having been held between Newcastle Beach and South Newcastle Beach in the past.

Surfest adopted a festival-style approach in 2015, with smaller, more official events held on surrounding beaches in the lead-up to the main event.

<text>Mark Richards (born 7 March 1957), known as MR, is an Australian surfer who became a four-time world champion (1979–1982).

==Youth==
Mark Richards was born and raised in Newcastle, son of Ray and Val Richards, both keen beachgoers. They worked at the Wire Rope Works, Ray Richards as an accountant, but he wanted more than that career could offer and started a business selling second-hand cars at a time when new cars were too expensive for most people. Together they set up a showroom at the front of Hunter St and lived in an apartment above it.

In the late 1950s Ray saw the new balsa and fibreglass mailbu surfboards, which Greg Noll and other visiting Californians had brought with them in 1956. The new boards were shorter and more manoeuvrable than the solid timber boards used until then. He bought himself one, and when he saw how much it impressed people he made a decision to branch into selling them too, buying from early manufacturers in Sydney. So the business came a combination car yard and surf shop, and in time the cars gave way to the surfboards and it became a dedicated surf shop, one of the first in Australia.

So when Mark was born in 1957 he was always around surfboards, growing up with surf-o-planes and pint-sized longboards. He learnt to surf in gentle waves at Blacksmiths Beach, about 15 minutes south of Newcastle, a beach partly sheltered by the breakwater on the northern side of the entrance to Lake Macquarie. The family also went to Rainbow Bay on Queensland&#x27;s Gold Coast for holidays, where he surfed Snapper Rocks. He was also very keen on cricket when young.

Richards surfed many junior competitions around Australia, taking time off school to go in some cases. He also made trips to Hawaii for winter on the North Shore as a teenager. The highlight of his junior career was a win at Margaret River in 1973.

In mid-1973 Richards father allowed him to leave school midway through fifth form, to pursue surfing. Anyone could leave after fourth form, but that was usually to take up an apprenticeship. To leave for surfing was radical at a time when surfers were regarded as long-haired layabouts. The deal with his father was that if it didn&#x27;t work out in a year then he had to get a trade.

== Early career ==
At the end of 1974 Richards returned to Hawaii for the North Shore winter. This was his fourth trip, and his first taste of really big waves. He got a late entry into a contest at Waimea Bay, and did well enough on the first day of competition to make the semi-finals the next day. That day the surf had jumped and 30-foot clean-up sets were closing out the Bay. Even local big wave riders were saying it was too big to compete. Organiser and 1968 world title holder Fred Hemmings had other ideas; with sunshine, offshore winds and television coverage he threatened to go out himself if nobody else wanted to.

Richards made a decision to go. At 17 years old and without Waimea experience nobody would have thought less of him if he didn&#x27;t, but he felt to walk away would end his hopes of surfing professionally, and put him back in Newcastle at some unappealing apprenticeship. He went with survival uppermost in his mind, and reckoned his first wave twice as big as anything he&#x27;d surfed before. By the end of the heat he was game enough on the monsters to actually bottom turn, yet was glad not to reach the final and have to go back out. In time he came to enjoy big waves, without being regarded as a big-wave specialist.

Image was important for Richards, and in 1975 he had Hawaiian artist Albert Dove design a superman-style badge with &quot;MR&quot; inscribed in it. He used that logo on all his boards and wetsuits for most of his career.

Richards was interested in twin-fin surfboards and in shaping. At the Surfabout in 1976 he saw Reno Abellira on a highly manoeuvrable twin-fin fish and thought something like that would be better than a single-fin for small waves. Back in Hawaii again for the 1976/77 winter, aged 19, he took his father&#x27;s suggestion to pay for shaping lessons from noted pioneer Dick Brewer. It meant Richards was able to put his thoughts about design into actual foam. He credits Brewer for the style of shaping he came to use.

Brewer made Richards a twin-fin, and Richards took aspects of that and Abellira&#x27;s fish for his own designs. The result was boards faster and more manoeuvrable than the single-fins of the day.

== Professional career ==
By 1979 Richards reckoned his career as shaping primarily, and just competing at home in Australia and in Hawaii where he would go for the northern winter anyway.

In Australia that year he had a strong win at the Stubbies, and another strong win in small waves at Bells Beach, but couldn&#x27;t make a clean sweep at the Surfabout (relocated to Bells that year). The tour went to Niijima in Japan, the first time tour events had been held in Japan. Richards was not focused on title ratings points and might not have gone except he had a Japanese sponsor. In four events there in small waves Richards got a 1st, a 2nd and two 5ths, which put him well in the ratings lead.

Richards didn&#x27;t go to the two-event South African leg, instead returning to Australia to make boards. Past world title winners hadn&#x27;t reaped any great financial reward, so he reckoned he was better off putting his shaping first. So going into the last two events in Hawaii his lead had evaporated.

Richards came 4th in the Pipe Masters at Banzai Pipeline, which advanced him against Wayne Bartholomew and Cheyne Horan when they made early exits. Then at the World Cup at Haleiwa fortune smiled on him in good 6–8-foot swell. Bartholomew went out early, and another contender Dane Keoloha made a tactical error of waiting for big sets which didn&#x27;t come and was out. It came down to the final, which was Peter Townend against Richards. If Townend won then Horan got the world title, and if Richards won then he got it.

In that final the two jostled for the inside position, both stubborn and wasting time out well past the break. His girlfriend (later wife) Jenny Jobson had arrived in Hawaii just in time for the final and thought he was going to be so stubborn that he&#x27;d give up the title rather than give up the inside. Finally Richards reckoned he was not in the lead and had to get some waves. He was so nervous he fell on a couple, but in the end did enough to take the win and take the title he hadn&#x27;t even intended competing for.

The title presentation was in Haleiwa, and consisted only of a Rolex watch and a plaque with a Pan Am logo. But &quot;Surfing Magazine&quot; gave him the honour of a head-shot on the cover instead of their normal action shot, commissioned from rock photographer Norman Seef in Los Angeles.

For 1980 Richards changed his strategy, and set out deliberately to get a second world title, doing the full tour. Although he&#x27;d won the ratings in 1979 he wasn&#x27;t universally thought the best surfer, with Dane Kealoha reckoned the best by many. Richards was also competing against Wayne Bartholomew, Cheyne Horan and Peter Townend. In the end his results were very strong and took the 1980 title by a record number of points, and ended the season as the surfer against whom others were judged.

Richards won in 1981 and 1982 too, with his chief rival being Cheyne Horan.

In 1982 Richards&#x27; main sponsor, Lightning Bolt, suddenly dropped him. The reason was a mystery, he&#x27;d just won his fourth world title and was at the peak of his popularity, but they declined to renew for another year. The Lightning Bolt Australia division reckoned that treatment shabby and signed him up for several years. It turned out the parent company was in severe financial trouble, and it in fact folded, putting most of its Hawaiian staff out of work.

Right through Richards&#x27; career his parents went with him to see him compete, within Australia at least. They preferred sitting in among the crowd, no doubt a little out of place among the teenagers and surfie types, even though they would have been welcome in the VIP areas. Richards and his parents were close and he would celebrate a win by having a meal with them, a marked contrast to surf and party animals of the time.

== Semi-retirement ==
For 1983 and following years Richards chose not to defend his title, and to travel and compete less, due to back troubles and the pressure of being on top. It turned out he was unable to compete for 1982 anyway, an ankle injury on a big day at home at Dixon Park kept him on dry land for five months.

Richards had suffered back problems throughout his career. His legs were a little shorter and trunk a little longer than usual which meant that he tended to pivot not at the hips but a couple of vertebrae up, straining the ligaments surrounding them. He reckoned a poor diet and lack of stretching or exercise (apart from surfing) hadn&#x27;t helped either.

His back had developed a reverse curvature, with the lower vertebrae sticking out noticeably. He required regular physiotherapy to keep it mobile, and in later years it worsened to the point of making him something of a weekend surfer, since too much would aggravate it, obviously a very frustrating situation for a surfer.

Today Richards still lives in Newcastle with his wife, Jenny, and three children, Kyle, Nathan and Grace. He runs the Mark Richards Surf Shop in Hunter St, the same shop started by his parents.

==Honours==
Richards was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. He received a Medal of the Order of Australia in 1994, an Australian Sports Medal in 2000, and a Centenary Medal in 2001.

== Trivia ==

* Richards&#x27; nickname was &quot;the wounded seagull,&quot; due to his tall frame, and unusual style of making bottom turns and cutbacks with his arms splayed out awkwardly behind his back.

* Richards is the Godfather to Nicky Wood who is the youngest to ever win an ASP professional surfing competition at 16 years of age. The Bells Beach Surf Classic.
* MR was also a big Bruce Springsteen fan.
* MR owned a Porsche 911/935 style vehicle.

<doc id="354281" wikidata="Q256738" url="?curid=354281" title="Linn Ullmann">
<text>Karin Beate &quot;Linn&quot; Ullmann (born 9 August 1966) is a Norwegian author and journalist. A prominent literary critic, she also writes a column for Norway&#x27;s leading morning newspaper and has published six novels.

==Early life==
Ullmann was born in Oslo, Norway, to Norwegian actress, author and director Liv Ullmann and Swedish director and screenwriter Ingmar Bergman. She grew up in New York City and Oslo.

Ullmann attended Professional Children&#x27;s School in Manhattan. When she was fifteen, she was &quot;kicked out&quot; (as she puts it) of the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet. She attended Juilliard School as a prospective dancer and graduated from New York University, where she studied English literature and began work on her PhD.

==Career==
When her first and critically acclaimed novel &quot;Before You Sleep&quot; was published in 1998, she was already known as an influential literary critic. Her second novel, &quot;Stella Descending&quot; was published in 2001 and her third novel &quot;Grace&quot; was published in 2002. For &quot;Grace&quot;, Ullmann received the literary award The Readers&#x27; Prize in Norway, and &quot;Grace&quot; was named one of the top ten novels that year by the prestigious newspaper &quot;Weekendavisen&quot; in Denmark. In 2007, &quot;Grace&quot; was longlisted for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in the United Kingdom, and in March the same year, the Norwegian theater Riksteatret played a successful run of the theatrical play &quot;Grace&quot;, based on the novel.

Ullmann&#x27;s fourth novel &quot;A Blessed Child&quot; was published in Norway the fall of 2005, and it was shortlisted for the prestigious Norwegian literature prize – the Brage Prize. In 2007, she was awarded the Amalie Skram Award for her literary work, and she received Gullpennen (the Golden Pen) for her journalism in Norway&#x27;s leading morning newspaper &quot;Aftenposten&quot;. In 2008, &quot;A Blessed Child&quot; was named Best Translated novel in the British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, and in 2009 the novel was longlisted for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in the UK and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in Ireland. Ullmann&#x27;s novels are published throughout Europe and the United States and are translated into 30 languages.

Ullmann is co-founder (2009) and former artistic director of the international artist residency foundation The Bergman Estate on Fårö.

She served on the jury for the main competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

Ullmann&#x27;s fifth novel, &quot;The Cold Song&quot;, was published in Norway on 24 November 2011.

In 2015, Ullmann appeared as a featured author, leading a writing seminar, at the annual Iceland Writers Retreat in Reykjavik, Iceland.

== Personal life ==
Ullmann is married to Niels Fredrik Dahl, a novelist, playwright and poet. They live in Oslo. She has two children, including Halfdan Ullmann Tøndel, and two stepchildren.

<text>This is a list of rules of inference, logical laws that relate to mathematical formulae.

==Introduction==

Rules of inference are syntactical transform rules which one can use to infer a conclusion from a premise to create an argument. A set of rules can be used to infer any valid conclusion if it is complete, while never inferring an invalid conclusion, if it is sound. A sound and complete set of rules need not include every rule in the following list, as many of the rules are redundant, and can be proven with the other rules.

&quot;Discharge rules&quot; permit inference from a subderivation based on a temporary assumption. Below, the notation

: formula_1

indicates such a subderivation from the temporary assumption formula_2 to formula_3.

==Rules of classical predicate calculus==

In the following rules, formula_67 is exactly like formula_2 except for having the term formula_69 wherever formula_2 has the free variable formula_71.

;Universal Generalization (or Universal Introduction):
: formula_72
: formula_73

Restriction 1: formula_69 is a variable which does not occur in formula_2.

Restriction 2: formula_69 is not mentioned in any hypothesis or undischarged assumptions.

;Universal Instantiation (or Universal Elimination):
: formula_77
: formula_78

Restriction: No free occurrence of formula_71 in formula_2 falls within the scope of a quantifier quantifying a variable occurring in formula_69.

;Existential Generalization (or Existential Introduction):
: formula_82
: formula_83

Restriction: No free occurrence of formula_71 in formula_2 falls within the scope of a quantifier quantifying a variable occurring in formula_69.
;Existential Instantiation (or Existential Elimination):
: formula_83
: formula_88
: formula_3

Restriction 1: formula_69 is a variable which does not occur in formula_2.

Restriction 2: There is no occurrence, free or bound, of formula_69 in formula_3.

Restriction 3: formula_69 is not mentioned in any hypothesis or undischarged assumptions.

==Rules of substructural logic==
The following are special cases of universal generalization and existential elimination; these occur in substructural logics, such as linear logic.
;Rule of weakening (or monotonicity of entailment) (aka no-cloning theorem)

: formula_95
: formula_96

;Rule of contraction (or idempotency of entailment) (aka no-deleting theorem)

: formula_97
: formula_98

== Table: Rules of Inference ==
The rules above can be summed up in the following table. The &quot;Tautology&quot; column shows how to interpret the notation of a given rule.

All rules use the basic logic operators. A complete table of &quot;logic operators&quot; is shown by a truth table, giving definitions of all the possible (16) truth functions of 2 boolean variables (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;):

where T = true and F = false, and, the columns are the logical operators: 

* 0, false, Contradiction; 
* 1, NOR, Logical NOR (Peirce&#x27;s arrow); 
* 2, Converse nonimplication; 
* 3, ¬p, Negation; 
* 4, Material nonimplication; 
* 5, ¬q, Negation; 
* 6, XOR, Exclusive disjunction; 
* 7, NAND, Logical NAND (Sheffer stroke); 
* 8, AND, Logical conjunction; 
* 9, XNOR, If and only if, Logical biconditional; 
* 10, q, Projection function; 
* 11, if/then, Material conditional; 
* 12, p, Projection function; 
* 13, then/if, Converse implication; 
* 14, OR, Logical disjunction; 
* 15, true, Tautology.

Each logic operator can be used in an assertion about variables and operations, showing a basic rule of inference. Examples:
* The column-14 operator (OR), shows &quot;Addition rule&quot;: when &quot;p&quot;=T (the hypothesis selects the first two lines of the table), we see (at column-14) that &quot;p&quot;∨&quot;q&quot;=T.
*: We can see also that, with the same premise, another conclusions are valid: columns 12, 14 and 15 are T.
* The column-8 operator (AND), shows &quot;Simplification rule&quot;: when &quot;p&quot;∧&quot;q&quot;=T (first line of the table), we see that &quot;p&quot;=T.
*: With this premise, we also conclude that &quot;q&quot;=T, &quot;p&quot;∨&quot;q&quot;=T, etc. as shown by columns 9–15.
* The column-11 operator (IF/THEN), shows &quot;Modus ponens rule&quot;: when &quot;p&quot;→&quot;q&quot;=T and &quot;p&quot;=T only one line of the truth table (the first) satisfies these two conditions. On this line, &quot;q&quot; is also true. Therefore, whenever p → q is true and p is true, q must also be true.
Machines and well-trained people use this look at table approach to do basic inferences, and to check if other inferences (for the same premises) can be obtained.

=== Example 1 ===
Consider the following assumptions: &quot;If it rains today, then we will not go on a canoe today. If we do not go on a canoe trip today, then we will go on a canoe trip tomorrow. Therefore (Mathematical symbol for &quot;therefore&quot; is formula_99), if it rains today, we will go on a canoe trip tomorrow&quot;.
To make use of the rules of inference in the above table we let formula_100 be the proposition &quot;If it rains today&quot;, formula_101 be &quot;We will not go on a canoe today&quot; and let formula_102 be &quot;We will go on a canoe trip tomorrow&quot;. Then this argument is of the form:

formula_103

=== Example 2 ===
Consider a more complex set of assumptions: &quot;It is not sunny today and it is colder than yesterday&quot;. &quot;We will go swimming only if it is sunny&quot;, &quot;If we do not go swimming, then we will have a barbecue&quot;, and &quot;If we will have a barbecue, then we will be home by sunset&quot; lead to the conclusion &quot;We will be home by sunset.&quot;
Proof by rules of inference: Let formula_100 be the proposition &quot;It is sunny today&quot;, formula_101 the proposition &quot;It is colder than yesterday&quot;, formula_102 the proposition &quot;We will go swimming&quot;, formula_107 the proposition &quot;We will have a barbecue&quot;, and formula_108 the proposition &quot;We will be home by sunset&quot;. Then the hypotheses become formula_109 and formula_110. Using our intuition we conjecture that the conclusion might be formula_108. Using the Rules of Inference table we can prove the conjecture easily:

<doc id="354286" wikidata="Q132726" url="?curid=354286" title="Yamuna">
<text>The Yamuna (; ) is the second-largest tributary river of the Ganges by discharge and the longest tributary in India. Originating from the Yamunotri Glacier at a height of about on the southwestern slopes of Bandarpunch peaks of the Lower Himalaya in Uttarakhand, it travels and has a drainage system of , 40.2% of the entire Ganges Basin. It merges with the Ganges at Triveni Sangam, Prayagraj, which is a site of the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival held every 12 years.
Like the Ganges, the Yamuna is highly venerated in Hinduism and worshipped as the goddess Yamuna. In Hinduism, she is believed to be the daughter of the sun god, Surya, and the sister of Yama, the god of death, and so she is also known as Yami. According to popular Hindu legends, bathing in Yamuna&#x27;s sacred waters frees one from the torments of death.
The river crosses several states such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi. It also meets several tributaries along the way, including Tons, Chambal, its longest tributary which has its own large basin, followed by Sindh, the Betwa, and Ken. From Uttarakhand, the river flows into the state of Himachal Pradesh. After passing Paonta Sahib, Yamuna flows along the boundary of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and after exiting Haryana it continues to flow till it merges with the river Ganges at Sangam or Prayag in Prayagraj (Uttar Pradesh). It helps create the highly fertile alluvial Ganges-Yamuna Doab region between itself and the Ganges in the Indo-Gangetic plain.
Nearly 57 million people depend on the Yamuna&#x27;s waters, and the river accounts for more than 70 percent of Delhi&#x27;s water supply. It has an annual flow of 97 billion cubic metres, and nearly 4 billion cubic metres are consumed every year (of which irrigation constitutes 96%). At the Hathni Kund Barrage, its waters are diverted into two large canals: the Western Yamuna Canal flowing towards Haryana, and the Eastern Yamuna Canal flowing towards Uttar Pradesh. Beyond that point the Yamuna is joined by the Somb, a seasonal rivulet from Haryana, and by the highly polluted Hindon River near Noida, by Najafgarh drain near Wazirabad and by various other drains, so that it continues only as a trickling sewage-bearing drain before joining the Chambal at Pachnada in the Etawah District of Uttar Pradesh.
The water quality in Upper Yamuna, as the long stretch of Yamuna is called from its origin at Yamunotri to Okhla barrage, is of &quot;reasonably good quality&quot; until the Wazirabad barrage in Delhi. Below this, the discharge of wastewater in Delhi through 15 drains between Wazirabad barrage and Okhla barrage renders the river severely polluted. Wazirabad barrage to Okhla Barrage, stretch of Yamuna in Delhi, is less than 2% of Yamuna&#x27;s total length but accounts for nearly 80% of the total pollution in the river. Untreated wastewater and poor quality of water discharged from the wastewater treatment plants are the major reasons of Yamuna&#x27;s pollution in Delhi. To address river pollution, measures have been taken by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) under the Yamuna Action Plan (YAP) which has been implemented since 1993 by the MoEF&#x27;s National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD).

==Basin==

===Palaeochannels: Sarasvati&#x27;s tributary===

The present Sarsuti river which originates in the Shivalik hills in Himachal and Haryana border and merges with Ghaggar River near Pehowa is the palaeochannel of Yamuna. Yamuna changed its course to the east due to a shift in the slope of the Earth&#x27;s crust caused by plate tectonics.

===Sources: Banderpoonch peak and Yamunotri glacier===

The source of Yamuna lies in the Yamunotri Glacier at an elevation of , on the southwestern slopes of Banderpooch peaks, which lie in the Mussoorie range of the Lower Himalayas, north of Haridwar in Uttarkashi district, Uttarakhand. Yamunotri temple, a shrine dedicated to the goddess Yamuna, is one of the holiest shrines in Hinduism, and part of the Chota Char Dham Yatra circuit. Also standing close to the temple, on its trek route that follows the right bank of the river, lies Markendeya Tirtha, where the sage Markandeya wrote the Markandeya Purana.

===Current channel ===

The river flows southwards for about , through the Lower Himalayas and the Shivalik Hills Range. Morainic deposits are found along the steep Upper Yamuna, highlighted with geomorphic features such as interlocking spurs, steep rock benches, gorges and stream terraces. Large terraces formed over a long period of time can be seen in the lower course of the river, such as those near Naugoan. An important part of its early catchment area, totalling , lies in Himachal Pradesh. The Tons, Yamuna&#x27;s largest tributary, drains a large portion of the upper catchment area and holds more water than the main stream. It rises from the Hari-ki-dun valley and merges after Kalsi near Dehradun. The drainage system of the river stretches between Giri-Sutlej catchment in Himachal and Yamuna-Bhilangna catchment in Garhwal, also draining the ridge of Shimla. Kalanag () is the highest point of the Yamuna basin. Other tributaries in the region are the Giri, Rishi Ganga Kunta, Hanuman Ganga and Bata, which drain the upper catchment area of the Yamuna basin.

From the upper catchment area, the river descends onto the plains of Doon Valley, at Dak Pathar near Dehradun. Flowing through the Dakpathar Barrage, the water is diverted into a canal for power generation. Further downstream, the Assan River joins the Yamuna at the Asan Barrage, which hosts a bird sanctuary. After passing the Sikh pilgrimage town of Paonta Sahib, the Yamuna reaches Tajewala in Yamuna Nagar district (named after the river) of Haryana. A dam built here in 1873 is the origin of two important canals, the Western and Eastern Yamuna Canals, which irrigate the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The Western Yamuna Canal (WYC) crosses Yamuna Nagar, Karnal, Panipat and Sonipat before reaching the Haiderpur treatment plant, which contributes to Delhi&#x27;s municipal water supply. The Yamuna receives wastewater from Yamuna Nagar and Panipat cities; beyond this it is replenished by seasonal streams and groundwater accrual. During the dry season, the Yamuna remains dry in many stretches between the Tajewala dam and Delhi, where it enters near the Palla barrage after traversing .

The Yamuna defines the state borders between Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and between Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. When the Yamuna reaches the Indo-Gangetic plain, it runs almost parallel to the Ganges, the two rivers creating the Ganges-Yamuna Doab region. Spread across , one-third of the alluvial plain, the region is known for its agricultural output, particularly for the cultivation of basmati rice. The plain&#x27;s agriculture supports one-third of India&#x27;s population.


Subsequently, the Yamuna flows through the states of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh before merging with the Ganges at a sacred spot known as Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj. Pilgrims travel by boats to platforms erected in midstream to offer prayers. During the Kumbh Mela, held every 12 years, large congregations of people immerse themselves in the sacred waters of the confluence. The cities of Baghpat, Delhi, Noida, Mathura, Agra, Firozabad, Etawah, Kalpi, Hamirpur, and Prayagraj lie on its banks. At Etawah, it meets it another important tributary, Chambal, followed by a host of tributaries further down, including, Sindh, the Betwa, and Ken.

===Important tributaries===

Yamuna&#x27;s tributaries make up 70.9% of the catchment area and the river has six important tributaries:

* Tons River is Yamuna&#x27;s largest tributary and rises in the Bandarpoonch mountain. It meets Yamuna below Kalsi, near Dehradun, Uttarakhand.
* Hindon River originates from Upper Shivalik, in the Lower Himalayan Range. It is a rain fed river and has a catchment area of and traverses .
* Chambal River, also known as Charmanvati in ancient texts, flows through Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and traverses a total distance of from its source in the Vindhya Range, near Mhow. It has a drainage basin of and it supports hydro-power generation at Gandhi Sagar dam, Rana Pratap Sagar dam and Jawahar Sagar dam. The Chambal river merges with the Yamuna at Sahon village.
* Kali River, rises in the Doon Valley and merges with the Hindon River.
* Ken River, flows through Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. It originates near Ahirgawan village in Jabalpur district and travels a distance of before merging with the Yamuna at Chilla village, near Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh. It has an overall drainage basin of .
* Betwa River originates in Bhopal district, in Madhya Pradesh. Its confluence with the Yamuna is in Hamirpur district, Uttar Pradesh. It has a catchment area of .

==Background ==

===Etymology===

The name &quot;Yamuna&quot; seems to be derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;yama&quot;, meaning &#x27;twin&#x27;, and it may have been applied to the river because it runs parallel to the Ganges.

===History===
The earliest mention of Yamuna is found at many places in the Rig Veda (c. 1500–1000 BCE), which was composed during the Vedic period  BCE, and also in the later Atharvaveda, and the Brahmanas including Aitareya Brahmana and Shatapatha Brahmana. In the Rigveda, the story of the Yamuna describes her &quot;excessive love&quot; for her twin, Yama, who in turn asks her to find a suitable match for herself, which she does in Krishna.

Yamuna is mentioned as Iomanes (Ioames) in the surveys of Seleucus I Nicator, an officer of Alexander the Great and one of the Diadochi, who visited India in 305 BCE. Greek traveller and geographer Megasthenes visited India sometime before 288 BCE (the date of Chandragupta&#x27;s death) and mentioned the river in his &quot;Indica&quot;, where he described the region around it as the land of Surasena. In &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the Pandava capital of Indraprastha was situated on the banks of Yamuna, considered to be the site of modern Delhi.

Geological evidence indicates that in the distant past the Yamuna was a tributary of the Ghaggar River (identified by some as the Vedic Sarasvati River). It later changed its course eastward, becoming a tributary of the Ganges. While some have argued that this was due to a tectonic event, and may have led to the Sarasvati River drying up, the end of many Harappan civilisation settlements, and creation of the Thar desert, recent geological research suggests that the diversion of the Yamuna to the Ganges may have occurred during the Pleistocene, and thus could not be connected to the decline of the Harappan civilisation in the region.

Most of the great empires which ruled over a majority of India were based in the highly fertile Ganges–Yamuna basin, including the Magadha (), Maurya Empire (321–185 BCE), Shunga Empire (185–73 BCE), Kushan Empire (1st–3rd centuries CE), and Gupta Empire (280–550 CE), and many had their capitals here, in cities like Pataliputra or Mathura. These rivers were revered throughout these kingdoms that flourished on their banks; since the period of Chandragupta II ( 375–415 CE), statues both the Ganges and Yamuna became common throughout the Gupta Empire. Further to the South, images of the Ganges and Yamuna are found amidst shrines of the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas (753–982), and on their royal seals; prior to them, the Chola Empire also added the river into their architectural motifs. The Three River Goddess shrine, next to the Kailash rock-cut Temple at Ellora, shows the Ganges flanked by the Yamuna and Saraswati.

==Use of water ==

===1994 water sharing agreement ===

The stretch of the river from its origin at Yamunotri to Okhla barrage in Delhi is called &quot;Upper Yamuna&quot;. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed amongst the five basin states (Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi) on 12 May 1994 for sharing of its waters. This led to the formation of the Upper Yamuna River Board under India&#x27;s Ministry of Water Resources, whose primary functions are: regulation of the available flows amongst the beneficiary states and monitoring the return flows; monitoring conservation and upgrading the quality of surface and groundwater; maintaining hydro-meteorological data for the basin; overviewing plans for watershed management; and monitoring and reviewing the progress of all projects up to and including Okhla barrage.

Flood forecasting systems are established at Poanta Sahib, where Tons, Pawar and Giri tributaries meet. The river take 60 hours to travel from Tajewala to Delhi, thus allowing a two-day advance flood warning period. The Central Water Commission started flood-forecasting services in 1958 with its first forecasting station on Yamuna at Delhi Railway Bridge.

===Barrages===

Yamuna has the following six functional barrages (eight including old replaced barrages, nine including a new proposed barrage), from north-west to southeast:

* Dakpathar Barrage in Uttarakhand, managed by the Uttarakhand government.
* Hathni Kund Barrage in Haryana, from the source of Yamuna, built in 1999 and managed by Haryana government.
** Tajewala Barrage was built in 1873 and replaced by the Hathni Kund.
* Wazirabad barrage in north Delhi, from Hathni Kund barrage, managed by the Delhi government.
** &quot;New Wazirabad barrage&quot;, proposed in 2013, to be built north of the Wazirabad barrage.
* ITO barrage (Indraparstha barrage) in central Delhi, managed by the Haryana govt.
* Okhla barrage is from Wazirabad to south Delhi, managed by the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government.
** New Okhla Barrage, a new barrage, managed by the UP government.
** Palla barrage downstream on &quot;Delhi-Faridabad canal&quot; in Haryana, managed by the Haryana government.
* Gokul barrage (a.k.a. Mathura barrage) is at Gokul in Uttar Pradesh, managed by the UP government.

===Irrigation===
Use of the Yamuna&#x27;s waters for irrigation in the Indo-Gangetic Plains is enhanced by its many canals, some dating to the 14th century Tughlaq dynasty, which built the &quot;Nahr-i-Bahisht&quot; (Paradise) parallel to the river. The &quot;Nahr-i-Bahisht&quot; was restored and extended by the Mughals in the first half of the 17th century, by engineer Ali Mardan Khan, starting from Benawas where the river enters the plains and terminating near the Mughal capital of Shahjahanabad, the present city of Delhi.

====Eastern Yamuna Canal====
As the Yamuna enters the Northern Plains near Dakpathar at an elevation of , the Eastern Yamuna Canal commences at the Dakpathar Barrage and pauses at the Asan and Hathnikund Barrages before continuing south.

====Western Yamuna Canal====
The Western Yamuna Canal (WYC) was built in 1335 CE by Firuz Shah Tughlaq. Excessive silting caused it to stop flowing , when the British Raj undertook a three-year renovation in 1817 by Bengal Engineer Group. The Tajewala Barrage dam was built in 1832–33 to regulate the flow of water, and was replaced by the modern Hathni Kund Barrage in 1999.

The main canal is long. When including its branches and many major and minor irrigation channels, it has a total length of The WYC begins at the Hathni Kund Barrage about from Dakpathar and south of Doon Valley. The canals irrigate vast tracts of land in the region in Ambala, Karnal, Sonipat, Rohtak, Jind, Hisar and Bhiwani districts.

The major branch canals are:

* Agra Canal, built in 1874, which starts from the Okhla barrage beyond the Nizamuddin bridge, joining the Banganga river about below Agra. During the dry summer season, the stretch above Agra resembles a minor stream.
* Munak canal, built in 1819 and renovated in 2008, originates at Munak in Karnal district and extends 22 km to Delhi, carrying of water.
** Delhi Branch
*** Bhalaut Branch, originating at Khubru village, flows through Jhajjar district.
**** Jhajjar Branch, flows through Jhajjar district.
* Sirsa Branch, the largest branch of the WYC, constructed in 1889–1895. It originates at Indri and meanders through Jind district, Fatehabad district and Sirsa district.
** Jind Branch
*** Bhiwani Branch, which meanders through Bhiwani district and passes Bidhwan.
** Barwala Branch
* Hansi Branch, built in 1825 and remodelled in 1959. It originates at Munak and meanders through Hansi tehsil of Hisar district.
** Butana Branch
*** Sunder Branch, which passes Kanwari in Hisar district.
* Rohtak Branch

===Sutlej–Yamuna Link Canal ===
A proposed heavy freight canal, the Sutlej–Yamuna Link (SYL), is being built westwards from near Yamuna&#x27;s headwaters through the Punjab region near an ancient caravan route and highlands pass to the navigable parts of the Sutlej–Indus watershed. This will connect the Ganges, which flows to the east coast of the subcontinent, with points west (via Pakistan). When completed, the SYL will allow shipping from India&#x27;s east coast to the west coast and the Arabian Sea, shortening important commercial links for north-central India&#x27;s large population. The canal starts near Delhi, and is designed to transfer Haryana&#x27;s share of from the Indus Basin.

===National Waterway ===
Yamuna is one of the National Waterways of India, designated as NW110 in Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Some of its sections are being developed for navigation:

* Delhi–Faridabad (Wazirabad barrage to Palla barrage, via ITO barrage), is being developed for passenger and cargo ferry service.
* Delhi–Agra (Okhla barrage to Agra Canal), is planned for steamer service by the end of June 2017 with the help of the Netherlands.

== Religious significance ==
===Purifying waters ===
Like the Ganges, the Yamuna River is highly venerated in Hinduism in the form of a river and as the goddess Yamuna. The Yamuna is considered a river of heaven. The Rig Veda includes the Yamuna River as one of the seven sacred rivers, along with the Ganges. According to Hindu mythology, the River was brought to Earth by the ascetic practice of the Seven Sages where she first descended on Mount Kalinda. Therefore, Yamuna is also known as Kalindi.

The Padma Purana describes Yamuna&#x27;s purifying properties and states that her waters cleanse the mind from sin. It also mentions that bathing in her sacred waters frees one from the torments of death. Art from the Gupta period depict Yamuna and Ganga on the entrances and doorjambs of temples and sacred places. Upon passing through these doors, visitors were symbolically purified by these rivers.

Some religious figures (notably pilgrim priests of Mathura and Vrindavan) do not regard the physical pollution of the Yamuna to have any effect on the river&#x27;s spiritual purity. The Braj region is where the worship of the Yamuna and its pollution is most pronounced. However, more and more Hindus no longer ritually bathe in the Yamuna, drink its water, or use its water for worship. In Vrindavan&#x27;s holy shrines, bottled water is used instead.

=== Goddess personified ===
In her human form, Yamuna is the daughter of Surya, the sun god, and his wife Saranyu. She is the twin sister of Yama, the god of death, and is also known as Yami. The Agni Purana describes Yamuna as having a dark complexion, mounted on a turtle, and holding a pot in her hand.

=== Devotion ===
Yamuna, as a river and goddess, has a close association with Krishna. The Puranas narrate many stories about Krishna in relation to the river and its surroundings. One such story is of &quot;Kaliya Daman&quot;, the subduing of Kaliya, a &quot;Nāga&quot; which had inhabited the river and terrorised the people of Braja. Due to Krishna&#x27;s connection with the River and the Braja region, the Yamuna River is a center of pilgrimage for his devotees. In the Pushti Marga, founded by Vallabhacharya and in which Krishna is the main deity, Yamuna is worshipped as a goddess.

The &quot;Yamunashtakam&quot; is a 16th-century Sanskrit hymn composed by Vallabhacharya which describes the story of Yamuna&#x27;s descent to meet her beloved Krishna and to purify the world. The hymn also praises her for being the source of all spiritual abilities. And while the Ganges is considered an epitome of asceticism and higher knowledge and can grant &quot;Moksha&quot; or liberation, it is Yamuna, who, being a holder of infinite love and compassion, can grant freedom, even from death, the realm of her elder brother. Vallabhacharya writes that she rushes down the Kalinda Mountain, and describes her as the daughter of Kalinda, giving her the name &quot;Kalindi&quot;, the backdrop of Krishna Leela. The text also talks about her water being the colour of Lord Krishna, which is dark (Shyam). The river is referred to as Asita in some historical texts.

====Shlokas on Yamuna====

Numerous Hindu texts have shlokas (hymns) on Yamuna as follows:
* &quot;One should not give up the process of austerity. If possible, one should bathe in the water of the Yamuna. This is an item of austerity. Therefore, our Krishna consciousness movement has established a center in Vrindavana so that one may bathe in the Yamuna, chant the Hare Krishna mantra and then become perfect and return back to Godhead.&quot; (Srimad Bhagavatam 6.5.28 purport)

==Ecology==

===Fauna===

The Yamuna from the source to its culmination in Ganges is a habitat for fish for approximately stretch and supports a rich diversity of species. Fish from the family Cyprinidae dominate the variety of fish species found in the river. This includes Indian carp and also invasive species from the family. In a study, 93 species of fish were found in the river including catfish. Species of non-native Tilapia have become established in the river. They have been implicated in the decline of the Ghariyal (Indian crocodile) population in the river. Large turtles used to be a common sight on the river a few decades ago but they have mostly disappeared.

==Pollution==

In 1909, the waters of the Yamuna were distinguishable as clear blue, when compared to the silt-laden yellow of the Ganges. However, due to high-density population growth and fast industrialisation, Yamuna has become one of the most polluted rivers in the world. The Yamuna is particularly polluted downstream of New Delhi, the capital of India, which dumps about 58% of its waste into the river. A 2016 study shows that there is 100% urban metabolism of River Yamuna as it passes through the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. The most pollution comes from Wazirabad, from where Yamuna enters Delhi.

In November of 2024, a video went viral in which women were depicted bathing in foam that had emerged in the river. Although it appeared similar to that resulting from cosmetic products such as soap or shampoo, experts determined that the foam was caused by heavy pollution, and was therefore hazardous. Local authorities instructed residents not to bathe in the river for health concerns.

===Causes===

The Wazirabad barrage to the New Okhla Barrage segment, &quot;22 km stretch of Yamuna in Delhi, is less than 2% of Yamuna&#x27;s total length but accounts for nearly 80% of the total pollution in the river&quot;, 22 out of 35 sewage treatment plants in Delhi do not meet the wastewater standards prescribed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), thus untreated wastewater and poor quality of water discharged from the wastewater treatment plants are the major reasons. As of 2019, the river receives 800 million litres of largely untreated sewage and additional 44 million litres of industrial effluents each day, of which only 35 percent of the sewage released into the river are believed to be treated. In 1994, the states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi made a water sharing agreement that is due for revision in 2025. To achieve a water quality suitable for bathing (BOD&lt;3 mg/L and DO&gt;5 mg/L) would require a greater rate of water flow in the river. A study has recommended that per second of water should be released from Hathni Kund Barrage during the lean season to provide a minimum environmental flow in the Yamuna.

The last barrage across the Yamuna river is the Mathura barrage at Gokul to supply its drinking water. Downstream of this barrage, many pumping stations are constructed to feed the river water for irrigation needs. These pumping stations are near Pateora Danda , Samgara , Ainjhi , Bilas Khadar , and Samari . Depletion of the base flows available in the river during the non-monsoon months by these pump houses is exacerbating river pollution from Mathura to Prayagraj in the absence of adequate fresh water to dilute the polluted drainage from habitations and industries.

=== Cleanup efforts ===
To address river pollution, measures have been taken by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) in 12 towns of Haryana, 8 towns of Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi, under the Yamuna Action Plan (YAP) which has been implemented since 1993 by the MoEF&#x27;s National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD). The Japan Bank for International Cooperation is participating in the YAP in 15 of the towns (excluding 6 towns of Haryana included later on the direction of the Supreme Court of India) with soft loan assistance of 17.773 billion Japanese yen (equivalent to about 700 crore [7 billion rupees]) while the government of India is providing the funds for the remaining 6 towns. In 2007, the Indian government&#x27;s plans to repair sewage lines were predicted to improve the water quality of the river 90% by 2010.

Under the YAP- III scheme, a new sewage treatment plant is being built at the largest such facility in India by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). The plant is predicted to be able to treat 124 million gallons of wastewater per day, amounting to a daily removal of of organic pollutants as well as of solids.

In August 2009, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) initiated its plan for resuscitating the Yamuna&#x27;s stretch in Delhi by constructing interceptor sewers, at the cost of about 1,800 crore (18 billion rupees).

On 25 April 2014, the National Green Tribunal Act (NGA) recommended the government to declare a stretch of the Yamuna in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh as a conservation zone. A report prepared by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) panel was submitted to the NGA on the same day.

The High Court in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand ordered in March 2017 that the Ganges and its main tributary, the Yamuna, be assigned the status of legal entities, making the rivers &quot;legal and living entities having the status of a legal person with all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities&quot;. This decision meant that polluting or damaging the rivers is equivalent to harming a person. The court cited the example of the New Zealand Whanganui River, which was also declared to possess full rights of a legal person.

<text>The Eurasian three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) is a medium-sized woodpecker that is found from northern Europe across northern Asia to Japan.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian three-toed woodpecker was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He coined the binomial name &quot;Picus tridactylus&quot;. The type locality is Sweden. The specific epithet is from the Ancient Greek &quot;tridaktulos&quot; meaning &quot;three-toed&quot; (&quot;tri-&quot; is &quot;three-&quot; and &quot;daktulos&quot; is toe). The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Picoides&quot; that was introduced by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. The Eurasian three-toed woodpecker was formerly considered conspecific with the American three-toed woodpecker (&quot;Picoides dorsalis&quot;).

Eight subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. t. tridactylus&quot; – northern Europe to the southern Ural Mountains and to south-eastern Siberia and north-eastern China
* &quot;P. t. alpinus&quot; – central and south-eastern Europe to western Ukraine and Romania
* &quot;P. t. crissoleucus&quot; – northern Ural Mountains to eastern Siberia
* &quot;P. t. albidior&quot; – eastern Siberia and Kamchatka Peninsula
* &quot;P. t. tianschanicus&quot; – eastern Kazakhstan and western China
* &quot;P. t. kurodai&quot; – north-eastern China and North Korea
* &quot;P. t. inouyei&quot; – Japan (Hokkaido)
* &quot;P. t. funebris&quot; – central China

The subspecies &quot;P. t. funebris&quot; is sometimes treated as a separate species, the dark-bodied woodpecker.

==Description==

The Eurasian three-toed woodpecker is in length, just a little smaller than the great spotted woodpecker. The adult has black and white plumage except for the yellow crown of the male. Neither sex has any red feathers. It has black wings and rump, and white from the throat to the belly; the flanks are white with black bars. The back is white with black bars, and the tail is black with the white outer feathers barred with black. Juveniles of both sexes have a yellow crown.

The voice call of the Eurasian three-toed woodpecker is a &quot;kik&quot; or &quot;chik&quot;

The breeding habitat is coniferous forests across the Palearctic from Norway to Korea. There are also populations in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.

Three-toed woodpeckers nest in a cavity in a dead conifer or sometimes a live tree or pole. The pair excavates a new nest each year.

This bird is normally a permanent resident, but northern birds may move south and birds at high elevations may move to lower levels in winter.

Three-toed woodpeckers forage on conifers in search of wood-boring beetle larvae or other insects. They may also eat fruit and tree sap.

These birds often move into areas with large numbers of insect-infested trees, often following a forest fire or flooding.

== Status ==
A survey conducted by BirdLife International in 2015 estimated the European population of the species at 1,200,000–2,900,000 adults. As the European population is estimated to be around 20% of the global population, the latter is roughly estimated at 6,000,000–14,500,000 adults worldwide.

Although some decline was observed in the European population between 1970 and 2000, the overall population is considered to be fairly stable; and due to the species&#x27; wide range and large population, it is classified by the IUCN at a conservation status of &quot;Least Concern&quot;.

<doc id="354293" wikidata="Q1361191" url="?curid=354293" title="Harry Atkinson">
<text>Sir Harry Albert Atkinson (1 November 1831 – 28 June 1892) served as the tenth premier of New Zealand on four separate occasions in the late 19th century, and was Colonial Treasurer for a total of ten years. He was responsible for guiding the country during a time of economic depression, and was known as a cautious and prudent manager of government finances, though distrusted for some policies such as his 1882 National Insurance (welfare) scheme and leasehold land schemes. He also participated in the formation of voluntary military units to fight in the New Zealand Wars, and was noted for his strong belief in the need for seizure of Māori land.

==Early life==
Atkinson, born in 1831 in the English village of Broxton, Cheshire, received his education in England, but chose at the age of 22 to follow his elder brother William to New Zealand. He was accompanied by his brother Arthur together with members of the Richmond family. On arriving in New Zealand, Harry and Arthur bought farmland in Taranaki, as did the Richmonds, and also the Ronalds family – five brothers and sisters of Dr Edmund Ronalds. James and William Richmond also later entered politics and the Ronalds sisters married Atkinson&#x27;s brothers. Atkinson&#x27;s correspondence shows that he was highly satisfied with his decision to move to New Zealand, seeing it as an opportunity to prosper. He named his small farmhouse Hurworth after a village in England where he had lived as a boy, although—as his father worked as an itinerant builder and architect—the family did not settle anywhere.

==Military service==
Atkinson was made a sergeant of the Taranaki Volunteer Rifle Company in February 1859 and then commissioned as a captain in March. He led No. 2 Company throughout the First Taranaki War and saw action at the Battles of Waireka, Mahoetahi and Kaitake. He was promoted to major in February 1864.

==Provincial politics==
Atkinson first became involved in politics, as a member of the Taranaki provincial council. He represented the Grey and Bell electorate from 1857 to 1865, and again from 1873 to 1874. He was a member of the Executive Council from 1868 and again in 1874 (May to October). He was Deputy Superintendent in 1861–1862 to Charles Brown, and again in 1863.

Of particular interest to him was policy regarding Māori-owned land, which he wished to see taken over by the British settlers. Continued Māori ownership, he believed, prevented economic development for the colony. Atkinson and his Richmond relations regarded the Māori as &quot;savages&quot;, and believed in war as a reasonable option for ensuring Māori co-operation with British land-acquisition.

==Member of Parliament==





The death of William Cutfield King in February 1861 caused a by-election in the Grey and Bell electorate. Atkinson was elected to Parliament unopposed. In 1864, he was made Defence Minister in the government of Frederick Weld. He was highly active in this portfolio, advocating a policy of &quot;self-reliance&quot; in the conduct of the war. In 1866, however, he retired due to the death of his wife Amelia (whom he had married in 1856). The following year, he married his cousin Annie. He returned to parliament from 1867 to 1869 for the Town of New Plymouth electorate, but in April 1869 he resigned to concentrate on maintaining his farm.

In 1872, Atkinson returned to politics for the Egmont electorate; to defeat William Sefton Moorhouse, who was allied with William Fox, a prominent supporter of Māori land rights. Atkinson declared that he would &quot;not see a &quot;Foxite&quot; get in&quot;, and narrowly defeated Moorhouse. Once in parliament, Atkinson soon became involved in economic matters, opposing the policies of Julius Vogel (who also happened to be a supporter of Māori land rights). Vogel, who supported extensive borrowing to finance public works, was attacked by Atkinson as reckless. Vogel&#x27;s response was that Atkinson was overly cautious, and would delay economic progress.

Atkinson and Vogel both agreed, however, that borrowing by provincial government (as opposed to the central government) was indeed out of control. The two also believed that provincial politicians were petty and self-interested, and that more co-operation was needed between provinces and the state. It was this shared view of provincial government that enabled Vogel and Atkinson to co-operate, although they never resolved their differences on borrowing by the central government or on dealings with the Māori. Atkinson eventually became part of Vogel&#x27;s cabinet, but not with portfolios related to negotiations with Māori or to finance. He did continue to express his opinions on these matters, but found it increasingly harder to convince people of his views.

==Premier of New Zealand==
===First term===

In 1876, Vogel retired, and Atkinson managed to secure the Premiership. One of his first acts was to abolish the provinces. He also took over direct responsibility for financial policy, and implemented a less aggressive strategy for borrowing. He attempted to reform the system by which money was handled, placing all responsibility for borrowing with the government while increasing control of spending at a district or municipal level. However, growing economic problems caused his plan to encounter difficulties. As the economy declined, Atkinson became more and more unpopular.

===Second and third terms===
Atkinson lost power in 1877, only slightly over a year after he gained it. He entered opposition, continuing to promote his ideas of financial caution. He also proposed a number of other measures, including national insurance. In 1883, he managed to make a comeback, gaining the Premiership for eleven months before losing it to Robert Stout. The two then engaged in a protracted struggle for the leadership. A strong counter-offensive by Atkinson enabled him to unseat Stout again after only twelve days. Stout, however, was not so easily defeated, and took the Premiership again after seven days. This time, Stout held his position for three years, defeating Atkinson&#x27;s attempts to oust him.

===Fourth term===
There was confusion in Wellington in September 1887 when the members gathered to form a government. John Bryce, Robert Stout and William Rolleston had all lost their seats. Sir John Hall said he was too old. Sir Julius Vogel&#x27;s policies had been rejected by the voters. So there was no alternative to Harry Atkinson, and after two weeks of negotiations he announced a ministry on 11 October. Only two ministers had served with him before. The &quot;Scarecrow Ministry&quot; was not expected to last, but did. The years 1887 and 1888 were the worst of the Long Depression, and Atkinson cut salaries, raised loans and raised customs duties. He was not popular with the wealthy, but they feared the Opposition leaders Grey and Ballance even more.

During this term, Atkinson was Colonial Treasurer (1887–1891), Postmaster-General (1887–1889), Commissioner of Telegraphs (1887–1889), Minister of Marine (1887–1891), Commissioner of Stamps (1887–1891), Minister of Education (1889), and Commissioner of Trade and Customs. In January 1888, Atkinson was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. A Freemason, he was installed as the Wellington district grand master in May 1888.

By 1890 Atkinson was too ill to make speeches in the House.

===Defeat===

In 1891, Atkinson was finally superseded as Premier by John Ballance of the newly created Liberal Party, the country&#x27;s first organised political party. Atkinson acceded to the wishes of his friends, and on 23 January 1891 he was appointed to the Legislative Council, along with six other men, to attempt to block any radical bills that Ballance might introduce in the Lower House. Ballance became Premier on 24 January, and appointed Atkinson as Speaker of the Legislative Council.

The Liberals, who represented the ideas of William Fox, Julius Vogel, and many other of Atkinson&#x27;s opponents, were to hold power for 21 years after Atkinson&#x27;s defeat, but Atkinson was not to see this. After presiding over the first meeting of the Council on 28 June in the 1892 session, Atkinson returned to the Speaker&#x27;s Room, where he died. He was buried in Karori Cemetery.

<doc id="354295" wikidata="Q485557" url="?curid=354295" title="Rani Mukerji">
<text>Rani Mukerji (pronounced ; born 21 March 1978) is an Indian actress who works in Hindi films. Noted for her versatility, she is the recipient of multiple accolades, including eight Filmfare Awards. Mukerji has featured in listings of the leading and highest-paid actresses of the 2000s.

Born into the Mukherjee-Samarth family, Mukerji dabbled with acting as a teenager by starring in her father Ram Mukherjee&#x27;s Bengali-language film &quot;Biyer Phool&quot; and in the social drama &quot;Raja Ki Aayegi Baaraat&quot; (both 1996). Mukerji had her first commercial success with the action film &quot;Ghulam&quot; and breakthrough with the romance &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (both 1998). Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by Yash Raj Films as the star of the drama &quot;Saathiya&quot;.

Mukerji established herself by starring in several commercially successful romantic films, including &quot;Chalte Chalte&quot; (2003), &quot;Hum Tum&quot;, &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; (both 2004), and &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; (2006), and the crime comedy &quot;Bunty Aur Babli&quot; (2005). She also gained praise for playing an abused wife in the political drama &quot;Yuva&quot; (2004) and a deaf and blind woman in the drama &quot;Black&quot; (2005). Mukerji&#x27;s collaborations with Yash Raj Films from 2007 and 2010 produced several unsuccessful films and led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. This changed when she played a headstrong journalist in the biographical thriller &quot;No One Killed Jessica&quot; (2011). Further success came with the thrillers &quot;&quot; (2012), &quot;Mardaani&quot; (2014) and &quot;Mardaani 2&quot; (2019), the comedy-drama &quot;Hichki&quot; (2018), which emerged as Mukerji&#x27;s highest-grossing release, and the drama &quot;Mrs. Chatterjee vs Norway&quot; (2023).

Mukerji is involved with humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show &quot;Dance Premier League&quot;. Mukerji is married to filmmaker Aditya Chopra, with whom she has a daughter.

== Early life and background ==
Mukerji was born in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) on 21 March 1978 into the Mukherjee-Samarth family. Her father, Ram Mukherjee, was a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios. Her mother, Krishna Mukherjee, is a former playback singer. Her elder brother, Raja Mukherjee, is a film producer and director. Her maternal aunt, Debashree Roy, is a Bengali film actress and her paternal second cousin, Kajol, is a Hindi film actress and her contemporary. Another paternal second cousin, Ayan Mukerji, is a scriptwriter and film director. Despite her parents and most of her relatives being members of the Indian film industry, Mukerji was uninterested in pursuing a career in film. She said, &quot;There were already too many actresses at home and I wanted to be someone different&quot;.

Mukerji received her education at Maneckji Cooper High School in Juhu and graduated with a degree in Home Science from SNDT Women&#x27;s University. She is a trained Odissi dancer and began learning the dance form while in the tenth grade. As part of an annual tradition, the Mukherjee family celebrates the festival of Durga Puja in the suburban neighbourhood of Santacruz every year. Mukerji, a practising Hindu, takes part in the festivities with her entire family.

In 1994, director Salim Khan approached Mukerji to play the lead female role in his directorial, &quot;Aa Gale Lag Jaa&quot;. Her father disapproved of a full-time career in film at such a young age, so she rejected the offer. At age 18, following her mother&#x27;s suggestion that she pursue acting on an experimental basis, Mukerji accepted leading roles in the social drama &quot;Raja Ki Aayegi Baaraat&quot;, Khan&#x27;s second offer to her, and her father&#x27;s Bengali film &quot;Biyer Phool&quot;, both of which were released on the same day in October 1996. Before she began work on &quot;Raja Ki Aayegi Baaraat&quot;, Mukerji trained at Roshan Taneja&#x27;s acting institute. She portrayed a rape victim who is forced to marry her rapist in the film. Although the film was a commercial failure, Mukerji&#x27;s performance earned her a special recognition trophy at the annual Screen Awards ceremony. Following the film&#x27;s poor showing at the box office, Mukerji returned to college to complete her education. However, inspired by her cousin Kajol&#x27;s success in Hindi films, she decided to pursue a full-time career in films.

== Career ==
=== Breakthrough and initial struggle (1998–2001) ===
In 1998, Mukerji starred opposite Aamir Khan in Vikram Bhatt&#x27;s action film &quot;Ghulam&quot;, her first commercial success. Though her role in the film was brief, the song &quot;Aati Kya Khandala&quot; earned her public recognition. Due to Mukerji&#x27;s husky voice, Bhatt had someone with a higher pitched voice dub her lines; Mukerji stated that it was done as her voice &quot;did not suit the character&quot;. In the same year, Karan Johar cast her opposite Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in his directorial debut &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;. The role was originally written for Twinkle Khanna, but when she and several other leading ladies rejected it, Johar signed Mukerji on the insistence of Khan and the filmmaker Aditya Chopra. She played Khan&#x27;s character&#x27;s love interest and later wife, Tina who dies after giving birth to their daughter. Johar had originally intended to dub Mukerji&#x27;s voice, but she improved her diction and eventually provided her own voice. Reviewing the film for &quot;India Today&quot;, Nandita Chowdhury wrote that it was &quot;the gorgeous Rani who steals the show. Oozing oomph from every pore, she also proves herself an actress whose time has come&quot;. &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; proved a breakthrough for Mukerji; it had earnings of over to emerge as the year&#x27;s top-grossing Hindi film, and won eight Filmfare Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Mukerji. Following this, she had starring roles in &quot;Mehndi&quot; (1998) and &quot;Hello Brother&quot; (1999), critical and commercial disappointments that failed to propel her career forward.

By 2000, Mukerji wanted to avoid typecasting as a &quot;standard Hindi film heroine&quot; and thus decided to portray more challenging roles in addition to the archetypical glamorous lead. In &quot;Badal&quot; and &quot;Bichhoo&quot;, two male-centric action dramas (both starring Bobby Deol), she played roles that were met with little acclaim from critics. A supporting role in Kamal Haasan&#x27;s bilingual film &quot;Hey Ram&quot; proved more rewarding. The film was a partly fictionalised account of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s assassination and Mukerji played a Bengali school teacher who is raped and murdered during communal riots in Calcutta. Having only portrayed glamorous roles thus far, she was challenged by Haasan&#x27;s insistence on realism and to appear on screen without wearing make-up; she believed that the experience changed her approach to acting. The controversial subject matter of &quot;Hey Ram&quot; led to poor box office earnings, but the film was critically acclaimed and selected as India&#x27;s official entry to the Oscars. After starring in the romantic comedies &quot;Hadh Kar Di Aapne&quot; and &quot;Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye&quot;, Mukerji starred alongside Salman Khan and Preity Zinta in the romantic comedy &quot;Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega&quot;, which earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare. Padmaraj Nair of &quot;Screen&quot; found her role to be &quot;too meagre for her to prove herself&quot; but added that &quot;she is quite adequate in whatever scenes she has been given&quot;.

Mukerji&#x27;s first film of 2001, &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot;, was released after controversy over the film&#x27;s funding by the Mumbai underworld delayed it by a few months. The film, based on surrogacy, marked her second collaboration with Salman Khan and Zinta. Film critic Sukanya Verma found Mukerji to be &quot;handicapped with a role that doesn&#x27;t give her much scope&quot; and preferred the &quot;meatier&quot; role of Zinta. In &quot;Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai&quot; and &quot;&quot;, films that failed to gain a wide audience theatrically, Mukerji played the love interests of Abhishek Bachchan and Anil Kapoor respectively. In a review for the latter film, Sarita Tanwar of Rediff.com bemoaned that she had &quot;very little to do except being part of some magnificently picturised songs&quot;. An article in &quot;Mint&quot; summarised that a majority of her roles post &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; were &quot;inconsequential&quot;.

=== Established actress (2002–2006) ===
Mukerji began collaborating with Yash Raj Films in 2002, when the company cast her in two productions: &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot;, a romantic comedy co-starring Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor, and &quot;Saathiya&quot;, a remake of the Tamil romance &quot;Alaipayuthey&quot;. The former performed poorly at the box office, as did her two collaborations with Govinda that year&quot;Pyaar Diwana Hota Hai&quot; and &quot;Chalo Ishq Ladaaye&quot;. The romantic drama &quot;Saathiya&quot;, however, proved a turning point in her career. At the 48th Filmfare Awards, she received her first Best Actress nomination and was awarded the Critics Award for Best Actress (shared with Manisha Koirala in &quot;Company&quot;). Shaad Ali cast her in the role of Suhani Sharma, a medical student who deals with the troubles of being married at a young age, for the vulnerability that he found in her. She refused the offer at first as she disliked the idea of remaking an accomplished film but was convinced to accept the part by the film&#x27;s producer Aditya Chopra. In it, she played opposite Vivek Oberoi, with whom she did not enjoy working, saying that his &quot;attitude was bothersome&quot;. &quot;Saathiya&quot; emerged as a commercial success. The BBC wrote that &quot;Mukerji plays the character of a middle-class girl with great conviction&quot;, and Udita Jhunjhunwala of &quot;Mid-Day&quot; added that &quot;her expressions and acting are understated in a role that fits her like a glove&quot;.

The year 2003 marked the beginning of the most successful period in Mukerji&#x27;s career. She replaced Aishwarya Rai to play the lead opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Aziz Mirza&#x27;s romance &quot;Chalte Chalte&quot;. Media reports suggested that Rai was replaced after feuding with her then boyfriend Salman Khan on the film&#x27;s sets, but Shah Rukh Khan insisted that Mukerji had been the original choice for the role. Mukerji believed that the theme of &quot;Chalte Chalte&quot;, which dealt with misunderstandings between a married couple, was similar to that of &quot;Saathiya&quot;, and she tried to lend variety to the role by putting &quot;them against a different background&quot;. She has said that working with Shah Rukh Khan was a learning experience for her, and he would often scold her if she performed inadequately. A commercial success, &quot;Box Office India&quot; credited it as a career comeback for Mukerji, and she was rewarded with a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. None of her other releases of the year—&quot;Chori Chori&quot;, &quot;Calcutta Mail&quot;, and &quot;&quot;—made a mark.

At the 50th Filmfare Awards, Mukerji won both the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress awards, becoming the only actress to win both awards in the same year. The Best Supporting Actress win was for Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Yuva&quot; (2004), a composite film with an ensemble cast, about three youngsters from different strata of society whose lives intersect by a car accident; Mukerji was cast as Shashi Biswas, a poor Bengali housewife who is abused by her husband, a local goon (Abhishek Bachchan). She based her role on her house helps who were abused by their husbands, and observed their body language and speaking style. Taran Adarsh wrote, &quot;Amongst the leading ladies, it is Rani Mukerji who is the best of the lot. The role demanded an actress of substance and Rani more than lives up to the expectations.&quot; She won the Best Actress award for her starring role as Rhea Prakash in Kunal Kohli&#x27;s &quot;Hum Tum&quot; (2004), a romantic comedy about two headstrong individuals who meet at different stages of their lives. The film pitted her opposite Saif Ali Khan and proved one of the biggest commercial successes of the year. &quot;The Hindu&quot; found Mukerji&#x27;s portrayal of Rhea 
to be &quot;self assuredly competent&quot; and Tanmaya Kumar Nanda of Rediff.com wrote, &quot;Rani is her usual collected self, changing into the many hues of her character with the ease of a chameleon&quot;.

This success continued when Yash Chopra cast her in his period romantic drama &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; (2004). Set against the background of India–Pakistan relations, it is about the titular star-crossed lovers (Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta). In a part originally written for a man, Mukerji played a Pakistani lawyer who tries to help the couple. With a worldwide gross of , &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; emerged as the highest-grossing Hindi film of the year, and it was later screened at the Berlin International Film Festival. Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; took note of the &quot;quietly dignified perf from Mukerji&quot;, and the BBC opined that she &quot;deserves praise for her acting. To act through your eyes and not using dialogue is an art. Rani for one, has perfected this.&quot; She won the IIFA Award for Best Supporting Actress, and received a nomination in the same category at Filmfare.

In 2005, &quot;Outlook&quot; magazine published that Mukerji had established herself as the most successful actress of contemporary Hindi cinema. Her first film role that year was opposite Amitabh Bachchan in Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#x27;s &quot;Black&quot;, a drama about an alcoholic man who dedicates his life to teach a blind and deaf girl how to communicate. Bhansali wrote the part of the blind-deaf girl specifically for Mukerji, who was initially hesitant to take on the role due to its &quot;challenging&quot; subject matter. Once Bhansali enforced his faith in her, she agreed and began studying sign language with professionals at the Helen Keller Institute in Mumbai. &quot;Black&quot; won several awards including two National Film Awards and 11 Filmfare Awards, and Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; featured it as the fifth best film of the year. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine called Mukerji&#x27;s performance &quot;astonishing&quot;, and &quot;Filmfare&quot; included her work in their listing of Indian cinema&#x27;s &quot;80 Most Iconic performances&quot; and wrote, &quot;Rani has left an indelible mark with this role that usually comes once in a lifetime for most&quot;. She became the only actress to win both the Best Actress and Best Actress – Critics trophies at the Filmfare Awards ceremony.

Mukerji received another Best Actress nomination that year at Filmfare for her work opposite Abhishek Bachchan in &quot;Bunty Aur Babli&quot;, which marked her fifth collaboration with Yash Raj Films. She played the title character of Babli, a con woman. The film was the second highest-grossing Hindi film of 2005. Namrata Joshi of &quot;Outlook&quot; wrote that she &quot;plays to the gallery with ease&quot;. Mukerji followed it with Amol Palekar&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;Paheli&quot;, reuniting her with Shah Rukh Khan. The film was a box office flop in India but was given a strong international release; it was screened at the Sundance Film Festival and was India&#x27;s submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards. Raja Sen of Rediff.com was impressed by the film as well as Mukerji&#x27;s performance which he called &quot;another perfectly played part&quot;. Mukerji&#x27;s final release of the year was the period film &quot;Mangal Pandey: The Rising&quot;, about the titular soldier. Director Ketan Mehta initially approached her for a cameo appearance, which was developed into a larger part during filming. Her role was that of Heera, a prostitute who becomes the love interest of Pandey (Aamir Khan). Derek Elley mentioned that despite a small role, Mukerji made &quot;the most of her feisty nautch-girl&quot;.

Mukerji turned down an offer from Mira Nair to star in the English film &quot;The Namesake&quot;, choosing instead to reteam with Karan Johar in &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; (2006), a drama about infidelity. Collaborating once again with Shah Rukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan and Zinta, she played an unhappily married woman who has an affair with a married man. Commenting on the divisive nature of her role, Mukerji said that it changed her own perception of love and marriage. &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; was a popular release, earning over to emerge as the highest-grossing Hindi film in overseas to that point. Rajeev Masand wrote that the &quot;consistently competent Rani Mukherjee takes on the film&#x27;s toughest role a part that may be hard to sympathise with but she injects it with tenderness and believability&quot;, but Kaveree Bamzai of &quot;India Today&quot; dismissed it as another one of her roles requiring the &quot;art of weeping copiously and smiling valiantly&quot;. It won Mukerji a third consecutive IIFA Award for Best Actress and a sixth Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. The poorly received melodrama &quot;Baabul&quot; was her final film appearance of that year.

=== Professional setback (2007–2009) ===
Following the failure of &quot;Baabul&quot;, Yash Raj Films cast Mukerji in Siddharth Anand&#x27;s family drama &quot;Ta Ra Rum Pum&quot; in the role of a racing driver&#x27;s (Saif Ali Khan) wife and the mother of two. She was excited to play the part of a mother for the first time, and modelled her character after her own mother. Released in 2007, the film was a financial success, but received mixed reactions from critics. Khalid Mohamed hailed Mukerji&#x27;s performance as &quot;near flawless&quot; but Rajeev Masand thought that neither she nor Khan &quot;are able to make much of an impression because their characters are so unidimensional and boring.&quot; The drama &quot;Laaga Chunari Mein Daag&quot; from director Pradeep Sarkar starred Mukerji as a young woman who is forced to moonlight as a prostitute to fend for her family. Her portrayal earned her a seventh Best Actress nomination at Filmfare, but the film had poor critical and financial returns. Shubhra Gupta of &quot;The Indian Express&quot; noted that Mukerji was responsible for &quot;hold[ing] the film together, even if her part, both as the ingénue and the hooker, doesn&#x27;t have freshness&quot;.

Mukerji once again played a prostitute in Bhansali&#x27;s &quot;Saawariya&quot;, an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;White Nights&quot;, co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor. She insisted that the consecutive prostitutes she played were different from each other, with the one in &quot;Saawariya&quot; having &quot;no problem with her profession&quot;. Her only release in three years not produced by Yash Raj Films, it was the first Indian film produced by a Hollywood studio, Sony Pictures. The film was a box office flop and met with poor reactions from critics. Mukerji&#x27;s performance, which was described by A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;divine&quot;, earned her a second Filmfare nomination that year, this time for Best Supporting Actress. By the end of 2007, Mukerji&#x27;s popularity had begun to wane. &quot;Rediff.com&quot; attributed this to her &quot;monotonous pairing&quot; with the same set of actors; &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; published that she had become an &quot;exclusive Yash Raj heroine&quot; which hindered other filmmakers from approaching her.

After a series of dramatic parts, Mukerji sought to play a light-hearted part, which she found in Kunal Kohli&#x27;s &quot;Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic&quot; (2008), a children&#x27;s film about an angel who comes to Earth to help four troubled kids. In a scathing review, Khalid Mohamed criticised Mukerji&#x27;s choice of roles and wrote that &quot;she&#x27;s one-dimensional, either darting full blast smiles or tetchy scowls. Her costumes, too, are uneasy-on-the-eyes&quot;. The film had low box office returns and further contributed to a decline in Mukerji&#x27;s career prospects. An &quot;India Today&quot; article spoke of her &quot;running out of luck at the box office&quot; and mentioned her decline in endorsements.

In an attempt to overcome this decline, Mukerji lost weight and underwent a makeover. She continued to collaborate with Yash Raj Films, taking on a starring role opposite Shahid Kapoor in the romantic comedy &quot;Dil Bole Hadippa!&quot; (2009). Mukerji had high expectations from the film in which she played a cricket-obsessed Punjabi village girl masquerading as a man, and it had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. &quot;The Economic Times&quot; critic Gaurav Malani was disappointed with the picture and wrote that Mukerji &quot;comes up with a spirited performance but her mock sob-whine-whimper do not amuse anymore. Also after a point you dislike visualizing the charming actress as the moustached male player&quot;. The film was Mukerji&#x27;s fourth financial failure in a row. When questioned about her recent spate of flops with the Yash Raj Films banner, she defended the collaborations, saying that &quot;I stand by those films regardless of their fate&quot;. Later that year, she featured as a talent judge for the Sony Entertainment Television reality show &quot;Dance Premier League&quot;. She agreed to appear on television to gain visibility during a low phase in her film career.

=== Success in thrillers and &quot;Hichki&quot; (2010–2019) ===

Aniruddha Guha of &quot;Daily News and Analysis&quot; described Mukerji&#x27;s performance in the 2011 film &quot;No One Killed Jessica&quot; as &quot;one of her best performances till date&quot;. Co-starring Vidya Balan, the film was Mukerji&#x27;s first commercial success since &quot;Ta Ra Rum Pum&quot;, and was especially noted for being so in the absence of a male star. Based on the Jessica Lal murder case, it featured Mukerji as a fictionalised foul-mouthed journalist who is deeply involved with the case. She has described how different the role was from the ones she had previously played, saying, &quot;I actually had to play a man!&quot; Certain critics, however, were critical of her performance, including Anupama Chopra, who called her role &quot;the fatal, false note&quot;, arguing that &quot;the character is written superficially and Rani&#x27;s portrayal of her is equally banal. It&#x27;s all about externals. She argues a lot and proudly labels herself a bitch but her hair stays perfectly in place and in the end, she even gets to do a super-hero-like slow motion walk.&quot; Even so, the role earned her a third Best Supporting Actress trophy at Filmfare.

Mukerji next accepted a leading role in the comedy of manners &quot;Aiyyaa&quot; (2012). Under the direction of Sachin Kundalkar, she played a woman with a heightened sense of smell who develops a one-sided attraction towards Prithviraj Sukumaran&#x27;s character. Critically and commercially unsuccessful, &quot;Rediff.com&quot; criticised her decision to star in the film, writing that she &quot;gets no support from the way her character is written&quot;. Greater success came for her portrayal of Roshni Shekhawat, a mother grieving the death of her child, in Reema Kagti&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;&quot;. Co-starring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor, the film had worldwide earnings of over to emerge as the year&#x27;s eighth highest-grossing Hindi film. Ronnie Schieb of &quot;Variety&quot; described Mukerji as &quot;vivid in a quietly sympathetic role&quot;, and she received a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare.

In 2013, Mukerji starred in the anthology film &quot;Bombay Talkies&quot; consisting of four short films. She was part of the segment helmed by Johar, in which she played a journalist who discovers that her husband (Randeep Hooda) is gay. The film was screened at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Despite poor box office returns, &quot;Bombay Talkies&quot; met with critical acclaim, particularly for Johar&#x27;s segment; Tushar Joshi of &quot;Daily News and Analysis&quot; praised the subtlety in Mukerji&#x27;s performance. The following year, Mukerji starred in Pradeep Sarkar&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Mardaani&quot;, in which she played the lead role of Shivani Shivaji Roy, a Marathi policewoman involved in a kidnapping case that leads her to uncover secrets of human trafficking. She took on the role to show girls &quot;how they need to protect themselves&quot;. In preparation, she interacted with senior officials of Mumbai Police, and learned the Israeli self-defence technique of Krav Maga. Rajeev Masand credited Mukerji for &quot;investing Shivani with both physical strength and emotional courage, she gives us a hero that&#x27;s hard not to root for&quot;, and Anupama Chopra commended her for providing her character with both &quot;steely resolve&quot; and &quot;emotional depth&quot;. The film was a commercial success and garnered Mukerji another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.

Following the birth of her child, Mukerji took a four-year hiatus to focus on her daughter and was persuaded by her husband, Aditya Chopra, to return to acting. She was keen to work on a project that would accommodate her parental commitments and found it in the comedy-drama &quot;Hichki&quot; (2018). Inspired by Brad Cohen&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Front of the Class&quot;, the film tells the story of Naina Mathur, an aspiring teacher suffering from Tourette syndrome who must prove herself by educating underprivileged children. Mukerji interacted with Cohen and she trained to make her character&#x27;s motor and vocal tics appear spontaneous and not rehearsed. In a mixed review, Anna M. M. Vetticad of &quot;Firstpost&quot; wrote that she &quot;lifts &quot;Hichki&quot; every time she is on the scene, bringing empathy and charm to Naina&#x27;s character without at any moment soliciting the audience&#x27;s pity.&quot; It earned worldwide, a majority of which came from the Chinese box office, and its success led Mukerji to express an interest in working more frequently in the future. She gained another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.

Mukerji reprised her role as Shivani Shivaji Roy in &quot;Mardaani 2&quot; (2019), directed by Gopi Puthran, who wrote the first film. In it, Roy faces off against a young rapist (Vishal Jethwa). &quot;The Indian Express&quot; wrote that Mukerji is &quot;in command right through as she works to a script which pushes her to the fore at every given chance&quot;, but Rahul Desai of &quot;Film Companion&quot; criticised her for overplaying Roy &quot;as more of a &quot;Dhoom&quot; franchise character&quot; than a cop. &quot;Mardaani 2&quot; performed well at the box office and gained her another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. The commercial success of three consecutive films led &quot;Filmfare&quot; to credit Mukerji for breaking &quot;the stereotype that actresses have battled for generations that post marriage and kids, an actress&#x27; career gets over in Bollywood&quot;.

=== Intermittent work (2020–present) ===
In 2021, Mukerji reprised her part as Babli from &quot;Bunty Aur Babli&quot; in the successor &quot;Bunty Aur Babli 2&quot;. A commercial and critical failure, the film was panned for its technical aspects but Mukerji&#x27;s performance and comic timing were better received by reviewers for &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; and &quot;The Times of India&quot;. Mukerji next starred in &quot;Mrs. Chatterjee vs Norway&quot; (2023), a drama about a real-life Bengali woman whose children were taken away by the Norwegian Child Welfare Services. It marked her first project in a decade to not be produced by Yash Raj Films. She based her character&#x27;s diction and mannerisms on her own mother. Reviewing the film for &quot;Screen Daily&quot;, Namrata Joshi dismissed its melodramatic tone, adding that &quot;most disappointing is an otherwise reliable Mukherji being far from effective in her shrill and showy turn&quot;. Made on a shoestring budget, it emerged as a sleeper hit. She won a third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress for her performance (shared with Shefali Shah for &quot;Three of Us&quot;) and a record-tying fourth IIFA Award for Best Actress.

Mukerji will next star in an as-yet untitled family drama from filmmaker Shonali Bose, and will reprise her role in the action sequel &quot;Mardaani 3&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Mukerji prefers not to publicise her personal life. She limits her interactions with the media and is sometimes labelled a recluse; she said in a 2011 interview, &quot;Today actors have become more open with the media. But this has posed a problem for actors like me because if I don&#x27;t do that, then I end up being called reclusive. So now I have changed myself and am easily approachable.&quot; Mukerji has collaborated frequently and maintained a close friendship with actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, and filmmaker Karan Johar. She does not have any social media accounts, as she prefers to keep a low profile.

The nature of Mukerji&#x27;s relationship with filmmaker Aditya Chopra was the topic of fervent tabloid reporting in India, though she refused to publicly talk about it. On 21 April 2014, she married Chopra at a private Bengali ceremony in Italy. The following year, she gave birth to their daughter Adira. She has said that &quot;the time spent being a mother is the happiest period of my life&quot;. Mukerji has said that she believes in maintaining a work-life balance after motherhood, adding that &quot;it is extremely important for [a mother] to have a career and use her time constructively&quot;. In 2023, she revealed that she had a miscarriage in 2020, five months into her second pregnancy.

== Off-screen work ==

=== Stage shows and other appearances ===
Mukerji has participated in several concert tours and televised award ceremonies. Her first concert tour, &quot;Magnificent Five&quot;, was in 1999 in which she performed with actors Aamir Khan, Aishwarya Rai, Akshaye Khanna and Twinkle Khanna. The &quot;Temptations 2004&quot; concert had Mukerji perform alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Preity Zinta, Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra in 19 stage shows worldwide. The following year, she participated in the &quot;Temptations 2005&quot; concert in New Delhi with Shah Rukh Khan, Fardeen Khan, Ameesha Patel and Malaika Arora Khan; the show was organised to help raise funds for the National Centre For Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP).

In 2010, Mukerji performed at a concert in the Army Stadium of Dhaka, Bangladesh with several Bollywood actors including Shah Rukh Khan, Rampal and Ishaa Koppikar. For the &quot;Temptations Reloaded&quot; concert of 2012 in Jakarta, Mukerji performed alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Zinta and Bipasha Basu, for the 2013 concert of the same name in Auckland, she performed with Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit and Jacqueline Fernandez, and in 2014 she performed in Malaysia with Shah Rukh Khan, Dixit, Yo Yo Honey Singh and Arijit Singh.

Mukerji was all set to make her appearance at Cannes Film Festival, 2011 with Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Karan Johar, but later opted out due to her father&#x27;s ill health. She has also been part of documentaries including &quot;Bollywood im Alpenrausch&quot;, &quot;Gambling, Gods and LSD&quot; and &quot;The Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan&quot;. In addition, Mukerji has often turned muse for various designers including Sabyasachi at the Lakme Fashion Week. She walked ramp for Salman Khan&#x27;s &quot;Being Human&quot;″s fantastic 40s era fashion during &quot;The Couture for a Cause - The Being Human Show&quot; in 2010.

=== Humanitarian work ===
Alongside her acting career, Mukerji is involved with humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. Mukerji was appointed as an ambassador by Procter &amp; Gamble and the NGO Child Rights and You for their joint venture, Shiksha, to endorse the cause of children&#x27;s education. In 2011 she set up a Stroke Treatment Fund, in association with the Indian Stroke Association, to pay for the treatment of financially deprived stroke-affected patients. She has made public appearances to support other charities and causes. In March 2004, she visited the Indian army unit in Pokhran, Rajasthan to interact with the jawan troops, for the NDTV reality show &quot;Jai Jawan&quot;. A decade later, in August 2014, she visited the jawans again at Baramulla. In February 2005, Mukerji and several other Bollywood actors participated in the 2005 HELP! Telethon Concert to raise money for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.

In March 2006, Mukerji celebrated her birthday with the physically challenged children of the Helen Keller Institute; she had previously worked with them while preparing for her role in &quot;Black&quot;. In November 2010, she was part of a fund raising auction for the &quot;Because I am a Girl&quot; charity campaign. In 2014, Mukerji attended a charity dinner on child trafficking hosted by the British Asian Trust in London, where she was felicitated by Prince Charles for raising awareness on the issue through her work in &quot;Mardaani&quot;.

Mukerji also attended &quot;Junoon&quot; charity cricket match, hosted by the Rotaract Club of HR College Mumbai in 2012. She appeared as celebrity guest on &quot;Kaun Banega Crorepati&quot;″s Hindi and Bengali version, after which she donated the received prize money for social causes. She donated Hindi versions prize money to the Bandra Holy Family Hospital, for their NICU centre and donated Bengali versions money for other charity works. In 2012, PETA India acknowledged Mukerji with a Hero to Animals Award for her compassionate work for animals.

== Artistry and screen persona ==
Mukerji is considered in the media as one of the most popular and accomplished actresses of Indian cinema. As part of a career analysis, Sukanya Verma noted that after making an unconventional debut in films, Mukerji oscillated between success and failure for a few years before achieving &quot;the status of a star, performer and showgirl&quot;. Indo-Asian News Service reported that during her initial years in the industry, Mukerji was written off as the successful Kajol&#x27;s poor cousin for being &quot;plump&quot; and &quot;short&quot;. Raja Sen opined that despite that, Mukerji &quot;slogged her way with grit&quot; to emerge a successful star.

Mukerji&#x27;s directors Pradeep Sarkar and Reema Kagti have taken note of how much Mukerji prepares for her roles, with Kagti adding, &quot;She gets obsessive about the role and wants to know everything about her character. What&#x27;s her character&#x27;s back-story, what is going on in her head at a specific point&quot;. Mukerji described her approach to acting in 2012:

A month before I start shooting, I sit with my director, try to understand how he has visualised the character on the screen and take notes. Then I start working on the most basic thing – the look. It&#x27;s very important that the physical appearance of the character gets decided because if I look the character, it makes it all the more believable. Once that is achieved, I go into the finer nuances of what the girl is like, her background. And then from there [...] I have to get the accent right. 

Mukerji actively avoids typecasting, and has been credited in the media for her versatility. Manjula Negi of &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; said that she balances between high-profile blockbusters and small-scale films. Namrata Joshi of &quot;Outlook&quot; adds that she is unafraid to take risks and portray roles that &quot;none of her contemporaries have been able to do&quot;. Mukerji has played several roles that were considered to be a departure from traditional portrayals of women in mainstream Indian cinema at that time; in &quot;Hum Tum&quot; she played a widow who engages in pre-marital sex, in &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; she is involved in an extra-marital affair with a married man, and in &quot;Bichhoo&quot; and &quot;No One Killed Jessica&quot; she smokes, drinks and mouths expletives. The media cites her as an &quot;unconventional beauty&quot; – her husky voice, eyes and smile being her distinctive features. Baradwaj Rangan believes that Mukerji&#x27;s unusual &quot;sandpaper-scratchy, I&#x27;m-recovering-from-a-bad-cold&quot; voice sets her apart from her contemporaries. &quot;Filmfare&quot; termed Mukerji &quot;Earthy, effervescent and emotional&quot;. It added that her screen presence has &quot;no parallel&quot;.

Writing about her acting skills, &quot;Forbes India&quot; noted, &quot;Regarded as one of the best actors of her generation, Mukerji went on to master her skills to such an extent that she could easily absorb the nuances of the characters she played and effortlessly become that person on screen.&quot; Shraddha Jahagirdar-Saxena cited Mukerji as the &quot;ruling star&quot; of the silver firmament and added, &quot;Mukerji has achieved a certain standing in the industry. She is the embodiment of the modern, independent woman who has made it on her own steam and on her own terms.&quot; When Mukerji made her screen comeback with &quot;Hichki&quot;, Nayandeep Rakshit compared her to actress Sridevi and said that making a strong comeback, Mukerji has managed to still be &quot;relevant&quot;. Gautam Chintamani called the actress &quot;effortlessly talented&quot; and noted, &quot;Mukerji mirrors the epitaph of being one of the last true superstars in the conventional description of the word.&quot;
Mukerji became the first and the only Indian actress to win both the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress Filmfare trophies in a single year. She later achieved another feat, when she won both the Best Actress - Critics and Best Actress awards during the same year for the same film, the first ever actress to do so.

In &quot;Rediff.com&quot;″s annual listing of &quot;Best Bollywood Actresses&quot;, she topped the list for three consecutive years (2004–2006).

Mukerji is also known as a sex symbol and is among the most attractive actresses. The UK magazine &quot;Eastern Eye&quot; placed her in their &quot;Asia&#x27;s Sexiest Women&quot; list between 2006 and 2012. &quot;The Times of India&quot; placed her 2nd in their &quot;50 Beautiful Faces&quot; list.

Adding further to Mukerji&#x27;s star power, &quot;Femina&quot; listed her in their &quot;50 Most Beautiful Women&quot; list in 2007 and 2008. American hip hop Blue Scholars, named a song after Mukerji in their 2011 album Cinemetropolis. Mukerji has been the brand ambassador for a number of products, but since 2007, Mukerji&#x27;s popularity was on a decline and she lost out on her brand endorsements to a number of younger actresses.

Mukerji featured among the &quot;Greatest Bollywood Stars&quot; in a UK poll celebrating 100 years of Indian cinema in 2013. That same year, Mukerji was honoured by the US Council on the day of Barack Obama&#x27;s inauguration into office for Contribution to Indian Cinema. She has received the Rajiv Gandhi Award for her contribution to the entertainment industry. In 2015, the University of Mumbai felicitated her for her contribution to Bollywood. In 2017, she was honoured with the Outstanding Contribution to Cinema Award by the Government of Mauritius, and in 2018, was received an award for Excellence in Cinema at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. Mukerji was among the ten recipients of IIFA-FICCI Frames&#x27; award for Most Powerful Entertainers of the Decade.

== Accolades ==

Mukerji has won eight Filmfare Awards. For her roles in the films &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998), &quot;Yuva&quot; (2004) and &quot;No One Killed Jessica&quot; (2011), she won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.

<doc id="354296" wikidata="Q6501052" url="?curid=354296" title="Vestment">
<text>Vestments are liturgical garments and articles associated primarily with the Christian religion, especially by Eastern Churches, Catholics (of all rites), Lutherans, and Anglicans. Many other groups also make use of liturgical garments; among the Reformed (Calvinist) Churches this was a point of controversy in the Protestant Reformation and sometimes since, in particular during the ritualist controversies in the Church of England in the 19th century.

==Origins of vestments==

In the early Christian churches, officers and leaders, like their congregations, wore the normal dress of civil life in the Greco-Roman world, although with an expectation that the clothing should be clean and pure during holy observances. From the 4th century onward, however, modifications began to be made to the form of the garments, and, as secular fashions changed from the 6th century, the church retained the original forms of their garments, although with separate development and with regional variations. Having separate, consecrated clothing for the ceremonies and rites in the churches emphasized the sacred nature of the functions the priest and ministers carried out at the altar. The Catholic Church&#x27;s vestments had essentially established their final forms by the 13th century.

The Reformation brought about a new approach towards simplicity, especially under the influence of Calvinism. The Church of England experienced its own controversies over the proper use of vestments. On the other hand, Lutheranism largely retained many pre-Reformation vestments, especially in Scandinavia, e.g. Church of Sweden. The resulting varieties of liturgical dress are described below.

==Rubrics for vesting==
The rubrics (regulations) for the type of vestments to be worn vary between the various communions and denominations. In some, clergy are directed to wear special clerical clothing in public at all, most, or some times. This generally consists of a clerical collar, clergy shirt, and (on certain occasions) a cassock. In the case of members of religious orders, non-liturgical wear includes a religious habit. This ordinary wear does not constitute liturgical vestment, but simply acts as a means of identifying the wearer as a member of the clergy or a religious order.

A distinction is often made between the type of vestment worn for Holy Eucharist or Holy Communion and that worn for other services. Non-Eucharistic vestments are typically referred to as &quot;choir dress&quot; or &quot;choir habit&quot; in the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican churches, because they are worn for the chanting of the Daily Office, which, in the West, takes place in the choir rather than the sanctuary. In other traditions, there is no specific name for this attire, although it often takes the form of a Geneva gown worn with or without preaching bands and a stole or preaching scarf.

In the more ancient traditions, each vestment—or at least the stole—will have a cross on it, which the clergy kiss before putting it on. A number of churches also have special vesting prayers which are recited before putting each vestment on, especially the Eucharistic vestments.

==Western Christian vestments==

For the Eucharist, each vestment symbolizes a spiritual dimension of the priesthood, with roots in the very origins of the Church. In some measure these vestments harken to the Roman roots of the Western Church.

Use of the following vestments varies. Some are used by all Western Christians in liturgical traditions. Many are used only in the Latin Church Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican churches, and there is much variation within each of those churches.

;Cassock: An item of clerical clothing; a long, close-fitting, ankle-length robe worn by clerics of the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran and some Reformed churches.

; Stole: The long, narrow strip of cloth draped around the neck, a vestment of distinction, a symbol of ordination. Deacons wear it draped across the left shoulder diagonally across the body to the right hip while priests and bishops wear it draped around the back of the neck. It may be crossed in the front and secured with the cincture. Traditionally, this was done by priests when wearing Eucharistic vestments, whereas bishops always wore it uncrossed (as possessing the fullness of the priesthood). In modern usage, it is common for both bishops and priests to wear the stole uncrossed. Corresponds to the Orthodox &quot;orarion&quot; and &quot;epitrachelion&quot; (see below).
; Alb: The common garment of any ministers at the eucharist, worn over a cassock. Most closely corresponds to the Orthodox &quot;sticharion&quot; (see below). Symbolizes baptismal garment. See also cassock-alb.
;Cassock-alb or cassalb: A relatively modern garment, a combination of the traditional cassock and alb. It developed as a convenient undergarment (or alternative to a cassock at the Eucharist) worn by clergy and as an alternative to the alb for deacons and acolytes.

:A white or off-white cassock-alb has replaced the traditional cassock and alb in some Anglican and Lutheran churches since the 1970s.

; Pectoral cross: A large cross worn on a chain or necklace around the neck by clergy of many Christian denominations. In some traditions it is associated with bishops. In the Roman Catholic tradition it is only worn by bishops, abbots, and certain canons who are granted the use of the pectoral cross by special indult. In choir dress the cross is gold with a green rope, red for cardinals. In house dress, it is silver with a silver chain.

===Used by Catholics, Anglicans and Lutherans===
; Surplice: A white tunic worn over a cassock or habit. It is commonly worn by altar servers, and choir members. In Catholic and high church Anglicanism, it may be worn by clergy who are attending a Eucharist but not by the celebrant. Among lower church Anglicans and some Lutherans and Methodists, the Surplice is sometimes worn with a stole or scarf (and less often by itself) as the proper vestment for the Eucharist.
; Cope: A circular cape reaching to the ankle, commonly used by bishops and priests and, sometimes, also by deacons. In traditions that historically reject the use of the Chasuble, the Cope may be used as a Eucharistic vestment.
; Rochet: Similar to a surplice but with narrower sleeves. In Catholic and Anglo-Catholic use, it is often highly decorated with lace. The Anglican version is bound at the cuffs with a band of cloth and worn with a chimere. Its use is reserved to bishops and certain canons.
; Zucchetto: A skull cap, similar to the Jewish kippah. Commonly worn by bishops (including cardinals and the Pope) and less commonly by other clergy.
; Mitre: Worn by bishops and some abbots. Despite having the same name, this does not really correspond with the Eastern mitre (see below), which has a distinct history and which was adopted much later.

===Used by Catholics and some Anglicans and Lutherans===
; Maniple: A liturgical handkerchief bound about the wrist, it is only used during the Mass. The maniple fell out of common use with the 1970 post-conciliar liturgical reform, but is gaining in popularity in many circles and is used today in the context of the Tridentine Mass, in which it is required by rubrics, and in some Anglo-Catholic and other parishes. According to some authorities, this corresponds to the Orthodox &quot;epigonation&quot; (see below).
; Humeral veil: Long cloth rectangle draped around the shoulders and used to cover the hands of the priest when carrying the monstrance. It is also worn by the subdeacon when holding the paten.
; Biretta: A rectangular cap that may be worn by clergy of all ranks except the Pope; its color can signify rank.
; Tunicle: The outermost garment of subdeacons.
; Chasuble: The outermost sacramental garment of priests and bishops, often quite decorated. It is only worn for the celebration of the Eucharist. Corresponds to the Orthodox &quot;phelonion&quot; (see below). See also chasuble-alb.
; Dalmatic: The outermost garment of deacons. Corresponds to the Orthodox &quot;sticharion&quot; (for deacons) and &quot;sakkos&quot; (for bishops).
; Amice: a cloth around the neck used to cover the collar of street attire. It is worn by the celebrant, deacon, and subdeacon for the Mass.
; Cincture: It is a long woven cord used to cinch the alb at the waist, and to contain the stole as it hangs down the body. Corresponds to the Orthodox &quot;zone&quot;.

===Used only by Catholics===
; Pallium: A narrow band of lamb&#x27;s wool decorated with six black crosses, worn about the neck with short pendants front and back, worn by the Pope and bestowed by him to Metropolitan bishops and Archbishops. Corresponds to the Orthodox &quot;omophorion&quot; (see below).
; Rationale: An episcopal humeral worn over the chasuble. It is only used by the Bishops of Eichstätt, Paderborn, Toul, and Cracow (Kraków). Until the 17th century, it was also in use in the Bishopric of Regensburg (Ratisbon).
; Pontifical gloves: The liturgical gloves worn by a bishop celebrating a Pontifical Solemn Mass. They are usually seen today only within the context of the Tridentine Mass.
; Pontifical sandals: The liturgical sandals worn by a bishop celebrating a Pontifical Solemn Mass. They are usually covered by the liturgical stockings, which are of the liturgical color of the Mass. They are usually seen today only within the context of the Tridentine Mass.
; Fanon: A double-layered mozzetta, now only occasionally worn by the Pope during solemn Pontifical High Masses.
; Papal tiara: Formerly worn by the Pope at his coronation and at other key moments; it has fallen out of use but may be revived at any time if the reigning Pontiff wishes. Apart from the coronation, this was only worn on special occasions such as during Ex Cathedra announcements, some solemn processions and the blessing &quot;Urbi et Orbi&quot;.
; Subcinctorium: A vestment similar to a broad maniple but worn suspended from the right side of the cincture, decorated with a cross on one end and an agnus dei on the other; worn only by the Pope during a Pontifical High Mass.
; Falda: A vestment that forms a long skirt extending from under the hem of the alb; worn only by the Pope during a Pontifical High Mass and draped over the Pope&#x27;s body at a Papal Funeral.

===Used only by Anglicans===
; Chimere: Red or black outer garment of bishops. Resembles a knee-length open-front waistcoat.
; Gaiters: Covering of the lower leg worn by archdeacons and bishops. Black, buttoned up the sides and worn to just below the knee. Largely obsolete.
; Canterbury cap: A soft square-shaped hat.

===Used variously by Lutherans, Anglicans, Reformed, Methodists and Baptists===
;Bands: A type of neckwear, in the form of two oblong pieces of white cloth, which is tied about the neck so as to hang from the collar. Sometimes referred to as &quot;preaching bands&quot;, they are worn traditionally by most of the Anglican, Lutheran and Methodist clergy with a cassock (with or without a surplice) or gown.
;Tippet (or preaching scarf): A black scarf worn by bishops, priests and deacons in Anglican churches. It is worn in the same fashion as a stole, but does not have the same significance. Dissenting ministers also historically wore these and, though now rare, they are re-emerging in some Presbyterian and Baptist circles. A blue tippet is also used in Anglican churches by readers, who are members of the laity who have been given special license from the bishop to lead non-sacramental services in the absence of an ordained person. The blue colour differentiates readers from clergy.
; Academic Gown: Also known as the &quot;Geneva Gown&quot;, this is a simple vestment with open, wide and bell-shaped sleeves. The gown is traditionally worn open (or vented) over a cassock, with preaching bands and an academic hood. Historically, Anglican clergy would remove their surplice and put on a black gown for the preaching, though this practice is rare today. Also, along with preaching bands, it formed the typical daily dress of Anglican clergy from the Reformation until the early 19th century. English Dissenting churches (Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Baptists) preferred to wear the gown alone with the cassock and bands at all times, most being wary of the surplice (a remnant of the &quot;Surplice War&quot; which followed the reforms enacted by Archbishop William Laud, referred to as &quot;Laudianism&quot;).
; Academic Hood: Hoods, which denote the highest academic degree of their wearers, are usually worn by Anglican clergy at choir offices. They are also sometimes worn by Methodists and Reformed/Presbyterian clergy with an academic gown (&quot;Geneva Gown&quot;), though this is fairly rare in the United States.

===Paleo-Orthodoxy and Emerging Church movements===
Among the Paleo-Orthodoxy and Emerging Church movements in Protestant and evangelical churches, which includes many Methodists and Presbyterians, clergy are moving away from the traditional black Geneva gown and reclaiming not only the more ancient Eucharist vestments of alb and chasuble, but also cassock and surplice (typically a full length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite).

==Eastern Church vestments==
===Byzantine Rite===


In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Eastern Catholic churches, any member of the clergy of whatever rank is vested when serving his particular function during the Divine Liturgy or other service. As in the Latin Church, the use of vestments is rooted in the early history of the church. The various vestments serve several different functions. The three forms of stole (&quot;Orarion&quot;, &quot;Epitrachelion&quot;, and &quot;Omophorion&quot;) are marks of rank. The three outer garments (&quot;Sticharion&quot;, &quot;Phelonion&quot;, and &quot;Sakkos&quot;) serve to distinguish the clergy from the laity. Some are practical (&quot;Zone&quot; and &quot;Epimanikia&quot;), holding the other vestments in place. Some (&quot;Nabedrennik&quot; and &quot;Epigonation&quot;) are awards of distinction.

Obligatory vestments for presbyters are: Sticharion, Epitrachelion, Epimanikia, Zone, and Phelonion. Awards are: Nabedrennik, Kalimavkion, Pectoral cross, Epigonation, Pectoral cross with decorations, Mitre, second Pectoral cross with decorations, and Patriarchal Pectoral cross.

Obligatory vestments for deacons are: Sticharion, Epimanikia, and Orarion. Awards are: double orarion, and Kalimavkion.

Awards for bishops are: second panagia, and patriarchal panagia.

In addition to these functions, most vestments carry a symbolic meaning as well. These symbolic meanings are often indicated by the prayer that the priest says as he puts each item on. These prayers are verses taken directly from the Old Testament, usually the Psalms. For example, the prayer for the Sticharion is from Isaiah 61:10:
:&quot;My soul will rejoice in the Lord, for he has clothed me with a garment of salvation and wrapped me in a robe of gladness; he has placed a crown on my head as on a bridegroom, and adorned me with beauty as a bride.

; Sticharion (Greek ): Actually a form of the garment given at baptism and worn by the newly baptized, this is the one vestment worn by all clergy. It is also used by non-ordained persons carrying out a liturgical function, such as altar servers. For priests and bishops, it is made of lightweight material, usually white. It corresponds most closely with the Western &quot;alb&quot; (see above).
; Orarion (Greek ): A long narrow strip of cloth worn by deacons over the left shoulder and reaching to the ankle in both front and back. It is also worn by subdeacons and, in some places of the Greek tradition, by tonsured altar servers. It corresponds to the Western &quot;stole&quot; (see above).
; Epitrachelion (Greek , &quot;over the neck&quot;): This stole is worn by priests and bishops as the symbol of their priesthood. It is worn around the neck with the two adjacent sides sewn or buttoned together, leaving enough space through which to place the head. It corresponds to the Western &quot;stole&quot; (see above).
; Epimanikia (Greek ): Cuffs bound with laces. The deacon wears them beneath the sticharion, priests and bishops above.
; Zone (Greek ζώνη): Cloth belt worn by priests and bishops over the epitrachelion. Corresponds to the Western &quot;cincture&quot; (see above).
; Phelonion (Greek ): Large conical sleeveless garment worn by priests over all other vestments, with the front largely cut away to free the hands. Byzantine rite Bishops may also wear the phelonion when not serving according to hierarchical rubrics. Corresponds to the Western &quot;chasuble&quot; (see above).
; Sakkos (Greek σάκκος): Instead of the phelonion, the bishop usually wears the sakkos or Imperial dalmatic. This is a tunic reaching below the knees with wide sleeves and a distinctive pattern of trim. It is always buttoned up the sides.
; Nabedrennik (Slavonic набедренникъ): A square or rectangular cloth suspended on the right side by two adjacent corners from a strap drawn over the left shoulder. This is a relatively recent Russian invention and is not used in the Greek tradition. It is an award, so it is not worn by all priests. Bishops do not wear it.
; Epigonation/Palitsa (Greek &quot;over the knee&quot;; Slavonic палица, &quot;club&quot;): A stiff diamond-shaped cloth that hangs on the right side of the body; it is suspended by one corner from a strap drawn over the left shoulder. It is worn by all bishops and as an award for priests.
; Omophorion (Greek ): This is the distinctive episcopal vestment, a wide cloth band draped about the shoulders in a characteristic manner. It corresponds to the Western &quot;pallium&quot; (see above).
; Mitre (Greek ): Modeled on the ancient Byzantine imperial crown, it is worn by all bishops and in some Slavic traditions also awarded to some high-ranking priests. The bishop&#x27;s mitre is surmounted by a cross, but the priest&#x27;s is not; both are bulbous and adorned with icons. Coptic Orthodox &amp; Ethiopian Orthodox bishops also wear the Byzantine mitre. Armenian Orthodox, on the other hand, have the Byzantine mitre as part of the normal vestments worn by priests of all ranks, and their bishops are distinguished by wearing mitres after the western shape. Mitres are not worn in the Syriac Orthodox tradition, where a decorated hood like an amice called &quot;masnaphto&quot;, meaning &#x27;turban&#x27;, is worn instead by prelates.
; Pectoral cross: A large cross is worn around the neck by all bishops, but not necessarily by all priests. In Russian usage, the style of Pectoral cross worn indicates the rank of the priest.
; Engolpion/Panagia: &quot;Engolpion&quot; (Greek ) is a general term for something worn upon the bosom; here, it refers to a medallion with an icon in the center. A &quot;Panagia&quot; (Greek Παναγία, &quot;All-holy&quot;, one of the titles of the Theotokos) is an engolpion with Mary as the subject of the icon; this is worn by all bishops. All primates and some bishops below primatial rank have the dignity of a second engolpion, which usually depicts Christ.
; Mantle (Greek ): This is a sleeveless cape that fastens at the neck and the feet, worn by all monks. The usual monastic mantle is black; that worn by the bishop as he enters the church for a service but before he is vested is more elaborately colored and decorated. This is, strictly speaking, an item of street wear, not a vestment; however, in modern usage it is worn only in church.

====Eastern Orthodox examples====

=====Liturgical=====
=====Non-liturgical=====
===Syro-Malabar Catholic Church (India)===
The Syro Malabar Catholic Church follows the East Syriac rite and the vestments used in Holy Mass are based on East Syriac tradition.

* koththina
* urara
* zande
* zunara
* soshappa
* kappa (kappa)

===Oriental Orthodox Churches===
Within the Oriental Orthodox Churches and the corresponding Eastern Catholic Churches there is much variance as to what vestments are used.

====Coptic, Ethiopian, and Eritrean Churches====
In these Churches, generally only a white robe will be used for the Eucharistic service. On more solemn occasions, an epitrachelion-like vestment is worn, and sometimes a vestment resembling a cope is worn. Priests and bishops always carry a Hand Cross during services. Deacons wear either an orarion crossed over the left shoulder, or brought around the back (where the two pieces form a cross) and then hanging down in front (not crossed), secured by the cross piece.

====Syrian/Indian Churches====

In these Churches, a more full set of vestments is used. Apart from the usual Sticharion (called &quot;Kutino&quot; in Syriac), Epitrachelion (called &quot;Hamnikho&quot;), Zone (called &quot;Zenoro&quot;), and Epimanikia (called &quot;Zende&quot;), a priest will wear a Cope-like vestment called a &quot;Phanyo&quot;. Prelates will in addition wear a hood-like head-covering called a &quot;Masnaphto&quot; over the &quot;Kutino&quot; and under the &quot;Phanyo&quot;. Prelates will also wear a &quot;Batrashil&quot; or Pallium (similar to an Epitrachelion but reaching down in both front and back) as well as Pectoral Icons. In addition, they will have a vestment similar to the &quot;Epigonation&quot; worn attached the &quot;Zenoro&quot; on the right side (called a &quot;Sakro&quot;) and will carry a crosier and hand cross. Deacons wear the &quot;Kutino&quot; and an Orarion (called an &quot;Uroro&quot;) in different ways depending on their order:

*Chanters wear only the &quot;Kutino&quot;
*Readers wear the &quot;Uroro&quot; crossed like a Greek subdeacon
*Subdeacons wear the &quot;Uroro&quot; crossed over the left shoulder
*Deacons wear the &quot;Uroro&quot; like a Greek deacon
*Archdeacons wear the &quot;Uroro&quot; with both ends hanging down in front, secured by a &quot;Zenoro&quot;, and they also wear &quot;Zende&quot; 

====Armenian Apostolic Church====
; Varkas: This is a broad stiff band of heavily-embroidered brocade and decoration, functioning like a collar, worn exclusively by Armenian Rite priests over the phelonion. It corresponds to, and is likely derived from, the Western &quot;amice&quot;.

<text>A craniate is a member of the Craniata (sometimes called the Craniota), a proposed clade of chordate animals with a skull of hard bone or cartilage. Living representatives are the Myxini (hagfishes), Hyperoartia (including lampreys), and the much more numerous Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates). Formerly distinct from vertebrates by excluding hagfish, molecular and anatomical research in the 21st century has led to the reinclusion of hagfish as vertebrates, making living craniates synonymous with living vertebrates.

The clade was conceived largely on the basis of the Hyperoartia (lampreys and kin) being more closely related to the Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates) than the Myxini (hagfishes). This, combined with an apparent lack of vertebral elements within the Myxini, suggested that the Myxini were descended from a more ancient lineage than the vertebrates, and that the skull developed before the vertebral column. The clade was thus composed of the Myxini and the vertebrates, and any extinct chordates with skulls.

However recent studies using molecular phylogenetics have contradicted this view, with evidence that the Cyclostomata (Hyperoartia and Myxini) is monophyletic; this suggests that the Myxini are degenerate vertebrates, and therefore the vertebrates and craniates are cladistically equivalent, at least for the living representatives. The placement of the Myxini within the vertebrates has been further strengthened by recent anatomical analysis, with vestiges of a vertebral column being discovered in the Myxini.

==Characteristics==
In the simplest sense, craniates are chordates with well-defined heads, thus excluding members of the chordate subphyla Tunicata (tunicates) and Cephalochordata (lancelets), but including Myxini, which have cartilaginous crania and tooth-like structures composed of keratin. Craniata also includes all lampreys and armoured jawless fishes, armoured jawed fish, sharks, skates, and rays, and teleostomians: spiny sharks, bony fish, lissamphibians, temnospondyls and protoreptiles, sauropsids and mammals. The craniate head consists of a three-part brain, neural crest which gives rise to many cell lineages, and a cranium.

In addition to distinct crania (sing. &quot;cranium&quot;), craniates possess many derived characteristics, which have allowed for more complexity to follow. Molecular-genetic analysis of craniates reveals that, compared to less complex animals, they developed duplicate sets of many gene families that are involved in cell signaling, transcription, and morphogenesis (see homeobox).

In general, craniates are much more active than tunicates and lancelets and, as a result, have greater metabolic demands, as well as several anatomical adaptations. Aquatic craniates have gill slits, which are connected to muscles to pump water through the slits, engaging in both feeding and gas exchange (as opposed to lancelets, whose pharyngeal slits are used only for suspension feeding, chiefly by cilia-mucus rather than muscles). Muscles line the alimentary canal, moving food through the canal, allowing higher craniates such as mammals to develop more complex digestive systems for optimal food processing. Craniates have cardiovascular systems that include a heart with at least two chambers, red blood cells, oxygen transporting hemoglobin as well as myoglobin, livers and kidneys.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
Linnaeus (1758) classified hagfishes as Vermes, a class for non-arthropod invertebrates (in modern nomenclature).

Dumeril (1806) grouped hagfishes and lampreys in the taxon Cyclostomi, characterized by horny teeth borne on a tongue-like apparatus, a large notochord as adults, and pouch-shaped gills (Marspibranchii). Cyclostomes were regarded as either degenerate cartilaginous fishes or primitive vertebrates. Cope (1889) coined the name Agnatha (&quot;jawless&quot;) for a group that included the cyclostomes and a number of fossil groups in which jaws could not be observed. Vertebrates were subsequently divided into two major sister-groups: the Agnatha and the Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates). Stensiö (1927) suggested that the two groups of living agnathans (i.e. the cyclostomes) arose independently from different groups of fossil agnathans.

Løvtrup (1977) argued that lampreys are more closely related to gnathostomes based on a number of uniquely derived characters, including:

*Arcualia (serially arranged paired cartilages above the notochord)
*Extrinsic eyeball muscles
*Radial muscles in the fins
*A closely set atrium and ventricle of the heart
*Nervous regulation of the heart by the vagus nerve
*A typhlosole (a spirally coiled valve of the intestinal wall)
*True lymphocytes
*A differentiated anterior lobe of the pituitary gland (adenohypophysis)
*Three inner ear maculae (patches of acceleration sensitive &#x27;hair cells&#x27; used in balance) organized into two or three vertical semicircular canals 
*Neuromast organs (composed of vibration sensitive hair cells) in the laterosensory canals
*An electroreceptive lateral line (with voltage sensitive hair cells)
*Electrosensory lateral line nerves
*A cerebellum, i.e. the multi-layered roof of the hindbrain with unique structure (characteristic neural architecture including direct inputs from the lateral line and large output Purkinje cells) and function (integrating sensory perception and coordinating motor control)

In other words, the cyclostome characteristics (e.g. horny teeth on a &quot;tongue&quot;, gill pouches) are either instances of convergent evolution for feeding and gill ventilation in animals with an eel-like body shape, or represent primitive craniate characteristics subsequently lost or modified in gnathostomes. On this basis Janvier (1978) proposed to use the names &quot;Vertebrata&quot; and &quot;Craniata&quot; as two distinct and nested taxa.

==Validity==
The validity of the taxon &quot;Craniata&quot; was recently examined by Delarbre et al. (2002) using mtDNA sequence data, concluding that Myxini is more closely related to Hyperoartia than to Gnathostomata - i.e., that modern jawless fishes form a clade called Cyclostomata. The argument is that, if Cyclostomata is indeed monophyletic, Vertebrata would return to its old content (Gnathostomata + Cyclostomata) and the name Craniata, being superfluous, would become a junior synonym.

The new evidence removes support for the hypothesis for the evolutionary sequence by which (from among tunicate-like chordates) first the hard cranium arose as it is exhibited by the hagfishes, then the backbone as exhibited by the lampreys, and then finally the hinged jaw that is now ubiquitous. In 2010, Philippe Janvier stated:
==Classification==
Below is a phylogenetic tree of the phylum Chordata. Lines show probable evolutionary relationships, including extinct taxa, which are denoted with a dagger, †. Some groups in this tree (lancelets and tunicates) are invertebrates. The positions (relationships) of the lancelet, tunicate, and craniate clades are as reported. Note that Placodermi is now thought to be paraphyletic.

<text>Husum is a locality situated in Örnsköldsvik Municipality, Västernorrland County, Sweden with 1,647 inhabitants in 2010.

It is located close to the northern entrance to the High Coast. It has an active sports club in Husums IF (ice hockey, soccer, wrestling, ski jumping, cross-country skiing, orienteering, etc.), and a very active entrepreneurial spirit with many small local businesses, including a famous bakery. The &quot;Husum Big Band&quot;, a wind instrument orchestra that dates back to the early 1900s, is still active - playing in concerts both locally and regionally. The &quot;Grundsunda Framtidsgrupp&quot; is an association formed in 1995 to promote the interests of the local inhabitants.

The Husum Paper mill and Sulphate pulp mill is the main employer in the area, and has been a significant influence on the municipality since it was founded in 1919 by Mo och Domsjö AB (&quot;Modo&quot; for short, see also Modo Hockey). Metsä Board of Finland (previously known as M-Real and Metsä-Serla) acquired the mill in 2000.

Situated close to both the sea and the mountains, Husum has two rivers (Husån and Gideälven) flowing into the municipality. It was a perfect location for a sawmill, bringing timber to the mill by floating them downstream. This sawmill was the origin of the current paper and pulp mill. Husum is very close to the regional airport at Gideå, and a station for the new rail line Botniabanan has just been built close to the center of municipality.

<doc id="354307" wikidata="Q7268516" url="?curid=354307" title="Quainton Road railway station">
<text>Quainton Road railway station was opened in 1868 in under-developed countryside near Quainton, in the English county of Buckinghamshire, from London. Built by the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, it was the result of pressure from the 3rd Duke of Buckingham to route the railway near his home at Wotton House and to open a railway station at the nearest point to it. Serving a relatively underpopulated area, Quainton Road was a crude railway station, described as &quot;extremely primitive&quot;.

It became a junction station in 1871 with the opening of the line to Brill. In 1899, it became a main line station with the opening of the Great Central Railway London extension. 

In 1933, the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership to become the Metropolitan line of the London Passenger Transport Board&#x27;s London Underground, including Quainton Road. The LPTB aimed to move away from freight operations and saw no way in which the rural parts of the MR could be made into viable passenger routes. In 1935, the Brill Tramway was closed. From 1936, underground trains were withdrawn north of Aylesbury, leaving the London and North Eastern Railway (successor to the GCR) as the only operator using the station, although underground services were restored for a short period in the 1940s. In 1963, stopping passenger services were withdrawn, but fast passenger trains continued to pass through. In 1966, the line was closed to passenger traffic and local goods trains ceased using the station. The line through the station was singled and used by occasional freight trains only.

In 1969, the Quainton Road Society was formed with the aim of preserving the station. In 1971, it absorbed the London Railway Preservation Society, taking over its collection of historic railway equipment including many locomotives, and passenger and non-passenger rolling stock. The station was fully restored and reopened as a museum, the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. In addition to the locomotives, stock, and original station buildings, the museum has also acquired the former Oxford Rewley Road railway station and a London Transport building from Wembley Park, both of which have been reassembled on the site. Although no scheduled trains pass through Quainton Road, the station remains connected to the railway network. Freight trains still use this line, and passenger trains still call at the station for special events at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre.

==Origins==

On 15 June 1839, entrepreneur and former Member of Parliament (MP) for Buckingham, Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet, opened the Aylesbury Railway. Built under the direction of Robert Stephenson, it connected the London and Birmingham Railway&#x27;s Cheddington railway station, on the West Coast Main Line, to Aylesbury High Street railway station in eastern Aylesbury, the first station in the Aylesbury Vale. On 1 October 1863, the Wycombe Railway opened a branch line from Princes Risborough railway station to Aylesbury railway station on the western side of Aylesbury, making Aylesbury the terminus of two small and unconnected branch lines.

Meanwhile, to the north of Aylesbury, the Buckinghamshire Railway was being built by Sir Harry Verney. The scheme consisted of a line running roughly south-west to north-east from Oxford to Bletchley, and a line running south-east from Brackley via Buckingham, joining roughly halfway along the Oxford–Bletchley line. The first section opened on 1 May 1850, and the rest opened on 20 May 1851. The Buckinghamshire Railway intended to extend the line southwards to connect to its station at Aylesbury, but this extension was not built.

Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville (10 September 1823 – 26 March 1889), the only son of Richard Plantagenet Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, was in serious financial difficulties by the middle of the 19th century. The 2nd Duke had spent heavily on artworks, womanising, and attempting to influence elections, and by 1847, he was nicknamed &quot;the Greatest Debtor in the World&quot;. Over of the family&#x27;s estates, and their London home at Buckingham House, were sold to meet debts, and the family seat of Stowe House was seized by bailiffs as security and its contents sold. The only property remaining in the control of the Grenville family was the family&#x27;s relatively small ancestral home of Wotton House, and its associated lands around Wotton Underwood in Buckinghamshire. Deeply in debt, the Grenvilles began to look for ways to maximise profits from their remaining farmland around Wotton, and to seek business opportunities in the emerging fields of heavy industry and engineering. Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, who became the Marquess of Chandos on the death of his grandfather Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos in 1839, was appointed chairman of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 27 May 1857. On the death of his father on 29 July 1861, he became the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, and resigned from the chairmanship of the LNWR, returning to Wotton House to manage the family&#x27;s remaining estates.

==Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway==

On 6 August 1860, the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A&amp;B), with the 3rd Duke (then still Marquess of Chandos) as chairman and Sir Harry Verney as deputy chairman, was incorporated by Act of Parliament with the object of connecting the Buckinghamshire Railway (by now operated by the LNWR) to Aylesbury. The 2nd Duke used his influence to ensure the new route would run via Quainton, near his remaining estates around Wotton, instead of the intended more direct route via Pitchcott. Beset by financial difficulties, the line took over eight years to build, eventually opening on 23 September 1868. The new line was connected to the Wycombe Railway&#x27;s Aylesbury station, and joined the existing Buckinghamshire Railway lines at the point where the Oxford–Bletchley line and the line to Buckingham already met. Verney Junction railway station was built at the point where the lines joined, named after Sir Harry who owned the land on which it was built, since there was no nearby town. Aylesbury now had railways to the east, north and southwest, but no line southeast towards London and the Channel ports.

Quainton Road station was built on a curve in the line at the nearest point to the Duke&#x27;s estates at Wotton. Six miles (10 km) northwest of Aylesbury, it was southwest of the small village of Quainton and immediately northwest of the road connecting Quainton to Akeman Street. The railway towards Aylesbury crossed the road via a level crossing immediately southeast of the station. The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway had spent most of their limited budget on the construction of the line itself. Details of the design of the original Quainton Road station are lost, but it is likely that the station had a single timber-covered earth platform and minimal buildings; it was described in 1890 as being extremely primitive.

==Wotton Tramway==
With a railway now running near the boundary of the Wotton House estate at Quainton Road, the 3rd Duke decided to open a small-scale agricultural railway to connect the estate to the railway. The line was intended purely for the transport of construction materials and agricultural produce, and not passengers. The line was to run roughly southwest from Quainton Road to a new railway station near Wotton Underwood. Just west of the station at Wotton the line split. One section would run west to Wood Siding near Brill. A short stub called Church Siding would run northwest into the village of Wotton Underwood itself, terminating near the parish church, and a 1-mile 57 chain (1 mile 1,254 yards; 2.8 km) siding would run north to a coal siding near Kingswood.

He extended it soon afterwards to provide a passenger service to the town of Brill, and the tramway was converted to locomotive operation, known as the Brill Tramway. All goods to and from the Brill Tramway passed through Quainton Road, making it relatively heavily used despite its geographical isolation, and traffic increased further when construction began on Ferdinand de Rothschild&#x27;s mansion of Waddesdon Manor. The plan of extending the Brill Tramway to Oxford, which would have made Quainton Road a major junction station, was abandoned. Instead, the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the Brill Tramway were absorbed by London&#x27;s Metropolitan Railway (MR), which already operated the line from Aylesbury to London. The MR rebuilt Quainton Road and re-sited it to a more convenient location, allowing through running between the Brill Tramway and the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. When the Great Central Railway (GCR) from the north of England opened, Quainton Road became a significant junction at which trains from four directions met, and by far the busiest of the MR&#x27;s rural stations.

Construction began on the line on 8 September 1870. It was built as cheaply as possible, using the cheapest available materials and winding around hills wherever feasible to avoid expensive earthworks. The station platforms were crude earth banks high, held in place by wooden planks. As the Duke intended that the line be worked by horses, it was built with longitudinal sleepers to reduce the risk of them tripping.

On 1 April 1871, the section between Quainton Road and Wotton was formally opened by the Duke in a brief ceremony. At the time of its opening, the line was unnamed, although it was referred to as &quot;The Quainton Tramway&quot; in internal correspondence. The extension from Wotton to Wood Siding was complete by 17 June 1871; the opening date of the northern branch to Kingswood is not recorded, but it was not yet fully open in February 1873. The London and North Western Railway immediately began to operate a dedicated service from Quainton Road, with three vans per week of milk collected from the Wotton estate shipped to Broad Street. Passengers were not carried, other than estate employees and people accompanying livestock.

The tramway did not link to the A&amp;B, but had its own station at Quainton Road at a right angle to the A&amp;B. A diameter turntable at the end of the tramway linked to a spur from the A&amp;B. This spur ran behind a goods shed, joining the A&amp;B line to the northwest of the road. The Tramway had no buildings at Quainton Road, using the A&amp;B&#x27;s facilities when necessary. As the tramway ran on the east side of the road, opposite the station, the spur line had its own level crossing to reach the main line. In 1871, permission was granted to build a direct connection between the two lines, but it was not built.

===Expansion of the Wotton Tramway===

In late 1871, the residents of Brill, the former seat of the Mercian kings and the only significant town near Wotton House, petitioned the Duke to extend the route to Brill and to run a passenger service on the line. In January 1872, a passenger timetable was published for the first time, and the line was officially named the &quot;Wotton Tramway&quot;, but it was commonly known as the &quot;Brill Tramway&quot; from its opening to passengers until closure. The new terminus of Brill opened in March 1872. With horses unable to cope with the loads being carried, the Tramway was upgraded for locomotive use. The lightly laid track with longitudinal sleepers limited the locomotive weight to a maximum of nine tons, lighter than almost all locomotives then available, so it was not possible to use standard locomotives. Two traction engines converted for railway use were bought from Aveling and Porter at a cost of £398 (about £ as of 2025) each. The locomotives were chosen on grounds of weight and reliability, and had a top speed on the level of only , taking 95–98 minutes to travel the six miles (10 km) between Brill and Quainton Road, an average speed of .

The line was heavily used for the shipment of bricks from the brickworks around Brill, and of cattle and milk from the dairy farms on the Wotton estate. By 1875, the line was carrying around 40,000 gallons (180,000 L; 48,000 US gal) of milk each year. Delivery of linseed cake to the dairy farms and of coal to the area&#x27;s buildings were also important uses of the line. The line also began to carry large quantities of manure from London to the area&#x27;s farms, carrying 3,200 tons (3,300 t) in 1872. As it was the only physical link between the Tramway and the national railway network, almost all of this traffic passed through Quainton Road station.

By the mid-1870s, the slow speed of the Aveling and Porter locomotives and their unreliability and inability to handle heavy loads were recognised as major problems for the Tramway. In 1874, Ferdinand de Rothschild bought a site near the Tramway&#x27;s Waddesdon station to use as a site for his country mansion of Waddesdon Manor. The Tramway&#x27;s management recognised that the construction works would lead to a significant increase in the haulage of heavy goods, and that the Aveling and Porter engines would be unable to cope with the increased loads. The newly established engineering firm of W. G. Bagnall wrote to the Duke offering to hire a locomotive to him for trials. The offer was accepted, and on 18 December 1876, the locomotive was delivered. The tests were generally successful, and an order was placed to buy a locomotive from Bagnall for £640 (about £ in 2025) which was delivered on 28 December 1877. With trains now hauled by the Bagnall locomotive (the Kingswood branch generally remained worked by horses, and occasionally by the Aveling and Porter engines), traffic levels soon rose. Milk traffic rose from 40,000 gallons carried in 1875 to 58,000 gallons (260,000 L; 70,000 US gal) in 1879, and in 1877, the Tramway carried a total of 20,994 tons (21,331 t) of goods. In early 1877, the Tramway was shown on &quot;Bradshaw&quot; maps for the first time, and from May 1882 &quot;Bradshaw&quot; included its timetable.
Although the introduction of the Bagnall locomotives and the traffic generated by the works at Waddesdon Manor had boosted the line&#x27;s fortunes, it remained in serious financial difficulty. The only connection with the national railway network was by the turntable at Quainton Road. Although the 3rd Duke of Buckingham was both the owner of the Wotton Tramway and Chairman of the A&amp;B, the latter regarded the Tramway as a nuisance, and in the 1870s, pursued a policy of charging disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line, with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business. A&amp;B trains would deliberately miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped via Quainton Road to become unsellable. The Tramway sought legal advice and was informed that the Duke would be likely to win a legal action against the A&amp;B. However, the A&amp;B was in such a precarious financial position that any successful legal action against it would likely have forced its through Quainton Road to close, severing the Tramway&#x27;s connection with the national network. Many Tramway passengers changed trains at Quainton Road to continue their journey on the A&amp;B; in 1885, 5,192 passengers did so. The Tramway&#x27;s management suggested that the A&amp;B subsidise the Tramway to the sum of £25 (about £ in 2025) per month to allow passenger services to continue, but the A&amp;B agreed to pay only £5 (about £ in 2025) per month. By the mid-1880s, the Tramway was finding it difficult to cover the operating expenses of either goods or passenger operations.

==Metropolitan Railway takeover of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway==

Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had proposed the idea of an underground railway connecting the City of London with the relatively distant main-line termini in around 1840. Construction began in 1860. On 9 January 1863, the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world&#x27;s first underground passenger railway. The MR was successful and grew steadily, extending its services and acquiring other local railways north and west of London. In 1872, Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was appointed its chairman. A director of many railway companies, he had a vision of unifying a string of railways to create a single line from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873, Watkin entered negotiations to take control of the A&amp;B and the section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury and the Tramway southwest to Oxford, creating a through route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London at this time were poor: although still an extremely roundabout route, this scheme would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford upon Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was enthusiastic, and authorisation was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm of Watkin and the Duke, and in 1875, the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected. Watkin did, however, receive consent in 1881 to extend the MR to Aylesbury.

==Wotton Tramway Oxford extension scheme==

With the MR extension to Aylesbury approved, in March 1883, the Duke announced his own scheme to extend the Tramway to Oxford. The turntable at Quainton Road would be replaced by a junction to the south of the turntable to allow through running of trains. The stretch from Quainton Road to Brill would be straightened and improved to main-line standards, and the little-used stations at Waddesdon Road and Wood Siding would be closed. From Brill, the line would pass in a tunnel through Muswell Hill to the south of Brill, and on via Boarstall before crossing from Buckinghamshire into Oxfordshire at Stanton St. John, calling at Headington on the outskirts of Oxford and terminating at a station to be built in the back garden of 12 High Street, St Clement&#x27;s, near Magdalen Bridge.

At , the line would have been by far the shortest route between Oxford and Aylesbury, compared with via the Great Western Railway (GWR), which had absorbed the Wycombe Railway, and via the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the LNWR. The Act of Parliament authorising the scheme received the Royal Assent on 20 August 1883, and the new Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company, including the Duke of Buckingham, Ferdinand de Rothschild and Harry Verney among its directors, was created. The scheme caught the attention of the expansionist Metropolitan Railway, who paid for the survey to be conducted. Despite the scheme&#x27;s powerful backers, the expensive Muswell Hill tunnel deterred investors and the company found it difficult to raise capital. De Rothschild promised to lend money for the scheme in return for guarantees that the line would include a passenger station at Westcott, and that the Duke would press the A&amp;B into opening a station at the nearest point to Waddesdon Manor. Waddesdon Manor railway station was duly opened on 1 January 1897.

==Oxford &amp; Aylesbury Tramroad==

The new company was unable to raise sufficient investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had been given only five years by Parliament to build it. On 7 August 1888, less than two weeks before the authorisation was due to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received the Royal Assent for a revised and much cheaper version. To be called the Oxford &amp; Aylesbury Tramroad (O&amp;AT), this envisaged the extension being built to the same light specifications as the existing Tramway.

On 26 March 1889, the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos died, aged 65. By this time the construction of the MR extension to Aylesbury was well underway, and on 1 July 1891, the MR formally absorbed the A&amp;B. Sir Harry Verney died on 12 February 1894, and on 31 March 1894, the MR took over the operation of the A&amp;B from the GWR. On 1 July 1894, the MR extension to Aylesbury was completed, giving the MR a unified route from London to Verney Junction. The MR embarked on a programme of upgrading and rebuilding the stations along the newly acquired line.

Construction from Brill to Oxford had not yet begun. Further Acts of Parliament were granted in 1892 and 1894, varying the proposed route slightly and allowing for its electrification, but no work was carried out other than some preliminary surveying. On 1 April 1894, with the proposed extension to Oxford still intended, the O&amp;AT exercised a clause of the 1888 Act and took over the Tramway. Work began on upgrading the line in preparation for the extension. The line from Quainton Road to Brill was relaid with improved rails on transverse sleepers, replacing the original flimsy rails and longitudinal sleepers. At around this time, two Manning Wardle locomotives were brought into use.

==Re-siting==
The rebuilding of the Tramway greatly improved service speeds, reducing journey times between Quainton Road and Brill to between 35 and 43 minutes. The population of the area had remained low; in 1901, Brill had a population of only 1,206. Passenger traffic remained a relatively insignificant part of the Tramway&#x27;s business, and in 1898 passenger receipts were only £24 per month (about £ in 2025).
Quainton Road had seen little change since its construction by the A&amp;B in 1868, and in 1890 was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;one of the most primitive-looking stations in the British Isles&quot;. While the line to Brill was being upgraded, the MR were rebuilding and re-siting Quainton Road as part of its improvement programme, freeing space for a direct link between the former A&amp;B and the O&amp;AT to be built. The new station was re-sited to the southeast of the road, on the same side as the turntable connection with the Tramway. The new station had two platforms on the former A&amp;B line and a third platform for Brill trains. In 1896, the level crossings around the station were replaced by a road bridge over the railway. A curve between the former A&amp;B and the Tramway opened on 1 January 1897, allowing through running without the need to turn the engine and carriages individually on the turntable for the first time. The MR made a concerted effort to generate passenger traffic on the line. From 1910 to 1914, Pullman cars operated between Aldgate and Verney Junction, calling at Quainton Road, and a luxurious hotel was built in the new village of Verney Junction.

==Metropolitan Railway takeover of Oxford &amp; Aylesbury Tramroad services==
By 1899, the MR and the O&amp;AT were cooperating closely. Although the line had been upgraded in preparation for the Oxford extension and had been authorised as a railway in 1894, construction of the extension had yet to begin. On 27 November, the MR arranged to lease the Tramway from the O&amp;AT, for an annual fee of £600 (about £ in 2025) with an option to buy the line outright. From 1 December 1899, the MR took over all operations on the Tramway. The O&amp;AT&#x27;s single passenger coach, a relic of Wotton Tramway days, was removed from its wheels and used as a platelayer&#x27;s hut at Brill. An elderly Brown, Marshalls and Co passenger coach was transferred to the line to replace it, and a section of each platform was raised to accommodate the higher doors of this coach, using earth and old railway sleepers.

D class locomotives, introduced by the MR to improve services on the former Tramway line, damaged the track, and in 1910, the line between Quainton Road and Brill was relaid to MR standards using old track removed from the inner London MR route, still considered adequate for light use on a rural branch line. Following this track upgrading, the speed limit was increased to . The MR was unhappy with the performance and safety record of the D Class locomotives, and sold them to other railways between 1916 and 1922, replacing them with A class locomotives.

==Great Central Railway==
In 1893, another of Edward Watkin&#x27;s railways, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, had been authorised to build a new line from Annesley in Nottinghamshire south to Quainton Road. Watkin had intended to run services from Manchester and Sheffield via Quainton Road and along the MR to Baker Street. Following Watkin&#x27;s retirement in 1894, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway obtained permission for a separate station in London near Baker Street at Marylebone, and the line was renamed the Great Central Railway (GCR). The new line joined the MR just north of Quainton Road, and opened to passengers on 15 March 1899.

Although it served a lightly populated area, the opening of the GCR made Quainton Road an important junction station at which four railway lines met. The number of passengers using the station rose sharply. It had many passengers in comparison to other stations in the area. In 1932, the last year of private operation, the station saw 10,598 passenger journeys, earning a total of £601 (about £ in 2025) in passenger receipts.

Quainton Road was by far the busiest of the MR&#x27;s rural passenger stations north of Aylesbury. Verney Junction railway station saw only 943 passenger journeys in the same year, and the five other stations on the Brill Tramway had a combined passenger total of 7,761.

===Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway===

Following Watkin&#x27;s retirement, relations between the GCR and the MR deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London ran over the MR from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the hostile MR, GCR General Manager William Pollitt decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway and a route into London that bypassed the MR. In 1899, the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began construction of a new line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR at Princes Risborough to the GCR at Grendon Underwood, about three miles (5 km) north of Quainton Road. Although formally an independent company, the new line was operated as a part of the GCR. A substantial part of GCR traffic to and from London was diverted onto the Alternative Route, reducing the significance of Quainton Road as an interchange and damaging the profitability of the MR.

==London Transport==

On 1 July 1933 the MR, along with London&#x27;s other underground railways aside from the short Waterloo &amp; City Railway, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). Despite being from London, Quainton Road became part of the London Underground network. By this time, the lines from Quainton Road to Verney Junction and Brill were in severe decline. Competition from the newer lines and from improving road haulage had drawn away much of the Tramway&#x27;s custom in particular, and Brill trains would often run without a single passenger.

Frank Pick, managing director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services and concentrate on the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. He saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes. On 1 June 1935, the LPTB gave the required six months&#x27; notice to the O&amp;AT that it intended to terminate operations on the Brill Tramway.

==Closure==

The last scheduled passenger train on the Brill Tramway left Quainton Road in the afternoon of 30 November 1935. Hundreds of people gathered, and a number of members of the Oxford University Railway Society travelled from Oxford in an effort to buy the last ticket. Accompanied by firecrackers and fog signals, the train ran to Brill, where the passengers posed for a photograph. Late that evening, a two-coach staff train pulled out of Brill, accompanied by a band bearing a white flag and playing Auld Lang Syne. The train stopped at each station, picking up the staff, documents and valuables from each. At 11.45 pm the train arrived at Quainton Road, greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts. At the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the Tramway to the main line were ceremonially severed.

Quainton Road remained open, but with the closure of the Brill Tramway it was no longer a significant junction. The line to Verney Junction was closed to passengers on 6 July 1936. London Transport passenger services beyond Aylesbury were withdrawn, leaving the former GCR (part of the London and North Eastern Railway after 1923) as the only passenger services to Quainton Road. .A connection between the GCR and the former Buckinghamshire Railway at Calvert was opened in 1942.London Transport services were briefly restored in 1943 with the extension of the Metropolitan line&#x27;s London–Aylesbury service to Quainton Road, but this service was once more withdrawn in 1948.

London Transport reduced the A&amp;B route between Quainton Road and Verney Junction to a single track in 1939–40. LT continued to operate freight services until 6 September 1947, when the Quainton Road–Verney Junction route closed altogether, 

Quainton Road closed to passengers on 4 March 1963 and to goods on 4 July 1966. On 3 September 1966, passenger services on the GCR line from Aylesbury to Rugby were withdrawn, leaving only the stretch from Aylesbury to Calvert, running through the now-closed Quainton Road, open for freight trains. This was reduced to a single track shortly afterwards. The signal box at Quainton Road was abandoned on 13 August 1967, and the points connecting to the goods yard were disconnected.

==Restoration==
While other closed stations on the former MR lines north of Aylesbury were generally demolished or sold, in 1969 the Quainton Railway Society was formed to operate a working museum at the station. On 24 April 1971, the society absorbed the London Railway Preservation Society, taking custody of its collection of historic railway equipment. The station was maintained in working order and used as a bookshop and ticket office, and the sidings—still intact, although disconnected from the railway line in 1967—were used for locomotive restoration work.

The Quainton Railway Society, which operates the station as the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre, restored the main station building to its 1900 appearance. A smaller building on the former Brill platform, once a shelter for passengers waiting for Brill and down trains, was used first as a store then as a shop for a number of years before its current use to house an exhibit on the history of the Brill Tramway. A former London Transport building from Wembley Park was dismantled and re-erected at Quainton Road to serve as a maintenance shed. From 1984 until 1990, the station briefly came back into passenger use, when special Saturday Christmas shopping services between Aylesbury and were operated by British Rail Network SouthEast on Saturdays only, and stopped at Quainton Road. From August Bank Holiday 1971 until the 1987 season, and again from August Bank Holiday 2001, the station has had special passenger trains from Aylesbury in connection with events at the centre – these shuttles now run regularly each Spring and August Bank Holiday weekend.
Rewley Road, the Oxford terminus of Harry Verney&#x27;s Buckinghamshire Railway and of the Oxford to Cambridge Line, closed to passengers on 1 October 1951 with trains diverted to the former GWR Oxford General, the current Oxford station. In co-operation with the Science Museum, Rewley Road was dismantled in 1999, the main station building and part of the platform canopy being moved to Quainton Road for preservation and improved visitor facilities with the main shop and office of the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre, thus maintaining it as a working building. A number of former Ministry of Supply food warehouses in what is now the extended Down Yard have been converted for various uses by the Society, including storage and exhibition of rolling stock.

Although the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre&#x27;s steam trains run on the sidings which were disconnected from the network in 1967, the station still has a working railway line running to it, used for occasional special passenger trains from Aylesbury in connection with events at the centre. Regular freight trains, mainly landfill trains from waste transfer depots in Greater London to the former brick pits at Calvert, passed through until October 2021, when Network Rail closed the line to the north and lifted the tracks. In 2023, the Station Road bridge was in-filled with foamed concrete to strengthen it until its replacement is opened at which point the tracks to the north will be replaced. In 2010, the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre was negotiating for a reconnection of the link between its sidings and the main line, to allow the centre&#x27;s locomotives to run to Aylesbury when the line is not in use by freight trains, and to rebuild part of the Brill Tramway between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road.

==Media use==
Quainton Road Station was used for the filming location for the video for The Tourists&#x27; single &quot;So Good To Be Back Home Again&quot; in 1980.

As one of the best-preserved period railway stations in England, Quainton Road is regularly used as a filming location for period drama, and programmes such as &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;, the Doctor Who serial &quot;Black Orchid&quot;, and the ITV series &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; have been filmed there.

<text>The portable [[desk]] had many forms and is an ancestor of the portable computer, the modern laptop an atavistic grandchild of the 19th-century lap desk.

==Medieval era and Renaissance==
All desks were portable to some extent, from medieval times to the end of the Renaissance, with the exception of built-in tables and inclined ranks of desks found in places such as the scriptorium or library of a monastery. This was due to the itinerant nature of medieval kingship and the similar conditions that prevailed in lesser administrations under dukes or counts. There was rarely a single capital for a kingdom, and the monarch and his (or her) court would travel periodically between several seats of power during the year, taking precious goods and much of their furniture with them. A good example of this is Henry VIII&#x27;s writing desk. The traditional French words for furniture – &quot;le mobilier&quot; and &quot;les meubles&quot; – reflect this. They describe those goods that are &quot;mobile&quot;, in contrast to those that are not: &quot;les immeubles&quot;, that is, buildings.

The desks in medieval woodcuts and other illustrations of the period were massive affairs, but could be hauled by several men. Some were made of pieces that could be knocked down for transport. The trestle desk was a common form for the period. It was usually fitted with a slanted top.

In the homes of lesser nobles and certain members of the merchant classes the portable furniture never travelled very far. Most domestic life took place in a single large hall. Furniture was constantly shifted around, stored and often disassembled to suit the role the great room was playing at a particular time in the day or the month.

==Varguenos, bible boxes and other chests==

There are two survivors of these medieval and renaissance forms: the rather large Bargueño desk or Vargueno, a chest desk from 16th-century Spain, and the relatively small Bible box, which probably had a later origin. These two forms are usually not employed as portable desks any more, but they are bought and sold as antiques or as reproductions and usually valued as much for their monetary worth or their aesthetic appeal as for their practical use.

The lap desk appeared sometime in the 17th century and became a stylish accessory for travelling gentlemen. Like the Bible box, the lap desk was usually small enough to be carried on a horse or by a gentleman&#x27;s butler or valet. From the 18th century onward, however, it grew in size and became too heavy to be used comfortably on a lap. Several regional variations, such as the French escritoire, were developed.

At the other end of the scale, the 17th century saw the appearance of several other kinds of &quot;chest&quot; desks, such as those destined for use in ships or for getting paperwork done during a military campaign. These were usually known as the campaign desk and the field desk.

==Decline==

Most portable desks gradually disappeared during the 19th century, as useful day-to-day writing tools. The introduction of mass literacy during that period, the invention of cheaper and more efficient writing implements, and the mass production of furniture made most portable desks redundant.

With the advent of clean writing surfaces in every home or place of business and of the small and clean pocket fountain pen and the pencil, a gentleman did not need to include a lap desk in his luggage. There was no need for a container for the quill, the blotter, and the sand tray or for the writing surface this container could offer. Ships eventually were constructed with built-in desks, making the portable desk obsolete in maritime environments.

The only modern survivors of all the antique forms of the portable desk are the bed variants of the lap desk and a series of standardized forms (following NATO specifications or others) of the field desk.

<text>City Road is a disused London Underground station in Islington, central London. It was opened in 1901 as part of the City &amp; South London Railway&#x27;s extension from Moorgate Street to Angel. The station was located on the City Road between Old Street and Angel stations. The railway is now part of the Northern line.

The station was closed in 1922 due to low passenger usage. The underground tunnels remain at track level, but the station remained derelict until the 1960s, when it was demolished except for the structure around the original lift shaft. This remained at City Road&#x27;s junction with Central Street and Moreland Street until the late 2010s, when it was replaced by the Bunhill 2 Energy Centre.

==History==

From the start, City Road station was little used, and discussions of its closure were held as early as 1908: less than seven years after it was opened. The station was close to both Old Street and Angel, and was in a deprived area of Islington. However, City Road remained until 8 August 1922 when the City &amp; South London Railway&#x27;s northern section between Euston and Moorgate Street was closed to enable the diameter of the tunnels to be increased from to the Underground&#x27;s standard diameter of , so that larger and longer Standard Stock trains could be operated.

Low passenger usage meant that the required expansion of the platform tunnels and upgrading of the station could not be justified on financial grounds, and City Road remained closed when the line was reopened on 20 April 1924. The platforms were removed and the lift shaft was converted for use as a ventilation shaft. City Road was the only twin tunnel station on the line not to be reconstructed. During the Second World War the station was converted for use as an air-raid shelter.
The station building remained until the 1960s, when all but the structure immediately around the original lift shaft was demolished. At track level the temporary structures for the air-raid shelter were removed after the war and the site of the platforms can be seen from passing trains.

Planning permission was granted in 2015 to demolish the remaining station structure for phase 2 of Islington Borough Council&#x27;s scheme to heat the nearby King Square council estate. The Bunhill 2 Energy Centre opened on the site in 2020, capturing waste heat from the Northern Line tunnels to provide heat to additional residential buildings and a school.
==Accidents==

On 26 August 1916 a passenger was killed when a guard signalled for a train to depart before all of the passengers had alighted.

<doc id="354313" wikidata="Q502371" url="?curid=354313" title="West Lake">
<text>The West Lake (; ) is a freshwater lake in Hangzhou, China. Situated to the west of Hangzhou&#x27;s former walled city, the lake has a surface area of , stretching from north to south and from east to west. In the lake are four causeways, three artificial islands, and the Gushan, the only natural island. Gentle hills surround the lake on its north, west, and south sides, with the Leifeng and Baochu pagodas standing in pair on the south and north banks. Several famous temples are nestled in the mountains west of the lake, including the temples of Lingying and Jingci.

A tourist attraction since the Tang dynasty (618–907), the lake has influenced poets and painters throughout Chinese history for its natural beauty and historic relics. By the Song dynasty (960–1279), during which the dynastic capital moved to Hangzhou, it had become a cultural landmark and one of the most visited tourist destinations of China. Introduced to Europeans by Marco Polo, the lake was once a symbol of Chinese urban culture. It has been featured on Chinese currency, including the one-yuan banknote in the 1979 Bank of China Foreign Exchange Certificate and the 2005 Renminbi, as well as in the Chinese passport. A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2011, the lake is recognised to have influenced garden designs in China, Japan and Korea over the centuries, as &quot;an idealised fusion between humans and nature.&quot;

The lake, along with the surrounding hills, constitutes the West Lake Scenic Area, which is governed by the Management Committee of Hangzhou West Lake Scenic Area, a special administration dedicated to cultural preservation and gardening under the Hangzhou municipal government since 2002. The first major Chinese tourist attraction to cancel admission fees, the scenic area is crowded during public holidays. In the 2024 National Day holiday, the area received 4.426 million visitors in seven days, a 30.92% rise from the previous year.

== Names ==
Historically, the lake has been referred to by various names, including the Qiantang Lake. The first description of the waters near Hangzhou was made in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; finished in 111, which states,

This statement about the Wulin River (武林水) is widely interpreted as the first mention of the West Lake, while the Wulin Hills (武林山) were believed to be the hills near the Lingyin Temple.

Bai Juyi was among the first to refer to the lake as &quot;West Lake&quot;, due to its location to the west of the city. Su Shi was the first to use the name in official documents, in his request to the Imperial Court for the dredging of the lake in 1090. The 16th century Chinese scholars considered the West Lake of Hangzhou to be the most famous among the 35 other lakes with the same name in China. In English, the name is also Romanised as Xi Hu, or the Xi Lake. Due to Su Shi&#x27;s famous comparison with Xizi, the lake is also called Xizi Lake.

==History==

=== Natural formation and dredging efforts ===
About 4,400 to 2,500 years ago, as sea levels fell, the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou plain began to emerge, while the West Lake was merely a shallow bay. Over time, the Qiantang River gradually deposited sand and rocks outside this bay. About 2,000 years ago, a lagoon was formed. Streams from the surrounding mountains transformed the water into freshwater, but ongoing silt deposits gradually reduced the lake to a swamp. In local folklore, when Qin Shi Huang (259–210 BC), the first emperor of China, visited Hangzhou, the West Lake was still part of the Qiantang River. The giant rock on the north bank of the West Lake was said to be where the emperor anchored his fleet. According to &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, during his visit in 210 BC, the emperor was halted in Hangzhou by the strong tide of the Qiantang River and had to take a detour westward to reach Shaoxing. During the Eastern Han era (25–220), local official Hua Xin ordered the construction of a seawall to completely cut the lake off from the sea. In 591, the government seat of Hangzhou, originally on the west shore, was relocated to the newly built walled city east to the lake. With the completion of the Grand Canal, Hangzhou, as its destination, became a transport hub of China.

Before the Tang dynasty (618–907), the West Lake was a small and shallow body of water, but continuous dredging efforts prevented it from becoming a swamp. During the Jianzhong period (780–783) of the Tang dynasty, local official Li Mi diverted water from the into Hangzhou via an underground pipes, creating six ponds to secure the city&#x27;s water supply. In 822, Bai Juyi dredged the West Lake and used the silt to build a long causeway between Qiantang and Yuhang Gates, which was named in his memory. Under the Wuyue Kingdom (907–932), with Hangzhou being the capital, King Qian Liu ordered annual dredging of the West Lake with soldiers to maintain water quality for water supply. In the Song dynasty, Su Shi (1037–1101) ordered the construction of the Su Causeway from dredged silt in 1089. He designated an area of the lake with three stone pagodas to prevent water chestnut planting and reduce silting, which may mark the origin of the &quot;Three Ponds Mirroring the Moon.&quot; By 1275, military patrols were appointed to maintain and police the lake, where littering of any rubbish or planting additional lotuses or water-chestnuts were forbidden.

=== From literary tradition to tourism ===

Literary works by renowned literati contributed to the fame of the West Lake among Chinese intellectuals. Especially, the lake became associated with the two greatest poets of Middle-Period China, Bai Juyi and Su Shi. Su Xiaoxiao, a famous courtesan and poet of Southern Qi (479–502), was buried upon the West Lake. Her life and poetry have inspired later poets, including Li He and Wen Tingyun. Over time, local history became intertwined with the natural beauty. For example, Bai Juyi celebrates Su Xiaoxiao&#x27;s beauty and her connection to the enchanting scenery of the lake in one of his poem. When Su Shi (1037–1101) famously compared the West Lake to Xizi, one of the Four Beauties of ancient China, the lake became known as the Xizi Lake:
During the period of Wuyue Kingdom (907–978), numerous temples, pagodas, shrines, and grottoes were built or expanded around the lake, including Lingyin, Zhaoqing, Jingci, Li’an, Liutong, and Taoguang temples, as well as the Baochu, Liuhe, Leifeng, and White pagodas, due to the devotion of its rulers to Buddhism. Since the 12th and 13th centuries, these temples, frequently visited by Japanese monks, played a significant role in circulating cultural images of the lake across East Asia, as these visitors returned to their home countries.

Wars and conflicts in northern China during the Song dynasty—including invasions by the Khitan, Jurchen, and Mongols—triggered significant migration southward to the new capital, leading to urbanisation and economic prosperity. With city walls blocking much of the natural scenery, the West Lake became a favoured destination for urban residents seeking respite from the demands of city life and political turmoil. Since 1129, the capital of the Song dynasty was relocated to Hangzhou, after the country lost its northern territories to the Jurchen. The imperial examination held every three years filled Hangzhou with educated individuals, who often enjoyed the lake&#x27;s beauty and consulted fortune-tellers at lakeside temples. Visiting the West Lake inspired poems that reflected on their experiences and memories of the scenery.
By the late Song dynasty, the West Lake had evolved into a significant hub where tourism emerged. While pilgrimage and contemplative retreat had previously been the main motives for travel, sightseeing gained wide acceptance as an activity focused on enjoyment and the appreciation of natural beauty, roughly at the same time as in western Europe. Aesthetic appreciation of landscapes became a popular business, with diverse entertainment options which involved standardised routes and viewing orders made available to cater to various preferences and budgets. Tour guides, seasonal markets and specialty shops emerged. The notion of Ten Scenes of West Lake was invented. Boating on the lake was a popular pastime, with records noting hundreds of intricately carved, elegantly decorated boats gliding gracefully over the water.

Shortly after the Mongol conquest of China, the West Lake remained socially vibrant. The official records show that in 1309, the city received more than 1,200 foreign visitors within half a year, many from Turkestan and Europe. The West Lake was dredged and renamed the “Pond of Freeing Captive Animals” under Kublai Khan, while parts of the lake area were gradually cultivated into farmland. Among the visitors was Marco Polo, who describes the lake in his book,

=== Mongol rule and fall of tourism ===
The booming tourism led to different interpretations. The lake was regarded as a literary tradition, a symbol of the state and a part of local history and knowledge, but for some, a symbol of extravagance and luxury. One of the most famous portrayal comes from Lin Sheng, who penned a poem as a satirical commentary on how people were engrossed in their indulgence in Hangzhou&#x27;s pleasures, rather than making efforts to reclaim the lost northern capital:
In 1142, Yue Fei, a hawkish Chinese general known for his determined efforts to reclaim northern China, was executed by the dovish emperor and his chief councillor. Yue&#x27;s death marked the end of attempts to recapture the north, as the emperor prioritised peace despite the Song army&#x27;s successes. Yue Fei remained widely admired among Chinese people and was widely celebrated as a national hero. In 1162, his wrongful execution was acknowledged, and his remains were moved to a tomb by the West Lake. Since 1221, a nearby temple has been repurposed in his memory.

The Mongol-led Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) saw the decline of tourism at the West Lake. Government support for maintaining the lake diminished, as Mongol rulers placed their political and economic focus on northern China rather than the south. The Mongol rulers, as well as local residents, blamed the lavish life upon the lake for the fall of Song. Therefore, the lake was abandoned. When the Ming dynasty replaced Mongol rule, Hangzhou gradually regained its prosperity by the mid-15th century. However, the lake experienced droughts in 1442 and 1456, causing it to dry up temporarily.

=== Revitalisation in Late Imperial China ===
Since the mid-Ming era, renewed dredging projects rekindled public interest in West Lake. As Hangzhou developed as a publishing centre, the production of geographic texts stimulated tourism, which in turn further fuelled the publishing industry. In 1508, Hangzhou governor Yang Mengying led a major dredging effort, repairing the Su and Bai Causeways and creating the Yanggong Causeway in his memory. This restoration returned the lake&#x27;s appearance to its Tang dynasty splendour. Further construction works in 1576, 1607-1611 and 1621 built the Mid-lake Pavilion and the Lesser Yingzhou Islet. The period of time saw the publication of a series of books on local history and culture which depicted the West Lake, inspiring Japanese gardens such as the Kyū Shiba Rikyū Garden.

The Manchu conquered Hangzhou in 1645, which led to the construction of the Manchu city alongside the West Lake. During the High Qing era (1683–1799), emperors frequented southern China, to symbolise their control over China. Due to the visits by the Manchu emperors, the lake was fully dredged and renovated. In 1689, a temporary imperial palace was built on the Gushan. In 1722, Zhejiang governor Li Wei was ordered to dredge the lake. In 1809, the Ruangongdun Islet was built with silted soil, which was named after Ruan Yuan, then governor of Zhejiang.

The emperors revived and standardised the notion of the Ten Scenes of West Lake. The Kangxi Emperor inscribed titles for these scenes, which were later carved into stelae beneath ten pavilions. The Qianlong Emperor composed poems during his visits, which were then inscribed on the reverse side of Kangxi&#x27;s stelae. He further inscribed the Eight Scenes of Dragon Well in the surrounding hills. In Beijing, imperial gardens, including the Garden of Delighted Spring and the Old Summer Palace, were designed to imitate the landscape designs of West Lake.

After the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864) destroyed the buildings beside the lake, the West Lake revived, as major Qing military leaders, magnates and ranking officials, such as Peng Yulin built their villas upon the lake, which later became their memorial temples and shrines that were later maintained by a dedicated division of local government. In 1864, the West Lake Dredging Bureau was established, to manage the dredging of the West Lake.

===Modern era===

Following the 1911 revolution that ended the Qing dynasty, the Manchu Banner Garrison was dismantled, and imperial properties around the West Lake were nationalised. A new business area was built at the former site of the Manchu Banner Garrison, which integrated the West Lake into the city. The former imperial garden was converted into Zhongshan Park, named in honour of Sun Yat-sen. The buildings associated with former Qing officials and generals were renamed to honour Ming loyalists, such as the Shrine of Former Martyrs. The railway link between Hangzhou and Shanghai, completed in 1909, stimulated local tourism. A great number of lakeside villas and garden were built, with the city walls torn down and tombs disallowed to be built around the lake.The visitors to the lake included notable literati, such as Rabindranath Tagore and Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, as well as the couple of Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling spent their honeymoon by the lake. In 1922, the Chinese Communist Party held the Hangzhou Plenum here, initiating the first collaboration with Nationalists. In 1928, the National Academy of Art was founded on Gushan Island. In March 1937, Zhou Enlai and Chiang Kai-shek held a secret meeting at Yanxia Cave near the lake to negotiate a coalition against Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

The Japanese seized Hangzhou in December 1937. Under Japanese rule, deforestation of the mountains surrounding West Lake led to rapid silting of the lake from soil erosion, due to a lack of maintenance. A Japanese shrine was built by the lake in October 1939, where the Japanese autumn festival was held to familiarise the ordinary Chinese people with Japanese Shinto. With the Japanese surrender in 1945, tourism at West Lake flourished once again, although the city itself faced severe economic challenges due to hyperinflation.

The Communists took Hangzhou shortly after the Nationalist retreat from the city to preserve the cultural relics of the West Lake in 1949. In the 1950s, major hydrological works, along with other construction projects, took place, to exemplify socialist achievements. Hangzhou Botanical Garden and a flower garden was opened on the lake&#x27;s west shore. The parks of Fish Viewing at the Flower Pond and Orioles Singing in the Willows were constructed. Lingyin Temple, Jingci Temple, Yue-Wang Temple, Three Ponds Mirroring the Moon, Mid-lake Pavilion and other spots were renovated. Since 1953, Mao Zedong stayed periodically at West Lake every year until his death in 1976. To ensure his safety, the local government forcibly relocated residents suspected of connections with the Nationalists to labour camps. Shops near the lake were acquired by the state, and undercover security personnel were stationed at over 100 shops in the area. The tombs of notable figures—including Wu Song, Fang La, Yu Qian, Zhang Cangshui, Su Manshu, Su Xiaoxiao, and the Stuart family—as well as the temples of Yue Fei and Wen Tianxiang, were destroyed. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Liutong Temple and another temple were destroyed. Zhou Enlai ordered the closure of the Lingyin Temple to prevent it from being destroyed, but repairs were later made to many scenic sites, due to the visits by Norodom Sihanouk and Richard Nixon in 1972.After 1976, tourism to the lake revitalised. In 1983, the Hangzhou government refurbished temples and pavilions upon the lake. They also expanded Galloping Tiger Spring and established Curved Yard and Lotus Pool in Summer Park. The new site Exploring Plum Blossoms at Ling Peak was introduced, complemented by cultural events at Huanglong Cave and Ruangongdun Islet. In 1984, local media and societies held public vote to select the new &quot;Ten Scenes&quot; of the lake. In 1985, a pump at Zhakou to draw 300,000 cubic meters of water daily, were built to refresh the water in the lake. A sewage interception project, completed in 1981, installed over 17 kilometres of buried tunnels and 10 pumping stations. In 2000, the West Lake exposition was relaunched, drawing 1.4 million visitors. In 2002, Leifeng Pagoda was rebuilt where it collapsed in 1924. During the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit and the 2023 Asian Games, West Lake State Guest House was where Chinese president Xi Jinping met with foreign guests, such as Barack Obama and Narendra Modi.

==General layout==

The layout of the West Lake features &quot;one hill, two pagodas, three islets, four causeways and five lakes.&quot; Among them, ten classic scenic places are collectively known as the &quot;Ten Scenes of West Lake&quot;.

=== Solitary Hill ===
The Gushan (孤山), or the Solitary Hill, is the only natural island on the West Lake. Connected to the northern shore by Xiling Bridge and Bai Causeway, Solitary Hill and Bai Causeway separate the North Inner Lake from the Outer West Lake. In local folklore, the island is grouped with the Broken Bridge and the Long Bridge as the &quot;Three Oddities of West Lake&quot;: the Broken Bridge is not broken, Solitary Hill is not solitary, and the Long Bridge is not long. During the Qing dynasty, Solitary Hill became part of a detached palace for emperors visiting Hangzhou. Wenlan Pavilion, the royal library on the island, housed a valuable collection of literary works and rare texts. After the 1911 revolution, the palace grounds were transformed into Zhongshan Park to honor Sun Yat-sen, a key figure in the revolution. The Wenlan Pavilion and other former palace buildings were incorporated into the Zhejiang Provincial Museum, while a new building next to the Pavilion was completed in 1912 to host the Zhejiang Library.

=== Two pagodas ===

Leifeng Pagoda (), originally built in 975, is located on Sunset Hill. According to local tales, it plays a central role in the legend of the White Snake. Leifeng Pagoda was rebuilt in 2002 after the original structure collapsed in 1924, and it remains a popular tourist spot with stunning views of the lake.

Baochu Pagoda (, built in 963, stands on Precious Stone Hill. Unlike the more elaborate Leifeng Pagoda, Baochu is a slender, simple structure believed to have been built to pray for the safe return of a local official.

=== Three islets ===
There are three artificial islets on the West: Lesser Yingzhou Islet, Mid-lake Pavilion, and Ruangong Islet. Each was constructed during the Ming and Qing dynasties by dredging lake sediment.

* Lesser Yingzhou Islet (, also known as Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, is especially famous for the small stone pagodas that rise from the water around it. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, these pagodas are lit, creating a scene called &quot;Three Pools Mirroring the Moon&quot;, which has become one of the &quot;Ten Scenes of West Lake.&quot;
* Mid-lake Pavilion (), the smallest of the three, is a pavilion surrounded by the Outer West Lake. It is renowned for Zhang Dai&#x27;s essay on watching the snow from the pavilion.
* Ruan Gong Islet (), constructed in 1800, is named after Ruan Yuan, who was the Governor of Zhejiang at the time. Currently, the islet is not open to visitors, as it serves as a natural reserve.

=== Four causeways ===
Three major causeways divide the West Lake into five sections, which include:
* Bai Causeway () – Originally called the White Sand Causeway, it was naturally formed before the Tang dynasty (618–907) and reinforced between 766 and 779. The causeway collapsed during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) and was rebuilt in 1589. By the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), the causeway became known as the Bai Causeway, in his memory.
* Su Causeway () – Built in 1089 under the direction of Su Shi during his term as mayor, this causeway, along with six bridges to allow ferry passages, connects Quyuan on the north shore to Huagang on the south shore. It separates the West Inner Lake from the Outer West Lake.
* Yanggong Causeway () – Constructed in 1508 by local official Yang Mengying to mitigate flooding, this causeway features six bridges that facilitate ferry access between the West Inner Lake and Outer West Lake.
Additionally, Zhaogong Causeway (), also known as the Jinsha Causeway, was built in 1242, connecting Quyuan to the Su Causeway. It was named after Zhao Yuchou, then-mayor of Lin&#x27;an.

=== Five lakes ===
The current lake, roughly oval in shape, was dredged during past dynasties and spans 3.3 km from north to south, 2.8 km from east to west, with a shoreline circumference of 15 km and a total water area of 5.6 square kilometres. Divided by Gushan Hill, the Su Causeway, and the Bai Causeway, it consists of five distinct water bodies interconnected by bridge arches.
* The Main Lake is bordered by Hubin Road to the east, Su Causeway to the west, Nanshan Road to the south, and Bai Causeway to the north.
* The West Inner Lake lies west of the Su Causeway.
* The North Inner Lake, also known as the Back Lake or the Inner Lake, extends from Duanqiao Bridge in the east to Xiling Bridge in the west, Gushan Hill to the south, and Beishan Street to the north.
* Yuehu Lake is located south of Yue Fei&#x27;s Temple, west of the Su Causeway, and south of the Breeze-ruffled Lotus at Winding Garden. Sources from the Republic of China era identify it as lying north of the Inner Lake, separated by the Zhaogong Causeway. This lake is likely named after Yue Fei&#x27;s Tomb, though earlier documentation is unavailable.
* Lesser South Lake lies north of Nanshan Road, west of the Su Causeway, and south of the Viewing Fish at Flowery Pond sight. Republican-era records describe it as situated west of Yinbo Bridge and south of Guanyu Pavilion.

=== Ten scenes ===
Traditionally, there are ten classic scenic spots on the West Lake, each remembered by a four-character epithet. Collectively, they are known as the Ten Scenes of West Lake, of which the rating dates back to the Song dynasty. Each is marked by a stele with an epithet written in the calligraphy of the Qianlong Emperor. The ten scenes include:

== Architecture ==

=== Temples and monasteries ===

Buddhism&#x27;s roots around the West Lake extend back to the 4th century with the establishment of Lingyin Temple and Tianzhu Temple. During the Five Dynasties period (907–960), the Wuyue rulers, who were devoted Buddhists, initiated extensive temple construction in the region. Notable temples from this period include Jingci Temple on Nanping Hill, Yunqi Temple in Fan Village, and Shangtianzhu Temple on Tianzhu Hill. In addition to these temples, pagodas such as Liuhe, Leifeng, and Baochu were erected, along with intricate stone Buddhist carvings in Yanxia Cave, Shiwu Cave, and on Feilaifeng Peak. During the Song Dynasty, Lingyin Temple and Jingci Temple gained recognition as two of the &quot;Five Mountains and Ten Temples.&quot; Across the West Lake Scenic Area, there are 30 Buddhist sites officially designated as protected heritage sites. The Baopu Taoist Monastery, rebuilt in the 17th century, enshrines Ge Hong, a prominent Taoist scholar, alchemist, and medical scientist, who conducted Taoist practices and alchemical experiments on Geling Ridge near the West Lake.

=== Tombs and memorial halls ===

Yue Fei&#x27;s Tomb and Temple serve as a memorial to Yue Fei, a legendary figure in Chinese history known for his loyalty and filial piety. Built in 1163, the tomb honours Yue Fei as a national hero and epitomises the Confucian values that have deeply influenced Chinese society for centuries. Tomb of Su Xiao Xiao is located near the Xiling Bridge on the north bank of the West Lake.

=== Pavilions and monuments ===
Wenlan Pavilion, built in 1784 and rebuilt in 1880, was the only one that exists library among the four libraries commissioned by the Qing imperial family for the collection of &quot;The Complete Library of the Four Treasuries&quot;.

=== Gardens and parks ===

The northeastern shore of the West Lake features Hubin Park, a series of six connected parks along the lakefront, surrounded by upscale shopping centers and hotels. At Park No. 3, visitors can enjoy a musical fountain with free performances every evening. To the northwest, Hangzhou Flower Nursery and Hangzhou Botanical Garden showcase a diverse array of flowers and plants. In the southwest, Taiziwan Park and Huagang Park draw visitors in spring with colorful tulips and seasonal blossoms. On the southeastern shore, Liulangwenying Park and Changqiao Park offer scenic views and spaces for relaxation.

Around the West Lake, several historic private gardens have been preserved. Liu Villa, on the northwest shore, was originally a private Qing-dynasty garden reflecting classic Chinese landscape design. Today, it serves as the West Lake State Guest House, a luxury hotel known for hosting important events and guests. Wang Villa, on the southwestern corner of the West Lake, was also built during the Qing dynasty and has since been restored as part of Xizi Hotel. Jiang Villa, on the eastern shore near the Lakeside area, now operates as the Lakeside Tea House. Guo Villa, located on the northwestern shore at the foot of Solitary Hill near Qixia Ridge, is one of Hangzhou&#x27;s best-preserved Qing-dynasty gardens and is open to the public as a government-run park.

=== Modern architecture ===

The West Lake is home to many Western-style residences constructed during the Republic of China era (1911–1949). On Gushan (Solitary Hill), notable sites include the Memorial Pavilion to Sun Yat-sen, the former residences of Du Yuesheng and Chiang Kai-shek, as well as Yiyunji Lu Villa. Along Beishan Road, significant landmarks feature the Former Residence of Chiang Ching-kuo and various villas such as Run Lu, Ru Lu, Xing Lu, and Baoqing, in addition to notable hotels like Hangzhou Hotel, Xinxin Hotel, and Qiushui Villa. The eastern shore also hosts historic structures including Shihan Jingshe Villa, Long Bridge Villa, Guo Villa, and the former residence of Huang Fu. Modern architecture complements these historical sites, with buildings such as the West Lake Museum and a range of luxury hotels like the Grand Hyatt Hangzhou, upscale shopping centers, such as the Hubin Yintai in77 complex.

== Hydrology ==
With a catchment area spanning 21.22 square kilometers, the lake supports an annual runoff and storage volume of about 14 million cubic meters each. The lake draws around 120 million cubic meters of water annually from the Qiantang River. Natural inflows come from the Jinsha, Longhong, Qishan (also known as Huiyin), and Changqiao streams. The lake&#x27;s water level is maintained at a consistent Yellow Sea reference level of 7.15 meters, fluctuating by only ±0.05 meters. Seasonal water levels range from a high of 7.70 meters to a low of 6.92 meters, with a variation of approximately 50 centimeters. With a storage capacity of about 14.3 million cubic meters, the lake averages 2.27 meters in depth, reaching a maximum of 5 meters and a minimum of less than 1 meter. Average annual precipitation directly over the lake amounts to 5.63 million cubic meters, while the lake&#x27;s water system has a scour coefficient of 1.49. During dry seasons, when the reservoir gate is closed, the flow rate drops to zero, and even during the flood season, it rarely exceeds 0.05 m/s.

Located on the southeastern edge of China&#x27;s hilly regions and the northern boundary of the subtropical zone, West Lake receives an annual solar radiation of 100–110 kcal/cm2 and enjoys 1,800–2,100 sunshine hours per year. Due to Hangzhou&#x27;s mild climate, the West Lake seldom freezes during winter. The last complete freezing of the lake occurred in January 1977, when the city experienced extreme cold, with temperatures plunging to a record low of -8.6 °C. Partial and temporary freezing, however, is observed almost annually, contingent on weather conditions.

== Flora ==
The West Lake is surrounded by rich and varied vegetation. Within the nominated area, there are 1,369 species of spermatophytes from 739 genera in 184 families, including 28 gymnosperm species from 19 genera in 7 families and 1,273 angiosperm species from 675 genera in 150 families. Additionally, there are 68 species of pteridophytes from 45 genera in 27 families.

=== Seasonal flowers ===

The four main seasonal flowers of the West Lake landscape—peach blossoms, lotus flowers, osmanthus, and plum blossoms—are closely connected to Hangzhou&#x27;s cultural heritage such as the Ten Scenes of West Lake. These plants embody the concept of integrating seasonal beauty into the landscape design of these scenic areas.

* Peach trees and willows line the shores and causeways, adding colour to the lake during spring and early summer. On the Su and Bai Causeways, one willow are typically intercropped with one peach, a pattern designed by Su Shi in the 11th century.
* Lotus flowers are grown in 14 designated areas covering around 20 hectares, primarily found in the North Inner Lake and Yuehu Lake.
* Osmanthus trees are widely planted throughout the gardens along the banks of the West Lake, with Manjuelong and the Hangzhou Botanical Garden being the most notable spots for their dense plantings and fragrant blooms in autumn.
* The plum blossom, which represents steadfastness and purity in Chinese culture, are grown in Lingfeng Hill, Gushan Hill, and the Xixi Stream.

=== Longjing tea ===
The Longjing Tea Plantation is nestled in the hills to the west of the West Lake and is renowned for producing Longjing tea, a variety that thrives due to the unique geographical conditions of the area. The tea plants are cultivated on the slopes of these hills, arranged on curved or open terraces near brooks in neatly organised plots. This region benefits from a monsoonal humid climate typical of the northern subtropical zone, characterised by distinct seasons, adequate rainfall, and year-round moisture. The plantation&#x27;s micro-climate, influenced by its location between the Qiantang River to the north and the Jiuxi Streams to the south, creates a foggy and misty environment ideal for tea growth, especially in spring. The surrounding hills, such as Tianzhu Hill and Beigao Peak, protect the area from cold winds, while the valley leading to the Qiantang River draws in humid air, maintaining a warm, wet climate.

=== Ancient trees ===
The area around the West Lake also features numerous ancient and rare trees, many associated with historic temples and monasteries such as Lingyin Temple and Tianzhu Temple, as well as Wushan and Gushan Hills. Among these, 125 trees from 22 species are over 300 years old, serving as living records of the region&#x27;s ecological history.

== Economy ==
According to the Hangzhou Statistical Bureau, in 2017, the West Lake Scenic Area recorded a gross regional product of 112.11 billion yuan (approximately 16.70 billion US dollars). The services sector contributed around 90% of this figure, while manufacturing accounted for roughly 10%, and agriculture contributed less than 0.1%. The GDP per capita for the region was 136,330 yuan (approximately 20,302 US dollars).

=== Tourism ===
Recognised as a National Key Scenic Resort in 1982 and designated a national AAAAA tourist destination in 2006, the West Lake Scenic Area is one of China&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions and a significant cultural landmark. In 2002, the municipal government removed the park walls, allowing free access to most areas around the lake. This made the West Lake the first major tourist destination to eliminate admission fees, with the aim of boosting the sales of nearby restaurants, hotels, and retail stores.

Despite most scenic spots around the lake being free, the non-free scenic spots within the scenic area include Hangzhou Zoo, Hangzhou Botanical Garden, Mulan Mountain Tea Garden, Feilai Peak Scenic Area (with Lingyin Temple inside), Guo Villa, Yue Fei Temple, Yellow Dragon Cave, Liuhe Pagoda Park, Galloping Tiger Park, Bamboo-Lined Path at Yunqi, City God Pavilion, Wansong Academy, Children&#x27;s Park, the Former Residence of Hu Xueyan and the Leifeng Pagoda.

Each year, the scenic area receive more than 30 million visitors. During public holidays, the West Lake is one of the most crowded scenic spots in China. During the 2024 National Day holiday, the area recorded 4.426 million visitors over seven days, representing a 30.92% increase compared to the previous year. Following the free-access policy, the income of the scenic area increased substantially, from 29.4 billion yuan in 2002 to 400.5 billion yuan in 2019. This strategic move contributed to the area&#x27;s economic resilience during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing dependence on admission fees as a primary source of income.

=== Agriculture ===
Historically, the lake needs to strike a balance between aquaculture and irrigation. By the 6th century, the West Lake became an irrigation source, supported by a network of canals aiding rice cultivation. From the 7th century, it provided local residents with fish, aquatic animals (e.g., snails, crabs), and both wild and cultivated plants (e.g., water chestnuts, wild rice shoots), which inspired local cuisine. Absence of intensive management from the government, as seen in the Yuan and Republican era, often led to extensive aquaculture of the lake, while periodic dredging to maintain its irrigation function also temporarily affected habitats and reduced plant food sources. In the 1980s, the annual fish yield peaked at approximately 400 tons but was later reduced to around 250 tons due to regulatory measures aimed at improving water quality.

The Longjing Tea Plantation, situated in the hills west of the West Lake, has been a cornerstone of Chinese tea culture for centuries. Longjing tea, a renowned variety of Chinese green tea, is produced from fresh, non-fermented leaves native to the West Lake area. Before the anti-corruption movement led by Xi Jinping in 2014, Longjing tea was highly valued and often gifted, at times even surpassing the price of gold. In 2019, the core West Lake production area yielded 502.35 tons, generating a revenue of 3.22 billion yuan (approximately 465.57 million US dollars).

=== Gastronomy ===

Hangzhou cuisine, one of the eight traditional cuisines of China, is renowned for its light, mild flavours with a hint of sweetness. Thanks to its geographical location, which provides access to an abundance of seasonal ingredients, Hangzhou cuisine is divided into two main types: lake cuisine and city cuisine. Historically, these types catered to distinguished officials and the broader population, respectively. Lake cuisine emphasises fish, shrimp, and vegetables, while city cuisine uses more commonly available local meats. Signature dishes made from West Lake&#x27;s freshwater fish and lotus root include West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy and Beggar&#x27;s Chicken. However, despite its rich tradition, Hangzhou cuisine faces declining popularity among younger generations. This is attributed to limited options that effectively balance price and taste, earning the city a reputation as a &quot;food desert.&quot;

== Culture ==
=== Garden designs ===

A human-made landscape, the West Lake exemplifies Chinese landscape aesthetics, symbolising harmony between humans and nature as well as the projection of human emotions onto natural scenery. The poetic names create framed views of scenery to be seen from specific locations. The West Lake landscape embodies six key elements inspired by Chinese literature:
* Natural hills and waters;
* A spatial arrangement with hills on three sides and the city on the fourth;
* A layout featuring two causeways and three isles;
* The tradition of poetic names for scenic spots;
* Historic monuments and sites;
* Distinctive flora.
Since the Song dynasty, people imitated the views of the West Lake in their private gardens, borrowing one or more features of the West Lake. Such examples include the Kunming Lake and the West Causeway at the Summer Palace in Beijing, the Lower Lake at the Summer Retreat in Rehe, the poetic place names at the Kyu Shiba Rikyu Garden and Koishikawa Kōrakuen Garden in Tokyo, Japan. Kintaikyo Bridge in Iwakuni, Japan was inspired by bridges over the West Lake of Hangzhou. In 1989, Japan-China Friendship Garden, which involves a miniature replica of the West Lake, was built inside the Gifu Park in Gifu, Japan, in memory of the city&#x27;s friendly tie with Hangzhou since 1979.

=== Fine arts ===
For centuries, the West Lake has also been a prominent theme in East Asian landscape painting, even though many painters may have never seen the lake in person. The State Administration of Cultural Heritage (2011) listed more than 500 paintings and calligraphic works that feature the West Lake since the Tang dynasty (618–907), while Japanese paintings of the lake may even outnumber the existing Chinese depictions. In 1928, the National Academy of Art was founded by the West Lake as the country&#x27;s first higher education institution in art. As a cultural icon of China, it has been featured on Chinese currency, including the one-yuan banknote in the 1979 Bank of China Foreign Exchange Certificate and the 2005 Renminbi, as well as in the Chinese passport.
=== Popular culture ===
The West Lake has deeply influenced Chinese literature, inspiring poets and writers for centuries. Works by poets such as Bai Juyi, Su Shi, Xu Zhimo, and Hu Shih celebrate its historic sites and natural beauty. The Ming essayist Zhang Dai also honoured the lake in his writings, including &quot;Reminiscence and Dream of Tao&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Search for West Lake in Dreams.&quot; In folklore, the West Lake serves as the setting for several popular tales, including &quot;The Legend of the White Snake&quot;, the stories of Ji Gong, and &quot;Butterfly Lovers&quot;.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the West Lake was a prominent theme in popular film music. The Cantonese songwriter Lü Wencheng composed the classic &quot;Autumn Moon Over the Calm Lake&quot; and &quot;Three Ponds Mirroring the Moon&quot; during his 1930s visit, while Tan Peiyun contributed &quot;Listening to Orioles at Willow Waves&quot;. These compositions are now considered staples of Cantonese music. The 1959 violin concerto &quot;Butterfly Lovers&quot;, inspired by the Yue Opera adaptation, remains a celebrated piece in Chinese orchestral repertoire. Between 2004 and 2008, Wang Guoping compiled *The West Lake Series*, which includes the extensive &quot;Collection of Documents about the West Lake&quot; (30 volumes) and &quot;The Complete Library of the West Lake&quot; (50 volumes).

The influence of the West Lake extends to film and performance. The 2005 Hong Kong film &quot;A West Lake Moment&quot;, directed by Yim Ho and Yang Zi. Since 2006, the Hangzhou Art Week has been rebranded as the Spring of West Lake Art Festival. In 2007, director Zhang Yimou launched &quot;Impression West Lake&quot;, a popular and ongoing lakeside performance. Additionally, the West Lake International Documentary Festival, initiated in 2017, has become a significant event in China&#x27;s film scene.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and guide to category theory, the area of study in mathematics that examines in an abstract way the properties of particular mathematical concepts, by formalising them as collections of &quot;objects&quot; and &quot;arrows&quot; (also called morphisms, although this term also has a specific, non category-theoretical sense), where these collections satisfy certain basic conditions. Many significant areas of mathematics can be formalised as categories, and the use of category theory allows many intricate and subtle mathematical results in these fields to be stated, and proved, in a much simpler way than without the use of categories.

<text>The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) is an independent professional association for civil engineers and a charitable body in the United Kingdom. Based in London, ICE has over 92,000 members, of whom three-quarters are located in the UK, while the rest are located in more than 150 other countries. The ICE aims to support the civil engineering profession by offering professional qualification, promoting education, maintaining professional ethics, and liaising with industry, academia and government. Under its commercial arm, it delivers training, recruitment, publishing and contract services. As a professional body, ICE aims to support and promote professional learning (both to students and existing practitioners), managing professional ethics and safeguarding the status of engineers, and representing the interests of the profession in dealings with government, etc. It sets standards for membership of the body; works with industry and academia to progress engineering standards and advises on education and training curricula.

==History==

The late 18th century and early 19th century saw the founding of many learned societies and professional bodies (for example, the Royal Society and the Law Society). Groups calling themselves civil engineers had been meeting for some years from the late 18th century, notably the Society of Civil Engineers formed in 1771 by John Smeaton (renamed the Smeatonian Society after his death). At that time, formal engineering in Britain was limited to the military engineers of the Corps of Royal Engineers, and in the spirit of self-help prevalent at the time and to provide a focus for the fledgling &#x27;civilian engineers&#x27;, the Institution of Civil Engineers was founded as the world&#x27;s first professional engineering body.

The initiative to found the Institution was taken in 1818 by eight young engineers, Henry Robinson Palmer (23), William Maudslay (23), Thomas Maudslay (26), James Jones (28), Charles Collinge (26), John Lethbridge, James Ashwell (19) and Joshua Field (32), who held an inaugural meeting on 2 January 1818, at the Kendal Coffee House in Fleet Street. The institution made little headway until a key step was taken – the appointment of Thomas Telford as the first President of the body. Greatly respected within the profession and blessed with numerous contacts across the industry and in government circles, he was instrumental in drumming up membership and getting a Royal Charter for ICE in 1828. This official recognition helped establish ICE as the pre-eminent organisation for engineers of all disciplines.

Early definitions of a Civil Engineer can be found in the discussions held on 2 January 1818 and in the application for Royal Chartership. In 1818 Palmer said that: 

The objects of such institution, as recited in the charter, and reported in &quot;The Times&quot;, were
After Telford&#x27;s death in 1834, the organisation moved into premises in Great George Street in the heart of Westminster in 1839, and began to publish learned papers on engineering topics. Its members, notably William Cubitt, were also prominent in the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851.

For 29 years ICE provided the forum for engineers practising in all the disciplines recognised today. Mechanical engineer and tool-maker Henry Maudslay was an early member and Joseph Whitworth presented one of the earliest papers – it was not until 1847 that the Institution of Mechanical Engineers was established (with George Stephenson as its first President).

By the end of the 19th century, ICE had introduced examinations for professional engineering qualifications to help ensure and maintain high standards among its members – a role it continues today.

The ICE&#x27;s Great George Street headquarters, designed by James Miller, was built by John Mowlem &amp; Co and completed in 1911.

===Membership and professional qualification===
The institution is a membership organisation comprising 95,460 members worldwide (as of 31 December 2022); around three-quarters are located in the United Kingdom. Membership grades include:
* Student
* Graduate (GMICE)
* Associate (AMICE)
* Technician (MICE)
* Member (MICE)
* Fellow (FICE)

ICE is a licensed body of the Engineering Council and can award the Chartered Engineer (CEng), Incorporated Engineer (IEng) and Engineering Technician (EngTech) professional qualifications. Members who are Chartered Engineers can use the protected title Chartered Civil Engineer.

ICE is also licensed by the Society for the Environment to award the Chartered Environmentalist (CEnv) professional qualification.

===Publishing===
The Institution of Civil Engineers also publishes technical studies covering research and best practice in civil engineering. Under its commercial arm, Thomas Telford Ltd, it delivers training, recruitment, publishing and contract services, such as the NEC Engineering and Construction Contract. All the profits of Thomas Telford Ltd go back to the Institution to further its stated aim of putting civil engineers at the heart of society. The publishing division has existed since 1836 and is today called ICE Publishing. ICE Publishing produces roughly 30 books a year, including the ICE Manuals series, and 30 civil engineering journals, including the ICE Proceedings in nineteen parts, &quot;Géotechnique&quot;, and the &quot;Magazine of Concrete Research&quot;. The ICE Science series is now also published by ICE Publishing. ICE Science currently consists of five journals: &quot;Nanomaterials and Energy&quot;, &quot;Emerging Materials Research&quot;, &quot;Bioinspired, Biomimetic and Nanobiomaterials&quot;, &quot;Green Materials&quot; and &quot;Surface Innovations&quot;.
Nineteen individual parts now make up the Proceedings, as follows:

ICE members, except for students, also receive the &quot;New Civil Engineer&quot; magazine (published weekly from 1995 to 2017 by Emap, now published monthly by Metropolis International).

===Specialist Knowledge Societies===
The ICE also administers 15 Specialist Knowledge Societies created at different times to support special interest groups within the civil engineering industry, some of which are British sections of international and/or European bodies. The societies provide continuing professional development and assist in the transfer of knowledge concerning specialist areas of engineering.

The Specialist Knowledge Societies are:
==Governance==
The institution is governed by the ICE Trustee Board, comprising the President, three Vice Presidents, four members elected from the membership, three ICE Council members, and one nominated member. The President is the public face of the institution and day-to-day management is the responsibility of the Director General.

===President===
The ICE President is elected annually and the holder for 2024–2025 is Jim Hall.

Each year a number of young engineers have been chosen as President&#x27;s apprentices. The scheme was started in 2005 during the presidency of Gordon Masterton, who also initiated a President&#x27;s blog, now the ICE Infrastructure blog. Each incoming President sets out the main theme of his or her year of office in a Presidential Address.

Many of the profession&#x27;s greatest engineers have served as President of the ICE including:

One of Britain&#x27;s greatest engineers, Isambard Kingdom Brunel died before he could take up the post (he was vice-president from 1850).

==Female civil engineers==
The first woman member of ICE was Dorothy Donaldson Buchanan in 1927. The first female Fellows elected were Molly Fergusson (1957), Marie Lindley (1972), Helen Stone (1991) and Joanna Kennedy (1992). In January 2025 30-year-old Costain engineer Georgia Thompson became the youngest woman to be elected a Fellow of the ICE.

The three female Presidents (to date) are Jean Venables, who became the 144th holder of the office in 2008, Rachel Skinner, who became President in 2020, and Anusha Shah, the President in 2023.

In January 1969 the Council of the Institution set up a working party to consider the role of women in engineering. Among its conclusions were that &#x27;while women have certainly established their competence throughout the professional engineering field, there is clearly a built-in or unconscious prejudice against them&#x27;. The WISE Campaign (Women into Science and Engineering) was launched in 1984; by 1992 3% of the total ICE membership of 79,000 was female, and only 0.8% of chartered civil engineers were women. By 2016 women comprised nearly 12% of total membership, almost 7% of chartered civil engineers and just over 2% of Fellows. In June 2015 a Presidential Commission on diversity was announced. By the start of 2023 women made up 16% of overall membership, with female fellows comprising 6% of the fellowship.

==Awards==

The Institution makes various awards to recognise the work of its members. In addition to awards for technical papers, reports and competition entries it awards medals for different achievements.
*Gold Medal – The Gold Medal is awarded to an individual who has made valuable contributions to civil engineering over many years. This may cover contributions in one or more areas, such as, design, research, development, investigation, construction, management (including project management), education and training.
*Garth Watson Medal – The Garth Watson Medal is awarded for dedicated and valuable service to ICE by an ICE Member or member of staff.
*Brunel Medal – The Brunel Medal is awarded to teams, individuals or organisations operating within the built environment and recognises excellence in civil engineering.
*Edmund Hambly Medal – The Edmund Hambly Medal awarded for creative design in an engineering project that makes a substantial contribution to sustainable development. It is awarded to projects, of any scale, which take into account such factors as full life-cycle effects, including de-commissioning, and show an understanding of the implications of infrastructure impact upon the environment. The medal is awarded in honour of past president Edmund Hambly who was a proponent of sustainable engineering.
*International Medal – The International Medal is awarded annually to a civil engineer who has made an outstanding contribution to civil engineering outside the United Kingdom or an engineer who resides outside the United Kingdom.
*Warren Medal – The Warren Medal is awarded annually to an ICE member in recognition of valuable services to his or her region.
*Telford Medal – Telford Medal is the highest prize that can be awarded by the ICE for a paper.
*James Alfred Ewing Medal – The James Alfred Ewing Medal is awarded by the council on the joint nomination of the president and the President of the Royal Society.
*James Forrest Medal – The James Forrest Medal was established in honour of James Forrest upon his retirement as secretary in 1896.
*Baker Medal – The Baker Medal was established in 1934 to recognise papers that promote or cover developments in engineering practice, or investigation into problems with which Sir Benjamin Baker was specially identified.
*Jean Venables Medal – Since 2011, the Institution has awarded a Jean Venables Medal to its best Technician Professional Review candidate.
*President&#x27;s Medal
*Emerging Engineer Award
*James Rennie Medal – For the best Chartered Professional Review candidate of the year. Named after James Rennie, a civil engineer noted for his devotion to the training of new engineers.
*Renée Redfern Hunt Memorial Prize – For the best chartered or member professional review written exercise of the year. Named for an ICE staff member who served as examinations officer from 1945 to 1981.
*Tony Chapman Medal – For the best member professional review candidate of the year. Named after an ICE council member who played a key role in the integration of the Board of Incorporated Engineers and Technicians into the institution and in promoting incorporated engineer status.
*Chris Binnie Award for Sustainable Water Management
*The Bev Waugh Award – Since 2021, for productivity and culture, recognises a leader or individual who has had a positive impact on joint team working
*Adrian Long Medal

<text>Borough Market is a wholesale and retail market hall in Southwark, London, England. It is one of the largest and oldest food markets in London, with a market on the site dating back to at least the 12th century. The present buildings were built in the 1850s, and today the market mainly sells speciality foods to the general public.

==History==
The market itself claims to have existed since 1014 &quot;and probably much earlier&quot; as Snorri Sturluson describes Southwark as a &quot;great market town&quot; when describing an incident in Heimskringla dated to 1014. A market that originally adjoined the end of London Bridge was first mentioned in 1276 and was subsequently moved south of St Margaret&#x27;s church on the High Street. The City of London received a royal charter from Edward VI in 1550 to control all markets in Southwark (see Guildable Manor), which was confirmed by Charles II in 1671. However, the market caused such traffic congestion that, in 1754, it was abolished by an act of Parliament, the (28 Geo. 2. c. 9).
A second act that year, the (28 Geo. 2. c. 23), allowed for the local parishioners to set up another market on a new site, and in 1756, it began again on a 4.5-acre (18,000 m2) site in Rochester Yard. During the 19th century, it became one of London&#x27;s most important food markets due to its strategic position near the riverside wharves of the Pool of London.

By the mid 1990s the market had declined and trustees decided to revive it as a retail rather than a wholesale market. In 1998 they invited Henrietta Green to hold a Food Lovers&#x27; Fair, which recruited several long-term traders for the market. From 1996 they let unused space to wholesale businesses such as Neal&#x27;s Yard Dairy, Brindisa and Monmouth Coffee Company. The new tenants were encouraged to open their premises to retail customers.

In 2011, seven traders were expelled from the market for trading from their storage units at Maltby Street Market a mile away. In turn the traders criticised poor facilities at the market and a move to selling takeaway food.

In the 2017 London Bridge attack, three attackers drove a vehicle over London Bridge and then ran to the area, where they stabbed and killed eight people with knives before they were shot dead by armed police. The market was then closed for 11 days following the attack.

==Information==
Borough Market is located on Southwark Street and Borough High Street just south of Southwark Cathedral on the southern end of London Bridge.

The retail market operates six days per week; it is closed on Mondays.

==Architecture==

The present buildings were designed in 1851 by Henry Rose, with additions in the 1860s and an entrance designed in the Art Deco style added on Southwark Street in 1932. Significant changes to the buildings have been made over the years as a result of successive expansions to the nearby railway infrastructure; see &quot;Railway viaducts and the Thameslink Programme&quot;.

A refurbishment began in 2001. The work includes the re-erection in 2004 of the South Portico from the Floral Hall, previously at Covent Garden, which was dismantled when the Royal Opera House was reconstructed in the 1990s. The original Convent Garden building was listed and the resited portico was Grade II listed in 2008.

== Trade ==
Today market stalls mainly sell specialty foods to the general public. However, in the 20th century Borough Market was essentially a wholesale market, selling produce in quantity to greengrocers. It was the main supplier, along with Covent Garden, of fruits and vegetables to retail greengrocers. Amongst the notable businesses trading in the Borough Market were Vitacress, the Lee Brothers, Manny Sugarman, AW Bourne and Eddy Robbins. JO Sims, the main importer for South African citrus fruit, were also located in the market. Stallholders come to trade at the market from different parts of the UK, and traditional European products are also imported and sold. Amongst the produce on sale are fresh fruit and vegetables, artisanal food, cheese, meat, game, baked bread, and pastry. 

The market is a charitable trusts in English law administered by a board of volunteer trustees, who have to live in the area.

== Film location ==
Borough Market and the surrounding streets have been used as a film location for such features as &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (2001), &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (1998) and &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004). More recently some scenes in &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot; (2009) were shot there. As reported by the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, the market is available to hire for private events.

==Railway viaducts and the Thameslink Programme==

From 1860, the railway operating companies desired to extend services from London Bridge station into new stations at Cannon Street and Blackfriars in the City and link to the West End at Charing Cross Station. This required a viaduct, but legally, it was impossible by the Borough Market Act 1756 for the trustees to alienate their property. The compromise was that only a flying leasehold was given to the railway company for the permanent way, but only for as long as a railway operates on it. The market continues to trade underneath the arches of the viaduct. Each time there is a railway expansion requiring widening of the viaduct, the trustees receive a full compensation payment.

Most recently, as part of the Thameslink Programme, a large number of listed buildings in the Borough Market area have been altered or demolished. The market building on Bedale Street south-side has had its upper floors removed, as has the Wheatsheaf public house on Stoney Street, for the new railway bridge to cross over them. The remaining floors have been re-occupied. The old market glazed roof on Stoney Street has been re-instated and cleaned. A significant loss was the Smirke Terrace, Nos 16–26 Borough High Street, demolished in 2010.

<doc id="354331" wikidata="Q522139" url="?curid=354331" title="Metropolitan Borough of Southwark">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark (&quot;Br&quot; [ˈsʌðɨk]) was a metropolitan borough in the County of London from 1900 to 1965. It was created to cover the western section of the ancient borough of Southwark and the parish of Newington. In common with the rest of inner London, the borough experienced a steady decline in population throughout its existence. The borough council made an unsuccessful attempt to gain city status in 1955. Its former area is now the northwestern part of the current London Borough of Southwark.

==Formation and boundaries==
The borough was formed from four civil parishes: St Mary Newington, Southwark Christchurch, Southwark St George the Martyr and Southwark St Saviour. In 1930 these four were combined into a single civil parish called Southwark, which was conterminous with the metropolitan borough.

Previous to the borough&#x27;s formation it had been administered by three separate local bodies: St Saviours District Board of Works, Newington Vestry and Southwark St George the Martyr Vestry.

The borough was one of two created in the Southwark area by the London Government Act 1899. The remaining, eastern, part of Southwark (the parishes of St John Horsleydown and St Olave &amp; St Thomas) was combined with Bermondsey and Rotherhithe.

The existing boundaries were found to be &quot;very unsatisfactory&quot;. Accordingly, they were realigned, for the most part following the centre of roads. Guy&#x27;s Hospital, which had been divided between three parishes, was entirely taken into the borough.

==History==
===Naming issues===
The legislation did not name the two boroughs. Instead this responsibility was given to the commissioners who were appointed under the act to simplify the boundaries between the new municipalities. Representatives for the various vestries gave their suggestions: St Saviour&#x27;s District Board suggested &quot;Southwark&quot; for the western borough, denying that the eastern borough had a &quot;co-equal&quot; claim to the name. Representatives of the Collegiate Church of St Saviour supported the district board. It was pointed out that a new diocese was soon to be established with the collegiate church becoming the cathedral. This, it was reasoned, would make the new borough the &quot;City of Southwark&quot;.

Newington Vestry believed that the borough should bear their name as they were the &quot;predominant partner&quot; in the merger in terms of population, acreage, rateable value and municipal property, and that the council was likely to be based in their district. The name &quot;Walworth&quot; was also proposed as the area had Roman associations and also appeared in early written histories.

The commissioners originally suggested that &quot;West Southwark&quot; might be acceptable, with the neighbouring borough bearing the name &quot;East Southwark&quot;. The vestry of St John Horsleydown proposed naming the boroughs as &quot;Southwark St Saviour&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Southwark St Olave&#x27;s&quot;, a suggestion supported by the London County Council. A decision was finally made on 25 January 1900, with the western borough becoming &quot;Southwark&quot; and the eastern borough as Bermondsey.

In 1955 the borough council unsuccessfully petitioned for the grant of city status.

==Geography==
It included the areas now known as:

* The Borough
* Bankside
* Elephant and Castle
* Newington
* Walworth

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the borough council were officially granted on 14 June 1902. They included emblems of the four constituent parishes. The red rose represents St Saviour&#x27;s, the white lily Newington, the Southwark Cross commemorates St George (also used by the Bridge House Estates), and the stag&#x27;s head is for the parish of Christchurch. The motto adopted was &#x27;UNITED TO SERVE&#x27;.

==Abolition==
The London Government Act 1963 abolished both the County of London and the metropolitan boroughs. In their place were created Greater London, which was divided into 32 London Boroughs, formed by the merger of existing authorities. On 1 April 1965 the London Borough of Southwark was formed by the amalgamation of the three metropolitan boroughs of Southwark, Camberwell and Bermondsey.

==Population and area==
The borough had an area of . The population from the census was:

Constituent parishes 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961
==Politics==

The borough was divided into ten wards for elections: Christchurch, St George&#x27;s, St John&#x27;s, St Jude&#x27;s, St Mary&#x27;s, St Michael&#x27;s, St Paul&#x27;s, St Peter&#x27;s, St Saviour and Trinity.

===Borough council===

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was divided into three constituencies:
*Newington West
*Southwark West
*Walworth
In 1918 the boundaries of the borough&#x27;s three seats were adjusted and all three were renamed:
*Southwark Central
*Southwark North
*Southwark South East
In 1950 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to one seat:
*Southwark

<text>East Dulwich is an area of South East London, England in the London Borough of Southwark. It forms the eastern part of Dulwich, with Peckham to the east and Camberwell to the north. East Dulwich is home to the Dog Kennel Hill statue. This South London suburb was first developed in the nineteenth century on land owned by the College of God&#x27;s Gift.

It was originally part of the much larger, historic parish of Camberwell, which later became the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell, and included Camberwell, Peckham, Dulwich, Nunhead, and other London districts.

==History==

===Saxon Dulwich===
The earliest record of East Dulwich comes from 967 when Edgar the Peaceful granted Dilwihs to a thane named Earl Aelfheah. Dilwihs meant &quot;meadow where the dill grew&quot;. At the time East Dulwich was likely just a hamlet or group of small farms centered around what is today known as Goose Green.

===Medieval East Dulwich===
In 1066 King William I conquered England, and Dulwich became the property of the new Norman dynasty after taking the land from King Harold II of England, ending the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom. During the Middle Ages many new roads were likely constructed nearby, such as what is today known as Lordship Lane which became the boundary separating Dulwich Manor from Friern Manor, and which was constructed during the reign of King Richard I of England. In 1340 the hamlet of &quot;Est Dilewissh&quot; was sold to John Leverich by William Mabuhs.

===Tudor Dulwich===
In 1538 with the establishment of the Church of England Dulwich was no longer the property of Bermondsey Abbey, which was dissolved in 1537. In 1544 Dulwich was granted to goldsmith Thomas Calton for £609 by Henry VIII making the area no longer property of the crown. Nearby Dulwich, a vast forest known as the Great North Wood, began to be used by local colliers and vast portions of the woodland were cut down in order to build ships.

===Stuart East Dulwich===

During the Stuart era a fresh water spring was found on the edge of Dulwich Wood on the corner of Lordship Lane and College Road. Francis Cox built a Public House which attracted travellers to the well built at the site of the spring. In 1705 Cox constructed a new road, linking his business to the towns of Croydon and Beckenham to the south, today the road is a pathway known as Cox&#x27;s Walk.

===Georgian Dulwich===

In John Rocques’ 1761 map of the cities of London and Westminster, small farms and buildings occupy the modern location of East Dulwich at Goose Green; the modern Grove Vale road is referred to as Dog Kennel Lane. South of Goose Green a settlement referred to as Fryum Farm is present, this probably represents the modern Frein Farm.
In 1805 Dulwich Common was enclosed and in 1826 East Dulwich Chapel was built at the start of Lordship Lane opposite Goose Green.

===Victorian Dulwich===
In 1851 Dulwich&#x27;s population was recorded at 1,632 and in 1863 the London, Chatham and Dover Railway was built. In 1865 St John&#x27;s Church built amidst green fields and in 1868 East Dulwich railway station opened as Champion Hill Station, in the same year Old village green is bought for public use. In 1871 Lordship Lane station was built near modern-day Dulwich Wood.


Between 1871 and 1881 over 5,000 houses were built in East Dulwich as the small hamlet became part of the rapidly expanding London suburbs. The Upper Middle class migrated to the area building &quot;Villas&quot; (large houses with bespoke gardens) nearby, many of which had tennis courts. In 1872 Adys Road School was built of Adys road replacing the St Johns vicaridge and Forest Oak Villa (both of which can be observed on 1860s ordance survey maps). In 1874 St Peter&#x27;s Church was built and in 1877 Emmanuel Congregational Church opened on Barry Road. In 1882 Heber Road School opened and in 1885 horse-drawn trams arrived providing transport into london.

In 1887 Dulwich Hospital opened and in 1890 Dulwich Grove Congregational Church opened on Melbourne Grove.
In the early 1890s Dulwich Park and Peckham Rye Park opened to the public as the area became more urban and densely populated, the old villas disappeared being replaced by smaller houses. In 1892 Dulwich Public Baths opened on East Dulwich Road and in 1893 Dulwich Fire Station opened on Lordship Lane (closed 1947 after war damage). Dulwich Library also opened in the 1890s.

1897 - Dulwich Library opened.
1897 - Enid Blyton was born on Lordship Lane.

===Modern East Dulwich===
It is a residential area which has undergone gentrification in recent years. There is a shopping area along Lordship Lane which, in addition to several independent shops, has a variety of restaurants, butcher, fishmonger. On Saturdays there is a small market on North Cross Road with antiques, crafts and specialist food stalls. Some of the public houses in the area have been converted to gastropubs.

==Geography==
===Dulwich Plough===
One area of East Dulwich is called Dulwich the Plough. This was named after a pub, &quot;The Plough&quot; which had been there since 1830. The pub was taken over by Bass Taverns pub chain and changed its name in 1996 to the &quot;Goose and Granite&quot;. Despite the efforts of a &quot;Save Dulwich Plough&quot; campaign the new name was kept for almost ten years. The name reverted to The Plough in 2005.

Dulwich Library, which opened on 24 November 1897 is nearby.
===549 Lordship Lane: the &quot;Concrete House&quot;===
One of the most architecturally interesting buildings in the area is at 549 Lordship Lane. The so-called &quot;Concrete House&quot; is a former derelict grade II listed building, now restored and back in use, and is an example of 19th-century concrete house. It is believed that it is the only surviving example in England.

The Concrete House was built in 1873 by Charles Drake of the Patent Concrete Building Company. In 1867 the builder had patented the use of iron panels for shuttering rather than timber.

It was on the Heritage at Risk Register from 1994 to 2013 when it was removed following its successful repair and conversion. Having fallen vacant in the 1980s and developing serious structural problems, it has been fully restored and converted to five flats in shared ownership. It then won an award from English Heritage, the Angel Commendation.

==Local government ==

East Dulwich is currently represented by Labour MP Ellie Reeves, who won the newly created seat of Lewisham West and East Dulwich in the 2024 General Election.




==Sport and leisure==
East Dulwich is home to the non-league football club Dulwich Hamlet, who play at Champion Hill.

==Transport==
The area is served by East Dulwich railway station, for Southern train services between London Bridge and local south London destinations.

<doc id="354334" wikidata="Q1304900" url="?curid=354334" title="Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell">
<text>Camberwell was a civil parish and metropolitan borough in south London, England. Camberwell was an ancient parish in the county of Surrey, governed by an administrative vestry from 1674. The parish was included in the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855 and became part of the County of London in 1889. The parish of Camberwell became a metropolitan borough in 1900, following the London Government Act 1899, with the parish vestry replaced by a borough council. In 1965 the borough was abolished and its former area became part of the London Borough of Southwark in Greater London.

==Geography==

The original parish of Camberwell St Giles had three divisions. They were the Liberty of Peckham to the east, the Hamlet of Dulwich to the southwest and the central division of Camberwell proper. The liberty of Peckham stretched from north of Old Kent Road to Honor Oak, taking in Peckham and Nunhead. Camberwell stretched from what is now Burgess Park in the north to what is now the Horniman Museum in the south, taking in the central Camberwell area around Camberwell Green, the eastern part of Herne Hill and East Dulwich. It included a long protrusion in the west, surrounded by Lambeth, as far as what is now Myatt&#x27;s Fields Park. The hamlet of Dulwich stretched from Champion Hill in the north to what is now Crystal Palace in the south, taking in Dulwich Village, West Dulwich and Sydenham Hill.

In 1900 the Camberwell/Lambeth boundary was tidied up with an exchange of population (approximately 6,000 each way) which had the effect of transferring Myatt&#x27;s Fields Park to Lambeth.

== Ecclesiastical parishes ==
The ancient parish, dedicated to St Giles, was in the Diocese of Winchester until 1877, then the Diocese of Rochester until 1905, and then finally in the Diocese of Southwark. From 1825, as the population of Camberwell increased, a number of new parishes were formed:
* St George, Camberwell In 1825 
* Christ Church, Old Kent Road In 1838
* Emmanuel, Camberwell In 1842
* St Mary Magdalene, Peckham In 1842
* Camden Chapel, Camberwell In 1844
* St Matthew, Denmark Hill In 1848
* St Chrysostom, Peckham In 1865
* St John the Evangelist, East Dulwich In 1865
* St Andrew, Peckham In 1866 
* St Peter, Dulwich Common In 1867 
* St Stephen, South Dulwich In 1868
* All Saints, Blenheim Grove, Peckham In 1872
* St James, Knatchbull Road, Camberwell In 1874
* St Antony (formerly St Antholin), Nunhead In 1878 
* St Luke, Rosemary Road, Peckham In 1878
* St Jude, Peckham In 1880
* St Saviour, Denmark Park In 1881
* St Mark, Peckham In 1884
* St Clement, East Dulwich In 1886
* St Batholemew, South Bermondsey In 1887
* All Saints, North Peckham In 1892
* St Barnabas, Dulwich In 1894
* St Silas, Nunhead In 1895 

In addition, as the population of neighbouring areas increased, parts of Camberwell parish were included in new parishes:
* St Paul, Herne Hill In 1845 &quot;with parts of St Mary, Lambeth&quot;
* St Philip, Avondale Square In 1876 &quot;with parts of St Anne, Bermondsey&quot;
* St Mark, Camberwell In 1880 &quot;with parts of All Saints, Newington&quot;

==Coat of arms==

The corporation was granted arms in 1901. The shield depicted the main areas of the borough. In the first and fourth quarter was a well, for Camberwell. The second quarter was for Dulwich: the chevron and cinquefoils from the arms of Edward Alleyn, founder of Alleyn&#x27;s School. The third quarter represented Peckham: the lion was from the arms of Robert, Earl of Gloucester, one time lord of the manor.

The crest depicted a wounded hart, symbol of St Giles, patron saint of Camberwell.

In 1927 the borough was additionally granted an heraldic badge and standard. The badge depicted a Camberwell beauty butterfly.
==Politics==

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the incorporated vestry of St Giles Camberwell was divided into six wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 or St George&#x27;s West (12), No. 2 or St George&#x27;s East (12), No. 3 or Camden (12), No. 4 or North Peckham (15), No. 5 or South Peckham (15) and No. 6 or Camberwell &amp; Dulwich (18).

In 1894 as its population had increased the incorporated vestry was re-divided into eight wards (electing vestrymen): St George&#x27;s West (15), St George&#x27;s East (12), Camden (12), North Peckham (21), South Peckham (21), North Dulwich (15), Central Dulwich (12) and South Dulwich (12).

The metropolitan borough was divided into twenty wards for elections: Addington, Alleyn, Clifton, Coburg, Goldsmith, Lyndhurst, Marlborough, North Peckham, Nunhead, Ruskin, Rye Lane, St George&#x27;s, St Giles, St John&#x27;s, St Mary&#x27;s, The College, The Hamlet, The Rye, The West and Town Hall.

===Borough council===
From 1900 to 1934 the borough was controlled by the Municipal Reform Party (allied to the Conservatives). In 1934 the Labour Party gained control, which they retained until abolition in 1965.

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was divided into three 
constituencies:
*Camberwell, Dulwich
*Camberwell, North
*Camberwell, Peckham

In 1918 the borough&#x27;s representation was increased to four seats:
*Camberwell, Dulwich
*Camberwell, North
*Camberwell, North-West
*Camberwell, Peckham

In 1950 the number of seats was halved to 2:
*Camberwell, Dulwich
*Camberwell, Peckham

==Population and area==

<doc id="354337" wikidata="Q1749030" url="?curid=354337" title="Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey was a Metropolitan borough in the County of London, created in 1900 by the London Government Act 1899. It was abolished and its area became part of the London Borough of Southwark in 1965.

==Formation and boundaries==
The borough was formed from four civil parishes: St Mary Magdalen Bermondsey, St Mary Rotherhithe, Southwark St John Horsleydown and Southwark St Olave and St Thomas. In 1904 these four were combined into a single civil parish called Bermondsey, which was conterminous with the metropolitan borough.

Previous to the borough&#x27;s formation it had been administered by three separate local bodies: St Olave District Board of Works, Bermondsey Vestry and Rotherhithe Vestry.

==History==
The Victorian vestry hall on Spa Road, SE16, was bombed during the Second World War. After the war the neighbouring Municipal Offices (1928, designed by H Tansley) took over the role. Bermondsey Town Hall continued to house civic offices, latterly for Southwark Council, until being sold off in 2012.

The population declined sharply after the Second World War, being cut by about half from 1931 to 1951.

==Coat of arms==
The borough was granted a coat of arms in 1901. The design included references to the three constituent authorities. The lion, crozier and two letters B represent Bermondsey vestry, and are derived from the insignia of Bermondsey Abbey. The crown and axe were the emblem of St Olave&#x27;s District Board of Works, and were derived from the royal arms of Norway, Saint Olave being the anglicised name of King Olaf II of Norway. The ship represented Rotherhithe and the Surrey Commercial Docks. The symbolism in the coat of arms were incorporated into a sculpture called The Bermondsey Lion that was unveiled in The Blue in 2011.

The Latin motto adopted by the borough was &quot;Prosunt gentibus artes&quot; or &quot;Arts profit the people&quot;, and was adapted from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

==Population and area==
The area of the borough was . The population from the Census returns was:

Constituent parishes 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961
==Politics==

The borough was divided into twelve wards for elections: No. 1 Bermondsey, No. 2 Bermondsey, No. 3 Bermondsey, No. 4 Bermondsey, No. 5 Bermondsey, No. 6 Bermondsey, No. 1 Rotherhithe, No. 2 Rotherhithe, No. 3 Rotherhithe, St John, St Olave and St Thomas.

===Borough council===
In the first election to the borough council, held on 1 November 1900 the Moderates (supported by the Conservative party) gained a majority. The opposition group was formed by the Progressive Party. The Moderates retained their majority at the 1903 elections. In 1906 the Moderate group was renamed Municipal Reform. In 1909 The Progressives won 27 seats and the Independent Labour Party 1 to the Municipal Reform&#x27;s 26 seats, but the latter party retained power through the aldermanic elections. They regained an overall majority of councillors at the 1912 elections.

Local elections were postponed during the First World War, with the next poll held in 1919. The results were a major reverse for the Municipal Reform party with just two councillors elected. The Progressives formed the largest party with 27 seats, followed by the Labour Party with 24. There was one independent councillor. At the 1922 elections Labour gained a majority with 38 seats. The opposition was formed by a Ratepayers Association with 14 councillors. Labour held the council at the subsequent elections, holding all the seats from 1934 to 1945 and from 1949 until the borough&#x27;s abolition.

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was divided into two constituencies:
*Bermondsey
*Rotherhithe
In 1918 the boundaries of the borough&#x27;s two seats were adjusted, and one was renamed:
*Bermondsey West
*Rotherhithe
In 1950 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to one seat:
*Bermondsey

<text>Jae-chul Shin (; 20 December 1936 – 9 July 2012) was a Korean martial artist and founder of the World Tang Soo Do Association.

== Biography ==
Jae-chul Shin began his study of martial arts in 1948 joining the Seoul Moo Duk Kwan Central Gym studying under Grandmaster Hwang Kee, the founder of the Korean Moo Duk Kwan system. By the time he was a first dan black belt, he had already started his teaching career as an assistant instructor at the central gym.

Shin would continue to study Tang Soo Do while attending Korea University, where he would earn both his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in political science. While studying at Korea University, Shin began teaching at the university, along at the Seoul Central YMCA, various colleges, and many police and military institutions.

In 1958, Shin was drafted into the South Korean air force as a martial arts instructor. While in the air force he was stationed at Osan Air Base, teaching Tang Soo Do to both American and Korean servicemen. One of those servicemen that Shin taught was an American named Carlos Ray “Chuck” Norris.

By the time he had completed his master&#x27;s degree in 1968, Shin had been instructing students in Tang Soo Do throughout South Korea for almost 20 years. That same year at the request and sponsorship of Chuck Norris, Shin came to the United States to continue graduate studies at Rutgers University and extend his instruction to foreign students as a representative for the Korean Soo Bahk Do Association.

Shin established the U.S. Tang Soo Do Federation in 1968 at his first school in Burlington, New Jersey. In 1982, dissatisfied with the direction that the U.S. Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation was going, Shin resigned from the federation&#x27;s board of directors and along with Ki-yun Yi, Sang-kyu Shim and William D. Clingan founded the World Tang Soo Do Association. Grandmaster Shin&#x27;s decision to leave the Moo Duk Kwan coincided with Kwan Jang Nim Hwang Kee&#x27;s release of the new Soo Bahk Do hyungs which also occurred in 1982.

Shin remained the leader of the World Tang Soo Do Association until his death on 9 July 2012, which is composed of over 150,000 members including more than 40 000 black belts and 300 master instructors in 38 countries. He is the author of several books on Tang Soo Do, and was himself featured as a chapter in the 1971 book, &quot;“20th century Warriors: Prominent Men in the Oriental Fighting Arts&quot;.

In March 2010, the World Tang Soo Do Association&#x27;s board of directors approved Shin&#x27;s promotion to 9th degree black belt. In July 2010, Shin was formally promoted to the rank at the association&#x27;s annual world championships, after 27 years as an 8th degree black belt.

On 9 July 2012, Shin died in his sleep after having health issues in Burlington, NC.

<doc id="354345" wikidata="Q334313" url="?curid=354345" title="Simon Hughes">
<text>Sir Simon Henry Ward Hughes (born 17 May 1951) is a British former politician. He is now the Chancellor of London South Bank University, and a strategic adviser to Talgo, a Spanish manufacturer of trains. Hughes was deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats from 2010 to 2014, and from 2013 until 2015 was Minister of State at the Ministry of Justice. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Bermondsey and Old Southwark (and its predecessors) from 1983 until 2015. He declined a position in the House of Lords in 2015.

Until 2008, he was president of the Liberal Democrats (the party president chairs the Federal Executive board of the party, is the senior elected party official and also represents the party at official functions). Hughes has twice run unsuccessfully for the leadership of the party and was its unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of London in the 2004 election.

He was appointed as a Privy Councillor on 15 December 2010. In December 2013, Hughes was appointed as a Minister of State for Justice and Civil Liberties, and announced he would stand down as Deputy Leader upon the election of a successor. Hughes is also the deputy Chair of Millwall Community Trust Millwall Community Trust and the Rose Theatre Trust, and the Friends of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital Trust. In 2023 Hughes was appointed a Commissioner of the UK Trade and Business Commission. He is also a member of the Church of England Bermondsey and Rotherhithe Deanery Synod.

== Early life and education ==
Hughes was born on 17 May 1951 to James Henry Annesley Hughes and his wife, Sylvia (née Ward). He was privately educated at The Cathedral School, Llandaff, where he was Dean&#x27;s Scholar and Head Boy in 1964; Christ College, Brecon; Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he graduated in law; and the College of Europe in Bruges, where he earned a postgraduate Certificate of Advanced European Studies (equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree). Hughes was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1974. He moved to Camberwell in 1977 and Bermondsey in 1983

==Bermondsey==
Hughes was first elected to Parliament in the Bermondsey by-election of 24 February 1983, in which he defeated Labour candidate and gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell. The by-election was described by &quot;Gay News&quot; as &quot;the dirtiest and most notorious by-election in British political history&quot; because of the slurs against Tatchell&#x27;s character by various opposing campaigners. The Liberal campaign leaflet described the sixteen-candidate election as &quot;a straight choice&quot; between Simon Hughes and the Labour candidate. Hughes won the seat with 57.7% of the vote.

Hughes apologised for the campaign in 2006, during the same few days as revelations of his own homosexual experiences, and confirming that he is bisexual, after being outed by &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper. Hughes told the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme: &quot;I hope that there will never be that sort of campaign again. I have never been comfortable about the whole of that campaign, as Peter knows, and I said that to him in the past ... Where there were things that were inappropriate or wrong, I apologise for that.&quot;

In an apparent attempt to bring the controversy over the 1983 Bermondsey byelection to a close, Peter Tatchell formally endorsed Simon Hughes for Liberal Democrat leader on 25 January 2006, saying: &quot;Simon Hughes is the best of the Lib Dem leadership candidates. If I was a party member, he&#x27;d get my vote. I want to see a stronger lead on social justice and green issues. Despite his recent drift to the centre, Simon is the contender most likely to move the Liberal Democrats in a progressive direction.&quot; In the same statement, Tatchell added: &quot;Since his election, Simon has redeemed himself by voting for gay equality. That&#x27;s all that matters now. He should be judged on his policies, not his private life.&quot;

However, Hughes subsequently chose to abstain from the final vote for gay marriage. Earlier in the debates he voted for the second reading, but also backed what was seen as a &quot;wrecking amendment&quot; and expressed the view that marriage was &quot;traditionally ordained by God as between one man and one woman&quot; and that civil marriage and faith-based marriage should be separated in law.

At the 1983 general election, held a matter of months after the by-election victory, the constituency had been redrawn as Southwark and Bermondsey. By the 1997 election it had been redrawn again, as North Southwark and Bermondsey, with a further change prior to the 2010 election at which the seat was titled Bermondsey and Old Southwark.

The election result in North Southwark and Bermondsey in the 2005 general election was a worse one for Hughes than those he had achieved in previous battles. He held the seat, but the Labour Party saw a 5.9% swing in its favour—the biggest swing to Labour anywhere in the UK. When interviewed on election night television by Jeremy Paxman, Hughes suggested that the fall in his vote might reflect the unpopularity of Southwark Council, which had been controlled by the Liberal Democrats since 2002. In 2010 Hughes won a record majority of 8,530.

Hughes lost the seat in 2015 to Labour&#x27;s Neil Coyle, after being an MP for 32 years. He stood again at the 2017 general election in his former seat, gaining 18,189 votes, but was defeated for the second time by Coyle who polled 31,161 votes, a majority of 12,972. Hughes stood down as a parliamentary candidate in September 2018.

==Political and parliamentary career==
Hughes first joined the Liberal Party in 1971, when he signed up to Cambridge University Liberal Club as a student. As part of the SDP–Liberal Alliance, he was spokesman for the environment from 1983 to 1988. Along with the majority of Liberals, he joined the newly founded Liberal Democrats in 1988, acting as spokesman for education until 1992, then the environment again until 1994, then health until 1997, and then home affairs until 2003. He was the Liberal Democrat candidate in the 2004 Mayor of London elections and came in third with 15.22% of the first preference vote.

In 1986, Hughes—along with two other MPs, Archy Kirkwood and Michael Meadowcroft, and the NLYL and other parts of the party—produced &quot;Across the Divide: Liberal Values on Defence and Disarmament&quot;. This was the rally call that defeated the party leadership in the debate over the issue of an independent nuclear deterrent. Many believe it was Hughes&#x27; speech that won the day for the rebels by 23 votes.

Among other party offices, Hughes was vice-president of the Liberal Democrat Christian Forum. He has also stated that &quot;the present constitutional arrangements for making English decisions are unacceptable and need to be changed.&quot;
He was a member of the centre-left Beveridge Group within the Liberal Democrats.

He was investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards for failing to declare a £10,000 donation from a scrap metals company, Southwark Metals, to his local party. There was no suggestion that Mr Hughes benefited personally from the donation. The commissioner found that none of the breaches of the rules was intentional and that there was no attempt to conceal any donations. Simon Hughes apologised to parliament for his mistakes.

In December 2013, Hughes was appointed as a Minister of State for Justice, following the resignation of Lord McNally who had become Chair of the Youth Justice Board. Hughes announced he would stand down as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats once a successor was elected, following a decision that the Deputy Leader should not hold any office in the coalition government.

===Getting refugee status for Mehdi Kazemi===
Hughes was an important figure in the fight to grant a young gay man, Mehdi Kazemi, asylum so he would not be deported to his homeland of Iran, which had executed his boyfriend, on the basis that it almost certainly would have executed him. Kazemi thanked Hughes in a letter to people across the world who fought to prevent deportation: &quot;I would like to say thank you to my local MP, Mr Simon Hughes, and his team who gave me the chance to live and made a miracle happen when he heard that my life was in serious danger and asked the Home Office to suspend my deportation in December 2006. I would not be here if it hadn’t been for his intervention. He was here for me then and he was here for me again when I was eventually sent back to the UK in April this year. I do not know if I would have been granted my refugee status without him.&quot;

===Leadership election, 2006===

On 12 January 2006, Hughes announced his candidacy in the leadership election triggered by the resignation of Charles Kennedy. He had initially delayed any announcement while carrying out presidential responsibilities in drawing up the timetable for the contest. Speaking to reporters he said: &quot;What I have to offer is my ambition, enthusiasm and passion. ... What I have to offer is my experience over many years in Parliament and campaigning around the country to motivate people to join us.&quot;

After revelation about Hughes&#x27; long-rumoured sexuality, which came four days after Mark Oaten resigned from the Liberal Democrat front bench and gave up on the leadership race, Peter Tatchell confirmed his view that, despite the 1983 Bermondsey incidents: &quot;I hope Simon is elected as party leader because of all the contenders he is the most progressive on human rights, social justice and environmental issues.&quot;

Hughes apologised after his outing by &quot;The Sun&quot;, saying &quot;I gave a reply that wasn&#x27;t untrue but was clearly misleading and I apologise.&quot; He also admitted during the &quot;Question Time&quot; leadership candidate debate on BBC One on 9 February that he hadn&#x27;t handled the matter very well.

Hughes campaigned under a slogan of &quot;Freedom, fairness and sustainability&quot;. His manifesto was also released in PDF format, and was available from his campaign website. Of the three candidates in the contest, he was generally considered the most left wing.

The campaign was marked by a series of hustings around the UK. One was held in Edinburgh, where Hughes stressed his human rights and green-friendly background; another in Manchester. The final hustings was held in London on 23 February 2006.

He said he was proud to have played some part in the success of the Lib Dems across the country.

In the final result, Hughes came third in the ballot of party members with 12,081 votes, behind Campbell and Huhne. In the autumn of 2007, as speculation over Menzies Campbell&#x27;s leadership continued, Simon Hughes publicly criticised him in a GMTV interview, stating that he had to do better.

===Deputy leadership election, 2010===

The 2010 general election, held on 6 May 2010, was the first since 1974 to result in a hung parliament—with the Conservative Party having the most votes and seats, but no party having an overall majority. On 11 May 2010, Labour Party leader and prime minister Gordon Brown announced his resignation, which allowed David Cameron to become Prime Minister, after forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.

Among the Liberal Democrat MPs to be given roles in the cabinet was the deputy party leader Vince Cable, who became Business Secretary and resigned from his role as deputy party leader. Cable&#x27;s resignation as deputy leader caused a deputy leadership election, with Hughes defeating Tim Farron by 38 votes to 18.

==Personal life==
Outside politics, Hughes is a supporter of Millwall Football Club.

Hughes has never married, although in an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2006, he said he had been turned down by &quot;several women&quot;. He denied persistent rumours about his sexuality, when asked if he was gay, saying &quot;The answer is no, as it happens, but if it were the case, which it isn&#x27;t, I hope that it would not be an issue.&quot; Two days later, in an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; he again denied being gay, and later in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; he repeated the denial.

However, on 26 January 2006, after &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper told him that they had proof that he had used a gay chat service known as &#x27;Man Talk&#x27;, Hughes admitted that in the past he had had relationships with both women and men.

Referring to his change from previous denials about his sexuality and recent Liberal Democrat difficulties he said, &quot;I hope that any colleague in any party at any time who might not have been entirely honest for good reason or who may have made a mistake is accepted back at the right time&quot;, and also &quot;I gave a reply that wasn&#x27;t untrue but was clearly misleading. I apologise.&quot; He confirmed to &quot;PinkNews&quot; that he is bisexual.

In an interview broadcast on the same day on BBC Radio 5 Live, when asked if he considered quitting the race for leadership of his party, he replied: &quot;Of course. I considered also whether I should stand in the first place. It is a balance I have always had to take.&quot;

He once appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

==Honours==
On 13 May 2010 Hughes was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council. This gave him the Honorific Prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for Life. In the 2015 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List, Hughes was knighted &quot;for public and political service&quot;. This allowed him to be known as &quot;Sir Simon Hughes&quot;.

<text>Edo de Waart (born 1 June 1941, Amsterdam) is a Dutch retired conductor. He is Music Director Laureate of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. De Waart is the former music director of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra (2016-2019), chief conductor of the Royal Flemish Philharmonic (2011-2016) and Artistic Partner with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra (2010-2014).

De Waart studied oboe, piano and conducting at the Sweelinck Conservatory, graduating in 1962. The following year, he was appointed associate principal oboe of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.

==Professional career==
===Orchestral conducting===
In 1964, at the age of 23, De Waart won the Dimitris Mitropoulos Conducting Competition in New York. As part of his prize, he served for one year as assistant conductor to Leonard Bernstein at the New York Philharmonic. On his return to the Netherlands, he was appointed assistant conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra under Bernard Haitink.

In 1967, he was appointed conductor of both the Netherlands Wind Ensemble and Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, and was the latter&#x27;s music director from 1973 to 1979.

De Waart made his début at the San Francisco Symphony in 1975. A year later, he became principal guest conductor, and from 1977 to 1985 he was its music director. From 1986 to 1995, he was music director of the Minnesota Orchestra.

In 1989, De Waart returned to the Netherlands, where he was appointed music director of the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic. He resigned from the post in 2004 and subsequently took the title of conductor laureate of the orchestra. 

De Waart became chief conductor and artistic adviser of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 1993, and served in the post until 2003. While in Sydney, De Waart made no secret of his dislike of the acoustics of the Sydney Opera House Concert Hall, the orchestra&#x27;s home, saying, &quot;if there is no clear intention to do something to improve the hall, then we really seriously have to look at another venue&quot;. In 2004, De Waart became artistic director and chief conductor of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra. He concluded his Hong Kong tenure in 2012.

In January 2008, De Waart was named music director of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, and he assumed the post in September 2009. In March 2008, the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra announced De Waart as an Artistic Partner with the orchestra for the 2010–11 season. In April 2010, the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra announced the extension of De Waart&#x27;s contract through the 2016–17 season. In the same month, the Royal Flemish Philharmonic (deFilharmonie) announced De Waart&#x27;s appointment as chief conductor for six seasons beginning in 2012. He formally began his chief conductorship of deFilharmonie (now: Antwerp Symphony Orchestra) in 2011, a year earlier than originally scheduled. In November 2014, deFilharmonie announced that De Waart&#x27;s tenure as chief conductor would conclude after the 2015–2016 season. In February 2015, the Milwaukee Symphony announced the conclusion of De Waart&#x27;s music directorship after the 2016–2017 season. He now has the title of conductor laureate of the Milwaukee Symphony.

In June 2015, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra announced the appointment of De Waart as its next music director. He led his first concerts as NZSO music director in March 2016. He conducted his final concerts as NZSO music director in November 2019, and took the title of music director laureate in 2020.

In January 2015, De Waart first guest-conducted the San Diego Symphony. In January 2019, the orchestra announced the appointment of De Waart as its first-ever principal guest conductor, effective with the 2019–2020 season.

On 10 April 2024, De Waart announced his retirement. 

===Opera===
De Waart was a frequent conductor of opera, making his first appearance at the Santa Fe Opera in 1971, in a production of &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;. He debuted at the Houston Grand Opera in 1975, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1976, and the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in 1979. From 1970, he conducted Netherlands Opera (DNO) frequently. In 1980, he directed a &quot;Ring&quot; cycle at the San Francisco Opera.

In March 2002, De Waart announced his departure in 2004 as chief conductor of the DNO, a position he had occupied since 1999. In giving his reason for leaving, De Waart mentioned his desire to spend time with his two small children. But in an interview with the newspaper &quot;Trouw&quot; he also mentioned his disagreement with DNO director Pierre Audi&#x27;s conceptual staging of &quot;Lohengrin &quot;and Robert Wilson&#x27;s planned &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, saying he missed &quot;humanity&quot; and &quot;emotion in the direction.&quot;

In July 2007, Santa Fe Opera named De Waart their chief conductor, effective 1 October 2007. His initial contract was for four years, during which time he conducted the 2008 production of &quot;Billy Budd&quot;. However, in November 2008, Santa Fe Opera announced De Waart&#x27;s resignation, to occur before the end of his contract, no earlier than the end of the 2009 season. De Waart cited health and family reasons for this decision.

===Repertoire===
An avid promoter of contemporary music, De Waart led premieres of works by John Adams, whose opera &quot;Nixon in China&quot; he has recorded; Steve Reich, whose &quot;Variations for Winds, Strings and Keyboards&quot; he has recorded; and others in San Francisco. Ellen Taaffe Zwilich&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 is dedicated to him.

==Recordings==
De Waart&#x27;s recording catalog is extensive, encompassing recordings with such labels as Philips and orchestras such as the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, Netherlands Radio Philharmonic, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Minnesota Orchestra, and San Francisco Symphony.

===Selected discography===

==Honours==

He is a knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion.

==Personal life==
De Waart and his sixth wife, Rebecca Dopp, live in Maple Bluff, Wisconsin, near Dopp&#x27;s hometown of Middleton. They married in 1999 and have two children: a son, Sebastiaan, and a daughter, Olivia. The family previously lived in Hong Kong but moved to accommodate Sebastiaan&#x27;s asthma. De Waart and his first wife, Noor Terweij, had two children, Boris and Marjolein. He was also formerly married to Roberta Alexander, Sheri Greenawald, Katherine Hilst, and Ruth Welting.

<text>Capital London is an Independent Local Radio station owned and operated by Global Media &amp; Entertainment as part of its national Capital Network. 

As Capital Radio it was launched in the London area in 1973 as one of Britain&#x27;s first two commercial radio stations. Its brief was to entertain, while its opposite number, London Broadcasting (LBC), was licensed to provide news and information. In search of a larger audience in 1974, Capital Radio rapidly moved from a general and entertainment station with drama, features, documentaries and light music to a more successful pop music-based format.

In 1988 it became two stations: 95.8 Capital FM and Capital Gold. After some national expansion with the purchase of other radio stations the Capital Radio Group merged with GWR Group in 2005 to form GCap Media which in turn was taken over by Global Radio in 2008. In 2011, Capital was launched nationally, apart from the daily breakfast and weekday drivetime shows, becoming part of the Capital FM Network. In 2019, the breakfast show also became national, with 11 regional drivetime shows.

==History==
===Pre-launch ===
The Sound Broadcasting Act 1972 allowed for the establishment of local commercial radio stations in the United Kingdom to operate alongside the national radio stations provided by the BBC.

In October 1972 the Independent Broadcasting Authority invited applications for two local radio licences in London: one for a general and entertainment station, the other for news and information.

The licence for the entertainment service saw eight organisations applying, many of them with established entertainment pedigrees. Associated Television, run by Lew Grade, was one of them, as was the long-established Isle of Man broadcaster Manx Radio. Others were specially formed companies: Piccadilly Radio under the leadership of the film producer Lord Brabourne, Network Broadcasting headed by the writer Lord Willis and the broadcaster Ned Sherrin, the actor and comedian Bernard Braden’s London Radio Independent Broadcasters and London Independent Broadcasting which included the impresario Robert Stigwood, the then radio producer John Whitney, the record and electronics company EMI, and Mecca Leisure Group. The theatre director Peter Hall (director) supported Artists in Radio.

The successful franchisee, however, was Capital Radio Limited. This company, with shareholders including Rediffusion Radio Holdings Limited, Local News of London Limited and The Observer (Holdings) Limited was headed as chairman by the actor and film director Richard Attenborough. Other board members at that time included record producer George Martin, actor and film director Bryan Forbes, theatrical producer Peter Saunders, and a millionaire dentist and long-time commercial radio enthusiast Barclay Barclay-White. By the time of Capital Radio’s launch in October 1973 some of the competitors for the licence such as Lord Willis and John Whitney had joined the board.

Test transmissions by the IBA commenced in January 1973 using the VHF frequency 95.8 MHz for FM from the Croydon transmitter and the MW frequency 557 kHz (539 m) for AM from London Transport&#x27;s Lots Road Power Station, Chelsea. The location of the medium-wave transmitter and the frequency used were only temporary until a new high-powered medium-wave station at Saffron Green, Barnet, was completed.

In the meantime Capital Radio set about obtaining premises from which to broadcast and employing staff and on-air personnel, setting up temporary headquarters at 96 Piccadilly in London&#x27;s Mayfair. Michael Bukht was appointed programme controller, Aidan Day Head of Music and Ron Onions Head of News, while Gerry O&#x27;Reilly was appointed Chief Engineer.

=== Launch===
On 16 October 1973 Capital commenced regular transmissions with the British national anthem &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, then a message from director Richard Attenborough &quot;...Good morning, this, for the very first time, is Capital Radio&quot; followed by the Capital Radio theme jingle, made by Blue Mink:

:&quot;Isn&#x27;t it good to know,
:Capital Radio
:You can turn on the friend, you can turn on the show,
:you can turn on the world with Capital Radio
:Such a good way to make your day
:Capital sounds go round and round,
:London town, up and down.
:The brightest sound in London town
:Capital Radio in tune with London (yeah)&quot;... 
Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s song &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; followed the jingle. The first radio commercial came from Birds Eye fish fingers, which was also the first ever legal radio commercial on LBC.

Capital&#x27;s programming remit, as with all ILR stations at the time, was to appeal to the broadest range of people as possible, which included specialist music programmes, radio plays, classical music, community features and news documentaries. The host of Capital&#x27;s first show was former BBC Light Programme and former BBC Radio 1 presenter David Symonds. After Symonds moved to the Capital Countdown show, he was replaced at breakfast by the former Radio London partnership of Kenny Everett and Dave Cash (known for &quot;The Kenny &amp; Cash Show&quot;).

Immediately after going on air, Capital Radio suffered co-channel interference from Radio Veronica, a pirate radio station off the coast of the Netherlands. Veronica began broadcasting in the 1960s and it was suggested that the allocation of 539 metres to ILR may have been an attempt to block reception of overseas broadcasts – a battle which preceded the launch of BBC Radio 1. Capital finally moved into office blocks in Euston Tower in September 1973, just a few yards away from Thames Television headquarters. Euston Tower was, at the time, London&#x27;s tallest office tower.

In 1975, the IBA opened the transmission facilities at Saffron Green which allowed both LBC and Capital Radio to move up the dial. Capital moved to 1548 kHz mediumwave (194 m) and LBC to 1152 kHz (261 m). Saffron Green needed to be highly configured as it was sharing the same frequency as other ILR stations and needed to prevent co-channel interference from new ILR stations in Birmingham and Manchester. Previously the aerial wire suspended between the towers of Lots Road site gained Capital and LBC the semi-humorous nickname of &quot;Radio Clothesline&quot; however both stations could be heard as far away as the Midlands. FM reception remained unaltered.

===Capital in danger (1974–5)===
Capital continued broadcasting, having been a 24-hour station from the beginning. The so-called &#x27;needle-time&#x27; restrictions on playing recorded music were eased, which meant it could play more of it, although they were not abolished entirely until 1988.

==== Charities and the Flying Eye ====

The mid-1970s saw Capital Radio expand with the launch of the Help a London Child charity, which aimed to raise money for London&#x27;s poorest children. The charity appeal went on to become one of the longest-running in broadcasting and the most recognised in British radio. In recognition of this, Network Southeast named British Rail Class 47 47710 &quot;Capital Radio&#x27;s Help a London Child&quot;, in August 1991. In 1976, Capital Radio, Thames Television, London Weekend Television and British Telecom launched the Capital Radio Helpline which helped listeners through matters ranging from how to cook a turkey at Christmas time to suicide prevention. In this era the station also lent its support to London-based orchestras, choral societies, the British Film Institute Children&#x27;s Film Festival and many other ventures.

1976 saw the launch of the Flying Eye, a traffic-spotting light aircraft, which could see traffic congestion below on the streets of Central London. LBC also had a similar service but was forced to suspend operations due to cost. Capital&#x27;s aircraft was originally a Piper Seneca model, and, later, a twin-engined Grumman Cougar.

=== Music Power (1980s) ===

Charlie Gillett had his world music programme &quot;The World of Difference&quot; on Sunday evenings. Several of Capital&#x27;s early presenters had moved on, to be replaced by newer disc jockeys, some of whom had experience presenting on Radio Luxembourg. Although it would only broadcast for three years, the Mike Allen hip hop show was influential during this time to bring the new music culture to the UK.

In 1987, a new programme controller Richard Park, oversaw an overhaul of Capital&#x27;s output from a full-service station to a music-intensive CHR format, which proved highly successful. The revamp was underlined by a new on-air imaging package, known as &#x27;Music Power&#x27;.

===One becomes two: the frequency split (1986–96)===

As part of an IBA experiment in split broadcasting on Independent Local Radio, in 1986, Capital runs a Sunday daytime service called CFM, broadcasting a more contemporary mix of music than normally broadcast by the station. This was precursor to the Broadcasting Act 1990 which required all ILR stations to permanently split simulcasting output on both its AM and FM frequencies in order to create new local radio stations and improve choice. Capital responded in 1988 by launching a golden oldies station called Capital Gold, initially at the weekend prior to going full time on 1 November, on its AM frequency while Capital on FM became 95.8 Capital FM, a chart contemporary music station. Both stations received brand-new jingle packages from Californian jingle house &quot;Who Did That Music&quot; (later Groove Addicts, now GrooveWorx), that went on to become well known and essential parts of its music programming.

===1997–2010===
From 1997, the studios of 95.8 Capital FM have been based in Leicester Square, which is also home to Capital&#x27;s parent company, Global. The studio complex is shared with many other stations, including Heart, Smooth Radio, Classic FM, Capital XTRA, Radio X, LBC and Gold.

The station launched its website in September 1996 resulting in high demand which led to it crashing within a few hours.

Beginning in late 2005, the station went through a number of changes. In December 2005, Chris Brooks moved from weekend breakfast to host 1–4 in the afternoon and Richard Bacon presenting The Go Home Show between 4–7. A new policy started of two advertisements in each break to win favour with listeners, though there were more frequent breaks as a result. This policy was changed within a few months.
On 9 January 2006, the station was relaunched under its original name &quot;Capital Radio&quot;, with a modified line-up of presenters and a slightly tweaked music format. After this re-launch turned out not to have had the desired success, a new Programme Controller was appointed that September. Scott Muller came from the Nova group in Australia, and the station saw another tweak in style.

The changes continued seeing Capital re-branded back to &quot;London&#x27;s Hit Music Station&quot;, a play on the station&#x27;s earlier brand of &quot;London&#x27;s Number One Hit Music Station&quot; with noticeable improvements – leading to a rise in audience figures at the end of 2006. The station also changed its on-air name to &quot;95.8 Capital Radio&quot;, incorporating the frequency of &quot;95.8&quot; back into the station since it was dropped at the January 2006 re-launch.

In March 2007, the station was then renamed &quot;Capital 95.8&quot; and its slogan became &quot;The Sound of London&quot;. The marketing campaign combined outdoor, cinema, and print adverts.

RAJAR figures for Q2 2007 showed Capital 95.8 slipping to fourth place in the London local radio market ratings, recording the lowest-ever share of the London audience and for the first time falling behind Emap-owned station Magic and Heart, now owned by Global. Capital 95.8&#x27;s audience share slipped from 4.6 to 4.1 per cent over the quarter.

The station then returned to the &quot;London&#x27;s Hit Music Network&quot; tagline on 10 December 2007, with ex-Absolute Radio presenter Greg Burns replacing Lucio on drivetime, and Lucio moving to the evening show. Lucio took over from Bam Bam (Peter Poulton) who left Capital in early December 2007. On 6 June 2008, Global completed its £375 million takeover of Capital&#x27;s owner GCap Media.

===2011–present===
On 3 January 2011, the Capital brand began to be rolled out across the UK when Capital London became a founder member of a nine-station Capital network as part of a merger of the Global owned Hit Music and Galaxy networks and with the exception of weekday breakfast and drivetime plus weekend mornings, all output was simulcast with the rest of the network.

On 12 May 2011 it was announced that 95.8 Capital remained the most-listened-to commercial radio station in London, on both share and reach, beating rival Magic 105.4. However, on 4 August that year it was announced that rival Magic 105.4 had overtaken the position.

As of April 2019, only one programme - weekday drivetime - remains local, with all other programming coming from the national Capital network.

<doc id="354354" wikidata="Q207734" url="?curid=354354" title="Renault FT">
<text>The Renault FT (frequently referred to in post-World War I literature as the FT-17, FT17, or similar) is a French light tank that was among the most revolutionary and influential tank designs in history. The FT was the first production tank to have its armament within a fully rotating turret. The Renault FT&#x27;s configuration (crew compartment at the front, engine compartment at the back, and main armament in a revolving turret) became and remains the standard tank layout. Consequently, some armoured warfare historians have called the Renault FT the world&#x27;s first modern tank.

Over 3,000 Renault FT tanks were manufactured by France, most of them in 1918. After World War I, FT tanks were exported in large numbers. Copies and derivative designs were manufactured in the United States (M1917 light tank), in Italy (Fiat 3000), and in the Soviet Union (T-18 tank). The Renault FT saw combat during the interwar conflicts around the world but was considered obsolete at the outbreak of World War II.

== Development ==

The FT was designed and produced by the Société des Automobiles Renault (Renault Automobile Company).
It is thought possible that Louis Renault began working on the idea as early as 21 December 1915, after a visit from Colonel J. B. E. Estienne. Estienne had drawn up plans for a tracked armoured vehicle based on the Holt caterpillar tractor, and with permission from General Joffre, approached Renault as a possible manufacturer. Renault declined, saying that his company was operating at full capacity producing war materiel and that he had no experience of tracked vehicles. Estienne later discovered that the Schneider company was working on a tracked armoured vehicle, which became France&#x27;s first operational tank, the Schneider CA.

At a later, chance meeting with Renault on 16 July 1916, Estienne asked him to reconsider, which he did, favourably.
Louis Renault himself conceived the new tank&#x27;s overall design and set its basic specifications. He imposed a 7-ton limit to the FT&#x27;s projected weight. Renault was unconvinced that a sufficient power-to-weight ratio could be achieved with the production engines available at the time to give sufficient mobility to the heavy tank types requested by the military. Renault&#x27;s industrial designer Rodolphe Ernst-Metzmaier generated the FT&#x27;s execution plans. Charles-Edmond Serre, a long-time associate of Louis Renault, organized and supervised the new tank&#x27;s mass production. The FT&#x27;s tracks were kept automatically under tension to prevent derailments, while a rounded tailpiece facilitated the crossing of trenches. Because the engine had been designed to function normally under any slant, very steep slopes could be negotiated by the Renault FT without loss of power. Effective internal ventilation was provided by the engine&#x27;s radiator fan, which drew its air through the front crew compartment of the tank and forced it out through the rear engine&#x27;s compartment.

Renault encountered some early difficulties in getting his proposal fully supported by Estienne. After the first British use of heavy tanks on 15 September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme, the French military still pondered whether a large number of light tanks would be preferable to a smaller number of super-heavy tanks (the later Char 2C). On 27 November 1916, Estienne sent to the French Commander in Chief a personal memorandum proposing the immediate adoption and mass manufacture of a light tank based on the specifications of the Renault prototype. After receiving two large government orders for the FT tank, one in April 1917 and the other in June 1917, Renault was able to proceed. His design remained in competition with the super-heavy Char 2C until the end of the war.

The prototype was refined during the second half of 1917, but the Renault FT remained plagued by radiator fan belt problems throughout the war. Only 84 were produced in 1917, but 2,697 were delivered to the French army before the Armistice.

=== Naming ===
Although it has sometimes been stated that the letters FT stand for the French terms &quot;faible tonnage&quot; (low tonnage), &quot;faible taille&quot; (small size), &quot;franchisseur de tranchées&quot; (trench crosser), or &quot;force terrestre&quot; (land force), none of these names are correct. Neither was it named the FT 17 or FT-17. The name is derived from the two-letter production code that all new Renault projects were given for internal use: the one available was &#x27;FT&#x27;.

The prototype was at first referred to as the &quot;automitrailleuse à chenilles Renault FT modèle 1917&quot;. &quot;Automitrailleuse à chenilles&quot; means &quot;armoured car [lit: motorized machine gun] with tracks.&quot; By this stage of the war, &quot;automitrailleuse&quot; was the standard word for an armoured car, but by the time the FT was designed there were two other types of French tank in existence, and the term &quot;char d&#x27;assaut&quot; (from the French &quot;char&quot; – a cart or wagon, and &quot;assaut&quot;; attack or assault), soon shortened to &quot;char&quot;, had at the insistence of Colonel Estienne, already been adopted by the French and was in common use. Once orders for the vehicle had been secured it was the practice at Renault to refer to it as the &quot;FT&quot;. The vehicle was originally intended to carry a machine-gun, and was therefore described as a &quot;char mitrailleur&quot; – &quot;mitrailleur&quot; (from &quot;mitraille&quot;; grapeshot) had by this time come to mean &quot;machine-gunner&quot;.

Many sources, predominantly English language accounts, refer to the FT as the &quot;FT 17&quot; or &quot;FT-17.&quot; This term is not contemporary and appears to have arisen post World War One. In Estienne&#x27;s biography, his granddaughter states, &quot;It is also referred to as the FT 17: the number 17 was added after the war in history books, since it was always referred to at Renault as the FT.&quot; Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Malmassari (French tank officer and Doctor of History) states, &quot;The Renault tank never carried the name FT 17 during the First World War, although the initials F.T. seem to appear in August 1917.&quot; Some confusion might also have been caused by the fact that the American version of the vehicle, produced in the US under licence from Renault, was designated the M1917. When it was decided to equip the FTs with either cannon or machine-guns, the cannon version was designated &quot;char canon&quot; (cannon tank), and the latter, in accordance with French grammar, renamed &quot;char mitrailleuse&quot; (machine-gun tank).

It is frequently claimed that some of these tanks were designated FT 18. Reasons given for the claim include: it distinguished tanks produced in 1918 from those of 1917; it was applied to FTs armed with cannon as opposed to those with machine-guns; it distinguished FTs with a cast, rounded turret from those with a hexagonal one; it referred to the 18 horsepower engine; it indicated a version to which various modifications had been made.

Renault records make no distinction between 1917 and 1918 output; the decision to arm FTs with a 37mm gun was made in April 1917, before any tanks had been manufactured; because of various production difficulties and design requirements, a range of turret types were produced by several manufacturers, but they were all fitted to the basic FT body without any distinguishing reference; all FTs had the same model 18 hp engine. The Renault manual of April 1918 is entitled &quot;RENAULT CHAR D&#x27;ASSAUT 18 HP&quot;, and the illustrations are of the machine-gun version. The official designation was not changed until the 1930s when the FT was fitted with a 1931 Reibel machine gun and renamed the &quot;FT modifié 31&quot;. By this time, the French Army was equipped with several other Renault models and it had become necessary to distinguish between the various types.

== Production ==

=== France ===

About half of all FTs were manufactured in Renault&#x27;s factory at Boulogne-Billancourt near Paris, with the remainder subcontracted to other companies. Of the original order for 3,530, Renault accounted for 1,850 (52%), Berliet 800 (23%), SOMUA (a subsidiary of Schneider &amp; Cie) 600 (17%), and Delaunay-Belleville 280 (8%). When the order was increased to 7,820 in 1918, production was distributed in roughly the same proportion. Louis Renault agreed to waive royalties for all French manufacturers of the FT.
=== United States ===

When the US entered the war in April 1917, its army was short of heavy materiel and had no tanks at all. Because of the wartime demands on French industry, it was decided that the quickest way to supply the American forces with sufficient armour was to manufacture the FT in the US. A requirement of 4,400 of a modified version, the M1917, was decided on, with delivery expected to begin in April 1918. By June 1918, US manufacturers had failed to produce any, and delivery dates were put back until September. France therefore agreed to lend 144 FTs, enough to equip two battalions. No M1917s reached the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) until the war was over.

== Turret ==
The first turret designed for the FT was a circular, cast steel version almost identical to that of the prototype. It was designed to carry a Hotchkiss 8mm machine gun. In April 1917 Estienne decided for tactical reasons that some vehicles should be capable of carrying a small cannon. The 37mm Puteaux gun was chosen, and attempts were made to produce a cast steel turret capable of accommodating it, but they were unsuccessful. The first 150 FTs were for training only, and made of non-hardened steel plus the first model of turret. Meanwhile, the Berliet Company had produced a new design, a polygonal turret of riveted plate, which was simpler to produce than the early cast steel turret. It was given the name &quot;omnibus&quot;, since it could easily be adapted to mount either the Hotchkiss machine gun or the Puteaux 37mm with its telescopic sight. This turret was fitted to production models in large numbers. In 1918 &quot;Forges et aciéries Paul Girod&quot; produced a successful circular turret which was mostly cast with some rolled parts. The Girod turret was also an &quot;omnibus&quot; design. Girod supplied it to all the companies producing the FT, and in the later stages of the war it became more commonplace than the Berliet turret. The turret sat on a circular ball-bearing race, and could easily be rotated by the gunner/commander or be locked in position with a handbrake.

== Service history ==

=== World War I ===
The Renault FT was widely used by French forces in 1918 and by the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front in the closing stages of World War I.

Its battlefield debut occurred on 31 May 1918, east of the Forest of Retz, east of Chaudun, between Ploisy and Chazelles, during the Third Battle of the Aisne. This engagement, with 30 tanks, successfully broke up a German advance, but in the absence of infantry support, the vehicles later withdrew. From then on, gradually increasing numbers of FTs were deployed, together with smaller numbers of the older Schneider CA1 and Saint-Chamond tanks. As the war had become a war of movement during mid-1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive, the lighter FTs were often transported on heavy trucks and special trailers rather than by rail on flat cars. Estienne had initially proposed to overwhelm the enemy defences using a &quot;swarm&quot; of light tanks, a tactic that was eventually successfully implemented. Beginning in late 1917, the Entente allies were attempting to outproduce the Central Powers in all respects, including artillery, tanks, and chemical weapons. Consequently, a goal was set of manufacturing 12,260 FT tanks (7,820 in France and 4,440 in the United States) before the end of 1919. It played a leading role in the offensives of 1918, when it received the popular name &quot;Victory Tank&quot;.

The British Army used 24 FTs for command and liaison duties, usually with the gun removed.

Italy received 3 FTs in June 1918, but they did not see action and no other tanks were received until the end of the war.

=== Interwar period ===
After the end of World War I, Renault FTs were exported to many countries (Belgium, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Finland, Iran, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, and Yugoslavia). Renault FT tanks were used by most nations having armoured forces, generally as their prominent tank type.

They were used in anti-Soviet conflicts such as the Russian Civil War and Polish-Soviet War. On 5 February 1920, Estonia purchased nine vehicles from France.
French tanks deployed in Vladivostok were given to the Chinese Fengtian Army of Zhang Zuolin in 1919. 14 more Renaults were bought in 1924 and 1925. These tanks saw action to protect the border from the Soviets in the 1920s and against the warlord Wu Peifu in 1926. After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, nearly all were handed over to the Manchukuo Imperial Army.

Renault tanks were also used in colonial conflicts, for instance crushing a revolt in Italian Libya in 1919. The French Army sent a company of FT tanks to Syria during the Great Druze Revolt. In Brazil, the FT tanks were used by the Old Republic to crush various revolts between 1924 and 1927 and by Vargas forces against the Constitutionalist Revolution.

During the Rif War, after the Battle of Annual, the Spanish Army ordered 10 FT armed with Hotchkiss machine guns and 1 &quot;char TSF&quot; to supplement a first Renault bought in 1919. These tanks formed a company deployed from 1921. After a first failure, they proved to be very effective and six more were delivered in 1925. The Spanish FT were the first tanks in history to take part in an amphibious assault, the Alhucemas landing. The French Army deployed two battalions of FT during the war, including one company of tanks with Kégresse tracks. After the end of the war, the French tanks remained in North Africa to finish the &quot;pacification&quot; of Morocco in the Atlas Mountains. When the Spanish Civil War broke, half of the Renault crews remained loyal to the Spanish Republic while the others joined the rebels. France later sent 32 FTs to the Republicans; the number of FTs sold to the Republicans by Poland is unclear; estimates vary between 16 and 94.

=== World War II and after ===

Renault FT tanks were also fielded in limited numbers during World War II, in Poland, Finland, France, Greece, Romania and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, although they were already obsolete. In May 1940, the French Army still had seven front-line battalions, each equipped with 63 FTs, one under-strength battalion as well as three independent companies, each with 10, for a total organic strength of 504. 105 more were in service in the colonies of Morocco and Algeria and 58 in French Levant, Madagascar and Indochina. Some FT tanks had also been buried within the ground and encased in concrete to supplement the Maginot Line.

The fact that several units used the Renault FT gave rise to the popular myth that the French had no modern equipment at all; actually, they had as many modern tanks as the Germans; however, the majority had one-man turrets and were less efficient than German tanks such as the Panzer III and IV. The French suffered from strategic and tactical weaknesses rather than from equipment deficiencies, although many of the French tanks were also markedly slow (unlike the German tanks of the time). When the best French units were cut off by the German drive to the English Channel, around 390 FTs, previously used for training or stored in depots, joined the 184 to 192 FTs in service with internal security units. The Wehrmacht captured 1,704 FTs. They used about 100 for airfield defence and about 650 for patrolling occupied Europe. Some were used by the Germans in 1944 for street-fighting in Paris, but by this time they were hopelessly out of date.

Vichy France used Renault FTs against Allied invasion forces during Operation Torch in Morocco and Algeria. The French tanks were no match for the newly arrived American M4 Sherman and M3 Stuart tanks. The last combat of the French Army FTs was during the Japanese invasion of French Indochina, when a section defended the Hue fortress.

The last known use was in the 1980s during the Soviet–Afghan War, when some FTs were used as pillboxes or roadblocks.

=== Derivatives ===
The FT was the ancestor of a long line of French tanks: the FT Kégresse, the NC1, the NC2, the Char D1, and the Char D2. The Italians produced the FIAT 3000, a moderately close copy of the FT, as their standard tank.

The Soviet Red Army captured 14 burnt-out Renaults from White Russian forces and rebuilt them at the Krasnoye Sormovo Factory in 1920. Nearly 15 exact copies, called &quot;Russki Renoe&quot;, were produced in 1920–1922, but they were never used in battle because of many technical problems. In 1928–1931, the first completely Soviet-designed tank was the T-18, a derivative of the Renault with sprung suspension.

== Variants ==
*&quot;Char canon&quot;: an FT with a 37 mm Puteaux SA18 short-barreled gun: about 3/5 of tanks ordered, about 1/3 of tanks actually produced
*&quot;Char mitrailleuse&quot;: an FT with an 8 mm Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun: about 2/5 of tanks ordered, about 3/5 of tanks produced
*FT 75 BS: a self propelled gun with a short barreled &quot;Blockhaus Schneider&quot; 75mm gun: 40 were produced.
*Char signal or TSF: a command tank with a radio. &quot;TSF&quot; stands for &quot;télégraphie sans fil&quot; (&quot;wireless&quot;). No armament, three-men crew, 300 ordered, 100 produced.
*FT &quot;modifié&quot; 31: upgraded tanks with 7.5 mm Reibel machine gun. After trials from 1929 to 1931, this modification was made in 1933–1934 on 1000 &quot;chars mitrailleurs&quot; still in French stocks. This version was sometimes referred to as the &quot;FT 31&quot;, though this was not the official name.
* FT &quot;désarmé&quot; : French &quot;char canon&quot; whose 37mm gun has been removed in the 1930s to arm modern tanks, and used for various purposes:
** &quot;Pont Bourguignon sur char FT&quot;: FT without turret carrying a light bridge, from an idea of General Louis Ferdinand Bourguignon.
** some were rearmed with an FM 24/29 light machine gun
*FT-&quot;Ko&quot;: Thirteen modified units imported by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1919, armed with either the 37mm SA18 cannon or machine guns; used in combat in the Manchurian Incident and subsequently for training
*M1917: US-built copy. 950 built, 374 of which were gun tanks and fifty of which were radio tanks. During World War II the Canadian Army purchased 236 redundant M1917s for training purposes.
*&quot;Russkiy Reno&quot;: the &quot;Russian Renault&quot;, the first Soviet tank, produced at Krasnoye Sormovo. A close copy. 17 units were produced. Also known as &quot;Tank M&quot; or &quot;KS tank&quot;.
*Renault FT CWS: the Renault FT CWS or &quot;Zelazny&quot; (&quot;iron&quot;) tanks were built in Poland for use as training vehicles only (Polish combat tanks were French manufactured). These tanks used spare French engines and components. The hulls and turrets were manufactured to French specifications in all other respects. Around 27 CWS FT tanks were built. CWS is the abbreviation for &quot;Centralne Warsztaty Samochodowe&quot; (translated as &quot;Central Workshops for Motor vehicles&quot; or &quot;Central Truck Workshop&quot;), a plant in Warsaw which performed maintenance and depot level repair.
*Renault M24/25: Also known as the Kégresse-Hinstin, these tanks were equipped with rubber Kégresse tracks and upgraded with detachable rollers on the front and rear for trench crossing. Saw action in the Rif War where it was found that it took too long to replace tracks when they came off so did not stay in service for long.
*Renault M26/27: a development of the FT with a different suspension and Kégresse rubber tracks; a number were used in Yugoslavia and five in Poland.
*FIAT 3000: an Italian derivation.
*T-18: A Soviet derivation with sprung suspension and Fiat engines.
* Polish gas tank: A Polish modification built in the &quot;Wojskowy Instytut Gazowy&quot; (&quot;Military Gas Institute&quot;) and tested on the Rembertów proving ground on 5 July 1926. Instead of a turret, the tank had twin gas cylinders. It was designed to create smoke screens, but could also be used for chemical attacks. Only one was produced.
* Renault FT AC: A December 1939 plan to convert France&#x27;s obsolete FTs into tank destroyers. The tank never left the drawing board. It was designed to have a 47mm APX anti-tank gun instead of the turret.

<doc id="354356" wikidata="Q177320" url="?curid=354356" title="Hulegu Khan">
<text>Hulegu Khan, also known as Hülegü or Hulagu ( 8 February 1265), was a Mongol ruler who conquered much of Western Asia. As a son of Tolui and the Keraite princess Sorghaghtani Beki, he was a grandson of Genghis Khan and brother of Ariq Böke, Möngke Khan, and Kublai Khan.

Hulegu&#x27;s army greatly expanded the southwestern portion of the Mongol Empire, founding the Ilkhanate in Persia. Under Hulegu&#x27;s leadership, the Mongols sacked and destroyed Baghdad, ending the Islamic Golden Age and the Abbasid dynasty. They also weakened Damascus, causing a shift of Islamic influence to the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo.

== Background ==
Hulegu was born to Tolui, one of Genghis Khan&#x27;s sons, and Sorghaghtani Beki, an influential Keraite princess and a niece of Toghrul in 1217. Not much is known of Hulegu&#x27;s childhood except of an anecdote given in Jami&#x27; al-Tawarikh and he once met his grandfather Genghis Khan with Kublai in 1224.

== Military campaigns ==

Hulegu&#x27;s brother Möngke Khan had been installed as Great Khan in 1251. Möngke charged Hulegu with leading a massive Mongol army to conquer or destroy the remaining Muslim states in southwestern Asia. Hulegu&#x27;s campaign sought the subjugation of the Lurs of southern Iran, the destruction of the Nizari Ismaili state (the Assassins), the submission or destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad, the submission or destruction of the Ayyubid states in Syria based in Damascus, and finally, the submission or destruction of the Bahri Mamluke Sultanate of Egypt. Möngke ordered Hulegu to treat kindly those who submitted and utterly destroy those who did not. Hulegu vigorously carried out the latter part of these instructions.

Hulegu marched out with perhaps the largest Mongol army ever assembled – by order of Möngke, two-tenths of the empire&#x27;s fighting men were gathered for Hulegu&#x27;s army in 1253. He arrived at Transoxiana in 1255. He easily destroyed the Lurs, and the Assassins surrendered their impregnable fortress of Alamut without a fight, accepting a deal that spared the lives of their people in early 1256. He chose Azerbaijan as his power base, while ordering Baiju to retreat to Anatolia. From at least 1257 onwards, Muslims and Christians of every major religious variety in Europe, the Middle East, and mainland Asia were a part of Hulegu&#x27;s army.

== Siege of Baghdad ==
Hulegu&#x27;s Mongol army set out for Baghdad in November 1257. Once near the city he divided his forces to threaten the city on both the east and west banks of the Tigris. Hulegu demanded surrender, but the caliph, Al-Musta&#x27;sim, refused. Due to the treason of Abu Alquma, an advisor to Al-Musta&#x27;sim, an uprising in the Baghdad army took place and Siege of Baghdad began. The attacking Mongols broke dikes and flooded the ground behind the caliph&#x27;s army, trapping them. Much of the army was slaughtered or drowned.

The Mongols under Chinese general Guo Kan laid siege to the city on 29 January 1258, constructing a palisade and a ditch and wheeling up siege engines and catapults. The battle was short by siege standards. By 5 February the Mongols controlled a stretch of the wall. The caliph tried to negotiate but was refused. On 10 February Baghdad surrendered. The Mongols swept into the city on 13 February and began a week of destruction. The Grand Library of Baghdad, containing countless precious historical documents and books on subjects ranging from medicine to astronomy, was destroyed. Citizens attempted to flee but were intercepted by Mongol soldiers.

Death counts vary widely and cannot be easily substantiated: A low estimate is about 90,000 dead; higher estimates range from 200,000 to a million. The Mongols looted and then destroyed buildings. Mosques, palaces, libraries, hospitals—grand buildings that had been the work of generations—were burned to the ground. The caliph was captured and forced to watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury plundered. &quot;Il Milione&quot;, a book on the travels of Venetian merchant Marco Polo, states that Hulegu starved the caliph to death, but there is no corroborating evidence for that. Most historians believe the Mongol and Muslim accounts that the caliph was rolled up in a rug and the Mongols rode their horses over him, as they believed that the earth would be offended if touched by royal blood. All but one of his sons were killed. Baghdad was a depopulated, ruined city for several centuries. Smaller states in the region hastened to reassure Hulegu of their loyalty, and the Mongols turned to Syria in 1259, conquering the Ayyubid dynasty and sending advance patrols as far ahead as Gaza.

A thousand squads of northern Chinese sappers accompanied Hulegu during his conquest of the Middle East.

== Conquest of Syria (1260) ==

In 1260 Mongol forces combined with those of their Christian vassals in the region, including the army of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia under Hethum I, King of Armenia and the Franks of Bohemond VI of Antioch. This force conquered Muslim Syria, a domain of the Ayyubid dynasty. They captured Aleppo by siege and, under the Christian general Kitbuqa, seized Damascus on 1 March 1260. A Christian Mass was celebrated in the Umayyad Mosque and numerous mosques were profaned. Many historical accounts describe the three Christian rulers Hethum, Bohemond, and Kitbuqa entering the city of Damascus together in triumph, though some modern historians such as David Morgan have questioned this story as apocryphal.

The invasion effectively destroyed the Ayyubids, which was until then a powerful dynasty that had ruled large parts of the Levant, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula. The last Ayyubid king, An-Nasir Yusuf, had been killed by Hulegu this same year. With Baghdad ravaged and Damascus weakened, the center of Islamic power shifted to the Mamluk sultan&#x27;s capital of Cairo.

Hulegu intended to send forces southward through Palestine toward Cairo. So he had a threatening letter delivered by an envoy to the Mamluk Sultan Qutuz in Cairo demanding that Qutuz open his city or it would be destroyed like Baghdad. Then, because food and fodder in Syria had become insufficient to supply his full force, and because it was a regular Mongol practice to move troops to the cooler highlands for the summer, Hulegu withdrew his main force to Iran near Azerbaijan, leaving behind one tumen (10,000 men or less) under Kitbuqa, accompanied by Armenian, Georgian, and Frankish volunteers, which Hulegu considered sufficient. Hulegu then personally departed for Mongolia to play his role in the imperial succession conflict occasioned by the death some eight months earlier of Great Khan Möngke. But upon receiving news of how few Mongols now remained in the region, Qutuz quickly assembled his well-trained and equipped 20,000-strong army at Cairo and invaded Palestine. He then allied himself with a fellow Mamluk leader, Baybars in Syria, who not only needed to protect his own future from the Mongols but was eager to avenge for Islam the Mongol capture of Damascus, looting of Baghdad, and conquest of Syria.

The Mongols, for their part, attempted to form a Frankish-Mongol alliance with (or at least, demand the submission of) the remnant of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, now centered on Acre, but Pope Alexander IV had forbidden such an alliance. Tensions between Franks and Mongols also increased when Julian of Sidon caused an incident resulting in the death of one of Kitbuqa&#x27;s grandsons. Angered, Kitbuqa had sacked Sidon. The Barons of Acre, contacted by the Mongols, had also been approached by the Mamluks, seeking military assistance against the Mongols. Although the Mamluks were traditional enemies of the Franks, the Barons of Acre recognized the Mongols as the more immediate menace. Instead of taking sides, the Crusaders opted for a position of cautious neutrality between the two forces. In an unusual move, however, they allowed the Egyptian Mamluks to march northward without hindrance through Crusader territory and even let them camp near Acre to resupply.

===Battle of Ain Jalut===
When news arrived that the Mongols had crossed the Jordan River in 1260, Sultan Qutuz and his forces proceeded southeast toward the &#x27;Spring of Goliath&#x27; (Known in Arabic as &#x27;Ain Jalut&#x27;) in the Jezreel Valley. They met the Mongol army of about 12,000 in the Battle of Ain Jalut and fought relentlessly for many hours. The Mamluk leader Baybars mostly implemented hit-and-run tactics in an attempt to lure the Mongol forces into chasing him. Baybars and Qutuz had hidden the bulk of their forces in the hills to wait in ambush for the Mongols to come into range. The Mongol leader Kitbuqa, already provoked by the constant fleeing of Baybars and his troops, decided to march forwards with all his troops on the trail of the fleeing Egyptians. When the Mongols reached the highlands, Egyptians appeared from hiding, and the Mongols found themselves surrounded by enemy forces as the hidden troops hit them from the sides and Qutuz attacked the Mongol rear. Estimates of the size of the Egyptian army range from 24,000 to 120,000. The Mongols broke free of the trap and even mounted a temporarily successful counterattack, but their numbers had been depleted to the point that the outcome was inevitable. Refusing to surrender, the whole Mongol army that had remained in the region, including Kitbuqa, were cut down and killed that day. The battle of Ain Jalut established a high-water mark for the Mongol conquest.

== Civil War ==

After the succession was settled and his brother Kublai Khan was established as Great Khan,
Hulegu returned to his lands by 1262. When he massed his armies to attack the Mamluks and avenge the defeat at Ain Jalut, however, he was instead drawn into civil war with Batu Khan&#x27;s brother Berke. Berke Khan, a Muslim convert and the grandson of Genghis Khan, had promised retribution in his rage after Hulegu&#x27;s sack of Baghdad and allied himself with the Mamluks. He initiated a large series of raids on Hulegu&#x27;s territories, led by Nogai Khan. Hulegu suffered a severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the Caucasus in 1263. This was the first open war between Mongols and signaled the end of the unified empire. In retaliation for his failure, Hulegu killed Berke&#x27;s ortogh, and Berke did the same in return.

Even while Berke was Muslim, out of Mongol brotherhood he at first resisted the idea of fighting Hulegu. He said, &quot;Mongols are killed by Mongol swords. If we were united, then we would have conquered all of the world.&quot; But the economic situation of the Golden Horde due to the actions of the Ilkhanate led him to declare jihad because the Ilkhanids were hogging the wealth of North Iran and because of the Ilkhanate&#x27;s demands for the Golden Horde not to sell slaves to the Mamluks.

== Communications with Europe ==
Hulegu&#x27;s mother Sorghaghtani successfully navigated Mongol politics, arranging for all of her sons to become Mongol leaders. She was a Christian of the Church of the East (often referred to as &quot;Nestorianism&quot;) and Hulegu was friendly to Christianity. Hulegu&#x27;s favorite wife, Doquz Khatun, was also a Christian, as was his closest friend and general, Kitbuqa. Hulegu sent multiple communications to Europe in an attempt to establish a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Muslims. In 1262, he sent his secretary Rychaldus and an embassy to &quot;all kings and princes overseas&quot;. The embassy was apparently intercepted in Sicily by Manfred, King of Sicily, who was allied with the Mamluk Sultanate and in conflict with Pope Urban IV, and Rychaldus was returned by ship.

On 10 April 1262, Hulegu sent a letter, through John the Hungarian, to Louis IX of France, offering an alliance. It is unclear whether the letter ever reached Louis IX in Paris – the only manuscript known to have survived was in Vienna, Austria. The letter stated Hulegu&#x27;s intention to capture Jerusalem for the benefit of the Pope and asked for Louis to send a fleet against Egypt:
Despite many attempts, neither Hulegu nor his successors were able to form an alliance with Europe, although Mongol culture in the West was in vogue in the 13th century. Many new-born children in Italy were named after Mongol rulers, including Hulegu: names such as Can Grande (&quot;Great Khan&quot;), Alaone (Hulegu), Argone (Arghun), and Cassano (Ghazan) are recorded.

== Death ==
Hulegu Khan fell seriously ill in January 1265 and died the following month on the banks of Zarrineh River (then called Jaghatu) and was buried on Shahi Island in Lake Urmia. His funeral was the only Ilkhanate funeral to feature human sacrifice. His tomb has never been found.

== Legacy ==
Hulegu Khan laid the foundations of the Ilkhanate and thus paved the way for the later Safavid dynastic state, and ultimately the modern country of Iran. Hulegu&#x27;s conquests also opened Iran to both European influence from the west and buddhist influence from the east. Thus, combined with patronage from his successors, would develop Iran&#x27;s distinctive excellence in architecture. Under Hulegu&#x27;s dynasty, Iranian historians began writing in Persian rather than Arabic. It is recorded however that he converted to Buddhism as he neared death, against the will of Doquz Khatun. The erection of a Buddhist temple at Ḵoy testifies his interest in that religion. Recent translations of various Tibetan monks&#x27; letters and epistles to Hulegu confirms that he was a lifelong Buddhist, following the Kagyu school.

Hulegu also patronized Nasir al-Din Tusi and his researches in Maragheh observatory. Another of his proteges were Juvayni brothers Ata Malik and Shams al-Din Juvayni. His reign as the ruler of Ilkhanate was peaceful and tolerant to diversity.

<text>KERNAL is Commodore&#x27;s name for the ROM-resident operating system core in its 8-bit home computers; from the original PET of 1977, followed by the extended but related versions used in its successors: the VIC-20, Commodore 64, Plus/4, Commodore 16, and Commodore 128.

==Description==
The Commodore 8-bit machines&#x27; KERNAL consists of the low-level, close-to-the-hardware OS routines roughly equivalent to the BIOS in IBM PC compatibles (in contrast to the BASIC interpreter routines, also located in ROM) as well as higher-level, device-independent I/O functionality. It is user-callable via a jump table in RAM whose central (oldest) part, for reasons of backwards compatibility, remains largely identical throughout the whole 8-bit series. The KERNAL ROM occupies the last 8 KB of the 8-bit CPU&#x27;s 64 KB address space ($E000–$FFFF). 

The jump table can be modified to point to user-written routines, for example, to integrate a fast loader so that its fast replacement routines are used system-wide or to replace the system text output routine with one that works in bitmapped mode rather than character mode. This use of a jump table was new to small computers then.

The Adventure International games published for the VIC-20 on the cartridge are an example of software that uses the KERNAL. Because they only use the jump table, the games can be memory dumped to disk, loaded into a Commodore 64, and run without modification.

The KERNAL was initially written for the Commodore PET by John Feagans, who introduced the idea of separating the BASIC routines from the operating system. It was further developed by several people, notably Robert Russell, who added many of the features for the VIC-20 and the C64.

==Example==
A simple, yet characteristic, example of using the KERNAL is given by the following 6502 assembly language subroutine (written in ca65 assembler format/syntax):

 CHROUT = $ffd2 ; CHROUT is the address of the character output routine
 CR = $0d ; PETSCII code for Carriage Return 
 hello:
 ldx #0 ; start with character 0 by loading 0 into the x index register
 next:
 lda message,x ; load byte from address message+x into the accumulator
 beq done ; if the accumulator holds zero, we&#x27;re done and want to branch out of the loop
 jsr CHROUT ; call CHROUT to output char to current output device (defaults to screen)
 inx ; increment x to move to the next character
 bne next ; loop back while the last character is not zero (max string length 255 bytes)
 done:
 rts ; return from subroutine
 message:
 .byte &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
 .byte CR, 0 ; Carriage Return and zero marking end of string

This code stub employs the codice_1 routine, whose address is found at address codice_2 (65490), to send a text string to the default output device (e.g., the display screen).

==The name==
The KERNAL was known as &quot;kernel&quot; inside of Commodore since the PET days, but in 1980 Robert Russell misspelled the word as &quot;kernal&quot; in his notebooks. When Commodore technical writers Neil Harris and Andy Finkel collected Russell&#x27;s notes and used them as the basis for the VIC-20 programmer&#x27;s manual, the misspelling followed them along and stuck.

According to early Commodore myth, and reported by writer/programmer Jim Butterfield among others, the &quot;word&quot; KERNAL is an acronym (or, more likely, a backronym) standing for &quot;Keyboard Entry Read, Network, And Link&quot;, which in fact makes good sense considering its role. Berkeley Softworks later used it when naming the core routines of its GUI OS for 8-bit home computers: the GEOS KERNAL.

== On device-independent I/O ==

Surprisingly, the KERNAL implemented a device-independent I/O API not entirely dissimilar from that of Unix or Plan-9, which nobody actually exploited, as far as is publicly known. Whereas one could reasonably argue that &quot;everything is a file&quot; in these latter systems, others could easily claim that &quot;everything is a GPIB-device&quot; in the former.

Due to limitations with the 6502 architecture at the time, opening an I/O channel requires three system calls. The first typically sets the logical filename through the codice_3 system call. The second call, codice_4, establishes the GPIB/IEEE-488 &quot;device&quot; address to communicate with. Finally codice_5 is called to perform the actual transaction. The application then used codice_6 and codice_7 system calls to set the application&#x27;s current input and output channels, respectively. Applications may have any number of concurrently open files (up to some system-dependent limit; e.g., the C64 allows for ten files to be opened at once). Thereafter, codice_8 and codice_1 prove useful for actually conducting input and output, respectively. codice_10 then closes a channel.

Observe that no system call exists to &quot;create&quot; an I/O channel, for devices cannot be created or destroyed dynamically under normal circumstances. Likewise, no means exists for seeking, nor for performing &quot;I/O control&quot; functions such as ioctl() in Unix. Indeed, the KERNAL proves much closer to the Plan-9 philosophy here, where an application would open a special &quot;command&quot; channel to the indicated device to conduct such &quot;meta&quot; or &quot;out-of-band&quot; transactions. For example, to delete (&quot;scratch&quot;) a file from a disk, the user typically will &quot;open&quot; the resource called codice_11 on device 8 or 9, channel 15. Per established convention in the Commodore 8-bit world, channel 15 represents the &quot;command channel&quot; for peripherals, relying on message-passing techniques to communicate both commands and results, including exceptional cases. For example, in Commodore BASIC, they might find software not unlike the following:

 70 ...
 80 REM ROTATE LOGS CURRENTLY OPENED ON LOGICAL CHANNEL #1.
 90 CLOSE 1
 100 OPEN 15,8,15,&quot;R0:ERROR.1=0:ERROR.0&quot;:REM RENAME FILE ERROR.0 TO ERROR.1
 110 INPUT# 15,A,B$,C,D:REM READ ERROR CHANNEL
 120 CLOSE 15
 130 IF A=0 THEN GOTO 200
 140 PRINT &quot;ERROR RENAMING LOG FILE:&quot;
 150 PRINT &quot; CODE: &quot;+A
 160 PRINT &quot; MSG : &quot;+B$
 170 END
 200 REM CONTINUE PROCESSING HERE, CREATING NEW LOG FILE AS WE GO...
 210 OPEN 1,8,1,&quot;0:ERROR.0,S,W&quot;
 220 ...

Device numbers, per established documentation, are restricted to the range [0,16]. However, this limitation came from the specific adaptation of the IEEE-488 protocol and, in effect, applies only to external peripherals. With all relevant KERNAL system calls vectored, programmers can intercept system calls to implement virtual devices with any address in the range of [32,256]. Conceivably, one can load a device driver binary into memory, patch the KERNAL I/O vectors, and from that moment forward, a new (virtual) device could be addressed. So far, this capability has never been publicly known as utilized, presumably for two reasons: (1) The KERNAL provides no means for dynamically allocating device IDs, and (2) the KERNAL provides no means for loading a relocatable binary image. Thus, the burden of collisions both in I/O space and in memory space falls upon the user, while platform compatibility across a wide range of machines falls upon the software author. Nonetheless, support software for these functions could easily be implemented if desired.

Logical filename formats tends to depend upon the specific device addressed. The most common device used, of course, is the floppy disk system, which uses a format similar to codice_12, where M is a flag of sorts ($ for directory listing, @ for indicating a desire to overwrite a file if it already exists, unused otherwise.), D is the (optional) physical disk unit number (0: or 1: for dual-drive systems, just 0: for single-disk units like the 1541, et al., which defaults to 0: if left unspecified), codice_13 is a resource name up to 16 characters in length (most characters allowed except for certain special characters), and codice_14 is an optional comma-separated list of attributes or flags. For example, if the user wants to overwrite a program file called codice_15, they might see a filename like codice_16 used in conjunction with device 8 or 9. Meanwhile, a filename for the RS-232 driver (device 2) consists simply of four characters, encoded in binary format.

Other devices, such as the keyboard (device 0), cassette (device 1), the display interface (device 3), and printer (device 4 and 5), require no filenames to function, either assuming reasonable defaults or simply not needing them at all.
