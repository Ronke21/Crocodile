<text>Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad ibn Jarīr ibn Yazīd al-Ṭabarī (; 839–923 CE / 224–310 AH), commonly known as al-Ṭabarī (), was a Sunni Muslim scholar, polymath, historian, exegete, jurist, and theologian from Amol, Tabaristan, present-day Iran. Among the most prominent figures of the Islamic Golden Age, al-Tabari is widely known for his historical works and expertise in Quranic exegesis, and has been described as &quot;an impressively prolific polymath&quot;. He authored works on a diverse range of subjects, including world history, poetry, lexicography, grammar, ethics, mathematics, and medicine. Among his most famous and influential works are his Quranic commentary, &quot;Tafsir al-Tabari&quot;, and historical chronicle, &quot;Tarikh al-Tabari&quot;.

Al-Tabari followed the Shafi&#x27;i school for nearly a decade before he developed his own interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence. His understanding of it was both sophisticated and remarkably fluid, and, as such, he continued to develop his ideas and thoughts on juristic matters right until the end of his life.

Al-Tabari&#x27;s school of jurisprudence &quot;flourished among Sunni ulama for two centuries after his death&quot;, before it eventually became extinct. It was commonly designated as the Jariri school.

==Biography==
Tabari was born in Amol, Tabaristan (some 20 km south of the Caspian Sea) in the winter of 838–39. He has been described as either of Persian or Arab origin. He memorized the Qur&#x27;an at seven, was a qualified prayer leader at eight, and began to study the prophetic traditions at nine. He left home to study in 236 AH (850/1 AD), when he was twelve. He retained close ties to his hometown. He returned at least twice, the second time in 290 AH (903 AD), when his outspokenness caused some uneasiness and led to his quick departure.

He first went to Ray (Rhages), where he remained for some five years. A major teacher in Rayy was Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Humayd al-Razi, who had earlier taught in Baghdad, but was now in his seventies While in Ray, he also studied Muslim jurisprudence according to the Hanafi school. Among other material, ibn Humayd taught Jarir Tabari the historical works of ibn Ishaq, especially &quot;al-Sirah&quot;, the life of Muhammad. Tabari was thus introduced in youth to pre-Islamic and early Islamic history. Tabari quotes ibn Humayd frequently, but little is known about Tabari&#x27;s other teachers in Rayy.

Tabari then travelled to study in Baghdad under Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who, however, had recently died (in late 855 or early 856). Tabari possibly made a pilgrimage prior to his first arrival in Baghdad. He left Baghdad probably in 242 AH (856/7 AD) to travel through the southern cities of Basra, Kufah and Wasit. There, he met a number of eminent and venerable scholars. In addition to his previous study of Hanafi law, Tabari also studied the Shafi&#x27;i, Maliki and Zahiri rites. Tabari&#x27;s study of the latter school was with the founder, Dawud al-Zahiri, and Tabari hand-copied and transmitted many of his teacher&#x27;s works. Tabari was then well-versed in four of the five remaining Sunni legal schools, before founding his own independent, yet eventually extinct, school. His debates with his former teachers and classmates were known, and served as a demonstration of said independence. Notably missing from this list is the Hanbali school, the fourth largest legal school within Sunni Islam in the present era. Tabari&#x27;s view of Ibn Hanbal, the school&#x27;s founder, became decidedly negative later in life. Tabari did not give Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s dissenting opinion any weight at all when considering the various views of jurists, stating that Ibn Hanbal had not even been a jurist at all but merely a recorder of Hadith.

On his return to Baghdad, he took a tutoring position from the vizier, Ubaydallah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan. This would have been before A.H. 244 (858), since the vizier was out of office and in exile from 244 to 248 (858–9 to 862). There is an anecdote telling that Tabari had agreed to tutor for ten dinars a month, but his teaching was so effective and the boy&#x27;s writing so impressive that the teacher was offered a tray of dinars and dirhams. The ever-ethical Tabari declined the offer, saying he had undertaken to do his work at the specified amount, and could not honorably take more. That is one of a number of narratives about him declining gifts or giving gifts of equal or greater amount in return.

In his late twenties, he travelled to Syria, Palestine, India and Egypt. In Beirut, he made the highly significant connection of al-Abbas ibn al-Walid ibn Mazyad al-&#x27;Udhri al-Bayruti (c. 169–270/785–86 to 883–84). Al-Abbas instructed Tabari in the Syrian school&#x27;s variant readings of the Qur&#x27;an and transmitted through his father al-Walid the legal views of al-Awza&#x27;i, Beirut&#x27;s prominent jurist from a century earlier.

Tabari arrived in Egypt in 253 AH (867 AD), and some time after 256/870, he returned to Baghdad, possibly making a pilgrimage on the way. If so, he did not stay long in the Hijaz. Tabari had a private income from his father while he was still living, and then the inheritance. He took money for teaching. Among Tabari&#x27;s students was Ibn al-Mughallis, who was also a student of Tabari&#x27;s own teacher Muhammad bin Dawud al-Zahiri; Ibn al-Mughallis lavished Tabari with almost excessive praise. He never took a government or a judicial position.

Tabari was some fifty years old when al-Mu&#x27;tadid became caliph. He was well past seventy in the year his &quot;History&quot; was published. During the intervening years, he was a famous (if somewhat controversial) personality. Among the figures of his age, he had access to sources of information equal to anyone, except, perhaps, those who were directly connected with decision making within the government. Most, if not all, the materials for the histories of al-Mu&#x27;tadid, al-Muktafi, and the early years of al-Muqtadir, were collected by him about the time the reported events took place. His accounts are as authentic as one can expect from that period. Tabari final years were marked by conflict with the Hanbalite followers of Al-Hasan ibn &#x27;Ali al-Barbahari, a student of the students of Ibn Hanbal. Tabari was known for his view that Hanbalism was not a legitimate school of thought, as Ibn Hanbal was a compiler of traditions and not a proper jurist. The Hanbalites of Baghdad would often stone Tabari&#x27;s house, escalating the persecution to the point where Abbasid authorities had to subdue them by force. The Baghdad chief of police tried to organize a debate between Tabari and the Hanbalites to settle their differences. While Tabari accepted, the Hanbalites did not show up, but instead came later to pelt his house with stones again. The constant threat of violence from the Hanbalites hung over Tabari&#x27;s head for the rest of his life.

Tabari died on 17 February 923. Some sources suggest that Abbasid authorities buried Tabari at night in secret as they feared mob violence by the Hanbalites, but these reports are uncertain, and other sources agree that he was buried in the morning after his death. Either way, he was buried in his home. Regardless, Tabari was remembered positively by contemporaries such as Ibn Duraid, and the Hanbalites were condemned by Abbasid authorities in their entirety for persecuting opponents, roughly a decade later. They even prevented people from meeting with him, and Ibn Jarir remained trapped in his home until he died. The period in which Tabari lived was full of religious differences and political unrest, which was characterized by the stigmatization and accusation of individuals.
==Personal characteristics==
He is described as having a dark complexion, large eyes and a long beard. He was tall and slender and his hair and beard remained black until he was very old. He was attentive to his health, avoiding red meat, fats, and other foods he deemed unhealthy. He was seldom sick before his last decade, when he suffered from bouts of pleurisy. When he was ill, he treated himself (to the disapproval of physicians). He had a sense of humor, though serious subjects he treated seriously. He had studied poetry when young and enjoyed writing, reciting and participating in poetic exchanges. It is said that he was asked in Egypt about al-Tirimmah, and was able to recite this 7th century poet&#x27;s work for Egyptians who had merely heard al-Tirimmah&#x27;s name.
Ali ibn al-Athir, in his memoirs, he confirmed these features. He was witty and urbane, clean, and well mannered. He avoided coarse speech, instead displaying refined eloquence. He had a good grounding in grammar, lexicography, and philology. Such were considered essential for Qur&#x27;anic commentary. He knew Persian and was acquainted with the origins of various foreign loan words in Arabic from a number of other languages.

He died in Baghdad on 17 February 923.
== Tabari&#x27;s ordeal with Hanbalites ==
His ijtihad (independent judgement) led to criticism from the Zahiri and some Hanbali followers. Though his conflict with the leaders of the Zahiri school was resolved, his disagreements with the Hanbalis were more deep-set, leading to a violent altercation in which he was besieged in his own home. The disagreement was mainly jurisprudential -- al-Tabari did not seem to think much of ibn Hanbal as a jurist, but mainly saw him as a scholar of hadith. Al-Tabari was also accused of being a Jahmite heretic, while his respect for &#x27;Ali ibn Abi Talib exposed him to accusations of Shi&#x27;ite sympathies. At the same time, he incurred the wrath of the Shi&#x27;ites by defending the previous three caliphs.

In Baghdad, three Hanbalites (who do not seem further identifiable) asked al-Tabari about his views on a tradition attributed to Mujahid ibn Jabr, concerning the explanation of the verse 79 from Surat al-Isra&#x27; in the Qur&#x27;an about the Praiseworthy Station of Muhammad, known as &quot;al-Maqam al-Mahmud&quot;.

The verse is: And rise at ˹the last˺ part of the night, offering additional prayers, so your Lord may raise you to a station of praise.

In the books of Tafsir (interpretation of the Qur&#x27;an), authors said that the Praiseworthy Station (al-Maqam al-Mahmud) said in the above verse is the most highest place in Paradise, which will be granted to the Muhammad and none else, and the position of intercession (Shafa&#x27;a) will be giving to him by permission of God on behalf of the believers on the Day of Judgment. Muhammad will intercede on their behalf, so that God will relieve them of the suffering of such a situation. However, the Hanbalites interpreted the Praiseworthy Station as the seat of Muhammad by God on the Throne, despite the overall weakness of the narrations supporting it.

Al-Tabari is said to have declared bluntly that it was absurd. Moreover, he recited:

Upon hearing this, the fanatic Hanbali followers attacked him fiercely, and stoned his residence and caused a serious disturbance which had to be subdued by force. Trouble with the Hanbalites that took a similar form was also reported at the time of al-Tabari&#x27;s death. In connection with it, Nazuk is mentioned as chief of police. He was appointed to this position only in 310/922, the year al-Tabari died, but he appears to have held high positions in the police before, and may already have been in charge of al-Tabari&#x27;s protection against potential Hanbalite violence. In 309/921, the wazir &#x27;Ali b. &#x27;Isa had offered al-Tabari the opportunity to debate the matter with the Hanbalites in his residence. Al-Tabari agreed, but the Hanbalites did not show up. However, shortly before his death, Hanbalite rioters supposedly pelted his house with stones so numerous that they formed a large wall in front of it.

According to Franz Rosenthal, &quot;The role of Hanbalite hostility, though real, seems to have been exaggerated in connection with his death as it was in his life.&quot; He further adds that &quot;Those who knew Tabari best always played down the inconveniences he suffered from the Hanbalites.&quot;

==Works==

Al-Tabari wrote history, theology and Qur&#x27;anic commentary. His principal and most influential works were:
*&quot;Tafsir al-Tabari&quot; (&#x27;Commentary of al-Tabari&#x27;); Qur&#x27;anic commentary (tafsir).
*&quot;Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk&quot; (History of the Prophets and Kings), historical chronicle, often referred to as &quot;Tarikh al-Tabari&quot;.

His legal texts, commentaries and Qur&#x27;anic exegesis, and history, produced respectively, were published throughout his lifetime. Biographers stress his reverence for scholarship, objectivity, and independent judgement (&quot;ijtihad&quot;). He rates the credibility of his sources from a theological rather than an historical standpoint, yet he opposed religious innovation. In one anecdote, Abu Kamil suggested him when he was near death, to forgive his enemies, which he agreed to, apart from one who called him an innovator. Tabari was generally conciliatory, moderate, and affable.

Initially, Tabari belonged to the Shafi&#x27;ite madhhab (school) of fiqh (Islamic law), and was welcomed by them. He established his own madhhab, usually designated the Jariri madhhab after his patronymic. His school failed to endure in the competitive atmosphere of the times. As a youth in Baghdad, he had applied to the Hanbalite&#x27;s but received a hostile rejection.

Al-Tabari&#x27;s jurisprudence belongs to a type which Christopher Melchert has called &quot;Rationalism&quot;, largely associated with the Shafi&#x27;i madhhab. It was characterized by strong scripturalist tendencies. He appears, like Dawud al-Zahiri, to restrict consensus historically, defining it as the transmission by many authorities of reports on which the Sahaba agreed unanimously. Like Dawud al-Zahiri, he also held that consensus must be tied to a text and cannot be based on legal analogy.

While we still lack a satisfactory scholarly biography of this remarkable scholar, interested readers now have access to a meticulous and well-annotated translation of the sections from al-Tabari&#x27;s chronicle, which constitute the most important primary source for the
history of his reign. Anyone familiar with al-Tabari&#x27;s chronicle knows what a formidable challenge it poses for a translator, especially for one attempting to make it accessible to an audience that includes non-specialists. There is first of all the obstacle of al-Tabari&#x27;s Arabic prose, which varies greatly in style and complexity, according to the source he is using (and apparently quoting verbatim). The sections in the McAuliffe translation, drawn mostly from al-Mada&#x27;ini and &#x27;Umar ibn Shabba, do not represent the most obscure passages to be found in al-Tabari, but they are nonetheless full of linguistic ambiguities and difficulties for the translator.

He wrote extensively; his voluminous corpus containing three main titles:

*&quot;History of the Prophets and Kings&quot; – (&quot;Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk&quot;, commonly called &quot;Tarikh al-Tabari&quot;)

The first of the two large works, generally known as the &quot;Annals&quot; (Arabic &quot;Tarikh al-Tabari&quot;). This is a universal history from the time of Qur&#x27;anic Creation to 915, and is renowned for its detail and accuracy concerning Muslim and Middle Eastern history. Tabari&#x27;s work is one of the major primary sources for historians. The History commenced with the Creation, followed by accounts regarding the patriarchs, prophets, and rulers of antiquity. The history of the Sasanian Empire came next. For the period of Muhammad&#x27;s life, al-Ṭabarī drew upon the extensive researches of 8th-century Medinan scholars. Although pre-Islamic influences are evident in their works, the Medinan perspective of Muslim history evolved as a theocentric (god-centred) universal history of prophecy, culminating in the career of Muhammad and not as a continuum of tribal wars and values. The sources for al-Ṭabarī&#x27;s History covering the years from the Prophet’s death to the fall of the Umayyad dynasty (661–750 CE) were short monographs, each treating a major event or the circumstances attending the death of an important person. Al-Ṭabarī supplemented this material with historical reports embodied in works on genealogy, poetry, and tribal affairs. Further, details of the early ʿAbbāsid period were available to him in a few histories of the caliphs that unfortunately have come down only in the fragments preserved by al-Ṭabarī. Almost all of these accounts reflected an Iraqi perspective of the community; coupled with this is al-Ṭabarī’s scant attention to affairs in Egypt, North Africa, and Muslim Spain, so that his History does not have the secular “universal” outlook sometimes attributed to it. From the beginning of the Muslim era (dated from 622, the date of the hijrah—the Prophet Muhammad’s migration from Mecca to Medina), the History is arranged as a set of annals according to the years after the hijrah. It terminates in the year 915.

*&quot;The Commentary on the Qur&#x27;an&quot; – (&quot;Commentary al-Tabari&quot;)

His second great work was the commentary on the Qur&#x27;an, (Arabic &quot;Tafsir al-Tabari&quot;), which was marked by the same fullness of detail as the &quot;Annals&quot;. Abul-Qaasim Ibn &#x27;Aqil Al-Warraq says: &quot; Imām Ibn Jarir once said to his students: “Are you all ready to write down my lesson on the commentary of the entire Holy Quran?&quot; They enquired as to how lengthy it would be. &quot;30 000 pages&quot;! he replied. They said: &quot;This would take a long time and cannot be completed in one lifetime. He therefore made it concise and kept it to 3000 pages (note, this was in reference to the old days when they used ink and hard-paper which was a bit long format today). It took him seven years to finish it from the year 283 until 290.
*&quot;Tahdhīb al-Athār&quot; was begun by Tabari. This was on the traditions transmitted from the Companions of Muhammad. It was not, however, completed.

A perusal of Tabari shows that he in fact relied on a variety of historians and other authors, such as Abu Mihnaf, Sayf b. &#x27;Umar, Ibn al-Kalbi, &#x27;Awana ibn al-Hakam, Nasr b. Muzahim, al-Mada&#x27;ini, &#x27;Urwa b. al-Zubayr, al-Zuhri, Ibn Ishaq, Waqidi, Wahb b. Munabbih, Ka&#x27;b al-Ahbar, Ibn al-Matni, al Haggag b. al-Minhal, Hisham b. &#x27;Urwa, al-Zubayr b. Bakkar and so forth, in addition to oral accounts that were circulating at the time. In recounting his history, Tabari used numerous channels to give accounts. These are both channels that are given by the same author in a work, such as for example three different accounts that start with the isnad al-Harita.

Although no subject in history, recitation of the Quran and its interpretation, poetry, grammar and vocabulary, ethics, mathematics, and theology remained untouched by Tabari, he is primarily known as the author and author of history.

==Translations of Tabari&#x27;s book==
Theodor Nöldeke, the German orientalist in 1878 has also translated the Sassanid section of Tabari&#x27;s history into German, and has since been reprinted several times.

Dutch orientalist Michael Jan de Goeje, in several volumes, translated Tabari&#x27;s history book into Dutch, The book was later translated into English and republished in 1998 by State University of New York Press and Paris Diderot University. Hermann Zotenberg published the history of Tabari in French Language in four volumes in Paris. His book on the nativities and history was translated into Latin by Giovanni da Siviglia and published in Venice in 1503. Franz Rosenthal translated in 1989 Tabari history book of three volumes, with title &quot;History of the Middle East&quot;.

Clifford Edmund Bosworth, published the book History of Tabari in three volumes with an introduction by Ehsan Yarshater in 1999 in the United States, Albania and France. Planning for the translation of this great chronicle book into English in forty volumes began in 1971, led by Ehsan Yarshater as General Editor and assisted by an Editorial Board Ihsan Abbas, American University of Beirut, Clifford Edmund Bosworth University of Manchester, Jacob Lassner Wayne State University, as Supervising Editor, and Franz Rosenthal in Yale University. Estelle Whelan at the Columbia Center for Iranian Studies served as Editorial Coordinator.

Ignác Goldziher Hungarian scholar, wrote in 1920 a book focusing on Tabari, titled in German as &quot;Die Richtungen der islamischen Koranauslegung&quot;, and it was published by Brill Publishers. Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary also published the complete History of the Prophets and Kings in 17 volumes in his center. W. Montgomery Watt researched the history of Tabari, and from 1987 to 1999 published the book History of Tabari entitled &quot;Muhammad at Mecca&quot;. Also Manuscripts Tabari history, Tabari interpretation and translation of Tabari history stored in Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi.

Moshe Pearlman, Ismail Poonawala, Fred Donner, Hugh N. Kennedy, Khalid Yahya Blankinship, R. Stephen Humphreys, Michael G. Morony, G. R. Hawting, Martin Hinds, Carole Hillenbrand, George Saliba, and Yohanan Friedmann authors and researchers were prominent, they published a collection of books on the history of Tabari with different titles.

==Texts relating to al-Tabari==
Al-Azdi was an extremely early witness to the reception of al-Tabari&#x27;s text - indeed, much earlier than the sources that are customarily used to improve our understanding of the &quot;Tarikh al-rusul wa-l-muluk&quot;, e.g., Miskawayh, Ibn Asakir, Ibn al-Athir, and Ibn Khallikan. Second, since al-Azdi was writing in the decades following al-Tabari, his &quot;Tarikh&quot; can say something about the reception of al-Tabari &quot;Tarikh&quot; among those who immediately followed the great master. That al-Tabari&#x27;s history was immensely significant we can all agree; but as to precisely how he became so significant there is no clear consensus. Returning to Forand&#x27;s insight, al-Azdi frequently drew on the same authorities tapped by al-Tabari, but whose works are for the most part now lost, such as Abu Ma&#x27;shar (170/786), Abu Mikhnaf (157/774), al-Haytham ibn &#x27;Adi (207/822), al-Madaini (around 228/843), and &#x27;Umar ibn Shabba (262/878).

Realistic depictions alternate with formalized and archetypal narrative. Tabari is careful to give his reports of these conquests a religious frame (expressions such as &quot;Nu&#x27;aym wrote to &#x27;Umar about the victory that God had given him&quot; [pp. 25–26] abound), though it is worth noting that Tabari describes the initiation of the campaign in pragmatic rather than ideological terms. He states that &#x27;Umar&#x27;s decision to invade came as a result of his realization Yazdegerd was making war on him every year, and when it was suggested to him that he would continue to do this until he was driven out of his kingdom&quot; (p. 2). The religious frame in Tabari&#x27;s account is therefore not inflexible or exclusive.

==Reception==
In 2015, a statue of Jarir Tabari, along with another Iranian scientist, Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi, was erected in the courtyard of the National Library of Tajikistan.
There are streets and schools named after him in Riyadh, Doha, Amol, Qazvin, Khobar, Aqaba, Madaba, Beirut, Dhahran, Heliopolis, Kuwait, Homs, Hama and Baghdad.

Abdolhossein Zarrinkoob and Lefebvre Lucidio in a speech at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, founded the Tabari History Research Structure Institute. The Jarir Tabari first international commemoration in 1989, with a suggestion by Mohammad Ebrahim Bastani Parizi was held by Kayhan magazine at Mazandaran University.
In 1987, The ERTU (Egyptian Radio and Television Union) produced the first TV series that presented the life of Jarir Tabari under the name “Imam al-Tabari”, it was directed by Magdy Abou Emira starring Ezzat El Alaili. In addition to Egypt, the biographical series was shown on Arabic channels in other countries.

<text>The South Australian National Football League, or SANFL ( or &quot;S-A-N-F-L&quot;), is an Australian rules football league based in the Australian state of South Australia. It is also the state&#x27;s governing body for the sport.

Originally formed as the South Australian Football Association on 30 April 1877, the SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code in Australia and is the 7th-oldest club football league in the world. For most of its existence, the league was considered one of the traditional &quot;big three&quot; Australian rules football leagues, along with the Victorian Football League and West Australian Football League. Since the introduction of two South Australia-based clubs into the Australian Football League – the Adelaide Crows in 1991 and the Port Adelaide Power in 1997 – the popularity and standard of the league has decreased to the point where it is considered a feeder competition to the Australian Football League.

Consisting of a single-division competition since the admission of the Adelaide Crows reserves in 2014, the season has since been a 10-team, 18-round home-and-away (regular) season from April to September. The top five teams play off in a final series culminating in the grand final for the Thomas Seymour Hill Premiership Trophy. The grand final had traditionally been held at Football Park in October, generally the week after the AFL Grand Final, though this was altered ahead of the 2014 season, resulting in Adelaide Oval hosting the grand final in the penultimate weekend of September.

The semi-professional league is considered the strongest competition after the fully professional Australian Football League (AFL) . The league owned the sub-licences for South Australia&#x27;s two AFL clubs—Adelaide Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club—until March 2014, when South Australian Football Commission reached an agreement with the Adelaide and Port Adelaide clubs—endorsed by the AFL—which will see the two AFL licences transferred to the clubs in return for payments totalling more than $18 million.

The league is also responsible for the management of all levels of football in the state. This includes junior football, country football, amateur football and specific programs rolled out across schools, indigenous communities (including the APY Lands in the state&#x27;s north) and newly arrived migrant communities.

The SANFL owned Football Park, formerly the largest stadium in South Australia. The stadium, which opened in 1974, was primarily used for Australian Football League matches up until 2013 and had a capacity of over 51,000 prior to being demolished. The stadium was the headquarters for the league from 1974 to 2013. The SANFL competition is the second highest attended Australian rules football league behind the AFL.

== History ==

=== Before 1877 ===


The first recorded game of any &quot;football&quot; in South Australia was that of &#x27;Caid&#x27; played in Thebarton by people of the local Irish community in 1843 to celebrate St Patrick&#x27;s Day. In 1844, there was debate amongst the South Australian Legislative Council whether it be allowed that &quot;foot-ball&quot; be played on Sundays, with arguments against preferring the quiet worship of God. In 1859, the Gawler Institute ran a rural fete which included a game of football being staged.

The earliest recorded Australian rules football club in South Australia was Adelaide Football Club (unrelated to the modern day Adelaide Football Club), formed in April 1860. An advertisement, sponsored by John Acraman, W.J. Fullarton and R. Cussen noted that group had already gathered 30 members. 
 The club initially only played internal matches between players located North and South of the River Torrens.

By 1871 a number of new clubs were formed. In addition to the Old Adelaide Club, Port Suburban (founded in 1868 and renamed Woodville in 1870), Port Adelaide and Young Australians both formed in 1870 and Kensington were the principal clubs that were organising interclub matches. Country clubs had also been established at Gawler, Kapunda and Willunga and the City clubs would sometimes be hosted by these clubs principally on Public Holidays.

The early years of interclub football began to be dogged by arguments over which set of rules to adopt. A meeting of three delegates from each of the three clubs—Adelaide, Kensington and Port Adelaide—held a meeting on 10 March 1873, with Charles Kingston from Adelaide voted as chair in an attempted to draw up a standard code of playing rules.

However, after a match between Port Adelaide and Kensington in July 1873, it was remarked that neither side understood the rules clearly. As the years progressed, there became a growing push for uniformity and structure in South Australian football.

On Wednesday 22 March 1876, a meeting of the South Adelaide Football Club, which had formed the previous year, was held at the Arab Steed Hotel. There was a good attendance, and officers and Committee for the season were elected. Dissatisfaction was expressed relative to the rules by which matches were conducted last season, and the Secretary was instructed to communicate with the various Clubs in order to arrange for regulations. It was remarked that scarcely a game was played last season without some misunderstanding arising, some playing by the Old Adelaide Club, and others the Kensington Club rules. After a lengthy discussion the meeting adjourned to receive a report from the Secretary and Committee.

===1876: Adoption of standard rules by clubs===
A meeting of those interested in football was held at the Prince Alfred Hotel on Thursday evening, July 20, to consider the question of a uniform code of rules to be adopted by the various Clubs. There were 56 persons present, including representatives from the Old Adelaide, South Adelaide, Woodville, and Victorian Clubs. Mr. T. Lotchford presided. Mr. C. C. Kingston, in explaining the object of the meeting, mentioned that a circular bad been issued about six weeks previously by the Kensington Football Club, calling upon the Clubs in and around Adelaide to appoint delegates to consider the question of adopting a uniform code of rules. Nothing, however, had followed the issuing of the circular, and the meeting that evening was called in consequence. He was extremely pleased to see so large an attendance, as it augured well for a revival of the manly game, which, owing to what he considered a foolish modification of what were known as the old Adelaide rules, had sadly degenerated. The regulations generally known as the Kensington roles had during the last two seasons in which they had been adopted only provoked continual disputes when matches were engaged in. He was sure they all desired to see the game prosper in the colony, and that by a suitable code of rules encouragement should be given to the exhibition of skill, strength, and pluck, while all matches might be played under a spirit of friendly rivalry, thus making the game enjoyable and interesting not only to players, but to spectators. He then moved that the rules played in Victoria should be considered. They differed but slightly from the old Adelaide rules. If such rules were adopted he felt sure that football would be carried on far
more successfully than had bean the case lately, and there would be a greater probability of intercolonial matches being arranged, as he hoped would be the case at no distant date. (Applause.) Mr. A. Crooks having seconded the motion, the Melbourne Football Rules were considered seriatim and adopted In their entirety, with the exception of Rules 6, 7, and 8. which were amended in a manner to assimilate somewhat to the old Adelaide rules. An addition to
Rule 6 provided that no player having claimed his mark should run with the ball. Rule 7 was struck out, and the following substituted:—
&quot; The ball may be taken in hand at any time, but the player shall be liable to be held or thrown until he drops it.&quot; An addition to Rule 8 provided that pushing from behind should only be allowable when the player was running. The chief alterations in the game as hitherto played in Adelaide are the dispensing with the cross bar and top rope in favour of two upright posts of unlimited height, and the substitution of an oval football for the round one. Messrs.
C. C. Kingston, A. Crooks, J. A. Osborne, T.Letchford, and C. D. Perkins were appointed a Committee to confer with the Secretaries of other Clubs with a view to securing their concurrence in the action taken by the meeting. They were also empowered to consider the question of offering a Challenge Cup for next season. The meeting then closed. 
=== 1877–1887: SAFA establishment and the early years===
In 1877, following an initial meeting called by Richard Twopeny on Thursday 19 April 1877 at Prince Alfred Hotel delegates from 13 of South Australia&#x27;s football clubs met to develop a uniform set of rules and establish a governing body. The South Australian Football Association was formed at a meeting called at the Prince Alfred Hotel in King William Street, Adelaide on 30 April 1877, and adopted rules similar to those used in Victoria upon the urging of Charles Cameron Kingston. The use of an oval ball, bouncing the ball and pushing from behind forbidden amongst the rules agreed at the meeting.

The clubs that sent 2 delegates each to the meeting were: South Park, Willunga, Port Adelaide, Adelaide, North Adelaide, Prince Alfred College, Gawler, Kapunda, Bankers, Woodville, South Adelaide, Kensington, and Victorian.

The inaugural 1877 SAFA season was contested by 8 clubs. A total of 4 games were also played by Adelaide and Woodville when they were hosted twice each by the country clubs Gawler and Kapunda on public holidays but these weren&#x27;t counted in the premiership table at the end of the season. South Adelaide and Victorian were declared joint Club Champions.
In 1878, a brand new club Norwood was formed following the entire collapse of Woodville by a number of former players and it joined the Association for the season.

An end of season match on 31 August between a combined Adelaide Team from the Association against a combined team from the 3 country clubs – Gawler, Kapunda and Willunga was played on the Adelaide Ground. With the Adelaide team winning 5 goals to 1.

In 1880 it was proposed to create a Junior Football Association, similar to the Cricket Association, from Clubs such as the North Parks, St. Peter&#x27;s College, Prince Alfred College, Royal Parks, West Torrens, Woodville, South Suburban, Hotham, and Middlesex.

In 1881 - Adelaide and Kensington merged at a meeting held on 11 April it was decided that the colour of the merged club be black-and scarlet guernsey, hose, and cap, and navy blue knickerbockers. The SAFA was notified in writing of the amalgamation which was read at a meeting held on 27 April 1881. The merged club played 4 games before resigning on 1 June.

In 1882 - The first general meeting of the committee of the Junior Football Association was held at the Prince Alfred Hotel on Monday evening, March 27. All the clubs - North Parks, North Adelaide Juniors, Kensington, Kent Town, Albion, Triton, and West Torrens were represented. Later some of these clubs would be admitted to the Senior Association - North Parks would merge with North Adelaide Juniors and join as Adelaide in 1885 and West Torrens as West Adelaide in 1887.

In May 1884 - A proposal to merge the senior Association (SAFA) with the Junior Association (called the Adelaide and Suburban Association) was started with 5 delegates from each Association to confer as what steps can be taken but was in the end rejected by the SAFA.

Of the original senior clubs – Bankers (1877), Woodville (1877), Adelaide and Kensington (1881 after merging), South Park (1884), Victorian (1884) - i.e. 6 of the original 8 had all left the competition by the start of the 1885 Season. Only Port Adelaide and South Adelaide hadn&#x27;t folded or resigned.

In 1885, a new Adelaide Club joined the senior competition and won the Premiership the following season. The club was formed from a merger of North Adelaide Juniors (which had renamed to Adelaide in 1884) and North Parks. Upon merger and admission the Club took up the Old Adelaide colours of Black and Red.

In 1887 another three Clubs were admitted Hotham and West Adelaide and the only country team ever admitted Gawler Albion but all only lasted for a few seasons.

West Adelaide folded after just one season (1887), their resignation was accepted at the Annual General Meeting held on 5 April 1888, as they were unable to get a team together. At the same meeting permission was given for Hotham to change their name to North Adelaide and for Gawler to remove the word Albion from their name.

=== 1888–1896 SAFA splinters and re-establishes under new Association and Rules===

The 1888 SAFA season was started under a cloud, as a dispute arose when the old senior clubs Adelaide, Port Adelaide and South Adelaide all withdrew and resigned from the SAFA and created their own Association and had invited a junior club Medindie to join them. The split meant Norwood was the only senior club left in the original SAFA along with the two new clubs which had just joined the year before Gawler and Hotham. The result was the old South Australian Football Association being wound up and a new one formed termed &#x27;The South Australian United Football Association&#x27;. The three remaining SAFA clubs Norwood, Gawler and Hotham (North Adelaide) then had to applied to join this new Association which had a number of new rules.

In 1888, a junior club Medindie (which would rename itself North Adelaide Football Club in 1893) joined this new Association to maintain a seven team competition. Medindie was a foundation member in 1885 of the South Australian Junior Football Association, before spending the 1886 and 1887 seasons competing in the Adelaide and Suburban Football Association.

Hotham which renamed to North Adelaide for 1888 merged with Adelaide for the 1889 season.

On Friday 5 April 1889 At the Annual General Meeting held on Friday 5 April 1889 in the Trades Exchange with all the clubs present the United Football Association renamed itself to South Australian Football Association.

Gawler after its 4th season notified the Association in writing in April 1891 that it would no longer be joining (principally due to being given only 5 home games at Gawler and 10 away games in Adelaide for the 1890 season). In 1889 it had created its own Junior League consisting of 3 clubs. In May 1892, the Gawler Association again was affiliated with the SAFA. Subsequently, it tried to rejoin the competition a number of times but was rejected. In 1913, it was admitted but withdrew before the season started.

On 14 March 1893, at a meeting held at Temperance Hall, North Adelaide Medindie renamed itself to North Adelaide Football Club.
In March 1894, Adelaide withdrew from the Association in writing before the season commenced. This reduced the number of senior clubs to just 4 - Port Adelaide, South Adelaide, Norwood and North Adelaide (originally called Medindie).

In March 1895, a new club called Natives applied to join as the 5th Senior Club. It was formed from players from various districts and a group of former Port Adelaide players from a junior club called Port Natives. &quot;The Natives&quot; was adopted so as to prevent any feeling that it was confined to any given locality. Principally the members were drawn from the Port Natives, who were the premiers of the Adelaide and Suburban Association. After initially having their application refused. At a meeting on the 5th April 1895 the Natives then submitted a list of 50 players to show their strength. They were then admitted by 13 votes to 5 against. This new senior club would rename itself and be called West Torrens in 1897 with the introduction of the Electoral System.

In 1896, North Adelaide and the Natives were permitted to field 23 players (3 extra players).

At an Association committee meeting held on 10 August 1896, a proposal was tabled to introduce having no more than eight clubs in the association and that all clubs and any new players be zoned based on the state electoral districts. At an adjourned meeting on Monday 26 Oct 1896, South Adelaide agreed to be zoned to the Electoral of East Adelaide and delegates from the Port Natives Football Club stated they would rename and take the West Torrens District.

=== 1897–1900: Introduction of Electorate District Zoning and other Changes ===

1897 again saw a number of changes, District football based on the State Electoral Districts was introduced optionally with the aim of zoning players to a SAFA club (and became compulsory in 1899) and was the first season of football in South Australia where behinds contributed to the total score, not just goals. (which brought it in to line with the VFA).

On 5 April 1897, The Association approved the application of the current West Adelaide Football Club to join the SAFA from the Suburban Association and The Native Football Club (1895–1896) altered its name to West Torrens Football Club. Despite the constitution allowing 8 clubs based on the Electoral Districts the Association comprised six clubs until the turn of the century.

* The Gawler Club were allocated the Barossa District but continued to have its own Association - Gawler Football Association (comprising three teams based in the township)

The three newer clubs (North, West Adelaide and West Torrens) continued to struggle against the older three clubs (Norwood, Port and South Adelaide). In the First Round both West Adelaide (vs Norwood) and West Torrens (vs Port Adelaide) failed to score for the whole game. There were also a number of walkovers throughout the season when the newer clubs failed to field a team.

In 1898, the Magarey Medal was awarded to the fairest and most brilliant player for the first time.

In 1899, after a period of declining public interest in football due to the long term inequality between the three traditional clubs (Port Adelaide, South Adelaide and Norwood) and the three younger clubs (West Adelaide, West Torrens and North Adelaide), the SAFA introduced electorate football, meaning that players were allocated to clubs based on the district in which they resided. and the playing teams were reduced from 20 to 18.

At a meeting held on Monday 8 May 1899 with a large number of delegates present the Secretary was instructed to write to the Gawler and Port Pirie Associations to inform them that their applications to join the SAFA would not be entertained this year as purely electorate football was being tried.

In mid to late 1900 there was growing interest to form a senior club in the Sturt Electoral District based around Unley to join the SAFA.

In 1900, North Adelaide won the Grand Final against South Adelaide breaking the dominance of the 3 old traditional Clubs – Norwood (11), South Adelaide (8) and Port Adelaide (3) which together had won 22 of the first 23 premierships (1877–1899).

=== 1901–1913: Pre war years ===

With the introduction of Clubs being zoned to Electoral Districts South Adelaide lost the dominance it had between 1892 and 1900 (six flags and runner up three times) and was replaced by Norwood and Port Adelaide, who were joined by West Adelaide and North Adelaide; between them, the four clubs won all premierships between 1901 and 1913. West Adelaide followed three straight wooden spoons from 1904 to 1906 with four out of the five premierships from 1908 to 1912 (including Championship of Australia in 1908 and 1913), the most successful period in West Adelaide&#x27;s history.

The Constitution of the Association allowed up to eight teams based on the State&#x27;s Electoral Districts and the competition expanded to seven teams when a new football club Sturt formed by the local cricket club joined the Association in 1901 to fill the zone based on the Electoral District of Sturt, but it performed poorly initially, finishing last in its first four seasons.

In 1902, Port Adelaide adopted its now famous black and white colours.

In 1907, the association changed its name to the South Australian Football League.

In 1910 Adelaide University made an application to enter the competition as the 8th team. This led to players such as Jack Londrigan leaving league clubs such as Sturt in anticipation for a university league team. However the application was ultimately rejected by the competition out of fear a university side would compromise the electorate system, also referred to as zones, introduced to equalise the state competition.

On 2 December 1912, the Gawler Football Association was granted admission to the league to fill the zone based on the vacant 8th Electoral District Barossa. On 3 March 1913 it was confirmed the team would be called Gawler and its colors were registered as follows: Black jersey with pink hoop, white knickers and black-and-pink hose. However, just before the start of the 1913 season the association notified the league in writing that it had to withdraw due to loss of prominent players from their district and the depressed condition of the sport locally.

The University Club, the 1911 and 1912 premiers of the South Australian Amateur Football League (SAAFL), applied to fill the vacancy created by Gawler&#x27;s withdrawal but was turned down by a unanimous vote of the delegates.

=== 1914–1918: World War I years ===
The SAFL maintained competition for the first two years of World War I, 1914 and 1915, with Sturt winning their first premiership in 1915, but from 1916 the competition was suspended and did not resume until 1919. However, a league competition was formed in 1916 called South Australian Patriotic Football League by the SAFL Clubs and a number of non-AFL Clubs. The league existed for 3 seasons (1916, 1917 and 1918) and Games held were used to raise funds for the war effort. The SAFL was opposed to the formation of the Patriotic League and refused to recognise it during and after World War I.

=== 1919–1941: Inter war years ===
Sturt won the first premiership of the post-World War I era, beating North Adelaide in the Challenge Final replay after a Draw occurred in the 1919 SAFL Grand Final.

At a meeting on Monday 19 April 1920 the SAFL defined that part of Sturt district west of South Road as a new district and admitted a newly formed Glenelg to the B Grade for 1920. It became 8th club in the senior league in 1921 but started poorly with five consecutive wooden spoons.

In 1927, the South Australian Football League was renamed the South Australian National Football League.

Everyone of the 8 clubs won at least one premiership during the 9 years from 1927 to 1935, including Glenelg which their first premiership in 1934 would be the only success in their first 52 years. Prior to World War 2 Port Adelaide won three premierships in the period 1934–1939, appearing in 6 successive grand finals.

=== 1942–1945: World War II war years ===
The SANFL continued normal competition for the first few years of World War II, but from 1942 to 1944 for 3 seasons the clubs merged on a geographical basis. 
The competing teams were:
Port-Torrens (Port Adelaide and West Torrens), wearing Port Adelaide colours and known as the Magpies
Norwood-North (Norwood and North Adelaide), wearing North Adelaide colours and known as the Redlegs
Sturt-South (Sturt and South Adelaide), wearing Sturt colours and known as the Blues
West-Glenelg (West Adelaide and Glenelg), wearing Glenelg colours and known as the Tigers

=== 1946–1959: Post World War 2 and Port Adelaide 50s Dominance ===
Post World War 2 was dominated by Norwood who won 3 flags in 5 years between 1946 and 1950. Port Adelaide, led by Fos Williams, dominated the 1950s winning seven premierships, including a record setting six Grand Final wins in a row from 1954 to 1959. This record also matched Norwood&#x27;s six in a row in 1883, set before the advent of regular Grand Finals.

From early 1949 there was some discussion about expanding the competition to 10 teams due to the growth of metropolitan Adelaide and in particular adding teams from Woodville who had made an application and the outer northern Gawler and Barossa area which had a strong local league and was connected to Adelaide by the train. Previously a country team from Gawler had competed for 4 seasons from 1887 to 1890. South Adelaide were also requesting to consolidate their zone and to be potentially based at Kensington Oval.

On 20 March 1950 Salisbury Football Club made an application to join the SANFL. Applications by Burnside and Woodville were also rejected by the SANFL in June 1950.

In February 1953, The Mayor of Woodville again raised the issue of having a team admitted. Citing a large number of players from West Torrens and Port Adelaide actually resided in the City of Woodville.

In 1954, the tradition of painting the chimney of the West End brewery in Hindley Street, then owned by the South Australian Brewing Company, with the team colours of the SANFL premier and runner-up began, when a West Adelaide player and employee Clarrie Cannon suggested painting the chimney in the West Adelaide colours, red and black, as the brewery was located in their territory. General manager C. R. Aitken agreed, but only if West Adelaide was the winning team that year. However Port Adelaide coach and captain, Fos Williams, said that he expected his team to win, and the men agreed that if Port Adelaide won, their colours would be painted on the chimney. Port Adelaide won that year, so the chimney was painted in black and white vertical stripes, but Williams suggested that a red stripe be painted below the black to honour the runners-up.

=== 1959–1964: Expansion to 10 Teams ===

In 1959, after doubting whether the club was viable as a league team, the SANFL granted South Adelaide a substantial area of the newly developing southern Adelaide suburbs. Also the SANFL finally expanded to 10 teams by admitting a new club Central District based at Elizabeth in the outer north and Woodville an existing amateur league club based in the north west of metropolitan Adelaide. The newly admitted Clubs would play 5 years in the Reserves (B Grade) before joining the A Grade in 1964.

Both new clubs initially performed poorly, especially against the two strongest clubs at the time Sturt and Port Adelaide, and many questioned the purpose of introducing two more teams, in particular Woodville, who were closely surrounded by existing clubs, Port Adelaide and West Torrens and only qualified for the finals on 3 occasions throughout its history.

Central Districts qualified for the finals in 1971, 1972 finishing 3rd in both years losing in the preliminary to Port Adelaide. In 1979 they collected the minor premiership but lost both finals to again finished 3rd.

Woodville qualified for the finals for the first time in 1979 and finished in 5th. Their most successful season was 1986 in which they 3rd which was followed up by a 5th place in 1987.

===1962-1970 Port Adelaide and Sturt Domination ===

Port Adelaide continued their dominance of the competition from 1962 with three more premierships in 1962, 1963 and 1965. They would contest 7 successive Grand Finals from 1962 to 1968. Their successive premierships was broken by South Adelaide which went from wooden spooners in 1962 and 1963 to the win the Premiership in 1964 (there first since 1938) by defeating Port Adelaide. In 1965, Port Adelaide exceeded Norwood for the most premierships when they collected their 23rd Cup.

A resurgent Sturt under coach Jack Oatey won five straight premierships from 1966 to 1970, sharing a fierce rivalry with Port Adelaide whom they met in four consecutive Grand Finals from 1965–1968.

=== 1970–1979: Golden Era ===

Sturt began the 1970s by defeating Glenelg in a rain-affected Grand Final by 21 points. North Adelaide secured back-to-back premiership victories over Port Adelaide in 1971 and 1972 and defeated VFL premier Carlton by one point in the end-of-season Championship of Australia match. Glenelg won their 2nd premiership, and first since 1934, defeating North Adelaide by 7 points in 1973 in the highest scoring Grand Final 21.11 (137) to 19.16 (130). Port Adelaide continued their success, winning two premierships themselves (1977, 1979), and finishing lower than 3rd only once for the decade. Other premiership winning clubs in the 1970s were Sturt (1970, 1974, 1976), Glenelg (1973), and Norwood (1975, 1978). On 4 May 1974, Central District and North Adelaide played the first game at newly opened Football Park at West Lakes. SANFL moved its administration to the new stadium, and 58,042 attended the first Grand Final at the ground later that year, with Sturt defeating Glenelg by 15 points despite kicking into a stiff breeze in the last quarter after leading by 5 points at three-quarter time. The 1975 season was highlighted by Glenelg&#x27;s score of 49.23 (317) against Central District, with a winning margin of 238 points which was larger, at that time, than the previous highest score ever recorded by a side in a single game. In 1976, Sturt defeated Grand Final favourites Port Adelaide by 41 points in front of a record ticketed Football Park crowd of 66,897. Norwood won the 1978 premiership in their centenary year by beating Sturt in the Grand Final by one point after Sturt had lost just one game for the entire season. During the 1970s, an increasing number of SANFL players moved to Victoria to play in the VFL competition.

=== 1980–1989: VFL leaves ANFC and expands whilst SANFL struggles ===
Four clubs Port Adelaide (Premiers 1980,1981,1988,1989 RU 1984), Norwood (Premiers 1982,1984 RU 1980), North Adelaide (Premiers 1987, RU 1985, 1986 &amp; 1989) and Glenelg (Premiers 1985,1986 RU 1981,1982,1987,1988) dominated the SANFL in the 1980s, accounting for nine premierships. The only year being the exception was 1983 when West Adelaide defeated Sturt in the Grand Final for their first premiership since 1961. In the decade between 1979 and 1989 only three clubs, Central District, Woodville, both admitted to the SANFL in 1964, and West Torrens were the only clubs not to reach at least one grand final. The exodus of high quality players to the VFL accelerated in the 1980s. In this same decade only Hawthorn (1983, 1986, 1988 &amp; 1989), Carlton (1979, 1981, 1982 &amp; 1987), Richmond (1980), and Essendon 1984 &amp; 1985) were successful in the VFL. Only Collingwood (1979, 1980 &amp; 1981), Melbourne (1988) and Geelong under first year expat coach and former Woodville player Malcolm Blight (1989) would reach a VFL grand final. In 1981 the VFL rejected a SANFL bid to enter a composite South Australian team to its competition. Night football was introduced in 1984 after floodlights were installed at Football Park.The SANFL introduced a player retention scheme in 1988 in an attempt to maintain the quality of the competition in the face of falling attendances.

The tradition of painting the colours of the premier and runners-up was maintained at the Hindley Street premises of SA Brewing until its closure in 1980, before transferring to the Thebarton site, which was rebadged &quot;West End&quot;.

=== 1990–1999: Adelaide and Port Adelaide AFL entry ===

On 31 July 1990, Port Adelaide surprised the SANFL by making an independent bid to join the AFL. The SANFL was left with little option but to submit its own bid to enter the AFL. In a thirty-minute meeting the SANFL formed the Adelaide Football Club. While Port Adelaide had by far the largest supporter base in South Australia, it could not compete with the SANFL&#x27;s offer of a composite club, dismantling of the SANFL player retention scheme, dropping of court action against Port Adelaide and the use of Football Park, and in November 1990, following a legal battle (dropped), the AFL announced the Adelaide Football Club had been granted a licence and would enter the competition in 1991.

The Adelaide Football Club, nicknamed the Crows, debuted in 1991 wearing the state colours of navy blue, red and yellow. While the Adelaide Crows enjoyed crowds of over 40,000 every week and dominated local media coverage, crowds at local SANFL matches suffered substantially.

In 1994 after a tender process put to all the SANFL clubs, the Port Adelaide Football Club secured a licence to enter the AFL. Port Adelaide chose the nickname of &#x27;Power&#x27; since &#x27;Magpies&#x27; was already used by Collingwood. Port Adelaide wished to maintain its presence (as the Magpies) in the SANFL, which was agreed to on the basis that Port Adelaide&#x27;s SANFL and AFL entities operate independently. The club in the SANFL was renamed &quot;Port Adelaide Magpies Football Club&quot; to reflect this separation.

Port Adelaide dominated the SANFL in this time, contesting 10 Grand Finals in 12 years between 1988 and 1999 – winning 9 premierships (1988–1990,1992,1994–1996,1998–1999) and losing just the one Grand Final in 1997 to Norwood (their 27th Flag). This Port Adelaide dominance in the period is somewhat of an aberration. It should be kept in context with the hasty formation of the Adelaide Crows in 1991. During this period many of the remaining SANFL clubs&#x27; best players were seconded to the Adelaide Crows, whereas the Port Adelaide list was largely left intact due to the conflict that ensued around the Port Adelaide rank-breaking bid to join the expanded VFL competition as a stand-alone club. The Woodville and West Torrens Clubs merged at the end of the 1990 Season and won their first premiership in 1993 against Norwood. Between 1900 and 1999 Port Adelaide contested a total of 59 Grand Finals – winning the flag 33 times to bring their total to 36.

=== 2000–2010: Central District domination ===

There was a changing of the guard as the new century started. For more than 100 years one of Port Adelaide, Norwood, North Adelaide or Sturt appeared in every Grand Final. The year 2000 saw the two newest teams Central District and Woodville-West Torrens played off in the Grand Final. Central District appeared in 12 Consecutive Grand Finals from 2000 to 2011, collecting nine premierships (2000–2001, 2003–2005, 2007–2010). Only Sturt (2002) and Woodville-West Torrens (2006 &amp; 2011) interrupted Centrals&#x27; run during this period. Centrals played in 28 Finals games between 2000 and 2011 for a total of 25 wins (which included 12 consecutive 2nd Semi Final wins) and just 3 losses (2002,2006,2011 Grand Finals).

Under-age divisions were restructured, with under 17 and under 19 competitions dissolved in favour of under 16 and under 18 leagues, the latter coming into line with Victoria&#x27;s TAC Cup competition and under the sponsorship of McDonald&#x27;s would be known as the Macca&#x27;s Cup. The former would become the Macca&#x27;s Shield, the season length is around half that of the other levels of competition. Night games would become a feature at Elizabeth Oval, with Central District hosting Saturday night matches from 2006.

=== 2011–2019: Independence for AFL clubs; league returns to Adelaide Oval ===
Central District finished minors again in the 2011 SANFL season and defeated Norwood in the Second Semi-Final for their 12th Consecutive Grand Final appearance but suffered a narrow 3 point loss to Woodville-West Torrens, despite after outscoring the Eagles 4–4 to 1–1 in the last quarter, which brought an end to their dominance in the Grand Finals. The 2012 SANFL season saw Centrals exit the finals for the first time since 2000 without contesting in the Grand Final, this time after finishing 2nd at the end of the minor round with defeats by West Adelaide in the Qualifying and then North Adelaide in the 1st Semi-Final.

The 2012 and 2013 premierships were both won by Norwood, firstly defeating West Adelaide by 49 points to win their 28th flag and then subsequently defeating North Adelaide by 40 points for their 29th flag. This was the first time Norwood had won back to back flags for 90 years when coincidentally they also beat West Adelaide (1922) and North Adelaide (1923).
With Norwood and Elizabeth&#x27;s night match experiment largely successful and popular, West Adelaide (2010), South Adelaide (2011) and Glenelg (2012) would follow suit by installing their own lighting systems at their respective grounds while Woodville-West Torrens had hoped to play under lights at Thebarton Oval, which to date have only done so once in 2012 during their premiership defence.

In 2011, AFL-based Port Adelaide and SANFL-based Port Adelaide Magpies merged to address losses at both clubs, however, in 2013 the club announced that the Magpies would officially become the reserves team for Port&#x27;s AFL players, joining the Adelaide Football Club in fielding a reserves team in the SANFL in time for the 2014 season. These moves caused some furore in some fan circles. The 2013 Grand Final was the last SANFL match at AAMI Stadium, with SANFL league headquarters to remain at AAMI but the finals to return to the new and improved Adelaide Oval from 2014. Ahead of the 2014 season, the AFL-based Adelaide Football Club were granted a licence to field a reserve team in the competition, increasing the number of teams in the league to 10.

As a result of the Magpies becoming the Power&#x27;s reserve team, and the inclusion of the Crows reserves team in the SANFL in 2014, the other SANFL clubs will lose their AFL contracted players as those contracted to the Crows or Power will move to play exclusively for those clubs in either league. Norwood defeated arch-rivals Port Adelaide Magpies by 4 points in the 2014 Grand Final to secure their 30th Flag and 3rd in a row (2012–2014) for the first time since 1887–89.

Norwood&#x27;s dominance of the competition would end in the 2015 season, eliminated at the first week of the finals as West Adelaide ended a 32-year premiership drought with their five-goal defeat of Woodville-West Torrens in the Grand Final.

The 2016 and 2017 premierships were both won by Sturt their 14th and 15th Flags and first since 2002.

The 2018 premiership was won by North their 14th Flag and first since 1991. North Adelaide were fined $10,000 and docked four premiership points for next season but allowed to play in the Grand Final against Norwood after a controversial 5 point win in the Preliminary Final against Woodville-West Torrens when they had 19 players on the field during the early stages of the fourth quarter.

The 2019 premiership was won by Glenelg their 5th Flag and first since 1986 ending a 33-year premiership drought. This meant within the last 10 seasons 7 different clubs had won a premiership. Only the two original clubs of the competition South Adelaide (last flag in 1964) and Port Adelaide (last flag in 1999) had not won a premiership flag in at least the last 20 years (excluding the Adelaide Crows reserves team).

=== 2020–present ===
The 2020 season was originally scheduled to run from April until September; however its commencement was delayed to June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of clubs participating in the season was reduced to eight, as Adelaide Crows AFL Reserves and Port Adelaide Magpies AFL Reserves were barred from fielding their reserves teams by the Australian Football League. This is the first time in its history that Port Adelaide did not compete in the SANFL. The season was conducted with 14 rounds and a Final Four. Woodville-West Torrens defeated North Adelaide in the Grand Final. This was the last time that the top two teams&#x27; colours were painted on the West End brewery&#x27;s chimney, before that site&#x27;s closure.

The Woodville West Torrens Eagles were the 2021 SANFL Premiers, after they defeated Glenelg. The tradition of painting a chimney in the two teams&#x27; colours continues at the Hoffmann Kiln at the Brickworks Marketplace in nearby Torrensville from 2021, with the cost of the painting continuing to be borne by Lion. but the colours had to be temporarily placed on a replica chimney, as due to high winds it was deemed to unsafe to climb the chimney on the day of the ceremony.

== League administration ==
The league&#x27;s revenue is derived from its paid attendance, media and payments from both the Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide AFL clubs for use of Adelaide Oval.

The SANFL is classed as a semi-professional competition. In 2008 the league had a salary cap of $400,000 (excluding service payments). This is the second highest in Australia for an Australian rules football competition, after the AFL.

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the SANFL is Darren Chandler, who replaced Jake Parkinson in the role in 2020.

==SANFL Ladder==
South Australian leagues (including the SANFL) award two points for a win, and one for a draw. Elsewhere in Australia generally four points are awarded for a win and two for a draw. In addition, percentage is calculated as &quot;For&quot; ÷ &quot;For and Against&quot; × &quot;100&quot;. Elsewhere in Australia it is generally calculated as &quot;For&quot; ÷ &quot;Against&quot; × &quot;100&quot;.

== Audience ==
The SANFL match-day program is called the &quot;South Australian Football Budget/Football Budget&quot; and is sold at all SANFL matches. A special edition is produced for the grand final.

The SANFL competition&#x27;s &quot;match of the round&quot; was broadcast weekly in South Australia on ABC Southern (ABC1 South Australia). Until early 2008, it was also broadcast nationally on ABC2 television. In 2012, nationwide SANFL match replays resumed on ABC2. Match replays are also available nationally on ABC iView. In 2007, the SANFL measured a record 1,415,000 total television viewers.

The SANFL competition is covered by local radio stations Life FM (live) and 5RPH (live). ABC Local Radio and 5AA broadcast the SANFL Finals Series.

In 2013, the SANFL signed a three-year deal with the Seven Network to broadcast weekly matches on 7mate from the start of the 2014 season. Popular Mix102.3 radio host and Seven News Adelaide sports presenter Mark Soderstrom, former Port Adelaide Magpies captain and 5AA breakfast show personality Tim Ginevar, and former Fox Sports commentator John Casey (who spent time with Seven Adelaide during the 1980s and 1990s) would be the chief callers for the 2014 SANFL season.This marks the leagues return to commercial television for the first time since Channel 9 broadcast the SANFL in 1992.

===Attendance===
Although SANFL crowds now competes heavily with the two AFL national league clubs, the SANFL still has the second highest attendance of any Australian rules football league and the highest attendance for any regional league of any football code. It continues to publish attendance figures.

The record attendance for an SANFL fixture was set at the 1976 SANFL Grand Final between Sturt and Port Adelaide at Football Park which saw 66,987 crammed into the stadium, though some estimate the crowd to have been as high as 80,000 with thousands turned away at the gates. The largest attendance for a minor round fixture was set in Round 19, 1988 for a double header at Football Park. 38,213 fans saw Sturt play Port Adelaide in the early game while reigning premiers North Adelaide faced ladder leaders Central District in the late game. The record suburban ground attendance was an estimated 24,000 who saw Sturt and Norwood at Unley Oval on 9 June 1924. A verified attendance of 22,738 saw Port play Norwood at Alberton in Round 11, 1977*.

The following are attendance figures since 1991.

=== Club ===
The Grand Final winners each season are presented the Thomas Seymour Hill Premiership Trophy, named after administrator Thomas Seymour Hill.

The Stanley H. Lewis Memorial Trophy, awarded annually since 1962, recognises the best combined record in all levels of SANFL competition. The trophy is awarded to the best performed club across five grades of the competition – Men&#x27;s League, Women&#x27;s League, Reserves, Under 18 and Under 16, with 100 points allocated for a men&#x27;s league win, 100 points for a women&#x27;s league win, 50 points for a reserves win, 50 points for an Under 18 win, and 25 points for an Under 16 win. In the event of a draw, half of the points allocated for a win in that grade are awarded to each club involved. Prior to the creation of the women&#x27;s league, the trophy was awarded on the basis of performances in the men&#x27;s league, reserves league and under-18 league.

=== Individual ===

The Magarey Medal is awarded to the fairest and most brilliant player in the SANFL each season and is the oldest individual football award in Australia.

The medal was originated by and is named after William Ashley Magarey who, in 1897, was the inaugural chairman of the South Australian Football Association (as the SANFL was then known). In 1898, in an effort to stamp out rough play and improve respect of umpires, Magarey instituted the medal to be awarded to the player deemed by umpires to be the fairest and most brilliant for that season. The inaugural winner of the medal was Norwood&#x27;s Alby Green. Magarey presented every medal until he died in 1929, with West Adelaide&#x27;s Robert Snell the last to receive the medal during Magarey&#x27;s life. The Magarey Medal is still awarded to the fairest and most brilliant SANFL player each season. The Reserves Magarey Medal recognises the standout performers in the seconds or Reserves. It is not unusual for the Reserves Magarey winner to play only half a season in the &#x27;seconds&#x27; and the rest of the season in their club&#x27;s league team.

The Ken Farmer Medal, much like the Coleman Medal in the AFL, is awarded to the league player with the most goals in a season. Named after North Adelaide and South Australia&#x27;s most prolific goal-kicker Ken Farmer who ended his SANFL career with a still record 1,417 goals, the medal was introduced in 1981 after Farmer&#x27;s death, with Port Adelaide&#x27;s Tim Evans winning the inaugural award; Evans kicked 993 goals in premiership matches for the Magpies between 1975 and 1986.

There are also the McCallum and Tomkins Medals, which up until the 2008 season were awarded to the best and fairest players of the U-17 and U-19 divisions respectively. These awards were merged in 2009 when the two under-age competitions were replaced with an U-18&#x27;s league, similar to those adopted in the West Australian Football League and the VFL&#x27;s TAC Cup. The first winner of the newly created McCallum-Tomkins Medal was South Adelaide&#x27;s Luke Bowd.

The Jack Oatey Medal is awarded to the player voted best on ground in the SANFL Grand Final, first awarded in the 1981 premiership decider to Russell Ebert of Port Adelaide. In the same year, the Fos Williams Medal was also commissioned to recognise the standout performer for South Australia in interstate football, the first of which was awarded to Peter Carey of Glenelg.

Despite State of Origin football being dropped from the AFL calendar after 1999, the medal continues to be awarded to the best player for the SANFL representative team in interstate football.

The R.O. Shearman Medal, since its inception in 2000, is awarded to the player voted by the League&#x27;s senior coaches on a 5–4–3–2–1 basis each game of the home-and-away season.

The Bob Quinn Medal is awarded to the player voted best afield in the Anzac Day matches between the Grand Finalists of the previous year. Commissioned in 2002, the medal was first won by James Gowans of Central District.

Also in 2002, the SANFL created the South Australian Football Hall of Fame to recognise the players, coaches, umpires, administrators and journalists who had made a significant contribution in the SANFL. The inaugural class of 2002 saw 113 inductees into the Hall of Fame and included such greats as Russell Ebert, Ken Farmer, Barrie Robran, Malcolm Blight, Fos Williams, Brian Faehse, Lindsay Head, Neil Kerley, Rick Davies and Jack Oatey.

==SANFL Women&#x27;s==

In February 2017, the SANFL followed the example of VFL Women&#x27;s in Victoria, and created a state-based women&#x27;s Australian rules football competition replicating its men&#x27;s league. The SANFLW expanded over the following two years, and is now played by eight of the SANFL clubs between February and May, with Adelaide and Port Adelaide not participating.

Due to the timing of the league, most SANFLW players are not contracted to clubs in the semi-professional AFL Women&#x27;s national competition. Glenelg are the current league premiers.

==Other SANFL competitions==
Aside from the senior SANFL competition, the league has operated a reserves competition since 1919 (such a competition has existed since 1906), and has also operated four underage competitions. Under-19s and Under-17s competitions were run from 1937 and 1939 respectively until 2008, when the league merged these competitions to form the Under-18s competition (initially known as the Maccas Cup) from 2009, and it introduced an Under-16s competition the following year.

Neither Adelaide nor Port Adelaide field teams in these competitions: Adelaide has elected not to field teams, while Port Adelaide previously did, but shut down their underage teams in 2014 and their reserves team in 2018.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm von Giesebrecht (5 March 1814 – 17 December 1889) was a German historian.

He was born in Berlin, the son of Karl Giesebrecht (died 1832), and a nephew of the poet Ludwig Giesebrecht (1792–1873).

He studied under Leopold von Ranke, and his first important work, &quot;Geschichte Ottos II.&quot;, was contributed to Ranke&#x27;s &quot;Jahrbücher des deutschen Reichs unter dem sächsischen Hause&quot; (Berlin, 1837–1840). In 1841 he published his &quot;Jahrbücher des Klosters Altaich&quot;, a reconstruction of the lost &quot;Annales Altahenses&quot;, a medieval source of which fragments only were known to be extant, and these were obscured in other chronicles. The brilliance of this performance was shown in 1867, when a copy of the original chronicle was found, and it was seen that Giesebrecht&#x27;s text was substantially correct.

In the meantime he had been appointed &quot;Oberlehrer&quot; in the Joachimsthaler Gymnasium in Berlin; had paid a visit to Italy, and as a result of his researches there had published &quot;De litterarum studiis apud halos primis mediiaevi seculis&quot; (Berlin, 1845), a study upon the survival of culture in Italian cities during the Middle Ages, and also several critical essays upon the sources for the early history of the popes. In 1851 appeared his translation of the &quot;Historiae of Gregory of Tours&quot;, which is the standard German translation.

Four years later appeared the first volume of his great work, &quot;Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit&quot;, the fifth volume of which was published in 1888. This work was the first in which the results of the scientific methods of research were thrown open to the world at large. Largeness of style and brilliance of portrayal were joined to an absolute mastery of the sources in a way hitherto unachieved by any German historian.

Giesebrecht&#x27;s history appeared when the new German empire was in the making, and became popular owing both to its patriotic tone and its intrinsic merits. In 1857 he went to Königsberg as professor ordinarius, and in 1862 succeeded Heinrich von Sybel as professor of history in the University of Munich. The Bavarian government honoured him in various ways, and he died at Munich on 17 December 1889.

In addition to the works already mentioned, Giesebrecht published a good monograph on Arnold of Brescia (Munich, 1873), a collection of essays under the title &quot;Deutsche Reden&quot; (Munich, 1881), and was an active member of the group of scholars who took over the direction of the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae historica&quot; in 1875. In 1895 Bernhard von Simson added a sixth volume to the &quot;Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit&quot;, thus bringing the work down to the death of Emperor Frederick I in 1190.

<text>Torgau-Oschatz is a former district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the district Wittenberg in Saxony-Anhalt, the district Elbe-Elster in Brandenburg, and the districts Riesa-Großenhain, Döbeln, Muldentalkreis and Delitzsch.

== History ==
The district was created in 1994 by merging the two previous districts Oschatz and Torgau, and 6 municipalities from the former district Eilenburg. In August 2008, as a part of the district reform in Saxony, the districts of Delitzsch and Torgau-Oschatz were merged into the new district Nordsachsen.

== Geography ==
The main river in the district is the Elbe, which meanders through water meadows. The landscape is dominated by three heath areas, the &quot;Dahlener Heide&quot; (150 km2) in the south, the Düben Heath (110 km2) in the northwest, and partially the &quot;Annaburger Heide&quot; in the east.

<text>Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Yasar al-Muttalibi (; –767), known simply as Ibn Ishaq, was an 8th-century Muslim historian and hagiographer. 

Ibn Ishaq, also known by the title , collected oral traditions that formed the basis of an important biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. His biography is known as the &quot;Al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah&quot;, and it has mainly survived through the recension of the work by Ibn Hisham.

==Life==
Born in Medina circa A.H. 85 (A.D. 704), ibn Isḥaq&#x27;s grandfather was Yasār ibn Khiyar (according to some ibn Khabbar, Kuman or Kutan), one of forty Christian or Jewish boys who had been held captive in a monastery at Ayn al-Tamr. After being found in one of Khalid ibn al-Walid&#x27;s campaigns, Yasār was taken to Medina and enslaved to Qays ibn Makhrama ibn al-Muṭṭalib ibn ʿAbd Manāf ibn Quṣayy. On his conversion to Islam, he was manumitted as &quot;mawlā&quot; (client), thus acquiring the surname, or &quot;nisbat&quot;, al-Muṭṭalibī. His three sons, Mūsā, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, and Isḥāq, were transmitters of &quot;akhbār&quot;, i.e. they collected and recounted written and oral testaments of the past. Isḥāq married the daughter of another mawlā and from this marriage Ibn Isḥāq was born.

No facts of Ibn Isḥāq&#x27;s early life are known, but it is likely that he followed in the family tradition of transmission of early akhbār and hadith. He was influenced by the work of ibn Shihab al-Zuhri, who praised the young ibn Ishaq for his knowledge of &quot;maghāzī&quot; (stories of military expeditions). Around the age of 30, ibn Isḥaq arrived in Alexandria and studied under Yazīd ibn Abī Ḥabīb. After his return to Medina, based on one account, he was ordered out of Medina for attributing a hadith to a woman he had not met, Fāṭima bint al-Mundhir, the wife of Hishām ibn ʿUrwa. But those who defended him, like Sufyan ibn ʽUyaynah, stated that Ibn Ishaq told them that he did meet her. Also ibn Ishaq disputed with the young Malik ibn Anas, famous for the Maliki School of Fiqh. Leaving Medina (or forced to leave), he traveled eastwards towards &quot;al-Irāq&quot;, stopping in Kufa, also al-Jazīra, and into Iran as far as Ray, before returning west. Eventually he settled in Baghdad. There, the new Abbasid dynasty, having overthrown the Umayyad dynasty, was establishing a new capital.

Ibn Isḥaq moved to the capital and found patrons in the new regime. He became a tutor employed by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mansur, who commissioned him to write an all-encompassing history book starting from the creation of Adam to the present day, known as &quot;al-Mubtadaʾ wa al-Baʿth wa al-Maghāzī&quot; (lit. &quot;In the Beginning, the mission [of Muhammad], and the expeditions&quot;). It was kept in the court library of Baghdad. Part of this work contains the &quot;Sîrah&quot; or biography of the Prophet, the rest was once considered a lost work, but substantial fragments of it survive. He died in Baghdad in A.H. 150.

== Biography of Muhammad (&quot;Sīrat Rasūl Allāh&quot;) ==

===Original versions, survival===
Ibn Isḥaq collected oral traditions about the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. These traditions, which he orally dictated to his pupils, are now known collectively as &quot;Sīratu Rasūli l-Lāh&quot; ( &quot;Life of the Messenger of God&quot;) and survive mainly in the following sources:

* An edited copy, or recension, of his work by his student al-Bakka&#x27;i, which was further edited by ibn Hisham. Al-Bakka&#x27;i&#x27;s work has perished and only ibn Hisham&#x27;s has survived, in copies. Ibn Hisham edited out of his work &quot;things which it is disgraceful to discuss; matters which would distress certain people; and such reports as al-Bakka&#x27;i told me he could not accept as trustworthy.&quot;
* An edited copy, or recension, prepared by his student Salamah ibn Fadl al-Ansari. This also has perished, and survives only in the copious extracts to be found in the voluminous &quot;History of the Prophets and Kings&quot; by Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari.
* Fragments of several other recensions. Guillaume lists them on p. xxx of his preface, but regards most of them as so fragmentary as to be of little worth.

According to Donner, the material in ibn Hisham and al-Tabari is &quot;virtually the same&quot;. However, there is some material to be found in al-Tabari that was not preserved by ibn Hisham. For example, al-Tabari includes the controversial episode of the Satanic Verses, while ibn Hisham does not.

Following the publication of previously unknown fragments of ibn Isḥaq&#x27;s traditions, recent scholarship suggests that ibn Isḥaq did not commit to writing any of the traditions now extant, but they were narrated orally to his transmitters. These new texts, found in accounts by Salama al-Ḥarranī and Yūnus ibn Bukayr, were hitherto unknown and contain versions different from those found in other works.

====Reconstruction of the text by Guillaume====

The original text of the &quot;Sīrat Rasūl Allāh&quot; by Ibn Ishaq did not survive. However, much of the original text was copied over into a work of his own by Ibn Hisham (Basra; Fustat, died 833 AD, 218 AH).

Ibn Hisham also &quot;abbreviated, annotated, and sometimes altered&quot; the text of Ibn Ishaq, according to Guillaume (at p. xvii). Interpolations made by Ibn Hisham are said to be recognizable and can be deleted, leaving as a remainder, a so-called &quot;edited&quot; version of Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s original text (otherwise lost). In addition, Guillaume (at p. xxxi) points out that Ibn Hisham&#x27;s version &quot;omits&quot; various narratives in the text which were given by al-Tabari in his &quot;History&quot;. In these passages al-Tabari expressly cites Ibn Ishaq as a source.

Thus can be reconstructed an &#x27;improved&#x27; &quot;edited&quot; text, i.e., by distinguishing or removing Ibn Hisham&#x27;s additions, and by adding from al-Tabari passages attributed to Ibn Ishaq. Yet the result&#x27;s degree of approximation to Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s original text can only be conjectured. Such a reconstruction is available, e.g., in Guillaume&#x27;s translation. Here, Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s introductory chapters describe pre-Islamic Arabia, before he then commences with the narratives surrounding the life of Muhammad (in Guillaume at pp. 109–690).

=== Reception ===

Notable scholars like the jurist Ahmad ibn Hanbal appreciated his efforts in collecting sīra narratives and accepted him on maghāzī, despite having reservations on his methods on matters of fiqh. Ibn Ishaq also influenced later sīra writers like Ibn Hishām and Ibn Sayyid al-Nās. Other scholars, like Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya, made use of his chronological ordering of events.

The most widely discussed criticism of his sīra was that of his contemporary Mālik ibn Anas. Mālik rejected the stories of Muhammad and the Jews of Medina on the ground that they were taken solely based on accounts by sons of Jewish converts. These same stories have also been denounced as &quot;odd tales&quot; (gharāʾib) later by ibn Hajar al-Asqalani. Mālik and others also thought that ibn Isḥāq exhibited Qadari tendencies, had a preference for Ali (Guillaume also found evidence of this, pp. xxii &amp;xxiv), and relied too heavily on what were later called the Isrā&#x27;īlīyāt. Furthermore, early literary critics, like ibn Sallām al-Jumaḥī and ibn al-Nadīm, censured ibn Isḥāq for knowingly including forged poems in his biography, and for attributing poems to persons not known to have written any poetry. The 14th-century historian al-Dhahabī, using hadith terminology, noted that in addition to the forged (&quot;makdhūb&quot;) poetry, Ibn Isḥāq filled his sīra with munqaṭiʿ (broken chain of narration) and munkar (suspect narrator) reports.

Guillaume notices that Ibn Isḥāq frequently uses a number of expressions to convey his skepticism or caution. Beside a frequent note that only God knows whether a particular statement is true or not (p. xix), Guillaume suggests that Ibn Isḥāq deliberately substitutes the ordinary term &quot;ḥaddathanī&quot; (he narrated to me) by a word of suspicion &quot;zaʿama&quot; (&quot;he alleged&quot;) to show his skepticism about certain traditions (p. xx).

Michael Cook laments that comparing Ibn Ishaq with the later commentator Al-Waqidi — who based his writing on Ibn Ishaq but added much colorful but made-up detail — reveals how oral history can be contaminated by the fiction of storytellers (&quot;qussa&quot;). &quot;We have seen what half a century of story-telling could achieve between Ibn Ishaq and al-Waqidi, at a time when we know that much material had already been committed to writing. What the same processes may have brought about in the century before Ibn Ishaq is something we can only guess at.&quot;

Cook&#x27;s fellow revisionist Patricia Crone complains that &quot;Sīrat&quot; is full of &quot;contradictions, confusions, inconsistencies and anomalies,&quot; written &quot;not by a grandchild, but a great grandchild of the Prophet&#x27;s generation&quot;, that it is written from the point of view of the ulama and Abbasid, so that &quot;we shall never know ... how the Umayyad caliphs remembered their prophet&quot;.

===Translations===

In 1864 the Heidelberg professor Gustav Weil published an annotated German translation in two volumes. Several decades later the Hungarian scholar Edward Rehatsek prepared an English translation, but it was not published until over a half-century later.

The best-known translation in a Western language is Alfred Guillaume&#x27;s 1955 English translation, but some have questioned the reliability of this translation. In it Guillaume combined ibn Hisham and those materials in al-Tabari cited as ibn Isḥaq&#x27;s whenever they differed or added to ibn Hisham, believing that in so doing he was restoring a lost work. The extracts from al-Tabari are clearly marked, although sometimes it is difficult to distinguish them from the main text (only a capital &quot;T&quot; is used).

==Other works==
Ibn Isḥaq wrote several works. His major work is &quot;al-Mubtadaʾ wa al-Baʿth wa al-Maghāzī&quot;—the &quot;Kitab al-Mubtada&quot; and &quot;Kitab al-Mab&#x27;ath&quot; both survive in part, particularly &quot;al-Mab&#x27;ath&quot;, and &quot;al-Mubtada&quot; otherwise in substantial fragments. He is also credited with the lost works &quot;Kitāb al-kh̲ulafāʾ&quot;, which al-Umawwī related to him (Fihrist, 92; Udabāʾ, VI, 401) and a book of &quot;Sunan&quot; (Ḥād̲j̲d̲j̲ī Ḵh̲alīfa, II, 1008).

==Reliability of his hadith==

In hadith studies, ibn Isḥaq&#x27;s hadith (considered separately from his prophetic biography) is generally thought to be &quot;good&quot; (&quot;ḥasan&quot;) (assuming an accurate and trustworthy isnad, or chain of transmission) and himself having a reputation of being &quot;sincere&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; (&quot;ṣadūq&quot;). However, a general analysis of his isnads has given him the negative distinction of being a &quot;mudallis&quot;, meaning one who did not name his teacher, claiming instead to narrate directly from his teacher&#x27;s teacher.

Others, like Ahmad ibn Hanbal, rejected his narrations on all matters related to fiqh. Al-Dhahabī concluded that the soundness of his narrations regarding ahadith is &quot;hasan&quot;, except in hadith where he is the sole transmitter which should probably be considered as &quot;munkar&quot;. He added that some Imams mentioned him, including Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, who cited five of Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s ahadith in his &quot;Sahih&quot;.

<doc id="344730" wikidata="Q2000359" url="?curid=344730" title="North American Baptist Conference">
<text>North American Baptist Conference (NAB) is a Baptist Christian denomination in the United States and in Canada. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is in Roseville, California.

==History==
The roots of the NAB go back to 1839, when Konrad Anton Fleischmann began work in New Jersey and Pennsylvania with German immigrants. Fleischmann was a Swiss separatist and held to believer&#x27;s baptism and regenerate church membership. In 1843, the first German Baptist Church was organized in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This was the oldest church affiliated with the &quot;North American Baptist Conference&quot;. German Baptist Churches were organized in Illinois, Missouri, New York, Ontario, and Wisconsin in the 1840s and early 1850s. The churches organized a conference in 1851 in Philadelphia, named the &quot;Conference of Ministers and Helpers of German Churches of Baptized Christians, usually called Baptists.&quot; Another conference was formed in 1859 in Springfield, Illinois. The first German Baptist church in Canada was established by August Rauschenbusch in Ontario in 1851. The &quot;General Conference of German Baptist Churches in North America&quot; was formed in 1865 at Wilmot, Ontario, and meets every three years for fellowship and to conduct business. The Conference has changed from originally being German-language churches to primarily using the English language. The Conference adopted its present title in 1944, removing the reference to its ethnic identity. In 1970 the form of organization of the North American Baptist Conference was restructured into 21 smaller units called &quot;Associations.&quot;

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 53,000 members and 405 churches. 

==Schools==
It has two schools - the Kairos University in Sioux Falls, South Dakota in the United States and Taylor College and Seminary in Edmonton, Alberta in Canada.

<doc id="344731" wikidata="Q485005" url="?curid=344731" title="Analog multiplier">
<text>In electronics, an analog multiplier is a device that takes two analog signals and produces an output which is their product. Such circuits can be used to implement related functions such as &quot;squares&quot; (apply same signal to both inputs), and &quot;square roots&quot;.

An electronic analog multiplier can be called by several names, depending on the function it is used to serve (see analog multiplier applications).

== Voltage-controlled amplifier versus analog multiplier ==
If one input of an analog multiplier is held at a steady-state voltage, a signal at the second input will be scaled in proportion to the level on the fixed input. In this case, the analog multiplier may be considered to be a voltage controlled amplifier. Obvious applications would be for electronic volume control and automatic gain control (AGC). Although analog multipliers are often used for such applications, voltage-controlled amplifiers are not necessarily true analog multipliers. For example, an integrated circuit designed to be used as a volume control may have a signal input designed for 1 Vp-p, and a control input designed for 0-5 V dc; that is, the two inputs are not symmetrical and the control input will have a limited bandwidth.

By contrast, in what is generally considered to be a &quot;true&quot; analog multiplier, the two signal inputs have identical characteristics. Applications specific to a true analog multiplier are those where both inputs are signals, for example in a frequency mixer or an analog circuit to implement a discrete Fourier transform. Due to the precision required for the device to be accurate and linear over the input range a true analog multiplier is generally a much more expensive part than a voltage-controlled amplifier.

A four-quadrant multiplier is one where inputs and outputs may swing positive and negative. Many multipliers only work in 2 quadrants (one input may only have one polarity), or single quadrant (inputs and outputs have only one polarity, usually all positive).

== Analog multiplier devices ==
Analog multiplication can be accomplished by using the Hall effect.

The Gilbert cell is a circuit whose output current is a 4 quadrant multiplication of its two differential inputs.

Integrated circuits analog multipliers are incorporated into many applications, such as a true RMS converter, but a number of general purpose analog multiplier &quot;building blocks&quot; are available such as the Linear Four Quadrant Multiplier. General-purpose devices will usually include attenuators or amplifiers on the inputs or outputs in order to allow the signal to be scaled within the voltage limits of the circuit.

Although analog multiplier circuits are very similar to operational amplifiers, they are far more susceptible to noise and offset voltage-related problems as these errors may become multiplied. When dealing with high-frequency signals, phase-related problems may be quite complex. For this reason, manufacturing wide-range general-purpose analog multipliers is far more difficult than ordinary operational amplifiers, and such devices are typically produced using specialist technologies and laser trimming, as are those used for high-performance amplifiers such as instrumentation amplifiers. This means they have a relatively high cost and so they are generally used only for circuits where they are indispensable.

Some commonly available Analog Multiplier ICs in the market are MPY634 from Texas Instruments, AD534, AD632 and AD734 from Analog Devices, HA-2556 from Intersil and many more from other IC manufacturers.

== Analog versus digital tradeoff in multiplication ==
In most cases, the functions performed by an analog multiplier may be performed better and at lower cost using digital signal processing techniques. At low frequencies, a digital solution is cheaper and more effective and allows the circuit function to be modified in firmware. As frequencies rise, the cost of implementing digital solutions increases much more steeply than for analog solutions. As digital technology advances, the use of analog multipliers tends to be ever more marginalized towards higher-frequency circuits or very specialized applications.

In addition, most &quot;signals&quot; are now destined to become digitized sooner or later in the signal path, and if at all possible the functions that would require a multiplier tend to be moved to the digital side. For example, in early digital multimeters, true RMS functions were provided by external analog multiplier circuits. Nowadays (with the exception of high-frequency measurements) the tendency is to increase the sampling rate of the ADC in order to digitize the input signal allowing RMS and a whole range of other functions to be carried out by a digital processor. However, blindly digitizing the signal as early in the signal path as possible costs unreasonable amounts of power due to the need for high-speed ADCs. A much more efficient solution involves analog preprocessing to condition the signal and reduce its bandwidth so that energy is spent to digitize only the bandwidth that contains useful information.

In addition, digitally controlled resistors allow microcontrollers to implement many functions such as tone control and AGC without having to process the digitized signal directly.

<doc id="344757" wikidata="Q242932" url="?curid=344757" title="Nonthaburi province">
<text>Nonthaburi is one of the central provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand, established by the , which came into force on 9 May 1946 (Thursday).

Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Pathum Thani, Bangkok, and Nakhon Pathom. Nonthaburi is the most densely populated province after Bangkok. The Bang Kwang Central Prison is in the province.

==Geography==
Nonthaburi is directly northwest of Bangkok on the Chao Phraya River. The province is part of the greater Bangkok Metropolitan Area. In most parts it is as urbanized as the capital, and the boundary between the two provinces is nearly unrecognizable. There is no forest area in the province.

==History==
Nonthaburi was declared a city in the middle of the 16th century. It was previously a village named Talat Khwan. During the reign of King Prasat Thong, a canal was dug to create a shortcut for the flow of the Chao Phraya. The river changed its flow into the new canal, which is still the riverbed today. In 1665 King Narai built a fortress, as the shorter river course was giving enemies an easier route to the capital, Ayutthaya. The town was then moved near the fortress.

From 1943 to 1946 the province was incorporated into Bangkok.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows earthenware, a traditional product of Nonthaburi. The provincial tree and flower is the yellow flame tree (&quot;Peltophorum pterocarpum&quot;). Nonthaburi is a province where the Chao Phraya River crosses from north to south, and on the ground, the Chao Phraya giant catfish (&quot;Pangasius sanitwongsei&quot;) is the provincial aquatic life.

The provincial slogan translates to &quot;Grand royal mansion, renowned Suan Somdet, Ko Kret&#x27;s pottery, famous ancient temples, tasty durians, and the beautiful government office&quot;. The royal mansion refers to Phra Tamnak Nonthaburi in Mueang Nonthaburi District, the former residence of Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. Princess Mother Srinagarindra Garden (Suan Somdet) is a water garden with a statue of princess Srinagarindra in the Pak Kret District. The provincial administration building once received an award as the most beautiful such building by the Ministry of Interior.

==Agriculture==
Nonthaburi province is renowned for growing the best durians in the country. Durian has been a well-known fruit in this province for 400 years. The fruit is known as &quot;Durian Non&quot; which means durian from Nonthaburi province. It is also known as the most expensive durian in the world. There are six groups of Nonthaburi durian which are Kop, Luang, Kan Yao, Kampan, Thong Yoi, and miscellaneous. Most durian orchards are near rivers such as the Chao Phraya. This is because the soil next to the river is good for planting which is also good for durian trees. Many durian orchards have disappeared due to flooding and pollution. The price of durian Non depends on its group. Kan Yao is the most expensive, starting from around 10,000 baht up to 20,000 baht (or about US$600) for one durian. The Kan Yao itself is not easy to find in normal markets. The main reason for the high price is because it is rare. The recent flood in 2011 cleared out almost all of the durian trees in Nonthaburi, and only a few trees have been newly planted. Also, residential areas are expanding into agricultural areas.

== Health ==
Nonthaburi&#x27;s main hospital operated by the Ministry of Public Health is Phra Nang Klao Hospital. It is also the location of the largest psychiatric hospital in Thailand- Srithanya Hospital.

==Religion==

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
The province is divided into six districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;).The districts are further subdivided into 52 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 433 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

#Mueang Nonthaburi
#Bang Kruai
#Bang Yai
#Bang Bua Thong
#Sai Noi
#Pak Kret
===Local government===
As of 8 September 2020 there are: one Nonthaburi Provincial Administrative Organization - PAO (&quot;&quot;) and twenty-two municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. The capital Nonthaburi and Pak Kret have city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Further ten have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status and ten subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;).


The non-municipal areas are administered by 23 Subdistrict Administrative&lt;br&gt;
Organizations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).
==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<text>Rainbow Bridge is a natural arch in southern Utah, United States. With a span of , as reported in 1974 by the Bureau of Reclamation, and height of , it is one of the largest natural arches in the world. At the top it is thick and wide. The bridge, which is of cultural importance to a number of area Native American tribes, has been designated a Traditional Cultural Property by the National Park Service. Rainbow Bridge National Monument was protected in 1910, and it is administered by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.

==History==

Located in the rugged, isolated canyons at the feet of Navajo Mountain, Rainbow Bridge was known for centuries by the Native Americans who have long held the bridge sacred. Ancient Pueblo People were followed much later by Paiute and Navajo groups who named the bridge &quot;Nonnezoshe&quot; or &quot;rainbow turned to stone.&quot; Several Native American families still reside nearby.

By the 1800s, Rainbow Bridge was probably seen by wandering trappers, prospectors, and cowboys. Not until 1909, though, was its existence publicized to the outside world. Two separate exploration parties—one headed by University of Utah Dean Byron Cummings, and another by government surveyor, W.B. Douglass—began searching for the legendary span. Eventually, they combined efforts. Paiute guides Nasja Begay and Jim Mike led the way, along with trader and explorer John Wetherill. Late in the afternoon of August 15, coming down what is now Bridge Canyon, the party saw Rainbow Bridge for the first time.

The next year, on May 30, 1910, U.S. President William Howard Taft used presidential proclamation to designate Rainbow Bridge National Monument. Teddy Roosevelt and Zane Grey were among the first visitors to make the trek by foot and horseback from Oljeto or Navajo Mountain. In 1924 S.I. and Hubert Richardson built a road north from Red Lake (Tonalea) to the west side of Navajo Mountain, where they built a rustic stone building and facilities for mules and visitors, calling it Rainbow Lodge. They established a trail from the lodge to Cliff Canyon, then over Redbud Pass to Bridge Canyon. The 14-mile trip from the lodge to Rainbow Bridge could be made in one day by mule or horse. Bill and Catherine Wilson operated the lodge from 1928 to 1951, except for the World War II years. In 1942 Barry Goldwater (later US Senator and presidential candidate) acquired a half interest in the lodge. The main building at the site burned in August 1951. Merritt and Winona Holloway operated the lodge in 1952, using a garage building as a dining hall. Miles Headrick conducted some trips from the lodge site for the next few years, before the site was abandoned. The site is now the trailhead for hikers to the bridge. Due to erosion, Redbud Pass is no longer passable for horses.

Rainbow Bridge became more accessible with the popularity of river running in Glen Canyon after World War II, although the trip still required several days floating the Colorado River plus a six-mile hike up-canyon. By the early 1950s, people could travel upstream by jet boat from Lee&#x27;s Ferry. Glen Canyon Dam was authorized in 1956. By 1963, the gates on the dam closed and rising Lake Powell began to engulf the river and its side canyons. Higher water made motorboat access to Rainbow Bridge much easier, bringing thousands of visitors each year.

In 1974, Navajo tribal members who lived in the history of Rainbow Bridge filed suit in U.S. District Court against the Secretary of the Interior, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Director of the National Park Service. The suit was an attempt to preserve important Navajo religious sites that were being inundated by the rising waters of Lake Powell. The court ruled against the Navajo, saying that the need for water storage outweighed their concerns. In 1980, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that to close Rainbow Bridge, a public site, for Navajo religious ceremonies would violate the U.S. Constitution which protects the religious freedom of all citizens.

By 1993, a National Park Service General Management Plan, involving much public input, was adopted. As part of the planning process, the National Park Service consulted with the five Native American nations affiliated with Rainbow Bridge: the Navajo, Hopi, San Juan Southern Paiute, Kaibab Paiute, and White Mesa Ute. Chief among their concerns was that Rainbow Bridge—a religious and sacred place—be protected and visited in a respectful manner. Additionally, the tribes expressed concerns about visitors approaching or walking under the bridge. Today, the National Park Service asks visitors to be respectful of its significance to the people who have long held Rainbow Bridge sacred. It is not illegal, however, for visitors to approach and walk under the bridge from one side to the other along or just above the creek bed, and there is a well-worn path under the bridge that is regularly used.

==Geology==

Rainbow Bridge is made up of sandstone originally deposited by wind as sand dunes during the end of the Triassic and the Jurassic periods. The bridge lintel consists of Navajo Sandstone while Bridge Creek incises the Kayenta Formation below. Extreme fluctuations in climate during the Triassic and Jurassic periods—the region was alternately a sea and desert on par with the Sahara—produced layers of sandstone with different levels of hardness. By the end of the Jurassic, the sea returned to cover these layers of sandstone and compressed them so tightly that they would persist until the present day.

As Bridge Creek flowed toward the growing Colorado River during the last ice age, it carved first through softer rocks and veered away from the harder Triassic and Jurassic sandstones, eventually creating a wide hairpin bend that flowed around a solid &quot;fin&quot; of sandstone that would become Rainbow Bridge. The previous course of the creek is still visible above the bridge. Water flows back on itself at bends and wide spots, creating swirling eddies along the banks. As the creek flowed around Rainbow Bridge fin, these abrasive eddies formed on both the upstream and downstream sides and cut circular alcoves in the rock wall. The sediment in the creek eventually scoured the softer layers of sandstone away, leaving the harder layers behind.

==Access==
Rainbow Bridge is one of the most accessible of the large arches of the world. It can be reached by a two-hour boat ride on Lake Powell from either of two marinas near Page, Arizona, followed by a mile-long walk (variable depending on Lake Powell water level) from the National Park wharf in Bridge Canyon. It is also possible to hike one or more days overland from a trailhead on the southwest side of Navajo Mountain (former site of Rainbow Lodge), which requires both hiking experience and a permit obtained from the Navajo Nation in Window Rock, Arizona.

==Size comparison==
Two other natural arches, Kolob Arch and Landscape Arch, both also in southern Utah, have confirmed spans several meters longer than Rainbow Bridge, but by most definitions of the terms they are considered to be arches rather than bridges. With a height of Rainbow Bridge stands taller than either of its longer competitors, but it is outdone by Aloba Arch in Chad at . The world&#x27;s tallest (though less easily accessible) arch is Töshük Tagh, better known as Shipton&#x27;s Arch, in China at an estimated . Xianren Bridge (also known as Fairy Bridge), in Guangxi Province, China, with a span of about , and a height of the opening of , appears to be the natural bridge with the largest span in the world.

<doc id="344767" wikidata="Q585603" url="?curid=344767" title="Rhino (JavaScript engine)">
<text>Rhino is a JavaScript engine written fully in Java and managed by the Mozilla Foundation as open source software. It is separate from the SpiderMonkey engine, which is also developed by Mozilla, but written in C++ and used in Mozilla Firefox.

== History ==
The Rhino project was started at Netscape in 1997. At the time, Netscape was planning to produce a version of Netscape Navigator written fully in Java and so it needed an implementation of JavaScript written in Java. When Netscape stopped work on &quot;Javagator&quot;, as it was called, the Rhino project was finished as a JavaScript engine. Since then, a couple of major companies (including Sun Microsystems) have licensed Rhino for use in their products and paid Netscape to do so, allowing work to continue on it.

Originally, Rhino compiled all JavaScript code to Java bytecode in generated Java class files. This produced the best performance, often beating the C++ implementation of JavaScript run with just-in-time compilation (JIT), but suffered from two faults. First, compiling time was long since generating bytecode and loading the generated classes was a resource-intensive process. Also, the implementation effectively leaked memory since most Java virtual machines (JVM) didn&#x27;t collect unused classes or the strings that are interned as a result of loading a class file. (This has changed in later versions of Java.)

As a result, in the fall of 1998, Rhino added an interpretive mode. The classfile generation code was moved to an optional, dynamically loaded package. Compiling is faster and when scripts are no longer in use they can be collected like any other Java object.

Rhino was released to Mozilla Foundation in April 1998. Originally Rhino classfile generation had been held back from release. However the licensors of Rhino have now agreed to release all of Rhino as open source, including class file generation. Since its release to open source, Rhino has found a variety of uses and an increasing number of people have contributed to the code. The project gets its name from the animal on the cover of the JavaScript book from O&#x27;Reilly Media. As of version 1.80 (January 2025), Rhino supports Java 11 and up, and supports a number of ECMAScript ES6/ES2015 features.

== Use ==
Rhino converts JavaScript scripts into classes. Rhino works in both compiled and interpreted mode. It is intended to be used in desktop or server-side applications, hence there is no built-in support for the Web browser objects that are commonly associated with JavaScript.

Rhino can be used as a debugger by using the Rhino shell. The JavaScript shell provides a simple way to run scripts in batch mode or within an interactive environment for exploratory programming. It can be used in applications by embedding Rhino.

A slightly modified version of Rhino 1.6r2 comes bundled with the Sun Microsystems release of Java SE version 6, which was released in December 2006. This makes it easier to integrate JavaScript as part of Java programs and to access Java resources from JavaScript. Other implementations of Java 6 may differ.

<doc id="344768" wikidata="Q2918074" url="?curid=344768" title="Sangh Parivar">
<text>The Sangh Parivar (translation: &quot;Family of the RSS&quot; or the &quot;RSS family&quot;) refers, as an umbrella term, to the collection of Hindutva organisations spawned by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which remain affiliated to it. These include the political party Bharatiya Janata Party, religious organisation Vishva Hindu Parishad, students union Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), religious militant organisation Bajrang Dal that forms the youth wing of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), and the worker&#x27;s union Bharatiya Kisan Sangh.

The Sangh Parivar represents the Hindu nationalist movement of India. Members of the Sangh Parivar or the supporters of its ideology are often referred to as Sanghis.

==History==
In the 1960s, the volunteers of the RSS joined the different social and political movements in India, including the Bhoodan, a land reform movement led by prominent Gandhian Vinobha Bhave and the Sarvodaya led by another Gandhian Jayaprakash Narayan. RSS also supported the formation of a trade union, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and a student&#x27;s organisation Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and many other organisations like Seva Bharati, Lok Bharati and Deendayal Research Institute among others.

These organisations started and supported by the RSS volunteers came to be known collectively as the Sangh Parivar. Next few decades have seen a steady growth in the influence of the Sangh Parivar in the social and political space of India.

==Ideology==
===Economics===
While the BJP governments have been progressively seen to be industry friendly, the opinions and the views of the Sangh Parivar constituents like Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) find consonance with the known leftist stands on labour rights. The Sangh Parivar, as a whole, even the BJP in its earlier days, has advocated &#x27;Swadeshi&#x27; (Self Reliance). Sangh Parivar leaders have been very vocal in their criticism of globalization especially its impact on the poor and native people. They have been suspicious of the role of international agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Sangh constituents have advocated and promoted decentralized village centric economic growth with emphasis on ecological protection.

===Ecology===
The constituents of the Sangh Parivar have been known for their demands for steps to &quot;protect the environment, natural-ecology and agro-economy&quot; and for establishment of a &quot;self-reliant village-oriented economy&quot;. They have been vocal in their demand against the use of chemical fertilizers and have supported preservation and development of organic farming in India. Many of these views are seen to mirror the concerns of the Green party.

The Bharatiya Janata Party, a constituent of Sangh Parivar included the concerns on global warming in its election manifesto for the National Elections of 2009. The manifesto promised prioritising &quot;combating climate change and global warming&quot;, &quot;programmes to arrest the melting of Himalayan glaciers&quot;, &quot;afforestation&quot; and emphasis on &quot;protecting India&#x27;s biodiversity&quot;.

===Reception===
The Sangh Parivar has been described with monikers spanning the spectrum from &quot;patriotic Hindus&quot; and &quot;Hindu nationalist&quot;. Some have also labeled them &quot;Hindu chauvinist&quot;. While its constituent organisations present themselves as embedded in the traditional ethos of Hinduism, their ideological opponents have characterized them as the representatives of authoritarian, xenophobic and majoritarian religious nationalism in India, These organisations have been accused being involved with &quot;Saffron terror&quot;. Flemish Indologist and Hindutva supporter Koenraad Elst has challenged the critics, in his 2001 book &quot;The Saffron Swastika&quot;, he wrote &quot;So far, the polemical arrows have all been shot from one side, replies from the other side being extremely rare or never more than piecemeal.&quot;

==Social impact==
The activities of the Sangh Parivar have had considerable social and religious impact. And considerable influence over country&#x27;s educational, social and defense policies.

===Social reform===
In 1979, the religious wing of the Sangh Parivar, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad got the Hindu saints and religious leaders to reaffirm that untouchability and caste discrimination had no religious sanction in the Hindu scriptures and texts. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad is also spearheading efforts to ordain Dalits as priests in temples across India, positions that were earlier usually occupied only by people of &quot;upper castes&quot;. In 1983, RSS founded a Dalit organisation called Samajik Samrasta Manch.

The leaders of the Sangh Parivar have also been involved in the campaigns against female foeticide and movements for the education. VHP founded a number of educational institutes such as &quot;Bharat Sevashram&quot;, &quot;Hindu Milan Mandir&quot;, &quot;Ekal Vidalayas&quot; and schools in tribal locations.

===Social and political empowerment===
The service programs, over the years, have led to the empowerment of the economically and socially underprivileged sections of the society, mostly the tribal, who have long remained politically under-represented. Babulal Marandi belonging to the tribal community, who was the organizing secretary of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, became the first Chief Minister of the state of Jharkhand. Other such leaders of Sangh Parivar who belong to the tribal community include Karia Munda, Jual Oram; both ministers in the Union Government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

The emergence of the Sangh Parivar in Indian politics also brought many Dalits and representatives of the backward classes, who had been victims of social neglect, to prominent positions in the Government and Administration. Suraj Bhan, a dalit, who had been a member of the RSS, became the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India, in 1998. Other leaders of the Sangh Parivar from the backward classes, who rose to prominence include Kalyan Singh, the former Chief Minister of UP, Uma Bharti, the former Chief Minister of MP, Narendra Modi, the incumbent Prime Minister of India, Gopinath Munde, the former Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, and Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh.

In many villages across India, &quot;Dharma Raksha Samitis&quot; (Duty/Religion Protection Committees) promote religious discourse and form an arena for bhajan performance. The Sangh sponsors calendars of Hindu deities and provides instruction on sanctioned methods of conducting Ganesh Chaturthi and Navaratri.

===Politics===
The Bharatiya Janata Party, which represents the Sangh Parivar in national politics, has formed three governments in India, most recently being in power from May 2014 under the leadership of Prime minister Narendra Modi, re-elected in May 2019 and again re-elected in 2024.

Political opponents of the BJP allege that the party&#x27;s moderate face merely serves to cover the Sangh Parivar&#x27;s &quot;hidden agenda&quot; of undiluted &quot;Hindutva&quot;, detectable by the BJP&#x27;s efforts to change the content of history textbooks and syllabi as well as other aspects of the education system.

Such criticism of the BJP arises from the fact that BJP had only 2 seats in the parliament in 1984 and after the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 the party gained national recognition, and rose to power in 1998.

===Babri Mosque demolition===
According to the report of the UPA instituted Liberhan Commission the Sangh Parivar organised the destruction of the Babri Masjid. The Commission said— &quot;The blame or the credit for the entire temple construction movement at Ayodhya must necessarily be attributed to the Sangh Parivar&quot;.

It also noted that the Sangh Parivar is an &quot;extensive and widespread organic body&quot;, which encompasses organisations, which address and bring together just about every type of social, professional and other demographic grouping of individuals.

<text>The Thyni (; ) were a Thracian tribe that lived in south-eastern Thrace. The Thyni were closely related to the Bithynians, with whom they often exchanged troops and royal marriages, later a section of the Thyni, along with the Bithyni, migrated to the area in Asia Minor that would later be known as and Bithynia, and where they would later be conquered by the Lydian and Persian empires. Each respective region (Thynia and Bithynia) got its name, presumably, from the Thracian tribe that was more prominent in the area. Xenophon (Anabasis VII, 2) praises the Thyni: &quot;Teres, with a large army, was said to have had his baggage train taken from him by the natives, who are called Thyni and are supposed to be the most dangerous of all the tribes, especially at night fighting.&quot; The Thyni included clubs amongst their weapons. The Thyni often joined the ranks of organized armies as mercenaries or volunteers.

<text>The Bithyni (; ; ) were a Thracian tribe who lived in Bithynia.

==History==

The Bithyni originally lived in the area of the lower Strymon river, due to which the ancient Greeks claimed that they were originally called the Strymoni (; ).

Around , the Paeonians displaced the Bithynians in the Strymon valley, after which they Bithyni migrated eastwards, and crossed the Thracian Bosporus and settled in northwestern Anatolia, where they assimilated the Phrygians and the Bebryces, with the region becoming known as Bithynia after them. The Dolonci tribe, who lived in the Thracian Chersonese and whom Greek mythology claimed were related to the Bithyni, might have been remnants of the Bithyni who were left behind on the European side of the Thracian Bosporus.

By the mid-6th century BC, the Bithyni had come under the rule of the Lydian empire, after which it became part of the Persian Achaemenid Empire when Cyrus II annexed Lydia.

==Culture==
The Bithyni used the round  shield in warfare.

<text>Üsküdar () is a municipality and district of Istanbul Province, Turkey. Its area is 35 km2, and its population is 524,452 (2022). It is a large and densely populated district on the Anatolian (Asian) shore of the Bosphorus. It is bordered to the north by Beykoz, to the east by Ümraniye, to the southeast by Ataşehir and to the south by Kadıköy; with Karaköy, Kabataş, Beşiktaş, and the historic Sarayburnu quarter of Fatih facing it on the opposite shore to the west. Üsküdar has been a conservative cultural center of the Anatolian side of Istanbul since Ottoman times with its landmark as well as numerous tiny mosques and dergahs. 

Üsküdar is a major transport hub, with ferries to Eminönü, Karaköy, Kabataş, Beşiktaş and some of the Bosphorus suburbs. Üsküdar is a stop on the Marmaray rail service at the point where it starts its journey under the Bosphorus, re-emerging on the European side at Sirkeci. Via Marmaray, Üsküdar is linked to Gebze on the Asian side of the city and Halkali on the European side. Üsküdar is also a stop on the M5 Metro line to Çekmeköy. Buses run along the Bosphorus shore all the way up north to Anadolu Kavağı in Beykoz district. A bus service also operates to the summer town of Şile on the Black Sea. 

Üsküdar started as Chrysopolis (Greek: , &#x27;Golden City&#x27;) and later became known as Scutari (, in Greek), a name it retained until the founding of the Turkish Republic.
Scutari was also used for the Albanian city Shkodër, which has a different etymology.

== Etymology ==
 was originally called (Byzantine Greek: ) during the Byzantine Empire. This may commemorate the leather shields used by guards since the word &quot;scutari&quot; means &#x27;raw tanned leather&#x27;. Invading Persians, Slavic tribes, Arabs, and Crusaders called the city or .
== History ==

=== Chrysopolis ===
Üsküdar was founded in the 7th century BC by ancient Greek colonists from Megara a few decades before Byzantium was founded on the opposite shore. It was originally called &quot;Chrysopolis&quot; (, &#x27;Golden City&#x27;). According to an ancient Greek geographer, the city received the name Chrysopolis because the Persian empire had a gold depository there or because it was associated with Agamemnon and Chryseis&#x27; son, Chryses. On the other hand, according to an 18th-century writer, it received the name because of the excellence of its harbor. The city was used as a harbor and shipyard and was an important staging post in the wars between the Greeks and Persians. In 410 BC Chrysopolis was taken by the Athenian general Alcibiades, and the Athenians used it thenceforth to charge a toll on ships coming from and going to the Black Sea. Long overshadowed by its neighbor Chalcedon during the Hellenistic and Roman period, it maintained its identity and increased its prosperity until it surpassed Chalcedon. Due to its less favorable location with respect to the currents of the Bosporus, however, it never surpassed Byzantium.
In AD 324, the final battle between Constantine I, Emperor of the West, and Licinius, Emperor of the East, in which Constantine defeated Licinius, took place at Chrysopolis. When Constantine made Byzantium his capital, Chrysopolis, together with Chalcedon, became suburbs. Chrysopolis remained important throughout the Byzantine period because all trade routes to Asia started there, and all Byzantine army units headed to Asia mustered there.
During the brief usurpation of the Armenian general Artabasdos, his eldest son, Niketas, was defeated with his forces at Chrysopolis by the army of Constantine V, before Artabasdos was finally deposed by the legitimate emperor Constantine and blinded. For this reason, and because of its location across from Constantinople, it was a natural target for anyone aiming at the capital. Also, in the 8th century AD it was taken by a small band of Arabs, who caused considerable destruction and panic in Constantinople, before withdrawing. In 988, a rebellion that nearly toppled Basil II began in Chrysopolis, before he was able to crush with the aid of Russian mercenaries.

=== Skoutarion, Scutari ===

In the 12th century, the city changed its name to &quot;Skoutarion&quot; (), the name deriving from the Emperor&#x27;s Skoutarion Palace nearby. In 1338 the Ottoman leader Orhan Gazi took Skoutarion, giving the Ottomans a base within sight of Constantinople for the first time.
In the Ottoman period Üsküdar was one of the three communities outside the city walls of Constantinople (along with Eyüp and Galata). The area was a major burial ground, and today many large cemeteries remain, including Karacaahmet Mezarlığı, Bülbülderesi Mezarlığı, and a number of Jewish and Christian cemeteries. Karacaahmet Mezarlığı is one of Istanbul&#x27;s largest cemeteries. The Bülbülderesi cemetery is next to Fevziye Hatun mosque.
The neighborhood suffered during the ethnic-religious violence of the 6 September 1955, Istanbul pogrom. Turkish rioters looted Greek and Armenian Christian shops and many Greeks and Armenians subsequently fled the country.

=== Üsküdar today ===

The district of Üsküdar is one of Istanbul&#x27;s oldest-established residential areas. It is directly opposite the old city of Eminönü and transport across the Bosphorus is easy by boat or bridge. So there are well-established communities here, many retired people, and many residents commute to the European side for work or school (being cheap and central Üsküdar has a large student population). During the rush-hour, the waterfront is bustling with people running from ferryboats and motorboats onto buses and minibuses. The Çamlıca Hill is a popular picnic spot for many Istanbul residents.

The central square is the center of Üsküdar with departing ferries and a Marmaray station adding to the importance of the square.
The area behind the ferry dock is a busy shopping district, with many restaurants (including the well-known &quot;Kanaat Lokantası&quot; serving Ottoman cuisine, olive oil-based dishes, and ice cream) and a number of important Ottoman mosques (see section below). The youth mainly congregate around cafes on Uncular Gastronomy Street that saw a rise in popularity following the Covid-19 pandemic. The private Üsküdar University, founded by the Human Values and Mental Health Foundation, has a campus here.
Uskudar has two public libraries: Şemsi Pasha Mosque Public Library (built in 1953) and Selimiye Public Library.

== Neighborhoods ==
Üsküdar is a municipality within borders of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (). The municipality is subdivided into 33 neighborhoods ():

The boundaries and names of the official neighborhoods change from time to time and sometimes do not correspond to historically recognized neighborhoods or to residents&#x27; own perceptions.
The most prominent neighborhood is Üsküdar&#x27;s historic center (), centered on the ferry docks and roughly corresponding to the current Mimar Sinan neighborhood (former Selmanağa, Tembel Hacı Mehmet, and İnkılap neighborhoods). This area includes large historic mosques, many businesses and markets, and is a transportation hub.
Other prominent neighborhoods include the former villages on the Bosphorus to the north of the historic center, Kuzguncuk, Beylerbeyi, Çengelköy, Kuleli, Vaniköy (now part of Kandilli), and Kandilli; the neighborhoods along the Bosphorus shore south of the historic center, Salacak, Harem (now part of Aziz Mahmud Hudayı), and Selimiye; and the mostly residential neighborhoods on the hilltops and hillsides, Doğancılar (now mostly part of Aziz Mahmud Hudayı), İmrahor (now part of Salacak), Selamsız (now part of Selamiali), Bağlarbaşı (now part of Altunizade), Altunizade, Acıbadem, Küçük Çamlıca, and Büyük Çamlıca (mostly in Kısıklı, Burhaniye, and Ferah).

=== Salacak ===
Üsküdar&#x27;s long promenade along the coast from the center down in southern direction towards the bus station at Harem is popular in summer as it commands views of the European shore of Topkapı Palace, Hagia Sophia, Sultan Ahmed Mosque (The Blue Mosque), Taksim and Beşiktaş. This promenade is lined with cafes and restaurants, the most prominent of which is not on the coast but out in the water: the Maiden&#x27;s Tower (), a small tower just off the coast that has existed since Byzantine times, when it was called Leander&#x27;s Tower. From time to time it has been used as a toll booth; now it is used as an upscale restaurant and a venue for wedding parties. The name comes from a legend about a princess shut in the tower.
On nice days people gather on the shore to fish, sit and drink tea or to enjoy being out on the water in little rowing boats. The Ayazma Mosque (1760) stands on the shore opposite the tower. The streets of Salacak behind the coast, in the area called &quot;Imrahor&quot;, are attractive and still hold a number of classic Ottoman wooden houses. The legendary 17th-century Hezarfen Ahmet Çelebi is said to have landed here on his hang-glider flight across the Bosphorus.
Further down along the coast is the Harem neighborhood, which contains a major intercity bus terminal and the Selimiye Barracks, where Florence Nightingale once tended wounded British soldiers. Behind the coast, towards the east, Üsküdar climbs steeply into the residential areas uphill, Bağlarbaşı and Doğancılar.

=== Doğancılar ===
A neighborhood on the hill above Salacak, with plenty of trees between the buildings and a small park. There is a wide avenue winding uphill from Üsküdar, which has plenty of shops and cafes, and also a theater (the Musahipzade Celal Sahnesi), the fire station, the former women&#x27;s prison (Paşakapısı Prison), Burhan Felek High School and Doğancılar mosque (opposite the park).

=== Bağlarbaşı and Altunizade ===
Formerly orchards and fruit-gardens (), it became a residential neighborhood in the 19th century, home to the typical Istanbul urban mix of Greeks, Jews, Turks, and Armenians. The neighborhood still has an Armenian school and the Armenian church of Surp Garabed, built in 1844. Until the 1990s the area remained a middle-class residential neighborhood, and today is still an attractive district with a mixture of housing and office/commercial property. A number of properties have been converted to office and business use. Altunizade is still an attractive residential neighborhood, home to the large and busy Capitol shopping and entertainment center. Altunizade was established in the early 19th century by Altunizade İsmail Zühtü Pasha. He also commissioned Altunizade Mosque, which was built in 1866.
There are a number of well-known schools within the district including Üsküdar American Academy, one of the oldest established schools in the city, Üsküdar High School, a state school, Haydarpasha High School, Marmara University&#x27;s faculty of theology; and Burhan Felek sports complex.

=== Selamsız ===

Selamsız is an old residential neighborhood, home to a Roma community and Roma culture.

=== Acıbadem ===
The top half of the attractive district Acıbadem also belongs to Üsküdar, including Acıbadem and Academic hospitals. This avenue with its patisseries, ice-cream parlors and cafés, is the center one of the most pleasant neighborhoods of Istanbul, consisting of tree-lined streets and well-planned housing areas, as well as Fine Arts Academy (Marmara University), and Çamlıca Girls’ High School set in a tree-lined garden.

=== Paşalimanı ===
Just past Üsküdar the coastline is called Paşalimanı. &quot;Liman&quot; means &quot;port&quot; in Turkish (from Greek , ) and boats would moor here. A large stone building on the shore, built as a tobacco warehouse by late-Ottoman architect Vedat Tek, has been completely renovated and now serves as headquarters of Ciner Grubu (Ciner Group), an industrial conglomerate. There is a small area of parkland right on the shore and the entrance to the large Fetih Paşa Korusu park is here.

=== Kuzguncuk ===

A Bosphorus village of streets with little shops, seaside cafes, and many old-fashioned wooden houses, Kuzguncuk has a village atmosphere. There is a ferry dock and a little park on the waterfront. The village was called &quot;Kosinitsa&quot; in the Byzantine period. The area has become an attractive middle-class neighborhood, home to people like film director Uğur Yücel, sculptor Kuzgun Acar, painter Acar Başkut (whose studio is in the village), architects Nevzat Sayin and Cengiz Bektaş, and the late poet Can Yücel. The neighborhood is also portrayed in the novel &quot;Mediterranean Waltz&quot; (Kumral Ada Mavi Tuna) by Buket Uzuner.

=== Beylerbeyi ===
Just beyond the Bosphorus Bridge is Beylerbeyi, an area known in Istanbul for its fish restaurants, and for the Beylerbeyi Palace on the shore. Sultan Abdülhamit II of Ottoman Empire died here in 1918.

=== Çengelköy ===
Formerly a waterfront village, known for the cucumbers grown in gardens on the green hillsides behind. There are a number of very grand seaside villas (). The village has a number of shops, bakeries and waterfront cafes offering gorgeous views of the Bosphorus that tend to be busy, especially at weekends. Since the mid-1990s new housing estates have been built on the hillsides and now there are always queues of traffic through Çengelköy. But the village retains some of its romantic charm. The word means &quot;hook&quot; or &quot;anchor&quot; in Turkish, and means &quot;village&quot;; apparently there were blacksmiths or metalworkers in the village in Ottoman times.
The highly prestigious Kuleli Military High School is on the Bosphorus just beyond Çengelköy. Most graduates from here go on to military academy and careers as army officers.

=== Çamlıca ===

This hill, known as &quot;Tchamlidja&quot; in 19th-century spelling, has the highest point in Istanbul and commands a panoramic view of the entire city. One of the most prestiged schools of Turkey, Bilfen College is located on the Çamlıca hill.

Üsküdar experiences a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa/Cf&quot;) according to both Köppen and Trewartha climate classifications, with cool winters and warm to hot summers. Unlike most of southern Istanbul, Üsküdar is cooler than its surroundings, with an average temperature slightly below , and an AHS heat zone rating of 3. However, its coastal location still does allow it to be classified as USDA hardiness zone 9a.

== Sights of Üsküdar ==

Though densely populated, Üsküdar has many areas of greenery, including the Çamlıca hills, the Bosphorus coastline, and various parks. In addition, the area has a high concentration of historic buildings and religious sites.

=== Parks ===
Fethi Paşa Korusu is a large park on the hillside that extends down to the Bosphorus shore, slightly beyond Üsküdar in the area called Paşalimanı. It is named after Fetih Ahmet Paşa an Ottoman prince who among other things was responsible for industrializing the glassworks of Ottoman Turkey, and had a home in the area. The parkland is in fact privately owned and let to the state on condition that it is preserved as a park. The owners are the estate of Turkish industrialist Nuri Demirağ. There is a café in the park, a stone waterfall which children climb on and a small stage area where on Friday evenings in summer a band of amateur musicians give open-air concerts at sunset. At weekends the young lovers of Üsküdar gather here to stroll and cuddle in the shade.

=== Mosques ===

Üsküdar is home to over 180 mosques, many of them historic Ottoman buildings, many built for women of the imperial harem, and many built by the architect Mimar Sinan. Among the first things one sees on arriving by ferry are two mosques near the ferry terminal, both of them designed by Sinan. The larger one is the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque, sometimes called the İskele (Dock) Mosque, built by a daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent; the smaller one is the Şemsi Pasha Mosque, built by a vizier of Suleiman&#x27;s. Şemsi Pasha has a small library building in the courtyard. Opposite the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque is the large Yeni Valide Mosque, commissioned by Ahmet III&#x27;s mother. Uphill from the dock in the Valideiatik neighborhood is the Atik Valide Mosque, built by Murat III&#x27;s mother and also designed by Sinan. 

Further uphill from there is the smaller Çinili (Tiled) Mosque. In Karacaahmet Cemetery is the large Şakirin Mosque, built in 2009. The Namazgâh Mosque (built in 1860) in the eastern part of Üsküdar, close to the border with Ümraniye, is one of the few historical wooden mosques in Istanbul. The new Çamlıca Mosque is a landmark with its grand size overlooking Istanbul on Chamlija Hill.

The Üsküdar Mevlevi dergah is the second of its kind following the one in Galata. Built in 1790 by Sheikh Numan Dede of the Galata lodge, it underwent many restorations and functions as the Classic Turkish Arts Foundation today.

<doc id="344775" wikidata="Q1377111" url="?curid=344775" title="Earthenware">
<text>Earthenware is glazed or unglazed nonvitreous pottery that has normally been fired below . Basic earthenware, often called terracotta, absorbs liquids such as water. However, earthenware can be made impervious to liquids by coating it with a ceramic glaze, and such a process is used for the great majority of modern domestic earthenware. The main other important types of pottery are porcelain, bone china, and stoneware, all fired at high enough temperatures to vitrify. End applications include tableware and decorative ware such as figurines.

Earthenware comprises &quot;most building bricks, nearly all European pottery up to the seventeenth century, most of the wares of Egypt, Persia and the near East; Greek, Roman and Mediterranean, and some of the Chinese; and the fine earthenware which forms the greater part of our tableware today&quot; (&quot;today&quot; being 1962). Pit fired earthenware dates back to as early as 29,000–25,000 BC, and for millennia, only earthenware pottery was made, with stoneware gradually developing some 5,000 years ago, but then apparently disappearing for a few thousand years. Outside East Asia, porcelain was manufactured at any scale only from the 18th century AD, and then initially as an expensive luxury.
After it is fired, earthenware is opaque and non-vitreous, soft and capable of being scratched with a knife. The Combined Nomenclature of the European Union describes it as being made of selected clays sometimes mixed with feldspars and varying amounts of other minerals, and white or light-coloured (i.e., slightly greyish, cream, or ivory).

==Characteristics==
Generally, unfired earthenware bodies exhibit higher plasticity than most whiteware bodies and hence are easier to shape by RAM press, roller-head or potter&#x27;s wheel than bone china or porcelain.
Due to its porosity, fired earthenware, with a water absorption of 5-8%, must be glazed to be watertight. Earthenware has lower mechanical strength than bone china, porcelain or stoneware, and consequently articles are commonly made in thicker cross-section, although they are still more easily chipped.

Darker-coloured terracotta earthenware, typically orange or red due to a comparatively high content of iron oxides, are widely used for flower pots, tiles and some decorative and oven ware.

==Production==
Materials

The compositions of earthenware bodies vary considerably, and include both prepared and &#x27;as dug&#x27;; the former being by far the dominant type for studio and industry. A general body formulation for contemporary earthenware is 25% kaolin, 25% ball clay, 35% quartz and 15% feldspar.

Shaping
Firing

Earthenware can be produced at firing temperatures as low as and many clays will not fire successfully above about . Much historical pottery was fired somewhere around , giving a wide margin of error where there was no precise way of measuring temperature, and very variable conditions within the kiln.
Modern earthenware may be biscuit (or &quot;bisque&quot;) fired to temperatures between and glost-fired (or &quot;glaze-fired&quot;) to between . Some studio potters follow the reverse practice, with a low-temperature biscuit firing and a high-temperature glost firing. Oxidising atmospheres are the most common.

After firing, most earthenware bodies will be colored white, buff or red. For iron-rich bodies earthenware, firing at comparatively low temperature in an oxidising atmosphere results in a red colour, whilst higher temperatures with a reducing atmosphere results in darker colours, including black. Higher firing temperatures may cause earthenware to bloat.

==Examples of earthenware==
Despite the most highly valued types of pottery often switching to stoneware and porcelain as these were developed by a particular culture, there are many artistically important types of earthenware. All ancient Greek and ancient Roman pottery is earthenware, as is the Hispano-Moresque ware of the late Middle Ages, which developed into tin-glazed pottery or faience traditions in several parts of Europe, mostly notably the painted maiolica of the Italian Renaissance, and Dutch Delftware. With a white glaze, these were able to imitate porcelains both from East Asia and Europe.

Amongst the most complicated earthenware ever made are the life-size Yixian glazed pottery luohans of the Liao dynasty (907–1125), Saint-Porchaire ware of the mid-16th century, apparently made for the French court and the life-size majolica peacocks by Mintons in the 1860s.

In the 18th century, especially in English Staffordshire pottery, technical improvements enabled very fine wares such as Wedgwood&#x27;s creamware, that competed with porcelain with considerable success, as his huge creamware Frog Service for Catherine the Great showed. The invention of transfer printing processes made highly decorated wares cheap enough for far wider sections of the population in Europe.

In China, sancai glazed wares were lead-glazed earthenware, and as elsewhere, terracotta remained important for sculpture. The Etruscans had made large sculptures such as statues in it, where the Romans used it mainly for figurines and Campana reliefs. Chinese painted or Tang dynasty tomb figures were earthenware as were the later Yixian glazed pottery luohans. After the ceramic figurine was revived in European porcelain, earthenware figures followed, such as the popular English Staffordshire figures.

<doc id="344783" wikidata="Q44481" url="?curid=344783" title="Pierre-Simon Laplace">
<text>Pierre-Simon, Marquis de Laplace (; ; 23 March 1749 – 5 March 1827) was a French scholar whose work was important to the development of engineering, mathematics, statistics, physics, astronomy, and philosophy. He summarized and extended the work of his predecessors in his five-volume &quot;Mécanique céleste&quot; (&quot;Celestial Mechanics&quot;) (1799–1825). This work translated the geometric study of classical mechanics to one based on calculus, opening up a broader range of problems. Laplace also popularized and further confirmed Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s work. In statistics, the Bayesian interpretation of probability was developed mainly by Laplace.

Laplace formulated Laplace&#x27;s equation, and pioneered the Laplace transform which appears in many branches of mathematical physics, a field that he took a leading role in forming. The Laplacian differential operator, widely used in mathematics, is also named after him. He restated and developed the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the Solar System and was one of the first scientists to suggest an idea similar to that of a black hole, with Stephen Hawking stating that &quot;Laplace essentially predicted the existence of black holes&quot;. He originated Laplace&#x27;s demon, which is a hypothetical all-predicting intellect. He also refined Newton&#x27;s calculation of the speed of sound to derive a more accurate measurement.

Laplace is regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;French Newton&quot; or &quot;Newton of France&quot;, he has been described as possessing a phenomenal natural mathematical faculty superior to that of almost all of his contemporaries. He was Napoleon&#x27;s examiner when Napoleon graduated from the &quot;École Militaire&quot; in Paris in 1785. Laplace became a count of the Empire in 1806 and was named a marquis in 1817, after the Bourbon Restoration.

==Early years==

Some details of Laplace&#x27;s life are not known, as records of it were burned in 1925 with the family château in Saint Julien de Mailloc, near Lisieux, the home of his great-great-grandson the Comte de Colbert-Laplace. Others had been destroyed earlier, when his house at Arcueil near Paris was looted in 1871.

Laplace was born in Beaumont-en-Auge, Normandy on 23 March 1749, a village four miles west of Pont l&#x27;Évêque. According to W. W. Rouse Ball, his father, Pierre de Laplace, owned and farmed the small estates of Maarquis. His great-uncle, Maitre Oliver de Laplace, had held the title of Chirurgien Royal. It would seem that from a pupil he became an usher in the school at Beaumont; but, having procured a letter of introduction to d&#x27;Alembert, he went to Paris to advance his fortune. However, Karl Pearson is scathing about the inaccuracies in Rouse Ball&#x27;s account and states:
His parents, Pierre Laplace and Marie-Anne Sochon, were from comfortable families. The Laplace family was involved in agriculture until at least 1750, but Pierre Laplace senior was also a cider merchant and &quot;syndic&quot; of the town of Beaumont.

Pierre Simon Laplace attended a school in the village run at a Benedictine priory, his father intending that he be ordained in the Roman Catholic Church. At sixteen, to further his father&#x27;s intention, he was sent to the University of Caen to read theology.

At the university, he was mentored by two enthusiastic teachers of mathematics, Christophe Gadbled and Pierre Le Canu, who awoke his zeal for the subject. Here Laplace&#x27;s brilliance as a mathematician was quickly recognised and while still at Caen he wrote a memoir &quot;Sur le Calcul integral aux differences infiniment petites et aux differences finies&quot;. This provided the first correspondence between Laplace and Lagrange. Lagrange was the senior by thirteen years, and had recently founded in his native city Turin a journal named &quot;Miscellanea Taurinensia&quot;, in which many of his early works were printed and it was in the fourth volume of this series that Laplace&#x27;s paper appeared. About this time, recognising that he had no vocation for the priesthood, he resolved to become a professional mathematician. Some sources state that he then broke with the church and became an atheist. Laplace did not graduate in theology but left for Paris with a letter of introduction from Le Canu to Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert who at that time was supreme in scientific circles.

According to his great-great-grandson, d&#x27;Alembert received him rather poorly, and to get rid of him gave him a thick mathematics book, saying to come back when he had read it. When Laplace came back a few days later, d&#x27;Alembert was even less friendly and did not hide his opinion that it was impossible that Laplace could have read and understood the book. But upon questioning him, he realised that it was true, and from that time he took Laplace under his care.

Another account is that Laplace solved overnight a problem that d&#x27;Alembert set him for submission the following week, then solved a harder problem the following night. D&#x27;Alembert was impressed and recommended him for a teaching place in the &quot;École Militaire&quot;.

With a secure income and undemanding teaching, Laplace now threw himself into original research and for the next seventeen years, 1771–1787, he produced much of his original work in astronomy.
From 1780 to 1784, Laplace and French chemist Antoine Lavoisier collaborated on several experimental investigations, designing their own equipment for the task. 
In 1783 they published their joint paper, &quot;Memoir on Heat&quot;, in which they discussed the kinetic theory of molecular motion.
In their experiments they measured the specific heat of various bodies, and the expansion of metals with increasing temperature. They also measured the boiling points of ethanol and ether under pressure.

Laplace further impressed the Marquis de Condorcet, and already by 1771 Laplace felt entitled to membership in the French Academy of Sciences. However, that year admission went to Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde and in 1772 to Jacques Antoine Joseph Cousin. Laplace was disgruntled, and early in 1773 d&#x27;Alembert wrote to Lagrange in Berlin to ask if a position could be found for Laplace there. However, Condorcet became permanent secretary of the &quot;Académie&quot; in February and Laplace was elected associate member on 31 March, at age 24. In 1773 Laplace read his paper on the invariability of planetary motion in front of the Academy des Sciences. That March he was elected to the academy, a place where he conducted the majority of his science.

On 15 March 1788, at the age of thirty-nine, Laplace married Marie-Charlotte de Courty de Romanges, an eighteen-year-old girl from a &quot;good&quot; family in Besançon. The wedding was celebrated at Saint-Sulpice, Paris. The couple had a son, Charles-Émile (1789–1874), and a daughter, Sophie-Suzanne (1792–1813).

==Analysis, probability, and astronomical stability==
Laplace&#x27;s early published work in 1771 started with differential equations and finite differences but he was already starting to think about the mathematical and philosophical concepts of probability and statistics. However, before his election to the &quot;Académie&quot; in 1773, he had already drafted two papers that would establish his reputation. The first, &quot;Mémoire sur la probabilité des causes par les événements&quot; was ultimately published in 1774 while the second paper, published in 1776, further elaborated his statistical thinking and also began his systematic work on celestial mechanics and the stability of the Solar System. The two disciplines would always be interlinked in his mind. &quot;Laplace took probability as an instrument for repairing defects in knowledge.&quot; Laplace&#x27;s work on probability and statistics is discussed below with his mature work on the analytic theory of probabilities.

===Stability of the Solar System===
Sir Isaac Newton had published his &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; in 1687 in which he gave a derivation of Kepler&#x27;s laws, which describe the motion of the planets, from his laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. However, though Newton had privately developed the methods of calculus, all his published work used cumbersome geometric reasoning, unsuitable to account for the more subtle higher-order effects of interactions between the planets. Newton himself had doubted the possibility of a mathematical solution to the whole, even concluding that periodic divine intervention was necessary to guarantee the stability of the Solar System. Dispensing with the hypothesis of divine intervention would be a major activity of Laplace&#x27;s scientific life. It is now generally regarded that Laplace&#x27;s methods on their own, though vital to the development of the theory, are not sufficiently precise to demonstrate the stability of the Solar System; today the Solar System is understood to be generally chaotic at fine scales, although currently fairly stable on coarse scale.

One particular problem from observational astronomy was the apparent instability whereby Jupiter&#x27;s orbit appeared to be shrinking while that of Saturn was expanding. The problem had been tackled by Leonhard Euler in 1748, and Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1763, but without success. In 1776, Laplace published a memoir in which he first explored the possible influences of a purported luminiferous ether or of a law of gravitation that did not act instantaneously. He ultimately returned to an intellectual investment in Newtonian gravity. Euler and Lagrange had made a practical approximation by ignoring small terms in the equations of motion. Laplace noted that though the terms themselves were small, when integrated over time they could become important. Laplace carried his analysis into the higher-order terms, up to and including the cubic. Using this more exact analysis, Laplace concluded that any two planets and the Sun must be in mutual equilibrium and thereby launched his work on the stability of the Solar System. Gerald James Whitrow described the achievement as &quot;the most important advance in physical astronomy since Newton&quot;.

Laplace had a wide knowledge of all sciences and dominated all discussions in the &quot;Académie&quot;. Laplace seems to have regarded analysis merely as a means of attacking physical problems, though the ability with which he invented the necessary analysis is almost phenomenal. As long as his results were true he took but little trouble to explain the steps by which he arrived at them; he never studied elegance or symmetry in his processes, and it was sufficient for him if he could by any means solve the particular question he was discussing.

==Tidal dynamics==
===Dynamic theory of tides===
While Newton explained the tides by describing the tide-generating forces and Bernoulli gave a description of the static reaction of the waters on Earth to the tidal potential, the &quot;dynamic theory of tides&quot;, developed by Laplace in 1775, describes the ocean&#x27;s real reaction to tidal forces. Laplace&#x27;s theory of ocean tides took into account friction, resonance and natural periods of ocean basins. It predicted the large amphidromic systems in the world&#x27;s ocean basins and explains the oceanic tides that are actually observed.
The equilibrium theory, based on the gravitational gradient from the Sun and Moon but ignoring the Earth&#x27;s rotation, the effects of continents, and other important effects, could not explain the real ocean tides. 
Since measurements have confirmed the theory, many things have possible explanations now, like how the tides interact with deep sea ridges and chains of seamounts give rise to deep eddies that transport nutrients from the deep to the surface. The equilibrium tide theory calculates the height of the tide wave of less than half a meter, while the dynamic theory explains why tides are up to 15 meters. Satellite observations confirm the accuracy of the dynamic theory, and the tides worldwide are now measured to within a few centimeters. Measurements from the CHAMP satellite closely match the models based on the TOPEX data. Accurate models of tides worldwide are essential for research since the variations due to tides must be removed from measurements when calculating gravity and changes in sea levels.

===Laplace&#x27;s tidal equations===
In 1776, Laplace formulated a single set of linear partial differential equations, for tidal flow described as a barotropic two-dimensional sheet flow. Coriolis effects are introduced as well as lateral forcing by gravity. Laplace obtained these equations by simplifying the fluid dynamic equations. But they can also be derived from energy integrals via Lagrange&#x27;s equation.

For a fluid sheet of average thickness &quot;D&quot;, the vertical tidal elevation &quot;ζ&quot;, as well as the horizontal velocity components &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; (in the latitude &quot;φ&quot; and longitude &quot;λ&quot; directions, respectively) satisfy Laplace&#x27;s tidal equations:
:formula_1
where &quot;Ω&quot; is the angular frequency of the planet&#x27;s rotation, &quot;g&quot; is the planet&#x27;s gravitational acceleration at the mean ocean surface, &quot;a&quot; is the planetary radius, and &quot;U&quot; is the external gravitational tidal-forcing potential.

William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) rewrote Laplace&#x27;s momentum terms using the curl to find an equation for vorticity. Under certain conditions this can be further rewritten as a conservation of vorticity.

==On the figure of the Earth==
During the years 1784–1787 he published some papers of exceptional power. Prominent among these is one read in 1783, reprinted as Part II of &quot;Théorie du Mouvement et de la figure elliptique des planètes&quot; in 1784, and in the third volume of the &quot;Mécanique céleste&quot;. In this work, Laplace completely determined the attraction of a spheroid on a particle outside it. This is memorable for the introduction into analysis of spherical harmonics or Laplace&#x27;s coefficients, and also for the development of the use of what we would now call the gravitational potential in celestial mechanics.

===Spherical harmonics===

In 1783, in a paper sent to the &quot;Académie&quot;, Adrien-Marie Legendre had introduced what are now known as associated Legendre functions. If two points in a plane have polar coordinates (&quot;r&quot;, θ) and (&quot;r&quot; &#x27;, θ&#x27;), where &quot;r&quot; &#x27; ≥ &quot;r&quot;, then, by elementary manipulation, the reciprocal of the distance between the points, &quot;d&quot;, can be written as:

:formula_2

This expression can be expanded in powers of &quot;r&quot;/&quot;r&quot; &#x27; using Newton&#x27;s generalised binomial theorem to give:

:formula_3

The sequence of functions &quot;P&quot;0&quot;k&quot;(cos φ) is the set of so-called &quot;associated Legendre functions&quot; and their usefulness arises from the fact that every function of the points on a circle can be expanded as a series of them.

Laplace, with scant regard for credit to Legendre, made the non-trivial extension of the result to three dimensions to yield a more general set of functions, the spherical harmonics or Laplace coefficients. The latter term is not in common use now.
===Potential theory===
This paper is also remarkable for the development of the idea of the scalar potential. The gravitational force acting on a body is, in modern language, a vector, having magnitude and direction. A potential function is a scalar function that defines how the vectors will behave. A scalar function is computationally and conceptually easier to deal with than a vector function.

Alexis Clairaut had first suggested the idea in 1743 while working on a similar problem though he was using Newtonian-type geometric reasoning. Laplace described Clairaut&#x27;s work as being &quot;in the class of the most beautiful mathematical productions&quot;. However, Rouse Ball alleges that the idea &quot;was appropriated from Joseph Louis Lagrange, who had used it in his memoirs of 1773, 1777 and 1780&quot;. The term &quot;potential&quot; itself was due to Daniel Bernoulli, who introduced it in his 1738 memoire &quot;Hydrodynamica&quot;. However, according to Rouse Ball, the term &quot;potential function&quot; was not actually used (to refer to a function &quot;V&quot; of the coordinates of space in Laplace&#x27;s sense) until George Green&#x27;s 1828 &quot;An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism&quot;.

Laplace applied the language of calculus to the potential function and showed that it always satisfies the differential equation:

:formula_4

An analogous result for the velocity potential of a fluid had been obtained some years previously by Leonhard Euler.

Laplace&#x27;s subsequent work on gravitational attraction was based on this result. The quantity ∇2&quot;V&quot; has been termed the concentration of &quot;V&quot; and its value at any point indicates the &quot;excess&quot; of the value of &quot;V&quot; there over its mean value in the neighbourhood of the point. Laplace&#x27;s equation, a special case of Poisson&#x27;s equation, appears ubiquitously in mathematical physics. The concept of a potential occurs in fluid dynamics, electromagnetism and other areas. Rouse Ball speculated that it might be seen as &quot;the outward sign&quot; of one of the &quot;a priori&quot; forms in Kant&#x27;s theory of perception.

The spherical harmonics turn out to be critical to practical solutions of Laplace&#x27;s equation. Laplace&#x27;s equation in spherical coordinates, such as are used for mapping the sky, can be simplified, using the method of separation of variables into a radial part, depending solely on distance from the centre point, and an angular or spherical part. The solution to the spherical part of the equation can be expressed as a series of Laplace&#x27;s spherical harmonics, simplifying practical computation.

==Planetary and lunar inequalities==

===Jupiter–Saturn great inequality===

Laplace presented a memoir on planetary inequalities in three sections, in 1784, 1785, and 1786. This dealt mainly with the identification and explanation of the perturbations now known as the &quot;great Jupiter–Saturn inequality&quot;. Laplace solved a longstanding problem in the study and prediction of the movements of these planets. He showed by general considerations, first, that the mutual action of two planets could never cause large changes in the eccentricities and inclinations of their orbits; but then, even more importantly, that peculiarities arose in the Jupiter–Saturn system because of the near approach to commensurability of the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn.

In this context &quot;commensurability&quot; means that the ratio of the two planets&#x27; mean motions is very nearly equal to a ratio between a pair of small whole numbers. Two periods of Saturn&#x27;s orbit around the Sun almost equal five of Jupiter&#x27;s. The corresponding difference between multiples of the mean motions, , corresponds to a period of nearly 900 years, and it occurs as a small divisor in the integration of a very small perturbing force with this same period. As a result, the integrated perturbations with this period are disproportionately large, about 0.8° degrees of arc in orbital longitude for Saturn and about 0.3° for Jupiter.

Further developments of these theorems on planetary motion were given in his two memoirs of 1788 and 1789, but with the aid of Laplace&#x27;s discoveries, the tables of the motions of Jupiter and Saturn could at last be made much more accurate. It was on the basis of Laplace&#x27;s theory that Delambre computed his astronomical tables.

===Books===

Laplace now set himself the task to write a work which should &quot;offer a complete solution of the great mechanical problem presented by the Solar System, and bring theory to coincide so closely with observation that empirical equations should no longer find a place in astronomical tables.&quot; The result is embodied in the &quot;Exposition du système du monde&quot; and the &quot;Mécanique céleste&quot;.

The former was published in 1796, and gives a general explanation of the phenomena, but omits all details. It contains a summary of the history of astronomy. This summary procured for its author the honour of admission to the forty of the French Academy and is commonly esteemed one of the masterpieces of French literature, though it is not altogether reliable for the later periods of which it treats.

Laplace developed the nebular hypothesis of the formation of the Solar System, first suggested by Emanuel Swedenborg and expanded by Immanuel Kant. This hypothesis remains the most widely accepted model in the study of the origin of planetary systems. According to Laplace&#x27;s description of the hypothesis, the Solar System evolved from a globular mass of incandescent gas rotating around an axis through its centre of mass. As it cooled, this mass contracted, and successive rings broke off from its outer edge. These rings in their turn cooled, and finally condensed into the planets, while the Sun represented the central core which was still left. On this view, Laplace predicted that the more distant planets would be older than those nearer the Sun.

As mentioned, the idea of the nebular hypothesis had been outlined by Immanuel Kant in 1755, who had also suggested &quot;meteoric aggregations&quot; and tidal friction as causes affecting the formation of the Solar System. Laplace was probably aware of this, but, like many writers of his time, he generally did not reference the work of others.

Laplace&#x27;s analytical discussion of the Solar System is given in his &quot;Mécanique céleste&quot; published in five volumes. The first two volumes, published in 1799, contain methods for calculating the motions of the planets, determining their figures, and resolving tidal problems. The third and fourth volumes, published in 1802 and 1805, contain applications of these methods, and several astronomical tables. The fifth volume, published in 1825, is mainly historical, but it gives as appendices the results of Laplace&#x27;s latest researches. The &quot;Mécanique céleste&quot; contains numerous of Laplace&#x27;s own investigations but many results are appropriated from other writers with little or no acknowledgement. The volume&#x27;s conclusions, which are described by historians as the organised result of a century of work by other writers as well as Laplace, are presented by Laplace if they were his discoveries alone.

Jean-Baptiste Biot, who assisted Laplace in revising it for the press, says that Laplace himself was frequently unable to recover the details in the chain of reasoning, and, if satisfied that the conclusions were correct, he was content to insert the phrase, &quot;Il est aisé à voir que...&quot; (&quot;It is easy to see that...&quot;). The &quot;Mécanique céleste&quot; is not only the translation of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; into the language of differential calculus, but it completes parts of which Newton had been unable to fill in the details. The work was carried forward in a more finely tuned form in Félix Tisserand&#x27;s &quot;Traité de mécanique céleste&quot; (1889–1896), but Laplace&#x27;s treatise remains a standard authority.
In the years 1784–1787, Laplace produced some memoirs of exceptional power. The significant among these was one issued in 1784, and reprinted in the third volume of the &quot;Mécanique céleste&quot;. In this work he completely determined the attraction of a spheroid on a particle outside it. This is known for the introduction into analysis of the potential, a useful mathematical concept of broad applicability to the physical sciences.

==Optics==
Laplace was a supporter of the corpuscle theory of light of Newton. In the fourth edition of &quot;Mécanique Céleste&quot;, Laplace assumed that short-ranged molecular forces were responsible for refraction of the corpuscles of light. Laplace and Étienne-Louis Malus also showed that Huygens principle of double refraction could be recovered from the principle of least action on light particles.

However in 1815, Augustin-Jean Fresnel presented a new wave theory for diffraction to a commission of the French Academy with the help of François Arago. Laplace was one of the commission members and they ultimately awarded a prize to Fresnel for his new approach.

===Influence of gravity on light===
Using corpuscular theory, Laplace also came close to propounding the concept of the black hole. He suggested that gravity could influence light and that there could be massive stars whose gravity is so great that not even light could escape from their surface (see escape velocity). However, this insight was so far ahead of its time that it played no role in the history of scientific development.

==Arcueil==
In 1806, Laplace bought a house in Arcueil, then a village and not yet absorbed into the Paris conurbation. The chemist Claude Louis Berthollet was a neighbour – their gardens were not separated – and the pair formed the nucleus of an informal scientific circle, latterly known as the Society of Arcueil. Because of their closeness to Napoleon, Laplace and Berthollet effectively controlled advancement in the scientific establishment and admission to the more prestigious offices. The Society built up a complex pyramid of patronage. In 1806, Laplace was also elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

==Analytic theory of probabilities==
In 1812, Laplace issued his &quot;Théorie analytique des probabilités&quot; in which he laid down many fundamental results in statistics. The first half of this treatise was concerned with probability methods and problems, the second half with statistical methods and applications. Laplace&#x27;s proofs are not always rigorous according to the standards of a later day, and his perspective slides back and forth between the Bayesian and non-Bayesian views with an ease that makes some of his investigations difficult to follow, but his conclusions remain basically sound even in those few situations where his analysis goes astray. In 1819, he published a popular account of his work on probability. This book bears the same relation to the &quot;Théorie des probabilités&quot; that the &quot;Système du monde&quot; does to the &quot;Mécanique céleste&quot;. In its emphasis on the analytical importance of probabilistic problems, especially in the context of the &quot;approximation of formula functions of large numbers,&quot; Laplace&#x27;s work goes beyond the contemporary view which almost exclusively considered aspects of practical applicability. Laplace&#x27;s Théorie analytique remained the most influential book of mathematical probability theory to the end of the 19th century. The general relevance for statistics of Laplacian error theory was appreciated only by the end of the 19th century. However, it influenced the further development of a largely analytically oriented probability theory.

===Inductive probability===
In his &quot;Essai philosophique sur les probabilités&quot; (1814), Laplace set out a mathematical system of inductive reasoning based on probability, which we would today recognise as Bayesian. He begins the text with a series of principles of probability, the first seven being:

# Probability is the ratio of the &quot;favored events&quot; to the total possible events.
# The first principle assumes equal probabilities for all events. When this is not true, we must first determine the probabilities of each event. Then, the probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible favoured events.
# For independent events, the probability of the occurrence of all is the probability of each multiplied together.
# When two events &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; depend on each other, the probability of compound event is the probability of &quot;A&quot; multiplied by the probability that, given &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; will occur.
# The probability that &quot;A&quot; will occur, given that B has occurred, is the probability of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; occurring divided by the probability of &quot;B&quot;.
# Three corollaries are given for the sixth principle, which amount to Bayesian rule. Where event } exhausts the list of possible causes for event &quot;B&quot;, . Then formula_5
# The probability of a future event &quot;C&quot; is the sum of the products of the probability of each causes &quot;Bi&quot; drawn from the event observed &quot;A&quot;, by the probability that, this cause existing, the future event will occur. Symbolically, formula_6

One well-known formula arising from his system is the rule of succession, given as principle seven. Suppose that some trial has only two possible outcomes, labelled &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot;. Under the assumption that little or nothing is known &quot;a priori&quot; about the relative plausibilities of the outcomes, Laplace derived a formula for the probability that the next trial will be a success.

:formula_7

where &quot;s&quot; is the number of previously observed successes and &quot;n&quot; is the total number of observed trials. It is still used as an estimator for the probability of an event if we know the event space, but have only a small number of samples.

The rule of succession has been subject to much criticism, partly due to the example which Laplace chose to illustrate it. He calculated that the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow, given that it has never failed to in the past, was

:formula_8

where &quot;d&quot; is the number of times the sun has risen in the past. This result has been derided as absurd, and some authors have concluded that all applications of the Rule of Succession are absurd by extension. However, Laplace was fully aware of the absurdity of the result; immediately following the example, he wrote, &quot;But this number [i.e., the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow] is far greater for him who, seeing in the totality of phenomena the principle regulating the days and seasons, realizes that nothing at the present moment can arrest the course of it.&quot;

===Probability-generating function===
The method of estimating the ratio of the number of favourable cases to the whole number of possible cases had been previously indicated by Laplace in a paper written in 1779. It consists of treating the successive values of any function as the coefficients in the expansion of another function, with reference to a different variable. The latter is therefore called the probability-generating function of the former. Laplace then shows how, by means of interpolation, these coefficients may be determined from the generating function. Next he attacks the converse problem, and from the coefficients he finds the generating function; this is effected by the solution of a finite difference equation.

===Least squares and central limit theorem===
The fourth chapter of this treatise includes an exposition of the method of least squares, a remarkable testimony to Laplace&#x27;s command over the processes of analysis. In 1805 Legendre had published the method of least squares, making no attempt to tie it to the theory of probability. In 1809 Gauss had derived the normal distribution from the principle that the arithmetic mean of observations gives the most probable value for the quantity measured; then, turning this argument back upon itself, he showed that, if the errors of observation are normally distributed, the least squares estimates give the most probable values for the coefficients in regression situations. These two works seem to have spurred Laplace to complete work toward a treatise on probability he had contemplated as early as 1783.

In two important papers in 1810 and 1811, Laplace first developed the characteristic function as a tool for large-sample theory and proved the first general central limit theorem. Then in a supplement to his 1810 paper written after he had seen Gauss&#x27;s work, he showed that the central limit theorem provided a Bayesian justification for least squares: if one were combining observations, each one of which was itself the mean of a large number of independent observations, then the least squares estimates would not only maximise the likelihood function, considered as a posterior distribution, but also minimise the expected posterior error, all this without any assumption as to the error distribution or a circular appeal to the principle of the arithmetic mean. In 1811 Laplace took a different non-Bayesian tack. Considering a linear regression problem, he restricted his attention to linear unbiased estimators of the linear coefficients. After showing that members of this class were approximately normally distributed if the number of observations was large, he argued that least squares provided the &quot;best&quot; linear estimators. Here it is &quot;best&quot; in the sense that it minimised the asymptotic variance and thus both minimised the expected absolute value of the error, and maximised the probability that the estimate would lie in any symmetric interval about the unknown coefficient, no matter what the error distribution. His derivation included the joint limiting distribution of the least squares estimators of two parameters.

==Laplace&#x27;s demon==

In 1814, Laplace published what may have been the first scientific articulation of causal determinism:
This intellect is often referred to as &quot;Laplace&#x27;s demon&quot; (in the same vein as &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s demon&quot;) and sometimes &quot;Laplace&#x27;s Superman&quot; (after Hans Reichenbach). Laplace, himself, did not use the word &quot;demon&quot;, which was a later embellishment. As translated into English above, he simply referred to: &quot;Une intelligence ... Rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et l&#x27;avenir comme le passé, serait présent à ses yeux.&quot;

Even though Laplace is generally credited with having first formulated the concept of causal determinism, in a philosophical context the idea was actually widespread at the time, and can be found as early as 1756 in Maupertuis&#x27; &#x27;Sur la Divination&#x27;. As well, Jesuit scientist Boscovich first proposed a version of scientific determinism very similar to Laplace&#x27;s in his 1758 book &quot;Theoria philosophiae naturalis&quot;.

==Laplace transforms==

As early as 1744, Euler, followed by Lagrange, had started looking for solutions of differential equations in the form:

:formula_9
The Laplace transform has the form:
:formula_10
This integral operator transforms a function of time (formula_11) into a function of a complex variable (formula_12), usually interpreted as complex frequency.

==Other discoveries and accomplishments==
===Mathematics===
Among the other discoveries of Laplace in pure and applied mathematics are:
* Discussion, contemporaneously with Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde, of the general theory of determinants, (1772);
* Proof that every equation of an odd degree must have at least one real quadratic factor;
* Laplace&#x27;s method for approximating integrals
* Solution of the linear partial differential equation of the second order;
* He was the first to consider the difficult problems involved in equations of mixed differences, and to prove that the solution of an equation in finite differences of the first degree and the second order might always be obtained in the form of a continued fraction;
* In his theory of probabilities:
** de Moivre–Laplace theorem that approximates binomial distribution with a normal distribution
** Evaluation of several common definite integrals;
** General proof of the Lagrange reversion theorem.

===Surface tension===

Laplace built upon the qualitative work of Thomas Young to develop the theory of capillary action and the Young–Laplace equation.

===Speed of sound===
Laplace in 1816 was the first to point out that the speed of sound in air depends on the heat capacity ratio. Newton&#x27;s original theory gave too low a value, because it does not take account of the adiabatic compression of the air which results in a local rise in temperature and pressure. Laplace&#x27;s investigations in practical physics were confined to those carried on by him jointly with Lavoisier in the years 1782 to 1784 on the specific heat of various bodies.

==Politics==
===Minister of the Interior===
In his early years, Laplace was careful never to become involved in politics, or indeed in life outside the &quot;Académie des sciences&quot;. He prudently withdrew from Paris during the most violent part of the Revolution.

In November 1799, immediately after seizing power in the coup of 18 Brumaire, Napoleon appointed Laplace to the post of Minister of the Interior. The appointment, however, lasted only six weeks, after which Lucien Bonaparte, Napoleon&#x27;s brother, was given the post. Evidently, once Napoleon&#x27;s grip on power was secure, there was no need for a prestigious but inexperienced scientist in the government. Napoleon later (in his &quot;Mémoires de Sainte Hélène&quot;) wrote of Laplace&#x27;s dismissal as follows:

Grattan-Guinness, however, describes these remarks as &quot;tendentious&quot;, since there seems to be no doubt that Laplace &quot;was only appointed as a short-term figurehead, a place-holder while Napoleon consolidated power&quot;.

===From Bonaparte to the Bourbons===

Although Laplace was removed from office, it was desirable to retain his allegiance. He was accordingly raised to the senate, and to the third volume of the &quot;Mécanique céleste&quot; he prefixed a note that of all the truths therein contained the most precious to the author was the declaration he thus made of his devotion towards the peacemaker of Europe. In copies sold after the Bourbon Restoration this was struck out. (Pearson points out that the censor would not have allowed it anyway.) In 1814 it was evident that the empire was falling; Laplace hastened to tender his services to the Bourbons, and in 1817 during the Restoration he was rewarded with the title of marquis.

According to Rouse Ball, the contempt that his more honest colleagues felt for his conduct in the matter may be read in the pages of Paul Louis Courier. His knowledge was useful on the numerous scientific commissions on which he served, and, says Rouse Ball, probably accounts for the manner in which his political insincerity was overlooked.

Roger Hahn in his 2005 biography disputes this portrayal of Laplace as an opportunist and turncoat, pointing out that, like many in France, he had followed the debacle of Napoleon&#x27;s Russian campaign with serious misgivings. The Laplaces, whose only daughter Sophie had died in childbirth in September 1813, were in fear for the safety of their son Émile, who was on the eastern front with the emperor. Napoleon had originally come to power promising stability, but it was clear that he had overextended himself, putting the nation at peril. It was at this point that Laplace&#x27;s loyalty began to weaken. Although he still had easy access to Napoleon, his personal relations with the emperor cooled considerably. As a grieving father, he was particularly cut to the quick by Napoleon&#x27;s insensitivity in an exchange related by Jean-Antoine Chaptal: &quot;On his return from the rout in Leipzig, he [Napoleon] accosted Mr Laplace: &#x27;Oh! I see that you have grown thin—Sire, I have lost my daughter—Oh! that&#x27;s not a reason for losing weight. You are a mathematician; put this event in an equation, and you will find that it adds up to zero.&#x27;&quot;

===Political philosophy===
In the second edition (1814) of the &quot;Essai philosophique&quot;, Laplace added some revealing comments on politics and governance. Since it is, he says, &quot;the practice of the eternal principles of reason, justice and humanity that produce and preserve societies, there is a great advantage to adhere to these principles, and a great inadvisability to deviate from them&quot;. Noting &quot;the depths of misery into which peoples have been cast&quot; when ambitious leaders disregard these principles, Laplace makes a veiled criticism of Napoleon&#x27;s conduct: &quot;Every time a great power intoxicated by the love of conquest aspires to universal domination, the sense of liberty among the unjustly threatened nations breeds a coalition to which it always succumbs.&quot; Laplace argues that &quot;in the midst of the multiple causes that direct and restrain various states, natural limits&quot; operate, within which it is &quot;important for the stability as well as the prosperity of empires to remain&quot;. States that transgress these limits cannot avoid being &quot;reverted&quot; to them, &quot;just as is the case when the waters of the seas whose floor has been lifted by violent tempests sink back to their level by the action of gravity&quot;.

About the political upheavals he had witnessed, Laplace formulated a set of principles derived from physics to favour evolutionary over revolutionary change:
In these lines, Laplace expressed the views he had arrived at after experiencing the Revolution and the Empire. He believed that the stability of nature, as revealed through scientific findings, provided the model that best helped to preserve the human species. &quot;Such views,&quot; Hahn comments, &quot;were also of a piece with his steadfast character.&quot;

In the &quot;Essai philosophique&quot;, Laplace also illustrates the potential of probabilities in political studies by applying the law of large numbers to justify the candidates’ integer-valued ranks used in the Borda method of voting, with which the new members of the Academy of Sciences were elected. Laplace’s verbal argument is so rigorous that it can easily be converted into a formal proof.

==Death==

Laplace died in Paris on 5 March 1827, which was the same day Alessandro Volta died. His brain was removed by his physician, François Magendie, and kept for many years, eventually being displayed in a roving anatomical museum in Britain. It was reportedly smaller than the average brain. Laplace was buried at Père Lachaise in Paris but in 1888 his remains were moved to Saint Julien de Mailloc in the canton of Orbec and reinterred on the family estate. The tomb is situated on a hill overlooking the village of St Julien de Mailloc, Normandy, France.

==Religious opinions==
===&quot;I had no need of that hypothesis&quot;===

A frequently cited but potentially apocryphal interaction between Laplace and Napoleon purportedly concerns the existence of God. Although the conversation in question did occur, the exact words Laplace used and his intended meaning are not known. A typical version is provided by Rouse Ball:
An earlier report, although without the mention of Laplace&#x27;s name, is found in Antommarchi&#x27;s &quot;The Last Moments of Napoleon&quot; (1825):
In 1884, however, the astronomer Hervé Faye affirmed that this account of Laplace&#x27;s exchange with Napoleon presented a &quot;strangely transformed&quot; (&quot;étrangement transformée&quot;) or garbled version of what had actually happened. It was not God that Laplace had treated as a hypothesis, but merely his intervention at a determinate point:
Laplace&#x27;s younger colleague, the astronomer François Arago, who gave his eulogy before the French Academy in 1827, told Faye of an attempt by Laplace to keep the garbled version of his interaction with Napoleon out of circulation. Faye writes:
The Swiss-American historian of mathematics Florian Cajori appears to have been unaware of Faye&#x27;s research, but in 1893 he came to a similar conclusion. Stephen Hawking said in 1999, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that Laplace was claiming that God does not exist. It&#x27;s just that he doesn&#x27;t intervene, to break the laws of Science.&quot;

The only eyewitness account of Laplace&#x27;s interaction with Napoleon is from the entry for 8 August 1802 in the diary of the British astronomer Sir William Herschel:

Since this makes no mention of Laplace&#x27;s saying, &quot;I had no need of that hypothesis,&quot; Daniel Johnson argues that &quot;Laplace never used the words attributed to him.&quot; Arago&#x27;s testimony, however, appears to imply that he did, only not in reference to the existence of God.

===Views on God===
Raised a Catholic, Laplace appears in adult life to have inclined to deism (presumably his considered position, since it is the only one found in his writings). However, some of his contemporaries thought he was an atheist, while a number of recent scholars have described him as agnostic.

Faye thought that Laplace &quot;did not profess atheism&quot;, but Napoleon, on Saint Helena, told General Gaspard Gourgaud, &quot;I often asked Laplace what he thought of God. He owned that he was an atheist.&quot; Roger Hahn, in his biography of Laplace, mentions a dinner party at which &quot;the geologist Jean-Étienne Guettard was staggered by Laplace&#x27;s bold denunciation of the existence of God.&quot; It appeared to Guettard that Laplace&#x27;s atheism &quot;was supported by a thoroughgoing materialism.&quot; But the chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, who knew Laplace well in the 1820s, wrote that Laplace &quot;provided materialists with their specious arguments, without sharing their convictions.&quot;

Hahn states: &quot;Nowhere in his writings, either public or private, does Laplace deny God&#x27;s existence.&quot; Expressions occur in his private letters that appear inconsistent with atheism. On 17 June 1809, for instance, he wrote to his son, &quot;&quot;Je prie Dieu qu&#x27;il veille sur tes jours. Aie-Le toujours présent à ta pensée, ainsi que ton père et ta mère&quot; [I pray that God watches over your days. Let Him be always present to your mind, as also your father and your mother].&quot; Ian S. Glass, quoting Herschel&#x27;s account of the celebrated exchange with Napoleon, writes that Laplace was &quot;evidently a deist like Herschel&quot;.

In &quot;Exposition du système du monde&quot;, Laplace quotes Newton&#x27;s assertion that &quot;the wondrous disposition of the Sun, the planets and the comets, can only be the work of an all-powerful and intelligent Being.&quot; This, says Laplace, is a &quot;thought in which he [Newton] would be even more confirmed, if he had known what we have shown, namely that the conditions of the arrangement of the planets and their satellites are precisely those which ensure its stability.&quot; By showing that the &quot;remarkable&quot; arrangement of the planets could be entirely explained by the laws of motion, Laplace had eliminated the need for the &quot;supreme intelligence&quot; to intervene, as Newton had &quot;made&quot; it do. Laplace cites with approval Leibniz&#x27;s criticism of Newton&#x27;s invocation of divine intervention to restore order to the Solar System: &quot;This is to have very narrow ideas about the wisdom and the power of God.&quot; He evidently shared Leibniz&#x27;s astonishment at Newton&#x27;s belief &quot;that God has made his machine so badly that unless he affects it by some extraordinary means, the watch will very soon cease to go.&quot;

In a group of manuscripts, preserved in relative secrecy in a black envelope in the library of the &quot;Académie des sciences&quot; and published for the first time by Hahn, Laplace mounted a deist critique of Christianity. It is, he writes, the &quot;first and most infallible of principles ... to reject miraculous facts as untrue.&quot; As for the doctrine of transubstantiation, it &quot;offends at the same time reason, experience, the testimony of all our senses, the eternal laws of nature, and the sublime ideas that we ought to form of the Supreme Being.&quot; It is the sheerest absurdity to suppose that &quot;the sovereign lawgiver of the universe would suspend the laws that he has established, and which he seems to have maintained invariably.&quot;

Laplace also ridiculed the use of probability in theology. Even following Pascal&#x27;s reasoning presented in Pascal&#x27;s wager, it is not worth making a bet, for the hope of profit – equal to the product of the value of the testimonies (infinitely small) and the value of the happiness they promise (which is significant but finite) – must necessarily be infinitely small.

In old age, Laplace remained curious about the question of God and frequently discussed Christianity with the Swiss astronomer Jean-Frédéric-Théodore Maurice. He told Maurice that &quot;Christianity is quite a beautiful thing&quot; and praised its civilising influence. Maurice thought that the basis of Laplace&#x27;s beliefs was, little by little, being modified, but that he held fast to his conviction that the invariability of the laws of nature did not permit of supernatural events. After Laplace&#x27;s death, Poisson told Maurice, &quot;You know that I do not share your [religious] opinions, but my conscience forces me to recount something that will surely please you.&quot; When Poisson had complimented Laplace about his &quot;brilliant discoveries&quot;, the dying man had fixed him with a pensive look and replied, &quot;Ah! We chase after phantoms [&quot;chimères&quot;].&quot; These were his last words, interpreted by Maurice as a realisation of the ultimate &quot;vanity&quot; of earthly pursuits. Laplace received the last rites from the curé of the Missions Étrangères (in whose parish he was to be buried) and the curé of Arcueil.

According to his biographer, Roger Hahn, it is &quot;not credible&quot; that Laplace &quot;had a proper Catholic end&quot;, and he &quot;remained a skeptic&quot; to the very end of his life. Laplace in his last years has been described as an agnostic.

===Excommunication of a comet===
In 1470 the humanist scholar Bartolomeo Platina wrote that Pope Callixtus III had asked for prayers for deliverance from the Turks during a 1456 appearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet. Platina&#x27;s account does not accord with Church records, which do not mention the comet. Laplace is alleged to have embellished the story by claiming the Pope had &quot;excommunicated&quot; Halley&#x27;s comet. What Laplace actually said, in &quot;Exposition du système du monde&quot; (1796), was that the Pope had ordered the comet to be &quot;exorcised&quot; (&quot;conjuré&quot;). It was Arago, in &quot;Des Comètes en général&quot; (1832), who first spoke of an excommunication.

==Quotations==
* I had no need of that hypothesis. (&quot;Je n&#x27;avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse-là&quot;, allegedly as a reply to Napoleon, who had asked why he hadn&#x27;t mentioned God in his book on astronomy.)
* It is therefore obvious that ... (Frequently used in the &quot;Celestial Mechanics&quot; when he had proved something and mislaid the proof, or found it clumsy. Notorious as a signal for something true, but hard to prove.)
* If we seek a cause wherever we perceive symmetry, it is not that we regard a symmetrical event as less possible than the others, but, since this event ought to be the effect of a regular cause or that of chance, the first of these suppositions is more probable than the second.
* The more extraordinary the event, the greater the need of its being supported by strong proofs.
* &quot;We are so far from knowing all the agents of nature and their diverse modes of action that it would not be philosophical to deny phenomena solely because they are inexplicable in the actual state of our knowledge. But we ought to examine them with an attention all the more scrupulous as it appears more difficult to admit them.&quot;
** This is restated in Theodore Flournoy&#x27;s work &quot;From India to the Planet Mars&quot; as the Principle of Laplace or, &quot;The weight of the evidence should be proportioned to the strangeness of the facts.&quot;
** Most often repeated as &quot;The weight of evidence for an extraordinary claim must be proportioned to its strangeness.&quot; (see also: Sagan standard)
* This simplicity of ratios will not appear astonishing if we consider that all the effects of nature are only mathematical results of a small number of immutable laws.
* Infinitely varied in her effects, nature is only simple in her causes.
* What we know is little, and what we are ignorant of is immense. (Fourier comments: &quot;This was at least the meaning of his last words, which were articulated with difficulty.&quot;)
* One sees in this essay that the theory of probabilities is basically only common sense reduced to a calculus. It makes one estimate accurately what right-minded people feel by a sort of instinct, often without being able to give a reason for it.

<doc id="344787" wikidata="Q1137886" url="?curid=344787" title="South London line">
<text>The South London line is a railway line in inner south London, England. The initial steam passenger service on the route was established by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) on 1 May 1867 when the central London terminal stations of Victoria and London Bridge were connected to the inner south London suburbs of Battersea, Clapham, Brixton, Camberwell and Peckham. A pioneer of overhead electric traction, most of the line was built on high level viaducts and was marketed as the South London Elevated Electric Railway in the early part of the 20th century. The electric service was popular, with four trains per hour and 12 million passengers in 1920. Between Wandsworth Road and Peckham Rye the route ran parallel to another set of tracks. Prior to 1923, both lines from Wandsworth Road to East Brixton were owned by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) and the lines from East Brixton to Peckham Rye were owned by the LBSCR. The southern Atlantic lines were operated by the LBSCR and the northern Chatham lines were operated by the LCDR.

The LBSCR and LCDR were both constituent companies of the Southern Railway (SR) and consequently the whole line came into SR ownership in 1923. Overhead traction was replaced with third rail in 1928. This began a long, slow period of decline that culminated in the running of only nine trains a day in each direction at peak times in 1988. The line was revived following a successful campaign by the South London Line Travellers Association. The full seven day half-hourly timetable was restored in stages from 1991 to 1997. Since December 2012, passenger services have been part of the London Overground, running a four trains an hour service between and and then via the East London line to . In November 2024, the London Overground East London and South London line services were rebranded and named the Windrush line.

== History ==
===Steam service===
The South London line was built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway working in cooperation because both companies desired new lines between Brixton and Peckham. The LCDR wanted to reach Crystal Palace from their existing lines in the Brixton area and the LBSCR wanted to link together their two terminal stations at Victoria and London Bridge via the inner South London suburbs. 

Two parallel sets of railway lines were planned, one pair for the exclusive use of each company. The LBSCR constructed and then owned both pairs of lines between Crow Lane junction in Peckham and Barrington Road junction in Brixton. The LCDR built a line from Barrington Road junction to Wandsworth Road, in effect creating a second pair of tracks adjacent to their existing line, that would be used by the LBSCR.

LBSCR passenger service began on 13 August 1866 between London Bridge and Loughborough Park. It was extended to Victoria on 1 May 1867. During steam service there were typically 37 down (London Bridge to Victoria) and 38 up trains a day. Craven 0-4-2T locomotives were used at first. Later, Stroudley &quot;Terrier&quot; class 0-6-0T engines pulled four wheeled compartment coaches. 

In 1868 a line to Sutton was built that branched off to the west of Peckham Rye. The new route used the South London line to reach London Bridge and significantly increased traffic over the eastern section of line. A third track was provided from Peckham Rye to London Bridge. 

LBSCR service between Old Kent Road and Wapping on the East London Railway commenced in March 1871. Services extended to Liverpool Street in April 1876 and Peckham Rye in 1877. From 1885 the service was cut back to Shoreditch from Liverpool Street.

Grosvenor Road station, just south of the western terminus at Victoria, was open for LBSCR passenger service from 1 November 1870 to 1 April 1907.

===Overhead electric===

The popularity of the service was threatened by the development of the London County Council Tramways electric tram network in South London. Passenger numbers fell from 8 million in 1903 to 3.5 million in 1908. Parliamentary powers to electrify all lines of the LBSCR were obtained in 1903. The LBSCR decided to electrify using the 6.6 kV 25 Hz overhead system. The work was contracted to AEG in 1906. The South London line was selected for electrification first. The initial proposal to electrify only from Peckham Rye to Battersea Park for a test shuttle service was abandoned in favour of electrifying the entire line from London Bridge to Victoria. 

Eight electric three car train sets were initially provided with third class seating in the outer cars and first class in the centre. Side passages ran along the train which enabled passengers to board at any door before finding a seat and improved the punctuality of the service. The first class accommodation was greater than the service required and the centre carriages were transferred to other lines. Two car units were coupled together to form two, four or six coach trains.

The first electric train ran experimentally on 17 January 1909 and in passenger service on 1 December 1909. It was marketed as the South London Elevated Electric Railway. The choice of name was influenced by the existing underground electric railways in London. The service was reported in &quot;The Times&quot; as quicker, in greater comfort and with cheaper fares. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that journey times were cut from 36 to 24 minutes and services ran every 15 minutes. To coincide with the electric service the steam trains that shared the tracks between London Bridge and Peckham Rye were retimed and ran without stopping between those stations.

Steam trains continued to operate early morning services from 04:30 to 07:30 with all-day electric running introduced from 1 June 1912. Passenger numbers were restored to 8 million in 1910 and increased to 12 million in 1920.

Through service from Peckham Rye over the East London Railway ended in June 1911 and the link north of Old Kent Road was abandoned in 1913. Old Kent Road and South Bermondsey stations were closed and Sunday service was withdrawn from East Brixton on 1 January 1917, during the First World War. South Bermondsey reopened on 1 May 1919. 

During overhead AC operation there were typically 68 down (London Bridge to Victoria) and 62 up trains on weekdays with some additional short workings.

===Conversion to third-rail===
After the creation of the Big Four railway companies, the LBSCR became part of the Southern Railway in 1923. Service was withdrawn for four months during the 1926 United Kingdom general strike.

The Southern had more miles of third-rail electrification than overhead line and decided to standardise their network with third-rail. The 660 V DC third-rail system was installed on 17 June 1928.

South Bermondsey station was relocated further south on 17 June 1928 with the island platform built on the site of the lifted third track. 

Following conversion to third-rail DC operation there were typically 42 down (London Bridge to Victoria) and 41 up trains. This reduced the off-peak service to every 30 minutes and every 20 minutes at peak times. Trains were temporarily reduced to hourly during the Second World War.

===Decline and rebirth under British Rail===
The line became part of the Southern Region of British Railways in 1948. 

In 1961 the remaining side platforms were demolished at Peckham Rye and replaced with an island platform built on the site of the long abandoned third track and platform. This was repeated at Queens Road Peckham in 1977 when an island platform was built on the site of the former third track and the side platforms were removed. 

East Brixton station was closed from 6 January 1976. Sunday service was withdrawn from October 1976 with Wandsworth Road, Clapham, Queens Road Peckham and South Bermondsey stations closed on Sundays.

Saturday service was withdrawn in 1981. In May 1984 the weekday off-peak service was withdrawn. 

The South London Line Travellers Association (SoLLTA) was set up in 1987 to lobby for improvements to the line. The service had been reduced to run every half hour only at Monday to Friday peak times. Clapham and Wandsworth Road stations, which were only served by the South London line service, were &quot;reduced to primitive unstaffed halts so you can&#x27;t even buy a ticket&quot; according to SoLLTA.

The line was further reduced to an hourly peak service in June 1988. This gave a service of nine trains a day in each direction. In March 1989 Clapham station was given a &#x27;worst station&#x27; award by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. 

The SoLLTA campaign was successful. Clapham station was renamed Clapham High Street on 15 May 1989, to better reflect its location. It received renovation works in 1990. The other stations were cleaned and refurbished.

Restoration of all-day service was being considered in 1988 as part of a proposal to run a new service from Victoria to Lewisham and beyond. British Rail required a subsidy, but it could not be agreed with the local authorities. A Victoria to Dartford service to provide all day service on the South London line was still being considered in December 1989.

All day half-hourly service was restored from 13 May 1991. It was marketed under the name &quot;South London Link&quot; and a Saturday service was reinstated.

===Privatisation===

Following the privatisation of British Rail, passenger services on the line were provided by Connex South Central from 26 May 1996. The Sunday service was restored in September 1996 and weekday evening service increased from hourly to half-hourly from May 1997.

Southern (initially branded SouthCentral) operated passenger services from 26 August 2001 until 8 December 2012.

===East London line extension===
In 2012, most of the South London line service was incorporated into the London Overground network as part of the East London line extension to Clapham Junction. In the east this was achieved by constructing a line from north of Queens Road Peckham station to join the East London line south of , reinstating an alignment that had been abandoned since 1911. Passenger service was diverted west of Wandsworth Road to serve . This created the route from Surrey Quays to Clapham Junction via , , , and that could be served by the London Overground. Completion was scheduled for May 2012 in time for the London 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games. This was not achieved as the line opened on 9 December 2012. The service connected with the West London line at Clapham Junction, completing an orbital rail route around Central London and fulfilling the Orbirail concept.

The start of London Overground service to Clapham Junction coincided with the withdrawal of the Southern Victoria–London Bridge service. The change reduced or eliminated direct services to the terminals from some stations.

==Route==
The South London line diverges from the London Bridge branch of the Brighton Main Line at South Bermondsey junction on a brick viaduct. The track curves to go from a southeastwards to a southwestwards alignment. South Bermondsey, on an embankment, is the first station immediately south of the junction. The line is joined at Old Kent Road junction by the East London line from Surrey Quays. The line passes the site of the former Old Kent Road station south of the junction and then there is a station at Queens Road Peckham. After passing under the Catford Loop Line the line reaches Peckham Rye where the alignment switches to westwards. The South London line serves the southern pair of four platforms at Peckham Rye station.

After Peckham Rye, the Portsmouth line diverges to the southwest at Peckham Rye junction. Crofton Road junction a little further west allows Catford Loop Line trains to join the South London line, which from this point is also known as the Atlantic lines. After the Grove Lane tunnel, the next station is Denmark Hill where the South London line serves the southern pair of four platforms. The line passes over the Holborn Viaduct–Herne Hill line at Loughborough Junction station and then through the site of the former East Brixton station. The line passes over the Chatham Main Line at Brixton station and has a junction with it at Shepherds Lane. The line heads in a northwestward direction in a shallow cutting. There is a station at Clapham High Street. Voltaire Road junction allows trains to switch between the Atlantic and Chatham lines. 

There is a station at Wandsworth Road and then the line splits into three routes. The first route is the continuation of the Atlantic lines on a brick viaduct, then over the South West Main Line at Queenstown Road and on to Battersea Park station where the route terminates following the removal of the Battersea Park junction with the Victoria branch of the Brighton Main Line. The second route is the connection to Clapham Junction station and the third route is a connection to the Chatham Main Line.

==Services==
The combined East London and South London line service is described by Transport for London as the Highbury &amp; Islington to New Cross, Clapham Junction, Crystal Palace and West Croydon route. As of the December 2023 timetable the typical off-peak service pattern is 16 trains per hour, of which the following run over the South London line for part of the journey:

As of the December 2023 timetable, there are typically four off-peak Southern trains an hour between London Bridge and Peckham Rye calling at South Bermondsey and Queens Road Peckham that continue via the Portsmouth line.

===Renaming===
In July 2023, TfL announced that it would be giving each of the six Overground services unique names by the end of the following year. In February 2024, it was confirmed that the East London / South London section would be named the &quot;Windrush line&quot; (to honour the Windrush generation of immigrants to the area from the Caribbean) and would be coloured red on the updated network map.

==Proposed developments==
=== Addition of New Bermondsey station ===

The East London line extension plans of 2001 proposed a new station at Surrey Canal Road near the Bermondsey/New Cross border. A campaign group was formed in 2009 by Bermondsey residents to press for funding to be made available. In September 2010, the £7 million funding was refused by the Department for Transport, which Property developer Renewal in 2012 agreed to fund as part of a development scheme and Lewisham Council accordingly granted planning permission. During a presentation at the site as part of the Open House 2014 weekend, Renewal announced a process of choosing a more recognizable name was underway with TfL. The decision reached for this part of the former south London dockyards is &quot;New Bermondsey&quot;. Construction work began in 2016.

===Victoria to Bellingham service===
The removal of the Victoria to London Bridge service in 2012 eliminated a single seat ride from some South London line stations to the terminals. A demonstration took place to restore the route during the month when the route changed. A survey by London Travelwatch found that 88% of passengers on the line felt they would be inconvenienced by the changes (although the survey also noted that respondents were generally unaware of the East London line/Overground proposals or of any possible benefits they might bring).

To compensate for the loss of services, it was proposed to introduce a Victoria- service. This would restore the old route to Peckham Rye and take in part of the Catford Loop Line, to Bellingham in south-east London. The proposal was abandoned due to funding issues.

Pressure groups and local MPs urged the Mayor to reconsider who secured funding in principle from the Secretary of State for Transport for greater line use or branches to be added. TfL compiled a shortlist of proposals to address the upset in commuting times.

===Lobbying for further additional stations===
Between Denmark Hill and Clapham High Street, the line passes through Brixton, crossing over and stations but without its own stations. In 1991, adding platforms at Brixton was identified as a potential revenue generator for the South Central division, but the cost to build was considered prohibitively expensive.

In 2004, concerns were raised by local politicians and residents that the Brixton area was not being served by the line and campaigners criticised the East London line Extension project for missing opportunities to create interchange stations with Thameslink and the London Underground Victoria line.

Plans were not produced for such stations as the line is on a high viaduct, increasing the costs prohibitively. The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, expressed doubts that any proposals to construct these stations would pass a cost-benefit analysis and that they would be unlikely to be approved. Lambeth Council and the East London line Group have expressed support for an interchange station at Brixton and have requested that this proposal be considered for future funding. Suggestions have been made that East Brixton station could be re-opened as an alternative.

<text>Priszm LP was the largest operator of Canadian fast food restaurants. The Priszm Income Fund, an income trust, owned 60.2% of Priszm.

Priszm was one of the largest franchisees of Yum! Brands in the world, owning over 746 restaurants of various Yum!-owned chains in Canada, namely KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and WingStreet. The majority of its locations were KFC restaurants, some of which are co-branded with the Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands. Priszm was also responsible for KFC&#x27;s national marketing and promotions within Canada from 2003 to 2009. The close relationship between the two companies extends to sharing the same Canadian headquarters in Vaughan, Ontario.

All stores have been sold to date and Priszm closed its operations in late 2012.

<doc id="344792" wikidata="Q99573734" url="?curid=344792" title="Western subalpine warbler">
<text>The western subalpine warbler (Curruca iberiae) is a small typical warbler which breeds in the southernmost areas of Europe and north-western Africa.

Like most &quot;Curruca&quot; species, it has distinct male and female plumages. The adult male has a grey back and head, brick-red underparts, and white malar streaks (&quot;moustaches&quot;). The female is mainly brown above, with a greyer head, and whitish below with a pink flush. The subalpine warbler&#x27;s song is fast and rattling, and is similar to the lesser whitethroat.

This bird seems to be related to the Sardinian warbler–Menetries&#x27; warbler superspecies. They all have white malar areas, the heads being dark above in adult males, and naked eye-rings. These three species are related to a superspecies consisting of Rüppell&#x27;s warbler and the Cyprus warbler, which also share the white malar area with blackish above (Shirihai et al. 2001, Jønsson &amp; Fjeldså 2006 ).
The subalpine warbler is divided into two distinct subspecies groups, which may possibly be sufficiently diverged to qualify as two separate species (Shirihai et al. 2001). The two groups have differing male plumages, distinctive calls, and are allopatric; further study is needed. In May 2020, the IOC world bird list the western and eastern subalpine warblers were split into two distinct species.

This is a bird of dry open country, often on hill slopes, with bushes for nesting. The nest is built in low shrub or gorse, and 3–5 eggs are laid. Like most &quot;warblers&quot;, it is insectivorous, but will also take berries.

== Habitat and ecology ==
This species prefers tall and dense heterogeneous maquis with sparse tree cover in dry Mediterranean areas, particularly maquis of holm oak (&quot;Quercus ilex&quot;) and those dominated by strawberry tree (&quot;Arbutus&quot;) and tree-heath (&quot;Erica&quot;). It is also frequently found in young cork oak (&quot;Quercus suber&quot;) forest and in dense but treeless bushy areas. It uses bushy formations dominated by brambles (&quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot;) along sunny ravines and valley bottoms and prefers the intermediate stages of post-wildfire succession. Breeding occurs from late March to late June and the species is monogamous. The male constructs several &#x27;cock nests&#x27; but both sexes build the breeding nest which is a deep, robust cup of grasses, thin roots and leaves and lined with finer grasses, rootlets and hair. It is placed in low scrub, bush or a small tree, c. 30–130 cm above the ground. Clutches are three to five eggs. The diet is mostly small insects and their larvae but outside of the breeding season berries and fruits are also taken. The species is a long-distance migrant, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Aymí et al. 2015).

<doc id="344793" wikidata="Q44666" url="?curid=344793" title="Laplace's demon">
<text>In the history of science, Laplace&#x27;s demon was a notable published articulation of causal determinism on a scientific basis by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1814. According to determinism, if someone (the demon) knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, their past and future values for any given time are entailed; they can be calculated from the laws of classical mechanics.

Discoveries and theories in the decades following suggest that some elements of Laplace&#x27;s original writing are wrong or incompatible with our universe. For example, irreversible processes in thermodynamics suggest that Laplace&#x27;s &quot;demon&quot; could not reconstruct past positions and moments from the current state: A metal rod heated at one end will equilibrate to the same end temperature across the bar regardless of which side was initially heated; reconstructing the initial state from the final state is therefore impossible as multiple initial states all share the same final state. 

==English translation==

This intellect is often referred to as &quot;Laplace&#x27;s demon&quot; (and sometimes &quot;Laplace&#x27;s Superman&quot;, after Hans Reichenbach). Laplace himself did not use the word &quot;demon&quot;, which was a later embellishment. As translated into English above, he simply referred to: &quot;Une intelligence ... Rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et l&#x27;avenir, comme le passé, serait présent à ses yeux.&quot; This idea seems to have been widespread around the time that Laplace first expressed it in 1773, particularly in France. Variations can be found in Maupertuis (1756), Nicolas de Condorcet (1768), Baron D&#x27;Holbach (1770), and an undated fragment in the archives of Diderot. Recent scholarship suggests that the image of a super-powerful calculating intelligence was also proposed by Roger Joseph Boscovich in his 1758 &quot;Theoria philosophiae naturalis&quot;.

==Arguments against Laplace&#x27;s demon==
===Thermodynamic irreversibility===
According to chemical engineer Robert Ulanowicz in his 1986 book &quot;Growth and Development&quot;, Laplace&#x27;s demon met its end with early 19th century developments of the concepts of irreversibility, entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics. In other words, Laplace&#x27;s demon was based on the premise of reversibility and classical mechanics; however, Ulanowicz points out that many thermodynamic processes are irreversible, so that if thermodynamic quantities are taken to be purely physical then no such demon is possible as one could not reconstruct past positions and momenta from the current state.

Maximum entropy thermodynamics takes a very different view, considering thermodynamic variables to have a statistical basis which is separate from the deterministic microscopic physics. However, this theory has met criticism regarding its ability to make predictions about physics; a number of physicists and mathematicians, including Yvan Velenik of the Department of Mathematics for the University of Geneva, have pointed out that maximum entropy thermodynamics essentially describes our knowledge about a system but does not describe the system itself.

===Quantum mechanical irreversibility===
Due to its canonical assumption of determinism, Laplace&#x27;s demon is incompatible with the Copenhagen interpretation, which stipulates indeterminacy. The interpretation of quantum mechanics is still very much open for debate and there are many who take opposing views (such as the many worlds interpretation and the de Broglie–Bohm interpretation).

===Chaos theory===
Chaos theory is sometimes pointed out as a contradiction to Laplace&#x27;s demon: it describes how a deterministic system can nonetheless exhibit behavior that is impossible to predict: as in the butterfly effect, minor variations between the starting conditions of two systems can result in major differences. While this explains unpredictability in practical cases, applying it to Laplace&#x27;s case is questionable: under the strict demon hypothesis all details are known—to infinite precision—and therefore variations in starting conditions are non-existent. Put another way: Chaos theory is applicable when knowledge of the system is imperfect, whereas Laplace&#x27;s demon assumes perfect knowledge of the system, therefore the variability leading to chaos in chaos theory and non-variability in the knowledge of the world Laplace&#x27;s demon holds are noncomparable.

===Cantor diagonalization ===
In 2008, David Wolpert used Cantor diagonalization to challenge the idea of Laplace&#x27;s demon. He did this by assuming that the demon is a computational device and showed that no two such devices can completely predict each other. Wolpert&#x27;s paper was cited in 2014 in a paper of Josef Rukavicka, where a significantly simpler argument is presented that disproves Laplace&#x27;s demon using Turing machines, under the assumption of free will.

==Additional context==
In full context, Laplace&#x27;s demon, as conceived, is infinitely removed from the human mind and thus could never assist humanity&#x27;s efforts at prediction:

Despite this, the English physicist Stephen Hawking said in his book &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; that &quot;Laplace suggested that there should be a set of scientific laws that would allow us to predict everything that would happen in the universe.&quot;

Similarly, in James Gleick&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, the author appears to conflate Laplace&#x27;s demon with a &quot;dream&quot; for human deterministic predictability, and even states that &quot;Laplace seems almost buffoon-like in his optimism, but much of modern science has pursued his dream&quot; (pg.14).

==Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox==
Recently, Laplace&#x27;s demon has been invoked to resolve a famous paradox of statistical physics, Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox. The argument is that, in order to reverse all velocities in a gas system, measurements must be performed by what effectively becomes a Laplace&#x27;s demon. This, in conjunction with Landauer&#x27;s principle, allows a way out of the paradox.

==Recent views==
There has recently been proposed a limit on the computational power of the universe, i.e. the ability of Laplace&#x27;s demon to process an infinite amount of information. The limit is based on the maximum entropy of the universe, the speed of light, and the minimum amount of time taken to move information across the Planck length, and the figure was shown to be about 10120 bits. Accordingly, anything that requires more than this amount of data cannot be computed in the amount of time that has elapsed so far in the universe. A simple logical proof of the impossibility of Laplace&#x27;s idea was advanced in 2012 by Iegor Reznikoff, who posits that the demon cannot predict his own future memory.

<text>Charles Shadwell ( 1710 – died 1726) was an English playwright of the 18th century, date of birth unknown. He was the son of Thomas Shadwell, the playwright and Poet Laureate.

He served in the army during the War of the Spanish Succession, before becoming the supervisor of the excise in Kent.

Shadwell was the author of the comedy &quot;The Fair Quaker of Deal&quot; staged at the Drury Lane Theatre in London in 1710 and &quot;The Humours of the Army&quot; (1713).

From 1715 to 1720 he was the resident playwright at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, the leading Irish theatre at the time. In 1719, his tragedy &quot;Rotherick O&#x27;Connor, King of Connaught&quot; was staged at Smock Alley, and with the comedy &quot;Irish Hospitality&quot;, and other plays, collected and published in 1720.

<text>The Cyprus warbler (Curruca melanothorax) is a typical warbler which breeds only on Cyprus. This small passerine bird is a short-distance migrant, and winters in Israel, Jordan and Egypt.

Like most &quot;Curruca&quot; species, it has distinct male and female plumages. The adult male is a small typical warbler with a grey back, black head, white malar streaks (&quot;moustaches&quot;), and, uniquely among typical warblers, underparts heavily streaked with black. The female is mainly grey above, with a greyer head, and whitish with only light spotting. The Cyprus warbler&#x27;s song is fast and rattling, and is similar to that of the Sardinian warbler.

Together with Rüppell&#x27;s warbler it forms a superspecies with dark throats, white malar streaks and light remigial fringes. This in turn is related to the species of Mediterranean and Middle East &quot;Curruca&quot; warblers that have a naked eye-ring, namely the eastern subalpine warbler, Sardinian warbler and Menetries&#x27;s warbler. Both groups have a white malar area, but this may not form a clear streak in the latter group; above the white, the heads of males are uniformly dark.(The Sylvia Monograph, A &amp; C Black, London; Jønsson &amp; Fjeldså 2006)

This is a bird of dry open country, often on hill slopes, with bushes for nesting. The nest is built in low shrub or gorse, and 3–5 eggs are laid. Like most &quot;warblers&quot;, it is insectivorous, but will also take berries.

<text>In computer programming, an assignment statement sets and/or re-sets the value stored in the storage location(s) denoted by a variable name; in other words, it copies a value into the variable. In most imperative programming languages, the assignment statement (or expression) is a fundamental construct.

Today, the most commonly used notation for this operation is codice_1 (originally Superplan 1949–51, popularized by Fortran 1957 and C). The second most commonly used notation is codice_2 (originally ALGOL 1958, popularised by Pascal). Many other notations are also in use. In some languages, the symbol used is regarded as an operator (meaning that the assignment statement as a whole returns a value). Other languages define assignment as a statement (meaning that it cannot be used in an expression).

Assignments typically allow a variable to hold different values at different times during its life-span and scope. However, some languages (primarily strictly functional languages) do not allow that kind of &quot;destructive&quot; reassignment, as it might imply changes of non-local state. The purpose is to enforce referential transparency, i.e. functions that do not depend on the state of some variable(s), but produce the same results for a given set of parametric inputs at any point in time. Modern programs in other languages also often use similar strategies, although less strict, and only in certain parts, in order to reduce complexity, normally in conjunction with complementing methodologies such as data structuring, structured programming and object orientation.

==Semantics==
An assignment operation is a process in imperative programming in which different values are associated with a particular variable name as time passes. The program, in such model, operates by changing its state using successive assignment statements. Primitives of imperative programming languages rely on assignment to do iteration. At the lowest level, assignment is implemented using machine operations such as codice_3 or codice_4.

Variables are containers for values. It is possible to put a value into a variable and later replace it with a new one. An assignment operation modifies the current state of the executing program. Consequently, assignment is dependent on the concept of variables. In an assignment:

* The codice_5 is evaluated in the current state of the program.
* The codice_6 is assigned the computed value, replacing the prior value of that variable.

Example: Assuming that codice_7 is a numeric variable, the assignment codice_8 means that the content of the variable codice_7 is doubled after the execution of the statement.

An example segment of C code:
int x = 10; 
float y;
x = 23;
y = 32.4f;
In this sample, the variable codice_10 is first declared as an int, and is then assigned the value of 10. Notice that the declaration and assignment occur in the same statement. In the second line, codice_11 is declared without an assignment. In the third line, codice_10 is reassigned the value of 23. Finally, codice_11 is assigned the value of 32.4.

For an assignment operation, it is necessary that the value of the codice_5 is well-defined (it is a valid rvalue) and that the codice_6 represents a modifiable entity (it is a valid modifiable (non-const) lvalue). In some languages, typically dynamic ones, it is not necessary to declare a variable prior to assigning it a value. In such languages, a variable is automatically declared the first time it is assigned to, with the scope it is declared in varying by language.

==Single assignment==
Any assignment that changes an existing value (e.g. codice_16) is disallowed in purely functional languages. In functional programming, assignment is discouraged in favor of single assignment, more commonly known as &quot;initialization&quot;. Single assignment is an example of name binding and differs from assignment as described in this article in that it can only be done once, usually when the variable is created; no subsequent reassignment is allowed.

An evaluation of an expression does not have a side effect if it does not change an observable state of the machine, other than producing the result, and always produces same value for the same input. Imperative assignment can introduce side effects while destroying and making the old value unavailable while substituting it with a new one, and is referred to as &quot;destructive assignment&quot; for that reason in LISP and functional programming, similar to destructive updating.

Single assignment is the only form of assignment available in purely functional languages, such as Haskell, which do not have variables in the sense of imperative programming languages but rather named constant values possibly of compound nature, with their elements progressively defined &quot;on-demand&quot;, for the lazy languages. Purely functional languages can provide an opportunity for computation to be performed in parallel, avoiding the von Neumann bottleneck of sequential one step at a time execution, since values are independent of each other.

Impure functional languages provide both single assignment as well as true assignment (though true assignment is typically used with less frequency than in imperative programming languages). For example, in Scheme, both single assignment (with codice_17) and true assignment (with codice_18) can be used on all variables, and specialized primitives are provided for destructive update inside lists, vectors, strings, etc. In OCaml, only single assignment is allowed for variables, via the codice_19 syntax; however destructive update can be used on elements of arrays and strings with separate codice_20 operator, as well as on fields of records and objects that have been explicitly declared mutable (meaning capable of being changed after their initial declaration) by the programmer.

Functional programming languages that use single assignment include Clojure (for data structures, not vars), Erlang (it accepts multiple assignment if the values are equal, in contrast to Haskell), F#, Haskell, JavaScript (for constants), Lava, OCaml, Oz (for dataflow variables, not cells), Racket (for some data structures like lists, not symbols), SASL, Scala (for vals), SISAL, Standard ML. Non-backtracking Prolog code can be considered &quot;explicit&quot; single-assignment, explicit in a sense that its (named) variables can be in explicitly unassigned state, or be set exactly once. In Haskell, by contrast, there can be no unassigned variables, and every variable can be thought of as being implicitly set, when it is created, to its value (or rather to a computational object that will produce its value &quot;on demand&quot;).

==Value of an assignment==
In some programming languages, an assignment statement returns a value, while in others it does not.

In most expression-oriented programming languages (for example, C), the assignment statement returns the assigned value, allowing such idioms as codice_21, in which the assignment statement codice_22 returns the value of codice_7, which is then assigned to codice_10. In a statement such as , the return value of a function is used to control a loop while assigning that same value to a variable.

In other programming languages, Scheme for example, the return value of an assignment is undefined and such idioms are invalid.

In Haskell, there is no variable assignment; but operations similar to assignment (like assigning to a field of an array or a field of a mutable data structure) usually evaluate to the unit type, which is represented as codice_25. This type has only one possible value, therefore containing no information. It is typically the type of an expression that is evaluated purely for its side effects.

==Variant forms of assignment==
Certain use patterns are very common, and thus often have special syntax to support them. These are primarily syntactic sugar to reduce redundancy in the source code, but also assists readers of the code in understanding the programmer&#x27;s intent, and provides the compiler with a clue to possible optimization.

===Augmented assignment===

The case where the assigned value depends on a previous one is so common that many imperative languages, most notably C and the majority of its descendants, provide special operators called augmented assignment, like codice_26, so codice_27 can instead be written as codice_28. Beyond syntactic sugar, this assists the task of the compiler by making clear that in-place modification of the variable codice_7 is possible.

===Chained assignment===
A statement like codice_30 is called a chained assignment in which the value of codice_31 is assigned to multiple variables codice_32 and codice_11. Chained assignments are often used to initialize multiple variables, as in

codice_34

Not all programming languages support chained assignment. Chained assignments are equivalent to a sequence of assignments, but the evaluation strategy differs between languages. For simple chained assignments, like initializing multiple variables, the evaluation strategy does not matter, but if the targets (l-values) in the assignment are connected in some way, the evaluation strategy affects the result.

In some programming languages (C for example), chained assignments are supported because assignments are expressions, and have values. In this case chain assignment can be implemented by having a right-associative assignment, and assignments happen right-to-left. For example, codice_35 is equivalent to codice_36. In C++ they are also available for values of class types by declaring the appropriate return type for the assignment operator.

In Python, assignment statements are not expressions and thus do not have a value. Instead, chained assignments are a series of statements with multiple targets for a single expression. The assignments are executed left-to-right so that codice_35 evaluates the expression codice_38, then assigns the result to the leftmost target, codice_39, and then assigns the same result to the next target, codice_40, using the new value of codice_39. This is essentially equivalent to codice_42 though no actual variable is produced for the temporary value.

===Parallel assignment===
Some programming languages, such as APL, Common Lisp, Go, JavaScript (since 1.7), Julia, PHP, Maple, Lua, occam 2, Perl, Python, REBOL, Ruby, and PowerShell allow several variables to be assigned in parallel, with syntax like:

 a, b := 0, 1

which simultaneously assigns 0 to codice_7 and 1 to codice_44. This is most often known as parallel assignment; it was introduced in CPL in 1963, under the name simultaneous assignment, and is sometimes called multiple assignment, though this is confusing when used with &quot;single assignment&quot;, as these are not opposites. If the right-hand side of the assignment is a single variable (e.g. an array or structure), the feature is called unpacking or destructuring assignment:

 var list := {0, 1}
 a, b := list

The list will be unpacked so that 0 is assigned to codice_7 and 1 to codice_44. Furthermore,

 a, b := b, a

swaps the values of codice_7 and codice_44. In languages without parallel assignment, this would have to be written to use a temporary variable

 var t := a
 a := b
 b := t

since codice_49 leaves both codice_7 and codice_44 with the original value of codice_44.

Some languages, such as Go, F# and Python, combine parallel assignment, tuples, and automatic to allow multiple return values from a single function, as in this Python example,
def f():
 return 1, 2
a, b = f()
while other languages, such as C# and Rust, shown here, require explicit tuple construction and deconstruction with parentheses:
// Valid C# or Rust syntax
(a, b) = (b, a);

// C# tuple return
(string, int) f() =&gt; (&quot;foo&quot;, 1);
var (a, b) = f();

// Rust tuple return
let f = || (&quot;foo&quot;, 1);
let (a, b) = f();
This provides an alternative to the use of output parameters for returning multiple values from a function. This dates to CLU (1974), and CLU helped popularize parallel assignment generally.

C# additionally allows generalized &quot;deconstruction assignment&quot; with implementation defined by the expression on the right-hand side, as the compiler searches for an appropriate instance or extension codice_53 method on the expression, which must have output parameters for the variables being assigned to. For example, one such method that would give the class it appears in the same behavior as the return value of codice_38 above would be

void Deconstruct(out string a, out int b) { a = &quot;foo&quot;; b = 1; }
In C and C++, the comma operator is similar to parallel assignment in allowing multiple assignments to occur within a single statement, writing codice_55 instead of codice_56. 
This is primarily used in for loops, and is replaced by parallel assignment in other languages such as Go.
However, the above C++ code does not ensure perfect simultaneity, since the right side of the following code codice_57 is evaluated after the left side. In languages such as Python, codice_58 will assign the two variables concurrently, using the initial value of a to compute the new b.

==Assignment versus equality==

The use of the equals sign codice_59 as an assignment operator has been frequently criticized, due to the conflict with equals as comparison for equality. This results both in confusion by novices in writing code, and confusion even by experienced programmers in reading code. The use of equals for assignment dates back to Heinz Rutishauser&#x27;s language Superplan, designed from 1949 to 1951, and was particularly popularized by Fortran:
Beginning programmers sometimes confuse assignment with the relational operator for equality, as &quot;=&quot; means equality in mathematics, and is used for assignment in many languages. But assignment alters the value of a variable, while equality testing tests whether two expressions have the same value.

In some languages, such as BASIC, a single equals sign (codice_60) is used for both the assignment operator and the equality relational operator, with context determining which is meant. Other languages use different symbols for the two operators. For example:

* In ALGOL and Pascal, the assignment operator is a colon and an equals sign (codice_61) while the equality operator is a single equals (codice_60).
* In C, the assignment operator is a single equals sign (codice_60) while the equality operator is a pair of equals signs (codice_64).
* In R, the assignment operator is basically codice_20, as in codice_66, but a single equals sign can be used in certain contexts.

The similarity in the two symbols can lead to errors if the programmer forgets which form (&quot;codice_59&quot;, &quot;codice_68&quot;, &quot;codice_69&quot;) is appropriate, or mistypes &quot;codice_59&quot; when &quot;codice_68&quot; was intended. This is a common programming problem with languages such as C (including one famous attempt to backdoor the Linux kernel), where the assignment operator also returns the value assigned (in the same way that a function returns a value), and can be validly nested inside expressions. If the intention was to compare two values in an codice_72 statement, for instance, an assignment is quite likely to return a value interpretable as Boolean true, in which case the codice_73 clause will be executed, leading the program to behave unexpectedly. Some language processors (such as gcc) can detect such situations, and warn the programmer of the potential error.

==Notation==

The two most common representations for the copying assignment are equals sign (codice_59) and colon-equals (codice_69). Both forms may semantically denote either an assignment &quot;statement&quot; or an assignment &quot;operator&quot; (which also has a value), depending on language and/or usage.

Other possibilities include a left arrow or a keyword, though there are other, rarer, variants:

Mathematical pseudo code assignments are generally depicted with a left-arrow.

Some platforms put the expression on the left and the variable on the right:

Some expression-oriented languages, such as Lisp and Tcl, uniformly use prefix (or postfix) syntax for all statements, including assignment.

<doc id="344815" wikidata="Q1530724" url="?curid=344815" title="Glen Canyon Dam">
<text>Glen Canyon Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam in the southwestern United States, located on the Colorado River in northern Arizona, near the city of Page. The  dam was built by the Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) from 1956 to 1966 and forms Lake Powell, one of the largest man-made reservoirs in the U.S. with a capacity of more than . The dam is named for Glen Canyon, a series of deep sandstone gorges now flooded by the reservoir; Lake Powell is named for John Wesley Powell, who in 1869 led the first expedition to traverse the Colorado River&#x27;s Grand Canyon by boat.

A dam in Glen Canyon was studied as early as 1924, but these plans were initially dropped in favor of the Hoover Dam (completed in 1936) which was located in the Black Canyon. By the 1950s, due to rapid population growth in the seven U.S. and two Mexican states comprising the Colorado River Basin, the Bureau of Reclamation deemed the construction of additional reservoirs necessary. The Glen Canyon Dam remains a central issue for modern environmentalist movements. Beginning in the late 1990s, the Sierra Club and other organizations renewed the call to dismantle the dam and drain Lake Powell in Lower Glen Canyon. Glen Canyon and Lake Powell are managed by the Department of the Interior within Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.

Since first filling to capacity in 1980, Lake Powell water levels have fluctuated greatly depending on water demand and annual runoff. The operation of Glen Canyon Dam helps ensure an equitable distribution of water between the states of the Upper Colorado River Basin (Colorado, Wyoming, and most of New Mexico and Utah) and the Lower Basin (California, Nevada and most of Arizona). During years of drought, Glen Canyon guarantees a water delivery to the Lower Basin states, without the need for rationing in the Upper Basin. In wet years, it captures extra runoff for future use. The dam is also a major source of hydroelectricity, averaging over 4 billion kilowatt hours per year. The long and winding Lake Powell, known for its scenic beauty and recreational opportunities including houseboating, fishing and water skiing, attracts millions of tourists each year to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.

In addition to its flooding of the scenic Glen Canyon, the dam&#x27;s economic justification was questioned by some critics. It became &quot;a catalyst for the modern environmental movement,&quot; and was one of the last dams of its size to be built in the United States. The dam has been criticized for the large evaporative losses from Lake Powell and its impact on the ecology of the Grand Canyon, which lies downstream; environmental groups continue to advocate for the dam&#x27;s removal. Water managers and utilities state that the dam is a major source of renewable energy and provides a buffer for severe droughts.
==Background==
===The need for a dam===
The Colorado River is the single largest source of water in the southwestern United States and northwest Mexico; before massive dam projects tamed the river in the 20th century, its flow was far from dependable. Annual discharge from the Colorado River and its tributaries ranges from , and 10-year averages may fluctuate as much as . Flooding, and the river&#x27;s enormous silt or sediment load, created problems for settlements in the Lower Colorado River Valley and navigation on the lower portion of the river. During droughts, there was too little water available for irrigation. In 1904, the Colorado River was accidentally redirected after it damaged a canal gate in Mexico, causing the river to flood part of California&#x27;s Imperial Valley and create the Salton Sea. After this catastrophe, California and Arizona began to call for a dam to control the tempestuous river.
In 1922, six U.S. states signed the Colorado River Compact to officially allocate the flow of the Colorado River and its tributaries. Each half of the Colorado River Basin—the Upper Basin, comprising Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming—and the Lower Basin, with California and Nevada—was allotted of water annually, and Treaty relating to the utilization of waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande was signed in 1944 allocating to Mexico. The third lower basin state, Arizona, did not ratify the Compact until 1944 because it was concerned that California might seek to appropriate a portion of its share before it could be put to use.

The total, , was based on only thirty years of streamflow records starting in the late 1890s. It was believed to represent the annual flow as measured at Lee&#x27;s Ferry, Arizona (the official dividing point of the upper and lower basins), downstream of present-day Glen Canyon Dam. As it turned out, the early 20th century was one of the wettest periods in the last 800 years. The dependable natural flow past Lees Ferry is now believed to be about .

The general consensus among inhabitants of the Colorado River basin and government officials was that a high dam had to be built on the Colorado to control floods and provide carry-over water storage for times of drought. Possible locations for this dam were debated for years, and the Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s first study for a dam at Glen Canyon was made in 1924, in addition to studies for locations at Black and Boulder Canyons lower on the Colorado, below Grand Canyon. These studies found that the lower Colorado sites had stronger foundation rock which might result in less reservoir seepage. The Glen Canyon site was so remote that delivering supplies and transporting workers there would be infeasible at the time. The first Glen Canyon proposal lay upstream of the Lee&#x27;s Ferry dividing line, and would be considered the Upper Basin&#x27;s water. With its substantial Congressional clout, California refused to allow the &quot;virtual faucets&quot; of a Colorado River dam &quot;to be built in what amounted to hostile territory.&quot;

With the Glen Canyon site out of the question, the initial need for a reservoir was realized in 1936 with the completion of Hoover Dam in Black Canyon, storing in the mammoth reservoir of Lake Mead. It was not able to weather the worst floods or droughts, and was filling with sediment at a rate that would render it useless in a few hundred years. But most importantly, Hoover only controlled the lower portion of the river. The Upper Basin states, whose rivers remained undammed, had no way to ensure they could fulfill their delivery obligation to the Lower Basin states while retaining enough water for their own use. Without storage reservoirs of their own, the Upper Basin states risked a &quot;call&quot; on the Colorado River during drought years: they would be forced to use less water in order to keep the river flowing to Lake Mead and California, the state with the most senior water rights.

===Colorado River Storage Project===

To provide water for the Upper Basin and ensure delivery to the Lower Basin, the Bureau of Reclamation proposed the Colorado River Storage Project, which would consist of a dam on the Colorado River at Glen Canyon, several dams on the Gunnison River and San Juan River, and a pair of dams to be built on the Green River, the Colorado&#x27;s major upper tributary, at Echo Park and Split Mountain. The 1956 Colorado River Storage Project Act authorized the purposes of &quot;regulating the flow of the Colorado River, storing water for beneficial consumptive use, providing for reclamation of arid and semi-arid lands, providing flood control, and generating hydropower.&quot;

The proposal for Glen Canyon Dam was most vocally supported by the state of Arizona, which wished to get Colorado River water to Phoenix and Tucson, located hundreds of miles away from the Colorado in the center of the state. Glen Canyon Dam would regulate river flow between Lee&#x27;s Ferry and Lake Mead, where the Colorado drops some , allowing the future construction of two additional hydroelectric dams, at Marble Canyon and Bridge Canyon. These two dams would be partially inside Grand Canyon National Park. Glen, Marble and Bridge together would provide the power necessary to pump water to where it was needed in central Arizona. In 1963, Arizona&#x27;s congressional delegation proposed these dams as part of the Central Arizona Project to accomplish these goals. The state of California opposed the project, as it would eliminate the &quot;surplus&quot; water in the Colorado (really the Upper Basin&#x27;s yet unused supplies) it had gotten accustomed to using.

The Bureau of Reclamation recognized a more serious problem. Construction of the Storage Project, and allowing the Upper Basin to develop its water supplies, would tip the whole Colorado River system toward a structural water deficit since the Colorado River&#x27;s average flow is less than what was apportioned in the 1922 Compact. The USBR predicted that by 2030 the annual water supply for the Lower Basin would fall by twenty-five percent, to . To make up for this deficit, the USBR incorporated these proposals with the &quot;Pacific Southwest Water Plan&quot; on January 21, 1964, in which power sales from Glen, Marble and Bridge (often called &quot;cash register dams&quot;) would be used to fund a diversion of water from the wetter Pacific Northwest to the Colorado Basin. In addition to the proposed diversion of the Trinity River in Northern California, Marc Reisner wrote in &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot; that &quot;in the Pacific Northwest there was a lot of suspicion that the Pacific Southwest Water Plan was merely a smokescreen for a much larger plan, long a gleam in the Colorado Basin&#x27;s eye, to tap the Columbia River.&quot;

===Environmental concerns ===

The Echo Park dam would be inside the federally protected Dinosaur National Monument and would submerge of scenic canyons – a move that alarmed environmentalists. The environmental organization Sierra Club, led by David Brower, was the most vocal opponent of Echo Park Dam, and fought a protracted battle against the Bureau of Reclamation, on the basis that &quot;building the dam would not only destroy a unique wilderness area, but would set a terrible precedent for exploiting resources in America&#x27;s national parks and monuments&quot;.

The Bureau of Reclamation favored the Echo Park site over Glen Canyon, because its narrow canyons and high elevation (more than , as compared to at Glen Canyon) would lead to less evaporation. It said that building Echo Park Dam and a &quot;low&quot; Glen Canyon Dam would save of water per year over a &quot;high&quot; Glen Canyon Dam (which was ultimately the version to be built). While studying the figures, Brower discovered that the difference should be no more than . Although it is unclear whether the discrepancy was due to a miscalculation or intentional manipulation, Brower said &quot;it would be a great mistake [to rely on the Bureau&#x27;s figures] when they cannot add, subtract, multiply and divide.&quot;

In the face of public scrutiny, and wishing to avoid more questions about the Colorado River Storage Project as a whole, the Bureau of Reclamation dropped the Echo Park proposal in 1954. Even as construction began on the other dams, the drama of the Echo Park debate had shifted the American public&#x27;s perception on big government projects and their environmental consequences. Echo Park was considered a victory for the American environmental movement, but it only happened in exchange for a dam upstream at Flaming Gorge, and increasing the size of the proposed dam at Glen Canyon to replace the storage that would have been provided by Echo Park. A common misconception is that the environmentalists were given a choice between damming Echo Park and damming Glen Canyon, but the USBR &quot;had always planned to build a dam at Glen Canyon, regardless of the outcome of the Echo Park debate&quot;.

Floyd Dominy, commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, was a vital figure in pushing the project through Congress and convincing politicians to take a pro-dam stance, and to assuage rising public concerns. Dominy realized that the USBR had considerable political clout in Western states, due to the economic contributions of its water projects. Reisner wrote that &quot;Dominy cultivated Congress as if he were tending prize-winning orchids  ... If some Senator was causing him trouble, money for his project could disappear mighty fast.&quot; With the necessary political support secured, the Colorado River Storage Project was authorized in April 1956, and groundbreaking of Glen Canyon Dam began in October of the same year.

David Brower visited Glen Canyon shortly after the decision to build the dam, and &quot;realized once he arrived that this was not a place for a reservoir&quot;. Glen Canyon&#x27;s springs, side canyons, and intricately sculpted rock formations were home to such features as Music Temple and Cathedral in the Desert, a giant cave-like natural amphitheater with a waterfall at its center. The Colorado River flowed gently across the bottom of the canyon, in sharp contrast to the roaring rapids upstream in Cataract Canyon and downstream in the Grand Canyon. After his groundbreaking 1869 expedition, John Wesley Powell had named Glen Canyon for its characteristics: &quot;So we have a curious ensemble of wonderful features – carved walls, royal arches, glens, alcove gulches, mounds and monuments. From which of these features shall we select a name? We decide to call it Glen Canyon.&quot; In addition to its variegated rock formations, Glen Canyon supported a rich riparian zone habitat on the numerous low river terraces formed by the Colorado River, with as many as 316 bird species, 79 plant species and 34 kinds of mammals.
In 1963, when construction on the dam was well underway, the Sierra Club published a book on Glen Canyon, &quot;The Place No One Knew&quot;, featuring photographs by Eliot Porter, and lamenting the loss of the canyon before most of the American public had a chance to visit, or were even aware of its existence. Though little known to most Americans before Porter&#x27;s book, Glen Canyon had been visited by a handful of hikers and boaters (such as Powell&#x27;s expedition), and some had even been interviewed by Brower. As said to Brower by writer Wallace Stegner, who had been to the canyon in 1947, &quot;Echo doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Glen.&quot;

Emboldened by Echo Park and desperate to prevent the Grand Canyon from reaching the same fate as Glen, Brower and the Sierra Club directed attention towards the proposed Bridge and Marble dams. The Sierra Club launched an extensive publicity campaign to sway public opinion against the plan; in response to the USBR&#x27;s argument that new reservoirs would open up the Grand Canyon to recreational boaters as Lake Powell had, a full-page advertisement in the &quot;New York Times&quot; ran the slogan: &quot;Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can float nearer the ceiling?&quot; Faced with public outcry, the Bureau abandoned its Grand Canyon dams, effectively terminating most of the Pacific Southwest Water Plan, in 1968. The coal-fired Navajo Generating Station was built near Page, to make up for the electric power that was lost with the cancellation of the dam project. The Sierra Club lost its IRS tax-exempt status a day after the advertisement was released due to its disruptive political activities. The group&#x27;s membership more than doubled in the next three years, many of them citizens unhappy with the IRS&#x27;s apparent overreach.

==Construction==

===Site preparations===
As early as 1947, the Bureau of Reclamation had begun investigating two potential sites, both located in the narrow lower reaches of Glen Canyon shortly upstream of Lee&#x27;s Ferry. The site originally favored by the USBR was just upstream, but the final decision was to build the dam upstream because of stronger foundation rock and easier access to gravel deposits on Wahweap Creek. Because the dam site lay in a remote, rugged area of the Colorado Plateau – more than from the closest paved road, U.S. Route 89 – a new road had to be constructed, branching off from US 89 north of Flagstaff, Arizona, and running through the dam site to its terminus at Kanab, Utah. Because of the isolated location, acquiring the land at the dam and reservoir sites was not particularly difficult, but there were a few disputes with ranchers and miners in the area (many of the Navajo Nation). Much of the land acquired for the dam was through an exchange with the Navajo, in which the tribe ceded Manson Mesa south of the dam site for a similar-sized chunk of land near Aneth, Utah, which the Navajo had long coveted.
In the early stages of construction, the only way to cross Glen Canyon was a suspension footbridge made of chicken wire and metal grates. Vehicles had to make a journey in order to get from one side of the canyon to the other. A road link was urgently needed, in order to safely accommodate workers and heavy construction equipment. The contract for building the bridge was awarded to Peter Kiewit Sons and the Judson Pacific Murphy Co. for $4 million and construction began in late 1956, reaching completion on August 11, 1957. When finished, the steel arch Glen Canyon Bridge was itself a marvel of engineering: at long and rising above the river, it was the highest bridge of its kind in the United States and one of the highest in the world. The bridge soon became a major tourist attraction. The March 1959 issue of &quot;LIFE&quot; reported that &quot;motorists [were] driving miles out of their way just to be thrilled by its dizzying height.&quot;

Workers moved to the dam site beginning in the mid-late 1950s; the construction camp started out as a haphazardly organized trailer park that grew with the workforce. During the construction of the Glen Canyon Bridge, the USBR also began planning a company town to house the workers. This resulted in the town of Page, Arizona, named for former Reclamation Commissioner John C. Page. By 1959, Page had a host of temporary buildings, electricity, and a small school serving workers&#x27; children. As the city grew, it gathered additional features, including numerous stores, a hospital, and even a jeweler. It was intended to serve a maximum population of eight thousand, accounting for the workers&#x27; families; the peak workforce would eventually exceed 2,500 in the busiest phases of construction. The engineer in charge of the project would be Lem F. Wylie, who had worked on Hoover Dam and had previously designed six other USBR dams.

Prior to and during construction, three separate grants were issued by the National Park Service to document and recover artifacts of historical cultures along the river. These went to University of Utah historian C. Gregory Crampton and anthropologist Jesse Jennings, and to the Museum of Northern Arizona. Crampton subsequently wrote several books and articles on his findings. The Museum of Northern Arizona funded an expedition by William Miller and Helmut Abt, in coordination with the Navajo Nation, to investigate historical artifacts. They discovered a petroglyph in the upper part of the canyon depicting the appearance of the Crab Nebula in 1054.

In 1956, work began on the two diversion tunnels that would carry the Colorado River around the dam site during construction. Each of the tunnels was in diameter, with a combined capacity of ; the right-side tunnel was long and the left . The right tunnel would be used for carrying the Colorado&#x27;s normal flow around the dam site, while the left tunnel, above the water, would only be used during floods. The lower reaches of the tunnels would later be used to form the lower ends of the dam&#x27;s spillways. About of material would have to be excavated from the diversion tunnels.

On October 15, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower pressed a button on his desk in Washington, D.C., sending a telegraph signal that set off the first blast of dynamite at the portal of the right diversion tunnel. Drilling the tunnels through the porous Navajo sandstone abutting the dam site posed major problems for the excavation crews of the Mountain States Construction Company, which won the contract for the diversion tunnels in 1956. Transporting workers and equipment to the bottom of the canyon was extremely difficult. Initially, transport was done by barge from Wahweap Creek, but the fast current of the Colorado River could be dangerous. After a barge capsized, spilling tons of machinery into the river, a much safer cable-car system was installed. During excavation, the rock frequently broke apart or &quot;slabbed&quot; and collapsed into the tunnels, and metal bolts had to be drilled into the rock to secure it. The largest such event, on August 5, 1958, sent crashing down onto the upper portal of the left diversion tunnel.

Material dug out of the tunnels and the dam abutments on the canyon walls was used to build the two cofferdams to divert the Colorado River, which were complete in February 1960. The upper cofferdam was high, and it alone could store several million acre-feet of water to protect the dam site from flooding in the event that inflows exceeded the capacity of the diversion tunnels. On February 11, 1959, the right diversion tunnel was completed and began to carry the flow of the Colorado. The left tunnel was finished over three months later on May 19, 1959, slightly behind schedule.

===Concrete placement and completion===
With the Colorado River safely diverted around the canyon, construction could begin on the actual concrete arch dam. The contract was given to the Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corporation for an &quot;astoundingly low&quot; $107,955,552, about $30 million less than USBR&#x27;s own estimate. Then, right before construction began, about 750 workers organized a strike because of a wage reduction due to the completion of public facilities at Page. In December 1959, wages were raised by $4 a day, quelling the strikers. Concrete placement started on June 16, 1960, and started at a sluggish but growing pace. In 1962 the workforce topped out at nearly 2,500 employees laboring on the dam. Construction would ultimately claim eighteen lives and injure numerous other workers, but contrary to popular myth, no workers were buried alive in the concrete. Cement needed to make concrete for the dam came from the Phoenix Cement Company plant constructed for the purpose in Clarkdale, south of Flagstaff.
A huge concrete plant capable of putting out 1,450 tons per hour was installed, and a pair of cableways with movable towers (with capacities of 50 and 25 tons respectively) spanned the canyon, carrying the concrete buckets to their final destinations on the steadily rising crest of the dam. The concrete was poured into modular high wooden blocks or &quot;forms&quot;, the largest measuring up to by ; more than 3,000 of these blocks made up the main structure of the dam. Once the concrete cured, the wooden scaffolding was removed and shifted upwards to accommodate the next load of concrete. As more efficient methods of concrete pouring were installed, including conveyors and remotely controlled buckets, the workforce gradually decreased. By late 1962, concrete was being poured into the dam at a rate of per day even as the workforce was scaled down to about 1,500.

At the beginning of 1963, the dam was high enough to begin impounding water; huge steel gates were closed over the right diversion tunnel on January 21, and Lake Powell began to rise. A minimal flow of was allowed through the dam, to prevent the Colorado River from drying up completely. On that day, David Brower confronted President John F. Kennedy in a last-ditch effort to delay Glen Canyon&#x27;s inundation. Brower later said of that exchange: &quot;On January 2, 1963, the last day on which the execution of one of the planet&#x27;s greatest scenic antiquities could yet have been spared, the man who theoretically had the power to save the place did not. I was within a few feet of his desk in Washington that day and witnessed how the forces long at work had their way. So a steel gate dropped, choking off the flow of the canyon&#x27;s carotid artery, and from that moment the canyon&#x27;s life force ebbed quickly. A huge reservoir, absolutely not needed in this century, almost certainly not needed in the next, and conceivably never to be needed at all, began to fill.&quot;

Construction continued and on September 13, 1963, the dam was topped out. Work on the power plant and spillways began directly after the dam wall was complete. The spillway tunnels were excavated around both abutments of the dam, dropping steeply from their control gates on Lake Powell to merge with the lower ends of the diversion tunnels. This measure saved cost, but introduced a weak point where the two tunnels intersected. The upper ends of the diversion tunnels were then sealed with solid concrete. The first electricity was generated on September 4, 1964, with the power sent into the regional electric grid through a pair of long-distance transmission lines as far as Phoenix, Arizona and Farmington, New Mexico. It took two more years to complete all remaining aspects of the project. On September 22, 1966 Lady Bird Johnson gave the official dedication speech for Glen Canyon Dam, before a crowd of 3,000 people.

===Filling Lake Powell===
With a capacity equal to almost two years&#x27; annual flow of the Colorado River, engineers were aware that Lake Powell would be difficult to fill, but more problems were encountered than expected. The original plan was to fill Lake Powell to above sea level, the minimum level necessary to generate hydroelectric power by late 1964, after which water would be released down to Lake Mead, with only the excess stored in Lake Powell. The spring runoff in 1963 was the lowest on record in ten years. By the beginning of 1964, Lake Powell had barely reached half the target level, and Lake Mead had seen a sharp decline. In March, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall ordered the filling halted and extra releases made to Lake Mead, to the consternation of the Upper Basin states. In May, Udall changed his mind yet again to lower releases, gambling that the spring runoff would be enough to raise Powell to minimum power pool by autumn, by which time power releases could begin, to prevent Lake Mead from falling below &quot;its&quot; minimum power pool. That gamble paid off, with Lake Powell barely inching over the mark on August 16, 1964.
It took more than 17 years for Lake Powell to finally reach its full elevation of above sea level, which it crossed on June 22, 1980. One of the main reasons for this slow rise, in addition to the need to meet obligations to the Lower Basin, was the leakage of vast amounts of water into the porous Navajo Sandstone aquifer. Between 1963 and 1969, as much as leaked into the reservoir banks each year. Conversely, some of this &quot;bank storage&quot; flows back into the reservoir as springs and seeps when Lake Powell is low. Exactly how much of this water has potential to return to the reservoir, and how much &quot;disappears&quot; into the ground, is subject to debate.

The Bureau of Reclamation projected that once Lake Powell filled, the total bank storage would stabilize at approximately , and henceforth would fluctuate depending on water levels in the reservoir. The actual loss was , twice the initial prediction, but river flow data indicates that further leakage after 1980 has been negligible. According to a 2013 study by hydrologist Thomas Myers for the Glen Canyon Institute, the reservoir continues to lose about each year due to leakage. According to USBR data for water year 2015 (a year when Lake Powell did not experience a significant overall gain or loss in volume), Lake Powell lost a total of to evaporation and only to leakage.

==Later history==

===The 1983 floods===

During the El Niño winter of 1982–1983, the Bureau of Reclamation predicted an average runoff for the Colorado River basin based on snowpack measurements in the Rocky Mountains. Snowfall during April and May was exceptionally heavy; this combined with a sudden rise in temperatures and unusual rainstorms in June to produce major flooding across the western United States. With Lake Powell nearly full, the USBR did not have enough time to draw down the reservoir to accommodate extra runoff. By mid-June, water was pouring into Lake Powell at over . Even with the power plant and river outlet works running at full capacity, Lake Powell continued to rise to the point where the spillways had to be opened. Other than a brief test in 1980, this was the only time the spillways had ever been used.

At the beginning of June, dam operators opened the gates on the left spillway, sending , less than one-tenth of capacity, down the tunnel into the river below. After a few days, the entire dam suddenly began to shake violently. The spillway was closed down for inspections and workers discovered that the flow of water was causing cavitation—the explosive collapse of vacuum pockets in water moving at high speed—which was damaging the concrete lining and eroding the rock spillway tunnels from the upper ends of the diversion tunnels, which connect to the bottom of the reservoir. This was rapidly being destroyed by the cavitation and it was feared that a connection would be made to the bottom of Lake Powell, compromising the dam&#x27;s foundation and causing the dam to fail.

Meanwhile, snow continued melting in the Rockies and Lake Powell continued to rise rapidly. To delay having to use the spillways, the USBR installed plywood flashboards (later replaced by steel) atop the gates to increase the lake level. Even this additional capacity was exhausted; discharges through the left spillway reached , and the right spillway was opened to . At Lee&#x27;s Ferry, the Colorado River peaked at , which was and still is the highest water flow recorded there since the dam was built. On July 14, Lake Powell reached elevation, a level that has not been exceeded since. Just as it seemed inevitable that the dam would fail, inflows fell and the dam was saved. Upon inspection, it was found that cavitation had caused massive gouging damage to both spillways, carrying away thousands of tons of concrete, steel rebar and huge chunks of rock.

Repairs to the spillways commenced as soon as possible and continued well into 1984. Air slots were installed at the bottom of each spillway to break up and absorb the shock of the bubbles formed by cavitation. In 1984, the Colorado River basin produced even more runoff than 1983, peaking at in early June. This time, the USBR had drawn down the reservoir enough that it absorbed most of the early high flows. Nevertheless, Lake Powell rapidly approached the top of the spillway gates and construction efforts were subsequently focused on the left spillway in order to get it in operation in time. On August 12, the left spillway gates were opened, releasing water at a rate of . The spillway was undamaged, proving the worth of the re-engineering and suggesting that Glen Canyon Dam will also be able to hold against future floods with the magnitude of 1983.

===Continuing debates===
Long after the Glen Canyon Dam was built and continuing to the present day, controversy remains between supporters of dam removal and those who believe it should be left in place. One of the earliest debates regarding the dam was its impact on Rainbow Bridge National Monument, whose high natural arch is the highest in North America, and is a sacred site to the Navajo people. The environmental lobby wanted the Bureau of Reclamation to keep Lake Powell at or below a level of , to prevent it from intruding into the monument. The Bureau of Reclamation proposed to build a barrier dam and pump system in order to keep water out of the monument. With the potential damage that would be caused to the remote environment, &quot;the cure would be far worse than the disease.&quot; The proposal was fought over and litigated for years until it was permanently shelved in 1973.

Glen Canyon Dam became the subject of influential literature, including Edward Abbey&#x27;s novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; (1975), which tells the story of a fictional group of environmentalists fighting against industrial developers in the American Southwest, their ultimate target being Glen Canyon Dam. The novel gained a cult following after its publication and established Glen Canyon Dam as a poster child of environmental destruction caused by dams. Abbey&#x27;s book is discussed in &quot;Ecospeak: Rhetoric and Environmental Politics in America&quot; (1992) by Jimmie Killingsworth and Jacqueline Palmer, who write that Glen Canyon Dam became &quot;the big symbol of all that blocked freedom in the interests of civilized progress.&quot; On March 21, 1981, the radical environmental group Earth First! staged an anti-dam protest by unfurling a tapered black sheet of plastic down the face of the dam, making it appear as if a gigantic crack had appeared in the structure – a direct re-enactment of a scene from Abbey&#x27;s book. Authorities were unable to find the individuals responsible.
In his comprehensive history of western water development, &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot; (1986), Marc Reisner criticized the political forces that resulted in Glen Canyon and hundreds of other dams being built in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of these projects had dubious economic justifications and hidden environmental costs, but the government agencies that built them – namely the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers – were more interested in maintaining their size and influence. Reisner writes that &quot;in the West, it is said, water flows uphill towards money.&quot;

In a 2011 interview, Floyd Dominy, the Reclamation Commissioner who had spearheaded the Colorado River Storage Project, maintained USBR&#x27;s stance on the benefits of the dam project. Although Lake Powell loses water to evaporation and leakage, it continues to serve an important function capturing runoff during wet years, as &quot;insurance&quot; for droughts. During the 2000–2004 Colorado River drought, when the basin experienced its lowest five-year runoff on record, Lake Mead would likely have gone dry and the Lower Basin experienced massive cuts, were it not for releases from Lake Powell.

Lake Powell and Lake Mead are currently operated under an &quot;equalization&quot; policy that governs releases from Glen Canyon Dam. In order to maintain hydropower generation at both Glen Canyon and Hoover Dams, the lakes must be kept at approximately the same level. By spreading out the water, evaporation is greatly increased. Since the year 2000, Lake Mead has steadily declined toward the critical level at which a shortage would be declared for the Lower Basin states. A plan called &quot;Fill Mead First&quot;, which would drain Lake Powell in order to refill Lake Mead, has gained traction in recent years. Glen Canyon Dam would remain in place (as total removal of the structure would be prohibitively expensive), but would only store water in wet seasons when runoff exceeds the capacity of Lake Mead to hold it.

Much of the opposition to this plan is along political lines: Lake Powell is legally considered the Upper Basin&#x27;s water, and Lake Mead belongs to the Lower Basin. The Friends of Lake Powell have called this an attempt to steal water from the Upper Basin, to avoid a shortage in the Lower Basin. The Upper Basin has released 107% of its obligation from Lake Powell since 2000; therefore, falling levels in Lake Mead are a result of water overuse and waste in the Lower Basin states – a &quot;structural deficit&quot;. There are also arguments for storing water in Powell: Lake Mead, with its much lower elevation and hotter climate, has a considerably greater evaporation rate than Lake Powell. In addition, a 1983 study by Larry J. Paulson of the University of Nevada showed that the cold water discharge from Glen Canyon Dam has led to a significant reduction of the water temperature, and thus evaporation, from Lake Mead.

==Design==

===Dam and spillways===

Glen Canyon&#x27;s overall design was based on that of Hoover Dam – a massive concrete arch-gravity structure anchored in solid bedrock – with several significant changes. The engineers wanted the dam to rely predominantly on its arch shape to carry the tremendous pressure of the impounded water into the canyon walls instead of depending on the sheer weight of the structure to hold the reservoir back, as had been done at Hoover. The foundation rock at Glen Canyon consists of porous sandstone prone to spalling, in contrast to the stronger granite at the Hoover Dam site, forcing the Glen Canyon design to follow more conservative lines by greatly thickening the abutments, thus increasing the surface area through which the weight of dam and reservoir would be transmitted to the rock and relieving the pressure on the highly breakable cliffs.

The Glen Canyon Dam is high from the foundations and stands above the Colorado River. The crest of the dam is long and wide, while the maximum thickness of the base is . The elevation at the crest is , and the elevation of the Colorado River below the dam is . In total, the dam contains of concrete and of reinforcing steel. The hydroelectric power station and river outlet works are located at the foot of the dam. The outlet works consist of four diameter pipes, each controlled by a ring gate and hollow-jet valve. The discharge capacity of the river outlet works is .

The two spillway tunnels are excavated through the canyon walls on each side of the dam. Twin radial gates, each wide and high, control the flow of water into the spillways. Together, the spillways can pass up to . The tunnels required of excavation and another of concrete lining. The circular, concrete-lined spillway tunnels plunge at a 55-degree angle, reducing in diameter from , until they intersect with the old river diversion tunnels at sharp elbow joints before returning to the Colorado River. This was done as a cost-saving measure, but resulted in the destruction of both spillways during the 1983 flood releases. The repairs, in which air slots were installed to prevent cavitation shock waves, cost about $15 million.

===Water storage and distribution===
With a capacity of , Lake Powell is the second largest man-made lake in the United States by total water capacity (after only Lake Mead), extending upstream through the canyons of Arizona and Utah. The lake covers at its full pool elevation of . The active, or useful capacity is . The minimum water level required for power generation is , corresponding to storage of , and the &quot;dead pool&quot;, the lowest point at which water can be released through the dam, is with storage of . When Glen Canyon Dam was first built, the reservoir capacity was estimated at , but some of this has since been lost to siltation. Because of the hundreds of bays and sinuous side canyons, including those formed by the San Juan, Escalante and Dirty Devil Rivers, Lake Powell has an exceptionally long shoreline for a lake of its size – about at full pool, longer than the entire west coast of the continental United States.
Glen Canyon Dam&#x27;s most vital purpose is to provide storage to ensure enough water flows from the Upper Colorado River Basin to the lower, especially in drought years. The 1922 Colorado River Compact requires annual delivery of to the Lower Basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada; the 1944 treaty with Mexico obligates the U.S. to allow at least for use in the Mexican states of Baja California and Sonora. Glen Canyon Dam must supply at least of this water; the remaining comes from other tributaries of the Colorado River. The required release from Glen Canyon is averaged over a 10-year period, so releases in each year may be higher or lower depending on the amount of runoff. In wetter years, the Bureau of Reclamation may decide to release extra water from Glen Canyon Dam if the level of Lake Powell exceeds the &quot;equalization tier&quot;, an elevation determined by the difference in storage between Lake Powell and Lake Mead.

Most of Lake Powell&#x27;s inflow originates as summer snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. Releases are made over a water year of October 1–September 30, since the annual snowpack begins to accumulate in late autumn. On April 1 of each year, the Bureau of Reclamation releases its official forecast of the April–July (snowmelt season) runoff, and adjusts releases from Glen Canyon Dam accordingly to maintain Lake Powell at a safe level. An accurate forecast is vital to prevent uncontrolled spilling, which would waste water that could have been used for power generation. Although the snowpack typically reaches its peak and begins to melt in April, the picture can occasionally change unexpectedly and dramatically – either due to a hot and dry spring that evaporates snow before it can melt, or an extremely wet spring as occurred in May 1983. After the near disaster in 1983, the USBR has maintained a minimum of of flood-storage space in Lake Powell at the beginning of each year, to guard against unanticipated high runoff.

===21st century drought===
Colorado River flows have been below average since 2000 as a result of the southwestern North American megadrought, leading to lower lake levels. In winter 2005 (before the spring run-off) the lake reached its then-lowest level since filling, an elevation of above sea level, which was approximately below full pool. After 2005, the lake level slowly rebounded, although it has not filled completely since then. Summer 2011 saw the third largest June and the second largest July runoff since the closure of Glen Canyon Dam, and the water level peaked at nearly , 77 percent of capacity, on July 30. Water years 2012 and 2013 were, respectively, the third and fourth-lowest runoff years recorded on the Colorado River. By April 9, 2014, the lake level had fallen to , largely erasing the gains made in 2011.

Colorado River levels returned to normal during water years 2014 and 2015 (pushing the lake to by the end of water year 2015. The Bureau of Reclamation in 2014 reduced the Lake Powell release from 8.23 to 7.48 million acre-feet, for the first time since the lake filled in 1980. This was done due to the &quot;equalization&quot; guideline which stipulates that an approximately equal amount of water must be retained in both Lake Powell and Lake Mead, in order to preserve hydro-power generation capacity at both lakes. This resulted in Lake Mead declining to the lowest level on record since the 1930s.

Long-term water level decline continued, forcing an emergency release of water from the Flaming Gorge Reservoir in July 2021, and by April 22, 2022 Lake Powell was at in elevation – just of capacity. This marks the lowest water level for Lake Powell since it was filled in 1963. Peer-reviewed studies indicate that storing water in Lake Mead rather than in Lake Powell would yield a savings of 300,000 acre feet of water or more per year, leading to calls by environmentalists to drain Lake Powell and restore Glen Canyon to its natural, free-flowing state.

===Power generation===
The other principal goal of Glen Canyon Dam is hydroelectricity generation. It is the second-biggest producer of hydroelectric power in the Southwestern United States, after Hoover Dam. Revenues derived from power sales were integral in paying off the bonds used to build the dam and have also been used to fund other Bureau of Reclamation projects, including environmental restoration programs in the Grand Canyon and elsewhere along the Colorado River. For this reason, it has long been known as a &quot;cash register&quot; dam. The dam also serves as a primary peaking power plant and black start power source for the Southwest electrical grid. The power plant has a total capacity of 1,320 megawatts from eight 165,000 kilowatt generators. Each generator is driven by a 254,000 horsepower vertical-axis Francis turbine. The gross hydraulic head is . The units were installed between September 1964 and February 1966 at an original rating of 950 megawatts; an upgrade project between 1985 and 1997 brought it to its present capacity.

Because of fluctuating demands on the electrical grid, the dam release into the Colorado River rises and falls dramatically on a daily basis. After the dam was completed in 1964, there were few restrictions on hydro-power generation. The minimum dam release was set at a meager (increased to during the summer whitewater rafting season), with a maximum of during peak times; to respond to changing power demands, river flows could double or even triple in the space of an hour. This caused severe erosion of the Colorado River banks downstream, damaging habitat for native fish and causing danger for boaters, who could get stuck whenever the river flow dropped too quickly. In 1990 temporary restrictions were put in place on dam operations, before the release of a final environmental impact statement (EIS).

The EIS completed March 21, 1995 cemented some restrictions on dam operations, limiting the maximum power release to , the maximum hourly &quot;ramp-up&quot; (increase in river flow) to , and the maximum &quot;ramp-down&quot; to . The minimum dam release was set to during the day and at night. Flood control releases are allowed to go higher, but must remain constant for the entire month. Because these criteria limit the flexibility of Glen Canyon Dam to meet grid demands, economic losses for the period 1997–2005 were estimated at $38 million to $58 million per year.

Between 1980 and 2013, Glen Canyon Dam generated an average of 4,717 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year, enough for about 400,000 homes. The highest was 8,703 GWh in 1984, and the lowest was 3,299 GWh in 2005. Power generation is affected not only by the volume of water passing through the dam, but also the depth of water in the reservoir, as a higher water level means more pressure (head) on the turbines. Hydropower generated at Glen Canyon serves about 5 million people in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, and is sold to utilities in these states as 20-year contracts. Power sales have been managed by the Western Area Power Administration since 1977. Glen Canyon Dam generates enough power to offset 6.7 billion pounds (3 billion kg) of carbon dioxide emissions each year. Drought conditions in the 21st century have reduced the amount of hydropower available from Glen Canyon Dam.

An unusual feature of the Glen Canyon power plant is the Kentucky bluegrass lawn occupying the crescent between the dam and hydroelectric plant. At the time of construction in 1964, the steel penstocks feeding water to the power plant were exposed and they experienced severe vibration when in use. Engineers decided to bury them in soil to act as a buffer against the potentially damaging vibrations. The grass was later planted to prevent the dirt from getting blown away – but also provides a mild cooling effect through evapotranspiration, reducing temperatures inside the power plant.

==Environmental issues==

Because of its tremendous ecological effect on the Colorado River, the Glen Canyon Dam has been subject to decades of criticism from the environmental movement. Being located in a high desert climate amid porous geology, Lake Powell causes huge evaporation and seepage losses. The Glen Canyon Institute estimates that is lost from the reservoir in an average year. This amounts to 6 percent of the Colorado River&#x27;s flow, an increasingly valuable amount of water in an arid land for both humans and the animals and plants that live along the river. (This amount greatly decreases when Lake Powell is low; with the reservoir about half full in water year 2015, evaporation was .)

Like all dams, Glen Canyon traps sediment (silt), but because the Colorado is an especially muddy river, the dam has posed even more visible consequences for the river within the Grand Canyon. About 100 million US tons (90,700,000 metric tons) of sediment are trapped behind the dam annually, equal to about 30,000 dump truck loads per day. Because of the dam, sediment deposited by the Colorado and its tributaries is slowly filling up the canyon, and projections put the useful life of the reservoir at 300 to 700 years. If no action is taken such as dredging or sediment sluicing, in a few hundred years, sediment deposits will begin to build up at the foot of the dam and will gradually block the different outlets, reducing the dam&#x27;s capacity to store and release water. Thus, it would become more difficult to maintain the required release of below the dam. The Colorado River would reduce to a trickle in dry seasons as it naturally did before the dam was built, potentially compromising the water supply of the Lower Basin states.

The Colorado through Grand Canyon now lacks the source of sediment it needs to build sandbars and islands, and these natural fluvial formations within the canyon have now suffered severe damage from erosion. The floods that once scoured the river each year are now contained behind the dam except in extraordinary cases such as 1983–84; the lack of floods has promoted vegetation encroachment which not only has considerably changed the riparian zone environment but has created problems for tourism, as hikers and boaters often cannot find good spots to camp due to overgrowth. Flood control has also caused an inability of the river to carry away the rockslides that are common along the canyons, leading to the creation of incrementally dangerous rapids that pose a hazard to fish and boaters alike. Before damming, the Colorado commonly reached flows of more than during the spring; this has been limited to less than most years with few exceptions.
Before the dam was built, Colorado River temperatures ranged from over in the heat of summer to just above freezing in winter. Today, water released by Glen Canyon is a consistent throughout the year due to a thermal mass effect in Lake Powell. The water typically released from hundreds of feet below the lake surface through the penstocks is insulated from temperature fluctuations by the thick layer of water above it. Nikolai Ramsey of the Grand Canyon Trust describes the clearer, colder river as a &quot;death zone for native fish&quot;, such as the endemic Colorado pikeminnow and humpback chub, which are adapted to survive in warm, silty water.

According to biologist and river guide Michael P. Ghiglieri, many drowning deaths by boaters in the Grand Canyon have been caused or exacerbated by rapid hypothermia and hypothermic shock caused by entering the cold water. He further described that during the record post-dam high-flow season of 1983 (mentioned above), there was only one boating fatality in the canyon, providing a strong challenge to views that the dam, by reducing and mediating river flows, increases the safety of canyon river users. The river water temperature in 1983 was significantly higher than normal, due to a large portion of the water having come from overflows of warmer surface water over the spillways of Glen Canyon Dam, rather than the colder lower levels which feed the penstocks.

Glen Canyon Dam has also impacted the Colorado River well downstream of the Grand Canyon. When the gates of the dam were closed in 1963, the resulting reductions in river flow effectively dried up the Colorado River Delta, the large estuary formed by the Colorado River at the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) in Mexico. Prior to the completion of Glen Canyon Dam, about reached the delta each year, despite heavy water use in California and Arizona. Because Glen Canyon Dam made possible an increased utilization of water from the Colorado River system, not enough water is left to flow to the delta in a normal year, and about of ecologically productive wetlands have disappeared. In 2014 an intentional &quot;pulse flow&quot; was released into the delta to restore some of these wetlands; the viability of such flows have been controversial, considering the already high demand for Colorado River water.

==Restoration efforts==

On March 26, 1996, the penstocks and two of the outlet works&#x27; bypass tubes at Glen Canyon Dam were opened to maximum capacity, causing a flood of to move down the Colorado River. This was the first of the Glen Canyon Adaptive Management Program &quot;high flow experiments&quot;, a controlled effort to assist the recovery of the damaged riverine ecosystem by mimicking the floods that once swept through the canyons each spring. The flow appeared to have scoured clean numerous pockets of encroaching vegetation, carried away rockslides that had become dangerous to boaters, and rearranged sand and gravel bars along the river, and was initially believed to be an environmental success. However, in the following months it was discovered that the initial results were misleading.

Crews working in the Grand Canyon after the 1996 experiment found that the offensive vegetation had not been carried away as previously thought – only buried – and had mostly recovered within six months. The surface area of sandbars had been increased, but much of the material had been eroded from the submerged portions of the bars and deposited on top, making them unstable, rather than scoured from the riverbed as hoped. Subsequent releases in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2014 were timed to take advantage of summer monsoon storms, and redistribute sediment carried into the Grand Canyon by the Paria and Little Colorado Rivers. The high-flow experiments do not change the total amount of water outflow from Lake Powell on an annual basis, but as a consequence hydro-electric power releases during the rest of the year must be reduced. Some organizations, such as Living Rivers, continue to believe that the dam has too large and severe of an effect on the river&#x27;s ecology to make restoration efforts worthwhile.

==Recreation==
According to the U.S. National Park Service, Lake Powell is &quot;widely recognized by boating enthusiasts as one of the premier water-based recreation destinations in the world.&quot; Despite its remote location, the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which surrounds the reservoir, receives more than three million visitors annually. Activities include boating, fishing, waterskiing, jet-skiing, swimming and hiking. Prepared campgrounds can be found at each marina, but many visitors choose to rent a houseboat or bring their own camping equipment, find a private spot somewhere in the canyons, and make their own camp (there are no restrictions on where visitors can stay). About 85,000 people per year travel via boat to Rainbow Bridge in Utah, a large natural arch once very hard to access, but now easily reachable because one of the arms of the reservoir extends near it.

Because most of the lake is surrounded by steep sandstone walls, access is limited to developed marinas. The heavily used Wahweap and Antelope Point Marinas are located in Arizona, close to Page. Two other marinas at Halls Crossing and Bullfrog are located further upstream in Utah. The Hite Marina, located at the upper end of the reservoir near the Hite Crossing Bridge, is now disused since the water level is usually too low for boats to launch there. Other facilities at Dangling Rope and Rainbow Bridge are accessible only by boat. Aside from the bridges at either end of the lake, a car-and-passenger ferry between Halls Crossing and Bullfrog is the only way for vehicles to cross Lake Powell.

More than 500,000 people tour the Carl Hayden Visitor Center at Glen Canyon Dam each year. The Bureau of Reclamation provides guided tours of the dam; stringent security measures have been in place since the September 11 attacks. The base of the dam can also be reached via boat from Lee&#x27;s Ferry. Because of the cold, clear water released from Lake Powell, the stretch of the Colorado River between Glen Canyon Dam and Lee&#x27;s Ferry has become an excellent rainbow trout fishery. Trout are not native to the Colorado River system; they were stocked in the river below Glen Canyon Dam after the dam was built. Other non-native fish such as smallmouth bass, striped bass, largemouth bass and black crappie were planted in Lake Powell to provide sport fishing opportunities.
Like many U.S. lakes and reservoirs, Lake Powell has an active problem with zebra and quagga mussels, invasive bivalve species originating in eastern Europe. Mussels are most commonly transferred from lake to lake attached to the hulls, and inside the bilge area of boats. Lake users are required by law to clean, drain and dry their vessels, both before and after taking a trip to Lake Powell. Mussel infestations tend to clog the hydroelectric intakes at the Glen Canyon Dam, as well as the propellers and exhaust pipes of boats, requiring expensive de-contamination. Their impact on the lake ecology appears to be low, or even beneficial due to their providing a food source for fish.

<text>Nancy Catherine Greene Raine (born May 11, 1943) is a former Canadian Senator for British Columbia and an Olympic alpine champion voted as Canada&#x27;s Female Athlete of the 20th Century. She was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Greene Raine won the giant slalom in the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France.

After being appointed to the Senate in 2009, Greene Raine retired on May 11, 2018, when she reached the mandatory retirement age of 75.

She is the mother of retired alpine skier Willy Raine.

==Biography==
Greene was born on May 11, 1943, in Ottawa, Ontario. She moved with her family to Rossland, British Columbia, before she was three years of age. Rossland is a mountainous area and the site of the first ski competition ever held in Canada in 1897. Greene began schussing at a young age and while in high school she competed in the Canadian Junior Championships. She would go on to win 14 World Cup victories by 1968.

===Career===

Nicknamed &quot;Tiger&quot; because of her &quot;go for it&quot; attitude and her aggressive style of skiing, she won 17 Canadian ski championship titles and the United States championship three times. In 1967, Greene broke the European domination of the sport, winning the inaugural World Cup. That year she won seven of 16 events, taking the over-all title with four giant slalom victories plus two in slalom and one in downhill. Her accomplishment earned her Canadian &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot; honours.

In 1968 she won the World Cup title again plus, at that year&#x27;s Winter Olympic Games in Grenoble, France, she captured a gold medal in the giant slalom, by one of the largest margins in Olympic history, and a silver medal in the slalom. For the second time, she was named Canada&#x27;s &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot;.

Following her retirement from competition, she made a major contribution to Canadian sport by accepting an appointment to the federal government&#x27;s &quot;Task Force on Sport For Canadians&quot;. During this period Greene also did promotional work for various companies including Rossignol, Pontiac, and Mars Inc. In a 1970s television commercial for the latter product, she was seen to discard the wrapper onto a ski slope in the course of consuming the product. This minor act, coming at a time of nascent environmental sentiment, appears to have entered the public memory as references to it have dogged her over the years.

Married with twin boys and having built a cabin in Whistler in 1970, Greene and her husband Al Raine were instrumental in the early development of the Whistler-Blackcomb Resort in Whistler, British Columbia, and then later in the development and promotion of skiing at Sun Peaks Resort, just north of Kamloops. The expansion of the resort was not without controversy as some Native groups opposed the move, and protesters occupying the new site were removed by arrest under a provincial injunction.

Greene is the skiing ambassador at Sun Peaks Resort. She and her husband built Nancy Greene&#x27;s Cahilty Lodge, where they make their home. Dedicated to the promotion of her sport for more than 30 years, the Nancy Greene Ski League has been an important entry-level race program for young children.

Over the years, Greene has been the recipient of numerous awards including her country&#x27;s highest civilian honour, the Order of Canada. She has been honoured with the naming of &quot;Nancy Greene Provincial Park&quot; and &quot;Nancy Greene Lake&quot; in the Monashee Mountains of British Columbia&#x27;s Kootenay region. A stretch of Capilano Road in North Vancouver was renamed Nancy Greene Way. In 1999, her name was engraved in Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame and she was voted Canada&#x27;s female athlete of the century in a survey of newspaper editors and broadcasters conducted by The Canadian Press and Broadcast News.

In 1990, Greene and husband Al Raine were encouraged by the BC provincial government to pursue the development of a new ski resort in the Melvin Creek Valley, between Mount Currie and Lillooet, both predominantly Native communities. Perhaps coincidentally, the rough road accessing the area was paved and upgraded at this time by the government as an extension to highway 99, the main road from Vancouver to Pemberton. Despite opposition from Native groups, backcountry recreationists, biologists, and environmental organizations, the project received approval from BC&#x27;s Environmental Assessment Office in 2000, but has been stalled in a series of protests and blockades since.

In 1993, Greene announced her support for the right-wing Reform Party of Canada.

In April 2005, Greene was named chancellor of Thompson Rivers University.

In 2006, Greene-Raine contributed a small part of one of her Olympic competition skis to the Six String Nation project. Part of that material now serves as the second reinforcing strip on the interior of &quot; Voyageur&quot;, the guitar at the heart of the project.

On January 2, 2009, Greene took her seat as a Conservative member of the Senate of Canada. After her 75th birthday, Greene retired as a senator.

She was named Olympic Ambassador for the 2010 Vancouver games. On February 12, 2010, Greene lit the Vancouver Olympic cauldron along with fellow Canadian sports icons Steve Nash, Rick Hansen, Catriona Le May Doan, and Wayne Gretzky.

<text>The Charlemagne Prize (; full name originally &quot;Internationaler Karlspreis der Stadt Aachen&quot;, International Charlemagne Prize of the City of Aachen, since 1988 &quot;Internationaler Karlspreis zu Aachen&quot;, International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen) is a prize awarded for work done in the service of European unification. It has been awarded since 1950 by the German city of Aachen. It commemorates Charlemagne (), ruler of the Frankish Empire and founder of what became the Holy Roman Empire, who was the first to unify Western Europe following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire. Traditionally the award is given to the recipient on Ascension Day in a ceremony in the Aachen Town Hall. In April 2008, the organisers of the Charlemagne Prize and the European Parliament jointly created a new European Charlemagne Youth Prize, which recognises contributions by young people towards the process of European integration. Patrons of the foundation are King Philippe of Belgium, King Felipe VI of Spain, and Henri, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.

== History ==

On 19 December 1949, presented to the reading group &quot;Corona Legentium Aquensis&quot;, which he had founded, his proposals for the prize: &quot;We have the honour of proposing annual presentation of an international prize for the most valuable contribution in the services of Western European understanding and work for the community, and in the services of humanity and world peace. This contribution may be in the field of literary, scientific, economic or political endeavour.&quot;

The sponsors of the prize, the city of Aachen, refer to Charlemagne as the &quot;Founder of Western Culture&quot;, and assert that under his reign, the city of Aachen was once the spiritual and political centre of the whole of what is now western Europe.

The first Charlemagne Prize was awarded to Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, the founder of the Pan-European Movement.

Following the presentation of the award to the Italian Prime Minister Alcide de Gasperi in 1952, the International Charlemagne Prize of the City of Aachen has repeatedly sent messages going far beyond Germany and promoting the &quot;unity of Europe&quot;.

The award sponsors assert that the list of Charlemagne Prize winners reflects the history of the European process of unification, commonly referred to as European integration. They continue that it has been awarded to founding fathers of a United Europe such as de Gasperi, Schuman, Monnet and Adenauer, and to those who have embodied hope for integration such as Edward Heath, Konstantinos Karamanlis, and His Majesty Juan Carlos I.

The sponsors promote that the Charlemagne Prize is not only an expression of gratitude for lasting services for the unity of Europe, but also an encouragement and an expression of hopes and expectations directed towards the future. They quote Kurt Pfeiffer: &quot;the Charlemagne Prize reaches into the future, and at the same time it embodies an obligation – an obligation of the highest ethical value. It is directed at a voluntary union of the European peoples without constraint, so that in their newfound strength they may defend the highest earthly goods – freedom, humanity and peace – and safeguard the future of their children and children&#x27;s children.&quot;

In April 2008, the organisers of the Charlemagne Prize and the European Parliament jointly created a new European Charlemagne Youth Prize, which recognises contributions by young people towards the process of European integration.

<doc id="344833" wikidata="Q2136755" url="?curid=344833" title="On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)">
<text>On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service is the tenth novel and eleventh book in Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;James Bond&quot; series. It was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 1 April 1963. Fleming changed the formula and structure from the previous novel, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, and made a determined effort to produce a work that adhered to his tried and tested format. The initial and secondary print runs sold out quickly, with over 60,000 copies sold in the first month, double that of the previous book&#x27;s first month of sales. Fleming wrote the novel at Goldeneye, his holiday home in Jamaica, while &quot;Dr. No&quot;, the first entry in the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series by Eon Productions, was being filmed nearby.

&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; is the second book in what is known as the &quot;Blofeld trilogy&quot;, which begins with &quot;Thunderball&quot; and concludes with &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. This episode centres on Bond&#x27;s ongoing search to find Ernst Stavro Blofeld after the Thunderball incident. Bond finds Blofeld in Switzerland and attacks the centre where he is based, although Blofeld escapes in the confusion. Bond meets and falls in love with Contessa Teresa &quot;Tracy&quot; di Vicenzo during the story. The pair marry at the end of the novel, but hours after the ceremony, Blofeld and his partner, Irma Bunt, attack the couple and Tracy is killed. Fleming developed Bond&#x27;s character within the book, showing an emotional side that was not present in the previous stories.

As he had done in previous novels, Fleming used his past experiences and details of people he met during his work to provide details in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. The novel is one of three Bond stories to deal with the disruption of markets and the economy, in this case Blofeld&#x27;s planned disruption to the food supply by bioterrorism. The theme of food and drink is referred to throughout the novel, with Bond&#x27;s meals and drinks being described in detail.

&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; received broadly positive reviews in the British and American press with some reviewers pleased at the return to the more traditional form of Bond storyline. The novel was adapted as a three-part story in &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1963, serialised in eleven parts in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and then developed as a daily cartoon strip in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in 1964–1965. In 1969 the novel was adapted as the sixth film in the Eon Productions &quot;James Bond&quot; film series; this was the only film to star George Lazenby as Bond.

==Plot==
For more than a year, the Secret Service agent James Bond has been involved in &quot;Operation Bedlam&quot;: tracking down the criminal organisation SPECTRE and its leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, after they had hijacked two nuclear devices in an attempt to blackmail the Western world. Convinced SPECTRE no longer exists, Bond is frustrated by his service&#x27;s insistence that he continue the search and by his inability to find Blofeld. He mentally composes a letter of resignation for his superior, M.

While driving across northern France to Britain, Bond encounters a beautiful young woman named Contessa Teresa &quot;Tracy&quot; di Vicenzo. He subsequently meets her at a gaming table, where he saves her from dishonour by paying the gambling debt she is unable to cover. The next day Bond follows her and interrupts her attempted suicide, but they are captured by professional henchmen. They are taken to the offices of Marc-Ange Draco, head of the Unione Corse, the biggest European crime syndicate. Tracy is the only child of Draco, who believes the only way to save his daughter from further suicide attempts is for Bond to marry her. To facilitate this, he offers Bond a dowry of £1 million; Bond refuses the offer but agrees to keep in contact with Tracy after she has medical assistance.

At Bond&#x27;s request, Draco uses his contacts to establish that Blofeld is somewhere in Switzerland. Bond returns to England to be given another lead: the College of Arms in London has discovered that Blofeld has assumed the title and name of Comte Balthazar de Bleuville and, wanting formal confirmation of the title, has asked the College to declare him a count.

On the pretext that an inherited minor physical abnormality (a lack of earlobes) needs a personal confirmation, Bond impersonates a College of Arms representative, Sir Hilary Bray, to visit Blofeld&#x27;s lair atop Piz Gloria, a fictional mountain in the Swiss Alps. He finally meets Blofeld, who has lost weight and undergone plastic surgery, partly to remove his earlobes, but also to disguise himself from the police and security services who are tracking him down.

Bond learns that Blofeld has apparently been curing a group of young British and Irish women of their allergies to food and livestock. In truth, Blofeld and his aide, Irma Bunt, have been brainwashing them into carrying biological warfare agents back to Britain and Ireland to destroy the agricultural economy, upon which post–Second World War Britain depends. Believing himself discovered, Bond escapes by ski from Piz Gloria, chased by SPECTRE operatives, some of whom he kills in the process; Blofeld sets off an avalanche, which narrowly misses Bond. Afterward, in a state of total exhaustion, he encounters Tracy. She is in the town at the base of the mountain after being told by her father that Bond may be in the vicinity. Bond is too weak to take on Blofeld&#x27;s henchmen alone and she helps him escape to the airport. Smitten by the resourceful, headstrong woman, he proposes marriage and she accepts. Bond then returns to England and works on the plan to capture Blofeld and thwart his plot.

Helped by Draco&#x27;s Unione Corse, Bond mounts an air assault against the clinic and Blofeld. The clinic is destroyed, but Blofeld makes off down a bobsled run and—pursued by Bond—he escapes. Bond flies to Germany where he marries Tracy. The two of them drive off on their honeymoon but, a few hours later, Blofeld and Bunt attack the car and Tracy is killed.

==Background and writing history==
By January 1962 the author Ian Fleming had published nine books in the preceding nine years: eight novels and a collection of short stories. A tenth book, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, was being edited and prepared for production; it was released at the end of March 1962. Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica in January 1962 to write &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot; magazine: &quot;I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour&#x27;s work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.&quot; For &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; he &quot;took as much trouble as ever with the plot&quot;, according to his biographer, John Pearson.
Fleming experimented with his format in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, writing the story in the first-person narrative of a Canadian woman whom Bond rescues from rape at the hands of two thugs. He reverted to his usual formula for &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. He had undertaken some research in Britain before he left for Jamaica, and he contacted the Writers and Speakers Research Agency to ask about &quot;which parts of the United Kingdom would be the best targets for which bacteria, etc&quot;, and to find someone who could speak Corsican and provide information about the Unione Corse. &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; was written in January and February 1962, while the first Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot;, was being filmed nearby; Fleming visited the film set several times and met the cast, even inviting them to dine at Goldeneye with one of his friends and neighbours, Noël Coward. Fleming was attracted to the film&#x27;s female lead, Ursula Andress, and included a mention of her in the novel he was writing.

The first draft of the novel was 196 pages long and called &quot;The Belles of Hell&quot;. Fleming later changed the title after being told of a nineteenth-century sailing novel called &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, seen by his friend Nicholas Henderson in Portobello Road Market. Fleming thought his draft was the best book he had yet written. Sections were later added in England after he undertook further research on heraldry and biological warfare. Robin de La Lanne-Mirrlees of the College of Arms assisted Fleming with the background and also designed a coat of arms for Bond.

&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; is the second book in &quot;the Blofeld trilogy&quot;, sitting between &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1961), where SPECTRE is introduced, and &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1964), where Bond finally kills Blofeld. Although Blofeld is present in &quot;Thunderball&quot;, he directs operations from a distance and so he and Bond never meet. &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; constitutes his and Bond&#x27;s first meeting. Although Fleming did not date the events within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have identified timelines based on episodes and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put the events of &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; in 1961; Griswold is more precise and considers the story to have taken place between September 1961 and 1 January 1962.

Although he was often a formulaic writer, with the death of Bond&#x27;s new wife at the end of the novel Fleming showed he was prepared to break the formula of a popular writer by avoiding a happy ending, according to the writer John Atkins. The communications academic Jerry Palmer believes Fleming was adopting a different convention of a thriller: that the hero should be alone. Palmer states that conventions determined Tracy needed to die, adding &quot;James Bond happily married is a contradiction in terms&quot;.

==Development==
===Inspirations===

As with all his Bond books, Fleming used events or names from his life in his writing. In the 1930s Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski; he once deliberately set off down a slope that had been closed because of the danger of an avalanche. The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down, catching him at its end: Fleming used the incident as the model for Bond&#x27;s escape from Piz Gloria. Fleming would occasionally stay at the sports club of Schloss Mittersill in the Austrian Alps; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club and turned it into an institute for research into so-called &quot;race science&quot;. It was this pseudo-scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld&#x27;s own centre of Piz Gloria.
The connection between M and the inspiration for his character, Rear Admiral John Godfrey, was made apparent with Bond visiting Quarterdeck, M&#x27;s home. There, Bond rings the ship&#x27;s bell for HMS &quot;Repulse&quot;, M&#x27;s last command: it was Godfrey&#x27;s ship too. Godfrey was Fleming&#x27;s superior officer in the Naval Intelligence Division (NID) during the war and was known for his bellicose and irascible temperament. Fleming also used the name of Donald McLachlan, a former colleague of both his and Godfrey&#x27;s in the NID.

The name &quot;Hilary Bray&quot; was that of an old Etonian with whom Fleming worked at the stockbroking firm Rowe &amp; Pitman. &quot;Sable Basilisk&quot; was based on the title of &quot;Rouge Dragon&quot; in the College of Arms. Rouge Dragon was Lanne-Mirrlees&#x27;s title at the college; he asked Fleming not to use his real title in the book, although it did appear in the manuscript and typescripts. In a play on words, Fleming used Lanne-Mirrlees&#x27;s address, a flat in Basil Street, and combined it with a dragon-like creature, a basilisk, to come up with the name. Lanne-Mirrlees&#x27;s ancestors were generally born without earlobes, and Fleming used this physical attribute for Blofeld. During his research, Lanne-Mirrlees also discovered that the line of the Bonds of Peckham bears the family motto &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot;, which Fleming appropriated for Bond&#x27;s own family.

Fleming also used historical references for some of his names. Marc-Ange Draco&#x27;s name is based upon that of &quot;El Draco&quot;, the Spanish nickname for Sir Francis Drake. For Tracy&#x27;s background, Fleming used that of Muriel Wright, a married wartime lover of his who died in an air-raid. Bond&#x27;s grief for the loss of his wife echoes Fleming&#x27;s at the loss of Wright. Fleming made some mistakes in the novel, such as Bond ordering a half-bottle of Pol Roger champagne; Fleming&#x27;s friend Patrick Leigh Fermor pointed out that Pol Roger was the only champagne at the time not to be produced in half-bottles.

===Characters===
&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; contains what the writer Raymond Benson—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—calls &quot;major revelations&quot; about Bond&#x27;s character and habits. These start with Bond&#x27;s showing an emotional side, visiting the grave of his former lover Vesper Lynd; it is revealed that he has been doing this every year since her death. This emotional side is again shown with Bond asking Tracy to marry him. The author Val McDermid considers that both professionally and personally, Bond is a more emotionally rounded character than in previous novels in the series. Disillusioned with his job at the start of the novel he progresses through the plot to the point where, for McDermid, &quot;his reactions are complex, far more three-dimensional than the films&quot;. In 1963 the critic Raymond Mortimer described Bond as having &quot;values [that] are both anti-humanist and anti-Christian&quot;. Bond is the greedy and predatory id to M&#x27;s &quot;pleasure-hating and grumpy&quot; superego. Mortimer went on to say that &quot;James Bond is what every man would like to be, and what every woman would like between her sheets&quot;. The novelist and critic Kingsley Amis—in his examination of Bond—finds Bond a Byronic hero, seen as &quot;lonely, melancholy, of fine natural physique which has become in some way ravaged, of similarly fine but ravaged countenance, dark and brooding in expression, of a cold or cynical veneer, above all enigmatic, in possession of a sinister secret&quot;.

Amis observes that Bond&#x27;s character changes during the course of the novels, physically and emotionally declining through the series; he notes that &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; sees Bond&#x27;s sharpest decline because of the death of Tracy, leading him to be in a form of neurosis at the start of the next book, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett agree, and note that the darkness in Bond becomes more pronounced with the murder of his wife. Bond drinks far more alcohol in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; than he does in previous books, and this reflected Fleming&#x27;s alcohol intake in the early 1960s. Near the beginning of the novel, one work-day evening, Bond has four double vodkas and tonics and some seconal, a barbiturate; at other points Bond &quot;was aching for a drink&quot; and his urine &quot;showed traces of an excess of uric acid ... due to a super-abundance of alcohol in the blood-stream&quot;. One study, undertaken by doctors, estimated Bond&#x27;s alcohol intake at between 65 and 92 units of alcohol a week, which puts him at the level of &quot;over four times the advisable maximum alcohol consumption for an adult male&quot;, based on the UK&#x27;s medical recommendations.

Benson considers that the character of Tracy is not as well defined as some other female leads in the Bond canon, but points out that it may be the enigmatic quality that Bond falls in love with. Benson also notes that Fleming gives relatively little information about the character, only how Bond reacts to her. The literary critic Dan Mills observes that with two strong female characters in the novel—Tracy and Irma Bunt—&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; subverts the conventions of the genre by having characters that are equally or more integral to and involved in the plot than their two counterparts, Bond and Blofeld.

Despite Tracy&#x27;s independent and assertive character, the media historian James Chapman observes that part of her role in the book is to act as &quot;a traditional ... male fantasy of women&#x27;s sexuality&quot;. This he asserts, is &quot;culturally problematic&quot; for readers of the 2010s. In doing do, he says, Tracy is fulfilling the same role as some of the women in the other Bond novels, including Jill Masterton in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, Domino Vitali in &quot;Thunderball&quot; and Viv in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;.

The cultural critic Umberto Eco lists Marc-Ange Draco among those characters in the Bond novels who undertake activities closer to those of the traditional villains, but who act on the side of good in support of Bond; others of this type include Darko Kerim (&quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;), Tiger Tanaka (&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;) and Enrico Colombo (the short story &quot;Risico&quot;). The historian Jeremy Black notes the connection between Draco and the Second World War; Draco wears the King&#x27;s medal for resistance fighters. The reference to the war is a method used by Fleming in several novels to differentiate good from evil; those who fought for the Allies—particularly Britain—were considered &quot;good&quot;, while Germans or those who supported them were &quot;bad&quot;. Draco&#x27;s medal for valour from Britain cements him as one of Bond&#x27;s core allies, despite his criminal activities.

The sociologist Anthony Synnott observes that many of the men who assist Bond are either handsome or striking looking; this includes Draco, about whom Fleming writes: &quot;The man had such a delightful face, so lit with humour and mischief and magnetism that ... Bond could no more have killed him than he could have killed, well, Tracy&quot;. Sable Basilisk is another who fits the same mould, according to Synnott, as Fleming describes him as &quot;rapier-slim, with a fine, thin, studious face that was saved from seriousness by wry lines at the edges of the mouth and an ironical glint in the level eyes&quot; Synnott considers that just as Bond&#x27;s allies are good looking, his enemies are, on the whole, unattractive and often grotesque. Irma Bunt—described by Mills as &quot;Blofeld&#x27;s asexual second in command&quot;—is evil and therefore ugly, according to Synnott. When the character first appears in the book, Fleming describes her as looking:

... like a very sunburnt female wardress. She had a square, brutal face with hard yellow eyes. Her smile was an oblong hole without humour or welcome, and there were sunburn blisters at the left corner of her mouth which she licked from time to time with the tip of a pale tongue. Wisps of brownish grey hair, with a tight, neat bun at the back, showed from under a skiing hat with a yellow talc visor that had straps which met under her chin. Her strong, short body was dressed in unbecomingly tight vorlage trousers topped by a grey wind-jacket ornamented over the left breast with a large red G topped by a coronet. Irma La not so Douce, thought Bond.

Blofeld differs from other villains in the Bond series, according to the literary historian Lars Ole Sauerberg. Sauerberg identifies Le Chiffre (&quot;Casino Royale&quot;) and Mr Big (&quot;Live and Let Die&quot;) as criminals with large ambitions and Hugo Drax, Doctor No and Goldfinger as those who commit crimes in order to complete their larger plans; all five are connected with the Soviet Union. Blofeld occupies his own classification as the only one of whom it is not possible to distinguish between a criminal act as a means or an end. Sauerberg considers that Blofeld&#x27;s motives are &quot;in his general nihilism and destructive urge&quot;. Synnott notes that not only are nearly all Bond&#x27;s enemies foreign, they are &quot;&quot;doubly&quot; foreign&quot;. Blofeld&#x27;s ancestry shows he is Polish and Greek and, during the Second World War, he had betrayed Poland by working with the , the Nazi military-intelligence service.

==Style==
Fleming later said of his work, &quot;while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L, it is possible to write what I can best describe as &#x27;thrillers designed to be read as literature&#x27;.&quot; He used well-known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which Amis called &quot;the Fleming effect&quot;. Amis describes it as &quot;the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond&#x27;s world ... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced&quot;. The literary critic Meir Sternberg observes that Fleming went to great lengths to research the background of various items used in the novels to give readers an impression of the lifestyle or background of the characters. Fleming would occasionally overreach with his descriptions, according to Jerry Palmer, who considers the description in the novel of &quot;Pinaud Elixir, that prince among shampoos&quot; as evidence of this.

Within the text Benson identifies what he described as the &quot;Fleming Sweep&quot;, the use of &quot;hooks&quot; at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. In &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; the sweep &quot;moves with confidence and readability&quot; to build the tension. Where the sweep is broken, it is at the visit to the College of Arms and at the meeting at M&#x27;s house; in both these parts, journalistic background provides necessary detail to enable the plot to proceed. The hooks combine with what the novelist Anthony Burgess calls &quot;a heightened journalistic style&quot;; this, says Fleming, produces &quot;a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery&quot;.

The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek sees &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; as a fable; he considers Fleming also saw this, and subverted some aspects of the convention within the novel, such as when Bond thinks that &quot;It would be amusing to reverse the old fable—first to rescue the girl, then to slay the monster&quot;. Panek sees aspects of fables in many of the Bond novels, often associated with the villains—Fleming describes Le Chiffre as an ogre, Mr Big as a giant, Drax (&quot;Moonraker&quot;) and Klebb (&quot;From Russia, With Love&quot;) as a dragon and a toad, respectively—and notes that &quot;Fleming puts damsels in distress in all the books&quot;.

==Themes==
&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; is one of three Bond novels to deal with the disruption of markets and the economy. &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; deals with the food supply or, as the literary analyst Sue Matheson considers it, &quot;the Cold War as a food chain&quot;. Wartime rationing had only finished nine years before the novel was published, and many readers still remembered the scarcity of food; Hugh Gaitskell, the Leader of the Labour Party, told Fleming in 1958 &quot;The combination of sex, violence, alcohol and—at intervals—good food and nice clothes is, to one who leads such a circumscribed life as I do, irresistible.&quot; The novel is &quot;one of the more food-oriented Bond books&quot;, according to the literary analyst Elizabeth Hale. Within the fifty-two days covered in the novel, eight meals are described, Bond&#x27;s drinks are enumerated and his thoughts on modern cooking and the standard in French restaurants are outlined. Writing in 2006, Val McDermid thought the threat in the novel had even more resonance for contemporary British readers than it would have done at the time of publishing, with public awareness of the BSE outbreak in the 1980s and 1990s and the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001. With the plot to render the UK agriculturally infertile, Mills considers &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; to have the most terrorist-centred plot in the series.

Benson states that gambling is a key theme of the novel, as it is in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. The gambling scene at the beginning of the novel leads to Bond entering a relationship with Tracy; Bond&#x27;s pretence of being Sir Hilary Bray to enter Piz Gloria to investigate Blofeld is also a form of gamble, according to Benson. Jeremy Black sees an unformulaic structure to the novel with the romance aspect both opening and closing the novel, which was not something Fleming did elsewhere in the series. Hale analyses the novel from the point of view of individualism: the plot starts with Bond alone, voluntarily, prior to meeting Tracy; it ends with him alone, involuntarily, after her murder. For most of the novel, Bond is a solo agent, cut off from the support of his service and reliant only on his abilities; this is in contrast to Blofeld who has a large organisation to support and protect him but still ends up on the losing side. For Black, the individualist tendency is also present in Bond&#x27;s allies, particularly Draco, who is prepared to help Bond attack Piz Gloria in part because of their shared rejection of authority. Lars Ole Sauerberg sees the assistance Draco gives Bond as a manner of distinguishing SPECTRE from other criminal organisations in what he calls &quot;the struggle of order against chaos&quot;; while Draco and the Unione Corse are conventional criminals, SPECTRE pursues—and represents—what Sauerberg calls &quot;absolute criminal anarchy&quot;.

==Publication and reception==
===Publication history===
&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; was published on 1 April 1963 in the UK as a hardcover edition by Jonathan Cape; it was 288 pages long. A limited edition of 285 copies was also printed; 250 were for sale, having been numbered and signed by Fleming, and the remainder were signed and marked &quot;For Presentation&quot;. The artist Richard Chopping undertook the cover illustration for the first edition, as he had done for all the previous Bond books. There were 42,000 advance orders for the hardback first edition and Cape did an immediate second impression of 15,000 copies, selling over 60,000 by the end of April 1963. By the end of 1963 it had sold in excess of 75,000 copies.

The novel was published in America in August 1963 by the New American Library, after Fleming changed publishers from Viking Press following &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;; &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; was 299 pages long. It was the first of Fleming&#x27;s novels listed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and topped it for over six months.

In September 1964—after Fleming&#x27;s death in May that year—Pan Books published a paperback version of &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; in the UK that sold 125,000 copies before the end of the year and 1.8 million in 1965. Since its initial publication the book has been re-issued in hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and, as at 2025, has never been out of print. In 2023 Ian Fleming Publications—the company that administers all Fleming&#x27;s literary works—had the Bond series edited as part of a sensitivity review to remove or reword some racial or ethnic descriptors. Although many of Fleming&#x27;s racial epithets were removed from the novel, the reference to &quot;homosexual tendencies&quot; being one of the &quot;stubborn disabilities&quot; treatable by hypnosis was retained in the new release. The release of the bowdlerised series was for the 70th anniversary of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, the first Bond novel.

===Critical reception===
In &quot;The Observer&quot;, Maurice Richardson pondered if there had been &quot;a deliberate moral reformation&quot; of Bond, although he noted Bond still had his harder side when needed. Marghanita Laski, writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, thought that &quot;the new James Bond we&#x27;ve been meeting of late [is] somehow gentler, more sentimental, less &quot;dirty&quot;&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Jerry Doolittle thought that Bond is &quot;still irresistible to women, still handsome in a menacing way, still charming. He has nerves of steel and of whipcord&quot;, even if &quot;he&#x27;s starting to look a little older&quot;.

The critic for &quot;The Times&quot; considered that after &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, &quot;&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; constitutes a substantial, if not quite a complete, recovery&quot;. In the view of the reviewer, it was enough of a recovery for them to point out that &quot;it is time, perhaps, to forget the much exaggerated things which have been said about sex, sadism and snobbery, and return to the simple, indisputable fact that Mr. Fleming is a most compelling story-teller&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the critic Anthony Berkeley Cox, under the name Francis Iles, considered that &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; was &quot;not only up to Mr. Fleming&#x27;s usual level, but perhaps even a bit above it&quot;. Richardson also thought that &quot;in reforming Bond Mr. Fleming has reformed his own story-telling which had been getting very loose&quot;. Overall he thought that &quot;&quot;O.H.M.S.S.&quot; is certainly the best Bond for several books. It is better plotted and retains its insane grip until the end&quot;. Mortimer, in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, thought the novel Fleming&#x27;s best; despite innovations for the Bond formula, Mortimer noted that overall, &quot;the pattern here ... is traditional&quot;. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; thought &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; to be &quot;solid Fleming&quot;, and the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; considered the novel to be &quot;Fleming at his urbanely murderous best, a notable chapter in the saga of James Bond&quot;. Gene Brackley, writing in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; about the fantastic nature of the plots, suggested that &quot;Fleming&#x27;s accounts of the half-world of the Secret Service have the ring of authenticity&quot; because of his previous role with the Naval Intelligence Division. Doolittle considered that &quot;Fleming&#x27;s new book will not disappoint his millions of fans&quot;. The critic for &quot;Time&quot; magazine referred to previous criticism of Fleming and thought that &quot;in Fleming&#x27;s latest Bond bombshell, there are disquieting signs that he took the critics to heart&quot; when they complained about &quot;the consumer snobbery of his caddish hero&quot;. The critic mourned that even worse was to follow, when &quot;Bond is threatened with what, for an international cad, would clearly be a fate worse than death: matrimony&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Anthony Boucher—later described by John Pearson as &quot;throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man&quot;—was again critical, although he wrote that &quot;you can&#x27;t argue with success&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;simply &quot;&quot;, I must set down my opinion that this is a silly and tedious novel&quot;. Boucher went on to bemoan that although &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; was better than &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, &quot;it is still a lazy and inadequate story&quot;, going on to say that &quot;my complaint is not that the adventures of James Bond are bad literature ... but that they aren&#x27;t good bad literature&quot;. Laski considered, however, that &quot;it really is time to stop treating Ian Fleming as a Significant Portent, and to accept him as a good, if rather vulgar thriller-writer, well suited to his times and to us his readers&quot;.

Robert Kirsch, writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, considered Fleming&#x27;s work to be a significant point in fiction, saying that the Bond novels &quot;are harbingers of a change in emphasis in fiction which is important&quot;. The importance, Kirsch claimed, sprung from &quot;a revolution in taste, a return to qualities in fiction which [are] all but submerged in the 20th-century vogue of realism and naturalism&quot; and the importance was such that they were &quot;comparable ... only to the phenomenon of Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; stories&quot;. Kirsch also believed that &quot;with Fleming, ... we do not merely accept the willing suspension of disbelief, we yearn for it, we hunger for it&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Following the success of the publication of the short story &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot; in &quot;Playboy&quot; in March 1960, Fleming chose to serialise &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; in the magazine in the April, May and June 1963 issues. The novel was also serialised in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; between 18 and 29 March 1963, and adapted as a daily comic strip for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and syndicated worldwide; the strip ran for nearly a year, from 29 June 1964 to 17 May 1965. The adaptation was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky. The strip was reprinted by Titan Books in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, published in 2004, and again in &quot;The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2&quot;, published in 2011.

In 1969 &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; was adapted into the sixth film in the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series by Eon Productions. It starred George Lazenby in his only appearance in the Bond role, with Diana Rigg as Tracy. With the films being produced in a different order to the books, the continuity of storylines was broken and the films altered accordingly. Even so, Bond had met Blofeld in the previous film, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;: this previous meeting was ignored for the plot of &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. Only minor changes to the novel&#x27;s plot were made.

In 2014 the novel was adapted for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Drama&quot; strand. Toby Stephens, who played Gustav Graves in &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, portrayed Bond. Joanna Lumley appeared in both the film and radio adaptations of the novel.

<text>Giant slalom (GS) is an alpine skiing and alpine snowboarding competitive discipline. It involves racing between sets of poles (&quot;gates&quot;) spaced at a greater distance from each other than in slalom but less than in Super-G.

Giant slalom and slalom make up the technical events in alpine ski racing. This category separates them from the speed events of Super-G and downhill. The technical events are normally composed of two runs, held on different courses on the same ski run.

==Course==
The vertical drop for a GS course must be for men, and for women. The number of gates in this event is 56–70 for men and 46–58 for women. The number of direction changes in a GS course equals 11–15% of the vertical drop of the course in metres, 13–18% for children. As an example, a course with a vertical drop of would have 33–45 direction changes for an adult race.

==Speed==

Although giant slalom is not the fastest event in skiing, on average a well-trained racer may reach average speeds of .

==Equipment==

Giant slalom skis are shorter than super-G and downhill skis, and longer than slalom skis.

In an attempt to increase safety for the 2003–04 season, the International Ski Federation (FIS) increased the minimum sidecut radius for giant slalom skis to and for the first time imposed minimum ski lengths for GS: for men and for women. A maximum stand height (the distance from the snow to the sole of the boot) of was also established for all disciplines.

In May 2006, the FIS announced further changes to the rules governing equipment. Beginning with the 2007–08 season, the minimum radius for GS skis was increased to for men and for women. Additionally, the minimum ski width at the waist was increased from , and the maximum stand height for all disciplines was reduced to . The best skiers tended to use a bigger sidecut radius, like Ted Ligety at , and Lindsey Vonn at .

For the 2012–13 season, the FIS increased the sidecut radius to and the minimal length to . Many athletes criticized this decision. Often David Dodge was cited. Dodge argues that FIS used studies which do not represent a scientific proof. He states that it is well known that if one tips the ski 7° more the 35 m ski will have the same turning radius as the 28 m ski. He states as well that knee injuries are decreasing since the 1990s, when carving skis started to be used.

According to the FIS &quot;Specification for Alpine Competition Equipment&quot; for the 2024–2025 season, the specifications for FIS World Cup GS skis are as follows: the minimum sidecut radius is 30 m (98 ft) for both men and women, and the minimum ski lengths are 188 cm (74 in) for women and 193 cm (75.9 in) for men.

==History==
The first giant slalom was set in 1935 on the Mottarone in Italy, over Lake Maggiore, near Stresa, on January 20.
After one month, the second giant slalom was set on the Marmolada in Italy&#x27;s Dolomite mountains, by Guenther Langes.

The giant slalom was added to the world championships in 1950 at Aspen, Colorado, and debuted at the Winter Olympics in 1952 at Oslo, Norway, run at Norefjell. The GS has been run in every world championships and Olympics since. Originally a one-run event, a second run was added for men at the world championships in 1966, run on consecutive days, and at the Olympics in 1968. The second run for women was added at the world championships in 1978, and made its Olympic debut in 1980.

The world championships changed to a one-day format for the giant slalom in 1974, but the Olympics continued the GS as a two-day event through 1980. Also scheduled for two days in 1984, both giant slaloms became one-day events after repeated postponements of the downhills. Following the extra races added to the program in 1988, the GS has been scheduled as a one-day event at the Olympics.

Upon its introduction, giant slalom briefly displaced the combined event at the world championships; it was absent in 1950 and 1952. The combined returned in 1954 in Åre, Sweden, but as a &quot;paper race,&quot; using the results of the three events (downhill, giant slalom, and slalom), a format used through 1980. The combined returned as a stand-alone event at the world championships in 1982 at Schladming, Austria, and at the 1988 Calgary Olympics. It was changed to the super-combined format (one run of slalom on same day as downhill) at the world championships in 2007 and the Olympics in 2010.

<text>The Lord High Treasurer was an English government position and has been a British government position since the Acts of Union of 1707. A holder of the post would be the third-highest-ranked Great Officer of State in England, below the Lord High Steward and the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

The Lord High Treasurer functions as the head of His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury. The office has, since the resignation of Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury in 1714, been vacant.

Although the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was created in 1801, it was not until the Consolidated Fund Act 1816 that the separate offices of Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain and Lord High Treasurer of Ireland were united into one office as the &quot;Lord High Treasurer of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; on 5 January 1817.

Section 2 of the Consolidated Fund Act 1816 also provides that &quot;whenever there shall not be [a Lord High Treasurer of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland], it shall ... be lawful for His Majesty, by letters patent under the Great Seal of Great Britain, to appoint Commissioners for executing the Offices of Treasurer of the Exchequer of Great Britain and Lord High Treasurer of Ireland&quot;. These are the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. In modern times, by convention, the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury include the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, usually serving as the First Lord of the Treasury, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, serving as the Second Lord of the Treasury. Other members of the government, usually whips in the House of Commons, are appointed to serve as the Junior Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.

== Origins ==
The English Treasury seems to have come into existence around 1126, during the reign of Henry I, as the financial responsibilities were separated from the rest of the job that evolved into Lord Great Chamberlain. The Treasury was originally a section of the Royal Household with custody of the King&#x27;s money. In 1216, a Treasurer was appointed to take control of the Treasury in Winchester. The Treasurer was also an officer of the Exchequer, and supervised the royal accounts. It was in the 16th century, the office&#x27;s title of &quot;King&#x27;s Treasurer&quot; developed into &quot;Lord High Treasurer&quot;. By Tudor times, the Lord High Treasurer had achieved a place among the Great Officers of State, behind the Lord Chancellor and above the Master of the Horse. Under the Treason Act 1351 it is treason to kill him.

The office of Lord High Treasurer is distinct from that of Treasurer of the Exchequer. The Lord High Treasurer was appointed by the delivery of a white staff to the appointee, and the Treasurer of the Exchequer was appointed at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure by letters patent under the Great Seal of the Realm. However, when the Treasury was held by an individual, he was appointed to both offices. It is the office of Treasurer of the Exchequer that is put into commission, not the office of Lord High Treasurer. When the office of Treasurer of the Exchequer is put into commission, the office of Lord High Treasurer is left vacant.

During the sixteenth century, the Lord High Treasurer was often considered the most important official of the government, and became a &quot;de facto&quot; Prime Minister. Exemplifying the power of the Lord High Treasurer is William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, who served in the post from 1572 to 1598. During his tenure, he dominated the administration under Elizabeth I.

<text> (; ) is a German rock band from Berlin. The band has released 14 studio albums. The group consists of guitarist Farin Urlaub, drummer Bela B and bass player Rodrigo González. All three write and perform their songs.

== History ==
=== 1982–1985: Early years, debut album ===
 were formed in West Berlin in 1982 by Jan Vetter (alias Farin Urlaub, a pun on the expression &quot;Fahr&#x27; in Urlaub&quot;, meaning &quot;Go on vacation&quot;), Dirk Felsenheimer (alias Bela B, referring to Dracula actor Bela Lugosi) and bassist Hans Runge, alias . Bela and Farin had previously played together in the punk band Soilent Grün, established in 1979 and named after the film &quot;Soylent Green&quot;.

After Soilent Grün broke up in 1982, Bela and Farin decided to form another band. In the first two years (including Sahnie) they mostly played in clubs in their hometown, Berlin. Their first release was a contribution to the sampler &quot;20 schäumende Stimmungshits&quot; (rough translation: &quot;20 foamy party hits&quot;), featuring a strong alcohol theme (for example, the chorus of &quot;Vollmilch&quot; translates as &quot;you drink whiskey, he drinks beer, I drink milk&quot;). In 1983 they won a rock contest in Berlin and with the prize money they recorded their debut EP &quot;Uns geht&#x27;s prima...&quot; (&quot;We&#x27;re doing great...&quot;). Finally CBS signed them, and they released their first LP &quot;Debil&quot; (&quot;Moronic&quot;) with their second LP following in 1984 with &quot;Im Schatten der Ärzte&quot; (&quot;In the shadow of &quot;) a year later.

=== 1986–1989: Success, controversies, line-up change, breakup ===
After the second album, they parted ways with Sahnie due to internal problems. Producer Manfred &#x27;Manne&#x27; Praeker played the bass parts on the third album. Later, Hagen Liebing (&quot;The Incredible Hagen&quot;) took over as bassist for live concerts, although he never became an official member of the band, with Farin playing bass on the following albums. The third album was also the first time that Farin used distorted guitar sounds on most of the album, moving the band&#x27;s sound towards rock. In 1987, the German Federal Centre for Media Harmful to Young Persons put the songs &quot;Geschwisterliebe&quot; (&quot;Sibling love&quot;, a song about incest, from the album ), &quot;Claudia hat &#x27;nen Schäferhund&quot; (&quot;Claudia has a German Shepherd&quot;, about zoophilia, from &quot;Debil&quot;) and &quot;Schlaflied&quot; (&quot;Lullaby&quot;, about a monster coming and eating its victim after falling asleep, also from &quot;Debil&quot;) on the German List of Media Harmful to Young People (often called &quot;the Index&quot;). 
This prohibited the band from performing the songs live or promoting the two albums and, more importantly, shops were prohibited from openly displaying these records or selling them to minors. At their concerts, they circumvented the ban by playing only the music of the prohibited songs, while the audience sang the lyrics. After several trials against shops that still openly sold the records, a lot of shops completely removed from their stock. The result was a drop in record sales and financial problems for the band. In response they released the best of album &quot;Ist das alles?&quot; (&quot;Is that all?&quot;) with three new songs and the 10&quot; compilation &quot;Ab 18&quot; (Adults only) containing all indexed songs and some other songs with controversial, mainly sex-themed lyrics. Although advice not to sell the album to minors was printed on the cover, &quot;Ab 18&quot; was also put on the index.

The inner sleeve was put on the index separately because it contained the lyrics. Some tour posters were considered misogynistic and were also put on the list. They contained a drawing of a tied up and gagged woman called Gwendoline that was inspired by bondage artist John Willie and is the mascot of the band. Since then, have used a skeleton version of Gwendoline in the artwork of most of their albums.
Later, from 2000 on, live shows have featured two oversized Gwendolines that flank the stage (especially at outdoor concerts). The commissioned artist had first colored the figures independently. However, after the Hard Pop Days were played with these colorful editions and a houseboat at Popkomm in Cologne was adorned with them, they were recolored into classic black and white design.

The following album &quot;Das ist nicht die ganze Wahrheit...&quot; (&quot;That is not the whole truth...&quot;) was even more successful; it charted in the top 10 of the German album charts. decided to go out on a high note and split up after doing one last tour and releasing a triple live album, &quot;Nach uns die Sintflut&quot; (&quot;Devil may care&quot;, lit. &quot;After us the deluge&quot;), later released as a double CD, that became their first number one in the album charts.

In 1989, they released one last single from the &quot;Wahrheit&quot; LP and a compilation of early EPs and rare recordings (&quot;Die Ärzte früher!&quot; (&quot;Die Ärzte earlier!&quot;).

=== 1993–1999: Reunion, new bassist, first no.1 single ===

Neither Farin&#x27;s new band King Køng nor Bela&#x27;s Depp Jones became successful, so they decided to reform in 1993. They invited former Depp Jones guitarist Rodrigo González to take over on bass duties. He would also play guitar on songs he (co-)wrote. They released the comeback album &quot;Die Bestie in Menschengestalt&quot; (&quot;The beast in human form&quot;) and the single &quot;Schrei nach Liebe&quot; (&quot;Cry for love&quot;), their first song to have political lyrics. It was recorded as a statement against the increasing racism and right-wing extremist violence in Germany at that time. The translation of the song&#x27;s refrain is &quot;Your violence is just a silent cry for love / Your combat boots are craving for tenderness / You never learned to express yourself / And your parents never had time for you / Oh oh oh asshole&quot;. The album was more varied than previous releases, including ballads, punk, rock and even a song resembling &quot;Volksmusik&quot;. Both the album and single became big hits in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The follow-up &quot;Planet Punk&quot; was also very successful.

In 1996, they wanted to make an EP just about hair, however, they wrote too many songs for an EP and it became their next album, &quot;Le Frisur&quot;. It was not as successful as its predecessors. Also during this year, as well as touring in their own right, they also supported Kiss on the German dates of their  Alive/Worldwide Tour — a dream come true for Bela and Rod. In 1998 their single &quot;Männer sind Schweine&quot; (&quot;Men are pigs&quot;) became their first number 1 single in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, with the album &quot;13&quot; also being number 1 in Germany and Switzerland. After a lot of promotion and touring that year, they decided to take a break and also to never again play &quot;Männer sind Schweine&quot; during concerts, due in part to its huge chart success, which in turn attracted remakes, e.g. &quot;Frauen sind Schweine&quot; (&quot;Women are pigs&quot;).

=== 2000–2013: Further success, &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, solo work ===
In 2000 they came back with the album, &quot;Runter mit den Spendierhosen, Unsichtbarer!&quot; (&quot;Stop feeling so generous, invisible one!&quot;, lit.: &quot;Down with the generosity trousers, invisible one!&quot;), and two top 10 singles. For the third single from the album they released the 30-second-song &quot;Yoko Ono&quot;, which, according to the Guinness Book of Records, is the shortest single ever released (with a videoclip)—another example of their sense of humour. During their tour in 2001 they sold the limited edition album &quot;5, 6, 7, 8 - Bullenstaat!&quot; (&quot;5,6,7,8 – Cop State!&quot;) consisting of short punk songs that were written and recorded with the previous years full-length album published a year before, and with some cover songs that were published in 1995 (another tour only EP).

After that, they again took a break. During the break Bela did some acting and Farin recorded his first solo album &quot;Endlich Urlaub!&quot; (&quot;Holiday at last!&quot;). In late 2002, they did an MTV Unplugged session in a school auditorium with the school&#x27;s band (Albert Schweitzer Gymnasium, Hamburg, Germany), which they released under the title &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Realschule&quot; (in allusion to the Ramones&#x27; song and the film &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;). The following year they released a new two-CD album, &quot;Geräusch&quot; (&quot;Noise&quot;). In December 2003 a live DVD was recorded and published the following year.

While the band was on another break, Farin released another solo album &quot;Am Ende der Sonne&quot; (&quot;At the end of the Sun&quot;). In 2005 a new version of the album &quot;Debil&quot; was released under the name &quot;Devil&quot; containing the original track listings plus some B-sides and previously unreleased bonus material. The album can now be sold legally, since all the tracks from the original LP have been removed from the Index. Only Geschwisterliebe remains there. In 2006, Bela B made a solo album, &quot;Bingo&quot;. On 2 November 2007, Die Ärzte released their latest album, &quot;Jazz ist anders&quot; (&quot;Jazz is nothing like this&quot;, lit. &quot;Jazz is different&quot;), which was preceded by the single &quot;Junge&quot; (&quot;Boy&quot;). &quot;Junge&quot; was shown for the first time on MTV TRL Germany on 14 September 2007. The album was followed by two tours, in winter 2007 and summer 2008.

After they played a few concerts in 2009, they took a break. In April 2011, they toured under the pseudonym &quot;Laternen-Joe&quot; and, in December, they gave two special concerts at the Westfalenhalle in Dortmund, one only for women, and one only for men.

In 2012, Die Ärzte released their next record &quot;auch&quot; (&quot;as well&quot;, &quot;also&quot;), preceded by the single &quot;zeiDverschwÄndung&quot; (&quot;wÄste of time&quot;). From May to August, as well as November and December in the same year, they went on two concert tours throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Their concerts at the Festhalle Frankfurt and the Waldbühne Berlin were used for a live album and concert film called &quot;Die Nacht der Dämonen&quot; (&quot;Night of the Demons&quot;), which was released in 2013. In 2013 Die Ärzte also went on another concert tour, this time mainly playing large open air and stadium concerts.

=== Since 2013: hiatus, more albums, further touring ===
Die Ärzte made a surprise appearance playing &quot;Schrei nach Liebe&quot; at &quot;Jamel Rock den Förster&quot; in 2015, an antiracist and antifascist music festival in Jamel, a small village in Northeastern Germany that is mainly inhabited by Neo-Nazis, as well as two married artists, who organise the festival every year.
In that same year, among rising anti-immigration tensions in Germany, their anti-Nazi song &quot;Schrei nach Liebe&quot; reached No.1 in the German charts, 22 years after its original release. 

In 2016, their former bassist Hagen Liebing died, at age 55. In the same year, another biography, &quot;Das Buch Ä&quot; (&quot;the book Ä&quot;), was released, revealing the band had been on bad terms during the 2013 tour and was inactive afterwards (apart from the Jamel appearance). The three band members all released further solo work, however.

In June 2019, die Ärzte played headlining shows at the festivals Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in Germany, Nova Rock Festival in Austria, as well as Open Air St. Gallen in Switzerland. These shows were exclusive in their respective countries. Before these festivals, die Ärzte played a club tour in non-German speaking parts of Europe in May. These were their first full live shows since 2013.

In October 2020, die Ärzte released their first studio album in 8 years, &quot;Hell&quot; (&quot;bright&quot;). The tour that was meant to follow the album was first postponed into 2021 before being completely cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, die Ärzte then released another studio album, &quot;Dunkel&quot; (&quot;dark&quot;). They went on two concert tours in 2022, one regular stadium and open air tour, as well as a tour where they exclusively played in Berlin, where they went from small clubs that hold 150 people, over medium-sized concert halls, up to the Tempelhofer Feld, where they played for 60 000 people on two days each (a third concert had to be cancelled on the day due to a thunderstorm). This tour was designed to help the local Berlin venues after the pandemic.

In 2023, they played a further tour, announced only a week before it started (and sold out within minutes), and announced two further concerts at Tempelhofer Feld for 2024.

=== Relationship with Die Toten Hosen ===
Throughout their career, Die Ärzte have often been compared to fellow German punk band Die Toten Hosen; a comparison that has often been stylized as a rivalry by the media despite both bands never having an official feud. The comparisons are mostly drawn because of a similar origin as both bands were pioneers of the German punk rock scene and started around the same time in the early 1980s, in both cases evolving from earlier locally famous punk bands (Die Ärzte from &quot;Soilent Grün&quot; and Die Toten Hosen from &quot;ZK&quot;). Furthermore, both bands are heavily linked to their cities of origin: Die Ärzte from Berlin and Die Toten Hosen from Düsseldorf. While Die Ärzte are generally known for their more humorous approach to music, Die Toten Hosen also have a couple of humorous songs, mostly about alcohol. Both bands enjoyed a similar career trajectory and success (with the most notable difference being the 5-year hiatus of Die Ärzte). Due to all of these similarities, multiple media outlets in Germany tried to establish a Beatles/Stones-style rivalry between both bands. While both bands admit to a certain level of competition and rivalry between them in the past, including a physical altercations in the early 80s, both bands are amicable towards each other today, if not poking fun at said &quot;rivalry&quot;.

Adopting aliases Die Ärzte and Die Toten Hosen have played small club shows together in the past. In 2012 Die Toten Hosen covered Die Ärzte&#x27;s &quot;Schrei nach Liebe&quot; on the bonus disc for their album &quot;Ballast der Republik&quot;. The same year, they covered the song while headlining Germany&#x27;s biggest rock festival Rock am Ring and have continued playing the songs live on multiple occasions. In the music video for die Ärzte&#x27;s &quot;Noise&quot; , as Bela B, Die Toten Hosen drummer Vom Ritchie makes an appearancen playing drums with a Toten Hosen banner behind him, before being chased out by the band.

In June 2022 Die Ärzte appeared at one of the 40th anniversary concerts Die Toten Hosen gave in Düsseldorf. They first performed two Die Toten Hosen songs on their own, before being joined by Die Toten Hosen for &quot;Schrei nach Liebe&quot; and &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;.

== Band name ==
The band name &quot;Die Ärzte&quot; was decided upon after Farin Urlaub and Bela B noticed that the folder with the umlaut &quot;Ä&quot; was empty in most record stores. Since their 2003 album &quot;Geräusch&quot;, they have stylized their name with three dots over the &quot;ä&quot; in &quot;ärzte&quot;, intended as a play on the heavy metal umlaut. While the A with triple-dot diacritic does not represent any real language construct, it can be represented in Unicode as &quot;A⃛&quot; using the combining character U+20DB .

The three dots also symbolize the three members of the band. The German cartoonist Schwarwel, who also directed music videos for famous pop punk bands including Good Charlotte and Unwritten Law, realized the idea. &quot;Die Ärzte&quot;, with two dots, is correct German orthography and not related to the heavy metal umlaut in any way. They often call themselves &quot;Die beste Band der Welt&quot; (&quot;The best band in the world&quot;) in jest due to them wondering why they have so many fans. They often change their band name for short periods, sometimes only a matter of days. For example, they called themselves &quot;Die Köche&quot; (&quot;The cooks&quot;) to promote their 2007 album &quot;Jazz ist anders&quot; (&quot;Jazz is different&quot;), relevant due to the album art&#x27;s pizza theme. By adopting new names, the band is able to avoid attracting large crowds, allowing them to hold small concerts.

==International reception==
The band has been very popular in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, while also enjoying some success in other Northern European countries. Unlike fellow early 1980s German punk band Die Toten Hosen (whose career has often been compared to Die Ärzte, often trying to promote a rivalry), Die Ärzte are largely unknown outside of these countries, aside from descendants of German nationals abroad as well as many students. The band considered releasing an album in English in the mid-1990s, but they dropped the idea. The songs recorded for said album were released in 2018 on the compilations &quot;Seitenhirsch&quot; and &quot;They&#x27;ve given me Schrott&quot;. 

In 2002, they did a short tour in Japan and released a compilation (titled simply &quot;die ärzte&quot;) of their last albums there, and in 2004 they did a short tour in South America. 

On occasion (for example concerts in 2008, 2019, 2023), they also played non-German-speaking countries of Europe, such as Poland, Czechia, Croatia, Slovenia, Italy, France, the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Luxembourg, Russia, the Netherlands and Belgium.

<doc id="344843" wikidata="Q1124015" url="?curid=344843" title="Concilium Germanicum">
<text>The Concilium Germanicum was the first major Church synod to be held in the eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms. It was called by Carloman on 21 April 742/743 at an unknown location, and presided over by Boniface, who was solidified in his position as leader of the Austrasian church. German historian Gunther Wolf judges that the Concilium was the high point in Boniface&#x27;s long career.

==Background==
Much of the documentation pertaining to the Concilium relies on Boniface and documents associated with his life, and while the saint was prone to rhetorical embellishment and exaggeration in his correspondence, his assessment of the situation in the Frankish church appears to be reliable, although in some details he was off by a few years—the last synod in the Frankish church appears to have been held in 695 in Auxerre. He outlines three main problems in a letter written early in 742 to the newly elected Pope Zachary:
*Church regulations (esp. in regard to property) had been disregarded for six decades or more;
*There had been no church synods for at least eighty years;
*There were no archbishops in the Frankish church, and bishops (many without a fixed see) and priests were only interested in the material benefits of the office, stealing church property and living worldly lifestyles, which included living with concubines, drinking, and hunting.

Boniface had begun his reform attempts of the Frankish church in the 730s, and by the 740s had found a kindred spirit in Carloman, the more religiously oriented of Charles Martel&#x27;s two sons who divided their father&#x27;s domain. When Carloman promised Boniface a synod, he saw an opportunity to address two of his main interests in his reform efforts: to protect church property from a rapacious gentry, and to impose stricter guidelines on the clergy.

==Decisions and outcome==
Participation in the Concilium was restricted to Boniface&#x27;s supporters, and among those invited were the bishops of Carloman&#x27;s Austrasia. As well as Boniface (who, as archbishop, presided over the synod) the bishops of Cologne, Strasbourg, and Büraburg were present, as was a chorbishop named Willibald and a bishop named Dadan (who was possibly from Erfurt or an auxiliary bishop from Utrecht). Absent were the bishops from Utrecht, Metz, Verdun, Speyer, and Liège. Boniface&#x27;s main opponents, Milo, bishop of Reims, and Gewilip, bishop of Mainz, failed to appear.

Strengthened by the absence of his enemies, Boniface succeeded in having stricter guidelines adopted, but the effort to re-appropriate church property was thwarted by bishops and nobility alike.

The measures adopted at the Concilium included:

*Archbishops and bishops with a fixed see were to be appointed to replace the noble laypersons who had received dioceses under Charles Martel;
*Bishops were required to visit their parishes, with the aid of auxiliary bishops;
*Clergy were required to appear annually before the bishop to give a reckoning of their personal and official activities;
*On Maundy Thursday, bishops were to consecrate oil (chrism) during a special mass, with which all the parishes in their diocese were to be supplied;
*Clergy were not allowed to carry weapons, and were forbidden to hunt;
*The Rule of Saint Benedict became mandatory for all monasteries.

Many of the Concilium&#x27;s measures were geared toward a stricter organization of the Frankish church, and to enforce such organization annual synods were called for, as well as real bishops and archbishops and the enforcement of canon law.

Church historian Matthias Schuler, commenting on Boniface&#x27;s failure to have church property returned to the church, proposes that the time was not yet ripe for Carloman to re-appropriate those properties, which had often been handed (by way of church offices) to various noblemen by his father, Charles Martel, to appease them and strengthen their loyalty. Re-appropriation would have led to widespread anger and distaste for the reform movement. A (partial) redress of the situation was decided on in the next of Boniface&#x27;s Frankish synods, that of Estinnes, 1 March 743. Whereas Gunther Wolf judged that the Concilium was the high point in Boniface&#x27;s long career, other scholars such as Matthias Schuler place that high point in 747, Boniface&#x27;s Frankish synod.

==Date==
There is still some contention among scholars about the date. Theodor Schieffer (in his 1954 biography of the saint) maintained 743, &quot;pace&quot; Heinz Löwe, as do Kurt-Ulrich Jäschke and Alain Dierkens. It is still being discussed, but 742 is maintained most notably by Heinz Löwe, and this date was most recently given by Michael Glatthaar and Michael E. Moore.

<text>An equestrian statue is a statue of a rider mounted on a horse, from the Latin &quot;eques&quot;, meaning &#x27;knight&#x27;, deriving from &quot;equus&quot;, meaning &#x27;horse&#x27;. A statue of a riderless horse is strictly an equine statue. A full-sized equestrian statue is a difficult and expensive object for any culture to produce, and figures have typically been portraits of rulers or, in the Renaissance and more recently, military commanders.

Although there are outliers, the form is essentially a tradition in Western art, used for imperial propaganda by the Roman emperors, with a significant revival in Italian Renaissance sculpture, which continued across Europe in the Baroque, as mastering the large-scale casting of bronze became more widespread, and later periods. 

Statues at well under life-size have been popular in various materials, including porcelain, since the Renaissance. The riders in these may not be portraits, but figures from classical mythology or generic figures such as Native Americans. 

==History==
===Ancient Greece===
Equestrian statuary in the West dates back at least as far as Archaic Greece. Found on the Athenian acropolis, the sixth-century BC statue known as the Rampin Rider depicts a &quot;kouros&quot; mounted on horseback.

===Ancient Middle and Far East===
A number of ancient Egyptian, Assyrian and Persian reliefs show mounted figures, usually rulers, though no free-standing statues are known. The Chinese Terracotta Army has no mounted riders, though cavalrymen stand beside their mounts, but smaller Tang dynasty pottery tomb Qua figures often include them, at a relatively small scale. No Chinese portrait equestrian statues were made until modern times; statues of rulers are not part of traditional Chinese art, and indeed even painted portraits were only shown to high officials on special occasions until the eleventh century.

===Ancient Rome===
Such statues frequently commemorated military leaders, and those statesmen who wished to symbolically emphasize the active leadership role undertaken since Roman times by the equestrian class, the &quot;equites&quot; (plural of &quot;eques&quot;) or knights.

There were numerous bronze equestrian portraits (particularly of the emperors) in ancient Rome, but they did not survive because they were melted down for reuse of the alloy as coin, church bells, or other, smaller projects (such as new sculptures for Christian churches); the standing Colossus of Barletta lost parts of his legs and arms to Dominican bells in 1309. Almost the only sole surviving Roman equestrian bronze, the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome, owes its preservation on the Campidoglio, to the popular misidentification of Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher-emperor, with Constantine the Great, the Christian emperor. The &quot;Regisole&quot; (&quot;Sun King&quot;) was a bronze classical or Late Antique equestrian monument of a ruler, highly influential during the Italian Renaissance but destroyed in 1796 in the wake of the French Revolution. It was originally erected at Ravenna, but moved to Pavia in the Middle Ages, where it stood on a column before the cathedral. A fragment of an equestrian portrait sculpture of Augustus has also survived.

===Medieval Europe===

Equestrian statues were not very frequent in the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, there are some examples, like the Bamberg Horseman (German: &quot;Der Bamberger Reiter&quot;), in Bamberg Cathedral. Another example is the &quot;Magdeburg Reiter&quot;, in the city of Magdeburg, that depicts Emperor Otto I. This is in stone, which is fairly unusual at any period, though the Gothic statues at less than life-size at the Scaliger Tombs in Verona are also in stone. 

There are a few roughly half-size statues of &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot;, including the famous ones in Prague and Stockholm. A well-known small bronze equestrian statuette of Charlemagne (or another emperor) in Paris may be a contemporary portrait of Charlemagne, although its date and subject are uncertain.

===Renaissance===
After the Romans, no surviving monumental equestrian bronze was cast in Europe until 1415–1450, when Donatello created the heroic bronze equestrian statue of Gattamelata the &quot;condottiere&quot;, erected in Padua. In fifteenth-century Italy, this became a form to memorialize successful mercenary generals, as evidenced by the painted equestrian funerary monuments to Sir John Hawkwood and Niccolò da Tolentino in Florence Cathedral, and the statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni (1478–1488) cast by Verrocchio in Venice.

Leonardo da Vinci had planned a colossal equestrian monument to the Milanese ruler, Francesco Sforza, but was only able to create a clay model. The bronze was reallocated for military use in the First Italian War. Similar sculptures have survived in small scale: The Wax Horse and Rider (–1508) is a fragmentary model for an equestrian statue of Charles d&#x27;Amboise. The Rearing Horse and Mounted Warrior in bronze was also attributed to Leonardo.

Titian&#x27;s equestrian portrait of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, of 1548 applied the form again to a ruler. The equestrian statue of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici (1598) by Giambologna in the center of Florence was a life size representation of the Grand-Duke, erected by his son Ferdinand I.

Ferdinand himself would be memorialized in 1608 with an equestrian statue in Piazza della Annunziata was completed by Giambologna&#x27;s assistant, Pietro Tacca. Tacca&#x27;s studio would produce such models for the rulers in France and Spain. His last public commission was the colossal equestrian bronze of Philip IV, begun in 1634 and shipped to Madrid in 1640. In Tacca&#x27;s sculpture, atop a fountain composition that forms the centerpiece of the façade of the Royal Palace, the horse rears, and the entire weight of the sculpture balances on the two rear legs, and discreetly, its tail, a novel feat for a statue of this size.

===Absolutism===
During the age of Absolutism, especially in France, equestrian statues were popular with rulers; Louis XIV was typical in having one outside his Palace of Versailles, and the over life-size statue in the Place des Victoires in Paris by François Girardon (1699) is supposed to be the first large modern equestrian statue to be cast in a single piece; it was destroyed in the French Revolution, though there is a small version in the Louvre. The near life-size equestrian statue of Charles I of England by Hubert Le Sueur of 1633 at Charing Cross in London is the earliest large English example, which was followed by many. 

The equestrian statue of King José I of Portugal, in the Praça do Comércio, was designed by Joaquim Machado de Castro after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and is a pinnacle of Absolutist age statues in Europe. The &quot;Bronze Horseman&quot; (, literally &quot;The Copper Horseman&quot;) is an iconic equestrian statue, on a huge base, of Peter the Great of 1782 by Étienne Maurice Falconet in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The use of French artists for both examples demonstrates the slow spread of the skills necessary for creating large works, but by the nineteenth century most large Western countries could produce them without the need to import skills, and most statues of earlier figures are actually from the nineteenth or early twentieth century.
===United States===

In the colonial era, an equestrian statue of George III by English sculptor Joseph Wilton stood on Bowling Green in New York City. This was the first such statue in the United States, erected in 1770 but destroyed on July 9, 1776, six days after the Declaration of Independence. The gilded lead statue was toppled and cut into pieces, which were made into bullets for use in the American Revolutionary War. Some fragments survived and in 2016 the statue was recreated for a museum.

In the United States, the first three full-scale equestrian sculptures erected were Clark Mills&#x27; &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; (1852) in Washington, D.C.; Henry Kirke Brown&#x27;s &quot;George Washington&quot; (1856) in New York City; and Thomas Crawford&#x27;s George Washington in Richmond, Virginia (1858). Mills was the first American sculptor to overcome the challenge of casting a rider on a rearing horse. The resulting sculpture (of Jackson) was so popular he repeated it for New Orleans, Nashville, and Jacksonville.

Cyrus Edwin Dallin made a specialty of equestrian sculptures of American Indians: his &quot;Appeal to the Great Spirit&quot; stands before the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The &quot;Robert Gould Shaw Memorial&quot; in Boston is a well-known relief including an equestrian portrait.

===Twentieth century===
As the twentieth century progressed, the popularity of the equestrian monument declined sharply, as monarchies fell and the military use of horses virtually vanished. The statue of Queen Elizabeth II riding Burmese in Canada, and statues of Rani Lakshmibai in Gwalior and Jhansi, India, are some of the rare portrait statues with female riders. (Although Joan of Arc has been so portrayed a number of times, and an equestrian statue of Queen Victoria features prominently in George Square, Glasgow). In America, the late 1970s and early 1980s witnessed something of a revival in equestrian monuments, largely in the Southwestern United States. There, art centers such as Loveland, Colorado, Shidoni Foundry in New Mexico, and various studios in Texas once again began producing equestrian sculpture.

These revival works fall into two general categories, the memorialization of a particular individual or the portrayal of general figures, notably the American cowboy or Native Americans. Such monuments can be found throughout the American Southwest.

In Glasgow, the sculpture of Lobey Dosser on El Fidelio, erected in tribute to Bud Neill, is claimed to be the only two-legged equestrian statue in the world.

== Tallest and largest equestrian statue ==

The monument to general Jose Gervasio Artigas in Minas, Uruguay (18 meters tall, 9 meters long, 150,000 kg), was the world&#x27;s largest equestrian statue until 2008. The current largest is the 40-meter-tall equestrian statue of Genghis Khan at Boldog, 54 km from Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where, according to legend, Genghis Khan found the golden whip.

The Marjing Polo Statue, standing in the Marjing Polo Complex, Imphal East, Manipur ( tall), completed in 2022–23, is the world&#x27;s tallest equestrian statue of a polo player. It depicts ancient Meitei deity Marjing,a Meitei horse (Manipuri pony) and .

The world&#x27;s largest equestrian sculpture, when completed, will be the Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota, at a planned 641 feet (195 m) wide and 563 feet (172 m) high, even though only the upper torso and head of the rider and front half of the horse will be depicted. Also on a huge scale, the carvings on Stone Mountain in Georgia, the United States, are equestrian sculpture rather than true statues, the largest bas-relief in the world. The world&#x27;s largest equestrian bronze statues are the Juan de Oñate statue (2006) in El Paso, Texas; a 1911 statue in Altare della Patria in Rome; and the statue of Jan Žižka (1950) in Prague.

==Other statues of particular note==

*Memorial at Vlamertinge to commemorate the one million horses killed in WW1
*Memorial of Captain Edward Cheney at Gaddesby showing him on a dying horse – he had five horses shot out from under him at the Battle of Waterloo and led the charge of the Royal Scots Greys – the only equestrian statue in a British church
*Memorial to &quot;Crimean Bob&quot; the last horse to die following service at the Battle of Waterloo, in Cahir
*The Kelpies, pair of 30m high horse heads near Falkirk in Scotland

==Hoof-position symbolism==
In many parts of the world, an urban legend states that if the horse is rearing (both front legs in the air), the rider died in battle; one front leg up means the rider was wounded in battle; and if all four hooves are on the ground, the rider died outside battle. A rider depicted as dismounted and standing next to their horse often indicates that both were killed during battle. For example, Richard the Lionheart is memorialised, mounted passant, outside the Palace of Westminster by Carlo Marochetti; the former died 11 days after his wound, sustained in siege, turned septic. A survey of 15 equestrian statues in central London by the Londonist website found that nine of them corresponded to the supposed rule, and considered it &quot;not a reliable system for reading the fate of any particular rider&quot;.

In the United States, the rule is especially held to apply to equestrian statues commemorating the American Civil War and the Battle of Gettysburg. One such statue was erected in 1998 in Gettysburg National Military Park, and is of James Longstreet, who is featured on his horse with one foot raised, even though Longstreet was not wounded in that battle. However, he was seriously wounded in the Battle of the Wilderness the following year. This is not a traditional statue, as it does not place him on a pedestal. One writer claims that any correlation between the positioning of hooves in a statue and the manner in which a Gettysburg soldier died is a coincidence. There is no proper evidence that these hoof positions correlate consistently with the rider&#x27;s history but some hold to the belief regardless.

<text>Times Beach is a ghost town in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States, southwest of St. Louis and east of Eureka. Once home to more than two thousand people, the town was completely evacuated in early 1983 due to TCDD (a type of dioxin) contamination, formerly the largest civilian exposure to the compound in the history of the United States.

In 1985, the State of Missouri officially disincorporated the city of Times Beach. The site of Times Beach now houses a state park which opened in 1999. The park commemorates U.S. Route 66, as well as the history of the Times Beach area. The famous U.S. Route 66 highway that stretches from Chicago, Illinois, to Santa Monica, California passed though the community on its southern end. In 2001, the EPA removed Times Beach from its Superfund list.

==History==
Times Beach was founded in 1925 on the flood plain of the Meramec River, southwest of the river, in a promotion by the now-defunct &quot;St. Louis Star-Times&quot; newspaper. A purchase of a 20 × 100 ft (6 by 30 m) lot for $67.50 included a six-month newspaper subscription.

In its early years, the town was primarily a summer resort, but the Great Depression combined with gasoline rationing during World War II reduced the feasibility of summer homes. The town became a community of mostly low-income housing, and a small population (1,240) lived in Times Beach by 1970. In the years immediately before its evacuation, Times Beach had become a lower-middle-class town. Historically, there had always been a small grocery store and gas station on Route 66 to serve the residents.

Prone to flooding throughout its history—its first buildings were built on stilts—the town experienced a devastating flood in December 1982. It happened just as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was confirming that dioxin contaminated the soil, leading to the town&#x27;s evacuation by 1985 and complete demolition by 1992. The town was disincorporated by executive order of Missouri governor John Ashcroft on April 2, 1985.

The story of Times Beach was featured on History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Modern Marvels&quot;, in the episode &quot;Engineering Disasters 20&quot;.

==Dioxin contamination==

===Events leading up to the crisis===

====NEPACCO chemical waste disposal====
During the late 1960s, the Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical Company, Inc. (NEPACCO) began operating out of a facility located near Verona, in southwestern Missouri. This facility was owned by Hoffman-Taff, a company that produced the Agent Orange herbicide for use during the Vietnam War. By the time NEPACCO ceased its operations in 1972, Hoffman-Taff had been taken over by Syntex Agribusiness.

From 1970 to 1972, NEPACCO was primarily involved in the production of hexachlorophene (3), an antibacterial agent used in soap, toothpaste, and common household disinfectants, from 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (1) and formaldehyde (2).
2,4,5-trichlorophenol is synthesized from 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene by the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Unfortunately, instantaneous dimerization of the resulting phenol produces trace amounts of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an extremely toxic compound known to have both acute and chronic adverse effects.
Beginning the process of production with 2,4,5-trichlorophenol that contained 3–5 parts per million (ppm) of dioxin, NEPACCO was able to reduce the concentration of dioxin in hexachlorophene to 0.1 ppm. The result of this purification process led to the storage and accumulation of heavily concentrated dioxin still bottoms, or thick, oily residues, in a storage tank located near the facility in Verona. When NEPACCO first began operations, the still bottoms were sent to a waste facility in Louisiana for incineration. Although incineration was the best method to destroy dioxins at the time, it was also very expensive. Looking for less costly alternatives, NEPACCO contracted the services of the Independent Petrochemical Corporation (IPC). However, IPC, a chemical supplier company, knew very little about waste disposal, and subcontracted the NEPACCO job to Russell Martin Bliss, the owner of a small, local waste oil business. Charging NEPACCO $3000 per load, IPC paid Bliss $125 per load.

Between February and October 1971, Bliss collected six truckloads (nearly 18,500 gallons) of chemical waste heavily contaminated with dioxin. Bliss took most of the still bottoms to his storage facility near Frontenac, Missouri, where the contaminated NEPACCO waste was unloaded and mixed into tanks containing used motor oils. Subsequently, some of the contaminated oil was sold to MT Richards, a fuel company in Illinois, and to the Midwest Oil Refining Company in Overland, Missouri.

====First cases of contamination====
In addition to his waste oil business, Bliss owned a horse arena and farm, where he sprayed waste oils to control nuisance dust. One application controlled the dust for several months. Those who visited Bliss&#x27; property were impressed by how well the technique worked. It was not long before people began to hire him for his dust-suppressant services.

On May 26, 1971, the owners of Shenandoah Stable, located near Moscow Mills, Missouri, Judy Piatt and Frank Hampel, paid Bliss $150 to spray the floor of their indoor arena. The waste oil sprayed, which totaled a volume of 2,000 gallons, was uncharacteristically thick, and left a pungent, burning odor. Within a few days of the spraying, birds began to drop dead from the rafters of the barns, and horses began to develop sores and lose their hair. Piatt and Hampel blamed these occurrences on Bliss, who denied responsibility, claiming that the material he sprayed was nothing more than old motor oil.

Acting on their suspicions, Piatt and Hampel removed the top six inches of soil from the entire arena and disposed of it in a landfill. Despite the removal of another 12 inches of soil a few months later, horses that came to the arena became ill. After several months, 62 horses died or became so emaciated that they had to be euthanized. Hampel, Piatt, and Piatt&#x27;s two young daughters also became ill, developing headaches, nosebleeds, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

A month after the spraying at Shenandoah, Bliss was hired to spray the arena at Timberline Stables, near Jefferson City, Missouri. Twelve horses died, and children exposed to the arena were diagnosed with chloracne, a skin condition associated with dioxin poisoning. Suspecting that Bliss&#x27; oil was the source of their problems, the owners of Timberline removed the top layer of soil from their property.

A third arena, at Bubbling Springs Ranch, near St. Louis, was also sprayed around the same time as Timberline and faced similar problems. As at Shenandoah and Timberline, the owners decided to remove the top layer of soil from their arena. Vernon Stout, a road-grading contractor, completed the removal in March 1973. Instead of bringing the soil to a landfill, Stout unloaded the soil onto one of his properties and at the nearby home of Harold Minker.

====CDC investigations====
The unexplained deaths and illnesses at Shenandoah immediately caught the attention of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In August 1971, the CDC completed an inspection of Shenandoah Stable, and collected human and animal blood samples, as well as soil samples. Although initial results revealed that the soil at Shenandoah Stable contained PCBs and chlorinated insecticides, the CDC was unable to identify a specific chemical culprit. It was not until 1973 that tests revealed the presence of trichlorophenol. When trace amounts of the crude trichlorophenol contaminant were administered to the inner surfaces of rabbit ears, blisters developed, which was a characteristic result of trichlorophenol poisoning. The unexpected death of some of the affected rabbits however, led the CDC to run more complex tests.

On July 30, 1974, the CDC found that, in addition to 5,000 ppm of trichlorophenol and 1,590 ppm of PCBs, the soil samples collected from Shenandoah contained over 30 ppm of dioxin. Although little was known about the effects of dioxin on humans, the lethality of small doses in animals was alarming. As a result, the CDC immediately set out to locate other possible sites of contamination. When confronted by the CDC, Bliss stated that he did not know where the dioxin could have come from.

Because dioxin was a by-product of only a handful of chemicals, trichlorophenol being the most common, the CDC narrowed their search to companies in Missouri using or producing trichlorophenol. NEPACCO was the only company on the search list that had come into contact with Bliss.

NEPACCO went out of business in 1972, after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had issued a ban that limited the use of hexachlorophene. The ban was motivated by the death of thirty-two infants in France who were exposed to high levels of hexachlorophene in baby powder. During an inspection of the old NEPACCO facility in Verona, which was now entirely owned by Syntex Agribusiness, the CDC discovered an old tank filled with 4,300 gallons of NEPACCO still bottoms at a dioxin concentration of more than 340 ppm. Due to a lack of incinerators in proximity to the Verona plant, the proper disposal of the leftover still bottoms would not be completed until 1979.

With further investigation of contaminated locations, the CDC advised residents of the Minker and Stout properties to minimize contact with the soil. Soil samples had revealed a dioxin concentration of 0.85 ppm at Minker&#x27;s property, and a concentration of 0.44 ppm at Stout&#x27;s property. In a 1975 confidential report to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the CDC also further advised the removal and burial of contaminated soil from both properties. In the same document, however, the CDC reported that the half-life of dioxin was one year. Based on this estimate, which was later found to be incorrect, Missouri officials decided to forgo the recommended cleanup. Today, the half-life of dioxin is estimated to be seven to eleven years.

====Involvement of the EPA====
The EPA did not become heavily involved with the Missouri dioxin contaminations until 1979 when a former NEPACCO employee reported the burial of toxic waste on a farm located about seven miles from Verona. NEPACCO had paid James Denney, the owner of the farm, $150 for the use of his property. Under the investigations of the EPA, a total of 90 drums, all of which were corroded and leaky, were unearthed. Eleven of these drums contained still bottoms with dioxin concentrations as high as 2,000 ppm.

In May and June 1982, the EPA decided to revisit the Shenandoah, Timberline, and Bubbling Springs stables, as well as the Minker and Stout properties. New soil samples revealed that concentrations of dioxin had not decreased since the last test results obtained by the CDC several years earlier. Although eleven years had passed since the spraying, areas in the Shenandoah arena still contained as much as 1.8 ppm of dioxin. Regional EPA officials advised owners of the contaminated stables to temporarily close and urged the national EPA office to begin cleanup operations at each of the contaminated locations. These cleanup requests were delayed when Rita Lavelle, an assistant administrator at EPA headquarters in Washington, announced that the EPA would be collecting and testing an additional 600 soil samples in order to better understand the extent of contamination.

The EPA&#x27;s handling of the events in Missouri caught national attention in late 1982 when the Environmental Defense Fund, a public interest group, published a leaked EPA document that listed a total of 14 confirmed and 41 possibly contaminated sites in the state of Missouri. The town of Times Beach was one of the locations listed. The Environmental Defense Fund also claimed that the EPA had decided to lower dioxin cleanup protocol standards. Although the CDC advised for cleanups in locations where dioxin levels were as low as 0.001 ppm, the Environmental Defense Fund report suggested that new EPA protocols would only necessitate clean up in locations where dioxin concentrations were above 0.1 ppm.

===Crisis at Times Beach===

====Double disaster====
In 1972, Times Beach hired Bliss to oil its 23 miles of dirt roads (due to lack of funding, Times Beach was unable to pave its roads). For $2,400, Bliss sprayed approximately 160,000 gallons of waste oil in Times Beach over a period of four years. The release of the leaked EPA document in 1982 was the first time that Times Beach had learned of its contamination. Residents felt betrayed and publicly criticized the EPA for not informing them of the toxic hazards around their homes. Since Times Beach had the largest population out of the listed sites, Times Beach became the subject of national media and attention.

With pressure from the public, the EPA soon began investigation in Times Beach. Soil sampling was fortuitously completed on December 3, 1982, a day before Times Beach suffered its worst flood in history when the Meramec River breached its banks and rose over 14 feet above flood stage. The residents of Times Beach were evacuated, and by the time the waters began to recede, the EPA had concluded its analysis. Results revealed dioxin concentrations as high as 0.3 ppm along the town&#x27;s entire network of roads.

====Buyout and cleanup efforts====
On December 23, 1982, the CDC publicly recommended that Times Beach not be re-inhabited. Officials were uncertain about the health effects of extensive dioxin exposure and even more uncertain of how to rid an entire town of dioxin. Because the town was situated on a flood plain, officials were further concerned that subsequent flooding would spread the contamination beyond control.

Discussions of a federal buyout commenced on January 7, 1983, when President Ronald Reagan created the Times Beach Dioxin Task Force, which consisted of representatives from the EPA, CDC, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and Army Corps of Engineers. During a press conference on February 22, 1983, the EPA announced that the federal government would pay $33.0 million of the estimated $36.7 million cost to buy out the 800 residential properties and 30 businesses of Times Beach. The remaining $3.7 million would be the responsibility of the state.

By 1985, Times Beach&#x27;s entire population of well over 2,000 residents had been relocated, and Governor John Ashcroft had issued an executive order for the town&#x27;s dis-incorporation.

Since it contained over 50 percent of the dioxin in the state of Missouri and because it was no longer inhabited, Times Beach was the logical choice for the placement of a new incinerator. The construction of the incinerator began in June 1995. Once built, it burned more than 265,000 tons of dioxin-contaminated materials from across the state. The cleanup of Missouri was completed in 1997 and had cost close to $200 million.

===Legal action and responsibility===
In response to the events that transpired in Missouri during the 1970s, a number of laws were passed to regulate the generation and disposal of potentially hazardous products. In 1976, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act, which required the testing of chemicals that could pose an unreasonable risk to the environment. In 1976, Congress also passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which regulated the transportation and disposal of hazardous waste. In 1980, the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) established a multibillion-dollar Superfund to investigate and clean up old, abandoned hazardous waste sites.

The passage of CERCLA also defined the liability of a company and ensured that parties responsible for the release of toxic substances are held liable in the case of environmental damage or harm. In 1983, the federal government sued NEPACCO and its officers, Edwin Michaels and John W. Lee, in &quot;United States v. Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical Co.&quot;. Under the provisions of CERCLA, NEPACCO was forced to repay the federal government for its cleanup efforts at the farm of James Denney, the site where NEPACCO had buried ninety drums of its chemical waste over a decade earlier.

Because the RCRA was not implemented until 1976, Bliss was not legally required to keep records of the chemical wastes he had collected from NEPACCO. During investigations surrounding the dioxin contamination in Missouri, Bliss maintained that he had no knowledge of the presence of dioxin in the chemical waste he collected from NEPACCO. Still, Bliss was the object of many legal pursuits. Over 14,000 citizens&#x27; suits were filed against NEPACCO and its officers, Syntex Agribusiness, IPC, and Bliss. Among these were the cases of Piatt and Hample, who in 1976 settled their suit against Bliss for $10,000 and against IPC for $100,000. In 1981, Piatt and Hample also settled for $65,000 from NEPACCO. IPC paid $1 million to each of Piatt&#x27;s daughters in 1983.

===Consequences of the contamination===
Although the decision for relocation in 1982 was made in the best interests and safety of the Times Beach residents, the evacuation was not an easy transition. Eight hundred families had to leave their lives completely behind. Initially, parents worried about what to do and where to go for financial assistance. As they began to settle into their new lives, their logistical and financial worries were soon replaced by the fear that their children would be afflicted by sudden chronic illnesses. The psychological trauma caused by relocation was immeasurable.
The land that was once Times Beach is now Route 66 State Park. One building from the town still exists: the park&#x27;s visitor center was once a roadhouse from Times Beach&#x27;s glory days and was the EPA&#x27;s headquarters for the area. There is a large grass mound beneath which is the debris of the demolished buildings of the former town. The EPA revisited and tested the soil at the Route 66 State Park in June 2012. On November 19, 2012, it was reported that &quot;Soil samples from Route 66 State Park show no significant health risks for park visitors or workers&quot;.

===Controversy===
Several months after the evacuation, the American Medical Association (AMA) publicly criticized the news media for spreading unscientific information about dioxin and the health hazards associated with it. The AMA stated that there was no evidence of adverse consequences from low-level dioxin exposure. Subsequent studies of potentially exposed people from Times Beach and some other contaminated locations in Missouri have revealed no adverse health outcomes that can be directly linked to dioxin. In a study conducted by the CDC and the Missouri Division of Health, no cases of chloracne, a common symptom of acute dioxin poisoning, were observed in Times Beach residents.

By May 1991, Vernon Houk, the director of the CDC&#x27;s Center for Environmental Health, had come to the same conclusion as the AMA. Although he had made the official recommendation to permanently relocate Times Beach residents in 1982, by 1991, he no longer believed that evacuation had been necessary.

<text>New media are communication technologies that enable or enhance interaction between users as well as interaction between users and content. In the middle of the 1990s, the phrase &quot;new media&quot; became widely used as part of a sales pitch for the influx of interactive CD-ROMs for entertainment and education. The new media technologies, sometimes known as Web 2.0, include a wide range of web-related communication tools such as blogs, wikis, online social networking, virtual worlds, and other social media platforms.

The phrase &quot;new media&quot; refers to computational media that share material online and through computers. New media inspire new ways of thinking about older media. Media do not replace one another in a clear, linear succession, instead evolving in a more complicated network of interconnected feedback loops . What is different about new media is how they specifically refashion traditional media and how older media refashion themselves to meet the challenges of new media.

Unless they contain technologies that enable digital generative or interactive processes, broadcast television programs, feature films, magazines, and books are not considered to be new media.

==History==
In the 1950s, connections between computing and radical art began to grow stronger. It was not until the 1980s that Alan Kay and his co-workers at Xerox PARC began to give the computability of a personal computer to the individual, rather than have a big organization be in charge of this. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, we seem to witness a different kind of parallel relationship between social changes and computer design. Although causally unrelated, conceptually, it makes sense that the Cold War and the design of the Web took place at exactly the same time.

Writers and philosophers such as Marshall McLuhan were instrumental in the development of media theory during this period which is now famous declaration in &quot;Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man,&quot; that &quot;the medium is the message&quot; drew attention to the too often ignored influence media and technology themselves, rather than their &quot;content,&quot; have on humans&#x27; experience of the world and on society broadly.

Until the 1980s, media relied primarily upon print and analog broadcast models such as television and radio. The last twenty-five years have seen the rapid transformation into media which are predicated upon the use of digital technologies such as the Internet and video games. However, these examples are only a small representation of new media. The use of digital computers has transformed the remaining &#x27;old&#x27; media, as suggested by the advent of digital television and online publications. Even traditional media forms such as the printing press have been transformed through the application of technologies by using of image manipulation software like Adobe Photoshop and desktop publishing tools.

Andrew L. Shapiro argues that the &quot;emergence of new, digital technologies signals a potentially radical shift of who is in control of information, experience and resources&quot;. W. Russell Neuman suggests that whilst the &quot;new media&quot; have technical capabilities to pull in one direction, economic and social forces pull back in the opposite direction. According to Neuman, &quot;We are witnessing the evolution of a universal interconnected network of audio, video, and electronic text communications that will blur the distinction between interpersonal and mass communication; and between public and private communication&quot;. Neuman argues that new media will:

*Alter the meaning of geographic distance.
*Allow for a huge increase in the volume of communication.
*Provide the possibility of increasing the speed of communication.
*Provide opportunities for interactive communication.
*Allow forms of communication that were previously separate to overlap and interconnect.

Consequently, it has been the contention of scholars such as Douglas Kellner and James Bohman that new media and particularly the Internet will provide the potential for a democratic postmodern public sphere, in which citizens can participate in well informed, non-hierarchical debate pertaining to their social structures. Contradicting these positive appraisals of the potential social impacts of new media are scholars such as Edward S. Herman and Robert McChesney who have suggested that the transition to new media has seen a handful of powerful transnational telecommunications corporations who achieve a level of global influence which was hitherto unimaginable.

Scholars have highlighted both the positive and negative potential and actual implications of new media technologies, suggesting that some of the early work into new media studies was guilty of technological determinismwhereby the effects of media were determined by the technology themselves, rather than through tracing the complex social networks which governed the development, funding, implementation and future development of any technology.

Based on the argument that people have a limited amount of time to spend on the consumption of different media, displacement theory argue that the viewership or readership of one particular outlet leads to the reduction in the amount of time spent by the individual on another. The introduction of new media, such as the internet, therefore reduces the amount of time individuals would spend on existing &quot;old&quot; media, which could ultimately lead to the end of such traditional media.

==Definition==
Although, there are several ways that new media may be described, Lev Manovich, in an introduction to &quot;The New Media Reader&quot;, defines new media by using eight propositions:

#New media versus cybercultureCyberculture is the various social phenomena that are associated with the Internet and network communications (blogs, online multi-player gaming), whereas new media is concerned more with cultural objects and paradigms (digital to analog television, smartphones).
#New media as computer technology used as a distribution platformNew media are the cultural objects which use digital computer technology for distribution and exhibition. e.g. (at least for now) Internet, Web sites, computer multimedia, Blu-ray disks etc. The problem with this is that the definition must be revised every few years. The term &quot;new media&quot; will not be &quot;new&quot; anymore, as most forms of culture will be distributed through computers.
#New media as digital data controlled by softwareThe language of new media is based on the assumption that, in fact, all cultural objects that rely on digital representation and computer-based delivery do share a number of common qualities. New media is reduced to digital data that can be manipulated by software as any other data. Now media operations can create several versions of the same object. An example is an image stored as matrix data which can be manipulated and altered according to the additional algorithms implemented, such as color inversion, gray-scaling, sharpening, rasterizing, etc.
#New media as the mix between existing cultural conventions and the conventions of softwareNew media today can be understood as the mix between older cultural conventions for data representation, access, and manipulation and newer conventions of data representation, access, and manipulation. The &quot;old&quot; data are representations of visual reality and human experience, and the &quot;new&quot; data is numerical data. The computer is kept out of the key &quot;creative&quot; decisions, and is delegated to the position of a technician. e.g. In film, software is used in some areas of production, in others are created using computer animation.
#New media as the aesthetics that accompanies the early stage of every new modern media and communication technologyWhile ideological tropes indeed seem to be reappearing rather regularly, many aesthetic strategies may reappear two or three times ... In order for this approach to be truly useful it would be insufficient to simply name the strategies and tropes and to record the moments of their appearance; instead, we would have to develop a much more comprehensive analysis which would correlate the history of technology with social, political, and economical histories or the modern period.
#New media as faster execution of algorithms previously executed manually or through other technologiesComputers are a huge speed-up of what were previously manual techniques. e.g. calculators. Dramatically speeding up the execution makes possible previously non-existent representational technique. This also makes possible of many new forms of media art such as interactive multimedia and video games. On one level, a modern digital computer is just a faster calculator, we should not ignore its other identity: that of a cybernetic control device.
#New media as the encoding of modernist avant-garde; new media as metamediaManovich declares that the 1920s are more relevant to new media than any other time period. Metamedia coincides with postmodernism in that they both rework old work rather than create new work. New media avant-garde is about new ways of accessing and manipulating information (e.g. hypermedia, databases, search engines, etc.). Meta-media is an example of how quantity can change into quality as in new media technology and manipulation techniques can recode modernist aesthetics into a very different postmodern aesthetics.
#New media as parallel articulation of similar ideas in post–World War II art and modern computingPost-WWII art or &quot;combinatorics&quot; involves creating images by systematically changing a single parameter. This leads to the creation of remarkably similar images and spatial structures. This illustrates that algorithms, this essential part of new media, do not depend on technology, but can be executed by humans.

==Globalization==
The rise of new media has increased communication between people all over the world and the Internet. It has allowed people to express themselves through blogs, websites, videos, pictures, and other user-generated media.

Terry Flew stated that as new technologies develop, the world becomes more globalized. Globalization is more than the development of activities throughout the world, globalization allows the world to be connected no matter the distance from user to user and Frances Cairncross expresses this great development as the &quot;death of distance&quot;. New media has established the importance of making friendships through digital social places more prominent than in physical places. Globalization is generally stated as &quot;more than expansion of activities beyond the boundaries of particular nation states&quot;. New media &quot;radically break the connection between physical place and social place, making physical location much less significant for our social relationships&quot;.

However, the changes in the new media environment create a series of tensions in the concept of &quot;public sphere&quot;. According to Ingrid Volkmer, &quot;public sphere&quot; is defined as a process through which public communication becomes restructured and partly disembedded from national political and cultural institutions. This trend of the globalized public sphere is not only as a geographical expansion form a nation to worldwide, but also changes the relationship between the public, the media and state.

&quot;Virtual communities&quot; are being established online and transcend geographical boundaries, eliminating social restrictions. Howard Rheingold describes these globalized societies as self-defined networks, which resemble what we do in real life. &quot;People in virtual communities use words on screens to exchange pleasantries and argue, engage in intellectual discourse, conduct commerce, make plans, brainstorm, gossip, feud, fall in love, create a little high art and a lot of idle talk&quot;. For Sherry Turkle &quot;making the computer into a second self, finding a soul in the machine, can substitute for human relationships&quot;. New media has the ability to connect like-minded others worldwide.

While this perspective suggests that the technology drivesand therefore is a determining factorin the process of globalization, arguments involving technological determinism are generally frowned upon by mainstream media studies. Instead academics focus on the multiplicity of processes by which technology is funded, researched and produced, forming a feedback loop when the technologies are used and often transformed by their users, which then feeds into the process of guiding their future development.

While commentators such as Manuel Castells espouse a &quot;soft determinism&quot; whereby they contend that &quot;Technology does not determine society. Nor does society script the course of technological change, since many factors, including individual inventiveness and entrepreneurialism, intervene in the process of scientific discovery, technical innovation and social applications, so the final outcome depends on a complex pattern of interaction. Indeed the dilemma of technological determinism is probably a false problem, since technology is society and society cannot be understood without its technological tools&quot;. This, however, is still distinct from stating that societal changes are instigated by technological development, which recalls the theses of Marshall McLuhan.

Manovich and Castells have argued that whereas mass media &quot;corresponded to the logic of industrial mass society, which values conformity over individuality,&quot; new media follows the logic of the postindustrial or globalized society whereby &quot;every citizen can construct her own custom lifestyle and select her ideology from a large number of choices. Rather than pushing the same objects to a mass audience, marketing now tries to target each individual separately&quot;.

The evolution of virtual communities highlighted many aspects of the real world. Tom Boellstorff&#x27;s studies of Second Life discuss a term known as &quot;griefing.&quot; In Second Life griefing means to consciously upset another user during their experience of the game. Other users also posed situations of their avatar being raped and sexually harassed. In the real world, these same types of actions are carried out. Virtual communities are a clear demonstration of new media through means of new technological developments.

Anthropologist Daniel Miller and sociologist Don Slater discussed online Trinidad culture on online networks through the use of ethnographic studies. The study argues that internet culture does exist and this version of new media cannot eliminate people&#x27;s relations to their geographic area or national identity. The focus on Trini culture specifically demonstrated the importance of what Trini values and beliefs existed within the page while also representing their identities on the web.

==As tool for social change==
Social movement media has a rich and storied history (see Agitprop) that has changed at a rapid rate since new media became widely used. The Zapatista Army of National Liberation of Chiapas, Mexico were the first major movement to make widely recognized and effective use of new media for communiques and organizing in 1994. Since then, new media has been used extensively by social movements to educate, organize, share cultural products of movements, communicate, coalition build, and more. The WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity was another landmark in the use of new media as a tool for social change. The WTO protests used media to organize the original action, communicate with and educate participants, and was used as an alternative media source. The Indymedia movement also developed out of this action, and has been a great tool in the democratization of information, which is another widely discussed aspect of new media movement. Some scholars even view this democratization as an indication of the creation of a &quot;radical, socio-technical paradigm to challenge the dominant, neoliberal and technologically determinist model of information and communication technologies.&quot; A less radical view along these same lines is that people are taking advantage of the Internet to produce a grassroots globalization, one that is anti-neoliberal and centered on people rather than the flow of capital. Chanelle Adams, a feminist blogger for the Bi-Weekly webpaper The Media says that in her &quot;commitment to anti-oppressive feminist work, it seems obligatory for her to stay in the know just to remain relevant to the struggle.&quot; In order for Adams and other feminists who work towards spreading their messages to the public, new media becomes crucial towards completing this task, allowing people to access a movement&#x27;s information instantaneously.

Some are also skeptical of the role of new media in social movements. Many scholars point out unequal access to new media as a hindrance to broad-based movements, sometimes even oppressing some within a movement. Others are skeptical about how democratic or useful it really is for social movements, even for those with access.

New media has also found a use with less radical social movements such as the Free Hugs Campaign. Using websites, blogs, and online videos to demonstrate the effectiveness of the movement itself. Along with this example the use of high volume blogs has allowed numerous views and practices to be more widespread and gain more public attention. Another example is the ongoing Free Tibet Campaign, which has been seen on numerous websites as well as having a slight tie-in with the band Gorillaz in their Gorillaz Bitez clip featuring the lead singer 2D sitting with protesters at a Free Tibet protest. Another social change seen coming from New Media is trends in fashion and the emergence of subcultures such as textspeak, Cyberpunk, and various others.

Following trends in fashion and textspeak, New Media also makes way for &quot;trendy&quot; social change. The Ice Bucket Challenge is a recent example of this. All in the name of raising money for ALS (the lethal neurodegenerative disorder also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease), participants are nominated by friends via social media such as Facebook and Twitter to dump a bucket of ice water on themselves, or donate to the ALS Foundation. This became a huge trend through Facebook&#x27;s tagging tool, allowing nominees to be tagged in the post. The videos appeared on more people&#x27;s feeds, and the trend spread fast. This trend raised over 100 million dollars for the cause and increased donations by 3,500 percent.

A meme, often seen on the internet, is an idea that has been replicated and passed along. Ryan Milner compared this concept to a possible tool for social change. The combination of pictures and texts represent pop polyvocality (&quot;the people&#x27;s version&quot;). A meme can make more serious conversations less tense while still displaying the situation at sake.

==In the music industry==

The music industry was affected by the advancement of new media. Throughout years of technology growth, the music industry faced major changes such as the distribution of music from shellac to vinyl, vinyl to 8-tracks, and many more changes over the decades. Beginning in the early 1900s, audio was released on a brittle material called &quot;shellac.&quot; The quality of the sound was very distorted and the delicacy of the physical format resulted in the change to LPs (Long Playing). The first LP was made by Columbia Records in 1948 and later on, RCA developed the EP (Extended Play) which was only seven inches around and had a longer playing time in comparison to the original LP. The desire for portable music still persisted in this era which projected the launch of the compact cassette. The Cassette was released in 1963 and flourished after post-war where Cassette tapes were being converted into cars for entertainment when traveling. Not long after the development of the cassette did the music industry begin to see forms of piracy. Cassette tapes allowed people to make their own tapes without paying for rights to the music. This effect caused a major loss in the music industry but it also led to the evolution of mixtapes. As music technologies continued to develop from 8-tracks, floppy discs, CD&#x27;s, and now, MP3, so did new media platforms as well. The discovery of MP3&#x27;s in the 1990s has since changed the world we live in today. At first, MP3 tracks threatened the industry with massive piracy file-to-file sharing networks such as Napster, until laws were established to prevent this. However, consumption of music is higher than ever before due to streaming platforms like Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, and many more!

== National security ==

New media has become of interest to the global espionage community as it is easily accessible electronically in database format and can therefore be quickly retrieved and reverse engineered by national governments. Particularly of interest to the espionage community are Facebook and Twitter, two sites where individuals freely divulge personal information that can then be sifted through and archived for the automatic creation of dossiers on both people of interest and the average citizen.

New media also serves as an important tool for both institutions and nations to promote their interests and values (The contents of such promotion may vary according to different purposes). Some communities consider it an approach of &quot;peaceful evolution&quot; that may erode their own nation&#x27;s system of values and eventually compromise national security.

==Interactivity==
Interactivity has become a term for a number of new media use options evolving from the rapid dissemination of Internet access points, the digitalization of media, and media convergence. In 1984, Ronald E. Rice defined new media as communication technologies that enable or facilitate user-to-user interactivity and interactivity between user and information. Such a definition replaces the &quot;one-to-many&quot; model of traditional mass communication with the possibility of a &quot;many-to-many&quot; web of communication. Any individual with the appropriate technology can now produce his or her online media and include images, text, and sound about whatever he or she chooses. Thus the convergence of new methods of communication with new technologies shifts the model of mass communication, and radically reshapes the ways we interact and communicate with one another. In &quot;What is new media?&quot;, Vin Crosbie described three different kinds of communication media. He saw interpersonal media as &quot;one to one&quot;, mass media as &quot;one to many&quot;, and finally new media as individuation media or &quot;many to many&quot;.

Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It&#x27;s also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid-1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and there is no longer a limit to what we can do with our creativity.

Interactivity can be considered a central concept in understanding new media, but different media forms possess, or enable different degrees of interactivity, and some forms of digitized and converged media are not in fact interactive at all. Tony Feldman considers digital satellite television as an example of a new media technology that uses digital compression to dramatically increase the number of television channels that can be delivered, and which changes the nature of what can be offered through the service, but does not transform the experience of television from the user&#x27;s point of view, and thus lacks a more fully interactive dimension. It remains the case that interactivity is not an inherent characteristic of all new media technologies, unlike digitization and convergence.

Terry Flew argues that &quot;the global interactive games industry is large and growing, and is at the forefront of many of the most significant innovations in new media&quot;. Interactivity is prominent in these online video games such as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;The Sims Online&quot; and &quot;Second Life&quot;. These games, which are developments of &quot;new media,&quot; allow for users to establish relationships and experience a sense of belonging that transcends traditional temporal and spatial boundaries (such as when gamers logging in from different parts of the world interact). These games can be used as an escape or to act out a desired life. New media have created virtual realities that are becoming virtual extensions of the world we live in. With the creation of Second Life and Active Worlds before it, people have even more control over this virtual world, a world where anything that a participant can think of can become a reality.

Interactive games and platforms such as YouTube and Facebook have led to many viral apps that devise a new way to be interacting with media. The development of GIFs, which dates back to the early stages of webpage development has evolved into a social media phenomenon. Miltner and Highfield refer to GIFs as being &quot;polysemic.&quot; These small looping images represent a specific meaning in cultures and often can be used to display more than one meaning. Miltner and Highfield argue that GIFs are particularly useful in creating affective or emotional connections of meaning between people. Affect creates an emotional connection of meaning to the person and their culture.

==Industry==
The new media industry shares an open association with many market segments in areas such as software/video game design, television, radio, mobile and particularly movies, advertising and marketing, through which industry seeks to gain from the advantages of two-way dialogue with consumers primarily through the Internet. As a device to source the ideas, concepts, and intellectual properties of the general public, the television industry has used new media and the Internet to expand its resources for new programming and content. The advertising industry has also capitalized on the proliferation of new media with large agencies running multimillion-dollar interactive advertising subsidiaries. Interactive websites and kiosks have become popular. In a number of cases advertising agencies have also set up new divisions to study new media. Public relations firms are also taking advantage of the opportunities in new media through interactive PR practices. Interactive PR practices include the use of social media to reach a mass audience of online social network users.

With the development of the Internet, many new career paths have emerged. Before the rise, many tech jobs were considered boring. The Internet led to creative work that was seen as casual and diverse across gender, race, and sexual orientation. Web design, gaming design, webcasting, blogging, and animation are all creative career paths that came with this rise. At first glance, the field of new media may seem hip, cool, creative, and relaxed. What many don&#x27;t realize is that working in this field is tiresome. Many of the people that work in this field don&#x27;t have steady jobs. Work in this field has become project-based. Individuals work project to project for different companies. Most people are not working on one project or contract, but on multiple ones at the same time. Despite working on numerous projects, people in this industry receive low payments, which is highly contrasted with the techy millionaire stereotype. It may seem like a carefree life from the outside, but it is not. New media workers work long hours for little pay and spend up to 20 hours a week looking for new projects to work on.

==Youth==

Based on nationally representative data, a study conducted by Kaiser Family Foundation in five-year intervals in 1998–99, 2003–04, and 2008–09 found that with technology allowing nearly 24-hour media access, the amount of time young people spend with entertainment media has risen dramatically, especially among Black and Hispanic youth. Today, 8 to 18-year-olds devote an average of 7 hours and 38 minutes (7:38) to using entertainment media in a typical day (more than 53 hours a week)about the same amount most adults spend at work per day. Since much of that time is spent &#x27;media multitasking&#x27; (using more than one medium at a time), they actually manage to spend a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes worth of media content in those 7½ hours per day. According to the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, 96% of 18 to 29-year-olds and three-quarters (75%) of teens now own a cell phone, 88% of whom text, with 73% of wired American teens using social networking websites, a significant increase from previous years. A survey of over 25000 9- to 16-year-olds from 25 European countries found that many underage children use social media sites despite the site&#x27;s stated age requirements, and many youth lack the digital skills to use social networking sites safely.

The development of the new digital media demands a new educational model by parents and educators. &quot;Parental mediation&quot; has become a way to manage the children&#x27;s experiences with Internet, chat, videogames and social network.

A recent trend in internet is YouTubers Generation. YouTubers are young people who offer free video in their personal channel on YouTube. There are videos on games, fashion, food, cinema and music, where they offers tutorial or comments.

The role of cellular phones, such as the iPhone, has created the inability to be in social isolation, and the potential of ruining relationships. The iPhone activates the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love. People show similar feelings to their phones as they would to their friends, family and loved ones. Countless people spend more time on their phones, while in the presence of other people than spending time with the people in the same room or class.

==Political campaigns in the United States==

In trying to determine the impact of new media on political campaigning and electioneering, the existing research has tried to examine whether new media supplants conventional media. Television is still the dominant news source, but new media&#x27;s reach is growing. What is known is that new media has had a significant impact on elections and what began in the 2008 presidential campaign established new standards for how campaigns would be run. Since then, campaigns also have their outreach methods by developing targeted messages for specific audiences that can be reached via different social media platforms. Both parties have specific digital media strategies designed for voter outreach. Additionally, their websites are socially connected, engaging voters before, during, and after elections. Email and text messages are also regularly sent to supporters encouraging them to donate and get involved.

Some existing research focuses on the ways that political campaigns, parties, and candidates have incorporated new media into their political strategizing. This is often a multi-faceted approach that combines new and old media forms to create highly specialized strategies. This allows them to reach wider audiences, but also to target very specific subsets of the electorate. They are able to tap into polling data and in some cases harness the analytics of the traffic and profiles on various social media outlets to get real-time data about the kinds of engagement that is needed and the kinds of messages that are successful or unsuccessful.

One body of existing research into the impact of new media on elections investigates the relationship between voters&#x27; use of new media and their level of political activity. They focus on areas such as &quot;attentiveness, knowledge, attitudes, orientations, and engagement&quot;. In references a vast body of research, Diana Owen points out that older studies were mixed, while &quot;newer research reveals more consistent evidence of information gain&quot;.

Some of that research has shown that there is a connection between the amount and degree of voter engagement and turnout. However, new media may not have overwhelming effects on either of those. Other research is tending toward the idea that new media has reinforcing effect, that rather than completely altering, by increasing involvement, it &quot;imitates the established pattern of political participation&quot;. After analyzing the Citizenship Involvement Democracy survey, Taewoo Nam found that &quot;the internet plays a dual role in mobilizing political participation by people not normally politically involved, as well as reinforcing existing offline participation.&quot; These findings chart a middle ground between some research that optimistically holds new media up to be an extremely effective or extremely ineffective at fostering political participation.

Terri Towner found, in his survey of college students, that attention to new media increases offline and online political participation particularly for young people. His research shows that the prevalence of online media boosts participation and engagement. His work suggests that &quot;it seems that online sources that facilitate political involvement, communication, and mobilization, particularly campaign websites, social media, and blogs, are the most important for offline political participation among young people&quot;.

When gauging effects and implications of new media on the political process, one means of doing so is to look at the deliberations that take place in these digital spaces. In citing the work of several researchers, Halpern and Gibbs define deliberation to be &quot;the performance of a set of communicative behaviors that promote thorough discussion. and the notion that in this process of communication the individuals involved weigh carefully the reasons for and against some of the propositions presented by others&quot;.

The work of Daniel Halpern and Jennifer Gibbs &quot;suggest that although social media may not provide a forum for intensive or in-depth policy debate, it nevertheless provides a deliberative space to discuss and encourage political participation, both directly and indirectly&quot;. Their work goes a step beyond that as well though because it shows that some social media sites foster a more robust political debate than do others such as Facebook which includes highly personal and identifiable access to information about users alongside any comments they may post on political topics. This is in contrast to sites like YouTube whose comments are often posted anonymously.

== Ethical issues in new media research ==
Due to the popularity of new media, social media websites (SMWs) like Facebook and Twitter are becoming increasingly popular among researchers. Although SMWs present new opportunities, they also represent challenges for researchers interested in studying social phenomena online, since it can be difficult to determine what are acceptable risks to privacy unique to social media. Some scholars argue that standard Institutional Review Board (IRB) procedures provide little guidance on research protocols relating to social media in particular.

As a consequence, three major approaches to research on social media and relevant concerns scholars should consider before engaging in social media research have been identified.

=== Observational research ===
One of the major issues for observational research is whether a particular project is considered to involve human subjects. A human subject is one that “is defined by federal regulations as a living individual about whom an investigator obtains data through interaction with the individual or identifiable private information”. If access to a social media site is public, information is considered identifiable but not private, and information gathering procedures do not require researchers to interact with the original poster of the information, then this does not meet the requirements for human subjects research. Research may also be exempt if the disclosure of participant responses outside the realm of the published research does not subject the participant to civic or criminal liability, damage the participant&#x27;s reputation, employability or financial standing. Given these criteria, however, researchers still have considerable leeway when conducting observational research on social media. Many profiles on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Twitter are public and researchers are free to use that data for observational research.

Users have the ability to change their privacy settings on most social media websites. Facebook, for example, provides users with the ability to restrict who sees their posts through specific privacy settings. There is also debate about whether requiring users to create a username and password is sufficient to establish whether the data is considered public or private. Historically, Institutional Review Boards considered such websites to be private, although newer websites like YouTube call this practice into question. For example, YouTube only requires the creation of a username and password to post videos and/or view adult content, but anyone is free to view general YouTube videos and these general videos would not be subject to consent requirements for researchers looking to conduct observational studies.

=== Interactive research ===
According to Moreno and colleagues, interactive research occurs when &quot;a researcher wishes to access the [social media website] content that is not publicly available&quot;. Because researchers have limited ways of accessing this data, this could mean that a researcher sends a Facebook user a friend request, or follows a user on Twitter in order to gain access to potentially protected tweets. While it could be argued that such actions would violate a social media user&#x27;s expectation of privacy, other scholars argued that actions like &quot;friending&quot; or &quot;following&quot; an individual on social media constitutes a &quot;loose tie&quot; relationship and therefore not sufficient to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy since individuals often have friends or followers they have never even met.

=== Survey and interview research ===
Because research on social media occurs online, it is difficult for researchers to observe participant reactions to the informed consent process. For example, when collecting information about activities that are potentially illegal, or recruiting participants from stigmatized populations, this lack of physical proximity could potentially negatively impact the informed consent process. Another important consideration regards the confidentiality of information provided by participants. While information provided over the internet might be perceived as lower risk, studies that publish direct quotes from study participants might expose them to the risk of being identified via a Google search.

<text>Osterley ( ) is a London Underground station in Osterley, west London, England. It is on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line, between Hounslow East and Boston Manor stations. The station is on Great West Road (A4), close to the National Trust-owned Osterley Park, in Travelcard Zone 4.

==History==
Osterley station opened on 25 March 1934. A station at Osterley had first opened in 1883 at Osterley &amp; Spring Grove, located about 300m to the east on Thornbury Road. In June 1931, it had been decided to relocate the station to the west, to a site adjacent to the new Great West Road which had opened in 1925. Upon opening, the Osterley &amp; Spring Grove station was closed, although the station building remained.

Designed in the modern European style used elsewhere on the Piccadilly line by Charles Holden, the station was designed by architect Stanley Heaps following a preliminary plan by Holden. The design uses brick, reinforced concrete and large areas of glass. The station also features a brick tower topped with a concrete &quot;obelisk&quot;, possibly inspired by De Telegraaf Building in Amsterdam, which Holden visited as part of a study trip to the Netherlands. The Chief Executive of London Transport Frank Pick felt that stations designed by others that followed Holden&#x27;s style lacked attention to detail – with Pick dubbing them &#x27;Holdenesque&#x27;. The station was awarded listed building status in 1987, at Grade II.
Osterley station was a replacement for an earlier station, &quot;Osterley &amp; Spring Grove&quot;, located about 300m to the east on Thornbury Road, which was closed when Osterley opened. The old station buildings and platforms remain.

The station was served from its opening by trains from the District and Piccadilly lines, although District line services were withdrawn on 9 October 1964.

===Step-free access===
In 2009, because of financial constraints, Transport for London decided to stop work on a project to provide step-free access at Osterley on the grounds that it was a relatively quiet station and within one or two stops of an existing step-free station, Hounslow East where step-free access has been available since 2005.

In 2017, TfL announced that Osterley station would receive funding for step-free access, with work commencing in 2018. In October 2021, Osterley became the 89th step-free Tube station, following completion of works at the station to install two lifts.
==Connections==
*London Buses route H91 serves the station.
*Osterley is the closest tube station to Sky&#x27;s offices near Gillette Corner. Sky runs a private shuttle bus service to and from the station every 15 minutes during extended office hours for visitors and staff.

<doc id="344865" wikidata="Q444159" url="?curid=344865" title="Saturday Night Massacre">
<text>The &quot;Saturday Night Massacre&quot; was a series of resignations over the dismissal of special prosecutor Archibald Cox that took place in the United States Department of Justice during the Watergate scandal in 1973. The events followed the refusal by Cox to drop a subpoena for the Nixon White House tapes at President Richard Nixon&#x27;s request.

During a single evening on Saturday, October 20, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Archibald Cox; Richardson refused and resigned effective immediately. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox; Ruckelshaus refused, and also resigned. Nixon then ordered the third-most-senior official at the Justice Department, Solicitor General Robert Bork, to fire Cox. Bork carried out the dismissal as Nixon asked. Bork stated that he intended to resign afterward, but was persuaded by Richardson and Ruckelshaus to stay on for the good of the Justice Department.

The political and public reactions to Nixon&#x27;s actions were negative and highly damaging to the president. The impeachment process against Nixon began ten days later, on October 30, 1973. Leon Jaworski was appointed as the new special prosecutor on November 1, 1973, and on November 14, 1973, United States District Judge Gerhard Gesell ruled that the dismissal had been illegal. The Saturday Night Massacre marked the turning point of the Watergate scandal as the public, while increasingly uncertain about Nixon&#x27;s actions in Watergate, were incensed by Nixon&#x27;s seemingly blatant attempt to end the Watergate probe, while Congress, having largely taken a wait-and-see policy regarding Nixon&#x27;s role in the scandal, quickly turned on Nixon and initiated impeachment proceedings that would end in Nixon&#x27;s resignation.

==Origin of the phrase==
The actual origin of the phrase is unknown; it first appeared in writing two days after the events, in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article by David S. Broder on October 22, but even in that article, Broder writes that the events were already &quot;being called&quot; the Saturday Night Massacre. In a 2017 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Amy B. Wang attributed the phrase to humorist Art Buchwald, based on the recollection of Sally Quinn.

==History==
U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson had appointed Cox in May 1973 after promising the House Judiciary Committee that he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the events surrounding the break-in of the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s offices at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C., on June 17, 1972. The appointment was created as a career reserved position in the Justice Department, meaning it came under the authority of the attorney general, who could only remove the special prosecutor &quot;for cause&quot;, e.g., gross improprieties or malfeasance in office. Richardson had, in his confirmation hearings before the U.S. Senate, promised not to use his authority to dismiss the Watergate special prosecutor unless for cause.

When Cox issued a subpoena to Nixon, asking for copies of taped conversations recorded in the Oval Office, the president refused to comply. On October 12, 1973, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the subpoena, rejecting Nixon&#x27;s claims of executive privilege. On Friday, October 19, Nixon offered what was later known as the Stennis Compromise – asking the infamously hard-of-hearing Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi to review and summarize the tapes for the special prosecutor&#x27;s office. Cox refused the compromise that same evening, and it was believed that there would be a short rest in the legal maneuvering while government offices were closed for the weekend.

However, on the following day (Saturday), Nixon ordered Attorney General Richardson to fire Cox. Richardson refused and resigned in protest. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox. Ruckelshaus also refused and resigned.

Nixon then ordered the Solicitor General of the United States, Robert Bork, as acting head of the Justice Department, to fire Cox. Both Richardson and Ruckelshaus had given personal assurances to Congressional oversight committees that they would not interfere, but Bork had not. Although Bork later claimed he believed Nixon&#x27;s order to be valid and appropriate, he still considered resigning to avoid being &quot;perceived as a man who did the President&#x27;s bidding to save my job&quot;. Nevertheless, having been brought to the White House by limousine and sworn in as acting attorney general, Bork wrote the letter dismissing Cox.

==Aftermath==
Initially, the Nixon White House claimed to have fired Ruckelshaus, but as an article published the next day by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; pointed out, &quot;The letter from the President to Bork also said Ruckelshaus resigned&quot;, catching Nixon lying.

The night he was fired, Cox&#x27;s deputy prosecutor and press aides held an impassioned news briefing and read the following statement from him, &quot;Whether ours shall continue to be a government of laws and not of men is now for Congress and ultimately the American people [to decide].&quot;

On November 14, 1973, federal district judge Gerhard Gesell ruled firing Cox was illegal absent a finding of extraordinary impropriety as specified in the regulation establishing the special prosecutor&#x27;s office. Congress was infuriated by what it saw as a gross abuse of presidential power – as were many Americans, who sent an unusually large number of telegrams to the White House and Congress in protest.

Less than a week after the Saturday Night Massacre, an Oliver Quayle poll for NBC News indicated that, for the first time, a plurality of U.S. citizens supported impeaching Nixon, with 44% in favor, 43% opposed, and 13% undecided, with a sampling error of 2 to 3 per cent.

==Impact and legacy==

Nixon felt political pressure to allow Bork to appoint a new special prosecutor, and Bork, with Nixon&#x27;s approval, chose Leon Jaworski. There was a question whether Jaworski would limit his investigation to the Watergate break-in or follow Cox&#x27;s lead and look into other corrupt activities, such as those involving the &quot;White House Plumbers&quot;. Continuing Cox&#x27;s investigation, Jaworski did look at broader corruption involving the White House.

While Nixon continued to refuse to turn over the tapes, he agreed to release transcripts of a large number of them. Nixon said he did so partly because any audio pertinent to national security would have to be redacted from the tapes. There was further controversy on November 7 when an 18½-minute portion of one tape was found to have been erased. Nixon&#x27;s personal secretary, Rose Mary Woods, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong foot pedal on her tape player while answering the phone. Later forensic analysis determined that the tape had been erased in several segments – at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.

Nixon&#x27;s presidency succumbed to mounting pressure resulting from the Watergate scandal and its cover-up. Faced with almost certain impeachment and conviction, Nixon resigned.

In his posthumously published memoirs, Bork said Nixon promised him the next seat on the Supreme Court following Bork&#x27;s role in firing Cox. Nixon was unable to carry out that promise, but President Ronald Reagan nominated Bork for the Supreme Court in 1987; his nomination nevertheless failed in the Senate.

The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 was a direct result of the Saturday Night Massacre.

After six senior Justice Department officials resigned following the DOJ order to dismiss all federal charges against New York City mayor Eric Adams, some compared the resignations to the Saturday Night Massacre.

<text>Conrad I (; c. 881 – 23 December 918), called the Younger, was the king of East Francia from 911 to 918. He was the first king not of the Carolingian dynasty, the first to be elected by the nobility and the first to be anointed. He was chosen as the king by the rulers of the East Frankish stem duchies after the death of young King Louis the Child. Ethnically Frankish, prior to this election he had ruled the Duchy of Franconia from 906.

==Early life==
Conrad was the son of duke Conrad of Thuringia (called &quot;the Elder&quot;) and his wife Glismoda, probably related to Ota, wife of the Carolingian emperor Arnulf of Carinthia and mother of Louis the Child. The Conradines, counts in the Franconian Lahngau region, had been loyal supporters of the Carolingians. At the same time, they competed vigorously for predominance in Franconia with the sons of the Babenbergian duke Henry of Franconia at Bamberg Castle. In 906 the two parties battled each other near Fritzlar. Conrad the Elder was killed, as were two of the three Babenberg brothers. King Louis the Child then took the Conradines&#x27; side and the third Babenbergian brother Adalbert was arrested and executed shortly thereafter, despite a promise of safe conduct by the king&#x27;s chancellor, Archbishop Hatto I of Mainz. Conrad then became the undisputed duke of all Franconia. Nevertheless, he failed in his attempts to extend the rule of Conradines over western Lotharingia after the death of his uncle, duke Gebhard.

==Rule==

After the death of Louis the Child, Conrad was elected king of East Francia on 10 November 911 at Forchheim by the rulers of Saxony, Swabia and Bavaria. The dukes prevented the succession to the throne of Louis&#x27; Carolingian relative Charles the Simple, king of West Francia. They chose the Conradine scion, who was maternally related to the late king. Only Conrad&#x27;s rival, Reginar, duke of Lotharingia, refused to give him his allegiance and joined West Francia. 

Exactly because Conrad I was one of the dukes, he found it very hard to establish his authority over them. Duke Henry of Saxony was in rebellion against Conrad I until 915 and the struggle against Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria, cost Conrad I his life. Burchard II, Duke of Swabia, demanded and received more autonomy. Arnulf of Bavaria called on Magyars for assistance in his uprising, and when defeated, fled to Magyar lands. For this he was condemned to death as a traitor, but the powerful duke managed to avoid execution. 

In 913 Conrad I married Cunigunde, widow of Liutpold and sister of the Swabian count Erchanger. They had: Cunigunda and Herman, both born in 913.

In 913 Erchanger revolted against Conrad I, and in 914 he captured Solomon III, Bishop of Constance, who was Conrad’s chief counselor. Erchanger was exiled but still managed to defeat the royal army in a battle near Lake Constance. He was finally arrested for treason in an assembly of nobles at Hohenaltheim in Swabia and on 21 January 917 was executed together with his brother Berthold.

Conrad&#x27;s reign was a continuous and generally unsuccessful struggle to uphold the power of the king against the growing power of the local dukes. His military campaigns against Charles the Simple to regain Lotharingia and the Imperial city of Aachen were failures. Archbishop Ratbod of Trier even became West Frankish chancellor in 913. Conrad&#x27;s realm was also exposed to the continuous raids of the Magyars since the disastrous defeat of the Bavarian forces at the 907 Battle of Pressburg, leading to a considerable decline in his authority. His attempt to mobilize the East Frankish episcopate led by Archbishop Unni of Bremen to his cause at the 916 synod of Hohenaltheim was not enough to compensate other failures. After several clashes, Conrad at least was able to come to terms with duke Henry of Saxony. The restless Swabian dukes Erchanger (executed in 917) and Burchard II were a continuous threat, as was Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria. 

Severely injured at one of his battles with Arnulf, Conrad died on 23 December 918 at his residence in Weilburg Castle. He was buried in Fulda Cathedral.

According to the &quot;Res gestae saxonicae&quot; by the chronicler Widukind of Corvey, Conrad on his deathbed persuaded his younger brother Eberhard of Franconia to offer the royal crown to Henry the Fowler, the duke of Saxony and one of his principal opponents, since he considered Henry to be the only duke capable of holding the kingdom together in the face of internal rivalries among the dukes and the continuous Magyar raids. It was not until May 919 when Eberhard and the other Frankish nobles accepted Conrad&#x27;s advice, and Henry was elected king at the Reichstag of Fritzlar. Kingship now changed from Franks to Saxons, who had suffered greatly during the conquests of Charlemagne and were proud of their identity.

Eberhard succeeded Conrad as duke of Franconia, but was killed in 939 at the Battle of Andernach during his rebellion against emperor Otto I. Hereafter the duchy of Franconia became a direct Imperial possession of the Ottonian dynasty until 1024.

<text>Lublin Voivodeship ( ) is a voivodeship (province) of Poland, located in the southeastern part of the country, with its capital being the city of Lublin.

The region is named after its largest city and regional capital, Lublin, and its territory is made of four historical lands: the western and central part of the voivodeship, with Lublin itself, belongs to Lesser Poland, the eastern part of Lublin Area belongs to Cherven Cities/Red Ruthenia, and the northeast belongs to Polesie and Podlasie.
Lublin Voivodeship borders Subcarpathian Voivodeship to the south, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship to the south-west, Masovian Voivodeship to the west and north, Podlaskie Voivodeship along a short boundary to the north, Belarus (Brest Region) and Ukraine (Lviv and Volyn Regions) to the east. The region&#x27;s population as of 2019 was 2,112,216. It covers an area of .

== History ==

The Polish historical region that encompasses Lublin, and approximates Lublin Voivodeship as it was before the Partitions of Poland, is known as &quot;Lubelszczyzna&quot;. Provinces centred on Lublin have existed throughout much of Poland&#x27;s history; for details see the section below on Previous Lublin Voivodeships. Cities and towns of greatest historic importance are Lublin, Chełm, Kazimierz Dolny and Zamość. Lublin hosted several sessions of the Polish Parliament, including the session which established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (see Union of Lublin), and was the seat of the Crown Tribunal for the Lesser Poland Province, the highest appeal court in the Kingdom of Poland, and Parczew also hosted one session of the Polish Parliament. Horodło was the place of signing of the Polish–Lithuanian Union of Horodło, predating the Union of Lublin.

In the 17th century, there were sizeable Scottish communities in Lublin and Zamość, and also a smaller one in Opole Lubelskie. Lublin and Zamość also hosted Armenian minorities.

The industry of the region was greatly expanded as part of the Central Industrial Region of Poland.
The region was, before World War II, one of the world&#x27;s leading centres of Judaism. Before the middle of the 16th century, there were few Jews in the area, concentrated in Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny, and perhaps Chełm; but the founding of new private towns led to a large movement of Jews into the region to develop trade and services. Since these new towns competed with the existing towns for business, there followed a low-intensity, long-lasting feeling of resentment, with failed attempts to limit the Jewish immigration. The Jews tended to settle mostly in the cities and towns, with only individual families setting up businesses in the rural regions; this urban/rural division became another factor feeding resentment of the newly arrived economic competitors. By the middle of the 18th century, Jews were a significant part of the population in Kraśnik, Lubartów and Łęczna.

By the 20th century, Jews represented greater than 70% of the population in eleven towns and close to 100% of the population of Łaszczów and Izbica. From this region came both religious figures such as Mordechai Josef Leiner of Izbica, Chaim Israel Morgenstern of Puławy, and Motele Rokeach of Biłgoraj, as well as famous secular author Israel Joshua Singer. Israel&#x27;s brother, the Nobel prize winner Isaac Bashevis Singer, was not born in Biłgoraj but lived part of his life in the city. The &quot;Old Town&quot; of the city of Lublin contained a famous yeshiva, Jewish hospital, synagogue, cemetery, and kahal, as well as the Grodzka Gate (known as the Jewish Gate).

Before the war, there were 300,000 Jews living in the region, which became the site of the Majdanek concentration camp, Bełżec extermination camp and Sobibór extermination camp as well as several labour camps (Trawniki, Poniatowa, Budzyn, Puławy, Zamość, Biała Podlaska, and the Lublin work camps Lipowa 7 camp, Flugplatz, and Sportplatz) which produced military supplies for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. This was once one of the biggest forced labour centres in German-occupied Europe, with approximately 45,000 Jewish prisoners. After the war, the few surviving Jews largely left the area; today there is some restoration of areas of Jewish historical interest, and a surge of tourism by Jews seeking to view their families&#x27; historical roots.

Polish people were also victims of German persecution and crimes, including the &quot;AB-Aktion&quot;, &quot;Aktion T4&quot; and Operation Zamość with deportations to Nazi concentration camps, forced labour, kidnapping of children and massacres in the region. It witnessed the Polish Zamość uprising against German occupation. There were also German prisoner-of-war camps for Polish, French, Italian, Dutch, Belgian, Senegalese and Soviet prisoners of war in Chełm, Dęblin, Biała Podlaska, Zamość, Kaliłów with several forced labour subcamps, where many died from starvation, epidemics or were massacred.

Lublin Voivodeship was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former Lublin, Chełm, Zamość, Biała Podlaska and (partially) Tarnobrzeg and Siedlce Voivodeships, pursuant to Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

<text>Need for power (nPow) is a term that was popularized by psychologist David McClelland in 1961. McClelland&#x27;s thinking was influenced by the pioneering work of Henry Murray, who first identified underlying psychological human needs and motivational processes (1938). It was Murray who set out a taxonomy of needs, including needs for achievement, power, and affiliation—and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model. McClelland was inspired by Murray&#x27;s research, and he continued to further develop Murray&#x27;s theory by focusing on this theory in regard to the human population. In McClelland&#x27;s book &quot;The Achieving Society&quot;, nPow helps explain an individual&#x27;s imperative to be in charge. According to his work there are two kinds of power, &quot;social&quot; and &quot;personal&quot;.

==Background==

===Murray&#x27;s system of needs===
Henry Murray was one of the first psychologists to systematically investigate human needs. In his 1938 book, &quot;Explorations in Human Personality&quot;, he identified and labeled twenty needs he believed were universal in nature for all humans. Later research demonstrated that Murray&#x27;s system of needs positively correlates with the Big Five personality traits.

===McClelland&#x27;s three needs theory===
In the 1960s, psychologist David McClelland expanded on Murray&#x27;s work, focusing on the effects of human needs in a work environment. His need theory proposes that most people are consistently motivated by one of three basic desires: the need for affiliation, the need for achievement, or the need for power.

===Thematic apperception test===
To determine how strongly an individual felt each of the three needs, McClelland used the thematic apperception test (TAT), which is designed to uncover a person&#x27;s unconscious drives, emotions, wants and needs. During the test, a psychologist shows an individual a series of picture cards depicting ambiguous situations and asks them to tell a story about each image. The psychologist then interprets those stories to identify desires or personality traits the individual may be unaware of or want to hide. Several empirical studies have demonstrated that the TAT cannot detect mental illness at a rate higher than chance, and the inter-rater validity as measured by Cronbach&#x27;s alpha (the likelihood of two psychologists providing similar interpretations of the same person&#x27;s results) is low, especially if the clinician gives a subjective interpretation instead of using the test&#x27;s original scoring system. However, proponents of the TAT argue that Cronbach&#x27;s alpha is artificially low for tests with a small number of items, and that the TAT provides a more detailed and flexible description of an individual than a structured questionnaire.

==Effects of a high need for power==

McClelland defines the need for power (nPow) as a desire for &quot;power either to control other people (for [one&#x27;s] own goals) or to achieve higher goals (for the greater good),&quot; and describes people high in this trait as seeking &quot;neither recognition nor approval from others - only agreement and compliance.&quot;. In his later research, McClelland refined his theory to include two distinct types of power motivation: the need for &quot;socialized power&quot;, expressed on the TAT by descriptions of plans, self-doubts, mixed outcomes, and concern for others, and the need for &quot;personal power&quot;, expressed by stories in which one individual seeks power and must oppose another to get it. Compared to people who value affiliation or achievement, individuals with high nPow scores tend to be more argumentative, more assertive in group discussions, and more likely to experience frustration when they feel powerless or not in control of a situation. They are more likely to seek or hold a position in which they have control over others, and to engage in conspicuous consumption.

===Pros and cons===

====For individuals====
A high nPow score predicts greater career success for men and for women who report high satisfaction with the power-related aspects of their workplace. McClelland&#x27;s own research included case studies illustrating the advantage of high nPow in the workplace, especially for more experienced workers competing for management positions. In one characteristic example, a successful salesman with a high need for affiliation and a low need for power began to perform poorly after being promoted to management. He experienced difficulty giving direct orders, leading his subordinates to complain that he failed to set clear goals and reward individuals who performed well.

Outside of work, a high nPow score is associated with both positive and negative outcomes, with the result often depending on whether an individual also reports a strong sense of responsibility. When combined with a low score on a measure of responsibility, a high nPow score predicts higher rates of externalizing self-destructive behavior, such as binge-drinking and physical aggression. Men with this combination of personality traits are more likely to divorce, separate, or physically abuse their spouses. However, this association disappears for individuals with average or high responsibility scores, who are disproportionately likely to report positive outcomes like taking on social leadership roles.

====For society====
As with individual outcomes, whether a high need for power results in positive or negative outcomes is influenced by the individual&#x27;s other traits, particularly responsibility and empathy. An argumentative group member may prevent groupthink, or they may intimidate other group members and refuse to make reasonable compromises; a hard-charging manager may motivate and focus their team, or they may bully and manipulate their subordinates. Even dangerous behaviors, like impulsive risk-taking, can be beneficial in moderation: successful stock traders and entrepreneurs often have a high propensity for risk.

===Gender===

On average, men report a higher need for power than women, which may be due to biological factors, social factors, or an interaction between them. Gender also influences how the need for power is outwardly expressed: men are more likely to express anger directly, use physical violence to establish control, or engage in risky or impulsive behavior, while women are more likely to employ relational aggression or suppress their hostility. When the needs for socialized and personal power are measured separately, women managers express a greater desire for socialized power than their male counterparts, but an equal desire for personal power. Men, but not women, reported greater job satisfaction if they had a high need for socialized power.

==Other parts of the theory==

===Need for achievement===

Murray defined need for achievement as the attempt to overcome obstacles. Need for achievement (nAch) was defined by McClelland as the motive to strive for success in particular situations in which his/her performance would be looked at against some type of standard. McClelland used the thematic apperception test in order to test this part of his theory. He would show people four pictures and ask people to write a story regarding these pictures. Based on his/her story, McClelland would be able to determine what type of achievement a person strived.

===Need for affiliation===

Murray believed need for affiliation was a trait that was very strong in most people, especially in stressful situations. Murray believed that when people were put into a stressful situation, people were more likely to feel less stress if another person was present. In McClelland&#x27;s research, he found that people who had need for affiliation were often unpopular tried to avoid interpersonal conflicts because they have levels of anxiety about if others will accept them.

<text>An oath of allegiance is an oath whereby a subject or citizen acknowledges a duty of allegiance and swears loyalty to a monarch or a country. In modern republics, oaths are sworn to the country in general, or to the country&#x27;s constitution. For example, officials in the United States, take an oath of office that includes swearing allegiance to the United States Constitution. However, typically in a constitutional monarchy, such as in the United Kingdom, Australia, and other Commonwealth realms, oaths are sworn to the monarch. Armed forces typically require a military oath.

In feudal times, a person would also swear allegiance to their feudal superiors. To this day the oath sworn by freemen of the City of London contains an oath of obedience to the Lord Mayor of the City of London.

Oaths of allegiance are commonly required of newly naturalised citizens (see oath of citizenship), members of the armed forces, and those assuming public (particularly parliamentary and judicial) offices. Clergy in the Church of England are required to take an Oath of Supremacy acknowledging the authority of the British monarch.

A typical example of an oath of allegiance is that sworn by members of Parliament in the Netherlands:

In many Commonwealth realms, all that is required is an oath to the monarch, and not the constitution or state. There have been moves in some of the realms to make the oath of citizenship sworn by new citizens refer to the country rather than the monarch. However, the oaths sworn by judges, members of parliament, etc., have not been changed. All of these moves have not succeeded as the King or Queen is the personification of the Canadian, British, or Australian state (or that of any other Commonwealth realm). Allegiance sworn to the monarch is the same as to the country, its constitution or flag. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 1999 that the oath of allegiance to a reigning monarch is &quot;reasonably viewed as an affirmation of loyalty to the constitutional principles supporting the workings of representative democracy.&quot;

<text>Quercus ilex, the holm oak, also (ambiguously, as many oaks are evergreen) evergreen oak, is a large evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the section &quot;Ilex&quot; of the genus, with acorns that mature in a single summer.

==Description==
It is a large evergreen tree, attaining in favourable places a height of , and developing in open situations a huge head of densely leafy branches as much across, the terminal portions of the branches often pendulous in old trees. The tallest recorded, a tree planted at Windsor Great Park, is 30.4 m tall. The trunk is sometimes over in girth. The young shoots are clothed with a close grey felt. The leaves are very variable in shape, most frequently narrowly oval or ovate-lanceolate, long (rarely to 10 cm long), 2–5 cm wide (rarely to 8 cm wide), rounded or broadly tapered at the base, pointed, the margins usually entire on mature trees, or (especially on young trees) more or less spiny-toothed. When quite young, both surfaces are clothed with whitish down, which soon falls away entirely from the upper surface leaving it a dark glossy green; on the lower surface it turns grey or tawny, and persists until the fall of the leaf; the petiole is long. The acorns are produced one to three together on a short downy stalk, ripening the first season; they are usually 12–20 mm long in the UK, the cups with adpressed, downy scales, and an often wavy margin.

==Distribution and habitat==
Holm oak grows in pure stands or mixed forest in the Mediterranean and often at low or moderate elevations, but also at higher altitudes in the Atlas Mountains. It is native from westernmost Turkey and through Greece west to parts of the Iberian Peninsula, where it mixes with &quot;Q. rotundifolia&quot;, along the northern Mediterranean coastal belt, and in the Atlas Mountains in Tunisia and Algeria.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Quercus ilex&quot; is placed in section &quot;Ilex&quot;.

The closely related species &quot;Quercus rotundifolia&quot; was previously thought to be a subspecies of &quot;Q. ilex&quot;, but is now more often treated as a separate species. Some authors still describe &quot;Quercus rotundifolia&quot; as a subspecies of &quot;Quercus ilex&quot;.

==Etymology==
The resemblance of the foliage to that of the common European holly, &quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot;, has led to its common and botanic names. The species name &quot;&quot; was originally the classical Latin name for the holm oak, but later adopted as a botanical genus name for the hollies. The common name &#x27;holm oak&#x27; takes its name from , an ancient name for holly.

==Cultivation and uses==
The wood is hard and tough, and has been used since ancient times for general construction purposes as pillars, tools, wagons (as mentioned in Hesiod, &quot;Works and Days&quot; on page 429), vessels and wine casks. It is also used as firewood and in charcoal manufacture.

The holm oak is one of the top three trees used in the establishment of truffle orchards, or truffières. Truffles grow in an ectomycorrhizal association with the tree&#x27;s roots.

The first trees to be grown from acorns in England are still to be found within the stately grounds of Mamhead Park, Devon. From Britton &amp; Brayley in &quot;The Beauties of England and Wales&quot; (1803):The woods and plantations of Mamhead are numerous and extensive. Many of them were introduced by Mr Thomas Balle (sic), the last of that family who, on returning from the continent, brought with him a quantity of cork, ilex, wainscot, oak; Spanish chestnut, acacia, and other species of exotic trees.

Holm oak is not officially listed as an invasive species in the United Kingdom but is naturalised, able to naturally regenerate. Normally the tree is unable to withstand severe frost, which would prevent it from spreading north, but with climate change, it has successfully penetrated and established itself in areas north of its native range. The largest population of holm oak in Northern Europe is present on and around St. Boniface Down on the Isle of Wight and into the neighbouring town of Ventnor, a town known for its naturally warmer microclimate, and has shown to tolerate the high winds on the downs. It is thought that this population&#x27;s propagation (which was established in the late 1800s after having been planted by Victorian residents) has been bolstered by native Eurasian jays (&quot;Garrulus glandarius&quot;), which harvest acorns from oak trees and store them by burying them in the ground where they may then germinate. Feral goats were brought to Ventnor to control the spread of the holm oak.

It can be clipped to form a tall hedge, and it is suitable for coastal windbreaks, in any well drained soil. It forms a picturesque rounded head, with pendulous low-hanging branches. Its size and solid evergreen character gives it an imposing architectural presence that makes it valuable in many urban and garden settings. While holm oak can be grown in much of maritime northwestern Europe, it is not tolerant of cold continental winters. It is a parent of &quot;Quercus × turneri&quot;, along with &quot;Quercus robur&quot;.

Holm oak was introduced to California in 1858 and is now a widely planted and locally naturalised species; it is often called &quot;holly oak&quot; there.

==Notable trees==
The Tree Register Champion in Gloucestershire measured 8.95 m in circumference and 12 m in height in 1993. Another tree at Courtown House, Wexford, Ireland, reputedly planted in 1648, measured 20 m in height, with a spread of 43 m in 2010. An ancient tree reputed to be 500 years old at Fulham Palace, London is listed as one of the Great Trees of London.

The oldest holm oak in Spain, the Encina Tres Patas de Mendaza, located in Navarre, is reputed to be 1,200 years old. A specimen in Milo, in Sicily, is reputed to be 700 years old while a small population on the slopes of northern village of Wardija in Malta are said to be between 500 and 1,000 years old. Prior to the Carthaginian period, holm oak was prevalent on the islands.

Several holm oaks sit atop the 45 metre (148 ft) tall, 14th century Guinigi Tower in Lucca, Italy, making it a notable tourist attraction for the city. 

The Roman poet Horace predicted that the ilex growing on his farm would become famous when he included it in his hymn to the Spring of Bandusia there (Odes 3.13.12–16):

fies nobilium tu quoque fontium,
me dicente cavis impositam ilicem
saxis, unde loquaces
lymphae desiliunt tuae.

(You will become one of the famous springs, too,
Now that I am telling of the ilex planted over your stone
Hollows, where your babbling
Waters leap down.)

<text>Cytogenetics is essentially a branch of genetics, but is also a part of cell biology/cytology (a subdivision of human anatomy), that is concerned with how the chromosomes relate to cell behaviour, particularly to their behaviour during mitosis and meiosis. Techniques used include karyotyping, analysis of G-banded chromosomes, other cytogenetic banding techniques, as well as molecular cytogenetics such as fluorescence &quot;in situ&quot; hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).

==History==

===Beginnings===

Chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by Carl Nägeli in 1842. Their behavior in animal (salamander) cells was described by Walther Flemming, the discoverer of mitosis, in 1882. The name was coined by another German anatomist, von Waldeyer in 1888.

The next stage took place after the development of genetics in the early 20th century, when it was appreciated that the set of chromosomes (the karyotype) was the carrier of the genes. Levitsky seems to have been the first to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes, in contrast to their genic contents. Investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question: how many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain? In 1912, Hans von Winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in spermatogonia and 48 in oogonia, concluding an XX/XO sex determination mechanism. Painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid number of humans was 46 or 48, at first favoring 46. He revised his opinion later from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on humans having an XX/XY system of sex-determination. Considering their techniques, these results were quite remarkable. In science books, the number of human chromosomes remained at 48 for over thirty years. New techniques were needed to correct this error. Joe Hin Tjio working in Albert Levan&#x27;s lab was responsible for finding the approach:

:# Using cells in culture
:# Pre-treating cells in a hypotonic solution, which swells them and spreads the chromosomes
:# Arresting mitosis in metaphase by a solution of colchicine
:# Squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane
:# Cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram.

It took until 1956 for it to be generally accepted that the karyotype of man included only 46 chromosomes. The great apes have 48 chromosomes. Human chromosome 2 was formed by a merger of ancestral chromosomes, reducing the number.

== Applications of cytogenetics ==

=== McClintock&#x27;s work on maize ===
Barbara McClintock began her career as a maize cytogeneticist. In 1931, McClintock and Harriet Creighton demonstrated that cytological recombination of marked chromosomes correlated with recombination of genetic traits (genes). McClintock, while at the Carnegie Institution, continued previous studies on the mechanisms of chromosome breakage and fusion flare in maize. She identified a particular chromosome breakage event that always occurred at the same locus on maize chromosome 9, which she named the &quot;Ds&quot; or &quot;dissociation&quot; locus. McClintock continued her career in cytogenetics studying the mechanics and inheritance of broken and ring (circular) chromosomes of maize. During her cytogenetic work, McClintock discovered transposons, a find which eventually led to her Nobel Prize in 1983.

=== Natural populations of &quot;Drosophila&quot; ===
In the 1930s, Dobzhansky and his coworkers collected &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot; and &quot;D. persimilis&quot; from wild populations in California and neighboring states. Using Painter&#x27;s technique they studied the polytene chromosomes and discovered that the wild populations were polymorphic for chromosomal inversions. All the flies look alike whatever inversions they carry: this is an example of a cryptic polymorphism.

Evidence rapidly accumulated to show that natural selection was responsible. Using a method invented by L&#x27;Héritier and Teissier, Dobzhansky bred populations in &quot;population cages&quot;, which enabled feeding, breeding and sampling whilst preventing escape. This had the benefit of eliminating migration as a possible explanation of the results. Stocks containing inversions at a known initial frequency can be maintained in controlled conditions. It was found that the various chromosome types do not fluctuate at random, as they would if selectively neutral, but adjust to certain frequencies at which they become stabilised. By the time Dobzhansky published the third edition of his book in 1951 he was persuaded that the chromosome morphs were being maintained in the population by the selective advantage of the heterozygotes, as with most polymorphisms.

=== Lily and mouse ===

The lily is a favored organism for the cytological examination of meiosis since the chromosomes are large and each morphological stage of meiosis can be easily identified microscopically. Hotta, Chandley et al. presented the evidence for a common pattern of DNA nicking and repair synthesis in male meiotic cells of lilies and rodents during the zygotene–pachytene stages of meiosis when crossing over was presumed to occur. The presence of a common pattern between organisms as phylogenetically distant as lily and mouse led the authors to conclude that the organization for meiotic crossing-over in at least higher eukaryotes is probably universal in distribution.

==Human abnormalities and medical applications==

Following the advent of procedures that allowed easy enumeration of chromosomes, discoveries were quickly made related to aberrant chromosomes or chromosome number.

Constitutional cytogenetics: In some congenital disorders, such as Down syndrome, cytogenetics revealed the nature of the chromosomal defect: a &quot;simple&quot; trisomy. Abnormalities arising from nondisjunction events can cause cells with aneuploidy (additions or deletions of entire chromosomes) in one of the parents or in the fetus. In 1959, Lejeune discovered patients with Down syndrome had an extra copy of chromosome 21. Down syndrome is also referred to as trisomy 21.

Other numerical abnormalities discovered include sex chromosome abnormalities. A female with only one X chromosome has Turner syndrome, whereas a male with an additional X chromosome, resulting in 47 total chromosomes, has Klinefelter syndrome. Many other sex chromosome combinations are compatible with live birth including XXX, XYY, and XXXX. The ability for mammals to tolerate aneuploidies in the sex chromosomes arises from the ability to inactivate them, which is required in normal females to compensate for having two copies of the chromosome. Not all genes on the X chromosome are inactivated, which is why there is a phenotypic effect seen in individuals with extra X chromosomes.

Trisomy 13 was associated with Patau syndrome and trisomy 18 with Edwards syndrome.

Acquired cytogenetics: In 1960, Peter Nowell and David Hungerford discovered a small chromosome in the white blood cells of patients with Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This abnormal chromosome was dubbed the Philadelphia chromosome - as both scientists were doing their research in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Thirteen years later, with the development of more advanced techniques, the abnormal chromosome was shown by Janet Rowley to be the result of a translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22. Identification of the Philadelphia chromosome by cytogenetics is diagnostic for CML. More than 780 leukemias and hundreds of solid tumors (lung, prostate, kidney, etc.) are now characterized by an acquired chromosomal abnormality, whose prognostic value is crucial. The identification of these chromosomal abnormalities has led to the discovery of a very large number of &quot;cancer genes&quot; (or oncogenes). The increasing knowledge of these cancer genes now allows the development of targeted therapies, which transforms the prospects of patient survival. Thus, cytogenetics has had and continues to have an essential role in the progress of cancer understanding. Large databases (Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology, COSMIC cancer database, Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer) allow researchers and clinicians to have the necessary corpus for their work in this field.

===Advent of banding techniques===

In the late 1960s, Torbjörn Caspersson developed a quinacrine fluorescent staining technique (Q-banding) which revealed unique banding patterns for each chromosome pair. This allowed chromosome pairs of otherwise equal size to be differentiated by distinct horizontal banding patterns. Banding patterns are now used to elucidate the breakpoints and constituent chromosomes involved in chromosome translocations. Deletions and inversions within an individual chromosome can also be identified and described more precisely using standardized banding nomenclature. G-banding (utilizing trypsin and Giemsa/ Wright stain) was concurrently developed in the early 1970s and allows visualization of banding patterns using a bright field microscope.

Diagrams identifying the chromosomes based on the banding patterns are known as &quot;idiograms&quot;. These maps became the basis for both prenatal and oncological fields to quickly move cytogenetics into the clinical lab where karyotyping allowed scientists to look for chromosomal alterations. Techniques were expanded to allow for culture of free amniocytes recovered from amniotic fluid, and elongation techniques for all culture types that allow for higher-resolution banding.

===Beginnings of molecular cytogenetics===
In the 1980s, advances were made in molecular cytogenetics. While radioisotope-labeled probes had been hybridized with DNA since 1969, movement was now made in using fluorescent-labeled probes. Hybridizing them to chromosomal preparations using existing techniques came to be known as fluorescence &quot;in situ&quot; hybridization (FISH). This change significantly increased the usage of probing techniques as fluorescent-labeled probes are safer. Further advances in micromanipulation and examination of chromosomes led to the technique of chromosome microdissection whereby aberrations in chromosomal structure could be isolated, cloned, and studied in ever greater detail.

==Techniques==

===Karyotyping===
The routine chromosome analysis (Karyotyping) refers to analysis of metaphase chromosomes which have been banded using trypsin followed by Giemsa, Leishmanns, or a mixture of the two. This creates unique banding patterns on the chromosomes. The molecular mechanism and reason for these patterns are unknown, although it likely related to replication timing and chromatin packing.

Several chromosome-banding techniques are used in cytogenetics laboratories. Quinacrine banding (Q-banding) was the first staining method used to produce specific banding patterns. This method requires a fluorescence microscope and is no longer as widely used as Giemsa banding (G-banding). Reverse banding, or R-banding, requires heat treatment and reverses the usual black-and-white pattern that is seen in G-bands and Q-bands. This method is particularly helpful for staining the distal ends of chromosomes. Other staining techniques include C-banding and nucleolar organizing region stains (NOR stains). These latter methods specifically stain certain portions of the chromosome. C-banding stains the constitutive heterochromatin, which usually lies near the centromere, and NOR staining highlights the satellites and stalks of acrocentric chromosomes.

High-resolution banding involves the staining of chromosomes during prophase or early metaphase (prometaphase), before they reach maximal condensation. Because prophase and prometaphase chromosomes are more extended than metaphase chromosomes, the number of bands observable for all chromosomes (&quot;bands per haploid set&quot;, bph; &quot;band level&quot;) increases from about 300 to 450 to as many as 800. This allows the detection of less obvious abnormalities usually not seen with conventional banding.

====Slide preparation====
Cells from bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, cord blood, tumor, and tissues (including skin, umbilical cord, chorionic villi, liver, and many other organs) can be cultured using standard cell culture techniques in order to increase their number. A mitotic inhibitor (colchicine, colcemid) is then added to the culture. This stops cell division at mitosis which allows an increased yield of mitotic cells for analysis. The cells are then centrifuged and media and mitotic inhibitor are removed, and replaced with a hypotonic solution. This causes the white blood cells or fibroblasts to swell so that the chromosomes will spread when added to a slide as well as lyses the red blood cells. After the cells have been allowed to sit in hypotonic solution, Carnoy&#x27;s fixative (3:1 methanol to glacial acetic acid) is added. This kills the cells and hardens the nuclei of the remaining white blood cells. The cells are generally fixed repeatedly to remove any debris or remaining red blood cells. The cell suspension is then dropped onto specimen slides. After aging the slides in an oven or waiting a few days they are ready for banding and analysis.

====Analysis====
Analysis of banded chromosomes is done at a microscope by a clinical laboratory specialist in cytogenetics (CLSp(CG)). Generally 20 cells are analyzed which is enough to rule out mosaicism to an acceptable level. The results are summarized and given to a board-certified cytogeneticist for review, and to write an interpretation taking into account the patient&#x27;s previous history and other clinical findings. The results are then given out reported in an &quot;International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature 2009&quot; (ISCN2009)..

===Fluorescence in situ hybridization===

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) refers to using fluorescently labeled probe to hybridize to cytogenetic cell preparations.

In addition to standard preparations FISH can also be performed on:
* bone marrow smears
* blood smears
* paraffin embedded tissue preparations
* enzymatically dissociated tissue samples
* uncultured bone marrow
* uncultured amniocytes
* Cytospin preparations

====Slide preparation====
&quot;This section refers to the preparation of standard cytogenetic preparations&quot;

The slide is aged using a salt solution usually consisting of 2X SSC (salt, sodium citrate). The slides are then dehydrated in ethanol, and the probe mixture is added. The sample DNA and the probe DNA are then co-denatured using a heated plate and allowed to re-anneal for at least 4 hours. The slides are then washed to remove the excess unbound probe, and counterstained with 4&#x27;,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or propidium iodide.

====Analysis====
Analysis of FISH specimens is done by fluorescence microscopy by a clinical laboratory specialist in cytogenetics. For oncology, generally, a large number of interphase cells are scored in order to rule out low-level residual disease, generally between 200 and 1,000 cells are counted and scored. For congenital problems usually 20 metaphase cells are scored.

==Future of cytogenetics==
Advances now focus on molecular cytogenetics including automated systems for counting the results of standard FISH preparations and techniques for virtual karyotyping, such as comparative genomic hybridization arrays, CGH and Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays.

<text>Shannon Meta Whirry (born 1964/1965) is an American actress.

==Early life==
Shannon Meta Whirry was born in Green Lake, Wisconsin, United States, the daughter of Sherril Jean &quot;Sherry&quot; (; 1944–2016) and Russell Clyde Whirry (1943–1988).

==Career==
A native of Green Lake, Wisconsin, where she was the salutatorian of her 1983 high school graduating class, in 1985 Whirry was accepted to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, one of only 365 accepted out of 3,000 applicants and one of only 65 to graduate the 2-year program. While attempting to establish her career in New York, Whirry worked as a bartender, took a number of small bit roles and appeared in a commercial for FedEx; the latter work finally allowed her to join the Screen Actors Guild. Her first film role was in the action film &quot;Out for Justice&quot; starring Steven Seagal.

She thereafter began to work in a number of direct-to-video erotic B-movies and unrated thrillers, concurrent with Tanya Roberts, Maria Ford, and Shannon Tweed, who appeared in the same kinds of films at the time. She starred in Gregory Hippolyte&#x27;s productions of &quot;Animal Instincts I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, &quot;Body of Influence&quot;, and &quot;Mirror Images II&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; referred to Whirry and Hippolyte as &quot;the Dietrich and Von Sternberg of the soft-core set&quot;. Other films at the time included &quot;Private Obsession&quot; and &quot;Playback&quot;, a &quot;Playboy&quot; production.

In the late 1990s, she transitioned from erotic thrillers into a series of roles on mainstream network television and films, including action, sci-fi and horror genres. She had a recurring role as Mike Hammer&#x27;s secretary Velda in the television series &quot;Mike Hammer, Private Eye&quot; and made guest appearances on such shows as &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;V.I.P.&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; and &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. She also had a small role in the Jim Carrey film &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; (2000).

In 2007, she appeared on a BBC TV miniseries, &quot;Nuclear Secrets&quot;, playing Kitty Oppenheimer, the wife of Robert Oppenheimer.

She occasionally performs with theater companies in Arizona, where she lives and has continued appearing in small roles in films, including independent film &quot;Raising Buchanan&quot; in 2019.

<text>Flore Célestine Thérèse Henriette Tristán y Moscoso (7 April 1803 – 14 November 1844), better known as Flora Tristan, was a French-Peruvian writer and socialist activist. She made important contributions to early feminist theory, and argued that the progress of women&#x27;s rights was directly related with the progress of the working class. She wrote several works, the best known of which are &quot;Peregrinations of a Pariah&quot; (1838), &quot;Promenades in London&quot; (1840), and &quot;The Workers&#x27; Union&quot; (1843). Tristan was the grandmother of the painter Paul Gauguin.

== Early life ==
Tristan&#x27;s full name was Flore Célestine Thérèse Henriette Tristán y Moscoso. Her father, Mariano Eusebio Antonio Tristán y Moscoso, was a colonel of the Spanish Navy, born in Arequipa, a city in Peru. His family was one of the most powerful families in the south of the country; his brother Pío de Tristán became viceroy of Peru. Tristan&#x27;s mother, Anne-Pierre Laisnay, was French; the couple met in Bilbao, Spain.

When Tristan&#x27;s father died in 1807, before her fifth birthday, the family&#x27;s situation changed drastically from the high standards of living Tristan and her mother were accustomed to. In 1833 she travelled to Arequipa to claim her paternal inheritance, which was in possession of her uncle, Juan Pío de Tristán y Moscoso. She remained in Peru until 16 July 1834. Though she never secured her inheritance, Tristan wrote a travel diary about her experiences in Peru during its tumultuous post-independence period. The diary was published in 1838 as &quot;Pérégrinations d&#x27;une paria&quot; (&quot;Peregrinations of a Pariah&quot;). Around this time, Tristan met and was influenced by the philosophy of the androgynous mystic Simon Ganneau, as well as the occultist writer Éliphas Lévi, her longtime friend.

== Contributions ==
Repressed for the most part in history, women&#x27;s historiography has been gaining traction in the attempt of historians to highlight “minoritized” histories. Through her writings, Flora Tristan was able to show the ability of women to conceptualize the idea of freedom which emanated from her works.

Seeing the failure of the promises of capitalism, Tristan wrote from a deep desire for social progress—combining the women&#x27;s struggle with socialism. When one traces socialism going together with feminism, Tristan becomes the key person in this amalgamation. Tristan would be known as the “mother of feminism and of popular communitarian socialism”, fighting the prejudice and misogyny that powers women&#x27;s oppression.

Flora Tristan was “the first woman to try to merge the proto-feminist and social discourses into a critical synthesis, opening the way leading for the future shape of feminism of a proletarian class character, which finds it inconceivable that there exist oppressed women who are capable of oppressing other women”.

Tristan highlighted themes and ideas that give primacy to worker&#x27;s rights. She was the first one to conceive the idea that the emancipation of the proletariat would be the synthesis of the people&#x27;s struggle against the bourgeoisie. She further added that this was only to be possible with the emancipation of the sexes.

Tristan organized the fragmented ideas of women&#x27;s equality at that time, brought by the French Revolution. She provided the platform for the later rise of feminism in the late 19th century. Tristan would die “defending the rights of the proletarian or rather demanding them for him; she died whilst preaching, through her words and her actions, the law of union and love that she had brought to him”.

Flora Tristan&#x27;s life, works, and ideals have proved fruitful for the excavation of women&#x27;s work through time. Establishing histories that would focus on the contribution of women, Flora Tristan has provided much in the progressing excavation of women&#x27;s role in our history.

<text>Quercus garryana is an oak tree species named for Nicholas Garry, deputy governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. It is commonly known as the Garry oak, Oregon white oak or Oregon oak.

The species is found in the Pacific Northwest, with a range stretching from southern California to southwestern British Columbia.

==Description==
&quot;Quercus garryana&quot; is typically of medium height, growing slowly to around and occasionally as high as , or in shrub form to tall. The trunks grow to thick, exceptionally . The bark is gray and fissured. It has the characteristic oval profile of other oaks when solitary, but is also known to grow in groves close enough together that crowns may form a canopy. The leaves are deciduous, long and 1–3 in broad, with 3–7 deep lobes on each side, darker green on top and finely haired below. The flowers are catkins. The fruit a small acorn long, rarely in, and broad, with shallow, scaly cups. Its fall color is unspectacular, with many trees turning plain brown. Other individuals may have subtle mixtures of brown, green and yellow, or in less common cases a fairly bright &#x27;peas and corn&#x27; effect.

The Oregon white oak is commonly found in the Willamette Valley hosting the mistletoe &quot;Phoradendron flavescens&quot;. It is also commonly found hosting galls created by wasps in the family Cynipidae. &#x27;Oak apples&#x27;, green or yellow ball of up to 5 cm in size, are the most spectacular. They are attached to the undersides of leaves. One common species responsible for these galls is &quot;Cynips maculipennis&quot;. Other species create galls on stems and leaves. Shapes vary from spheres to mushroom-shaped to pencil-shaped.

Individual specimens can grow to around 500 years in age, such as those on Sauvie Island near Portland, Oregon. 

==Taxonomy==

=== Taxonomic history ===
David Douglas was the first non-native person who recorded the species (1820s) and named it after Nicholas Garry, who was deputy governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company from 1822 to 1835 and a supporter of Douglas.

=== Varieties ===
There are three varieties:

* &quot;Quercus garryana&quot; var. &quot;garryana&quot; – tree to 65 (100) ft. British Columbia south along the Cascades to the California Coast Ranges.
* &quot;Quercus garryana&quot; var. &quot;breweri&quot; – shrub to 15 ft; leaves velvety underneath. Siskiyou Mountains.
* &quot;Quercus garryana&quot; var. &quot;semota&quot; – shrub to 15 ft; leaves not velvety underneath. Sierra Nevada.

==Distribution and habitat==
It grows from sea level to an altitude of in the northern part of its range, and from in the south of the range in California.

In Oregon, the tree grows on the west side of the Cascade Range, primarily in the Willamette, Umpqua and Rogue River valleys, and along the Columbia River Gorge, as well as in canyons adjacent to the gorge.

In California, the &quot;garryana&quot; variety grows in the foothills of the Siskiyou and Klamath Mountains, the Coast Ranges of Northern California, and of the west slope of the Cascades. The &quot;semota&quot; variety grows in the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges as far south as Los Angeles County.

In Washington, the tree grows on the west side of the Cascade Range, particularly in the Puget Sound lowlands, the northeastern Olympic Peninsula, Whidbey Island, the Chehalis river valley, and the San Juan Islands. It also grows in the foothills of the southeastern Cascades and along the Columbia River Gorge.

In British Columbia, the Garry oak grows on the Gulf Islands and southeastern Vancouver Island, from west of Victoria along the east side of the island up to the Campbell River area. There are also small populations along the Fraser River on the British Columbia mainland. The northernmost population of Garry oak can be found just below 50°N on Savary Island, in the northern stretches of the Strait of Georgia. The Garry oak is the only oak native to British Columbia, and one of only two oaks (along with the bur oak) native to western Canada.

==Ecology==
It is a drought-tolerant tree. Older specimens are often affected by heart rot.

The acorns are consumed by wildlife and livestock. David Douglas recorded that bears consumed them.

In British Columbia, the Garry oak can be infested by three nonnative insects: the jumping gall wasp &quot;Neuroterus saltatorius&quot;, the oak leaf phylloxeran, and the spongy moth.

While the invasive plant disease commonly called sudden oak death attacks other Pacific Coast native oaks, it has not yet been found on the Oregon white oak. Most oak hosts of this disease are in the red oak group, while Oregon white oak is in the white oak group.

=== &quot;Quercus garryana&quot; woodlands ===
Oregon white oak is the only native oak species in British Columbia, Washington, and northern Oregon. In these areas, oak woodlands are seral, or early-successional; they depend on disturbance to avoid being overtaken by Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;). The disturbance allowing oak to persist in an area that would otherwise succeed to coniferous forest was primarily fire. Natural wildfires are relatively common in the drier portions of the Pacific Northwest where Oregon white oak is found, but fire suppression has made such events much less common. In addition, early settlers&#x27; records, soil surveys, and tribal histories indicate that deliberate burning was widely practiced by the indigenous people of these areas. Fire perpetuated the grasslands that produced food sources such as camas, chocolate lily, bracken fern, and oak; and that provided grazing and easy hunting for deer and elk. Mature Oregon white oaks are fire-resistant, and so would not be severely harmed by grass fires of low intensity. Such fires prevented Douglas-fir and most other conifer seedlings from becoming established, allowing bunch grass prairie and oak woodland to persist. Fire also kept oak woodlands on drier soils free of a shrub understory. Wetter oak woodlands historically had a substantial shrub understory, primarily snowberry. 
Oregon white oak woodlands in British Columbia and Washington are critical habitats for a number of species that are rare or extirpated in these areas, plant, animal, and bryophyte:

* Propertius duskywing butterfly &quot;Erynnis propertius&quot;, sole larval food plant is oak
* &quot;Bucculatrix zophopasta&quot; leaf-mining moth, sole larval food plant is oak
* Lewis woodpecker &quot;Melanerpes lewis&quot;
* Slender billed nuthatch &quot;Sitta carolinensis aculeata&quot;
* Sharp tailed snake &quot;Contia tenuis&quot;
* Western gray squirrel &quot;Sciurus griseus&quot;
* Western tanager &quot;Piranga ludoviciana&quot;
* Western wood peewee &quot;Contopus sordidulus&quot;
* Western bluebird &quot;Sialia mexicana&quot;
* Sessile trillium &quot;Trillium parviflorum&quot;
* Banded cord-moss &quot;Entosthodon fascicularis&quot;
* Apple moss &quot;Bartramia stricta&quot;
* (liverwort) &quot;Riccia ciliata&quot;
* Golden Paintbrush &quot;Castilleja levisecta&quot;

&quot;Quercus garryana&quot; woodlands create a landscape mosaic of grassland, savanna, woodland, and closed-canopy forest. This mosaic of varied habitats, in turn, allows many more species to live in this area than would be possible in coniferous forest alone. Parks Canada states that Garry oak woodlands support more species of plants than any other terrestrial ecosystem in British Columbia. It grows in a variety of soil types, for instance, rocky outcrops, glacial gravelly outwash, deep grassland soils, and seasonally flooded riparian areas.

The Donation Land Claim Act of 1850 encouraged settlement of Washington and Oregon by the United States and marked the beginning of the end of regular burning by native peoples of the area. The arrival of Europeans also reduced the number of natural fires that took place in Oregon white oak habitat. With fire suppression and conversion to agriculture, oak woodlands and bunch grass prairies were invaded by Douglas-fir, Oregon ash (&quot;Fraxinus latifolia&quot;), and imported pasture grasses. Oaks were logged to clear land for pasture, and for firewood and fence posts. Livestock grazing trampled and consumed oak seedlings. By the 1990s, more than half the Oregon white oak woodland habitat in the South Puget Sound area of Washington was gone. On Vancouver Island, more than 90% was gone, and on Whidbey Island up to 99% of native understory Oregon white oak habitat is gone. Remaining Oregon white oak woodlands are threatened by urbanization, conversion to Douglas-fir woodland, and invasion by shrubs, both native and nonnative (Scotch broom &quot;Cytisus scoparius&quot;, sweetbriar rose &quot;Rosa eglanteria&quot;, snowberry &quot;Symphoricarpos albus&quot;, Indian plum &quot;Oemleria cerasiformis&quot;, poison-oak &quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot;, English holly &quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot;, bird cherry &quot;Prunus avens&quot;).
Conversely, oak groves in wetter areas that historically had closed canopies of large trees are becoming crowded with young oaks that grow thin and spindly, due to lack of fires that would clear out seedlings.

&quot;Chionodes petalumensis&quot; caterpillars feed on oak leaves, including those of &quot;Quercus garryana&quot; and valley oak (&quot;Q. lobata&quot;).

==Conservation==
Oregon white oaks and their ecosystems are the focus of conservation efforts, including communities such as Tacoma, Washington, where an Oak Tree Park has been established; Oak Bay, British Columbia, which is named after the tree; and Corvallis, Oregon, which has protected the oak savannah remnants around Bald Hill. Oak Harbor, Washington, named after the tree and home to Smith Park that contains a dense grove of mature Garry Oak trees, is actively pursuing conservation of the city&#x27;s namesake tree with the formation of the Oak Harbor Garry Oak Society.

In Southwest Washington, significant acreages of Oregon white oaks are preserved in the Scatter Creek Wildlife Area, in sites such as the Scatter Creek Unit, which contain some of the few remaining areas of south Puget Sound prairie.

In Oak Bay, British Columbia, a fine of up to $10,000 may be issued for each Garry oak tree cut or damaged.

==Uses==
The mildly sweet (but perhaps unpalatable) acorns are edible, ideally after leaching. The bitterness of the toxic tannic acid would likely prevent anyone from eating enough to become ill. Native Americans ate the acorns raw and roasted, also using them to make a kind of flour.

The hardwood is hard and heavily ring-porous. It has distinctive growth rings and prominent rays. Heartwood can be a deep chocolate brown color and sapwood will vary from golden brown to nearly white. This makes it particularly attractive to woodworkers, however it can be difficult to use in woodworking without experiencing warping and cracking. Although it was popularly used around the turn of the 20th century, historically, the tree has not been regarded as having significant commercial value and is frequently destroyed as land is cleared for development. The wood is suitable for making fence posts. With similar qualities to those of other white oaks, the wood has been used experimentally in Oregon for creating casks in which to age wine. In Washington, it has been used for aging single malt whiskey since the 2010s. Oregon white oak barrels are said to give the product &quot;burnt sugar notes, marshmallow sweetness, and a light floral character that showcases the best of the Garry oak&quot;. When used as firewood, Oregon white oak produces burned.

<text>Quercus cerris, the Turkey oak or Austrian oak, is an oak native to south-eastern Europe and Asia Minor. It is the type species of &quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Cerris&quot;, a section of the genus characterised by shoot buds surrounded by soft bristles, bristle-tipped leaf lobes, and acorns that usually mature in 18 months.

==Description==

&quot;Quercus cerris&quot; is a large deciduous tree growing to tall with a trunk up to in diameter. The bark is dark gray and deeply furrowed. On mature trees, the bark fissures are often streaked orange near the base of the trunk. The glossy leaves are long and 3–5 cm wide, with 6–12 triangular lobes on each side; the regularity of the lobing varies greatly, with some trees having very regular lobes, others much less regular.

The flowers are wind-pollinated catkins, maturing about 18 months after pollination; the fruit is a large acorn, long and 2 cm broad, bicoloured with an orange basal half grading to a green-brown tip; the acorn cup is 2 cm deep, densely covered in soft &#x27;mossy&#x27; bristles from in length.

== Ecology and cultivation ==

First year acorns are very bitter, but are eaten by jays and pigeons; squirrels usually only eat them when other food sources have run out.

The species&#x27; range extended to northern Europe and the British Isles before the previous ice age, about 120,000 years ago. It was reintroduced in the UK and Ireland in the eighteenth century as an ornamental tree, its gall wasps now provide early food for birds.
The tree harbours the gall wasp &quot;Andricus quercuscalicis&quot; whose larvae seriously damage the acorns of native British oaks. In 1998, the Ministry of Defence ordered the felling of all Turkey oaks on its United Kingdom bases.

Turkey oak is widely planted and is naturalised in much of Europe. This is partly for its relatively fast growth. It is used as an ornamental, and as a coastal windbreak. Several cultivars have been selected, including &#x27;Variegata&#x27;, a variegated cultivar, and &#x27;Woden&#x27;, with large, deeply lobed leaves.

Turkey oak readily hybridises with cork oak (&quot;Q. suber&quot;), the resulting hybrid being named &quot;Q.&quot; × &quot;crenata&quot; This hybrid occurs both naturally where its parents&#x27; ranges overlap in the wild, and has also arisen in cultivation. It is a very variable medium to large tree, usually semi-evergreen, sometimes nearly completely so, and often with marked hybrid vigour; its bark is thick and fissured but never as thick as that of the cork oak. Numerous cultivars are available, often grafted onto Turkey oak root stock. These include &#x27;Ambrozyana&#x27;, evergreen except in severe winters, originating from the Arboretum in Slovakia, home of the late Count Ambrozy; &#x27;Diversifolia&#x27;, with the leaves extremely deeply cut leaving a narrow strip down the centre, and very corky bark; &#x27;Fulhamensis&#x27; (Fulham oak), raised at Osborne&#x27;s nursery in Fulham c.1760; and &#x27;Lucombeana&#x27; (Lucombe oak), raised by William Lucombe at his nursery in Exeter 1762. An early specimen raised by Lucombe is at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. A similar Lucombe oak was felled by fungus and a light wind in Phear Park, Exmouth 15 February 2009.

== Uses ==

The wood has many of the characteristics of other oaks, but is very prone to crack and split and hence is relegated to such uses as fencing.

<doc id="344887" wikidata="Q517378" url="?curid=344887" title="Boole's inequality">
<text>In probability theory, Boole&#x27;s inequality, also known as the union bound, says that for any finite or countable set of events, the probability that at least one of the events happens is no greater than the sum of the probabilities of the individual events. This inequality provides an upper bound on the probability of occurrence of at least one of a countable number of events in terms of the individual probabilities of the events. Boole&#x27;s inequality is named for its discoverer, George Boole.

Formally, for a countable set of events &quot;A&quot;1, &quot;A&quot;2, &quot;A&quot;3, ..., we have

:formula_1

In measure-theoretic terms, Boole&#x27;s inequality follows from the fact that a measure (and certainly any probability measure) is &quot;σ&quot;-sub-additive.

==Proof==

=== Proof using induction ===
Boole&#x27;s inequality may be proved for finite collections of formula_2 events using the method of induction.

For the formula_3 case, it follows that

:formula_4

For the case formula_2, we have

:formula_6

Since formula_7 and because the union operation is associative, we have

:formula_8

Since

:formula_9

by the first axiom of probability, we have

:formula_10

and therefore

:formula_11

=== Proof without using induction ===
For any events in formula_12in our probability space we have

:formula_13

One of the axioms of a probability space is that if formula_14 are &quot;disjoint&quot; subsets of the probability space then

:formula_15

this is called &quot;countable additivity.&quot;

If we modify the sets formula_16, so they become disjoint,

:formula_17

we can show that

:formula_18

by proving both directions of inclusion.

Suppose formula_19. Then formula_20 for some minimum formula_21 such that formula_22. Therefore formula_23. So the first inclusion is true: formula_24.

Next suppose that formula_25. It follows that formula_26 for some formula_21. And formula_28 so formula_20, and we have the other inclusion: formula_30.

By construction of each formula_31, formula_32. For formula_33 it is the case that formula_34

So, we can conclude that the desired inequality is true:

:formula_35

==Bonferroni inequalities==
Boole&#x27;s inequality may be generalized to find upper and lower bounds on the probability of finite unions of events. These bounds are known as Bonferroni inequalities, after Carlo Emilio Bonferroni; see .

Let

:formula_36

for all integers &quot;k&quot; in {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;}.

Then, when formula_37 is odd:
:formula_38

holds, and when formula_39 is even:
:formula_40

holds. 

The equalities follow from the inclusion–exclusion principle, and Boole&#x27;s inequality is the special case of formula_41.

=== Proof for odd K ===
Let formula_42, where formula_43 for each formula_44. These such formula_45 partition the sample space, and for each formula_45 and every formula_47, formula_45 is either contained in formula_49 or disjoint from it.

If formula_50, then formula_45 contributes 0 to both sides of the inequality. 

Otherwise, assume formula_45 is contained in exactly formula_53 of the formula_49. Then formula_45 contributes exactly formula_56 to the right side of the inequality, while it contributes 

:formula_57

to the left side of the inequality. However, by Pascal&#x27;s rule, this is equal to

:formula_58 

which telescopes to 

:formula_59 

Thus, the inequality holds for all events formula_45, and so by summing over formula_45, we obtain the desired inequality:

:formula_62 

The proof for even formula_63 is nearly identical.

=== Example ===
Suppose that you are estimating five parameters based on a random sample, and you can control each parameter separately. If you want your estimations of all five parameters to be good with a chance 95%, what should you do to each parameter?

Tuning each parameter&#x27;s chance to be good to within 95% is not enough because &quot;all are good&quot; is a subset of each event &quot;Estimate &quot;i&quot; is good&quot;. We can use Boole&#x27;s Inequality to solve this problem. By finding the complement of event &quot;all five are good&quot;, we can change this question into another condition:

:&quot;P&quot;(at least one estimation is bad) = 0.05 ≤ &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot;1 is bad) + &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot;2 is bad) + &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot;3 is bad) + &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot;4 is bad) + &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot;5 is bad)

One way is to make each of them equal to 0.05/5 = 0.01, that is 1%. In other words, you have to guarantee each estimate good to 99%( for example, by constructing a 99% confidence interval) to make sure the total estimation to be good with a chance 95%. This is called the Bonferroni Method of simultaneous inference.
