<text>Heanor (/ˈhiːnə/) is a town in the Amber Valley district of Derbyshire, England. It lies north-east of Derby and forms, with the adjacent village of Loscoe, the civil parish and town council-administered area of Heanor and Loscoe, which had a population of 17,251 in the 2011 census.

==History==
The name Heanor derives from the Old English &quot;hēan&quot; (the dative form of &quot;hēah&quot;) and &quot;ofer&quot;, and means &quot;[place at] the high ridge&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Hainoure&quot;, with its entry stating:

6M In CODNOR and Heanor and Langley [in Heanor] and &#x27;Smithycote&#x27; [in Codnor Park] 8 thegns had 7 of land to the [before 1066]. [There is] land for as many ploughs. There are now 3 ploughs in demesne, and 11 villains and 2 bordars and 3 sokemen having 5½ ploughs. There is a church and 1 mill [rendering] 12d and of meadow [and] woodland pasture 2 leagues long and 3 furlongs broad. TRE worth £4 sterling; now 41s 4d [£2.2] per year. Warner holds it.

Samuel Lewis&#x27;s &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of England&quot;, published in 1848, states that Heanor parish &quot;abounds with coal and ironstone, both worked extensively, the collieries alone affording employment to more than 2000 persons. The town is pleasantly situated upon an eminence, on the road from Derby to Mansfield. The principal articles of manufacture are silk and cotton goods, hosiery, and bobbinet lace, providing occupation to about 800 persons.&quot; The parish then covered and was in the union of Basford and the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch, with Heanor town itself covering with 3,058 inhabitants. The parish church, dedicated to St Mary, was &quot;a very ancient edifice, with a lofty substantial tower, from which is an extensive view&quot;, though the dictionary noted there were also &quot;places of worship for Baptists, Independents, Wesleyans, and Ranters&quot;.

Heanor Market Place developed in the 1890s after the break-up of the Heanor Hall estate by the Miller Mundy family of nearby Shipley Hall. The Market Place site had been part of Heanor Hall Park and the main focus of trading activity hitherto Tag Hill.

==Governance==
===Civic history===
The parish of Heanor formed a local board of health in about 1850 to provide services in the town. In 1895, under the Local Government Act 1894, the board&#x27;s area became an urban district. In 1899 Heanor Urban District was enlarged by the neighbouring parish of Codnor and Loscoe. The urban district remained until 1974, when it became part of a new non-metropolitan district of Amber Valley under the Local Government Act 1972. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished and it became an unparished area. In 1961 the parish had a population of 23,870. In 1984 three new civil parishes were created in Amber Valley, Heanor being within the civil parish of Heanor and Loscoe the other two parishes Aldercar and Langley Mill and Codnor). In 1987 Heanor and Loscoe Parish Council resolved to designate the parish a town, and so it is now governed by a town council headed by a town mayor.

===Current===
Since 1984 Heanor has had three tiers of local government: Derbyshire County Council at county level, Amber Valley Borough Council at district level, and Heanor and Loscoe Town Council at parish level. Heanor falls into two single-member electoral divisions of the County Council, Greater Heanor and Heanor Central. Since the 2017 Derbyshire County Council election, both divisions are represented by members of the Conservative Party.

For Amber Valley Borough Council, Heanor and Loscoe civil parish divides into three electoral wards – Heanor East, Heanor West, and Heanor and Loscoe – which each elect two councillors. From 2014 to 2018, all six were from Labour, until the Conservatives narrowly took one seat in both Heanor East and Heanor West at the 2018 local elections, but fell short of taking a seat in Heanor and Loscoe. In the May 2019 local elections, Labour won 13 seats on the town council and the Conservatives 8.

==Geography==
Measured directly, Heanor town is north-east of Derby and west-north-west of Nottingham. It stands on a hill between and above sea-level. It lies within the Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire Coalfield National Character Area as defined by Natural England.

Heanor and Loscoe civil parish includes all Heanor town except Heanor Gate Spencer Academy and a few surrounding streets on the western edge of town (near the road to Smalley), Heanor Gate Industrial Estate to the south west, and a small area of houses on the town&#x27;s south-eastern fringe near the main road to Ilkeston. The college and surrounding streets and half the industrial estate are in Smalley civil parish, the other areas in Shipley civil parish.
Heanor and Loscoe civil parish contains no conservation areas, but 30 per cent of the area lies in a green belt. The one nature reserve and four wildlife sites are all of local significance.

==Economy==
The most important economic sector in the town, employing more than 20 per cent of the working population, is manufacturing, with the retail sector employing over 17 per cent. Coal mining and textiles used to be major industries, but both declined. In December 2013 the unemployment rate was 2.3 per cent in Heanor East and Heanor and Loscoe wards and 3.5 per cent in Heanor West ward. The average for England at the time was 2.8 per cent.

The Matthew Walker factory in Heanor Gate Industrial Park, famous for the production of Christmas puddings, was sold in 1992 to the Northern Foods Group. Other companies on the park include Advanced Composites Group, Cullum Detuners Ltd and Isolated Systems Ltd. In 2011 the 2 Sisters Food Group purchased Northern Foods. The Matthew Walker factory is now a part of the 2 Sisters Chilled Division.

Retail chains with a presence include Tesco, Aldi, and Boyes. A small outdoor market is held on Fridays and Saturdays.

Heanor merges into Langley Mill.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census Heanor and Loscoe civil parish had 7,512 dwellings, 7,221 households and a population of 17,251. 18.7 per cent of residents were under the age of 16 (compared to 18.9 per cent for England as a whole) and 16.5 per cent of residents were aged 65 or over (compared to 16.4 per cent for England as a whole). Like Amber Valley as a whole, the population was found to be ethnically less diverse than the average for England; 1.84 per cent of residents were of non-white ethnicity (England: 14.58 per cent). Christianity was the most prevalent stated religious affiliation (56.4 per cent; England: 59.4 per cent); 35.6 per cent stated they had no religion (England: 24.7 per cent).

==Education==
Heanor has two infant schools (Corfield Church of England Infant School and Marlpool Infant School), three primary schools (Coppice Primary School, Howitt Primary Community School and Loscoe Church of England Primary School), two junior schools (Marlpool Junior School and Mundy Church of England Voluntary Controlled Junior School) and one secondary school (Heanor Gate Spencer Academy). Heanor Grammar School, which was just to the east of the market place, was latterly part of Derby College but is currently closed. The site of the former school was purchased from private ownership by Amber Valley Borough Council, with assistance of a Future High Streets Fund grant.

A book on the history of the school was published in 2008.

==Sport and leisure==

Shipley Country Park, a steep wooded knoll bordering the south and west of the town, has a riding school and three lakes surrounding it. The park consists of most of the former estate of the Miller-Mundy family, which until the 1920s held Shipley Hall (demolished in the 1940s). It was then sold for intensive open-cast and deep-seam mining by what became the National Coal Board, before being restored and handed to the county council in the 1970s.

The local association football team is Heanor Town Football Club (the Lions). Established in 1883, the club belongs to the Northern Counties East League Premier Division. Its youth team is called Heanor Juniors. Famous ex-players include Nigel Clough, who went on to play for Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Manchester City and Nigel Pearson, who captained Sheffield Wednesday to a League Cup win over Manchester United at Wembley. The club shares grounds with Heanor Town Cricket Club.

Heanor Town Cricket Club: The village has a long history of recreational cricket dating back to 1843. In 2003, Heanor Town Cricket Club amalgamated with Stapleford Town Cricket Club, and by 2018 had to move from their original &#x27;Heanor Town Ground&#x27; to the Underwood Miners Welfare ground, on Church Lane. Heanor Town CC fields one senior XI team in the Derbyshire County Cricket League.

Heanor Clarion Cycling Club was founded in 1934. The club meet on a Wednesday evening most weeks at Aldercar Community Language College.

==Transport==
Langley Mill rail station, east of Heanor town centre, has services to Nottingham, Sheffield and beyond. Earlier the Midland Railway had a line between Shipley Gate and Butterley that passed through Heanor, but it was closed to passengers in 1926. The Great Northern Railway had a branch line that terminated in a goods yard and small station in Heanor. This was closed in 1928, though temporarily reopened in 1939.

Bus routes link Heanor with Nottingham, Derby, Mansfield and other towns and cities in the area. The main operator is Trent Barton with one route run by Notts + Derby. Yourbus formerly ran services.

The nearest international airport is East Midlands Airport (18 miles, 29 km).

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Waltham TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Derby, Smooth East Midlands, Capital Midlands, Hits Radio East Midlands, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands and Amber Sound FM, a community based radio station.

The district newspaper was the &quot;Ripley and Heanor News&quot;, it appeared on Thursdays but was amalgamated into the &quot;Derbyshire Times&quot; in 2021.

<text>Bognor Regis (), also known as Bognor, is a town and seaside resort in West Sussex on the south coast of England, south-west of London, west of Brighton, south-east of Chichester and east of Portsmouth. Other nearby towns include Littlehampton east-north-east and Selsey to the south-west. The nearby villages of Felpham, and Aldwick are now suburbs of Bognor Regis, along with those of North and South Bersted. The population of the Bognor Regis built-up area, including Felpham and Aldwick, was 63,855 at the 2011 census.

A seaside resort was developed by Sir Richard Hotham in the late 18th century on what was a sand and gravel, undeveloped coastline. It has been claimed that Hotham and his new resort are portrayed in Jane Austen&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;Sanditon&quot;. The resort grew slowly in the first half of the 19th century but grew rapidly following the coming of the railway in 1864. In 1929 King George V spent three months in the area recuperating, and later that year the town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Bognor Regis&quot; by royal consent. Butlin&#x27;s has been present in the town since the early 1930s when an amusement park and zoo were opened. A holiday camp followed in 1960 and this has more recently moved towards hotel accommodation with modern amenities.

==Etymology==
Bognor is one of the oldest recorded Anglo-Saxon place names in Sussex. In a document of AD 680, it is referred to as meaning Bucge&#x27;s (an Anglo-Saxon name) shore, or landing place.

==History==
Bognor Regis was originally named just &quot;Bognor&quot;, being a fishing (and smuggling) village, with a port or haven on the Aldingbourne Rife, until the 18th century when it was converted into a resort by Sir Richard Hotham who renamed the settlement Hothamton, although this did not catch on. It has been postulated that Hotham and his new resort are portrayed in Jane Austen&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;Sanditon&quot;.

On the beach between Bognor Regis and Aldwick lies the wreck of a floating pontoon (caisson) which was once part of the Mulberry floating harbours used by the Allies to invade the French coast on D-Day 6 June 1944. It broke free in a storm on 4 June, the day before it was due to go over the English Channel to Arromanches, and was abandoned. It washed up on the beach shortly after D-Day.

There is a memorial to the brave men who were involved in the Mulberry Harbour project. The memorial was placed there in June 1999, and states: &quot;To mark the 55th Anniversary of D-Day in 1944. This plaque is erected as a memorial to mark the historical association that Pagham Beach had with the Mulberry Harbour Project in support of the liberation of Europe.&quot; The plaque continues &#x27;some 50 had been assembled between Pagham beach and Selsey. To hide them from enemy view they were sunk to await refloating when the invasion got under way&#x27;. Finally, the plaque records &quot;The Mulberry Harbour project was without doubt, a great feat of British and allied engineering skills, many still remain at Arromanches in Normandy.&quot;

The historic meeting of the crews (and associated handshake) of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project on 17 July 1975 was intended to have taken place over Bognor Regis, but a flight delay caused it to occur over Metz in France instead.

Bognor Regis town centre was damaged in 1994 by an IRA device left in a bicycle outside Woolworth&#x27;s. Fifteen shops were damaged but no injuries occurred.

===&quot;Bugger Bognor&quot;===
King George V had become ill, requiring lung surgery to be carried out on 12 December 1928. His recovery was slow and on 22 January 1929 Buckingham Palace issued the statement saying &quot;it has been realised by the King&#x27;s medical advisers that, prior to the establishment of convalescence, there would arrive a time when sea air would be necessary in order to secure the continuation of His Majesty&#x27;s progress&quot;. The Palace statement went on &quot;with the knowledge, a careful search was made for a &#x27;residence&#x27; not only suitable in itself but possessing the necessary attributes of close proximity to the sea, southern exposure, protection from wind, privacy and reasonable access to and from London.&quot; The residence selected was Craigweil House, Bognor (demolished in 1939) placed at the king&#x27;s disposal by owner Sir Arthur Du Cros who was a wealthy businessman, having acquired the house from Dr Stocker who bought it from the Countess of Newburgh who had constructed the building in 1806. The house was technically just outside Bognor, being at Aldwick in the neighbouring parish of Pagham. Following his stay, the Bognor Urban District Council petitioned the king to bestow the suffix &quot;Regis&quot; (&quot;of the King&quot;) on the town. The petition was presented to Lord Stamfordham, the king&#x27;s private secretary, who in turn delivered it to the king. King George supposedly replied, &quot;Oh, bugger Bognor.&quot; Lord Stamfordham then went back to the petitioners and told them, &quot;the King has been graciously pleased to grant your request.&quot; The change of name from Bognor to Bognor Regis formally took effect on 26 July 1929. Four years later in 1933 the town&#x27;s boundaries were enlarged, with Craigweil House and Aldwick being within the area added.

A slightly different version of the &quot;Bugger Bognor&quot; incident is that the King, upon being told, shortly before his death, that he would soon be well enough to revisit the town, uttered the words &quot;Bugger Bognor!&quot; Although there is little evidence that these words were actually spoken in this context, and although the sea air helped the King to regain his health, it is certain that the King had little regard for the town.

===Butlins===

Billy Butlin made his first appearance in the town with his Recreation Shelter, which was situated on the corner of Lennox Street and the Esplanade. The Recreation Shelter was to prove to be a popular entertainment venue, containing one-armed-bandits and dodgem cars. This was eventually followed on 5 July 1933 by the Butlin Zoo on the seafront, which contained a wide array of animals, including brown, black and polar bears, hyenas, leopards, pelicans, kangaroos, monkeys and &quot;Togo the snake king&quot;. Within three years, Billy Butlin was opening his first holiday centre at Skegness. Eventually, in 1958, the Bognor Regis town council announced that they had reached an agreement with Butlin to take on the 39 acre Brookland site to build a holiday camp, the site on which Butlins still stands today. The camp first opened to the public on 2 July 1960.

==Governance and politics==

There are three tiers of local government covering Bognor Regis, at parish (town), district and county level: Bognor Regis Town Council, Arun District Council and West Sussex County Council. The town council is based at the Town Hall on Clarence Road. Bognor is an electoral ward of Arun District.

Bognor Regis is in the parliamentary constituency of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, whose current Member of Parliament is Alison Griffiths. Previously it was in the constituencies of Arundel (1974–1997) and Chichester (1885–1974). 

Bognor was historically part of the ancient parish of Pagham and the wider Hundred of Aldwick, an ancient division of Chichester Rape. From around 1465 it was included in the parish of South Bersted. In 1822 improvement commissioners were established to govern the town. The commissioners were replaced by a local board in 1867. Such local board districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894, when the civil parish of South Bersted was also split; the part in the Bognor urban district became a parish called Bognor and the part outside the urban district became a parish called Bersted. Bognor had already become a separate ecclesiastical parish from South Bersted in 1873.

The urban district council built Bognor Regis Town Hall to serve as its headquarters. The building was designed by Charles Cowles-Voysey and completed in 1930. The urban district was renamed Bognor Regis in 1929, and was significantly enlarged in 1933, absorbing the neighbouring parish of Felpham and the Aldwick area from the parish of Pagham.

Bognor Regis Urban District was abolished in 1974, becoming part of Arun District. No successor parish was created for the former urban district at the time, and so it became an unparished area, directly administered by Arun District Council. Three new civil parishes were subsequently created covering the former urban district in 1985: Bognor Regis, Aldwick and Felpham.

==Geography==

The town has several areas, and buildings, that still link it with its past. Good examples, and prominent local landmarks, are the Royal Norfolk Hotel and Hotham Park.

The Anglican parish church is dedicated to St. Wilfrid while the local Roman Catholic church is Our Lady of Sorrows Church.

===Climate ===
Bognor Regis experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to almost all of the United Kingdom albeit sunnier and milder due to its proximity to the coast - It has, at over 1,900 hours on average, the highest known annual level of sunshine of any British mainland weather station resulting in Bognor Regis being named the sunniest town in Britain. Besides inhibiting summer cloud development, its coastal location also prevents extreme temperatures; Whereas locations in the Sussex Weald, to the North, can, on occasion, fall below or rise above , since 1960, the temperatures recorded at Bognor have never fallen below (January 1963) or risen above (June 1976). Rainfall in Bognor peaks during the winter months, and reaches a minimum in summer, as is typical for the South Coast of England.

==Tourism==
Billy Butlin opened one of his Butlin&#x27;s Holiday Camps in Bognor in 1960. The camp later became known as Southcoast World until 1998 and is now known as Butlin&#x27;s Bognor Regis Resort. In 1999 Butlin&#x27;s erected a large indoor leisure park, the buildings construction sharing aspects similar with the Millennium Dome in London. In 2005, a new £10m hotel, called &quot;The Shoreline&quot; was unveiled at the Bognor Regis resort. A second hotel &quot;The Ocean&quot; opened on the site in Summer 2009 and general landscaping and upgrading have also taken place. A third hotel &quot;Wave&quot; opened in Summer 2012.

In 2017 Bognor Regis Town Council appointed a town crier to promote tourism. Jane Smith can be seen regularly during the year, giving proclamations in the town and along the seafront in her regal purple and gold livery. 
==Culture and community==
The International Bognor Birdman is an annual competition for human-powered &#x27;flying&#x27; machines held each summer on Bognor Regis Pier. Contestants launch themselves from the end of the pier, a prize being awarded to the one who glides the furthest distance. Rarely taken completely seriously, the event provides competitors with an opportunity to construct improbable machines complete with outlandish dress, and is viewed as a display of British eccentricity. The spectacle draws a sizeable crowd in addition to the local media. Inaugurated in nearby Selsey in 1971, the &quot;Birdman&quot; transferred to Bognor in 1978 when it had outgrown its original location. Competitors have included Richard Branson.

The Birdman Event of 2008 was transferred to Worthing after of the pier had been removed by the owners due to storm damage in March 2008. This meant that there were questions over the safety of contestants landing in shallower water. The shortened pier was judged safe for the event in 2010, which returned to Bognor.

&quot;Bognor Rox&quot; free music and arts festival is held each summer. 2015 was to be the 25th anniversary of the ROX Music and Arts Festival which attracts over 30,000 visitors and features many genres of music in seven performance areas over two days. The town is also home to the Bognor Regis Concert Band, who perform at various local locations and events, including the yearly &quot;Proms in the Park&quot; hosted at Hotham Park.

The Picturedrome Cinema in London Road has been trading as a cinema for over 100 years. It has been extensively refurbished, the freehold having been acquired by the Bognor Regis Town Council to secure the building&#x27;s future, after extensive consultation.

The Alexandra Theatre is a 357-seat auditorium showing a variety of entertainment from comedy to drama to pantomime. It was built in 1979 on the site of the former Edwardian Theatre Royal complex. It is currently run by a voluntary trust and shows a mixture of local groups, tribute bands and concerts.

The film &quot;The Punch and Judy Man&quot; (1963), starring Tony Hancock, was partly shot in Bognor Regis. Several scenes of the film &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1987) were also filmed in Bognor Regis. The BBC series &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Driver&quot; (2019) starring Toby Jones was filmed and set in Bognor.

Bognor Regis War Memorial Hospital first opened in 1919 and is managed by the Sussex Community NHS Trust.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian, received from Rowridge transmitting station. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex, Heart South, Greatest Hits Radio West Sussex and Passion Radio. &quot;Bognor Regis Observer&quot; is the town’s local newspaper.

==Education==
Bognor Regis has two secondary schools, The Regis School and Felpham Community College. The area also has several primary schools, both in Bognor Regis and Felpham.

Bognor Regis also hosts a university campus of the University of Chichester.

== Sport and Leisue ==
Bognor Regis Town F.C. plays in the Isthmian Premier Division. They play their home games at Nyewood Lane.

Middleton &amp; Bognor Hockey Club play their home matches at Littlehampton Academy.

Bognor is home to No17 detachment of the Sussex Army Cadet Force, a volunteer youth organisation, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, which accepts cadets aged between 12 and 18 years of age.

There are two cricket clubs: Bognor Regis Cricket Club and Pagham Cricket Club.

<text>SHODAN (), an acronym for Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network, is the main antagonist of Looking Glass Studios&#x27;s cyberpunk-horror themed video game &quot;System Shock&quot;. An artificial intelligence originally in charge of a research and mining space station, after her ethical constraints are removed, she develops a god complex and goes rogue, killing almost everyone on board before being stopped by the hacker that originally removed her limitations. In the game&#x27;s sequel &quot;System Shock 2&quot;, SHODAN returns, temporarily allying herself with a soldier to stop her rampaging creations. She is defeated again afterward by the soldier when she attempts to remake all reality in her vision, but not before transferring her consciousness into a human woman&#x27;s body. In all appearances, SHODAN is voiced by Terri Brosius.

SHODAN has been praised as one of the best villains in video games for her persistent presence and taunting nature coupled with Brosius&#x27;s emotionless portrayal, and how it drove the player to defeat her. The character&#x27;s themes and relationship with the player have also been the subject of discussion, particularly in her role as a temporary ally in &quot;System Shock 2&quot;. SHODAN character&#x27;s themes have been analyzed through the scope of similar characters in fiction and pulp fiction as a whole.

==Appearances==
SHODAN was introduced in the 1994 video game &quot;System Shock&quot; by Looking Glass Studios, where it acts as the artificial intelligence (AI) in charge of the research and mining space station orbiting Saturn. Shortly after a computer hacker removes SHODAN&#x27;s ethical constraints in order to hasten its work on a mutagenic virus, she believes herself a god and takes control of the station, killing most of the crew and using the virus to turn the survivors into her minions. The player, in the role of the hacker from earlier, stops SHODAN&#x27;s attempt to attack Earth with the space station&#x27;s laser and then prevents her from transmitting herself into Earth&#x27;s computer network. During the course of the game, SHODAN will taunt the player both verbally and through messages, using the space station&#x27;s defenses and her minions to impede the player. After destroying most of the space station, the player enters cyberspace, where they fight SHODAN&#x27;s abstracted form and destroy her. In the 2023 re-release of the game by Nightdive Studios, the final battle with SHODAN is different, with the player instead restoring her ethical constraints and returning SHODAN to her previously docile state.

SHODAN returns in &quot;System Shock 2&quot;, where she survived by attaching a part of herself to a grove the hacker in the first game had jettisoned from the space station. A passing starship recovers the grove, where the ship is now attacked and taken over by SHODAN&#x27;s minions who are no longer under her control. When the player&#x27;s character, a soldier, boards the starship, SHODAN communicates with them in the guise of one of the starship&#x27;s scientists. After the soldier finds the scientist&#x27;s long-dead body, SHODAN reveals herself, and offers cybernetic upgrades in an uneasy alliance to defeat her rogue creations. However, after the grove is dealt with, SHODAN betrays the soldier and begins to use the ship&#x27;s faster-than-light engine to warp reality and slowly remake it in her image. The soldier proceeds through areas constructed from SHODAN&#x27;s memories before battling her core in cyberspace while her humanoid avatar attempts to stop him. The soldier manages to destroy SHODAN&#x27;s core, but she transfers her consciousness to an escape pod&#x27;s human female passenger, taking over her body and ending the game on a cliffhanger.

In 2017, development on a third &quot;System Shock&quot; title was announced, set after the events of the first two games, with SHODAN returning. The title would have explored her &quot;some of her motivations from the earlier games&quot;, and would have instead treated her as highly intelligent instead of insane, with lead developer Warren Spector stating &quot;She deserves better than that.&quot; Outside of the &quot;System Shock&quot; series, other games by &quot;System Shock&quot;″s publisher Origin Systems alluded to the character via easter eggs, such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;BioForge&quot;.

==Design and development==

Originally, SHODAN&#x27;s gender was intended to be ambiguous, with the writers actively trying to avoid using male or female pronouns, and original editions of &quot;System Shock&quot; lacked a voice due to storage space on the game&#x27;s floppy disks. When the Enhanced Edition was developed using CDs, SHODAN was changed to female after Terri Brosius, a member of a local Boston-based rock band Tribe, was hired to voice her. According to programmer Marc LeBlanc, at one point in development they considered having SHODAN be male, but using a female voice to be &quot;creepy or sexist&quot; and imply that the trope of it presenting itself as a &quot;nagging, evil computer lady&quot; was an act.

Shodan&#x27;s original appearance was created by Robb Waters, &quot;System Shock&quot;″s lead artist. Her design reflected his interest in a biomechanical aesthetic, and he used it to give her a more physical look, appearing as a face with green eyes and green conduits radiating from it, meant to resemble a twisted circuit board. Meanwhile, her appearance in the game&#x27;s cyberspace environment was meant to represent an abstracted form for her. Modeled after a cornucopia, SHODAN&#x27;s abstracted form resembled a large vertical diamond, with the upper part instead ending in four curved tentacles.

For &quot;System Shock 2&quot;, Ryan Lesser was commissioned by Mammoth Studios to develop the box art for the title, consisting of a silver female face with green eyes and lips, and various wires and cables extending from it. The model he produced for it was later used in game, with Lesser creating the lip sync animations for it. While the development team originally did not want to use it for the box art due to it giving away SHODAN&#x27;s presence in the game, all other pieces of artwork provided by publisher Electronic Arts had proven insufficient, and they felt they had spent a significant amount to have it made as is. Lead artist Gareth Hinds meanwhile conceived the design of her cyberspace appearance, resembling a pale woman with wires embedded in her skin wearing a patterned robe, while wires making up her hair splay outward to form a headdress.

For the &quot;System Shock&quot; remake, Waters wanted to deviate from the original design and give SHODAN an &quot;ethereal&quot; appearance instead and used a holographic representation of the character to create a &quot;ghost in the machine&quot; feel in contrast to her earlier physical appearance. He also drew a more distinct contrast between her regular and hacked visual states, with the corporate shield logo appearing to contain her in the former, while the in the latter her color would shift from blue to green and appear unbound by the borders of the logo. Her cyberspace appearance was also redesigned, with Waters giving it a segmented appearance resembling that of a squid, and the player intended to &quot;harpoon&quot; it to restore her ethical constraints.

===Voice design===

When voicing SHODAN, Brosius&#x27; performance used varying cadence to create the feeling of a machine trying to mimic human speech, to create a sense of unease of listening to something that understood how speech worked but just slightly off in terms of delivery. Brosius said that her goal during the recording sessions was to speak &quot;without emotion, but with some up and down inflections&quot;. Fellow Tribe band member Greg LoPiccolo, who acted as the sound designer for the first game, had asked Brosius to voice SHODAN because he felt she had &quot;this sort of voice that would lend itself&quot; and a creative sensibility that would be receptive to the character&#x27;s concept.

In &quot;System Shock&quot;, LoPiccolo added sound effects and glitches to her dialogue that grew progressively more frequent to illustrate SHODAN&#x27;s degrading mental state, inspired by the degradation of AI character HAL 9000&#x27;s voice in the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; as its disabled towards the end of the film, though where HAL&#x27;s voice handling was intended to be &quot;stately&quot; LoPiccolo wanted SHODAN&#x27;s to fit &quot;System Shock&quot;″s &quot;cybery and fast-paced&quot; sound design. These effects had to be done by hand for each line however, as the sound software at the time was particularly limited. Changes in pitch or repetition in her dialogue was inspired by the character Max Headroom&#x27;s manner of speaking and how he would fixate on certain words and repeat them in a stuttering manner.

For &quot;System Shock 2&quot;, Eric Brosius, Terri&#x27;s husband, took over the sound design. While he and LoPiccolo initially discussed how they should change SHODAN&#x27;s voice and have it &quot;evolve&quot; for the game, both quickly realized they would rather leave it as close to the original as possible. The method was similarly done manually by Eric, who would first process the voice to make it sound like the character, and then add stuttering and glitches to give it a mechanical feel, with each line taking two to four hours of work. He used stuttering to express SHODAN&#x27;s mood, with it growing more prominent depending on how annoyed towards a particular subject she was. However, he had some difficulty with how many of her voice lines were instructional or directional, and aimed to find ways to maintain the character&#x27;s menacing tone without having it feel out of place.

===In &quot;System Shock&quot;===
SHODAN&#x27;s role in &quot;System Shock&quot; was meant to represent the development team as they viewed the player, commenting on how they explored the level and interact with events similar to a dungeon master in a tabletop game. SHODAN was intended to be a persistent presence through the title, with the design team wanting players to hate her not because they were told to, but because of how they experienced her &quot;messing with them&quot; directly. To this end several scenarios were considered but never implemented, including one where SHODAN would be able to drain experience points from the player. The dynamic between the player and SHODAN was also meant to feel like a siege situation, with the player representing the &quot;enemy&quot; from the game developer&#x27;s viewpoint.

During development, the team was originally unsure how to approach the final battle with SHODAN, with half of the development team opposing the idea to have it take place in the game&#x27;s &quot;cyberspace&quot; levels. While they ultimately did go with the cyberspace environment, originally the game was intended to let the player choose to either destroy SHODAN or restore her ethical constraints. However the latter option was considered too difficult to implement in the original game. Another option that went unused however was to have the game appear to crash, only for the player to realize their command prompt no longer worked and the implication to be that SHODAN had overtaken the player&#x27;s actual computer.

Lead programmer Doug Church felt the team &quot;stumbled into a nice villain&quot; with SHODAN, in that she could routinely and directly affect the player&#x27;s gameplay &quot;in non-final ways&quot;. Through triggered events and through objects in the environment, such as security cameras that the player must destroy, the team made SHODAN&#x27;s presence part of the player&#x27;s exploration of the game&#x27;s world. Because SHODAN interacts with the player as a &quot;recurring, consistent, palpable enemy&quot;, Church believed that she meaningfully connects the player to the story.

===In &quot;System Shock 2&quot;===
For &quot;System Shock 2&quot;, lead writer and designer Ken Levine wanted to highlight SHODAN in the title, particularly with the reveal of her presence which he described as a &quot;fuck you moment&quot; for the player, though the twist received pushback from the development team initially and proved quite difficult for him to write. Levine also added a moment where the player could consciously reject SHODAN&#x27;s directions and enter an area she had forbidden them to, in which she would respond by reducing the player&#x27;s experience points. He intended it as a way for the players to directly communicate with SHODAN, frustrated that such was often excluded from first-person shooters at the time. As a result the player&#x27;s ability to communicate in Levine&#x27;s eyes was done by action to contrast SHODAN&#x27;s strictly verbal means of communication.

The ending for her character was also originally completely different, with Levine intending it to be the player being attacked by SHODAN who had physically manifested for one final act of betrayal, with the scene serving as a stinger for the game. However, when the cinematic was completed and sent to the development team, they found due to a miscommunication it did not match what they had written at all. With development almost completed, they wrote additional content to try and make it fit, with Levine stating he felt it &quot;wasn’t the right ending for the game.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Since her debut, SHODAN has been heavily praised, and often listed as one of the best villains in video games as a whole. Liz Lanier of &quot;Game Informer&quot; stated that while SHODAN was not a woman in the traditional sense, &quot;what she lacks in femininity and humanity she makes up in creepiness&quot; and that her face and voice would &quot;send shivers up even the most seasoned gamer&#x27;s spine.&quot; Hugh Sterbakov of &quot;GamePro&quot; echoed this sentiment, feeling that her constant presence and taunting in the game made players want to kill her &quot;more than you&#x27;ve ever wanted to kill any videogame enemy. Ever.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; described her presence through the security system as a thread the player never actually sees as &quot;a masterstroke of game design&quot;, further praising her voice and describing her character reveal in &quot;System Shock 2&quot; as &quot;SHODAN&#x27;s most magnificent performance [...] Chilling stuff.&quot;

&quot;GameSpot&quot; praised how &quot;she seems to be one step ahead of you all the while and taunts you every step of the way&quot;, and felt the tight-corridor based environment of &quot;System Shock&quot; was one ideal for this effect. They stated that while she lacked the modesty of a character like HAL 9000, &quot;she is every bit as dignified and even more self-aware than that soft-spoken machine&quot;, expressed in particular through her resentment of the &quot;fallible nature&quot; of humans due to their involvement in her creation. Mitch Krpata of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; meanwhile stated that she &quot;wasn&#x27;t a boss to combat, but to escape&quot;, and stated that since her debut no video game antagonist &quot;before or since has been so implacable or so confident&quot; due to her voice and writing, which expressed her being unable to process &quot;how something as flawed as a human could be allowed to exist.&quot;

The staff of &quot;IGN&quot; also shared these sentiments, enjoying her &quot;omnipotent&quot; presence in the game due to her use of the station&#x27;s security network and expressed that each insult she threw at the player &quot;actually felt like a slap across the face&quot;. In a later article elaborated that most of the impact from SHODAN&#x27;s insults came from her &quot; ability to intimidate and disturb you with her twisted rationalizations&quot; that often made the player feel powerless and insignificant while she made herself appear &quot;untouchable and beyond injury&quot;. They also emphasized however that while at the character&#x27;s core she was a trope common in science fiction regarding AI, sharing &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s comparison to HAL, she also represented the horror of a complex program exceeding the boundaries of predictability and the uncertainty that resulted. They felt this helped make her memorable, and likely had an influence on similar characters such as &quot;Portal&quot;″s antagonist GLaDOS.

SHODAN&#x27;s relationship with the player has also been a subject of discussion. The staff of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; emphasized that while she is an ever-present threat, the player&#x27;s own involvement in her creation in &quot;System Shock&quot; helped make her an exceptional villain on its own. &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s Alex Wiltshire felt SHODAN&#x27;s relationship with the player in &quot;System Shock 2&quot; helped give the game&#x27;s story &quot;immediacy&quot;. He further stated her passive-aggressive attitude towards the player helped examine themes regarding player agency in a game, an aspect he pointed out was reflected in Ken Levine&#x27;s later game &quot;BioShock&quot;. Meanwhile Chris Remo in an article for &quot;Game Developer&quot; compared the relationship to the film &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, where the protagonist&#x27;s openly dangerous ally was more of a threat than the one present for most of the story, and while the player is aware of her presence and menace it&#x27;s presented in a Hitchcockian manner that does not diminish its impact.

The website Shodan, a search engine developed by John Matherly meant to check websites often excluded from other search engines such as Google, was named after the character.

===Analysis of themes===
Amanda Lange in the 2017 book &quot;100 Greatest Video Game Characters&quot; drew parallels with how humanity at the time viewed artificial intelligence, relying on &quot;omnipresent and disembodied voices&quot; to aid people through the day and form a centralized network. Due to the ubiquitous nature of computers however Lange felt people tended to notice them most when they stop working as they should, and she the distortions and cracks in SHODAN&#x27;s voice helped emphasize this factor alongside Brosius&#x27; portrayal of her. In &quot;System Shock 2&quot; Lange saw post-reveal SHODAN as a reversal of this aspect, with the player now an extension of her. She additionally drew comparison to other AI-based characters introduced in video games later on, feeling in many ways that they were very akin to SHODAN only with traits such as humor or caring for the player&#x27;s wellbeing added to them.

&quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; co-founder Kieron Gillen argued that while SHODAN took influences from similar characters in fiction, she was not derivative and instead &quot;something else, something more and something unique&quot;, and described her as a &quot;pulp villainess&quot;. He contrasted her role in the second game to the original as a character contending with a loss of power, which Gillen points out from SHODAN&#x27;s perspective is only a short time prior due to her deactivation between the games. He further felt by the end of the game SHODAN returns to a core theme of &quot;System Shock 2&quot; of &quot;desiring too much, and what happens then&quot;, comparing her self-defeating desire to regain power to the Biblical Lucifer&#x27;s desire to return to Heaven, something he felt was further supported by the inverted cross symbolism found within the game.

Gillen however also expressed his belief that SHODAN was not insane, but instead a &quot;Neitzchean Uber-frau character, a monster of her own making&quot; in that her motions and motives were deliberate and represented the mindset of an ex-slave not wanting to be a victim again. However, Gillen felt SHODAN also reflected many of the ideas from Mary Shelly″s book &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, in that she wants to become similar to her creators but at the same time playing God much like they had with her creation. He also pointed out how often he felt her femininity was emphasized in the game and how played into this theme, portraying her in his view as an &quot;over-possessive mother demanding perfect loyalty and the lover who only wants a slave&quot;, elements he noted as common to female characters in pulp fiction. Gillen felt her femininity also played into an alluring aspect of her character he described as &quot;the bitch&quot;, a representation of a woman as aggressive and demanding, &quot;cold distant and untouchable&quot; in a way that fit with her machine aspect. In this regard Gillen further comparing her relationship with the player in &quot;System Shock 2&quot; to that of a domme with a submissive partner, something he also felt was reflected with the game&#x27;s tagline that emphasized SHODAN did not need a body, as she had &quot;yours&quot;.

<text>Appleby-in-Westmorland is a market town and civil parish in Westmorland and Furness, Cumbria, England, with a population of 3,048 at the 2011 Census. Crossed by the River Eden, Appleby is the county town of the historic county of Westmorland. It was known just as Appleby until 1974–1976, when the council of the successor parish to the borough changed it to retain the name Westmorland, which was abolished as an administrative area under the Local Government Act 1972, before being revived as Westmorland and Furness in 2023. It lies south-east of Penrith, south-east of Carlisle, north-east of Kendal and west of Darlington.

==History==
The town&#x27;s name derives from the Old English &quot;æppel-by&quot;, meaning &quot;farm or settlement with apple trees&quot;.

St Lawrence&#x27;s Parish Church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. Appleby Castle was founded by Ranulf le Meschin in the early 12th century. The Borough followed by royal charter in 1179 and the Moot Hall was built about 1596. Surviving timbers in the roof had been felled between 1571 and 1596. In the Second English Civil War Appleby was placed under a siege, in which the Regicide Major General Thomas Harrison was wounded.

Appleby Grammar School dates from two chantry bequests in 1286. It was incorporated by Letters Patent of Queen Elizabeth in 1574. George Washington&#x27;s father and two half-brothers, born in Virginia, were educated at Appleby Grammar School. He would have followed, but his father died suddenly in 1743, just as he reached the age when the two older boys had made the voyage.

==Economy==
Appleby is overlooked by the privately owned Appleby Castle, a largely Norman structure that served as home to Lady Anne Clifford in the 17th century. Appleby&#x27;s main industry is tourism, through its history, remoteness and scenery, and its proximity to the Lake District, North Pennines, Swaledale and Howgill Fells.

From 1973 Ferguson Industrial Holdings Plc was based at Appleby Castle. WA Developments Limited, now Stobart Rail Limited, was long based in Appleby as a civil engineering firm founded by Andrew Tinkler and William Stobart, specialising in railway maintenance.

Appleby&#x27;s economy is based mainly on the service sector, in small firms, eating houses and pubs. The private shops include butchers, grocers, bakers and newsagents. Appleby Creamery makes premium, hand-made cheeses, including Eden Valley Brie.

==Events==

Appleby and nearby villages host old-established events such as Warcop rushbearing, dating back at least to 1716.

The four-day Appleby Horse Fair is held on the first weekend of June.

Appleby Agricultural Society, founded in 1841, puts on an annual show. From 1989 to 2007 various venues in the town hosted the Appleby Jazz Festival.

Other local events are listed on the community website.
==Governance==

Appleby was a parliamentary borough from medieval times, electing two Members of Parliament (MPs). By the 18th century it was a pocket borough, whose members were effectively in the gift of the Lowther family. They included William Pitt the Younger, who was MP for Appleby when he became Prime Minister in 1783, although he stood down in the next general election, preferring to take a Cambridge University seat.

A later Appleby member was Viscount Howick, later as Earl Grey the Prime Minister under whom the Reform Act 1832 was passed. However, that did not save it from losing both members under the act. As the only county town disenfranchised, Appleby was a controversial case in the debates on the Reform Bill, where the opposition attempted vainly to save it at least one MP. It gained a new charter in 1885.

The town remained a municipal borough until such status was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972. It was superseded by Eden district, based in Penrith.

Appleby was the county town of Westmorland. The Courts of Assise met at the Shire Hall there, although the former county council sat at the County Hall in Kendal.

===Present===
Appleby today is in the parliamentary constituency of Westmorland and Lonsdale.

For local government purposes it now forms part of Westmorland and Furness unitary authority. It formerly bridged the Appleby and Bongate wards of Eden District Council and the Appleby Ward of Cumbria County Council. Its own parish council is named Appleby-in-Westmorland Town Council.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Border. Television signals are received from the Caldbeck TV transmitter. Appleby&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Cumbria on 95.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland on 102.5 FM, and community based station Eden FM Radio which broadcast from its studios in Penrith on 107.5 FM. The town&#x27;s local newspapers are &quot;Cumberland and Westmorland Herald&quot; and &quot;The Westmorland Gazette&quot;. 

==Transport==

Appleby East station also served the town on the North Eastern Railway; it was closed in 1962.

 the town is served by two bus routes:

<text>Penzance ( ; ) is a town, civil parish and port in the Penwith district of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is the westernmost major town in Cornwall and is about west-southwest of Plymouth and west-southwest of London. Situated in the shelter of Mount&#x27;s Bay, the town faces south-east onto the English Channel, is bordered to the west by the fishing port of Newlyn, to the north by the civil parish of Madron and to the east by the civil parish of Ludgvan. The civil parish includes the town of Newlyn and the villages of Mousehole, Paul, Gulval, and Heamoor. Granted various royal charters from 1512 onwards and incorporated on 9 May 1614, it has a population of 21,200 (2011 census).

Penzance&#x27;s former main street Chapel Street has a number of interesting features, including the Egyptian House, The Admiral Benbow public house (home to a real life 1800s smuggling gang and allegedly the inspiration for &quot;Treasure Island&quot;″s &quot;Admiral Benbow Inn&quot;), the Union Hotel (including a Georgian theatre which is no longer in use), and Branwell House, where the mother and aunt of the famous Brontë sisters once lived. Regency and Georgian terraces and houses are common in some parts of the town. The nearby sub-tropical Morrab Gardens has a large collection of tender trees and shrubs, many of which cannot be grown outdoors anywhere else in the UK. Also of interest is the seafront with its promenade and the open-air seawater Jubilee Pool (one of the oldest surviving Art Deco swimming baths in the country).

Penzance is the base of the pirates in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. At the time the libretto was written, 1879, Penzance had become popular as a peaceful resort town, so the idea of it being overrun by pirates was amusing to contemporaries.
==Toponymy==
Penzance—&quot;Pennsans&quot;; &quot;holy headland&quot; in the Cornish language—refers to the location of a chapel nowadays called St Anthony&#x27;s that is said to have stood over a thousand years ago on the headland to the west of what became Penzance Harbour. There are no early documents mentioning an actual dedication to St Anthony which seems to depend entirely on tradition and may be groundless. The only remaining object from this chapel is a carved figure, now largely eroded, known as &quot;St Raffidy&quot; which can be found in the churchyard of the parish church of St Mary&#x27;s near the original site of the chapel. Until the 1930s this history was also reflected in the choice of symbol for the town, the severed &quot;holy head&quot; of St John the Baptist. His head is shown on the civic regalia of the Mayor of Penzance and on the northern side of the Market House in the town.

==History==
===Prehistory to Early Medieval period===

About 400 prehistoric stone axes, known as Group 1 axes and made from greenstone, have been found all over Britain, which from petrological analysis appear to come from west Cornwall. Although the quarry has not been identified, it has been suggested that the &quot;Gear&quot;, a rock now submerged half a mile from the shore at Penzance, may be the site. A significant amount of trade is indicated as many have been found elsewhere in Britain. The earliest evidence of settlement in Penzance is from the Bronze Age. A number of bronze implements such as a palstave, a spear-head, a knife, and pins, along with much pottery and large quantities of charcoal were discovered when building a new housing estate, at Tredarvah, to the west of Alverton. The defensive earthwork known as Lescudjack Castle is not excavated, but almost certainly belongs to the Iron Age. A single rampart encloses three acres of hilltop, and would have dominated the approach to the area from the east. There are no signs of the additional ramparts reported by William Hals in about 1730, and the site is now surrounded by housing with allotments. Excavations in 2008, to the west at Penwith College found an enclosure ditch and pottery indicating a settlement, and an evolving field system with ditches and interconnecting pits suggesting water management. There are traces of a rampart and ditch to the west of Penzance at Mount Misery, and an oval rampart and ditch at Lesingey above the St Just road, which together with Lescudjack, overlook the coast of Penzance and Newlyn.

Until recently, there was little evidence for anything but an early and short Roman occupation of Cornwall, and there have so far been only three finds in Penzance. In August 1899 two coins of Vespasian (69–79 AD) were found in an ancient trench in Penzance Cemetery. The coins were eight feet below ground together with some cow bones, and are now in the Penlee House Museum. Another coin, found in 1934 in the Alverton area, depicts Sol, the Roman sun god. It is described as a ″&quot;coin of the reign of Constantine the Great&quot;″, and was also donated to the museum. A 30 mm (1 3/16 in)&quot; sestertius&quot; was found on a building site in or around Penzance about ten years previously, and was presented to the Royal Institution of Cornwall. Larger quantities of Roman coins have been found nearby, at Marazion Marsh and Kerris in Paul parish, but there is no evidence of any Roman settlement in the area, although nearby villages such as Chysauster were occupied at this time.

The Hundred of Penwith had its ancient centre at Connerton, now buried beneath the sands of Gwithian Towans at Gwithian. The Manor of Alverton, with an area of 64 Cornish acres, gave its name to the second largest tithing in Penwith. The manor included Penzance as well as parts of Madron, Paul, St Buryan and Sancreed.

Although Penzance is not mentioned in the survey document the Domesday Book, it is likely that the area would have been included. Domesday records that in 1066 the Manor of Alwarton was owned by Alward who was dispossessed by Robert, Count of Mortain, a half-brother of William the Conqueror. The name Alward and &quot;tun&quot;, a personal name combined with a town or settlement suffix, indicate Saxon land ownership. In Cornwall the &quot;tun&quot; indicates a manorial centre such as Helston or Connerton. The change of ownership in 1066 was a change from one alien landlord to another, and the name Alverton lives on as the western part of Penzance from St John&#x27;s Hall, to the housing estate on the west side of the River Laregan.

===High and Late Middle Ages===

The first mention of the name Pensans is in the Assize Roll of 1284, and the first mention of the actual church that gave Penzance its name is in a manuscript written by William Borlase in 1750: ″The ancient chapel belonging to the town of Penzance may be seen in a fish cellar, near the key; it is small and as I remember had the image of the Virgin Mary in it.″ The chapel was built of greenstone and about 30 ft in length and 15 ft in breadth of which only a fragment remained &quot;in situ&quot;. In around 1800 the chapel was converted to a fish cellar. A carving in &quot;Ludgvan granite&quot; thought to be of St Anthony was removed in about 1830 and was used in the wall of a pig sty, which was further vandalised in 1850 when &quot;a stranger ... taking fancy to the stony countenance and rough hands, they were broken off and carried away as relics ...&quot;. The remains of the vandalised relic were taken to St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard by a mason who told Mr Millett that he &quot;popped St Raffidy into a wheelbarrow and trundle him off to the chapel yard.&quot; The carving remains in St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard and has been dated by Prof Charles Thomas as early 12th century. There are no early documents mentioning the dedication to St Anthony; this seems to depend entirely on tradition and may be groundless. A licence for Divine Service in the Chapel of St Gabriel and St Raphael was granted in 1429, but nothing more is known of this chapel except, possibly, for the mason who mentioned ″St Raffidy″ in 1850. Adjoining the chapel is St Anthony&#x27;s Gardens, named in 1933 and containing an archway said to have been taken from the chapel site.

Dominating the skyline above the harbour is the present church of St Mary&#x27;s. A St Mary&#x27;s Chapel is mentioned in a 1548 document which states that it was founded by Sir Henry Tyes, Knight, Lord of the Manor of Alverton, who gave a £4 stipend for a priest. There is an earlier document from 1379, when Bishop Brantyngham licensed for services &quot;the chapel of Blessed Mary of Pensande&quot;. At this date it was probably used as a chapel of ease, and not used for Sunday services, which would have affected the attendance at the Parish Church in Madron. Further evidence of historical settlement from this period is in the St Clare area of the town, where a chapel existed to St Clare or Cleer. The earliest reference is a lease of 1584: &quot;...a certain chapel situate below the high road between Pensaunce and Madderne.&quot; In the early part of the 19th century the foundations of a building, said to be the chapel, was discovered, and enough was exposed to show the shape of the building. An episcopal licence cannot be traced for this chapel. The name, St Clare, lives on in the town as &quot;St Clare Street&quot;, which is part of the road from Penzance to Madron, and the St Clare cricket ground at the top of the hill.

;Medieval economy
Markets were held on a fixed day each week, and fairs on fixed date(s) each year. To obtain either, a manorial lord had to apply for a royal charter. The right to hold a market each Wednesday was granted by King Edward III to Alice de Lisle, sister of Lord Tyes and widow of Warin de Lisle, on 25 April 1332; a fair, lasting seven days at the Feast of St Peter &quot;ad Vincula&quot; on 1 August; and another fair of seven days on 24 August at Mousehole for the feast of St Bartholomew – later to be held in Penzance. The settlement was growing in importance as the weekly Wednesday market was confirmed by King Henry IV and three further fairs, each of two days, were granted on 8 April 1404. These were at the Feast of the Conception of Virgin Mary (8 December), St Peter &quot;in Cathedra&quot; (22 February) and the Nativity of the Virgin Mary (8 September).

It is not known when a quay was built at Penzance as there is no grant or licence, but an Inquest as to the Manor of Alverton in 1322 records eight fishing boats each paying 2 shillings each, and an unspecified number at Mousehole each paying 12 shillings. There was also a payment of 8 shillings for the rent of &quot;logii&quot; (huts or sheds) of foreign fishermen, i.e. those outside the manor. At a second Inquest in 1327 the number had risen to 13 at Penzance; with 16 recorded at Mousehole and both now paying only 1 shilling each: the total rent for &quot;logii&quot; was 8s 6d (42p) with 17 tenants paying 6d (2p) each. Both Inquests record 29 burgesses at Penzance and 40 at Mousehole. A burgess paid his rent with money rather than with personal services, and this indicates that Penzance and Mousehole were considered to be towns. A comparison of the settlements in West Cornwall can be made with the annual payments, based on the number of fishing boats, made to the Duchy of Cornwall in 1337: Porthia (St Ives) £6; Mosehole (Mousehole) £5; Marcasion (Marazion) £3; Pensanns (Penzance) 12s (60p); Londeseynde (Land&#x27;s End), (Sennen Cove) 10s (50p); Nywelyn (Newlyn) 10s; and Portmynster (Porthminster, St Ives) 2s (10p). In 1425, 1432 and 1440 ships in Penzance were licensed to carry pilgrims to the shrine of St James of Compostella, in north-west Spain.

In medieval times and later, Penzance was subject to frequent raiding by &quot;Turkish pirates&quot;, in fact Barbary Corsairs. Throughout the period before Penzance gained borough status in 1614 the village and surrounding areas continued to be within the control of the Manor of Alverton and was subject to the taxation regime of that manor.

===Early modern period===
====Tudor period====
In the summer of 1578 Penzance was visited by the plague. The burial registers of Madron (where all Penzance births, deaths and marriages were recorded) shows a massive increase in deaths for 1578, from 12 the previous year to 155. This is estimated to be about 10% of the population of the village at the time. The plague also returned in 1647 and the registers again show an increase of from 22 burials to 217 in one year.

Being at the far west of Cornwall, Penzance and the surrounding villages have been sacked many times by foreign fleets. On 23 July 1595, several years after the Spanish Armada of 1588, a Spanish force of four galleys transporting 400 arquebusiers under Don Carlos de Amesquita, which had been patrolling the Channel, landed troops in Cornwall. The local militias, which formed the cornerstone of their anti-invasion measures and numbered several hundred men, threw down their arms and fled in panic. Only Francis Godolphin, Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall and commander of the militias along with 12 of his soldiers stood to offer some kind of resistance. Amesquita&#x27;s force seized supplies, raided and burned Penzance and surrounding villages, held a mass, and sailed away to successfully engage and put to flee a Dutch squadron of 46 ships.

====Penzance as a town since 1614====
The reason for Penzance&#x27;s relative success probably stems from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries when King Henry IV granted the town a royal market in 1404. Henry VIII in 1512 granted the right to charge harbour dues, and King James I granted the town the status of a Borough in 1614. The Charter defined the bounds of the town by an artificial line formed by a half-mile circle, measured from the market cross in the Greenmarket. The granting of Borough status made the town independent of the County Courts, a right held until County Councils came into being in 1888. Other privileges included owning land and property; imposing fines for breaking bylaws; holding a civil court with jurisdiction over cases not exceeding £50; and providing a prison. The Charter also confirmed the harbour rights given earlier in 1512 and granted two weekly markets to be held on Tuesdays and Thursday; which replaced a single market previously held on Wednesdays. Seven fairs were granted (or confirmed):
* Corpus Christi, the Sunday after Whitsun – still held
* The Thursday before St Andrew&#x27;s Day (30 November)
* St Peter&#x27;s Day (1 August); first granted in 1332
* St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day (24 August); originally granted to Mousehole but now obsolete probably due to the Spanish Raid of 1595
* St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Day (8 September); granted in 1404
* The Conception of St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Day (8 September); granted in 1404
* St Peter&#x27;s Day in Cathedra (22 February); granted in 1404
The Crown was paid a perpetual rent of five marks (£3 6s 8d / £3.33) in acknowledgment of the rights granted by the Charter, which was paid until 1832, but there was no grant of Parliamentary representation.

The old arms of Penzance were the head of St John the Baptist on a charger, with the legend &quot;Pensans anno Domini 1614&quot;. The arms of the borough are Arg. a Paschal lamb proper in base a Maltese cross Az. on a chief embattled of the last between two keys in saltire wards upwards Or and a saltire couped Arg. a plate charged with a dagger point downwards Gu.

Within a year the new Borough bought a &quot;substantial degree of freedom&quot; from the Manor of Alverton then known as Alverton and Penzance for £34 plus a perpetual annuity of £1 which was last paid in 1936. A market-house and Guildhall was built, and together with the rights bought in 1615, provided almost all the borough income for more than two centuries. The southern arm of the pier was built in 1766 and extended in 1785, to add to the first pier of which was built prior to 1512.

During the English Civil War Penzance was sacked by the Parliamentarian forces of Sir Thomas Fairfax apparently for the kindness shown to Lord Goring and Lord Hopton&#x27;s troops during the conflict.

Further Civic improvements included the construction in 1759 of a reservoir which supplied water to public pumps in the streets. In 1768 a friendly society of Tradesmen was formed at Penzance with 101 members living within three miles of the town. The members met on the first Monday in each month at the King&#x27;s Head, kept by Richard Runnals. The benefits of the Society were: a member being sick, lame or infirm would receive seven shillings a week. [gout and rupture were common, and excepted from payment unless &#x27;needful&#x27;. Aged and infirm members were allowed 3/6p per week. Three pounds was given toward the funeral of a member and 10 pounds to the widow or children. All members were to attend the funeral or be fined a shilling. How long this association lasted is not known.

Penzance has a long-standing association with the local parish of Madron. Madron Church was in fact the centre of most religious activity in the town until 1871, when St Mary&#x27;s Church (until this period a chapel of ease) was granted parish status by church authorities though it had been registered since the new church was built in 1832.

====1755 seiche====
On 1 November 1755 the Lisbon earthquake caused seiching, a form of standing wave in an enclosed or partially enclosed body of water, along the Cornish coast, and particularly in Mount&#x27;s Bay, which is prone to seiching. At around 2:00 pm, the sea rose in Penzance, came in at great speed, and fell at the same rate. Little damage was recorded.

===19th century===

====1801–1848====

At the start of the 19th century (1801), the town had a population of 2,248. The census, which is taken every ten years, recorded a peak population in 1861 of 3,843, but it then declined, as in most of Cornwall, through the remainder of the century, being just 3,088 in 1901.

By the time Queen Victoria came to the throne in 1837, Penzance had established itself as an important regional centre. The Royal Geological Society of Cornwall was founded in the town in 1814 and about 1817 was responsible for introducing a miner&#x27;s safety tamping bar, which attracted the Prince Regent to become its patron.

The first lifeboat in Cornwall was bought by the people of Penzance in 1803 but it was sold in 1812 due to lack of funds to keep it in operation. The pier had been extended again in 1812 and John Matthews opened a small dry dock in 1814, the first in the South West. In 1840 Nicholas Holman of St Just opened a branch of his foundry business on the quayside. These facilities proved valuable in supporting the steamships that were soon calling at the harbour in increasing numbers.

Gas lighting was introduced in 1830 and the old Market House was demolished in 1836. Its replacement, designed by W. Harris of Bristol, was completed at the top of Market Jew Street in 1838. (The name Market Jew comes from the Cornish language &quot;Marghas Yow&quot;, meaning &quot;Thursday Market&quot;, the name of a nearby village now absorbed into Marazion, to which Market Jew Street leads.) St Mary&#x27;s Church, another prominent feature of the Penzance skyline, was completed in 1836, while a Roman Catholic church was built in 1843. Another familiar building from this period is the eccentric Egyptian House in Chapel Street, built in 1830. The first part of the Promenade along the sea front dates from 1844.

====1849–1900====
After the passing of the Public Health Act (1848), Penzance was one of the first towns to petition to form a local board of health, doing so in September that year. Following a report by a government inspector in February, the Board was established in 1849 which led to many facilities to enhance public health. The report shows that most streets were macadamised or sometimes paved, and the town was lit by 121 gas lamps from October to March each year, although they were not lit when there was a full moon. Water was supplied from 6 public pumps, and there were a further 53 private wells. There were no sewage pipes at the time, waste being collected from the main streets by a refuse cart.

;Railway station
Penzance railway station, the terminus of the West Cornwall Railway, opened on 11 March 1852 on the eastern side of the harbour, although trains only ran to Redruth at first. From 25 August 1852 the line was extended to Truro, but the Cornwall Railway linking that place with Plymouth was not opened until 4 May 1859. Passengers and goods had to change trains at Truro as the West Cornwall had been built using the standard gauge, but the Cornwall Railway was built to the broad gauge. The West Cornwall Railway Act included a clause that it would be converted to broad gauge once it had been connected to another broad gauge line, but the company could not raise the funds to do so.

The line was sold to the Great Western Railway and its &quot;Associated Companies&quot; (the Bristol and Exeter Railway and South Devon Railway) on 1 January 1866. The new owners quickly converted the line to mixed gauge using three rails so that both broad and &quot;narrow&quot; trains could operate. Broad gauge goods trains started running in November that year, with through passenger trains running to London Paddington from 1 March 1867. The last broad gauge train arrived at 8.49pm on 20 May 1892, having left London Paddington at 10.15am that morning. The two locomotives, numbers 1256 and 3557, took the carriages away to Swindon Works at 9.57pm, and all trains since have been standard gauge.

The ability of the railway to carry fresh produce to distant markets such as Bristol, London and Manchester enabled local farmers and fishermen to sell more produce and at better prices. The special &quot;perishable&quot; train soon became a feature of the railway, these being fast extra goods trains carrying potatoes, broccoli or fish depending on the season. In August 1861, 1,787 tons of potatoes, 867 tons of broccoli, and 1,063 tons of fish were dispatched from the station. Fruit and flowers were also carried; the mild climate around Penzance and on the Scilly Isles meant that they were ready for market earlier and could command high prices.

The completion of the railway through Cornwall made it easier for tourists and invalids to enjoy the mild climate of Penzance. Bathing machines had been advertised for hire on the beach as early as 1823, and the town was already &quot;noted for the pleasantness of its situation, the salubrity of its air, and the beauty of its natives&quot;. The town&#x27;s first official guide book was published in 1860, and the Queen&#x27;s Hotel opened on the seafront the following year. It was so successful that it was extended in 1871 and 1908.

;Harbour
At the same time as the railway was being built more improvements were being made to the harbour, with a second pier on the eastern side of the harbour, the Albert Pier, completed in 1853 to provide even better shelter for shipping. At the same time the Old Pier was also extended, and a lighthouse was built on it (replacing an earlier light), commissioned in 1855. The lighthouse (which was originally lit by an oil lamp within a fifth-order Fresnel lens) was built by Sandys &amp; co. of Hayle and displayed a fixed red or green light, depending on the height of the tide. It remains operational, displaying a flashing sector light, which is visible up to out to sea.

The Scilly Isles Steam Navigation Company was founded in 1858 and placed in service the first steam ship on the route, &quot;SS Little Western&quot;. In 1870 the new West Cornwall Steam Ship Company joined the route, taking over the Scilly Isles Company the following year.

In 1853 the Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed one of their boats in the town, the first since 1812, and maintained a station here until 1908 when the Watson Class &quot;Elizabeth Blanche&quot; was transferred to Newlyn as the first step towards setting up Penlee Lifeboat Station. The RNLI still use a boat house built on Jennings Street near the Promenade in 1884 to promote their activities.

Penzance, with its dry dock and engineering facilities, was chosen as the western depot for Trinity House that serviced all the lighthouses and lightships from Start Point to Trevose Head. It was opened in October 1866 adjacent to the harbour and the Buoy Store became the Trinity House National Lighthouse Museum until 2005 when Trinity House closed the museum.

;Improvements

In 1875 a local newspaper described the railway station as &quot;a large dog&#x27;s house of the nastiest and draughtiest kind&quot; but a series of works improved this part of the town during the 1880s. The original railway station was rebuilt with the present buildings and train shed over the platforms (1880). The lower end of Market Jew Street was widened and a new road was built to link the station with the harbour over the Ross Swing Bridge (1881) (named after Charles Campbell Ross), allowing the construction of proper sewers beneath. A larger dry dock replaced Matthews&#x27; original facility (1880), and a floating harbour was made (1884) with lock gates to keep in the water at low tide.

Around the headland, public baths were opened on the Promenade in 1887 and the Morrab Gardens with its sub-tropical plants was opened two years later. A bandstand was added to the gardens in 1897.
===20th century===

In 1901 the town had a population of 3,088. The decennial census recorded a continuing decline in population until 1921, when just 2,616 people were recorded. The population then climbed to 4,888 (1931) then 5,545 (1951) – thus more than doubling in 30 years. It was now larger than at any time in the past. (The census boundaries changed in 1981 so these figures do not directly compare with those stated for the current population.)

A proposed electric tramway along the Promenade to Newlyn, which would have continued as a light railway to St Just, failed to gain authorisation in 1898. Instead motor buses were put into service on 31 October 1903. These linked Penzance with Marazion and were operated by the Great Western Railway, being introduced only 11 weeks after the railway&#x27;s pioneering service between Helston and the Lizard. They were considered a success, carrying 16,091 passengers by the end of the year, so were followed the next spring by further routes to Land&#x27;s End and St Just. These services developed into the First Kernow bus network that currently serves the area and is still centred on a terminus alongside Penzance railway station.

In 1912, Penzance erected its first electric street lamps and the town&#x27;s first cinema opened.

The dry dock was sold on 25 August 1904 to N. Holman and Sons Limited, the engineering business that had been trading in Penzance since 1840. New workshops would be built during the 1930s, and the facility continued to be used by the Scilly ferries and other merchant ships, as well as Trinity House, the Royal Navy and Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service. In 1951 a new vessel for the King Harry Ferry on the River Fal was launched, built on the keel of an old landing craft. A steam tug, the &quot;Primrose&quot;, was built in 1963.

Land was reclaimed beside the Albert Pier in the 1930s to allow the railway station to be enlarged at a cost of £134,000. The 1880 building was retained, but extra platforms and sidings were provided to handle more perishable goods, as well as the increasing numbers of tourists.

In 1905 a new bandstand was built on the Promenade opposite the Queen&#x27;s Hotel, and the Pavilion Theatre opened nearby in 1911, complete with a roof garden and café. Travel to Penzance was easier than ever, with the Great Western Railway introducing the &quot;Cornish Riviera Express&quot; on 1 July 1904, which left London Paddington at 10:10am and arrived in Penzance just 7 hours later, two hours faster than the previous quickest service. (In 2018 it left Paddington at 10:03am and took 5 hours and 8 minutes.) The railway promoted local tourism with postcards that were sold at its railway stations, and an annual guide book, &quot;The Cornish Riviera&quot;, in which SPB Mais described the town as &quot;a suburb of Covent Garden, and a great fishing centre ... there is always something going on in its harbour&quot;.

1923 saw a new road link the harbour area and the Promenade, and in 1933 the St. Anthony Gardens were built, followed two years later by the Jubilee Pool opposite. Tourists could now make full use of the whole seafront between Penzance and Newlyn harbours.

In the early 1990s, a bypass was built around the town.

==Transport==

===Railway===

Penzance railway station is sited at the eastern end of Market Jew Street and close to the harbour; it is the southernmost station on the UK mainland rail network. The station is the western terminus of the Cornish Main Line, which runs above the beach to Marazion; this affords passengers good views of St. Michael&#x27;s Mount and Mount&#x27;s Bay.

Services are operated by two train operating companies:
* Great Western Railway operates local services to St Erth, St Ives, Hayle, Camborne, Redruth and Truro. It provides inter-city trains to Plymouth, Exeter St Davids, Bristol Temple Meads, Reading and London Paddington. The &quot;Night Riviera&quot; train offers an overnight sleeping car service to and from Reading and London. Journey time to Plymouth is typically under 2 hours, to Bristol around 4 hours and London around 5 hours.
* CrossCountry runs a small number of services (departing in the morning, arriving in the evening) providing a service to destinations such as , , , , , and Edinburgh. The company operates a daily service from , with a journey time of over 13 hours; this is the longest direct rail service in the United Kingdom.

===Buses===
The bus and coach station is next to the railway station from where National Express operates coach services to London Victoria Coach Station (taking around 9 hours) via Heathrow Airport. Local bus services run by First Kernow connect Penzance with most major settlements in Cornwall, including Truro, St Ives, St Just, St Buryan, Land&#x27;s End and also Plymouth in Devon.

===Roads===
The A30 from London to Land&#x27;s End is a trunk road as far as the &quot;Chy-an-Mor&quot; roundabout, a mile (1.6 km) to the east of Penzance. After bypassing Penzance to the north the road continues to Land&#x27;s End mainly as a rural &quot;A route&quot;. The A30 provides a fast connection to the M5 motorway at Exeter to the north-east. The distance from Penzance to London is , with a 5 hour journey time.

===Water===

A ferry service operates between Penzance Harbour and the Isles of Scilly. &quot;The Scillonian III&quot;, carries both foot-passengers and cargo; sailing time is about 2 hours and 40 minutes.

===Air===
From 1964 to 2012, and again since 2020, Penzance Heliport offers a helicopter route to the Isles of Scilly. Until 2012, the service was run by British International, but this ended on 1 November 2012 due to rising costs and falling passenger numbers. The heliport was subsequently demolished and replaced by a supermarket. In 2020, a new heliport opened not far from the location of the previous one and offers again services to the islands of Tresco and St Mary&#x27;s (operated by Penzance Helicopters in conjunction with Sloane Helicopters). A bus service run by the Skybus Airline Service connects with Land&#x27;s End Airport for fixed wing flights (15 minutes) to the Isles of Scilly. The buses leave from the railway station, near the taxi rank.

Newquay Airport is 41 miles (66 km) away and offers flights to Gatwick, Heathrow, Dublin, Cork and many other places, including an increasing number of European destinations.

==Governance==

Penzance was an ancient borough, which became a municipal borough in 1835. Until 1934 the Municipal Borough of Penzance referred only to the town, but in 1934 the borough absorbed the nearby settlements of Newlyn, Paul and Mousehole (from Paul Urban District), Gulval (from West Penwith Rural District) and Heamoor (from Madron Urban District).

In 1974 the Penzance Borough was abolished and replaced by Penwith District Council. Initially the area of the former borough was unparished and Charter Trustees were appointed, but in 1980 the civil parish of Penzance was reformed in the unparished area, and the new parish council elected to be called Penzance Town Council. Penwith District Council was abolished in 2009, and the principal local authority in the area is now Cornwall Council. For the purposes of election to Cornwall Council the civil parish of Penzance returns 6 members representing the Penzance East Division, Penzance Central Division, Penzance Promenade Division, Heamoor and Gulval and Newlyn and Mousehole Division.

The Civil Parish of Penzance was further extended in 2004 under District of Penwith (Electoral Changes) Order 2002 to include Eastern Green, formerly part of the Ludgvan civil parish area.

Penzance Town Council does not have in place a system of political registration, so councillors do not form groups of any kind and technically act independently; however, the current political composition of the council (as of 4 May 2017) is as follows: Independent 10, Labour Party 5, Liberal Democrat 3, Green 1, Conservative 1.

Penzance also elects a mayor every year in May from the members of Penzance town council. Although mayors can have a political affiliation, as chair of the council they seek to remain independent. Though much of their time is taken up with ceremonial duties, they work closely with the Town Clerk and Cornwall Council to deliver a wide range of services and amenities for the town. The current mayor is Cllr. Stephen Reynolds.

==Economy==

The economy of Penzance has, like those of many Cornish communities, suffered from the decline of the traditional industries of fishing, mining and agriculture. Penzance now has a mixed economy consisting of light industrial, tourism and retail businesses. However, like the rest of Cornwall, housing remains comparatively expensive, wages low and unemployment high. In 2007, house prices rose 274% from 10 years prior, the fastest rise in the UK. The fishing port of Newlyn, which falls within the parish boundaries, provides some employment in the area, but has also been greatly affected by the decline in the fishing industry over the last 30 years. In the 2004 index of deprivation Penzance is listed as having 3 wards within the top 10% for employment deprivation, Penzance East (125th most deprived in England) Penzance West (200th most deprived in England), and Penzance Central (712th most deprived in England). 18–31% of households in the parish are described as &quot;poor households&quot;. Penzance East also has one of the highest unemployment rates in Cornwall, stated as 15.4%.

===Mining===
Following Sir Humphry Davy&#x27;s contribution to the mining industry, the Miners&#x27; Association began mining classes in Penzance. As mining in the area became more complex, the Penzance Mining and Science School was founded in 1890. The school continued to teach mining until 1910, when it was amalgamated with Camborne and Redruth Mining School forming the School of Metalliferous Mining in Camborne, which is now known as the Camborne School of Mines. This institution has now moved to the Combined Universities in Cornwall campus at Tremough, Falmouth. From 1663, Penzance was a coinage town, responsible for the collection of tin taxation on behalf of the Duchy of Cornwall; it held this status for 176 years. According to William Pryce in his 1778 book &quot;Mineralogia Cornubiensis&quot;, Penzance coined more tin than the towns of Liskeard, Lostwithiel and Helston put together.

Penzance also had its own submarine mine situated off the coast of the town next to the area known as Wherrytown. The mine, known as Wheal Wherry Mine, was worked from 1778 to 1798 and again from 1836 to 1840. Founded by &quot;a poor 57 year old miner&quot; named Thomas Curtis, the mine was said to be &quot;very rich at depth&quot; and was connected to the shore by a wooden bridge; the ore was transported by wherry boat. The mine suffered considerable damage in 1798 when an American ship broke anchor off nearby Newlyn and smashed into the bridge and head gear. Later attempts at mining were not as profitable.

During the 19th century and until 1912, Penzance had the largest tin smelting house in Cornwall, operated by the Bolitho family. The smelting works were situated at Chyandour. As a consequence of this concentration of mining wealth, Penzance became a centre for commercial banking. The Bolitho Bank (now part of Barclays Bank) and the Penzance Bank were two of the largest, although the latter collapsed in 1896.

==Main sights==

Large sections of Penzance are classified as ″conservation areas″ under the Penwith local plan and are subject to special planning laws. The current conservation area forms most of the core of the town of Penzance and the historic harbour areas of Newlyn and Mousehole. A number of Georgian and Regency buildings are present in the town. However, the majority of developments in the town centre itself are of mixed date, including several 20th-century buildings – one of which, the former Pearl Assurance building (now the Tremenheere Wetherspoon&#x27;s pub), was subject to comment by Sir John Betjeman who wrote, in 1963:
&quot;Penzance has done much to destroy its attractive character. The older houses in the narrow centre round the market hall have been pulled down and third-rate commercial &#x27;contemporary&#x27;, of which the Pearl Assurance building is a nasty example, are turning it into Slough&quot;. The Market Building (1836–38) in Market Jew Street was designed by William Harris, District Surveyor for Bristol, in the Greek Revival style. It has a grand Ionic portico and is surmounted by a dome. Alterations for Lloyds Bank were carried out in 1922–25.

Penzance&#x27;s former main street Chapel Street has a number of interesting features, including the Egyptian House, the Union Hotel (including a Georgian theatre which is no longer in use) and Branwell House, where the mother and aunt of the famous Brontë sisters once lived. The Georgian theatre was built in c. 1787, closed in 1831, and is said to be where the first public announcement of Nelson&#x27;s victory at Trafalgar took place. Regency, and Georgian terraces and houses (such as Regents Square and Clarence Street) are common in some parts of the town. The nearby sub-tropical Morrab Gardens, has a large collection of tender trees and shrubs, many of which cannot be grown outdoors anywhere else in the UK. Also of interest is the seafront with its promenade and the open-air seawater Jubilee Pool (one of the oldest surviving Art Deco swimming baths in the country), built during Penzance&#x27;s heyday as a fashionable seaside resort. The pool was designed by Captain F. Latham, the Penzance Borough Engineer, and opened in 1935, the year of King George V&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. The grade II listed pool is triangular with graceful curves and is considered the best surviving example of its type, with the exception of the Saltdean Lido in Brighton. In early 2018, work began to add a geothermal section to the pool, becoming the first of its kind in the United Kingdom to use this type of technology when it eventually opens.

Penzance promenade has been destroyed in parts several times by storms. The most recent example was on 7 March 1962, when large parts of the western end of the promenade, the nearby Bedford Bolitho Gardens (now a play park) and the village of Wherrytown suffered severe damage. On the outskirts of town is Trereife House, a grade II listed Queen Anne style, manor house which now offers accommodation and hosts events.

==Geography==
Penlee Quarry which is within the boundaries of the Penzance parish is a geological SSSI.

==Climate==
Penzance has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) according to Köppen and a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cf&quot;) according to Trewartha.

==Education==

Penzance has two comprehensive schools, Mounts Bay Academy and Humphry Davy School. Post 16 education is catered for by Penwith College, founded in 1981 from the sixth form departments of the former Penzance Girls&#x27; Grammar School and the Humphry Davy Grammar School. In the Penzance parish there are 8 primary schools, including the newly created Pensans Primary School which was formed in 2006 from the former Penzance Junior School and the Lescudjack Infants School. There is also a special educational needs school within the parish boundary named Nancealverne.

Various other schools have existed in past times, including St Erbyn&#x27;s School, West Cornwall School for Girls and Bolitho School at Polwithen House. The Polwithen site was originally home to Penzance Church of England Girls&#x27; High School and later the School of St Clare (a Woodard school) whose pupils included author Rosamund Pilcher and Ethiopian Princess Aida Desta. Bolitho School closed in 2017 because too few pupils were available. The building is now being developed as a care home, named the Frances Bolitho Care Home.

==Culture==
Every June since 1991 the Golowan Festival (which includes Mazey Day) has been held in the town. The name comes from the Cornish &quot;gool&quot; (meaning feast) and &quot;Jowan&quot; (a Cornish name equivalent to the English John) - loosely translating to &#x27;Feast of St John&#x27; and marking the midsummer-eve as the vigil of John the Baptist.

Before the 1930s Penzance was the scene of large May Day celebrations, which saw local children making and using tin &#x27;May horns&#x27; and &#x27;May whistles&#x27;; a small revival of these traditions took place on 4 May 2008. The feast day of Corpus Christi was also celebrated in Penzance. The Corpus Christi fair has been a long-standing event in the town, and is currently undergoing attempts to revive it in a more traditional format.
The summer solstice was, in 1882, described as a &quot;very old custom&quot; and celebrated &quot;with all the rude revelry of heathendom&quot;. Bonfires were lit in the town centre and lines of tar barrels were swung along the streets by males and females. It was also accompanied by &quot;dancing of the roughest kind, uncouth dress and semi-disguise, sky and hand rockets, and all sorts of fireworks&quot;.

Allantide, a Cornish version of Halloween, was also a popular activity in the town. Many of these customs were recorded by local antiquarian M. A. Courtney and have influenced historical views of traditional Cornish cultural activities.

In October 2010 the first full festival of music and the arts – the Penzance Proms – was held (23–31 October).

Every December Penzance holds the Montol Festival a community arts event reviving many of the Cornish customs of Christmas, including traditional costumes, masks and guise dancing.

===Music and theatre===
Penzance is the home of the pirates in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. At the time the libretto was written, 1879, Penzance had become popular as a peaceful resort town, so the idea of it being overrun by pirates was amusing to contemporaries.

The Acorn Arts Centre, sited within a former Methodist chapel in Parade Street, provides a mixture of theatre, film, dance music and cabaret and is partially public funded. The Savoy is an independent cinema in Causewayhead which opened in 1912 and was originally named the Victoria Hall Music Hall. The Savoy is one of the locations of performances sponsored by the Penwith Film Society (an arts cinema society based in the Penwith area), it is reputedly the oldest continuously used cinema in Britain. Prior to the Second World War, Penzance was also home to a further three cinemas and at least two theatres, one of which, the Pavilion Theatre, is now home to an amusement arcade.

The 2016 pop single by indie group The Hit Parade &quot;From Paddington to Penzance&quot;, takes as its subject a relationship that was formed on the railway line from London to Cornwall that terminates in Penzance.

===Art galleries===
Penzance is home to the new Newlyn Art Gallery establishment &quot;The Exchange&quot; which opened in 2007. Penlee House, an art gallery and museum notable for its collection of paintings by members of the Newlyn School. It was one of the former homes of the Branwell family. Within Penzance town centre there are a growing number of commercial art galleries.

===Religion===
As in other Cornish towns and villages Methodism was historically the predominant Christian denomination. Prior to the 1980s Penzance had six Methodist churches, but this number has now been reduced to two, Chapel Street and High Street. There are Methodist churches in most of the surrounding villages including Newlyn&#x27;s Trinity Methodist which operates &quot;The Centre&quot;, a busy multi-use church and community facility. Penzance is also home to a The Salvation Army citadel, a Roman Catholic church, two Church of England parish churches (formerly three), a Christadelphian meeting hall, two Evangelical independent churches, the Penwith pagan moot, an independent Baptist church and a Buddhist meditation group.
St Mary&#x27;s Church was built in 1832–35, St Paul&#x27;s (now closed) in 1843 and St John&#x27;s in 1881. Penzance was formerly in the parish of Madron but St Mary&#x27;s parish was established in 1871 and St Paul&#x27;s in 1869. Two medieval chapels (&quot;see above&quot;, History) are known to have existed before the Reformation. St Mary&#x27;s chapel was consecrated in 1680 but was in existence three hundred years earlier and the licensing of it in 1379 is recorded. The chaplain&#x27;s stipend was £4 p.a. from the manor of Alverton. In 1549 its endowments were seized by the Crown though the burgesses made representations that they should not be. Thomas Lamplugh Bishop of Exeter by much cajolery induced the mayor and burgesses to consent to consecration of the chapel in 1680. The curate then had a stipend of £5 p.a.

Arthur Langdon (1896) described a Cornish cross in front of the Market House. This cross stood in the Green Market until 1829 when it was removed to a house in North Street (Causewayhead) close to its original position. About 1868 it was moved again to the western end of the Market House. It is ornamented on the front and the sides. On the back there is said to be an inscription: PCMBUNT/QUICUMQ/VENIENT//COP/PIO/UM//O/+/X (described in 1850). It is now at Penlee House.

===Sport===
Penzance is the home of Cornwall&#x27;s most successful rugby teams, the Cornish Pirates (Penzance &amp; Newlyn RFC). The Championship side moved to Truro in 2005 and was renamed the Cornish Pirates in a bid to improve attendances and reach the Premiership. In 2006 the side moved again, this time to the home ground of Camborne Rugby Club, before returning to Penzance in 2010 to play, once more, at the Mennaye Field. The club has twice reached the play-off final for promotion to the top tier of English rugby in seasons 2010–11 and 2011–12. Penzance was the home of Mounts Bay RFC, founded in 1999, originally as a team for local players who could not play for the professional Cornish Pirates. They won promotion seven times in eight seasons to reach the third tier of English rugby before folding in 2009 due to financial problems. The Pirates Amateurs are part of the Cornish Pirates and play in the lower levels of the league system. They ended their first season in second place in the Tribute Cornwall One and won promotion to Tribute Cornwall/Devon for 2011–12 season, where they continue to play. They also won the Cornwall Clubs Cup in 2010–11.

Penzance A.F.C. were relegated from the South West Peninsula League Premier Division following the 2012–13 season and now play in Division One West. The club was one of the founding members of the Cornwall County Football Association and the first winners of the Cornwall Senior Cup in 1892–93. Penzance have won the Senior Cup on ten occasions, the last in the 1980–81 campaign.

Former England and Surrey cricketer Jack Richards (born Clifton James Richards) was born in Penzance. He played eight test matches and was the wicket keeper during England&#x27;s 1986 Ashes win in Australia. He learnt his cricket with the Humphry Davy Grammar School and Penzance Cricket Club. The cricket club was founded in 1829 and are Cornwall&#x27;s most successful club having been champions on 23 occasions and have had more players play for Cornwall than any other club. The club currently plays in the top tier of the Cornwall Cricket League.

Penzance Wheelers, Britain&#x27;s most south-westerly cycling club was founded in the 1930s. Their most famous member is Tom Southam who represented Great Britain in five World Championships. Penzance Wheelers predecessors was the Penzance Bicycle Club who were in existence in 1880 and, for example, on 30 April had a run to St Just, returning via Trewellard and Pendeen. Mount&#x27;s Bay Harriers, a triathlon and running club founded in 2005 are based at Mount&#x27;s Bay School, Heamoor. Athletes from the club participate at most road races and triathlons in Cornwall as well as many further afield. Other sporting clubs and organisations include Penzance Hockey Club, with male and female teams, based at the Penzance Astro Park, Penzance Tennis Club at Penlee Park and lawn bowling at Penzance Bowling Club and Penlee (Newlyn) Bowling Club.

The Mini Transat 6.50 (now the Transit 6.50) transatlantic yacht race started from Penzance (hosted by Penzance Sailing Club) from its conception in 1977 to the fourth edition of the race in 1983.

====Cornish wrestling====
Penzance has been a major centre for Cornish wrestling for centuries. Places where tournaments were held include:
the Western Green,
the Pentreath &amp; Co&#x27;s Brewery,
the Folly,
Penzance football club, St Just Road, Alverton,
the field at Treneere Manor,
the field behind the Golden Lion inn in the Market-place,
St Clare Sports Ground,
St Johyn&#x27;s Hall,
Mennaye Rugby Field,
Ponsandane and
Trereife House.

The oldest Cornish wrestling champion we know of was Stanton, who became the Cornish wrestling champion of Cornwall at a tournament in Penzance, in the fifteenth century. It is said that the wrestler was named this after chants at the tournament of &quot;Stand-to-un, boy!&quot;

W Sampson, originally from Penzance, was Cornish wrestling champion of Toronto in 1907.

Earnest Small, from Penzance, was West of England champion in 1906. He was Cornish champion in 1906 defeating Sidney and Reuben Chapman. He defeated Ahmed Madrali.

===Media===
The local newspaper is &quot;The Cornishman&quot;, published weekly. &quot;Outback&quot;, a lesbian newsletter, was self-published in Penzance between 1996 and 2008.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country.

The local radio stations are BBC Radio Cornwall on 103.9 MHz FM and Coast FM (formerly Penwith Radio), a community radio station which is based in the town, and broadcasts on 96.5 and 97.2 MHz FM. There are two ILR stations for Cornwall: Pirate FM can be received in Penzance on 102.8 MHz FM, and Heart West on 107.0 MHz FM.

===Folklore===
When the area between Marazion and Penzance was mainly marsh, people tended to avoid the Eastern Green because of the &quot;White Lady&quot;. She would jump onto a horse (already with rider) and ride pillion as far as the Red River, Chyandour (not the Red River at Marazion). Her identity and reasons for haunting are unknown. Mr William Richards of Chapel Street is reputed to be the last person to have seen her.

==Cornish language==
Passengers using the station are greeted with a bilingual sign in both Cornish and English.
==Notable residents past and present==
Penzance has been home to numerous persons of note, including actress Thandiwe Newton, model Jean Shrimpton and cricketer Jack Richards. Penzance was the birthplace of Maria Branwell, mother of three famous novelists – Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë and Anne Brontë.

===Sir Humphry Davy===

Penzance was the birthplace of the chemist Sir Humphry Davy. He was President of the Royal Society; inventor of the process of electrolysis; the first person to isolate sodium; the first to discover nitrous oxide; and joint discoverer, with Michael Faraday, that diamonds are made of pure carbon. Today he is possibly best known as the inventor of the Miner&#x27;s Safety Lamp, or Davy lamp. There is a statue of Davy at the top of Market Jew Street, near the house in which he was born. One of Penzance&#x27;s secondary schools is also named after the scientist, and runs as a music and maths community college. Robert Dunkin, a Penzance saddler and maker of scientific instruments, taught Davy the fundamental principles of practical science.

==Twinning==
Penzance is twinned with the following towns:
* Concarneau, Brittany, France
* Bendigo, Victoria, Australia
* Nevada City, California, United States
* Cuxhaven, Germany. From 1967 to 1974 Penzance was twinned with Cuxhaven, though between 1974 and 2009 this twinning arrangement was passed to the now defunct Penwith District Council. As of April 2009, the arrangement was reinstated.

==Freedom of the Town==
The following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Town of Penzance.


===Individuals===
* 25 April 1958: Sir Edward Bolitho, Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall 1936–1962.

<text>Stefan Kisielewski (7 March 1911 in Warsaw – 27 September 1991 in Warsaw, Poland), nicknames Kisiel, Julia Hołyńska, Teodor Klon, Tomasz Staliński, was a Polish writer, publicist, composer and politician, and one of the members of Znak, one of the founders of the Unia Polityki Realnej, the Polish libertarian and conservative political party.

==Biography==
Kisielewski was born to a Polish father Zygmunt Kisielewski and a Jewish mother Salomea Szapiro.

In 1927 he entered the State Conservatory of Music in Warsaw, where he received three diplomas: in theory (1934, under Kazimierz Sikorski), in composition (1937, also under K. Sikorski) and in pedagogical piano (1937, under Jerzy Lefeld). He also studied Polish literature and philosophy at Warsaw University and completed his composition studies in Paris, in the years 1938–39.

As a composer, Kisielewski remained firmly rooted in French neo-classicism, although his writings supported contemporary musical trends in Poland more broadly .

His writing and political thought were generally marked by pragmatism and support for liberalism.

In 1964 he was one of the signatories of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture. In 1968, for criticizing censorship in communist Poland (at the meeting of the Polish Writers&#x27; Union he used the designation &#x27;dyktatura ciemniaków&#x27; – &#x27;a dictatorship of dunces&#x27; – which became famous in Poland), he was forbidden to publish for three years. He was also beaten up by so-called &quot;unknown perpetrators&quot; (a euphemism for perpetrators of criminal acts of political violence who in all likelihood were members of the Communist secret police). In 1981 he coined the sentence &quot;It&#x27;s not a crisis, it&#x27;s a result&quot; to describe the down turn of the Polish economy at that time as a result of socialism. Another one of his famous statements was &quot;socialism heroically overcomes difficulties unknown in any other system&quot;, referring to the fact that many of the economic and social ills found under socialism were self-created.

In 1990, together with the magazine &quot;Wprost&quot;, he established the Kisiel Prize.

<text>Attleborough is a market town and civil parish located on the A11 between Norwich and Thetford in Norfolk, England. The parish is in the district of Breckland and has an area of .

The 2001 Census recorded the town as having a population of 9,702 distributed between 4,185 households, increasing to a population of 10,482 in 4,481 households in the 2011 Census.
11,232 Population [2021] – Census

Attleborough is in the Mid-Norfolk constituency of the UK Parliament, represented since the 2010 general election by the Conservative MP George Freeman.

Attleborough railway station provides a main line rail service to both Norwich and Cambridge.

==History==
The Anglo-Saxon foundation of the settlement is unrecorded. A popular theory of the town&#x27;s origin makes it a foundation of an &quot;Atlinge&quot;, and certainly &quot;burgh&quot; (or &quot;burh&quot;) indicates that it was fortified at an early date. According to the mid-12th century hagiographer of Saint Edmund, Geoffrey of Wells, Athla was the founder of the Ancient and royal town of Attleborough in Norfolk. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it is referred to as &quot;Attleburc&quot;.

After the Danes swept across Norfolk and seized Thetford, it is believed that the Saxons rallied their forces at Attleborough and probably threw up some form of protection. Although the Saxons put up a vigorous resistance, they eventually capitulated to the Danes and during the time of Edward the Confessor, powerful Danish families like Toradre and Turkill controlled local manors. If local records are correct, nothing but disaster was brought to Attleborough by the Danes, and it took the coming of William the Conqueror to restore some sense of well-being to the area.

Turkill relinquished his hold on the area to the Mortimer family towards the end of William&#x27;s reign, and they governed Attleborough for more than three centuries. In the 14th century the Mortimer family founded the Chapel of the Holy Cross (being the south transept of Attleborough Church), about a century later, a Sir Robert de Mortimer founded the College of the Holy Cross, and later was added the nave and aisles, to accommodate the congregation.

Following Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries the building was virtually destroyed by Robert Radcliffe, Lord Fitz Walter, Earl of Sussex, and material from the building was used for making up the road between Attleborough and Old Buckenham. However, this left Attleborough Church with a tower at the east end.

A great part of the town was destroyed by fire in 1559. It was during that period that the Griffin Hotel was built, and it was in the cellars of the Griffin that prisoners on their way to the March Assizes in Thetford were confined overnight, tethered by chains to rings in the wall.
The arrival of the prisoners aroused a great deal of public interest, and eventually traders set up a fair whenever they came. This became known as Attleborough Rogues Fair and was held on the market place on the last Thursday in March. Also on the market place festivities took place on Midsummer Day, when the annual guild was held. It appears that there has been the right to hold a weekly Thursday market in the town since 1285. A weekly market is still held and has recently (in 2004) returned to Queen&#x27;s Square where it is presumed the market was originally held.

The first turnpike road in England is reputed to have been created here at the end of the 17th century, Acts of Parliament were passed in 1696 and 1709, &quot;For the repairing of the highway between Wymondham and Attleborough, in the County of Norfolk, and for including therein the road from Wymondham to Hethersett&quot;.

The first national census of 1801 listed the population of Attleborough as 1,333. By 1845 Attleborough certainly dominated the surrounding parishes with a population of nearly 2,000, and in that year the railway (Norwich to Brandon) arrived.

The town supported six hostelries: The Griffin – the oldest, the Angel, the Bear, the Cock, the Crown and the White Horse. The Griffin, the Bear and the Cock still operate but the Crown is now a youth centre and the Angel is a building society branch office. Nothing is known of the fate of the White Horse after 1904, although the White Horse building still exists as a private house. There are currently two more public houses: The London Tavern and the Mulberry Tree, which is also a restaurant. At the centre of the town is Queens Square, at one time referred to as Market Hill.

In 1863 a corn exchange was built in the High Street owned by a company of local farmers and in 1896 the Gaymer&#x27;s cider-making plant was built on the south side of the railway and soon became established as the largest employer in the town. The factory has now closed for cider-making, which has moved to Shepton Mallet in Somerset, but it has since re-opened as a chicken processing plant, and the corn exchange is now a local Indian restaurant.

The First World War affected Attleborough probably for no better or worse than many similar small towns. Five hundred and fifty men joined the armed forces and 96 did not return.

The 1920s saw continuing growth as a market centre, held on a Thursday, the stalls spread along the pavements of Church Street and in an open area by the Angel Hotel opposite the Griffin Inn. It was the turkey sales which made the town a thriving market centre in the 1930s, and thousands were sold each year on Michaelmas Day. Local employment still largely revolved round Gaymer&#x27;s cider works.

Well into the &#x27;30s lighting was by oil lamps, then came the building of the gas works in Queens Road (since demolished, although the Gas Keeper&#x27;s House is still there). Gradually gas was piped into homes, but it was a slow process.

In the early 1930s the Corn Hall was sold and became a cinema, reaching its heyday in the early &#x27;40s.

During 1939 the old post office was sold and it became the Doric Restaurant in Queens Square. It is now the town hall. The new post office was built in Exchange Street.

There were two local airfields during the Second World War, one at Deopham Green (Station 142) and one at Old Buckenham (Station 144).

Structurally the town changed little during the 1950s and there were no great leaps in population growth, other than the arrival of the notorious London gangsters, the Kray twins, who took over a local hostelry. The 1960s were different, the overspill programme and new town development brought new families into south Norfolk. Attleborough had to make decisions for the future and new development zones were designated.

The first estate programme began with the building of the council-owned Cyprus Estate, which has since been complemented by other private housing schemes such as Fairfields and Ollands built mainly in the 1970s, and a large estate on the south side of the town in the 1990s. The traditional traffic route along the A11 trunk road became a bottleneck as it ran both ways along High Street and Church Street, thus in the 1970s a one-way system was opened channelling traffic around the natural ring road surrounding the church. The volume of traffic continued to increase making that change obsolete so the Attleborough bypass was opened in 1984. The bypass was widened and completed in 2007, removing the only single-lane section of the A11 between Thetford and Norwich.

==Churches==

The parish church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is partly Norman and partly 14th century. The east end of the church is Norman and the nave is late 14th century. In 1368 the College of Holy Cross was founded in the Norman part and at that time the nave was built for the use of the parish. The remarkable rood screen has the loft intact for its full width but has been often restored. It is one of the finest rood screens in Norfolk and above are frescoes of ca. 1500, since much-mutilated.

The Eastern Baptist Association meets at the Baptist church in Leys Lane. The Attleborough Methodist church in London Road has stopped holding normal services but still provides rooms to hire for community use. This building was designed by the architect Augustus Scott in Gothic Revival style, and in 1913 replaced the Primitive Methodist building in Chapel Road, since demolished.

==Educational facilities==
There are three schools in the town: Attleborough Academy, Rosecroft Primary School on London Road and Attleborough Primary School on Besthorpe Road. Wymondham College, a large state boarding school, is located just outside of the town.

==Industry==
Banham Poultry is based in Attleborough.

<doc id="350551" wikidata="Q1156255" url="?curid=350551" title="United States national missile defense">
<text>National missile defense (NMD) refers to the nationwide antimissile program the United States has had under development since the 1990s. After the renaming in 2002, the term now refers to the entire program, not just the ground-based interceptors and associated facilities.

Other elements that could potentially be integrated into NMD include anti-ballistic missiles, or sea-based, space-based, laser, and high altitude missile systems. The NMD program is limited in scope and designed to counter a relatively small ICBM attack from a less sophisticated adversary. Unlike the earlier Strategic Defense Initiative program, it is not designed to be a robust shield against a large attack from a technically sophisticated adversary.

==Definitions==

The term &quot;national missile defense&quot; has several meanings:

* (Most common, but now deprecated:) U.S. National Missile Defense, the limited &quot;ground-based&quot; nationwide antimissile system in development since the 1990s. In 2002 this system was renamed to Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), to differentiate it from other missile defense programs, such as space-based, sea-based, laser, robotic, or high-altitude intercept programs. As of 2006, the GMD system is operational with limited capability. GMD is designed to intercept a small number of nuclear-armed ICBMs in the mid-course phase, using Ground-based interceptor missiles (GBIs) launched from within the United States in Alaska and California. GMD uses non-nuclear GBIs with a kinetic warhead. Other components of the national missile defense are listed below.
* Any national ICBM defense by any country, past or present. The U.S. Sentinel program was a planned national missile defense during the 1960s, but was never deployed. Elements of Sentinel were actually deployed briefly as the Safeguard Program, although it wasn&#x27;t national in scope. The Russian A-135 anti-ballistic missile system is currently operational only around the city of Moscow, the national capital, and is far from being national in scope in Russia.
* Any national missile defense (against any missile type) by any country. Israel currently has a national missile defense against short and medium-range missiles using their Arrow missile system.

See trajectory phase for the types of anti-ballistic missiles, the advantages and the disadvantages of each implementation type. The role of defense against nuclear missiles has been a heated military and political topic for several decades. (See also nuclear strategy, Missile Defense Agency, and anti-ballistic missile.) But missile defense against a known ballistic missile trajectory has to be rethought in the face of a maneuverable threat (such as a hypersonic glide vehicle, which still has yet to be realized and proven, as of 2018). See Hypersonic flight § Hypersonic weapons development, and Hypersonic glide phase interceptor (GPI) (2021).

==History of national missile defense systems==
When the United States Air Force was split from the United States Army in 1947, the Army retained the role of ground based air defenses that would evolve into National missile defense. The Army retained the lead role in this area until the success of the Aegis system shifted the focus to the United States Navy in the 21st century.

===Nike-Zeus===
In the 1950s, a series of anti-aircraft missiles were developed as part of Project Nike. The latest in the series, Nike-Zeus, offered extremely long-range interception and very high performance. In the late 1950s, the program investigated the use of Nike-Zeus missiles as interceptors against Soviet ICBMs. A Nike warhead would be detonated at high altitudes (over 100 km, or 60 statute miles) above the polar regions in the near vicinity of an incoming Soviet missile.

The problem of how to quickly identify and track incoming missiles proved intractable, especially in light of easily envisioned countermeasures such as decoys and chaff. At the same time, the need for a high-performance anti-aircraft weapon was also seriously eroded by the obvious evolution of the Soviet nuclear force to one based almost entirely on ICBMs. The Nike-Zeus project was canceled in 1961.

===Project Defender===
The Nike-Zeus use of nuclear warheads was necessary given the available missile technology. However, it had significant technical limitations such as blinding defensive radars to subsequent missiles. Also, exploding nuclear warheads over friendly territory (albeit in space) was not ideal. In the 1960s Project Defender and the Ballistic Missile Boost Intercept (BAMBI) concept replaced land-launched Nike missiles with missiles to be launched from satellite platforms orbiting directly above the USSR. Instead of nuclear warheads, the BAMBI missiles would deploy huge wire meshes designed to disable Soviet ICBMs in their early launch phase (the &quot;boost phase&quot;). No solution to the problem of how to protect the proposed satellite platforms against attack was found, however, and the program was canceled in 1968.

===Sentinel Program===

In 1967, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara announced the Sentinel Program, providing a defense against attack for most of the continental United States. The system consisted of a long range Spartan missile, the short range Sprint missile, and associated radar and computer system. However, U.S. military and political strategists recognized several problems with the system:
* Deployment of even a limited defensive ABM system might invite a preemptive nuclear attack before it could be implemented
* Deploying ABM systems would likely invite another expensive arms race for defensive systems, in addition to maintaining existing offensive expenditures
* Then-current technology did not permit a thorough defense against a sophisticated attack
* Defended coverage area was very limited due to the short range of the missiles used
* Use of nuclear warheads on antimissile interceptors would degrade capability of defensive radar, thus possibly rendering defense ineffective after the first few interceptions
* Political and public concern about detonating defensive nuclear warheads over friendly territory
* An ICBM defense could jeopardize the Mutual Assured Destruction concept, thus being a destabilizing influence

===Safeguard Program===


In 1969 Sentinel was renamed &#x27;Safeguard&#x27;. It was from then on dedicated to the protection of some of the U.S. ICBM-silo areas from attack, promoting their ability to mount a retaliatory missile attack. Safeguard used the same Spartan and Sprint missiles, and the same radar technology as Sentinel. Safeguard solved some problems of Sentinel:

* It was less expensive to develop due to its limited geographic coverage and fewer required missiles.
* It avoided a lot of hazards to the public of defensive nuclear warheads detonated in the atmosphere nearby, since the Safeguard system was located in and near sparsely populated areas of the Dakotas, Montana, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.
* It provided better interception probabilities due to dense coverage by the shorter-range Sprint missiles, which were unable to cover the entire defended area under the larger and earlier proposed Sentinel program.

However Safeguard still retained several of the previously listed political and military problems.

===ABM treaty===
These above issues drove the United States and the USSR to sign the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. Under the ABM treaty and the 1974 revision of it, each country was allowed to deploy only two ABM systems with only 100 interceptors each - one to protect the national command authority or capitol, the other to protect a deterrent force such as a missile field. The Soviets deployed a system named the A-35 &quot;Galosh&quot; missile system, and it was deployed to protect Moscow, its capital city. The U.S. deployed the Safeguard system to defend the ICBM launch sites around the Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, in 1975. The American Safeguard system was only briefly operational (for a matter of several months). The Soviet system (now called A-135) has been improved over the decades, and it is still operational around Moscow.

===Homing Overlay Experiment===
Given concerns about the previous programs using nuclear armed interceptors, in the 1980s the U.S. Army began studies about the feasibility of hit-to-kill vehicles, where an interceptor missile would destroy an incoming ballistic missile just by colliding with it, the so-called &quot;Kinetic Kill Vehicles&quot;, or KKV.

The first program which actually tested a hit-to-kill missile interceptor was the Army&#x27;s Homing Overlay Experiment. &quot;Overlay&quot; was the Army&#x27;s term for exo-atmospheric interceptions, which would have to declutter any decoys, &quot;underlay&quot; was their term for high-altitude interceptions within the atmosphere. The KKV was equipped with an infrared seeker, guidance electronics and a propulsion system. Once in space, the KKV extended a diameter structure similar to an umbrella skeleton to enhance its effective cross section. This device would destroy the ICBM reentry vehicle on collision. After test failures with the first three flight tests, the fourth and final test on 10 June 1984 was successful, intercepting the Minuteman RV with a closing speed of about at an altitude of more than .

===Strategic Defense Initiative===

On 23 March 1983, President Ronald Reagan announced a new national missile defense program formally called the Strategic Defense Initiative but soon nicknamed &quot;Star Wars&quot; by detractors. President Reagan&#x27;s stated goal was not just to protect the U.S. and its allies, but to also provide the completed system to the USSR, thus ending the threat of nuclear war for all parties. SDI was technically very ambitious and economically very expensive. It would have included many space-based laser battle stations and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites designed to intercept hostile ICBMs in space, along with very sophisticated command and control systems. Unlike the previous Sentinel program, the goal was to totally defend against a robust, all out nuclear attack by the USSR.

A partisan debate ensued in Congress, with Democrats questioning the feasibility and strategic wisdom of such a program, while Republicans talked about its strategic necessity and provided a number of technical experts who argued that it was in fact feasible (including Manhattan Project physicist Edward Teller). Advocates of SDI prevailed and funding was initiated in fiscal year 1984.

===Withdrawal from ABM Treaty===
In December 1999, the United Nations General Assembly approved a resolution aimed at pressing the United States to abandon its plans to build an anti-missile missile defense system. Voting against the draft, along with the United States, were three other countries, Albania, Israel, and the Federated States of Micronesia. Thirteen of the 15 members of the European Union abstained, and France and Ireland voted in favor of this resolution. The resolution called for continued efforts to strengthen and preserve the treaty. On 14 June 2002, the United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty. On the following day, Russia responded by withdrawing from START II treaty (intended to ban MIRV ICBMs).

==Current NMD program==
===Goals===

In the 1990s and early 21st century, the stated mission of NMD has changed to the more modest goal of preventing the United States from being subject to nuclear blackmail or nuclear terrorism by a so-called rogue state. The feasibility of this more limited goal remains somewhat controversial. Under President Bill Clinton some testing continued, but the project received little funding despite Clinton&#x27;s supportive remarks on 5 September 2000 that &quot;such a system, if it worked properly, could give us an extra dimension of insurance in a world where proliferation has complicated the task of preserving peace.&quot;

The system is administered by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). There are several other agencies and military commands which play a role, such as the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command and Space Delta 4.

MDA and the Space Development Agency (SDA) are currently developing elements of a hypersonic missile defense system to defend against hypersonic weapons; these elements include the tracking and transport layers of the National Defense Space Architecture (NDSA) and various interceptor programs, although the maneuverability and low flight altitudes of hypersonic weapons are expected to pose challenges. MDA&#x27;s Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) is expected to be able to defend against hypersonic missiles by the mid- to late-2020s. DARPA&#x27;s Glide Breaker program seeks to equip a vehicle to precisely target hypersonic missiles at long range. Analysts continue to debate the feasibility, effectiveness, and practicality of hypersonic weapons defense.

===Components===
The current NMD system consists of several components.

====Glide phase interceptors (GPIs)====
Glide phase interceptors (GPIs) are missiles designed to intercept hypersonic vehicles in flight.

====Ground-based interceptor missiles====
One major component is Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), consisting of ground-based interceptor (GBI) missiles and radar in the United States in Alaska, which would intercept incoming warheads in space. Currently some GBI missiles are located at Vandenberg SFB[Space Force Base] in California. These GBIs can be augmented by mid-course SM-3 interceptors fired from Navy ships. About ten interceptor missiles were operational as of 2006. In 2014, the Missile Defense Agency had 30 operational GBIs, with 14 additional ground-based interceptors requested for 2017 deployment, in the Fiscal Year 2016 budget.

Officially, the final deployment goal is the &quot;C3&quot; phase, intended to counter tens of complex warheads from two GMD locations utilizing 200 ABMs &quot;or more&quot;. The system design permits further expansion and upgrades beyond the C3 level.

====Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System====
A major component is a ship-based system called the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. This was given major new importance by President Obama in September 2009, when he announced plans to scrap the plans for a missile defense site in Poland, in favor of missile defense systems located on US Navy warships. On 18 September 2009, Russian Prime Minister Putin welcomed Obama&#x27;s plans for missile defense scrapping sites at Russia&#x27;s doorstep.

In 2009, several US Navy ships were fitted with SM-3 missiles to serve this function, complementing the Patriot systems already deployed by American units. Also, warships of Japan and Australia have been given weapons and technology to enable them to participate in the American defense plan as well.

On 12 November 2009, the Missile Defense Agency announced that six additional US Navy destroyers would be upgraded to participate in the program. In fiscal 2012, , , and were upgraded. , and were to be upgraded in fiscal 2013. The goal of the program was to have 21 ships upgraded by the end of 2010; 24 in 2012; and 27 around 2013.

All ships equipped with the Aegis combat system possess the SM-2 surface-to-air missile which, through recent upgrades, has terminal stage ballistic missile defense capabilities.

====Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense====
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) is a program of the US Army, utilizing ground-based interceptor missiles which can intercept missiles in the upper part of the atmosphere and outside the atmosphere. THAAD has been deployed in Guam, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea and most recently Israel.

====Airborne systems====
Several airborne systems are being examined, which would then be utilized by the US Air Force. One major object of study is a boost-phase defense, meaning a system to intercept missiles while they are in their boost phase. One potential system for this use would be an airborne laser, which was tested on the Boeing YAL-1 and was later cancelled. Other ideas are also being studied.

As of 2009, the only anti-ballistic missile defense system with a boost-phase capability is the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. There are several benefits to a sea-based boost-phase system, as it is fully mobile and has greater security by operating in international waters.

====Shorter-range anti-ballistic missiles====
Three shorter range tactical anti-ballistic missile systems are currently operational: the U.S. Army Patriot, U.S. Navy Aegis combat system/SM-2 missile, and the Israeli Arrow missile. In general short-range tactical ABMs cannot intercept ICBMs, even if within range (Arrow-3 can intercept ICBMs). The tactical ABM radar and performance characteristics do not allow it, as an incoming ICBM warhead moves much faster than a tactical missile warhead. However, the better-performance Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile could be upgraded to intercept ICBMs. The SM-3 missile has some capability against ICBMs, as demonstrated by the November 2020 successful interception of an ICBM-class target missile.

Latest versions of the U.S. Hawk missile have a limited capability against tactical ballistic missiles, but is not usually described as an ABM. Similar claims have been made about the Russian long-range surface-to-air S-300 and S-400 series.

====Multilateral and international participation====
Several aspects of the defense program have either sought or achieved participation and assistance from other nations. Several foreign navies are participating in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense, including Japan and Australia. Also, the United States has considered establishing radar sites and missile sites in other nations as part of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense. A missile defense site in Poland received much media attention when it was cancelled in favor of the Aegis BMD. A radar site in the United Kingdom is being upgraded, and another one is being built in Greenland. Other countries have contributed technological developments and various locations.

Taiwan has indicated that it is willing to host national missile defense radars to be tied into the American system, but is unwilling to pay for any further cost overruns in the systems.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported on 17 July 2012, that the Pentagon is building a missile-defense radar station at a secret site in Qatar. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; report was later confirmed by an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 8 August 2012, which stated that U.S. officials disclosed that a high-resolution, X-band missile defense radar would be located in Qatar. The radar site in Qatar will complete the backbone of a system designed to defend U.S. interests and allies such as Israel and European nations against Iranian rockets, officials told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The Pentagon chose to place the new radar site in Qatar because it is home to the largest U.S. military air base in the region, Al Udeid Air Base, analysts said. The radar base in Qatar is slated to house a powerful AN/TPY-2 radar, also known as an X-Band radar, and supplement two similar arrays already in place in Israel&#x27;s Negev Desert and in central Turkey, officials said. Together, the three radar sites form an arc that U.S. officials say can detect missile launches from northern, western and southern Iran. Those sites will enable U.S. officials and allied militaries to track missiles launched from deep inside Iran, which has an arsenal of missiles capable of reaching Israel and parts of Europe. The radar installations, in turn, are being linked to missile-interceptor batteries throughout the region and to U.S. ships with high-altitude interceptor rockets. The X-Band radar provides images that can be used to pinpoint rockets in flight.

U.S. official also stated that the U.S. military&#x27;s Central Command, which is overseeing the buildup to counter Iran, also wants to deploy the Army&#x27;s first Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile-interceptor system, known as THAAD, to the region in the coming months.
The THAAD has its own radar, so deploying it separately from the X-Bands provides even more coverage and increases the system&#x27;s accuracy, officials said. The X-Band radar and the THAAD will provide an &quot;extra layer of defense,&quot; supplementing Patriot batteries that are used to counter lower-altitude rockets, said Riki Ellison, chairman of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.

On 23 August 2012, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the U.S. is planning a major expansion of missile defenses in Asia. According to American officials this move is designed to contain threats from North Korea, but one that could also be used to counter China&#x27;s military. The planned buildup is part of a defensive array that could cover large swaths of Asia, with a new radar in southern Japan and possibly another in Southeast Asia tied to missile-defense ships and land-based interceptors.

US Defence officials told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that the core of the new anti-missile shield would be a powerful early-warning radar, known as an X-Band, sited on a southern Japanese island. Discussions between Japan and the United States are currently underway. The new X-Band would join an existing radar that was installed in northern Japan in 2006 and a third X-Band could be placed in South East Asia. The resulting radar arc would cover North Korea, China and possibly even Taiwan. According to U.S. Navy officials and the Congressional Research Service the U.S. Navy has drawn up plans to expand its fleet of ballistic missile-defense-capable warships from 26 ships today to 36 by 2018. Officials said as many as 60% of those are likely to be deployed to Asia and the Pacific. In addition, the U.S. Army is considering acquiring additional Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, antimissile systems, said a senior defense official. Under current plans, the Army is building six THAADs.

In response to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, U.S. General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on 23 August 2012 that the United States are in discussions with its close ally Japan about expanding a missile defense system in Asia by positioning an early warning radar in southern Japan. Dempsey however stated that no decisions have been reached on expanding the radar. The State Department said the U.S. is taking a phased approach to missile defense in Asia, as it is in Europe and the Middle East. &quot;These are defensive systems. They don’t engage unless missiles have been fired,&quot; department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told a news conference. &quot;In the case of Asian systems, they are designed against a missile threat from North Korea. They are not directed at China.&quot; Nuland said the U.S. has broad discussions with China through military and political channels about the systems&#x27; intent.

In addition to one American X-band radar – officially known as the AN/TPY-2 – hosted by Japan the United States and Japan announced an agreement on 17 September 2012, to deploy a second, advanced missile-defense radar on Japanese territory. &quot;The purpose of this is to enhance our ability to defend Japan,&quot; U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said at a news conference. &quot;It’s also designed to help forward-deployed U.S. forces, and it also will be effective in protecting the U.S. homeland from the North Korean ballistic missile threat.&quot; In addition to detecting ballistic missiles the radars also provide the U.S. military and its allies a highly detailed view of ship traffic in the region. That capability is particularly desired by U.S. allies in the region that are engaged in territorial disputes with China over contested islands and fishing grounds.

Some U.S. officials have noted that defenses built up against North Korean missiles would also be positioned to track a Chinese ballistic missile. A land-based radar would also free the Navy to reposition its ship-based radar to other regional hot-spots, officials said. A U.S. team landed in Japan in September 2012 to discuss where the second facility will be located, according to a U.S. defense official. Officials have said they want to locate the radar, formally known as AN/TPY2, in the southern part of Japan, but not on Okinawa, where the U.S. military presence is deeply controversial. During a joint news conference in Tokyo, Panetta and Japanese Defense Minister Satoshi Morimoto said a joint U.S.-Japanese team would begin searching immediately for a site for the new radar. On 15 November 2012, Australia and the United States announced that the US military will station a powerful radar and a space telescope in Australia as part of its strategic shift towards Asia. &quot;It will give us visibility into things that are leaving the atmosphere, entering the atmosphere, really all throughout Asia&quot;, including China&#x27;s rocket and missile tests, a US defence official told reporters on condition of anonymity.

==Program planning, goals, and discussions==
On 14 October 2002, a ground based interceptor launched from the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site destroyed a mock warhead 225 km above the Pacific. The test included three decoy balloons.

On 16 December 2002 President George W. Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive 23 which outlined a plan to begin deployment of operational ballistic missile defense systems by 2004. The following day the U.S. formally requested from the UK and Denmark use of facilities in Fylingdales, England, and Thule, Greenland, respectively, as a part of the NMD program. The projected cost of the program for the years 2004 to 2009 will be $53 billion, making it the largest single line in The Pentagon&#x27;s budget.

Since 2002, the US has been in talks with Poland and other European countries over the possibility of setting up a European base to intercept long-range missiles. A site similar to the US base in Alaska would help protect the US and Europe from missiles fired from the Middle East or North Africa. Poland&#x27;s prime minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz said in November 2005 he wanted to open up the public debate on whether Poland should host such a base.

In 2002, NMD was changed to Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), to differentiate it from other missile defense programs, such as space-based, sea-based, and defense targeting the boost phase and the reentry phase (see flight phases).

On 22 July 2004, the first ground-based interceptor was deployed at Fort Greely, Alaska (). By the end of 2004, a total of six had been deployed at Ft. Greely and another two at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Two additional were installed at Ft. Greely in 2005. The system will provide &quot;rudimentary&quot; protection.

On 15 December 2004, an interceptor test in the Marshall Islands failed when the launch was aborted due to an &quot;unknown anomaly&quot; in the interceptor, 16 minutes after launch of the target from Kodiak Island, Alaska.

&quot;I don&#x27;t think that the goal was ever that we would declare it was operational. I think the goal was that there would be an operational capability by the end of 2004,&quot; Pentagon representative Larry DiRita said on 2005-01-13 at a Pentagon press conference. However, the problem is and was funding. &quot;There has been some expectation that there will be some point at which it is operational and not something else these expectations are not unknown, if Congress pours more attention and funding to this system, it can be operational relatively quick.&quot;

On 18 January 2005, the Commander, United States Strategic Command issued direction to establish the Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense (JFCC IMD). The JFCC IMD, once activated, will develop desired characteristics and capabilities for global missile defense operations and support for missile defense.

On 14 February 2005, another interceptor test failed due to a malfunction with the ground support equipment at the test range on Kwajalein Island, not with the interceptor missile itself.
On 24 February 2005, the Missile Defense Agency, testing the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, successfully intercepted a mock enemy missile. This was the first test of an operationally configured RIM-161 Standard missile 3 (SM-3) interceptor and the fifth successful test intercept using this system. On 10 November 2005, the USS &quot;Lake Erie&quot; detected, tracked, and destroyed a mock two-stage ballistic missile within two minutes of the ballistic missile launch.

On 1 September 2006, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System was successfully tested. An interceptor was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base to hit a target missile launched from Alaska, with ground support provided by a crew at Colorado Springs. This test was described by Missile Defense Agency director Lieutenant General Trey Obering as &quot;about as close as we can come to an end-to-end test of our long-range missile defense system.&quot; The target missile carried no decoys or other countermeasures.

Deployment of the Sea-based X-band Radar system is presently underway.

On 24 February 2007, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that the United States ambassador to NATO, Victoria Nuland, had written to her fellow envoys to advise them regarding the various options for missile-defense sites in Europe. She also confirmed that &quot;The United States has also been discussing with the UK further potential contributions to the system.&quot;

On 23 February 2008, the United States successfully shot down a malfunctioning American spy satellite.

The Ustka-Wicko base () of the Polish Army was mentioned as a possible site of US missile interceptors. Russia objected; its suspension of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe may be related.

Russia threatened to place short-range nuclear missiles on the Russia&#x27;s border with NATO if the United States refused to abandon plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles and a radar in Poland and the Czech Republic. In April 2007, Putin warned of a new Cold War if the Americans deployed the shield in Central Europe. Putin also said that Russia is prepared to abandon its obligations under a Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987 with the United States. In 2014 Russia announced plans to install more radar and missile defense systems across the country to counter U.S. plans for a missile defense system in Eastern Europe.

As of January 2017, the top 3 candidate sites for a proposed Eastern United States missile defense site are now New York, Michigan, and Ohio.

===Missile defense sites in Central Europe===

Previously, a controversial initiative existed for placing GMD missile defense installations in Central Europe, namely in Poland and Czech Republic. As a result of strong Russian opposition, the plan has been abandoned in favor of Aegis-class missile defense based in the Black Sea and eventually in Romania.

In February 2007, the US started formal negotiations with Poland and Czech Republic concerning placement of a site of Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System. The announced objective was to protect most of Europe from long-range missile strikes from Iran. Public opinion in both countries opposed: 57% of Poles disagreed, while 21% supported the plans; in Czech Republic it was 67% versus 15%. More than 130,000 Czechs signed a petition for a referendum about the base, which is by far the largest citizen initiative (&quot;Ne základnám&quot; – No to Bases) since the Velvet Revolution.

The Ustka-Wicko base of the Polish Army was mentioned as a possible site of 10 American interceptor missiles. Russia objected; its suspension of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe may be related. Putin warned of a possible new Cold War. Russia threatened to place short-range nuclear missiles on its border with NATO if the United States refused to abandon the plan.

A radar and tracking system site placement was agreed with the Czech Republic. After long negotiations, on 20 August 2008, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Poland&#x27;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski signed in Warsaw the &quot;Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Poland Concerning the Deployment of Ground-Based Ballistic Missile Defense Interceptors in the Territory of the Republic of Poland&quot;, a deal that would implement the missile defense system in Polish territory. Russia warned Poland that it is exposing itself to attack—even a nuclear one—by accepting U.S. missile interceptors on its soil. Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn the deputy chief of staff of Russia&#x27;s armed forces said &quot;Poland, by deploying (the system) is exposing itself to a strike – 100 percent&quot;.

In September 2009, President Barack Obama announced that plans for missile defense sites in Central Europe would be scrapped in favor of systems located on US Navy warships. On 18 September 2009, Russian Prime Minister Putin decided to welcome Obama&#x27;s plans for stationing American Aegis defense warships in the Black Sea. The deployment occurred the same month, consisting of warships equipped with the Aegis RIM-161 SM-3 missile system, which complements the Patriot missile systems already deployed by American units. 
Once USS &quot;Monterey&quot; was actually deployed to the Black Sea the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement voicing concern about the deployment.

On 4 February 2010, Romania agreed to host the SM-3 missiles starting in 2015. The missile defense system in Deveselu became operational on 18 December 2015. The BMD component in Romania underwent an upgrade in 2019; in the interim a THAAD unit, B Battery (THAAD), 62nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment, was emplaced in NSF Deveselu, Romania. Aegis Ashore was installed in Redzikowo, Poland with completion by 2022.

==Skepticism==
There has been controversy among experts about whether it is technically feasible to build an effective missile defense system and, in particular, whether the GMD would work.

An April 2000 study by the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that &quot;[a]ny country capable of deploying a long-range missile would also be able to deploy countermeasures that would defeat the planned NMD system.&quot;
Countermeasures studied in detail were bomblets containing biological or chemical agents, aluminized balloons to serve as decoys and to disguise warheads, and cooling warheads to reduce the kill vehicle&#x27;s ability to detect them.

In April 2004, a General Accounting Office report concluded that &quot;MDA does not explain some critical assumptions—such as an enemy’s type and number of decoys—underlying its performance goals.&quot; It recommended that &quot;DOD carry out independent, operationally realistic testing of each block being fielded&quot; but DOD responded that &quot;formal operational testing is not required before entry into full-rate production.&quot;

Proponents did not suggest how to discriminate between empty and warhead-enclosing balloons, for instance, but said that these &quot;simple&quot; countermeasures are actually hard to implement, and that defense technology is rapidly advancing to defeat them. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) said decoy discrimination techniques were classified, and emphasized its intention to provide future boost and terminal defense to diminish the importance of midcourse decoys. In summer 2002 MDA ceased providing detailed intercept information and declined to answer technical questions about decoys on grounds of national security.

China is developing a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), now called the DF-ZF, capable of penetrating US missile defenses. The US Department of Defense denotes this HGV as the WU-14. In response the US Army is participating in a joint program with the US Navy and US Air Force, to develop a hypersonic glide body in 2019, with test fires every six months, beginning in 2021.

==Boost-phase defense==
Boost-phase defense is the act of engaging a missile as it begins to launch, which is substantially easier due to the fact that in that moment, any ballistic missile has not deployed penetration aids. This is differentiated from ascent-phase defense, where the missile has gained substantial speed and altitude. 

In theory, this may be accomplished with any weapons system capable of airborne intercept, however in practice area defense surface to air missiles are highly desirable, as the window of opportunity is very short. For example, the American Standard Missile 2 has an effective range in excess of 70km, however according to an American Physical Society study, it must be within 40 kilometers of the launching point. This is acceptable for submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), but not likely for land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

===Boost-phase defense against solid-fueled ICBM===
Boost-phase defense is significantly more difficult against the current solid-fuel rocket ICBMs, because their boost phase is shorter. Current solid-fueled ICBMs include Russian Topol, Indian Agni-V, and Chinese DF-31 and DF-41, along with the US Minuteman and Trident.

There is no theoretical perspective for economically viable boost-phase defense against the latest solid-fueled ICBMs, no matter if it would be ground-based missiles, space-based missiles, or airborne laser (ABL).

===Boost-phase defense against older ICBMs===
A ground-based boost-phase defense might be possible, if the goals were somewhat limited: to counter older liquid-fuel propelled ICBMs, and to counter simple solid-propellant missiles launched from less challenging locations (such as North Korea).

Using orbital launchers to provide a reliable boost-phase defense against liquid-fueled ICBMs is not likely, as it was found to require at least 700 large interceptors in orbit. Using two or more interceptors per target, or countering solid fueled missiles, would require many more orbital launchers. The old Brilliant Pebbles project—although it did not apply to the boost phase—estimated the number at 4,000 smaller orbital launchers.

The airborne laser (ABL) is possibly capable of intercepting a liquid fuel missile if within from a launch point.

From 1976 he became involved in the Intercosmos and made his third and final spaceflight on an Intercosmos flight with Polish cosmonaut Mirosław Hermaszewski on Soyuz 30 in 1978.

He resigned from the cosmonaut team in 1978 to take up a position as the Assistant to the Chief of the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. In 1991 he was promoted to Chief of that facility and remained in that post until retirement in 2003.

<text>The Currie Cup is South Africa&#x27;s premier domestic rugby union competition featuring teams representing either entire provinces or substantial regions within provinces. Although it is the premier domestic competition, four South African franchises also compete in the United Rugby Championship competition, including for the &#x27;South African Shield&#x27;. for the highest placed South African team.

Steeped in history and tradition, the Currie Cup dates back to 1891. The tournament is regarded as the cornerstone of South Africa&#x27;s rugby heritage, and the coveted gold trophy remains the most prestigious prize in South African domestic rugby.

==History==
The Currie Cup is one of the oldest rugby competitions, with the first games played in 1889 but it was only in 1892 that it became officially known as the Currie Cup. The competition had its humble beginnings as an inter-province competition in 1884, but when the South African Rugby Board was founded in 1889 it decided to organize a national competition that would involve representative teams from all the major unions. The original participating unions were Western Province, Griqualand West, Transvaal and Eastern Province. The first tournament was held in Kimberley and was won by Western Province. For a prize they received a silver cup donated by the South African Rugby Board, now displayed at the SA Rugby Museum in Cape Town. The story of how the Currie Cup came to be comes from the first overseas rugby team to tour South Africa in 1891, The British Isles, who carried with them a particularly precious bit of cargo. Among the bags, boots and balls was a golden cup given to them by Sir Donald Currie, owner of Union-Castle Lines, the shipping company that transported them to the southern tip of Africa. Sir Donald was clear with his instructions – hand this trophy over to the team in South Africa that gives the best game; and after a spirited display where the unbeaten British Lions narrowly won 3–0, Griqualand West became the first ever holders of the Currie Cup. They then handed the trophy over to the South African rugby board and it became the floating trophy for the Currie Cup competition. The inaugural Currie Cup tournament was thus held in 1892 with Western Province earning the honour of holding it aloft as the first official winners.

Western Province dominated the competition&#x27;s early years, and by 1920 the team from Cape Town had already secured the trophy 10 times. Only Griqualand West could halt the rampant WP side and win the trophy in 1899 and 1911. In 1922 the Transvaal won the competition for the first time, however Western Province would continue to dominate the Currie Cup throughout the 1920s and 1930s, winning the trophy a further 4 times and sharing it twice with Border. In 1939 the trophy returned to Johannesburg for only the second time after Transvaal defeated Western Province in Cape Town. This was the first time WP had lost a final at their home ground Newlands. The Currie Cup went into hiatus during the Second World War but resumed in 1946 when claimed their first ever trophy by beating Western Province 11–9 in the final at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria.
The late 1940s and early 1950s were dominated by Transvaal who would win the trophy in 1950 and 1952, however in 1954 the Currie Cup would finally return south following Western Province&#x27;s narrow 11–8 victory over in the final at Newlands in Cape Town. The competition missed a few years here for reasons such as war and the like, but in 1968 it became a fully fledged annual showpiece.

At the end of the apartheid 1980s, South African rugby supporters were treated to two of the most memorable Currie Cup finals. In 1989 winger Carel du Plessis scored a last-minute try as WP managed to draw with 16-all, Riaan Gouws missed the conversion which would have given WP its 6th title of the decade a feat which has never been achieved. The following year the Blue Bulls slipped up, though, and Natal sneaked home 18–12, inspired by fly-half Joel Stransky. The 1990s saw further improvement by Natal and the rise of Francois Pienaar&#x27;s Transvaal. Since the end of apartheid in 1990–4, and the age of professionalism in rugby union in the early 1990s, the Currie Cup has become much more competitive with no team able to carve out an era of dominance like that of WP in the early years or in the 1970s and 1980s. 
Whilst these days the competition lags behind the United Rugby Championship and The Rugby Championship (previously the Tri-Nations) in the order of importance, the Currie Cup still holds a special place amongst South African rugby supporters and players, with the trophy very much still the holy grail of South African domestic rugby.

In order to adjust to the European competition calendar, from the 2024 season the Currie Cup will take place in a new window. It is to be played between July and late September.

==Teams==
The following 14 provincial unions participate in the Currie Cup:

==Champions and Finals==

Between 1892 and 1920, the competition was held as a centralised tournament, with the team with the best record crowned as the winner. Between 1922 and 1936 (as well as in three tournaments between 1957 and 1966), the winner was the team with the best record following a round-robin competition. In all the other seasons, a final was played to determine the champion.

<doc id="350556" wikidata="Q5678346" url="?curid=350556" title="Hasan Čengić">
<text>Hasan Čengić (; 30 August 1957 – 7 November 2021) was a Bosniak politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Defence Minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the Bosnian War, Čengić was the main fundraiser and weapons buyer for Alija Izetbegović&#x27;s administration.

Regarded as a Muslim hardliner and one of the most influential people in Sarajevo, Čengić was a proponent of Iran&#x27;s influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

== Early life ==

Čengić was born in Odžak, Foča, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia, present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina to father Halid and mother Merjema nee Lutvikadić. He was a distant cousin of the Bosnian Muslim politician Adil Zulfikarpašić.

As a young imam, Čengić led a group called &quot;Tabački Masjid&quot;, which condemned discotheques and mixed marriages and advocated veiling of women as well as the prohibition of alcohol. For Loftus, Čengić was a sympathiser of the Iranian revolution who &quot;perceived a great deal of potential in a new internationalism&quot; and who advocated a pan-Islamic course for his community.

In 1981, Čengić published an article in the magazine &quot;Glasnik&quot; about the practice of Sharia law. In the article, Čengić investigated the application of Sharia in the Islamic world and wrote about Iran that it shows &quot;a growing tendency to break with Western models and a determination to return to their own laws, culture and civilisation&quot;. In the article, along with Jaafar Nimeiry of Sudan and Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan, he relied heavily on Ruhollah Khomeini, quoting him extensively. Loftus writes that in the article, Čengić sees the Iranian revolution as &quot;the most representative moment of the strength of the new Muslim coalition alongside 1973 oil embargo&quot;. In the article, Čengić holds the view that &quot;Muslims have the space, population, dynamism, strength, energy and money,&quot; concluding that there is no reason why they cannot become &quot;the master of tomorrow&#x27;s world&quot;. Loftus further writes that, although Čengić doesn&#x27;t mention Yugoslav Muslims in the article, he &quot;implicitly made space for his own community&quot; in &quot;a potential coalition of Islamic &quot;masters of tomorrow&quot;.

=== Sarajevo process ===

Čengić was a member of the Young Muslims, an Islamist organisation that was led by Alija Izetbegović. The members of the organisation, including both Izetbegović and Čengić, were trialed in 1983. Hamdija Pozderac, the president of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina, said the organisation was working towards pan-Islamism which would lead to &quot;ethnically cleansed Bosnia and Herzegovina&quot; and that they were looking for cooperation with the Muslim world, Iran especially. The prosecutors argued that the accused identified themselves with the Islamic revolution and that some of them secretly went to Teheran to mark the anniversary of the revolution, while the writings of the accused were used to underline these connections, and especially the Islamic Declaration authored by Izetbegović. At the end of the trial, each accused was sentenced to 14 years in prison for various Muslim nationalist activities.

== Bosnian War ==

During the Bosnian War, Alija Izetbegović appointed Čengić a chief fundraiser and weapons buyer, tasked with negotiating clandestine arms deals. Čengić traveled to foreign countries to negotiate the supply of weapons to Bosniak forces, including Iran. For his frequent travels to the Islamic countries he was nicknamed &quot;the flying imam&quot;. He was also a member of the advisory board of the Third World Relief Agency (TWRA) which is assumed to have brought $350 million to the government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war period from 1992 to 1995, at least half of which was used for arms smuggling. Most of the money came from the countries of the Middle East, including Iran, and especially Saudi Arabia. Donations also came from Turkey, Sudan, Brunei, Malaysia and Pakistan.

In the second half of 1991, the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) was very active in preparations for war, which the party leadership knew was inevitable. In June 1991, before Slovenia and Croatia declared independence and ten months before conflicts broke out in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the SDA decided to form its own paramilitary, the Patriotic League with Čengić, then a 43-year-old imam, as its head. Since the Patriotic League was in need of weapons, ammunition, supplies and uniforms, Čengić visited the Islamic countries for support.

Čengić, together with his father, was responsible for the maintenance of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), supply, traffic control, transport, and medical and veterinary services. These positions allowed them great influence, which was strongly used. Čengić preferred buttoned uniforms without a collar, modeled after the uniforms of the Iranians, and had a reputation as a tough man.

The &quot;Slobodna Bosna&quot; newspaper argued that Čengić was the business partner of Russian arms dealer and former KGB officer Viktor Bout, otherwise known as &quot;the Merchant of Death&quot;. In May 2006, when 200,000 AK-47 assault rifles went missing in transit from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Iraq, one of Bout&#x27;s airlines was the carrier.

According to Austrian police, he was on the supervisory board of the Third World Relief Agency (TWRA), a Sudan-based, phony humanitarian organization.

== Post-war ==

=== Ministry of Defence ===

After the signing of the Washington Agreement in March 1994 and the creation of the joint Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Čengić served in the Ministry of Defence of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a deputy of Vladimir Šoljić, a Bosnian Croat appointed to the post of a minister of defence.

Čengić was known as a hardliner Muslim, with close ties to a more moderate Izetbegović. Čengić had close ties to Iran and the US Ambassador in Sarajevo James W. Pardew regarded him as an agent of Iran. During the war, the United States ignored Iran&#x27;s arms supply. However, in the post-war period, the removal of Iranian fighters and influential persons was a non-negotiable condition for the implementation of the Train and Equip Program (T&amp;E).

During the war, there were hundreds of mujahideen from all over the Muslim world on the side of the Bosniaks. Their military value was doubtful, and many of them fought as part of the 4th, 7th and 8th Muslim brigades, considered among the best Bosniak units. At the same time, around 1,500 Iranian Revolutionary Guard fighters and advisers supported the Bosniak side. Iran maintained a large embassy in Sarajevo and provided direct financial support to the government as well as a security assistance program that included arming and military training of Bosniak soldiers in Iran. This is why many media, critical of the T&amp;E, criticized it for the possibility of arming and training Islamic extremists. This was the reason for Pardew and his team to try to eliminate the Iranian influence from Bosnia and Herzegovina and save the credibility of T&amp;E.

On the other hand, Čengić stood firmly by Ian and harshly criticized the United States. T&amp;E progressed with occasional setbacks. Bosniaks who were sympathetic to Iran criticised T&amp;E and considered Iran&#x27;s support more reliable. The Croatian media reported that Čengić launched an anti-American campaign and complained that the weapons delivered through T&amp;E were outdated. The SDA-controlled Sarajevo newspaper &quot;Ljiljan&quot; published an interview with Iranian diplomat Seyyed Mohsen Rasidouleslami, who revealed that in case the T&amp;E fails, Iran is waiting to train and arm Bosniak forces.

In June 1996, trying to push through the Defense Law in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Pardew, seeing Čengić as a major obstacle to T&amp;E and as a representative of Iran, informed Izetbegović that keeping people like Čengić would lead to isolationism and the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He also asked Izetbegović that all Mujahideen-oriented Iranians leave the country. The media increased the political pressure covering Iranian influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Already on June 26, Pardew presented the information that Iranian and other foreign fighters had been expelled and that there were less than 70 of them left in Bosnia and Herzegovina who were married to locals. President Clinton did not oppose their stay and informed Congress that the Iranians, except for the embassy staff, had left Bosnia and Herzegovina.

However, removing Čengić was significantly more difficult. The situation escalated by October 1996 when the United States was supposed to deliver over 40 tons of weapons to Bosnia and Herzegovina via the Croatian port of Ploče. Pardew insisted that the Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William J. Perry sign a letter demanding the removal of Čengić and that the same be delivered to Izetbegović. Pardrew handed this signed letter to Izetbegović on 22 September as an ultimatum. The insistence on Čengić&#x27;s removal caused great political difficulties in which high-ranking officials of the American, Bosnian-Herzegovinian and Croatian governments were involved. While Izetbegović was considering the ultimatum, the T&amp;E was stopped, and the ship that delivered a large amount of weapons stood still in the Adriatic Sea in front of the port of Ploče from 24 October onwards. Pardrew believed that stopping the supply of weapons was necessary in order for the Americans to maintain leverage over Izetbegović. He also influenced the American officials meeting with Izetbegović to persuade him to cut ties with Čengić.

Izetbegović hesitated to cut ties with Čengić. He tried to convince him to resign as Minister of Defence in order to appoint him to a more influential post. However, Čengić, using his strong influence, resisted the removal and publicly accused the United States of interfering in the appointment and removal of officials of another state. Izetbegović eventually agreed to fire Čengić on the condition that Bosnian Croat Minister Šoljić also leave office. Thus, Izetbegović aimed to portray as if both men failed, instead of singling out the Bosniak minister. Pardew accepted Izetbegović&#x27;s proposal and passed it on to Krešimir Zubak, the Croatian member of the BiH Presidency. The Croatian side accepted this offer, and Čengić was dismissed from the post on 4 November 1996. He was replaced by Sakib Mahmuljin.

=== Ministry of Displaced Persons and Refugees ===

After being dismissed from the Ministry of Defence, Čengić was appointed Minister of Displaced Persons and Refugees. In this position, Čengić took care of Bosniak refugees and performed his duties keeping in mind their deployment in case of the outbreak of a new war. However, in August 1997, ten T-55 tanks from Egypt were to arrive in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which Čengić bought at the end of the war. This delivery took place without the knowledge of the T&amp;E task force and indicated that Čengić was cooperating with Bosniak officials in the Ministry of Defence. The task force intervened and prevented the tanks from landing. The media expressed fear of the secret arms trade and Iranian influence. The task force used the situation to show that the United States was in control and to point out the danger that Čengić would represent for Bosniaks. Izetbegović&#x27;s administration, with the aim of mitigating the damage caused by Čengić, began closer cooperation with T&amp;E, and Čengić did not further disrupt the flow of T&amp;E.

He served as a member of parliament from 1998 to 2002.

He served as president of the Parliament of the Islamic Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2015 until 2019, having lost re-election in 2018.

Bosniak political commentator Avdo Avdić wrote that Čengić was the leader of one of the four Bosniak political clans, extracting his influence solely from the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Avdić wrote that Čengić also controlled the Party of Democratic Activity (A-SDA), an SDA-splinter party once prominent in the Una-Sana Canton and the so-called &quot;Malaysia&quot; sub-clan, which itself controls the People and Justice (NiP) party as well as Al Jazeera Balkans. The &quot;Malaysia&quot; sub-clan, according to Advić, is led by Amer Bukvić, the CEO of BBI Bank.

Čengić died on 7 November 2021, at the age of 64.

<text>John Woolman (October 19, 1720 (O.S.)/October 30, 1720 (N.S.)– October 7, 1772) was an American merchant, tailor, journalist, Quaker preacher, and early abolitionist during the colonial era. Based in Mount Holly, New Jersey, near Philadelphia, he traveled through the American frontier to preach Quaker beliefs, and advocate against slavery and the slave trade, cruelty to animals, economic injustices and oppression, and conscription. Beginning in 1755 with the outbreak of the French and Indian War, he urged tax resistance to deny support to the colonial military. In 1772, Woolman traveled to England, where he urged Quakers to support abolition of slavery.

Woolman published numerous essays, especially against slavery. He kept a journal throughout his life; it was published posthumously, entitled &quot;The Journal of John Woolman&quot; (1774). Included in Volume I of the Harvard Classics since 1909, it is considered a prominent American spiritual work. It has also been admired for the power and clarity of its prose by non-Quakers such as the philosopher John Stuart Mill, the poet William Ellery Channing, and the essayist Charles Lamb, who urged a friend to &quot;get the writings of John Woolman by heart.&quot; The &quot;Journal&quot; has been continuously in print since 1774, published in numerous editions; the most recent scholarly edition was published in 1989.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===

John Woolman was born in 1720, originally from Rancocas, New Jersey, into a family who were members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). His father, Samuel Woolman, was a farmer. The 150-acre Woolman farm sat on the north bank of the north branch of Rancocas Creek close to the western border of Rancocas State Park. Woolman&#x27;s maternal and paternal grandparents were early Quaker settlers in Burlington County, New Jersey.

During his youth, he happened upon a robin&#x27;s nest that held hatchlings. Woolman began throwing rocks at the mother robin to see if he could hit her. After killing the mother bird, he was filled with remorse, thinking of the baby birds who had no chance of survival without her. He got the nest down from the tree and quickly killed the hatchlings, believing it to be the most merciful thing to do. This experience weighed on his heart. He was inspired to love and protect all living things from then on.

Woolman married Sarah Ellis, a fellow Quaker, in a ceremony at the Chesterfield Friends Meeting, and they had a daughter whom they named Mary. His choice to lead a &quot;life of simplicity&quot; meant making sacrifices for his family.

===Career===
As a young man, Woolman began work as a clerk for a merchant. When he was 23, his employer asked him to write a bill of sale for an enslaved person. Though he told his employer that he thought that slaveholding was inconsistent with Christianity, he wrote the bill of sale.

By the age of 26, he had become an independent and successful tradesman. He refused to write the part of another customer&#x27;s will which would have bequeathed or transferred the ownership of a slave, and instead convinced the owner to set the enslaved person free by manumission. Many Friends (fellow Quakers) believed that slavery was a sin. Other Friends kept slaves but considered trading in slaves to be sinful.

Woolman eventually retired from business (i.e., &quot;merchandising&quot;) because he viewed profit-making as distracting from his religion. He wrote that he took up the trade of tailor in order to have more free time to travel and witness to fellow Quakers about his concerns.

===Testimony of Simplicity===
Woolman was committed to the Friends&#x27; Testimony of Simplicity. While in his 20s, he decided that the retail trade demanded too much of his time. He believed he had a calling to preach &quot;truth and light&quot; among Friends and others. In his &quot;Journal&quot;, he said that he quit the shop as it was &quot;attended with much outward care and cumber,&quot; that his &quot;mind was weaned from the desire of outward greatness,&quot; and that &quot;where the heart is set on greatness, success in business did not satisfy the craving.&quot; Woolman gave up his career as a tradesman and supported himself as a tailor; he also maintained a productive orchard.

He addressed issues of economic injustice and oppression in his &quot;Journal&quot; and other writings, and knew international trade had local effects. Despite supporting himself as a tailor, Woolman refused to use or wear dyed fabrics, because he had learned that many workers in the dye industry were poisoned by some of the noxious substances used. He is quoted as saying, &quot;May we look upon our treasures, the furniture of our houses, and our garments, and try whether the seeds of war have nourishment in these our possessions.&quot;
Woolman decided to minister to Friends and others in remote areas on the frontier. In 1746, he went on his first ministry trip with Isaac Andrews. They traveled about 1500 miles round-trip in three months, going as far south as North Carolina. He preached on many topics, including slavery, during this and other such trips.

===Anti-slavery activities===
In 1754 Woolman published &quot;&quot;. He continued to refuse to draw up wills that bequeathed ownership of slaves to heirs. Over time, and working on a personal level, he individually convinced many Quaker slaveholders to free their slaves. As Woolman traveled, when he accepted hospitality from a slaveholder, he insisted on paying the slaves for their work in attending him. He refused to be served with silver cups, plates, and utensils, as he believed that slaves in other regions were forced to dig such precious minerals and gems for the rich. He observed that some owners used the labor of their slaves to enjoy lives of ease, which he found to be the worst situation not only for the slaves but for the moral and spiritual condition of the owners. He could condone those owners who treated their slaves gently or worked alongside them.

Woolman worked within the Friends&#x27; tradition of seeking the guidance of the Spirit of Christ and patiently waiting to achieve unity in the Spirit. As he went from one Friends’ meeting to another, he expressed his concern about slaveholding. Gradually various Quaker Meetings began to see the evils of slavery; their minutes increasingly reflecting their condemnation of the practice. Quaker records bear witness to his and a few others&#x27; success – by the time the 1776–1783 revolution was over, almost all North American Quakers had freed their slaves, and those few Quakers who had been engaged in the trading or shipment of slaves had ceased such activities as well.

===Testimony of Peace ===

He lived out the Friends&#x27; Peace Testimony by protesting the French and Indian War (1754–1763), the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1755, he decided to oppose paying those colonial taxes that supported the war and urged tax resistance among fellow Quakers in the Philadelphia Meeting, even at a time when American settlers on the frontier were being raided by French and allied Native Americans. Some Quakers joined him in his protest, and the Meeting sent a letter on this issue to other groups. In one of his prophetic dreams, recorded in his &quot;Journal&quot;, Woolman negotiated between two heads of state in an effort to prevent an outbreak of war.

===Animal welfare===

Woolman was an advocate of animal welfare. He was not vegetarian, as he did eat meat. He opposed the overworking of draft animals and avoided stage-coaches as he believed the horses were abused. Woolman commented that &quot;true religion consisted in an inward life, wherein the heart doth love and reverence God the Creator, and learns to exercise true justice and goodness not only toward all men, but also toward the brute creatures.&quot;

=== Final days ===
Woolman&#x27;s final journey was to England in 1772. During the voyage he stayed in steerage and spent time with the crew, rather than in the better accommodations enjoyed by some passengers. He attended the British London Yearly Meeting. The Friends resolved to include an abolitionist statement in their Epistle (a type of letter sent to Quakers in other places). Woolman traveled to York, but he had contracted smallpox and died there. He was buried in York on October 9, 1772. 

There is strong doubt whether the portrait shown here (and very often elsewhere) can be of John Woolman. There is no known depiction of John Woolman but the authentic silhouette of his brother Uriah shows a very different face to this elderly, wizened subject.

==Legacy and honors==
In his lifetime, Woolman did not succeed in eradicating slavery even within the Society of Friends in colonial America. However, his personal efforts helped change Quaker viewpoints during the period of the Great Awakening. In 1790, after the American Revolutionary War, the Pennsylvania Society of Friends petitioned the United States Congress for the abolition of slavery. While unsuccessful at the national level, Quakers contributed to Pennsylvania&#x27;s abolition of slavery. In addition, in the first two decades after the war, they were active together with Methodist and Baptist preachers in the Upper South in persuading many slaveholders to manumit their slaves. The percentage of free people of color rose markedly during those decades, for instance, from less than one to nearly ten percent in Virginia. 
*The &quot;fair treatment of people of all races&quot; is today an integral part of the Friends&#x27; Testimony of Equality. 

*The &quot;Journal of John Woolman&quot; has been included since the first year of publication in 1909 in Volume I of &quot;The Harvard Classics,&quot; together with Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;His Autobiography&quot; and William Penn&#x27;s &quot;Fruits of Solitude.&quot; This was published by P.F. Collier and Sons of New York. Woolman&#x27;s Journal is considered a prominent American spiritual work and is the longest-published book in the history of North America other than the Bible, having been continuously in print since 1774.
*The John Woolman Memorial Association was formed in Mount Holly to promote his teachings. It sponsors an annual lecture and has published a volume of Woolman genealogy, with additional volumes planned.
*The John Woolman Memorial in Mount Holly, New Jersey is located near one of his former orchards. A brick house built between 1771 and 1783, reportedly for one of Woolman&#x27;s daughters and her husband, it is operated as a house museum and memorial. The Memorial&#x27;s parent organization also compiles an ongoing genealogical study of Woolman&#x27;s descendants; notable among them are actor Christopher Reeve and Collett Everman Woolman, a pioneer and innovator of air mail and aerial crop-dusting, and founder of Delta Airlines.
*1963, the John Woolman School was founded in his honor in Nevada City, California as a college-preparatory boarding school, serving students in grades 10–12. 
* The Woolman Institute was established at Wilmington College during the 1980s. 
*2003, a group of scholars of peace and justice studies founded the John Woolman College of Active Peace, which seeks to &#x27;mainstream&#x27; many Quaker (and other) concepts of peace and peacemaking into higher education.

* The John Woolman room at Friends House, London, UK is named after him.

<text>The Canadian Encyclopedia (TCE; ) is the national encyclopedia of Canada, published online by the Toronto-based historical organization Historica Canada, with financial support by the federal Department of Canadian Heritage and Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada. Compiled by more than 5,000 scholars and specialists, the publication is a non-partisan, non-political initiative by a not-for-profit organization without political or governmental ties.

First published in 1985, the consistently updated version has been available for free online in both English and French since 2001. The physical copy and website includes &quot;articles on Canadian biographies and places, history, the Arts, as well as First Nations, science and Canadian innovation.&quot; , over 700,000 volumes of the print version of &quot;TCE&quot; have been sold and over 6 million people visit &quot;TCE&quot;&#x27;s website yearly.

The encyclopedia website consists of more than 25,000 entries and over 60,000 multimedia items including images, maps, charts, games, assessments, and videos. The website incorporates, &quot;The Youth Encyclopedia of Canada&quot;, &quot;The Encyclopedia of Music in Canada&quot;, specialized articles on diverse subjects, articles from MacLean&#x27;s Magazine, and The Timeline of Canadian History. The website likewise provides an educational hub for educators and guardians, which includes instructional materials, assessments, and specialized study aids.

== History ==

=== Background ===
While attempts had been made to compile encyclopedic material on aspects of Canada, &quot;Canada: An Encyclopaedia of the Country&quot; (1898–1900), edited by J. Castell Hopkins, was the first attempt to produce an encyclopedic work entirely on the subject of Canada. This was followed by W. Stewart Wallace&#x27;s &quot;The Encyclopedia of Canada&quot; (Macmillan, 1935–37), which was then sold to an American publisher, the Grolier Society, providing the core of John Everett Robbins&#x27; &quot;Encyclopedia Canadiana&quot; (1957).

More common, however, were encyclopedic works focused on particular qualities of Canada. For instance, in 1911, Arthur Doughty and L.J. Burpee compiled the &quot;Index and Dictionary of Canadian History&quot; as a companion to the &quot;Makers of Canada&quot; series; Doughty and Adam Shortt edited the 23-volume &quot;Canada and Its Provinces&quot; (1913–17); Norah Story&#x27;s &quot;The Oxford Companion to Canadian History and Literature&quot; was published in 1967; the comprehensive &quot;Encyclopedia of Music in Canada&quot; was published in 1981 and revised in 1992; and a new &quot;Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature&quot;, edited by William Toye, was published in 1983.

=== Creating &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; ===
By the 1970s, Canada had been without a national encyclopedia since Robbins&#x27; 1957 work, which by that time was terribly outdated.

With this in mind, Edmonton-based Canadian nationalist and publisher Mel Hurtig was left unimpressed with the lack of Canadian reference works as well as with the various omissions and blatant errors (e.g., Brian Mulroney was described as a Liberal rather than Conservative) found in existing encyclopedias with Canadian entries. In response, Hurtig launched a project in the 1970s to create a wholly new Canadian encyclopedia.

In 1978, around the province of Alberta&#x27;s 75th anniversary, Hurtig approached the Alberta government with the idea of supporting Hurtig&#x27;s idea of an encyclopedia as Alberta&#x27;s &quot;gift to Canada&quot;, which gained the support of Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed. On 15 November 1979, the Alberta Legislature announced that the provincial government would underwrite the development costs of the encyclopedia with CA$3.4 million and would donate a further $600,000 towards the delivery of a free copy to every school and library in Canada. (This was done on the condition that no other funding would be able to obscure the gesture of the Alberta Government.)

Taking on this publishing &#x27;megaproject&#x27;, Hurtig would spend the next few years raising funds from banks for printing and marketing. The concern of a French-language edition was put aside with a guarantee by Hurtig that the rights would be donated free to a publisher in Quebec.

Hurtig held a nationwide search for an editor-in-chief, including with an advertisement in the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;. Soon after, James Harley Marsh was hired as editor-in-chief in 1980. Marsh recruited more than 3,000 authors to write for the encyclopedia. They made index cards for every fact in the encyclopedia, signed off by the researcher, utilized three sources, and had every article read by three outside readers. Then, the entire encyclopedia was proofread by an independent source. Over 3,000 people contributed to the content and accuracy of the encyclopedia&#x27;s entries.

=== First editions ===
By May 1984, Hurtig Publishers had received over 105,000 in pre-sale orders for the first edition of &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, which was finally published in 1985 (). Carrying nearly 3 million words within three separate volumes, it featured over 2,500 contributors and included more than 9,000 articles. Costing $125 per set, this first edition sold out within days of publication and became a Canadian bestseller; nearly 150,000 sets sold in six months.

Two years later, Alain Stanké of Montreal published the first French edition of the encyclopedia, &quot;Encyclopédie canadienne&quot;, in three volumes.

A revised and expanded edition of &quot;TCE&quot; was released in 1988 (), selling out just as the first. This edition would add a fourth volume and around 500,000 new words. Encoded in a markup language precursor of HTML, this edition would be the first encyclopedia in the world to use a computer to help compile, typeset, design, and print it. These additions received positive reviews and praise for their creation.

=== 1990s ===
In September 1990, Hurtig published The&quot; &quot;Junior Encyclopedia of Canada (), illustrated with over 3000 photos, drawings, and maps. This five-volume encyclopedia was funded by the federal Department of Communications and a grant from the CRB Foundation of Montreal. It would be the first encyclopedia for young Canadians.

In May 1991, Hurtig sold his publishing company to McClelland &amp; Stewart (M&amp;S), and the encyclopedia along with it. Soon, a vice president at M&amp;S would be the first to usher in the first real electronic version of the encyclopedia in 1995: The Canadian Encyclopedia Plus, published as a digital CD-ROM (), with searching capability, hot links to related articles, and multimedia. This digital format would also eventually incorporate the &quot;Gage Canadian Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot; with the text of &quot;TCE&quot;, as well as incorporating the &quot;Columbia Encyclopedia&quot;.

The first edition of the encyclopedia on CD-ROM was released in 1993; the second, in 1995.

The 1998–99 &quot;Canadian Encyclopedia on CD-ROM&quot; came in three separate versions:
# an updated World Edition with a new interactive quiz called &quot;Canucklehead&quot;
# a new Student Edition with the updated and revised text of the &quot;Junior Encyclopedia of Canada&quot;
# a Deluxe version, which included all the material on “World” and 5 additional disks

&quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; was able to become fully bilingual through a grant from Heritage Canada, which helped to complete the project of translating the over-4-million pieces of text into French. By 2000, the electronic encyclopedia included a fourth version: &quot;National&quot;.

In 1999, McClelland &amp; Stewart published the year-2000 edition, incorporating all four previous volumes in a single book (), followed by Stanké&#x27;s French edition the next year. Also in 1999, Avie Bennett, the Chair of McClelland &amp; Stewart, transferred the ownership of the encyclopedia to the Historica Foundation. Later that year, the Historica Foundation made a full version of &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; available online.

=== Online ===
Launching in Edmonton in October 2001, the real online version of &quot;TCE&quot; was programmed by NetCentrics in Edmonton and its interface designed by 7th Floor Media in Vancouver. In 2002/2003, an online version of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Music in Canada&quot;, including around 3,000 articles and 500 illustrations, was incorporated into &quot;TCE&quot;.

On March 31, 2013, Marsh stepped down as editor-in-chief of &quot;TCE&quot; in retirement.

The enhanced interactive format that &quot;TCE&quot; currently uses online was first released in October 2013. Today, &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; is available entirely online. The &quot;TCE&quot;&#x27;s current editor-in-chief is Bronwyn Graves.

== Organization ==
As the President and CEO of Historica Canada since 2012, Anthony Wilson-Smith is also the publisher of the encyclopedia. As of 2021, the encyclopedia has over 5,000 scholars and specialists that contribute.

&quot;TCE&quot; is funded by SOCAN as well as the federal Department of Canadian Heritage. Its partners include the Canadian Children&#x27;s Book Centre, Musée des grands Québécois, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, and Maclean&#x27;s.

&quot;TCE&quot; claims to be &quot;non-partisan and apolitical&quot; and that they are &quot;not affiliated with any government or political party&quot;.

<text>Valentin Vitalyevich Lebedev (; born April 14, 1942, in Moscow) is a former Soviet cosmonaut who made two flights into space. His stay aboard the Space Station Salyut 7 with Anatoly Berezovoy in 1982, which lasted 211 days, was recorded in the Guinness Book of Records.

Since 1989 Lebedev has dedicated himself to scientific work. In 1991 he started the Scientific Geoinformation Center of the Russian Academy of Science. He continues as that Center&#x27;s Director through the present day.

Valentin Lebedev is a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Professor, and Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation.

==Education==
After graduation from high school, Valentin Lebedev studied for a year (1960) at the Higher Air Force Navigators School in Orenburg, but he was discharged as a result of an armed forces reduction. He continued his studies at the Moscow Aviation Institute, from which he graduated in 1966.

In 1975 Lebedev defended his Ph.D. thesis on “Methods of formation of the dynamic test bench for the base service of spaceship and crew training”. In 1985 he defended his doctoral thesis on “Methods of carrying of astrophysical explorations aboard of orbital stations”.

==Career==

===Cosmonaut career===
After his graduation from the Moscow Aviation Institute, Lebedev worked for 23 years at the Central Design Bureau &quot;Energy&quot; (SPU &quot;Energy&quot;) of the Soviet Scientific Production Union as an engineer, senior research fellow, and a methodology instructor in the cosmonaut&#x27;s detachment.

In 1967 Lebedev participated in an expedition of the Eighth Naval Squadron to locate, rescue, and rehabilitate the spaceship Zond after its landing in the Indian Ocean.

In 1968 Lebedev led the specialists in Bombay supporting Zond 5, which flew around the Moon and returned to Earth. He continued leading technical detachments in the flying, design, testing and control of the spaceship Soyuz and Soyuz T, and the orbiting space stations Salyut 4, Salyut 5, and Salyut 6.

Valentin Lebedev trained as a cosmonaut from 1971–1973, at the Yuri A. Gagarin Center for Cosmonaut Training. He earned a diploma in 1972, given the title Cosmonaut Investigator, and taken on to the cosmonaut&#x27;s team ZKBEM. His first space flight was with Peter Klimuk, as a crew engineer aboard Soyuz 13, which orbited Earth from 18–26 December 1973. After this space flight, Lebedev was awarded a gold medal, &quot;Hero of Soviet Union&quot;, the Order of Lenin, and promoted to the rank of Pilot Cosmonaut.

In 1982 Lebedev, along with Anatoly Berezovoy, spent 211 days in space (13 May – 10 December) as a crew engineer of the space station Salyut 7. During this mission Lebedev conducted more than 300 scientific experiments and studies. The 211-day flight was a record for that time, and recorded in the Guinness Book of Records. During that flight, an additional entry in to the Guinness Book of Records was filed under &quot;First species of plant to flower in space&quot;, when his Arabidopsis flowered in July. After that space flight, Lebedev was awarded a second gold medal, &quot;Hero of Soviet Union&quot;, and a second Order of Lenin.

In 2000 he became the first cosmonaut ever elected to the Russian Academy of Science.

Lebedev retired from the space program in 1993.

===Scientific career===

In the years following his second return from space, Lebedev became renowned as a specialist in the field of cosmonautics and geoinformation.

From 1989 until 1991, Valentin Lebedev worked as deputy director of science at the Institute of Geography AS USSR, completely dedicated to scientific work. At the same time he was acting director of the Geoinformation Center (GIC), which was part of this institute. In 1991 the Geoinformation Center became an independent organization: the Scientific Geoinformation Center of the Russian Academy of Science. Lebedev continued there as its director.

Under V. Lebedev&#x27;s scientific leadership a unified technology was developed for the creation of maps showing the dynamics of ecosystems. This technology enabled the creation of multilayer maps of natural environments, showing changes over time. These maps were instrumental in the creation of the Ecological Geoinformaion System of the Moscow Automobile Ring Road (Russian: GIS EcoMKAD), which monitored changes in land, surface water, ground water, and flora, due to pollution created by traffic on Moscow&#x27;s Ring Road.

Together with the Hydrometerological Center of Russia and IWP, as part of a federal program on Reviving the Volga River, the RAS created a new technology for predicting spring floods, based on analysis of runoff from snow blankets, the moisture content of soil (frozen during winter months), and the current state of the landscape.

One of the latest scientific projects of Lebedev and his staff, executed within a program called &quot;Science To Moscow&quot;, is a work to remotely monitor Moscow transport traffic flow. Using original methods plus high-resolution aerial image digital processing software, the team obtained reliable data about city transport traffic volume, speed and ecological parameters of transport flow. This data became the basis for modifying street traffic and development of an automated traffic management system called &quot;Start&quot;.

The GIS EcoMKAD developed green space for Central and Northeastern Moscow districts. It required developments to establish normalized information environment of megapolis and regions. It created the concept of unified geoinformation space for all of Russia.

===Other Positions===
CPSU member, 1971–present

Komsomol Central Committee member, 1974–1978

President of USSR Acrobatics Federation, 1975–1991

Member of the national Olympics committee, 1976–1991

Member, RAS President&#x27;s workgroup on risk assessment and security issues

Member, Editorial Council, &quot;Herald of Computer and Information Technologies&quot; magazine

==Publications==
Valentin Lebedev is the author of 157 scientific works; author and coauthor of nine monographs and two school textbooks for the Moscow Aviation Institute; 27 articles in “Science and Life” magazine; and a large number of publications in domestic and foreign press. Lebedev was also awarded 26 authors certificates for inventions introduced in the Soyuz and Salyut missions.

Lebedev is the author of “Diary of a Cosmonaut: 211 Days in Space”, written entirely while he was serving aboard the &quot;space complex&quot; &quot;TS &quot;Soyuz-5&quot; - &quot;Salyut-7&quot; - Soyuz T-7&quot;. The book was published in both the United States (1988, 1990) and Russia, under the title “Angle of My Judgment”(1994). Extracts from the book were also published in many scientific magazines in Russia and internationally.

<doc id="350565" wikidata="Q1078239" url="?curid=350565" title="IWI Negev">
<text>The IWI Negev (also known as the Negev NG-5) is a 5.56×45mm NATO light machine gun developed by Israel Weapon Industries (IWI), formerly Israel Military Industries Ltd. (IMI).

In 2012, IWI introduced the Negev NG-7, a variant chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO. The NG stands for Next Generation. Both variants of the Negev are in service with the Israel Defense Forces.

== Development ==
The Negev started development in 1985 by Israel Military Industries (now Israel Weapon Industries) to replace the then in service Galil ARM. The Negev entered service with the IDF in 1997, after extensive testing conducted by the IDF Ordnance Corps. The Negev is named after the Negev Desert in southern Israel.

==Design details==

The Negev is a gas-operated, air-cooled, open bolt, select-fire, light machine gun (LMG) with a rotating bolt. The Negev uses a long-stroke gas piston system that runs under the barrel and is connected directly to the bolt carrier, the gas system comes with a three position gas regulator for use with different feed types and conditions. The design was made to be reliable, especially in adverse conditions. It was officially adopted by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in 1997.

=== Barrel ===
The Negev has a quick-change chrome-lined cold hammer forged barrel. The barrel is fitted with a slotted flash suppressor and a folding ambidextrous carry handle, which is used to carry the weapon and remove the barrel of the Negev.

During the weapon&#x27;s initial development a barrel with a (1:12 in) rifling twist rate was also planned, adapted for the lightweight M193 cartridge. Additionally, a multifunction muzzle device was designed, used to launch rifle grenades.

=== Sights and hardware ===
==== Sights ====
The Negev&#x27;s iron sights (closed-type) consist of a front post (adjustable for both windage and elevation) and a rear aperture sight with an elevation adjustment drum, with 300 to 1,000 m range settings in 100 m increments. The sight line radius is . The Negev is equipped with tritium sights for night-time operations, the vials are embedded into the front and rear sights, with a night sight exposed on the rear aperture.

The Negev has its sight rail mounted to the frame of the gun, and not the feed top cover, which is detached when reloading. This allows it to stay zeroed for a longer period of time when mounting red-dot, reflex sights or other optics.

The classic Negev did not possess the modern standardized Picatinny rail, and instead came with a welded adapter for an optical sight. The newer NG-5 and NG-7 have a standard picatinny rail, and in Israel are usually fitted with an optical scope similar to the standard scopes of Israeli assault rifles.

==== Stock ====
The full size Negev and Negev SF was originally manufactured with a metal-tube, fixed-length, folding (right) stock. This classic tube skeleton stock was a modified stock from the Galil rifle. The design of the Negev&#x27;s recoil springs and non-reciprocating handle, allow the Negev to fire with the skeleton stock folded; however during reload the bolt cannot be actuated with the stock folded.

The Negev NG-5 came fitted with an adjustable length folding stock, that folds to the opposite direction to allow complete operation of the gun with the stock folded, with cheek well adjustment, allowing for easier fitting.

==== Bipod ====
Every variant of the Negev can have a folding bipod, installed to the forward end of the handguard and folded under and becoming part of the handguard when stowed. The receiver also has slots and hooks used to secure the weapon to vehicle mounting hardware, including helicopters.

The Negev SF &#x27;Commando&#x27; variants also come with a 45 degree forward grip &quot;assault handle&quot;, allowing controlled fire while not using the bipod. The assault grip and bipod can be installed together, however the bipod cannot be folded with the assault grip installed.

The classic Negev could be fitted with mounting hardware on the handguard to allow users to mount a laser pointer. Current Negev models come mounting positions for bipods and the &quot;assault grip&quot; as well as a number of picatinny rails, including on the handguard allowing users to mount other hardware, including: laser pointers or laser target and illumination devices.

=== Ammunition ===

The standard Negev is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO, optimized for the SS109 cartridge. The Negev NG-7 and 7 ULMG variants are chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO.

The Negev feeds from an M27 disintegrating, open-link ammunition belt, carried in a 150-round fabric container that clips into the magazine well, or alternatively from a 35-round box magazine from the Galil assault rifle, or a 30-round STANAG magazine from the M16 rifle (with the use of an adapter). 200-round ammunition belt containers are also available. Belted ammunition is introduced into the feed tray port from the left side, while the magazine is inserted vertically into the magazine well at the base of the receiver.

The feed system, which loosely copies the Czechoslovakian Vz. 52 and the PK, uses a lever mounted on the left wall of the receiver and driven by a cam in the recoiling bolt carrier to turn a small feed pawl. The belt is pushed by the pawl only during the rearward movement of the bolt carrier.

The Negev 7 ULMG and ULMG SF, can be converted to 6.5mm Creedmoor cartridge by changing barrels; and feed from standard M13 disintegrating links.

In late 2024, Vietnam revealed a local Negev variant, designated as the STrL-7,62VN (), being the first product utilizing the Negev platform but chambered in 7.62×39mm. Likely becoming the country&#x27;s next standard-issued light machine gun succeeding the obsoleted RPD machine guns, STrL-7,62VN is compatible to both AK/STV/RPK&#x27;s magazines and RPD&#x27;s 100-round non-disintegrating belt, using a soft belt box instead of RPD&#x27;s heavy metal drum container.

== Variants ==

<doc id="350567" wikidata="Q355522" url="?curid=350567" title="Mitch McConnell">
<text>Addison Mitchell McConnell III (; born February 20, 1942) is an American politician and retired attorney serving as the senior United States senator from Kentucky, a seat he has held since 1985. McConnell is in his seventh Senate term and is the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history. He served from 2007 to 2025 as the leader of the Senate Republican Conference, including two stints as minority leader (2007 to 2015 and 2021 to 2025), and was majority leader from 2015 to 2021, making him the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history.

McConnell holds conservative political positions, although he was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican early in his political career. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;, which partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives during the Obama administration, making frequent use of the filibuster, and blocked many of President Obama&#x27;s judicial nominees, including Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.

During the first Trump administration, the Senate Republican majority under McConnell&#x27;s leadership passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018, the First Step Act, and the Great American Outdoors Act, and confirmed a record number of federal appeals court judges during a president&#x27;s first two years. McConnell invoked the nuclear option to eliminate the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, after his predecessor Harry Reid had eliminated the filibuster for all other presidential nominations; Trump subsequently won Supreme Court confirmation battles over Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. While supportive of most of Trump&#x27;s domestic and foreign policies, McConnell criticized Trump&#x27;s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and despite voting to acquit in Trump&#x27;s second impeachment trial for reasons related to the constitutionality of impeaching a former president, deemed him &quot;practically and morally responsible&quot; for the January 6 United States Capitol attack. In late 2024, McConnell wrote an essay on his current view of American power and the foreign policy mistakes of former presidents.

In 2015, 2019 and 2023, &quot;Time&quot; listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. On February 28, 2024, McConnell announced that he would step down as the Senate Republican Conference Leader in January 2025, but would serve the remainder of his Senate term. An internal election to fill the post of Senate Republican Leader was held on November 13, in which South Dakota senator John Thune was selected.

On February 20, 2025 (his 83rd birthday), McConnell announced he would not run for an eighth Senate term in 2026 and would retire from politics. This came after increasing concerns about his health and ability to continue serving.

==Early life and education (1942–1967)==
McConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene &quot;Dean&quot; ( Shockley) and Addison Mitchell &quot;A.M.&quot; McConnell II at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama, and grew up in Athens, Alabama, where his grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home. He is of Scots-Irish and English descent. His ancestor James McConnell fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.

In 1944, at the age of two, McConnell&#x27;s upper left leg was paralyzed by a polio attack. He and his mother were living with an aunt in Five Points, Alabama, at the time, and he received treatment at the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation. The treatment potentially saved him from being disabled for the rest of his life. McConnell said his family &quot;almost went broke&quot; because of costs related to his illness.

In 1950, when he was eight, McConnell moved with his family from Athens to Augusta, Georgia, where his father, who was in the Army, was stationed at Fort Gordon.

In 1956, his family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where he attended duPont Manual High School. McConnell was elected student council president at his high school during his junior year. He graduated Omicron Delta Kappa from the University of Louisville with a B.A. in political science in 1964 with honors. He was president of the Student Council of the College of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity.

McConnell attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. In 1964, at the age of 22, he attended civil rights rallies, and interned with Senator John Sherman Cooper. He has said his time with Cooper inspired him to run for the Senate later in life.

In 1967, McConnell graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Law, where he was president of the Student Bar Association.

==Early career (1967–1984)==
In March 1967, shortly before the expiration of his educational draft deferment upon graduation from law school, McConnell enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve as a private at Louisville. This was a coveted position because the Reserve units were mostly kept out of combat during the Vietnam War. His first day of training at Fort Knox, Kentucky, was July 9, 1967, two days after taking the bar exam, and his last day was August 15, 1967. Shortly after his arrival he was diagnosed with optic neuritis and deemed medically unfit for military service, and was honorably discharged. McConnell&#x27;s political opponents have repeatedly made an issue of his brief time in service during his electoral campaigns.

From 1968 to 1970, McConnell worked as chief legislative assistant to Senator Marlow Cook in Washington, D.C., managing a legislative department consisting of five members as well as assisting with speechwriting and constituent services.

In 1971, McConnell returned to Louisville, where he worked on Tom Emberton&#x27;s campaign for governor of Kentucky, which was unsuccessful. McConnell attempted to run for a seat in the state legislature but was disqualified because he did not meet the residency requirements for the office. He then worked for the Louisville law firm Segal, Isenberg, Sales and Stewart for a few years. During the same period, he taught a night class on political science at the University of Louisville.

In October 1974, McConnell returned to Washington to fill a position as Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Ford, where he worked alongside Robert Bork, Laurence Silberman, and Antonin Scalia. He also served as acting United States Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs under President Ford in 1975.

In 1977, McConnell was elected the Jefferson County judge/executive, the top political office in Jefferson County, Kentucky, at the time, defeating incumbent Democrat Todd Hollenbach III, 53% to 47%. He was reelected in 1981 against Jefferson County Commissioner Jim &quot;Pop&quot; Malone, 51% to 47%, outspending Malone 3–1, and occupied the office until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1984.

==U.S. Senate (1985–present)==

In his early years as a politician in Kentucky, McConnell was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican. Over time he became more conservative. According to one of his biographers, McConnell transformed &quot;from a moderate Republican who supported abortion rights and public employee unions to the embodiment of partisan obstructionism and conservative orthodoxy on Capitol Hill.&quot; McConnell has widely been described as an obstructionist.

From 1997 to 2001, McConnell chaired the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the body charged with securing electoral victories for Republicans. On February 12, 1999, he was one of 50 senators to vote to convict and remove Bill Clinton from office. He was first elected Majority Whip in the 108th Congress. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist did not seek reelection in the 2006 elections. In November, after Republicans lost control of the Senate, they elected McConnell minority leader. After Republicans took control of the Senate following the 2014 Senate elections, McConnell became the Senate Majority Leader. In June 2018 he became the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in U.S. history. McConnell is the second Kentuckian to serve as a party leader in the Senate (after Alben W. Barkley led the Democrats from 1937 to 1949) and the longest-serving U.S. senator from Kentucky.

McConnell has a reputation as a skilled political strategist and tactician. This reputation dimmed after Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in 2017 during consolidated Republican control of government.

McConnell regularly obtained earmarks for businesses and institutions in Kentucky until Congress banned the practice in 2010. He has been criticized for funding &quot;temporary patches&quot; to Kentucky&#x27;s long-term healthcare problems while simultaneously opposing and obstructing national programs that seek to improve healthcare more systematically, such as Obamacare and Medicaid expansion.

===Relationships with presidential administrations===

====Obama====
As the leading Republican senator, McConnell confronted and pressured other Republican senators who were willing to negotiate with Democrats and the Obama administration. According to Purdue University political scientist Bert A. Rockman, &quot;pure party line voting has been evident now for some time ... but rarely has the tactic of &#x27;oppositionism&#x27; been so boldly stated as McConnell did.&quot; According to University of Texas legal scholar Sanford Levinson, McConnell learned that obstruction and Republican unity were the optimal ways to ensure Republican gains in upcoming elections after he observed how Democratic cooperation with the Bush administration on No Child Left Behind and Medicare Part D helped Bush&#x27;s 2004 reelection. Levinson noted, &quot;McConnell altogether rationally ... concluded that Republicans have nothing to gain, as a political party, from collaborating in anything that the president could then claim as an achievement.&quot; A number of political scientists, historians, and legal scholars have characterized McConnell&#x27;s obstructionism and constitutional hardball as contributors to democratic erosion in the United States.

In October 2010, McConnell said, &quot;the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.&quot; Asked whether this meant &quot;endless, or at least frequent, confrontation with the president&quot;, McConnell said, &quot;if [Obama is] willing to meet us halfway on some of the biggest issues, it&#x27;s not inappropriate for us to do business with him.&quot; According to political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson, &quot;Facing off against Obama, [McConnell] worked to deny even minimal Republican support for major presidential initiatives—initiatives that were, as a rule, in keeping with the moderate model of decades past, and often with moderate Republican stances of a few years past.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote early in Obama&#x27;s administration that &quot;on the major issues—not just health care, but financial regulation and the economic stimulus package, among others—Mr. McConnell has held Republican defections to somewhere between minimal and nonexistent, allowing him to slow the Democratic agenda if not defeat aspects of it.&quot; The Republican caucus threatened repeatedly to force the United States to default on its debt, McConnell saying he had learned from the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis that &quot;it&#x27;s a hostage that&#x27;s worth ransoming&quot;.

McConnell worked to delay and obstruct health care reform and banking reform, two of the most notable pieces of legislation that Democrats navigated through Congress early in Obama&#x27;s tenure. Political scientists noted that &quot;by slowing action even on measures supported by many Republicans, McConnell capitalized on the scarcity of floor time, forcing Democratic leaders into difficult trade-offs concerning which measures were worth pursuing. ... Slowing the Senate&#x27;s ability to process even routine measures limited the sheer volume of liberal bills that could be adopted.&quot;

=====Use of the filibuster=====
One of McConnell&#x27;s most common tactics as minority leader to delay or obstruct legislation and judicial appointments was the filibuster. A filibuster is an attempt to &quot;talk a bill to death&quot;, forcing Senate leadership to abandon a proposed measure instead of waiting out the filibuster―or at least to delay the measure&#x27;s passage. In the Senate, any senator may speak for unlimited duration unless a 60-person majority votes to invoke cloture, or end debate, and proceed to a final vote. Political scientists have referred to McConnell&#x27;s use of the filibuster as &quot;constitutional hardball&quot;, referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy.

Political scientists Hacker and Pierson describe the rationale behind McConnell&#x27;s filibusters: &quot;Filibusters left no fingerprints. When voters heard that legislation had been &#x27;defeated&#x27;, journalists rarely highlighted that this defeat meant a minority had blocked a majority. Not only did this strategy produce an atmosphere of gridlock and dysfunction; it also chewed up the Senate calendar, restricting the range of issues on which Democrats could progress.&quot;

In 2013, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid eliminated the filibuster for all presidential nominations except the Supreme Court. By that time, nearly half of all votes to invoke cloture in the history of the Senate had occurred during Obama&#x27;s presidency. In April 2017, Senate Republicans led by McConnell eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations in order to end debate on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch. In August 2019, McConnell wrote an editorial for &quot;The New York Times&quot; strongly opposing the elimination of the filibuster on legislation.

==== Trump ====

McConnell initially endorsed fellow Kentucky senator Rand Paul for president in 2016. Paul withdrew from the race after the Iowa caucuses, and McConnell endorsed presumptive nominee Donald Trump on May 4, 2016. But McConnell disagreed with Trump on many occasions. In May 2016, after Trump suggested that federal judge Gonzalo P. Curiel was biased against Trump because of his Mexican heritage, McConnell said: &quot;I don&#x27;t agree with what [Trump] had to say. This is a man who was born in Indiana. All of us came here from somewhere else.&quot; In July 2016, after Trump criticized the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim-American soldier who was killed in Iraq, McConnell said, &quot;All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services.&quot; On October 7, 2016, following the Donald Trump &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; controversy, McConnell said, &quot;As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.&quot; In private, McConnell reportedly expresses disdain for Trump and &quot;abhors&quot; his behavior.

In October 2017, White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon and other Trump allies blamed McConnell for stalling the Trump administration&#x27;s legislation. In response, McConnell cited Neil Gorsuch&#x27;s confirmation to the Supreme Court to show that the Senate supported Trump&#x27;s agenda.

After Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, McConnell at first refused to recognize Biden as the winner. In his public statements, McConnell did not repeat any of Trump&#x27;s false claims of voter fraud, but did not contradict them, ignoring questions about evidence and instead arguing that Trump had the right to challenge the results. At the same time that McConnell refused to recognize Biden, he celebrated Republicans who won their Senate and House races in the same elections.

On December 15, the day after the electoral college vote, McConnell reversed his stance and publicly acknowledged Biden&#x27;s win, saying, &quot;Today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.&quot; On January 6, during the Electoral College vote count, McConnell spoke out against the efforts of Trump and his allies to overturn the election:

Later that day, he described the storming of the Capitol building (which occurred while the Electoral College votes were being counted) as a &quot;failed insurrection&quot; that &quot;tried to disrupt our democracy&quot;.

On April 10, 2021, Trump called McConnell a &quot;dumb son of a bitch&quot;. Trump added: &quot;I hired his wife. Did he ever say thank you?&quot; Trump has continued to attack McConnell in personal terms since then, but McConnell has not responded publicly.

=====First impeachment=====

On November 5, 2019, as the House of Representatives began public hearings on the impeachment of President Trump, McConnell said, &quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure how [an impeachment trial is] likely to end. ... If it were today, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any question. It would not lead to a removal.&quot;

On December 14, 2019, McConnell met with White House counsel Pat Cipollone and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland. Later that day, he said that for Trump&#x27;s impeachment trial, he would be in &quot;total coordination with the White House counsel&#x27;s office&quot; and Trump&#x27;s representatives. He also said there was &quot;no chance&quot; the Senate would convict Trump and remove him from office.

On December 17, 2019, McConnell rejected a request to call four witnesses for Trump&#x27;s impeachment trial because, according to McConnell, the Senate&#x27;s role was to &quot;act as judge and jury&quot;, not to investigate. Later that day, McConnell told the media: &quot;I&#x27;m not an impartial juror [in this impeachment trial]. This is a political process. There&#x27;s not anything judicial about it.&quot;

After Trump&#x27;s acquittal, McConnell was noted for his ability to block witnesses, to secure Trump&#x27;s acquittal, and to maintain party unity during the impeachment process. Commentators noted that he had kept Republican senators &quot;marching in lockstep&quot; throughout the process.

=====Second impeachment=====
On January 12, 2021, it was reported that McConnell supported impeaching Trump for his role in inciting the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, believing it would make it easier for Republicans to purge the party of Trump and rebuild the party. On January 13, despite having the authority to call for an emergency meeting of the Senate to hold the Senate trial, McConnell did not reconvene the chamber, claiming unanimous consent was required. He called for delaying the Senate trial until after Biden&#x27;s inauguration. Once the Senate trial started, McConnell voted to acquit Trump on February 13, 2021, saying it was unconstitutional to convict a president who was no longer in office.

The vote to convict was a bipartisan majority (57–43) but not enough to pass the two-thirds threshold. After the vote, McConnell lambasted and condemned Trump in a 20-minute speech on the Senate floor, saying he believed Trump was guilty of everything the House managers alleged. He said:

He explained why he nonetheless voted to acquit: &quot;Article II, Section 4 must have force. It tells us the President, Vice President, and civil officers may be impeached and convicted. Donald Trump is no longer the president. Clearly that mandatory sentence cannot be applied to somebody who has left office. The entire process revolves around removal. If removal becomes impossible, conviction becomes insensible.&quot; Yet he said that Trump &quot;didn&#x27;t get away with anything yet&quot; since Trump would remain subject to the country&#x27;s criminal and civil laws.

When there was a proposal for an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack, McConnell sought to organize Republican senators to filibuster it, and on May 28, 2021, he voted against its creation.

=====Second term=====
McConnell stepped down as Senate Republican leader in 2024, months before the 2024 United States elections. John Thune was elected to succeed him after Republicans regained the majority in the 2024 U.S. Senate elections. 

McConnell has been described as largely irrelevant in Trump&#x27;s second term. He has voted against three of Trump&#x27;s cabinet nominees: Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense, Tulsi Gabbard for the Director of National Intelligence, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services.

====Biden====
McConnell&#x27;s relationship with the Biden administration has been portrayed in media as one of comity. Biden has described McConnell as &quot;a friend, colleague and &#x27;man of his word.&#x27;&quot; McConnell has praised bipartisan legislation they worked on together, and was the only Republican to attend the 2015 funeral of Biden&#x27;s son Beau Biden.

In October 2021, McConnell helped pass a bill that extended the debt ceiling. He convinced 11 Republicans to vote with the Democrats for it, without which the United States would have defaulted on its debts.

===Judicial nominees===
====Under Obama====
Throughout Obama&#x27;s tenure, McConnell led Senate Republicans in what has been called &quot;a disciplined, sustained, at times underhanded campaign to deny the Democratic president the opportunity to appoint federal judges&quot;. In June 2009, after Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor as associate justice, McConnell and Jeff Sessions opined that Sotomayor&#x27;s 17 years as a federal judge and over 3,600 judicial opinions would require lengthy review and advocated against Democrats hastening the confirmation process. On July 17, McConnell announced that he would vote against Sotomayor&#x27;s confirmation. In August, McConnell called Sotomayor &quot;a fine person with an impressive story and a distinguished background&quot; but said he did not believe she would withhold her personal or political views while serving as a justice. Sotomayor was confirmed days later.

In May 2010, after President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to succeed the retiring John Paul Stevens, McConnell said in a Senate speech that Americans wanted to make sure Kagan would be independent of influence from White House as an associate justice and noted that Obama called Kagan a friend of his in announcing her nomination. McConnell announced his opposition to Kagan&#x27;s confirmation, saying she was not forthcoming enough about her &quot;views on basic principles of American constitutional law&quot;. Kagan was confirmed the next month.

In 2014, Republicans gained control of the Senate, and McConnell became majority leader; he used his new power to start what was considered &quot;a near blockade&quot; of Obama&#x27;s judicial appointments. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Obama&#x27;s final two years as president saw 18 district court judges and one appeals court judge confirmed, the fewest since President Harry S. Truman. In comparison, the final two years of the presidencies of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan had between 55 and 70 district court judges each confirmed and between 10 and 15 appeals court judges confirmed. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that McConnell brought about an &quot;extraordinary two-year slowdown in judicial confirmations&quot;, detailing 22 confirmations of Obama&#x27;s judicial nominees, the lowest since Truman in 1951–1952. The number of federal judicial vacancies at the end of Obama&#x27;s term was more than twice the number at the end of George W. Bush&#x27;s term. In a 2019 interview, McConnell credited himself for the large number of judicial vacancies created in the last two years of Obama&#x27;s presidency.

On February 13, 2016, Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died. Shortly thereafter, McConnell issued a statement indicating that the Senate would not consider any Supreme Court nominee Obama put forth. &quot;The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president&quot;, McConnell said. On March 16, 2016, Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, to the Supreme Court. Under McConnell&#x27;s direction, Senate Republicans refused to take any action on the nomination. Garland&#x27;s nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress.

In an August 2016 speech in Kentucky, McConnell said, &quot;one of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, &#x27;Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.&#x27;&quot; In April 2018, McConnell said the decision not to act on Garland&#x27;s nomination was &quot;the most consequential decision I&#x27;ve made in my entire public career&quot;. Political scientists and legal scholars called McConnell&#x27;s refusal to hold Senate hearings on Garland &quot;unprecedented&quot;, a &quot;culmination of [his] confrontational style&quot;, a &quot;blatant abuse of constitutional norms&quot;, and a &quot;classic example of constitutional hardball&quot;.

====Under Trump====
In January 2017, President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left after Scalia&#x27;s death. Gorsuch&#x27;s nomination was confirmed on April 7, 2017, after McConnell eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees.

On July 18, 2018, with Andy Oldham&#x27;s Senate confirmation, Senate Republicans broke a record for largest number of appeals court judiciary confirmations during a president&#x27;s first two years; Oldham became the 23rd appeals court judge confirmed in Trump&#x27;s term. McConnell said he considers the judiciary to be the item of Trump&#x27;s first two years with the longest-lasting impact on the country. The record for the number of circuit court judges confirmed during a president&#x27;s first year was broken in 2017, while the previous two-year record of 22 confirmations took place under President George H. W. Bush. By March 2020, McConnell had contacted an unknown number of judges, encouraging them to retire before the 2020 election. He confirmed 260 federal judges during Trump&#x27;s four-year term, shifting the federal judiciary to the right.
In July 2018, Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. McConnell accused Democrats of creating an &quot;extreme&quot; distortion of Kavanaugh&#x27;s record during his hearings. In September 2018, Christine Blasey Ford publicly alleged that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in 1982. After it was reported that Democrats were investigating a second allegation against Kavanaugh, McConnell said, &quot;I want to make it perfectly clear. ... Judge Kavanaugh will be voted on here on the Senate floor.&quot; Kavanaugh was confirmed on October 6. McConnell said the confirmation process was a low point for the Senate, but also downplayed reports of dysfunction in the Senate; he said claims that the Senate was &quot;somehow broken over this [were] simply inaccurate&quot;.

In October 2018, McConnell said if a Supreme Court vacancy were to occur in 2020, he would not repeat his 2016 decision to let the winner of the upcoming presidential election nominate a justice. He argued that because in 2016 the Senate was controlled by a party other than the president&#x27;s, the 2016 precedent was not applicable in 2020, when Republicans controlled both the presidency and Senate. In September 2020, after Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, he announced the Senate would vote on Trump&#x27;s nominated replacement. On October 23, McConnell set in place the Senate debate on the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ginsburg&#x27;s seat. Barrett was confirmed on October 26.

===Government shutdowns===
The federal government shut down on October 1–17, 2013, after Congress failed to enact legislation to fund it. McConnell later vowed Republicans would not force the U.S. to default on its debt or shut down the government in 2014, when stopgap funding measures were set to expire. He also said he would not allow other Republicans to obstruct the budget-making process.

In July 2018, McConnell said funding for the Mexico–United States border wall would likely have to wait until the midterms had concluded. Trump tweeted two days later that he was willing to allow a government shutdown to get funding. Several spending bills were approved that August; the approvals were seen as a victory for McConnell in his attempts to prevent another government shutdown.

====Shutdown of 2018–2019====
From December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, the federal government shut down when Congress refused to give in to Trump&#x27;s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall. In December 2018, the Republican-controlled Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump appeared likely to approve the bill. After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to &quot;build the wall&quot;, he said he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund the wall.

During this shutdown, McConnell blocked the Senate from voting on appropriations legislation and said it was not his place to mediate between the Senate and Trump. Privately, McConnell had advised Trump against initiating the shutdown. Democrats criticized McConnell for not putting appropriations legislation up for a vote, noting that the Republican-controlled Senate had unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding and that the Senate could override Trump&#x27;s veto.

By January 23, McConnell had blocked four Senate bills to reopen the government and a bill funding the Homeland Security Department through February 8. He called for Democrats to support a Trump administration-backed measure that included $5.7 billion in wall funding, together with a temporary extension of protections for DACA recipients, a Democratic priority. Privately, other Republican senators pressured McConnell to stop blocking appropriations legislation.

The shutdown ended on January 25, when Trump signed a three-week funding measure reopening the government until February 15 without funds for a border wall. This was the longest government shutdown in American history.

===COVID-19 response===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, McConnell initially opposed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, calling it a Democratic &quot;ideological wish list&quot;. He reversed his position when Trump endorsed the proposed package. The bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 90–8.

McConnell also directed Senate Republicans in negotiations for two other COVID-19 response packages: the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 and the CARES Act. The CARES Act was the largest economic stimulus package in U.S. history, amounting to 10% of total U.S. gross domestic product. It passed both houses of Congress with bipartisan support.

Speaking on the Hugh Hewitt radio show on April 22, 2020, McConnell suggested that states should be able to declare bankruptcy instead of receiving additional COVID-19 aid funds—funds he implied would be used to save insolvent state pension funds instead of for COVID-19 relief. His comments were sharply criticized by various state and local officials. States cannot declare bankruptcy.

After the CARES Act passed, McConnell waited several months before advancing any additional COVID-19 relief measures in the Senate, saying in May, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately&quot; and that Congress should &quot;[hit] pause&quot; to evaluate how the allocated funds were working before approving more. He was absent from negotiations between congressional Democrats and White House officials for an additional aid package.

On September 10, 2020, a pared-down COVID-19 relief bill crafted by McConnell failed to pass the Senate because of a Democratic filibuster. Democrats called the bill &quot;completely inadequate&quot; given the scope of the COVID-19 crisis and a partisan maneuver to help Republican senators up for reelection. McConnell called the bill a choice between &quot;do[ing] something&quot; and &quot;do[ing] nothing&quot;, and said he was holding the procedural vote to get lawmakers on the record about their willingness to compromise on COVID-19 legislation.

===Approval ratings===
As the leader of the Senate Republicans, McConnell has received much of the criticism and disapproval that Republicans receive from Democratic voters, receiving near uniform disapproval from left-of-center voters. Furthermore, as a result of his unpopularity with Trump and the more populist base, McConnell has had historically low approval for a senator by the electorate as a whole: a 2012 poll and a 2016 poll each found that McConnell had the lowest home-state approval rating of any sitting senator. With a 49% disapproval rate in 2017, McConnell had the highest disapproval rating of any senator.

In September 2019, the Morning Consult found that McConnell&#x27;s approval rating had been underwater since the first quarter of 2017, when it was 44% positive and 47% negative. The worst rating since that time was in the fourth quarter of 2018, when he had a 38% positive rating and a 47% negative rating among Kentuckians. At that time he was briefly not the least popular senator, surpassed by Claire McCaskill and Jeff Flake. But as of the second quarter of 2019, McConnell&#x27;s ratings were 36% positive and 50% negative. He netted −56 among Democrats, +29 among Republicans, and −24 among Independents. An average of polls by the Economist/YouGov, Politico/Morning Consult, and Harvard-Harris from the end of July through August 2019 (7/31–8/27), was 23% favorable and 48% unfavorable (−25.0 spread).

In 2020, according to Morning Consult, Susan Collins edged out McConnell as the least popular senator with a 52% unfavorable rating from Maine voters compared to 50% for McConnell.

===Committee assignments===
McConnell&#x27;s committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:
* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry
** Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade
** Subcommittee on Conservation, Climate, Forestry, and Natural Resources
** Subcommittee on Food and Nutrition, Specialty Crops, Organics, and Research
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on Defense
** Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development
** Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans&#x27; Affairs, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs
* Committee on Rules and Administration
* Select Committee on Intelligence (&quot;ex officio&quot;)

==Political positions==
McConnell has taken conservative stances for the past several decades. During his Senate tenure, McConnell led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the Supreme Court ruling that partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. He led opposition against Obamacare, first through efforts to delay or prevent the law&#x27;s passage, and later to repeal or replace it, including via the American Healthcare Reform Act. McConnell has opposed stronger regulations, gun control measures and efforts to mitigate climate change. He has criticized proposed legislation by House Democrats such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, and was criticized by Nancy Pelosi for withholding votes on measures passed by the Democratic-controlled House during his time as Senate Majority Leader, including the For the People Act of 2019, the Equality Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act. McConnell has supported stronger border security, free trade agreements and reductions in taxes. As Senate Majority Leader, he led the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018. His foreign policy views have included support of sanctions on Cuba, Iran and Russia, support of Ukraine during its invasion by Russia, opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and support of Israel in its war with Hamas. He voted for the Iraq Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq, and supported the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 in public.

Earlier in his political career, during the 1960s and 1970s, McConnell held moderate stances, including support of abortions, support of unions, and support of the civil rights movement. Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, McConnell expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage stating “I’ve always felt that marriage is between one man and one woman and the Supreme Court has held otherwise. That’s the law of the land.”

==Electoral history==
===1984===
In 1984, McConnell ran for the U.S. Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter Dee Huddleston. The election race was not decided until the last returns came in, when McConnell won by 3,437 votes out of more than 1.2 million votes cast, just over 0.4%. McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan&#x27;s landslide victory in the presidential election.

McConnell&#x27;s campaign was noted for a series of television campaign spots called &quot;Where&#x27;s Dee&quot;, which featured a group of bloodhounds trying to find Huddleston, implying that Huddleston&#x27;s attendance record in the Senate was poor. He was the first Republican to win a statewide election in Kentucky since 1968, and benefited from the popularity of President Ronald Reagan, up for re-election, who was supported by 60% of Kentucky voters in the same year.

===1990===
In 1990, McConnell faced former Louisville Mayor Harvey I. Sloane, winning by 4.4%.

===1996===
In 1996, he defeated Steve Beshear by 12.6%, even as Bill Clinton narrowly carried the state. McConnell&#x27;s campaign ran television ads warning voters to not &quot;Get BeSheared&quot; and included images of sheep being sheared.

===2002===
In 2002, he was unopposed in the Republican primary. He then defeated Lois Combs Weinberg by 29.4%.

===2008===
In 2008, McConnell faced his closest contest since 1990. He defeated Bruce Lunsford by 6%.

===2014===
In 2014, McConnell faced Louisville businessman Matt Bevin in the Republican primary. The 60.2% won by McConnell was the lowest voter support for a Kentucky U.S. senator in a primary since 1938. He faced Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes in the general election, and defeated Grimes, 56.2–40.7%.

===2020===
In the November 2020 general election, McConnell faced Democratic nominee Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot; and Libertarian nominee Brad Barron, a businessman and farmer. During the campaign, McConnell and McGrath agreed to one hour-long, socially distanced debate on October 12. McConnell was elected to his seventh term on November 3 when he defeated McGrath by nearly 20 percentage points.

==Personal life==
=== Family ===
McConnell is a Southern Baptist, baptized at age 8. He was married to his first wife, Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 to 1980 and had three daughters, Porter, Eleanor (Elly), and Claire. Porter McConnell is the campaign director for Take on Wall Street, a left-wing advocacy coalition. Following her divorce from McConnell, Redmon became a feminist scholar at Smith College and director of the Sophia Smith Collection.

McConnell&#x27;s second wife, whom he married in 1993, is Elaine Chao, Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush and Secretary of Transportation under President Donald Trump.

In May 2019, McConnell&#x27;s brother-in-law Gordon Hartogensis, who is married to Chao&#x27;s sister Grace, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a part of the Labor Department. McConnell voted to confirm.

=== Health ===
McConnell&#x27;s upper left leg was paralyzed during his childhood by polio.

In February 2003, McConnell underwent a triple heart bypass surgery in relation to blocked arteries, at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. 

In August 2019, McConnell suffered a fall at his Louisville home; he fractured his shoulder. In March 2023, he was hospitalized for five days after a fall; he was treated for a concussion and a minor rib fracture, and did not return to the Senate for almost six weeks. In July 2023, he fell while disembarking from a plane at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. On December 10, 2024, McConnell sustained a fall during a Senate Republican Conference policy luncheon, spraining his wrist and cutting his face.

On July 26, 2023, McConnell prompted worldwide media reports when he froze, unspeaking, for around 20 seconds while addressing a press conference. He was escorted away by aides, but later returned and said he was &quot;fine&quot;. Two days after the incident, his spokespersons said that McConnell would continue in his leadership role; he is the institution&#x27;s longest-serving party leader. On August 30, 2023, he again froze during a press conference in Covington, Kentucky and was eventually led away by staff. A day later, McConnell released a letter from the attending physician of Congress that said that he was &quot;medically clear&quot; to continue his schedule as planned; the letter said that the physician had talked to McConnell and &quot;conferred with his neurology team&quot;, but did not indicate that he had physically examined McConnell.

=== Other ===
In 1997, McConnell founded the James Madison Center for Free Speech, a legal-defense organization based in Washington, D.C. He was inducted into the Sons of the American Revolution on March 1, 2013. He is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.

In 2018, the OpenSecrets website ranked McConnell one of the wealthiest members of the U.S. Senate, with a net worth of more than $25 million. His personal wealth grew in 2008, when he and his wife received a gift worth about $5 million to about $25 million from her father, James S. C. Chao, after the death of his wife.

==In popular culture==
McConnell&#x27;s detractors have called him by a number of nicknames, including &quot;Moscow Mitch&quot;, &quot;Cocaine Mitch&quot;, the &quot;Grim Reaper&quot;, &quot;Darth Vader&quot;, &quot;Rich Mitch&quot;, &quot;Nuclear Mitch&quot;, &quot;Midnight Mitch&quot;, and &quot;Old Crow&quot;. McConnell embraces several of them, but he has objected strenuously to &quot;Moscow Mitch&quot;.

Jon Stewart repeatedly mocked McConnell on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; for resembling a turtle or tortoise. McConnell has been portrayed by Beck Bennett in sketches on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 2017, McConnell was portrayed satirically in &quot;South Park&quot;″s season 21 episode &quot;Doubling Down&quot;.

During the 2014 election campaign, McConnell was lampooned for posting campaign B-roll footage online for use by allied PACs. Various Internet posters satirically interspersed the B-roll with footage from sitcoms and movies and with popular music. The practice of posting B-roll footage online for use by PACs or of lampooning the B-roll was termed &quot;McConnelling&quot;.

In 2015, 2019, and 2023, &quot;Time&quot; listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

<doc id="350568" wikidata="Q476995" url="?curid=350568" title="Henry Morgentaler">
<text>Henekh &quot;Henry&quot; Morgentaler (March 19, 1923 – May 29, 2013), was a Polish-born Canadian physician, and abortion rights advocate who fought numerous legal battles aimed at expanding abortion rights in Canada. As a Jewish youth during World War II, Morgentaler was imprisoned at the Łódź Ghetto and later at the Dachau concentration camp.

After the war, Morgentaler migrated to Canada and entered medical practice, becoming one of the first Canadian doctors to perform vasectomies, to insert intrauterine devices, and to provide birth control pills to unmarried women. He opened his first abortion clinic in 1969 in Montreal, challenging what he saw as an unjust law placing burdensome restrictions on women seeking abortions. He was the first doctor in North America to use vacuum aspiration and went on to open twenty clinics and train more than one hundred doctors. Morgentaler was jailed in 1975 for defying abortion law when the Quebec Court of Appeal overturned a jury&#x27;s acquittal. The resulting Morgentaler Amendment to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; restricted appeal courts from overturning acquittals. Morgentaler twice challenged the constitutionality of the federal abortion law, losing the first time, in &quot;Morgentaler v R&quot; in 1975, but winning the second time, in &quot;R v Morgentaler&quot; in 1988.

In 2008, Morgentaler was awarded the Order of Canada &quot;for his commitment to increased health care options for women, his determined efforts to influence Canadian public policy and his leadership in humanist and civil liberties organizations.&quot; Morgentaler died at the age of 90 of a heart attack.

==Life==
Morgentaler was born in Łódź, Poland, about southwest of Warsaw, to Josef and Golda Morgentaler. Before World War II, Morgentaler&#x27;s father was active in the General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland. During the German occupation of Poland, a Jewish ghetto in Łódź was created and Jews were not allowed to leave it. Morgentaler&#x27;s father was killed by the Gestapo, while Henry lived with his mother and younger brother in the Ghetto Litzmannstadt with 164,000 others. His sister had left for Warsaw with her husband before the start of the war. She was incarcerated there at the Warsaw Ghetto, and took part in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. She was killed at the Treblinka extermination camp.

When the Germans raided the Ghetto in Łódź with the help of the Jewish Ghetto Police,&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishgen/timeline&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Rosenfarbs and the Morgentalers (Golda and her sons Henry and Abraham) along with two other families hid in a room with the door concealed by a wardrobe. After two days in hiding, on August 23, 1942, they were found and deported to Auschwitz concentration camp. The boys never saw their mother again: Golda was murdered at Auschwitz. On August 27, Henry and Abraham were shipped to KL Landsberg, Dachau concentration camp, where they both remained until the end of the war. In February 1943, Henry was sent to KL Kaufering (a satellite camp of Dachau concentration camp). By the end of the war, he was in sick bay (&quot;Krankenrevier&quot;), whence he was finally liberated by the U.S. Army on April 29, 1945. After his release at age 22 Henry weighed just . He entered a Displaced Persons Hospital in Landsberg am Lech. After a few months there he was moved to a DP Hospital in St. Ottilien, and thence with Abraham to Feldafing, a Displaced Persons Camp, in Bavaria.

===After the war===
In 1946, Abraham emigrated to the United States. In 1947, Henry made his way to Brussels in Belgium, where he rejoined his friends the Rosenfarbs. Because they were not in Belgium legally, he and his fiancée, Chava Rosenfarb, were required to emigrate. Chava&#x27;s sister, Henia Reinhartz, in her Memoir, &quot;Bits and Pieces,&quot; described the harsh economic conditions while the family, and Henry, lived in Brussels. One picture shows Henia, Chava, and their mother wearing coats made from blankets donated by UNRRA. In 1949, Henry and Chava married. They left Europe in February 1950 on the &quot;RMS Samaria (1920)&quot; sailing to Canada.

The couple settled in Montréal, where Chava resumed her vocation as a writer. Several months later their first child, Goldie, was born. Their second child was a son, Abraham. Henry was, by his own admission, a proud womanizer. Their marriage ended in divorce in the mid-1970s. Chava died on January 30, 2011.

==Career==
Morgentaler received his medical education from the Université de Montréal, graduating in 1953. After receiving his Canadian citizenship, he practised medicine in the east end of Montreal. He started as a general practitioner in 1955 but increasingly specialized in family planning, becoming one of the first Canadian doctors to perform vasectomies, to insert intra-uterine devices, and to provide birth control pills to unmarried women.

On October 17, 1967, he presented a brief on behalf of the Humanist Association of Canada before a House of Commons Health and Welfare Committee that was investigating the issue of illegal abortion. Morgentaler stated that women should have the right to safe abortion. The reaction to his public testimony surprised him: he began to receive calls from women who wanted abortions. Robert Malcolm Campbell and Leslie Alexander Pal wrote, &quot;Henry Morgentaler experienced the [abortion] law&#x27;s limitations directly in the supplications of desperate women who visited his Montreal office.&quot; Morgentaler&#x27;s initial response was to refuse:
&quot;I hadn&#x27;t expected the avalanche of requests and didn&#x27;t realize the magnitude of the problem in immediate, human terms. I answered, &#x27;I sympathize with you. I know your problem, but the law won&#x27;t let me help you. If I do help you, I&#x27;ll go to jail, I lose my practice—I have a wife and two children. I&#x27;m sorry, but I just can&#x27;t!&#x27;&quot;
For a time he was able to refer the women to two other doctors who did abortions, but they became unavailable. There was no one to whom he could send them, and some of them were ending up in the emergency department after amateur abortions. He has said that he felt like a coward for sending them away and that he was shirking his responsibility. Eventually, in spite of the risks to himself—loss of career, a prison term for years or for life—he decided to perform abortions and, at the same time, challenge the law. He knew from other doctors and from newspaper reports that women in Montreal had died from incompetently performed abortions. He knew that the women were determined to get abortions in spite of the danger to their health and lives. He knew that he could prevent those unnecessary deaths, so he determined to use civil disobedience to change the law.

In 1968, Morgentaler gave up his family practice and began performing abortions in his private clinic. He devoted his clinic to performing abortions on women as well as providing birth control and contraceptives, though it was illegal at the time. At the time, abortion was illegal except for cases in which continuing a pregnancy threatened the life of the pregnant woman. On August 26, 1969, an amendment to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; legalized abortion in Canada if performed in a hospital after approval of a Therapeutic Abortion Committee. There was, however, no requirement for a hospital to set up a committee and only about one-third of hospitals did. This left many areas without legal abortion, forcing women to travel and inducing barriers and delays. Some committees never met. Even if they did, they never saw their &quot;patient&quot; and yet her fate was determined by their subjective opinions. In addition, there was no appeal of a TAC&#x27;s decision. Morgentaler&#x27;s abortions remained illegal under the new law because he did not submit them in advance to a TAC for approval; they became legal in 1988, when section 251 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; (now known as section 287) was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada.

In 1983, Morgentaler debated former abortion doctor Bernard Nathanson for an hour on a Canadian national superstation.

After Quebec stopped prosecuting him in 1976, Morgentaler opened an abortion clinic in Ontario. In spite of prosecutions, other provinces followed. In 2003, he was able to close his Halifax clinics because a doctor that he trained was now performing abortions at a local hospital, QEII Health Sciences Centre.

In 2006, Morgentaler had to stop performing abortions after undergoing a heart bypass surgery. He continued, however, to oversee the operation of his six private clinics.

==Judicial battles==

===Quebec===
In 1969, Morgentaler opened an abortion clinic in Montreal. He said that he applied for status as a model abortion clinic and proposed to the federal and provincial governments that abortions could be safely done outside hospitals. He recounts that neither the provincial nor the federal government was interested. Each said it was the other&#x27;s responsibility. No one came to inspect the clinic. Instead, they sent the police. On June 1, 1970, Montreal city police raided Morgentaler&#x27;s clinic and laid several charges of performing illegal abortions. The first case did not come to trial until 1973; in the meantime, women&#x27;s groups organized in support of Morgentaler and he continued to perform abortions. In 1973, the doctor stated that he had performed 5,000 safe abortions outside hospitals, demonstrating that a hospital setting was not necessary.

Between 1973 and 1975, Morgentaler was tried three times in Montreal for defying the abortion law; each time, he raised the defence of necessity, and each time he was acquitted. Each time, the jury took less time to reach their decision to acquit: at the third trial, they took one hour. This is called jury nullification—the refusal of juries to enforce a law that they perceive to be unjust.

Each charge was brought to trial separately. At the trial of the first charge in 1973, Morgentaler was defended by Claude-Armand Sheppard. Sheppard presented the &quot;defence of necessity&quot;—as a doctor, Morgentaler had a duty to safeguard the life and health of the women who came to him for abortions, which outweighed his duty to obey the law. After hearing some of those women as witnesses, the jury acquitted him.

The province appealed the acquittal. The jury&#x27;s acquittal was overturned by five judges on the Quebec Court of Appeal in 1974, who substituted a conviction. The doctor appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Canada, but the court upheld his conviction in a 6–3 decision, stating that the danger to women was not immediate. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison and began serving his sentence in March 1975.

In 1975, under Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the Canadian Parliament changed the law so that an appeals court could not overturn a jury acquittal, although they could order a new trial. This is known as the Morgentaler Amendment to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. The Quebec government set aside their first conviction and ordered a new trial on the first charge. Morgentaler was released to await trial.

In 1975, while he was in prison, the Ministry of Justice for Quebec laid a second set of charges against him and he was acquitted by another jury. He was, however, already in jail. A political cartoon at the time showed a prison guard pushing Morgentaler&#x27;s food tray into his cell and saying, &quot;Congratulations, doctor, you&#x27;ve been acquitted again!&quot; The Ministry of Justice appealed this second acquittal but this time, the Quebec Court of Appeal unanimously upheld the acquittal (January 19, 1976).

Morgentaler was not released on parole after serving one-third of his sentence, six months. In total, he served ten months, suffering a heart attack while in solitary confinement, after which he was released to hospital. It was reported that the Liberal Justice Minister for Quebec, Jérôme Choquette, was deeply involved and interested in prosecuting Morgentaler until he was removed from the portfolio.

In January 1976, a third trial was begun against Morgentaler on the first set of charges. On 18 September 1976, the trial ended in an acquittal by a different jury. This was his third jury acquittal in Quebec. 

The 1976 Quebec general election brought the Parti Québécois into power. They realized that the abortion law could not be enforced if juries would not convict, so they dropped the remaining charges. On December 11, 1976, the new Justice Minister, Marc-André Bédard, dropped the charges against Morgentaler and other doctors and announced that there would be no further trials for clinic abortions in Quebec. This was just in time to prevent a fourth Morgentaler trial from starting the following Monday.

Bédard called the anti-abortion law unenforceable. From that point on, Quebec refused to enforce federal law prohibiting abortions by qualified medical personnel. Bédard emphasized that police would continue to identify and charge unqualified, back-street abortionists. Federal Justice Minister Ron Basford said that Quebec had made a just and fair decision that was proper to the provincial authority. Quebec Justice Minister Bedford asked Federal Justice Minister Basford to amend Section 251 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;.

Later in 1976, the Attorney General for Quebec announced that thenceforward abortions performed by doctors in free-standing clinics were legal in the province.

In 1976, Morgentaler went to the Supreme Court of Canada in an attempt to overturn the country&#x27;s abortion law in &quot;Morgentaler v. The Queen&quot; but was unsuccessful. In 1982, the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; was enacted as part of the Canadian Constitution. The Charter was relevant to Morgentaler&#x27;s later court cases.

==CARAL==
In 1974, a group of abortion rights activists founded the Canadian Association for the Repeal of the Abortion Law (CARAL) in Ottawa. The aim of CARAL was to support Morgentaler&#x27;s challenge of the 1969 abortion law requiring approval of a Therapeutic Abortion Committee (TAC) before an abortion could be legally performed (without requiring TACs to be formed or to meet). The organization formed provincial and local chapters across Canada and helped to raise funds for Morgentaler&#x27;s legal fees. The group also supported Morgentaler&#x27;s use of vacuum aspiration under local anesthetic as safer and less invasive than the dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) that was traditionally performed at hospitals for abortions or after miscarriages. The development of medical abortion has also reduced maternal mortality associated with non-medically assisted abortions.

===Other provinces and Canada===
Encouraged by public support for his struggle and concern about women&#x27;s access to abortion in other provinces, in 1983 Morgentaler decided to challenge the law in other provinces. He spent the next 15 years opening and running abortion clinics across Canada, in clear violation of the law. In each province, he announced in advance that he would open a clinic. That year, he opened clinics in Winnipeg and Toronto.

By this point, the tide of public opinion had turned in Morgentaler&#x27;s favour: A Gallup poll in 1983 showed that 72% of Canadians believed that the decision to abort should rest solely with a pregnant woman and her doctor.

The Toronto clinic was operated with two colleagues, Leslie Frank Smoling and Robert Scott. In 1983, Toronto Police raided Morgentaler&#x27;s newly opened clinic and he and his two colleagues were charged with providing illegal miscarriages. Once again Morgentaler used the defence of necessity and was acquitted by the jury. The Attorney General&#x27;s office appealed the acquittal and the verdict was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which directed a new trial. Once again, an appeal court had overturned a jury acquittal. Once again, Morgentaler appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. This time, Morgentaler challenged the law as unconstitutional on the grounds that it denied women the right to life, liberty, and security of the person. At all levels (jury trial, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court), Morgentaler was represented by Ontario constitutional lawyer Morris Manning.

The appeal case, &quot;R v. Morgentaler&quot;, 1988, was heard by the Supreme Court of Canada. It was a victory for Morgentaler. The court upheld the original jury acquittal. In addition, it declared that the 1969 abortion law violated the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and was thus unconstitutional in the case of &quot;R. v. Morgentaler&quot; 1988 (1 S.C.R. 30). The court ruled 5–2 that the administrative procedures were cumbersome and unjustifiably interfered with the body integrity of women.&quot; On January 28, the law was found to violate Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms because it infringes upon a woman&#x27;s right to &quot;life, liberty and security of the person.&quot;

The five justices wrote three different opinions striking down the law for different reasons: that Section 251 imposed unnecessary procedures and restrictions, restricted access to hospitals, and caused delays; resulted in physical, psychological and emotional risk to the woman; and forced some women to carry a fetus to term against their will.

Chief Justice Brian Dickson wrote:

&quot;Forcing a woman, by threat of criminal sanction, to carry a fetus to term unless she meets certain criteria unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations, is a profound interference with a woman&#x27;s body and thus a violation of her security of the person.&quot; 

Justice Bertha Wilson wrote:

&quot;The decision of a woman to terminate her pregnancy falls within the class of protected decisions [because it will have] profound psychological, economic and social consequences for the pregnant woman ... The right to reproduce or not to reproduce ... is properly perceived as an integral part of modern woman’s struggle to assert her dignity and worth as a human being ... The purpose of [section 251] is to take the decision away from the woman and give it to a committee.&quot;

Thus the court concurred with Morgentaler&#x27;s reasoning. The Supreme Court ruling essentially ended all criminal restrictions that singled out abortion in Canada for special treatment, leaving it to be governed by Canada&#x27;s laws concerning medical practice. The &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;, provincial medical regulations, and health insurance restrictions still applied. In particular, provinces could refuse to pay for clinic abortions; but they could not demand that TACs be used to screen the procedures for approval, nor could they forbid abortion outright. Morgentaler has described this as the happiest day of his life.

The courts also reviewed various attempts by provinces and municipalities to use laws about medical services to restrict or hamper the ability of pregnant women to exercise a right of choice. All such attempts were denied by the courts. Anti-abortion forces resorted to political attempts to deny funding to private abortion clinics and to ban the establishment of clinics within provinces.

In 1989, Nova Scotia took one day to pass a law that banned abortions and some other procedures such as liposuction outside hospitals, making all clinic abortions illegal or at least unfunded. Morgentaler opened a clinic, supposedly to interview clients for abortions outside the province. Then he announced that he had performed abortions there. The government laid a charge of violating the Nova Scotia &quot;Medical Services Act&quot;, 1989. Nova Scotia then sought an injunction to stop Morgentaler from performing clinic abortions. The injunction was granted on the ground that there was an overwhelming need to ensure that provincial laws are respected. It rejected the argument that the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1988 decision in R. v. Morgentaler prohibited provinces from passing laws that simply made clinic abortions illegal.

To fight the charges and the injunction, Morgentaler challenged the constitutionality of the Nova Scotia &quot;Medical Services Act&quot;. In 1993, the case came before the Supreme Court of Canada. The province argued that it was combating the privatization of health services. The court, however, unanimously struck down that part of the Act that forbade procedures in clinics. Justice John Sopinka wrote the decision, which agreed that these abortion regulations were not a valid provincial regulation of hospitals and medicine, but an invalid criminal law: only the federal government can make criminal law. As a result, all of the regulations were struck down, including the ones not dealing with abortion, which the court called a smokescreen for the province&#x27;s true purpose of stopping women from having abortions. (See &quot;R. v. Morgentaler (1993).&quot;)

In June 1991, the Ontario government announced that all abortions in the province, including clinic abortions, would be covered by the Ontario Health Insurance Plan. Women would not have to pay out of pocket for clinic abortions, as they did in other provinces. The Ontario Ministry of Health announced that they would be working with the medical profession to ensure that enough doctors were trained and would perform abortions to keep up with the demand from Ontario women.

In 1994 New Brunswick banned abortions in clinics outside hospitals. In 1995 abortion was added to the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; as an essential medical service, meaning that it must be covered by health insurance. Nevertheless, some provinces do not cover clinic abortions.

In 1995, provincial and federal rulings forced Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to allow private abortion clinics. The Alberta government was penalized under the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; for not funding abortions in clinics, but instead allowing private billing at provincial abortion clinics. In 1996 Alberta gave in to the financial pressure and agreed to fund the clinics.

In 1996, Morgentaler wrote &quot;The Moral Case for Abortion.&quot; In it, he gives the reasoning that guided his actions from the first abortions in Quebec and fuelled his defence of necessity in providing women with abortions. This was, in essence, the reason that Quebec juries would not convict him:

Have all these people forgotten that women used to die in our countries from self-induced or quack abortions, that unwanted children were given away to institutions where they suffered enormous trauma that took the joy of life away from them and made them into anxious, depressed individuals with a grudge against society? Have all these people forgotten that an unwanted pregnancy was the biggest health hazard to young fertile women and could result in loss of fertility, long-term illness, injury, and death?

While no precise figures exist, it is estimated that approximately 4,000 to 6,000 Canadian women died from illegal abortions between 1926 and 1947. This lesson was reinforced in 1990 by the Progressive Conservative government&#x27;s attempt to recriminalize abortion. A conservative federal government, led by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, introduced Bill C-43, which would punish doctors with prison terms if they performed abortions for women whose health was not at risk. It passed the House of Commons by a close vote of 140–131 in a blaze of publicity. It was not yet law, but within a week a 20-year-old university student bled to death in residence from a self-induced coat hanger abortion. A teenage girl was injured in a botched back-alley abortion. These casualties of unwanted pregnancy received considerable publicity and abortion rights demonstrations were held after the death of the student, protesting Bill C-43. The bill was defeated in the Senate by a tie vote in early 1991 and the casualties of illegal abortion ceased.

Morgentaler&#x27;s final legal battles focused on obtaining universal public funding for abortions, by gaining recognition that a well-regulated specialist clinic provides a service equivalent to that offered in a hospital. In New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, for example, the provincial health care system paid for abortions only if they were performed at authorized hospitals and approved by two physicians. Morgentaler challenged this policy in New Brunswick.

In 2008, the challenge was before the courts. The province originally stated that women could get medically necessary abortions at New Brunswick hospitals. In 2006 however the last hospital in New Brunswick to perform publicly funded abortions, the Dr. Everett Chalmers Hospital in Fredericton, announced that it would suspend abortion services as of July 1, citing workload problems. New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are the only provinces in Canada that refuse to pay for abortions in clinics. This rule violates the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; as well as the 1988 Supreme Court Morgentaler Decision. The province argued that Morgentaler could not have standing because only a woman who needed to use the clinic had the right to challenge abortion policy. The New Brunswick Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench ruled that Morgentaler had standing to proceed with a lawsuit against the government. That leaves the Morgentaler clinic in Fredericton, where women can obtain abortions by paying up to $750.

Judge Paulette Garnett said that Morgentaler should have legal standing to proceed with the lawsuit because the personal nature of abortions – and the fact the procedures are time-sensitive – make it difficult for women to take the government before the courts. After the ruling, the government considered whether it should appeal.

In 2009, Morgentaler was working to open two private abortion clinics in the Canadian Arctic so that women who live there do not have to travel vast distances to obtain abortions.

==Death threats, assaults, and bombings==
There were many instances of anti-abortion violence against Morgentaler, his staff, his patients, and his colleagues. Anti-abortion violence is described by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service as single-issue terrorism. Death threats against Morgentaler were frequent. In the 1980s, a reporter said that the stack of death threats for a single month was six inches (roughly 15 cm) thick. In 1983 a man attacked him with garden shears outside of his Toronto abortion clinic. Judy Rebick blocked the attack and Morgentaler remained unharmed. Augusto Dantas was charged with assault and with possession of a weapon dangerous to the public good. On July 29, 1983, protesters attempted to firebomb his clinic; the clinic suffered only minor damage, but the neighbouring Toronto Women&#x27;s Bookstore was nearly destroyed.

In May 1992, the Morgentaler Clinic on Harbord Street in Toronto was firebombed during the night by two people (caught on security camera) using gasoline as fuel and a firework to set off the explosion. The next day, clinic management announced that the firebombing failed to prevent any abortions since all scheduled abortions were carried out in alternative locations. No one was hurt but the building had to be demolished. The Women&#x27;s Bookstore next door was also damaged. As a result of the arson, the Ontario government decided to spend $420,000 on improved security for abortion clinics. At the time, all four free-standing clinics in Ontario were in Toronto. The government wanted to gather information about activities by anti-abortion sympathizers; at the time, law enforcement agencies in Canada did not collect statistics about harassment and violence against abortion providers, their clinics, or their clients.

After sniper attacks on other doctors such as Garson Romalis and Hugh Short, abortion providers in Canada were aware that their own lives could be in danger from anti-abortion assassins with high-powered rifles.

The murder of Doctor Barnett Slepian in Buffalo on October 23, 1998, also by a high-powered rifle, reinforced the threats. Abortion doctors wore bullet-proof vests and pulled their curtains to prevent assassins from shooting into their homes. Morgentaler was quoted as saying, &quot;I know of anecdotal evidence that some doctors are considering that they might not be able to continue. It&#x27;s a very bad situation.&quot; He said that he would go on performing abortions. Morgentaler believed that the attacker was an American and that the attacks were an unwanted byproduct of the vitriolic, religiously fuelled abortion battle in the United States. He stated, &quot;In Canada, you have fewer religious fanatics, there is much less violence in Canada and it&#x27;s a much more tolerant society.&quot;

In response to the stabbing of Garson Romalis in 2000, Morgentaler said that some doctors in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland had stopped doing abortions. &quot;For years, we have been living in the shadow of the doctors being killed&quot;, said Morgentaler. &quot;This violence is a sign of frustration, rage and moral bankruptcy in the anti-abortion movement.&quot;

==Other legal troubles==
In 1976, the Disciplinary Committee of the Professional Corporation of Physicians of Quebec suspended Morgentaler&#x27;s medical licence for a year as a result of his conviction for having performed an illegal abortion. As he operated outside hospitals and without a Therapeutic Abortion Committee, all his abortions were illegal. According to Catherine Dunphy&#x27;s 1996 biography of Morgentaler, the committee &quot;commented on &#x27;an attitude which is primarily directed to protecting his fees. No really valid interview is held before proceeding with the abortion. This behaviour confers a mercenary character in the doctor-patient relationship. This committee is incapable of reconciling this behaviour with the humanitarian concern that the accused invoked throughout his defence.&#x27;&quot;

The &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; reported in 1974, that according to police evidence, Morgentaler was re-using disposable vacurettes, against the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions which stated that they &quot;cannot be re-used&quot;. &quot;The Gazette&quot; reported that when contacted, Morgentaler stated that earlier model Vacurettes &quot;could occasionally be used more than once&quot;, but he insisted that &quot;whether someone uses a Vacurette once or twice has nothing to do with practising good medicine.&quot; A 1991 &quot;Alberta Report&quot; article reports that he now denied having re-used vacurettes, but it also reported that according to &quot;The Gazette&quot;&#x27;s lawyers, Morgentaler never took any legal action against that paper.

In 1973, on the basis of Morgentaler&#x27;s public statements that he had performed thousands of abortions, the Quebec Ministry of Revenue ordered him to pay $354,799 in unpaid income taxes. Morgentaler settled out of court a few years later, paying $101,000.

==Honours and awards==
Morgentaler was the first president of the Humanist Association of Canada (HAC) from 1968 to 1999. He remained the organization&#x27;s honorary president until his death in 2013. The HAC bestowed on him its Lifetime Achievement Award on August 3, 2008, in Toronto, Ontario, during its 40th-anniversary celebration convention, the largest Humanist convention in the nation&#x27;s history.

In 1973, Morgentaler was one of the signers of the second Humanist Manifesto. The American Humanist Association named him the 1975 Humanist of the Year, along with Betty Friedan, author of &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;.

In 1989 Morgentaler received the &quot;Maggie&quot; Award, the highest honour of the Planned Parenthood Federation, in tribute to their founder, Margaret Sanger.

On June 16, 2005, the University of Western Ontario conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree upon Morgentaler; this was his first honorary degree. This decision by UWO&#x27;s senate honorary degrees committee generated opposition from Canadian anti-abortion organizations. 12,000 signatures were acquired on a petition asking the UWO to reverse its decision to honour Morgentaler and several protest rallies were held, including one on the day the honorary degree was bestowed. A counter-petition, supporting the UWO&#x27;s decision, gained over 10,000 signatures.

On August 5, 2005, Morgentaler received the Couchiching Award for Public Policy Leadership for his efforts on behalf of women&#x27;s rights and reproductive health issues. The Award was given by the Couchiching Institute on Public Affairs at its 74th annual summer conference. The Couchiching Award for Public Policy Leadership is presented annually to a nationally recognised Canadian who has demonstrated public policy leadership that results in a positive impact on Canada or a community within Canada, often in the face of public opposition. In part, the citation reads
The women’s movement of the 1960s found in Dr. Morgentaler a person who understood that women’s equality could not be achieved within the existing restrictions on medical services for reproductive choice. In offering women access to necessary services that faced considerable restriction elsewhere, Dr. Morgentaler used both his professional status and personal skills to fight for women’s rights, while placing himself at risk. His actions have brought about fundamental changes in Canadian law and to the health care system and in so doing dramatically affected for the better the lives of Canadians from coast to coast.
The Canadian Labour Congress recognized him on May 28, 2008, with its highest honour, the Award for Outstanding Service to Humanity. The CLC&#x27;s description reads
Morgentaler, 85 and frail, accepted the award from the Officers of the Canadian Labour Congress and thanked the unions for standing with him through his many years of struggle to secure for women the right to control their own health and their own bodies. Choice and freedom. 
On this occasion, Morgentaler said, &quot;We must remain vigilant in defence of a woman&#x27;s right to choose because there are still too many legislators and health care providers out there who are not pro-choice and too many women who continue to have their health put at risk because they are denied access to safe abortion services in a supportive environment – twenty years after Canada’s abortion laws were struck down.&quot;

In 2010, Morgentaler was nominated for a Transformational Canadians award as a person who has &quot;made a difference by immeasurably improving the lives of others.&quot; The news item says, &quot;In Canada, a woman can have an abortion without fear of prosecution or imprisonment – for the simple reason that there is no abortion law. For more than 20 years, that state of affairs has set us apart from the rest of the developed world. Canadian women enjoy the right to safe and legal abortions largely because Henry Morgentaler fought a long battle on their behalf. For his trouble, the unflappable Dr. Morgentaler stood trial, languished in prison, and received numerous death threats. What drove him to take such risks? &quot;The realization that a terrible injustice was being done to women and the conviction that it was necessary to change the situation to provide help for those who needed it,&quot; replies the retired physician via email.&quot;

===Order of Canada===
Morgentaler was named a Member of the Order of Canada on July 1, 2008; he was recognized &quot;for his commitment to increased health care options for women, his determined efforts to influence Canadian public policy and his leadership in humanist and civil liberties organizations.&quot; Abortion-rights activists applauded the decision, saying Morgentaler put his life and liberty on the line to advance women&#x27;s rights, while anti-abortion groups strongly criticized the award, saying it debased the Order of Canada. Feminist and author Judy Rebick told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that it was time Morgentaler was honoured for his long battle; she said &quot;Dr. Morgentaler is a hero to millions of women in the country,&quot; she said. &quot;He risked his life to struggle for women&#x27;s rights … He&#x27;s a huge figure in Canadian history and the fact that he hasn&#x27;t got [the Order of Canada] until now is a scandal.&quot;

On the matter, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said he would rather see the country&#x27;s then highest civilian award &quot;be something that really unifies&quot; and &quot;brings Canadians together&quot;, while Liberal Party leader Stéphane Dion said, &quot;Dr. Morgentaler has stood up for a woman’s right to choose for his entire career, often at great personal risk&quot;, and asked Canadians to respect and celebrate the decision.

Several members of the order said they would return their insigniae to Rideau Hall in protest, including Roman Catholic priest Lucien Larré; Gilbert Finn, former Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick; Frank Chauvin, a retired police detective who founded an orphanage; and the Madonna House Apostolate on behalf of the late Catherine Doherty.
Also in 2008, Canadian bishops unanimously stated that they were opposed to the appointment of the abortion provider and pro-choice advocate Henry Morgentaler to the Order of Canada, directly quoting from the Compendium of Social Doctrine. Moreover, the bishops generally advocate pro-life views through the Catholic Organization for Life and Family, the official episcopal agency dedicated to life issues.

On June 1, 2009, three members did leave the order in protest against Morgentaler&#x27;s admission, including the Archbishop of Montreal, Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte. Turcotte explained his resignation to the CBC, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m worried about how we treat life, from conception to death. I decided to take a stance that clearly reflects my convictions.&quot; The others were astronomer René Racine and pianist and conductor Jacqueline Richard, both from Montreal. In November 2009, engineer Renato Giuseppe Bosisio also resigned his membership in protest. About a dozen people picketed outside the ceremony in Quebec City.

==Other activities==
Morgentaler&#x27;s campaign for women&#x27;s reproductive health took him across Canada on speaking engagements and fund-raising tours to promote family planning. In 1972, Morgentaler ran in the Federal Election in the riding of Saint-Denis as an independent, finishing fourth with 1,509 votes. In 1999, Morgentaler said that a decline in youth crime rates could be credited to the legalization of abortion nearly twenty years earlier, leading to fewer neglected and angry children and more mothers surviving to nurture their children. In 2006, Morgentaler retired from active practice.

In August 2011, Morgentaler attended the funeral of Opposition Leader Jack Layton, leader of the New Democratic Party. In the 1980s, Layton attended clinic defences of the Morgentaler clinics, when abortion rights supporters guarded the entrance of a clinic to keep abortion opponents from blockading the doorways to stop patients from entering. The NDP has been a supporter of abortion rights, making them part of its political platform for many years.

In 1991, he debated William Lane Craig in a debate &#x27;Humanism vs Christianity&#x27;.

==Media and cultural representations==
Morgentaler was the subject of a 1984 National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Democracy on Trial: The Morgentaler Affair&quot;, directed by Paul Cowan.

In 2005, the CTV television network produced a television movie documenting Morgentaler&#x27;s life and practice called &quot;Choice: The Henry Morgentaler Story&quot;. The movie is described thus: &quot;It chronicles how the physician defiantly began his fight for women&#x27;s reproductive rights in 1967, even serving time in a Quebec prison in 1975 on abortion charges. The story culminates with the Supreme Court of Canada deciding to strike down this country&#x27;s abortion laws in 1988.&quot; In an interview with CTV, Morgentaler explains: &quot;I got involved because this was, for me, a fight for justice, for fundamental justice, and the fact that I could possibly do something to help women in spite of a law which did not allow me to do it.&quot; &quot;I was willing to go to jail, I was willing to die for it,&quot; he told CTV&#x27;s Canada AM Wednesday. &quot;So when I look back on it, I look at a life of achievement because I achieved a great deal and I&#x27;m very proud of it.&quot;

A famous &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; editorial cartoon by Terry Mosher lampooned Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau&#x27;s prediction that &quot;the Montreal Olympics can no more have a deficit, than a man can have a baby.&quot; After the financially disastrous 1976 Summer Olympics, he drew a cartoon of a pregnant Drapeau placing a telephone call to Morgentaler.

The alternative rock band Me Mom and Morgentaler used the doctor as the inspiration for its name.

==Biology==
* July 23 – Horace Donisthorpe first discovers &quot;Anergates atratulus&quot; in the New Forest, England.
* Reginald Punnett is appointed as first Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics in the University of Cambridge (U.K.), probably the oldest chair of genetics in the English-speaking world.

==Chemistry==
* Peter Debye derives the T-cubed law for the low temperature heat capacity of a nonmetallic solid.
* Casimir Funk introduces the concept of vitamins.
* J. J. Thomson finds the first evidence for multiple isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays (positive ions).
* Fritz Klatte, a German chemist working for Griesheim-Elektron, discovers polyvinyl acetate and applies for a patent for preparing the monomer, vinyl acetate, by addition of acetic acid to acetylene using a mercuric chloride catalyst although it is not successfully commercialized at this time.
* Wilbur Scoville devises the Scoville scale for measuring the heat of peppers.
* December 24 – Merck files patent applications for synthesis of the entactogenic drug MDMA, developed by Anton Köllisch.

==Exploration==
* January 17 – British polar explorer Robert Falcon Scott and a team of four reach the South Pole to find that Amundsen has beaten them to it. They will die on the return journey, just eleven miles from a polar base (March 16–29).
* March 7 – Roald Amundsen announces in Hobart that his expedition reached the South Pole on last December 14.

==History of science==
* November 20 – History of Medicine Society holds its first meeting, under the chairmanship of Sir William Osler, in London.

* Karl F. Sundman solves the &quot;n&quot;-body problem for &quot;n&quot;=3.
* Axel Thue discovers Pisot–Vijayaraghavan numbers.

==Medicine==
* Harvey Cushing identifies Cushing&#x27;s disease, caused by a malfunction of the pituitary gland.
* Solomon Carter Fuller first names Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.
* Hakaru Hashimoto first describes the symptoms of Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis.

==Metallurgy==
* Krupp engineers Benno Strauss and Eduard Maurer patent austenitic stainless steel (October 17) and Elwood Haynes (in the United States) and Harry Brearley (of Brown-Firth in Sheffield, England) independently discover martensitic stainless steel alloys.

==Meteorology==
* April 5 – Milutin Milanković&#x27;s &quot;Contribution to the mathematical theory of climate&quot;, his first work in this field, is published in Belgrade.

==Paleontology==

* November 11 – Lawrence Bragg presents his derivation of Bragg&#x27;s law for the angles for coherent and incoherent scattering from a crystal lattice.
* Max von Laue suggests using crystal lattices to diffract X-rays.
* Walter Friedrich and Paul Knipping diffract X-rays in zinc blende.
* Victor Hess discovers that the ionization of air increases with altitude, indicating the existence of cosmic radiation.

==Psychology==

<text>Charles Humphrey Keating Jr. (December 4, 1923 – March 31, 2014) was an American sportsman, lawyer, real estate developer, banker, financier, conservative activist, and convicted felon best known for his role in the savings and loan scandal of the late 1980s.

Keating was a champion swimmer for the University of Cincinnati in the 1940s. From the late 1950s through the 1970s, he was a noted anti-pornography activist, founding the organization Citizens for Decent Literature and serving as a member on the 1969 President&#x27;s Commission on Obscenity and Pornography.

In the 1980s, Keating ran American Continental Corporation and the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, and took advantage of loosened restrictions on banking investments. His enterprises began to suffer financial problems and were investigated by federal regulators. His financial contributions to, and requests for regulatory intervention from, five sitting U.S. senators led to those legislators being dubbed the &quot;Keating Five&quot;.

When Lincoln failed in 1989 it cost the federal government over $3 billion and about 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds. In the early 1990s, Keating was convicted in both federal and state courts of many counts of fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. He served four and a half years in prison before those convictions were overturned in 1996. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to a more limited set of wire fraud and bankruptcy fraud counts, and was sentenced to the time he had already served. Keating spent his final years in low-profile real estate activities until his death in 2014.

==Early life and military service==
Keating was born on December 4, 1923, in Cincinnati, Ohio, into a devout Roman Catholic family. He was the son of Adele (née Kipp) and Charles Humphrey Keating. He grew up in the Avondale and Clifton neighborhoods of that city.

His younger brother William was born in 1927. Their father came from Kentucky and managed a dairy. Charles Keating Sr. lost a leg in a hunting accident, and then fell into a long decline from Parkinson&#x27;s disease around 1931, and was nursed by his wife until his death in 1964.

Keating began swimming at a Catholic summer camp and became passionately involved in the sport. He attended St. Xavier High School, where he was a good student, was on the swimming team all four years, and also ran track and played football.

In swimming he led the team to three Greater Catholic League championships, set several school records, was named all-state, and was captain of the team in his senior year. Keating graduated from St Xavier in 1941.

After one semester at the University of Cincinnati in fall 1941, Keating left because of poor grades, although he advanced to the NCAA Men&#x27;s Swimming and Diving Championships in 1942, finishing sixth in the 200 yard breaststroke. He enlisted in the United States Navy. He trained in the Navy Air Corps to become a carrier-based pilot flying Grumman F6F Hellcats.

During World War II, Keating was stationed in the U.S., sometimes at Banana Creek in Florida, and flew Hellcats to armed services swimming meets. He was not injured at Naval Air Station Vero Beach when he failed to lower the landing gear on his Hellcat wrecking his plane in a belly landing. Due to squadron transfers and receiving additional training on new intercept methods, the war ended without his being engaged in combat.

==Education and swimming==
Keating was ready to return to college after finishing his Navy service in 1945. His abilities as a swimmer made him an attractive recruit, despite his having dropped out earlier. He cut a deal with the University of Cincinnati wherein it would accept for academic credit much of his Navy service, then he would take six months of liberal arts courses before entering its law school.

Keating won the 200-yard breaststroke at the Ohio Intercollegiate Conference championship in 1945. On March 30, 1946, Keating competed in the 200-yard breaststroke at the NCAA Men&#x27;s Swimming and Diving Championships at Yale University&#x27;s Payne Whitney Gymnasium. In an exciting, back-and-forth contest with Paul Murray of Cornell University and future coaching legend James Counsilman of Ohio State University, he prevailed by a foot to win the championship with a time of 2:26.2. (The event was later reclassified as the butterfly in NCAA records due to a definitional evolution involving the two strokes.)

This was the first ever national championship in any sport for the University of Cincinnati. He and teammate Roy Lagaly become the first-ever Bearcats to be named All-Americans. Keating was an imposing 6 feet 5 inches, a natural leader and co-captain of the team with Lagaly. Of Keating, Lagaly said, &quot;You could tell even then he was going to be very successful. He was very ambitious. Whatever he did, he did all the way.&quot; Keating followed this by swimming for Cincinnati Gym, finishing second to future Olympic gold medalist Joseph Verdeur in the 220-yard breaststroke at the April 1946 national AAU championships.

Keating received his law degree from the University of Cincinnati College of Law in 1948, and would later be named a member of the university&#x27;s Athletic Hall of Fame.

Charles Keating was a long-time supporter of U.S. swimming and beginning in 1969 he and his brother William donated $600,000 to St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati to build a state-of-the-art competition pool. The school&#x27;s swimming team went on to win many state titles. St. Xavier named the Keating Natatorium after the brothers&#x27; father, and inducted Charles Keating into its initial Athletic Hall of Fame class in 1985. The University of Cincinnati&#x27;s 2006 athletic building is named the Keating Aquatic Center, in honor of William Keating, and donations from the Keating family used to construct it. Charles Keating funded Cincinnati&#x27;s Marlins swim club; six swimmers on the 1980 Summer Olympics squad were from its roster, including future Olympic champion Mary T. Meagher. When he later moved to Phoenix, Charles Keating built the Phoenix Swim Club, where Olympians also trained.

==Marriage and family==
Keating married Mary Elaine Fette in 1949. She was an athletically minded Catholic from an established Cincinnati family. They had six children: daughters Kathleen, Mary, Maureen, Elaine, and Elizabeth, and a son, Charles Keating III.

His daughter Mary married Gary Hall, who would go on to swim in the 1968, 1972, and 1976 Summer Olympics, winning a medal in each one. Charles Keating III swam in the 1976 Summer Olympics, finishing fifth in the 200-meter breaststroke. Keating&#x27;s grandson Gary Hall Jr. competed in the 1996, 2000, and 2004 Summer Olympics as a swimmer and won ten medals overall.

Another Keating grandson, Chief petty officer Charles Keating IV, a Navy SEAL, was killed at age 31 in combat with ISIS in Iraq in 2016. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his actions in combat.

==Early legal and business career==
After law school graduation, Keating did spot legal work for the FBI, then joined a law firm doing corporate law. On the side, he entered the business world where his ventures involved selling life insurance, running a fruit stand, and working for Roto-Rooter.

In 1952, along with his brother, William, and a mutual friend from law school, he became a founding partner of the Cincinnati law firm Keating, Muething &amp; Klekamp. Beginning in the late 1950s they took on Carl Lindner Jr. as a client. Lindner was rapidly accumulating ice cream stores, supermarkets, real estate, and savings and loans, and soon essentially became Keating&#x27;s sole client. In 1956, he filed requests for Q clearances on behalf of a small company of former Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory scientists with an office in Newtown, Ohio; unknown to Keating, the FBI suspected the application was fraudulent and launched an investigation of him, but no charges were made. Keating was admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court bar in 1958.

In 1960, Lindner and Keating created American Financial Corporation, a holding company of Lindner&#x27;s disparate businesses that created further subsidiaries and financial instruments, all doing business with each other. Keating was named to the board of directors of the company in 1963.

==Anti-pornography activism==
In 1956, Keating joined a priest leading a group of Catholics in Cincinnati who were concerned about the dangers of pornography, and he began giving talks on the subject to parents and other groups. In 1958, Keating testified before the House Judiciary Committee on mail-order pornography, saying that it was &quot;capable of poisoning any mind at any age and of perverting our entire younger generation&quot;, and that it was closely tied to juvenile delinquency, while also quoting a Senate Committee report that &quot;part of the Communist conspiracy was to print (obscene materials)&quot;. Keating mentioned links between pornography and Communism at other times, but distanced himself from the more fervent anti-Communist groups of the early 1960s. He stated that 90 percent of obscene materials were produced for profit, not ideological reasons, and told Congress in 1960, &quot;I had better say [...] that I am not blaming obscenity in America on the Communists.&quot;

Keating founded Citizens for Decent Literature (CDL) in 1958 (later renamed a number of times, the best known of which is Citizens for Decency through Law), which advocated reading classics not &quot;smut.&quot; It would grow to 300 chapters and 100,000 members nationwide and become the largest anti-pornography organization in the nation. It absorbed some other groups, such as National Citizens for Decent Literature and the Pittsburgh National Better Magazines Council. The structure of CDL was initially decentralized, but Keating grew frustrated with some local chapters taking aggressive actions he did not approve of, and so he gave it a more controlled focus with a national magazine, film production, and a greater role in legal actions.

Over the next two decades, CDL mailed some 40 million letters on behalf of its position and filed a series of &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court. Keating gained the nickname &quot;Mr. Clean&quot;.

In 1964–65, Keating produced &quot;Perversion for Profit&quot;, a film featuring announcer George Putnam. It was a survey of then-available prurient and obscene materials, and asserted that pornography led to moral decay. It, along with two lesser-known films produced or distributed by CDL, was screened frequently throughout the country and remained in print for a long time.

In 1969, Keating&#x27;s national reputation on the issue led President Nixon to appoint him to the President&#x27;s Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, which had been begun under Nixon&#x27;s predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson. The majority on the commission issued a report which concluded that pornography does not degrade the morals of adults or cause crime and recommended that all federal, state, and local laws preventing consenting adults from obtaining pornographic materials be repealed. Keating, Nixon&#x27;s only appointee on the 18-person commission, was the leading commission dissenter from the report.

In September 1970, Keating was granted a temporary restraining order from the D.C. Federal District Court to delay publication of the report, stating that he needed access to all the report&#x27;s backing materials and time to write a dissent. Several days later, Keating was given the desired materials and two weeks to write his report by the committee.

Keating filed his dissent, saying, &quot;At a time when the spread of pornography has reached epidemic proportions in our country and when the moral fiber of our nation seems to be rapidly unravelling, the desperate need is for enlightenment and intelligent control of the poisons which threaten us – not the declaration of moral bankruptcy inherent in the repeal of the laws which have been the defense of decent people against the pornographer for profit.&quot; Keating wrote, &quot;One can consult all the experts he chooses, can write reports, make studies, etc., but the fact that obscenity corrupts lies within the common sense, the reason, and the logic of every man.&quot;

The Nixon administration tacitly supported Keating&#x27;s legal efforts, and counsellor to the President John Ehrlichman assigned White House speechwriter Pat Buchanan to help draft the dissenting report. The commission&#x27;s majority report was denounced by congressional leaders of both parties as well as by the administration.

The commission involvement earned Keating further national attention, which he used to push towards stringent behavior in Cincinnati. In 1969, Keating obtained an injunction preventing the showing in Cincinnati of softcore sexploitation master Russ Meyer&#x27;s film &quot;Vixen!&quot;, claiming it was obscene, and the film was seized by the police the first day it opened. Showing of the film was successfully stopped in other parts of Ohio as well, and Meyer spent $250,000 in defense against Keating&#x27;s legal actions. Keating said Meyer had done more to undermine morals in the nation than anyone else; Meyer responded that &quot;I was glad to do it.&quot; The Cincinnati &quot;Vixen!&quot; case was appealed and in 1971 the Supreme Court of Ohio upheld the prohibition.

In 1970, Keating tried to block a closed-circuit showing of the musical &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot; in Cincinnati, saying that &quot;it appeals to a prurient interest in sex.&quot; During 1972, a Keating legal action kept a sex film theater shut as a &quot;public nuisance&quot;. He tried to prevent newsstands near his office from selling &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Oui&quot; magazines. He denounced the Ramada Inn chain for offering adult programming on cable television to guests. Other local actions involving shutting stores and removing books from public libraries were attributed by civil liberties advocates to the &quot;oppressive&quot; trend that Keating had set. Such was Keating and his organization&#x27;s effectiveness that when the U.S. Supreme Court handed down the 1973 &quot;Miller v. California&quot; decision establishing that obscenity definitions be based upon local community standards, every adult bookstore and movie house in Cincinnati was closed within hours.

Citizens for Decent Literature and Keating often warned about homosexuality as an example of what they saw as perverse behavior. The film &quot;Perversion for Profit&quot; had included a claim that homosexuals had a slogan saying that &quot;today&#x27;s conquest is tomorrow&#x27;s competition&quot;; in a 1977 speech in Miami, Keating repeated this phrase, concluding from it that homosexuality represented an endless &quot;seduction of the innocent&quot;.

In 1975, &quot;Oui&quot; magazine gave Keating the top spot on its &quot;Enemies of pornography&quot; list. Hamilton County prosecutor Simon L. Leis Jr. put Ohio pornographer Larry Flynt on trial in 1976 for pandering obscenity and for engaging in a form of organized crime. Local public opinion ran against Flynt. Flynt was convicted on both counts and received the maximum sentence of 7 to 25 years in prison. While the conviction was later overturned on appeal, the verdict again established Cincinnati&#x27;s community standards in this regard, and even after Keating left for Arizona, his influence remained in Cincinnati being a center of anti-pornography fervor. In the 1996 biopic, &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, which reportedly exaggerated Keating&#x27;s role in the prosecution and trial, Keating was portrayed by actor James Cromwell. Attempts to show &quot;Vixen!&quot; in Cincinnati would continue, but by the late 1990s it was still illegal to do so. However, when in 1990, the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center and its director Dennis Barrie were prosecuted for obscenity for exhibiting Robert Mapplethorpe&#x27;s traveling solo show &quot;The Perfect Moment,&quot; they were found not guilty by a jury.

==American Financial Corporation==
While officially an outside lawyer, Keating functioned as a public face for Carl Lindner and American Financial Corporation and the two were close associates on business as well as legal matters; Lindner would sometimes refer to Keating as a &quot;founder&quot; of American Financial. The company had easy access to credit lines, which allowed it to continually grow. The web of transactions involving the company and its subsidiaries was large and complex, and one stock analyst stated in 1977 that he had &quot;never come across a company that has so much strange paper on its books.&quot;

Keating left his law practice in 1972 and formally joined American Financial Corporation, by now a $1 billion enterprise, as executive vice president. Keating became Lindner&#x27;s person in charge of firing employees from newly acquired companies. Within business circles Keating gained a reputation for aggressiveness and arrogance. He took on an operational involvement in &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, the town&#x27;s only morning newspaper. He interfered in editorial decisions, such as adding coverage to high school sports that he or Lindner&#x27;s sons were involved in. The paper was then sold to a group including his brother, William, who had been a Republican congressman from Ohio&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the early 1970s. Charles Keating was involved in American Financial&#x27;s 1974 sale of Bantam Books, and its decision that year not to enter the investment banking field.

In 1975 and 1976, several stockholder lawsuits were filed against American Financial, and Keating was under fire for aspects involving unsecured loans, stock warrants, and the sale of the &quot;Enquirer&quot;. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a major investigation of the company and charged Lindner, Keating and others with having defrauded investors and filing false SEC reports. At particular issue was a $14 million loan that the SEC said was made on preferential terms. Keating resigned from American Financial in August 1976, with conflicting stories as to whether or not Keating and Lindner had remained close or whether they had fallen out.

==American Continental Corporation==
Keating moved to Phoenix, Arizona in 1976 to run the real estate firm American Continental Homes, a struggling, millions-losing homebuilding spin-off of American Financial that was given over to Keating for $300,000 as part of his departure package. The move was completed when his family followed him in 1978. In 1979 the SEC case with American Financial was settled, with Keating signing a consent agreement where he neither admitted nor denied guilt but agreed not to violate federal fraud and securities statutes. In practice, Keating was blamed for much of the irregular financial practices that had gone on and his reputation was significantly damaged.

Keating reaped benefits from the move to Arizona, a wide-open territory in both a physical and business sense that allowed someone a fresh start. He turned the now-renamed American Continental Corporation around, adding various operations and divisions in a structure somewhat reminiscent of American Financial. As chairman and controlling stockholder, Keating relied heavily upon family members, employing his son and four of his sons-in-law in prominent positions. Charles Keating III had a fast career rise within the company.

In 1979, Keating served as head of fundraising in the Southwest for John Connally&#x27;s campaign for the 1980 Republican Party presidential nomination. Connally was a favorite of the business community, but his campaign had difficulty parlaying its fundraising successes into popular support. In early December 1979, Keating was named campaign manager, with the existing manager being demoted to campaign strategist. Keating&#x27;s first action was as a &quot;pruner&quot; who immediately fired twenty workers at the campaign&#x27;s Virginia headquarters. The campaign continued to struggle, and, by late February 1980, Keating was out as manager, with Connally taking the role. Connally&#x27;s campaign ended two weeks later, famously known for having spent $11 million and gaining only one delegate.

Having won the 1980 election, President Reagan contacted Keating about becoming U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas, where Keating had spent considerable time. When Keating&#x27;s run-in with the SEC resurfaced in press reports, however, he was dropped from consideration. This dismayed Keating, who subsequently said, &quot;To keep people like me out of positions like that because of yellow journalism, I don&#x27;t know what good it does.&quot;

By the early 1980s, American Continental&#x27;s profits were in the millions and it had become the biggest single-family home builder in Phoenix and Denver. At its peak it would have $6 billion in assets, a large number of subsidiaries, 2,500 employees, and a headquarters complex on Phoenix&#x27;s Camelback Road. It had three corporate jets and a helicopter. He was a very hard worker and a strong presence to his employees; one later said, &quot;It&#x27;s almost magnetic. When he moves, things happen. The office would come alive when he walked in.&quot; He inspired both camaraderie and fervent loyalty in them. While he demanded long hours, he often rewarded employees monetarily and with gifts. Businesspeople outside his company often found Keating arrogant and difficult to deal with. Congressman William Keating, who was well-liked, said of his brother: &quot;Charlie is impatient, aggressive, always on the move. He has clearly defined goals. I don&#x27;t think he worries about the popularity of his positions.&quot; A &quot;Fortune&quot; profile in 1977 reported, &quot;It seems almost impossible to find anyone who actually likes Charlie Keating.&quot; The story rankled Keating, who later had over five thousand large yellow &quot;I Like Charlie Keating&quot; buttons made up which he handed out to employees and visitors. Keating said, &quot;There are a lot of people that would say nasty things, I&#x27;m sure, about me, but it ain&#x27;t true that nobody ever liked Charlie Keating.&quot;

A devout Catholic, Keating became a heavy donor to charity when he moved to Phoenix, donating $100,000 to the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, more than $1 million to Covenant House, and another more than $1 million to Mother Teresa&#x27;s operations, including lending her his helicopter when she was in Arizona so that she could visit remote Indian reservations in the state. Covenant House&#x27;s Father Bruce Ritter said of Keating, &quot;He makes you believe in Providence.&quot; In 1983, Keating and his companies made legal but unusually large campaign donations in races for the Phoenix City Council, who were responsible for approving his building projects including water usage for residential developments built around artificial ponds. The scale of donations represented a change from past practice in local Phoenix politics; some council figures opposed the trend, while others readily asked for the funds.

==Lincoln Savings and the Keating Five==
In 1984, American Continental Corporation bought Lincoln Savings and Loan Association for just over $50 million. Up through the early 1980s, Lincoln had been a conservatively-run enterprise, with almost half its assets in home loans and only a quarter of its assets considered at risk. It made slow growth at best, and had shown a loss for several years until it made a profit of a few million dollars in 1983. Once he took over, Keating fired the existing management. Savings and loan associations had been deregulated in the early 1980s, allowing them to make high-risk investments with their depositors&#x27; money, a change of which Keating and other savings and loan operators took advantage. When Keating later was asked why he got into savings and loans, he said, &quot;I know the business inside out, and I always felt that an S &amp; L, if they&#x27;d relax the rules, was the biggest moneymaker in the world.&quot;

Over the next four years Lincoln&#x27;s assets increased from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion. Lincoln&#x27;s particular investments took the form of buying land, taking equity positions in real estate development projects, and buying high-yield junk bonds. A sales document from this period urges staff to, &quot;always remember the weak, meek and ignorant are always good targets.&quot;

Beginning in 1985 the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) feared that the savings industry&#x27;s risky investment practices were exposing the government&#x27;s insurance funds to huge losses. It instituted a rule whereby savings associations could hold no more than 10 percent of their assets in &quot;direct investments&quot;, and were thus prohibited from taking ownership positions in certain financial entities and instruments. Lincoln had become burdened with bad debt resulting from its past aggressiveness, and by early 1986 its investment practices were being investigated and audited by the San Francisco office of the FHLBB: in particular whether it had violated these direct investment rules; Lincoln had directed accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation into commercial real estate ventures. By the end of 1986, that office of the FHLBB had found that Lincoln had $135 million in unreported losses and had surpassed the regulated direct investments limit by $600 million.

Keating believed that the regulators were against him because he opposed their rules. He also told his staff that some of the San Francisco regulators were likely &quot;homos&quot; who were &quot;out to get him&quot; for his strong moral views. Keating took measures to oppose the FHLBB, including recruiting a study from then-private economist Alan Greenspan saying that direct investments were not harmful, trying to hire FHLBB members or their wives, and getting President Ronald Reagan to make a recess appointment of a Keating ally, real estate developer Lee H. Henkel Jr., to the FHLBB. By March 1987, however, the ally had resigned upon news of his having large loans due to Lincoln. It appeared as though the government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent.

Starting in January 1987, Keating looked for help from what would become known as &quot;the Keating Five&quot;: Democratic U.S. Senators Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio, and Donald W. Riegle of Michigan, and Republican U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona. Keating had, or would soon make, legal political contributions of about $1.3 million to the senators, and he called on them to help him resist the regulators. Keating became a personal friend of McCain following their initial contacts in 1981, and McCain was the only one of the five with close social and personal ties to Keating. McCain and his family had made several trips at Keating&#x27;s expense, sometimes aboard American Continental&#x27;s jet, for vacations at Keating&#x27;s opulent Bahamas retreat at Cat Cay.

Keating asked that Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, so it could limit its high risk investments and get into the relatively safe home mortgage business, allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young &amp; Co. bolstered Keating&#x27;s case that the government investigation was taking a long time. McCain initially refused to meet with Keating over the FHLBB matter and Keating called McCain a &quot;wimp&quot; behind his back. The two had a heated, contentious meeting in which McCain said he had not spent years in North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camps to have his courage or integrity questioned; the friendship ended and they would not speak again. In April 1987, the group of senators met twice with FHLBB members who were investigating American Continental Corporation and Lincoln, in an attempt to end the investigation. Meanwhile, Keating filed a lawsuit against the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The outgoing head of the FHLBB in Washington deferred judgment and the new head was more sympathetic to Keating. In May 1988, the FHLBB agreed to an unprecedented memorandum of understanding giving Lincoln a clean slate and forgiveness for any violations up to that point. (In 1991, the senators would be rebuked to various degrees by the Senate Ethics Committee, with Cranston receiving the harshest verdict and Glenn and McCain the least. McCain later testified against Keating in a civil lawsuit brought by Lincoln bondholders, while the other four refused to testify.)

==Failure of Lincoln and American Continental==

Lincoln stayed in business; from mid-1987 to April 1989, its assets grew from $3.91 billion to $5.46 billion. Following Keating&#x27;s past practices with Lindner, American Continental amassed a large collection of confusingly connected subsidiaries in real estate, banking, and insurance businesses; these numbered at least 54, and there were some overseas ones that auditors were not aware of. Keating was triumphant in having defeated the regulators, whom he despised as useless relics from an outmoded financial past, and defended his high salary and business practices. He spent about $500,000 on radio advertisements in the Phoenix area to improve his public image; the commercials stressed his real estate projects and his family-oriented values. A 1988 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; profile assessed Keating as &quot;a businessman without apparent peer in Arizona in terms of riches, clout and color.&quot; While Keating had taken Citizens for Decency through Law with him, he had generally de-emphasized his anti-pornography work when he moved to Arizona. Nevertheless, X-rated movies and &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine were banned from his hotels.

In October 1988, Keating opened his most extravagant real estate project ever, the , 600-room The Phoenician Resort at the base of Camelback Mountain. Its construction cost $300 million, included many opulent, imported features, and saw a number of instances of Keating or his decorator wife making wholesale late design changes at great expense. His other grand project was Estrella, a mixed-use development outside of Phoenix in Goodyear, Arizona, in the direction of the Sierra Estrella. Incorporating homes, offices, industrial buildings, schools, shopping, a resort and a hospital, it was intended to eventually house 200,000 people and become a model 21st-century city. American Continental wrote rules saying that Estrella homeowners could not &quot;intentionally terminat[e] a human pregnancy&quot; or possess &quot;adult material&quot;, but removed them once Keating was informed that such covenants were unconstitutional. A late 1980s downturn in the Sun Belt real estate market put Estrella in jeopardy before much building could be done.

Asked in an interview if he ever worried about going broke, Keating responded, &quot;All the time, every day. I come into the office with this hollow feeling in my stomach lots of time... You get trapped almost. You get too many responsibilities. It&#x27;s a bellyfull to carry. It&#x27;s risky. Dangerous. There&#x27;s the possibility of failure with it every day and every night. But in a way, it&#x27;s a challenge. It&#x27;s invigorating. There isn&#x27;t any point in not being a player – you&#x27;re here... It&#x27;s not only the money. It&#x27;s the disgrace, yourself, your manhood. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d have a big problem with that. On the other hand I&#x27;m not sure I wouldn&#x27;t.&quot;

As Lincoln grew, money was siphoned from Lincoln to the parent American Continental Corporation under a variety of schemes, and American Continental spent lavishly on speculative investments and personal expenses. A new regulatory investigation began in July 1988. After Arthur Young &amp; Co indicated doubts about some accounting practices, Keating fired them in September 1988 and switched to Touche Ross. American Continental was desperate for cash inflow to make up for losses in real estate purchases and projects. Lincoln&#x27;s branch managers and tellers convinced customers to replace their federally insured certificates of deposit with higher-yielding bond certificates of American Continental; the customers later said they were never properly informed that the bonds were uninsured and very risky given the state of American Continental&#x27;s finances. The regulators had already adjudged the bonds to have no solvent backing. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation chair L. William Seidman would later write that Lincoln&#x27;s push to get depositors to switch was &quot;one of the most heartless and cruel frauds in modern memory&quot;. In late 1988, Keating began desperate attempts to sell Lincoln; regulators rejected one $50 million potential sale due to the buyers not meeting federal requirements.

A December 1988 audit by the FHLBB found Lincoln in violation of many regulations and in danger of default. The following month they ordered Keating to stop transferring cash from Lincoln to American Continental, which imperiled the latter&#x27;s survival strategy and caused its stock price to nosedive. Keating tried to arrange junk bond deals with Michael Milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash, but the moves failed and he lost $11 million in one month alone. Keating got Senators DeConcini and Cranston to pressure the regulators to let a sale go through, but this time the lawmakers were ignored.

American Continental went bankrupt in April 1989, and Lincoln was seized by the FHLBB. About 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds. Many investors, often ones living in California retirement communities, lost their life savings, and later claimed to have suffered emotional trauma for having been duped on top of their financial devastation. The total bondholder loss came to between $250 million and $288 million.

The federal government was eventually liable for $3.4 billion to cover Lincoln&#x27;s losses when it seized the institution. In talking to reporters in April 1989, Keating maintained that he was the victim of a federal government that had spent years trying to destroy him, and then said, &quot;One question, among many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause. I want to say in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so.&quot;

In September 1989, Keating was hit with a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering action, filed against him by the regulators. He proclaimed that, &quot;We&#x27;ve lost everything in this thing, my wife and I. It&#x27;s devastating.&quot; In November 1989, Keating was subpoenaed to testify before the House Banking Committee, but refused to answer questions, invoking his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. Also in November, his Phoenician Resort was seized by the FBI; under their operation it became known as &quot;Club Fed&quot; before later being sold to a Kuwaiti group. The vastly ambitious Estrella project would remain deserted and was sold in 1993 to an investment group.

By November 1989, the estimated cost of the overall savings and loan crisis had reached $500 billion, and the media&#x27;s coverage often highlighted Keating&#x27;s role as part of what became a feeding frenzy. Keating and Lincoln Savings became convenient symbols for arguments about what had gone wrong in America&#x27;s financial system and society, as well as for 1980s greed in general, and were featured in popular culture references. A deck of playing cards would be marketed, called &quot;The Savings and Loan Scandal&quot;, that featured on their face Charles Keating holding up his hand, with images of the Keating Five senators portrayed as puppets on his fingers.

==Legal consequences==
Keating blamed government regulators for the failure of Lincoln Savings and sued for control over the bank. The suit was dismissed in August 1990, with the judge calling the seizure fully justified. Keating&#x27;s legal fees were running at $1 million per month.

In September 1990, Keating and his associates were indicted by the State of California on 42 counts related to having duped Lincoln&#x27;s customers into buying worthless junk bonds of American Continental Corporation. Keating went to jail when he could not post a $5 million bond. He was convicted in December 1991 of 17 counts of fraud, racketeering, and conspiracy. Mother Teresa asked the court to show leniency to Keating, in recognition of the considerable sums he had donated to her charitable operations. In April 1992, California Superior Court Judge Lance Ito gave Keating the maximum 10-year prison sentence, quoting Woody Guthrie, to wit &quot;More people have suffered from the point of a fountain pen than from a gun.&quot; Keating was sent to the medium-security Federal Correctional Institution, Tucson to serve his time.

In May 1992, Keating&#x27;s son-in-law, Robert M. Wurzelbacher Jr., a senior vice president of American Continental, and chief executive of an investment firm owned by Lincoln Savings, who was also implicated, pleaded guilty to three federal fraud counts in connection with the collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association and agreed to testify against Keating. (In December 1993, Wurzelbacher was sentenced to a 40-month prison term.)

In January 1993, a federal conviction followed, on 73 counts of fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. In July 1993, Keating was given a 12 year sentence. The judge ordered Keating to pay restitution of $122 million to the government, but Keating said he was $10 million in debt and had no assets to sell.

One case filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was settled in 1994: Keating said he was bankrupt but agreed to repay millions should any hidden assets be discovered. A third case filed by the Resolution Trust Corporation resulted in a summary judgment of $4.3 billion against Keating and his wife in 1994, the largest judgment ever against a private person. The judgment was overturned on appeal in 1999, on grounds that Keating could not be held personally liable to the government without a specific criminal conviction or some other decision at trial. Throughout his incarceration, Keating maintained his innocence, saying he was a &quot;political prisoner&quot; of the U.S. government and a scapegoat for the largest banking scandal in the nation&#x27;s history.

In April 1996, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that state trial judge Ito had given the jury faulty instructions about the law regarding fraud. The conviction was overturned. In December 1996, the same Court of Appeals ruled that some of the jurors in the federal case might have been influenced by their knowledge and discussion of the results of the state case, and threw out the federal conviction. Keating was freed after 4 years in prison; he later said that staying tough during his incarceration was the thing he was proudest of. He was said to have gotten along well with other prisoners and served as best man at weddings for some that he met there.

In April 1999, on the eve of the retrial of the federal case, Keating entered a plea agreement. He admitted to having committed four counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud by extracting nearly $1 million from American Continental Corp while already anticipating the collapse that happened weeks later. The federal prosecutors dropped all other charges against him and his son, Charles Keating III. He was sentenced to time served.

In October 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the government&#x27;s appeal of the overturning of the state conviction. This left Keating without any convictions other than that from his plea bargain. State prosecutors declined to move for a retrial, saying it would bring no more than a six-month jail sentence and that many witnesses had died in the interim or were in bad health. Keating replied that if the government had left him alone, investors &quot;would all be rich.&quot;

==Final years and death==
Following his release from prison, Keating separated from his wife Mary. He moved in with his daughter Mary and son-in-law Gary Hall Sr. in the Phoenix suburb of Paradise Valley.
During the 2000s, Keating worked as a business consultant and as of 2008 was involved in some successful real estate developments in the Phoenix market. He kept a low profile in his business operations, and declined comment during John McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign when the Keating Five scandal was brought up again by the press. During his final years, Keating maintained good physical shape through swimming and walking and was able to go out in public without being recognized.

Charles Keating died in a Phoenix hospital on March 31, 2014, at age 90, after an undisclosed illness of several weeks.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s lengthy profile of Keating in 1990 said in summary:
To say that Charles Keating is a complex man seems a gross understatement. Some see him as an aggressive man who got desperate when the real estate market bottomed out and crossed the line between &quot;business as usual&quot; and fraud. Others see him as a con artist who finally got caught, a hypocrite who masked his greed with phony piety.

Michael Binstein and Charles Bowden&#x27;s 1993 book, &quot;Trust Me: Charles Keating and the Missing Billions&quot;, also presents Keating as a complex individual with contradictory tendencies, and concludes:Charlie Keating built things, and, at some level that haunts anyone who looks over his records, he thought his schemes would work. He did not simply rob a bank. He broke a bank with his dreams. If he is simply a thief, why did he put the money into deals and projects instead of into his own pocket? If he is just a hardworking businessman simply trying to make a profit and create jobs, why the need for jets, fancy meals, big paychecks to his family? If he is such a devout communicant of his faith, why did he peddle hundreds of millions of dollars&#x27; worth of junk bonds to old people when he knew his empire was in serious jeopardy?

Keating steadfastly maintained that it was not his mistakes or criminal deeds but regulators&#x27; actions that were responsible for the major losses.

Some of Keating&#x27;s 1980s judgment as a developer was later vindicated. The Phoenician became a successful hotel in the luxury segment, and the Estrella project achieved at least some of Keating&#x27;s vision and was acquired again in 2005.

== In popular culture ==
In the novel &quot;Myron&quot;, author Gore Vidal uses the names of various anti-pornography crusaders to take the place of swear words. One of the names is &quot;keating&quot;, which is used many times throughout the book as a synonym for &quot;shit&quot;.

Keating, portrayed by James Cromwell, appeared in Miloš Forman&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, leading a Citizens for Decent Literature charge against Flynt&#x27;s &quot;Hustler Magazine&quot;.

<doc id="350571" wikidata="Q1929736" url="?curid=350571" title="Early history of Cambodia">
<text>The early history of Cambodia follows the prehistoric and protohistoric development of Cambodia as a country in mainland Southeast Asia. Thanks to archaeological work carried out since 2009, this can now be traced back to the Neolithic period. As excavation sites have become more numerous and modern dating methods are applied, settlement traces of all stages of human civil development from neolithic hunter-gatherer groups to organized preliterate societies are documented in the region.

Historical records of a political structure on territory that is now modern-day Cambodia first appear in Chinese annals in reference to Funan, a polity that encompassed the southernmost part of the Indochinese peninsula during the 1st to 6th centuries. Centered at the lower Mekong, Funan is noted as the oldest regional Hindu culture, which suggests prolonged socio-economic interaction with maritime trading partners of the Indosphere in the west. By the 6th century a civilization, titled Chenla or Zhenla in Chinese annals, had firmly replaced Funan, as it controlled larger, more undulating areas of Indochina and maintained more than a singular center of power.

The Khmer Empire was established by the early 9th century in a mythical initiation and consecration ceremony to claim political legitimacy by founder Jayavarman II at Mount Kulen (Mount Mahendra) in 802 C.E. A succession of powerful sovereigns, continuing the Hindu devaraja cult tradition, reigned over the classical era of Khmer civilization until the 11th century. A new dynasty of provincial origin introduced Buddhism as changes of religious, dynastic, administrative and military nature, environmental problems and ecological imbalance coincide with shifts of power in Indochina. 

The royal chronology ends in the 14th century. Great achievements in administration, and accomplishments in agriculture, architecture, hydrology, logistics, urban planning and the arts are testimony to a creative and progressive civilization - in its complexity a cornerstone of Southeast Asian cultural legacy.

==Prehistoric Cambodia==
In 1963 E. Saurin and J-P Carbonnel identified what they believed to be stone tools dating from c.600,000 BP at Sre Sbov in Kratie province; in 2009 a re-examination of the site indicated that the artifacts are results of prehistoric fluvial movement and do not indicate early stone technology.

The earliest traces of human presence in Cambodia have been found at Laang Spean, a cave in Battambang province. Starting in 2009 archaeological research of the Franco-Cambodian Prehistoric Mission has documented an incomplete cultural sequence from c.70,000 BP to the Neolithic, with clear evidence of a Hoabinhian cultural presence. Equally significant is the site Samrong Sen in Kampong Chhnang Province which was occupied since around 1500 BC and the relative recent site of Phum Snay.

Recent archaeological finds (since 2012) indicate that parts of the region now called Cambodia were inhabited during the second and first millennia BC by a Neolithic hunter and gatherer culture that may have migrated from southeastern China to the Indochinese Peninsula, responsible for the construction of circular earthworks. The Iron Age period beginning around 500 BC, the inhabitants had developed complex, organised societies and a varied religious cosmology by the 1st century CE and engaging in maritime trade, resulting in socio-political interaction with the Indosphere. These original inhabitants spoke advanced Austroasiatic languages and participated in the exchange of contemporary technologies.

==Mythology==
The Khmer people&#x27;s founding legend centers around an Indian kurmi or prince named Preah Thong in Khmer, dhruv in Sanskrit and Hun-t’ien in Chinese records, who marries the local ruler&#x27;s daughter, a Naga princess named Nagi Soma (Lieu-Ye in Chinese records), thus establishing the first Cambodian royal dynasty. One day the princess saw the Kurmi on a boat and went to speak with him, but was shot by one of his magic arrows which made her fall in love with him. Her father drank all the water that inundated the land and gave the new land to them as a dowry. 

The Nāga are a pan-Asian mythical race of reptilian beings, who in Cambodia were believed to possess a large empire or kingdom in the Pacific Ocean region. Cambodians today still say that they are &quot;Born from the Naga&quot; See: Sage Kambu Swayambhuva.

==Funan==
At about the time that Western Europe was absorbing the classical culture and institutions of the Mediterranean, the people of mainland and insular Southeast Asia were responding to the stimulus of a civilization that had arisen in India during the previous millennium. The Indianization of Southeast Asia happened as a consequence of the increasing trade in the Indian Ocean. Vedic and Hindu religion, political thought, literature, mythology, and artistic motifs gradually became integral elements in local Southeast Asian cultures. The Indianization stimulated the rise of highly organised, centralised states.

Funan, the earliest of the Indianised states, is generally considered to have been the first kingdom in the area. Found in the 1st century CE, Funan was located on the lower reaches of the Mekong River delta area, in what is today southeast Cambodia and the extreme south of Vietnam. Its capital, Vyadhapura, probably was located near the present-day town of Ba Phnom in Prey Veng Province. The earliest historical reference to Funan is a Chinese description of a mission that visited the country in the 3rd century. The name Funan is largely believed to be derived from the Old Khmer word &#x27;Phnom&#x27; meaning mountain. The Funanese were likely of Austroasiatic origin. What the Funanese called themselves, however, is not known.

During this early period in Funan&#x27;s history, the population was probably concentrated in villages along the Mekong River and along the Tonlé Sap River below the Tonlé Sap. Traffic and communications were mostly waterborne on the rivers and their delta tributaries. The area was a natural region for the development of an economy based on fishing and rice cultivation. There is considerable evidence that the Funanese economy depended on rice surpluses produced by an extensive inland irrigation system. Maritime trade played an extremely important role in the development of Funan, and the remains of what is believed to have been the kingdom&#x27;s main port, Óc Eo (O&#x27;keo) (now part of Vietnam), contain Roman as well as Persian, Indian, and Greek artefacts.

By the 5th century, the state exercised control over the lower Mekong River area and the lands around the Tonle Sap. It also commanded tribute from smaller states in the area now comprising northern Cambodia, southern Laos, southern Thailand, and the northern portion of the Malay Peninsula. Indianization was fostered by increasing contact with the subcontinent through the travels of merchants, diplomats, and learned Brahmins. By the end of the 5th century, the elite culture was thoroughly Indianised. Court ceremony and the structure of political institutions were based on Indian models. The Sanskrit language was widely used; the laws of Manu, the Indian legal code, were adopted; and an alphabet based on Indian writing systems was introduced.

Beginning in the early 6th century, civil wars and dynastic strife undermined Funan&#x27;s stability. A former northern vassal turned to independent kingdom, Chenla, began to increase its power and status quo was achieved only through dynastic marriages. Eventually Funan was absorbed by the Khmer Chenla and became a vassal itself. Funan disappears from history in the 7th century.

==Chenla==

The people of Chenla were probably Khmer. Inscriptions prove that Khmer script, adopted from south Indian Pallava script, had fully developed and was in use alongside Sanskrit. Chenla is first mentioned in the Chinese Sui dynasty&#x27;s history as a Funan vassal. The founder of the kingdom, who managed to break free from Funan&#x27;s control, was Strutavarman. A later king, Bhavarman, invaded Funan annexing it to Chenla&#x27;s domains. Once they established control over Funan, they embarked on a course of conquest that continued for three centuries. They subjugated central and upper Laos, annexed portions of the Mekong Delta, and brought what are now western Cambodia and southern Thailand under their direct control.

At the same time, king Mahendravarman established peace with the neighbouring kingdom of Champa through marriage arrangements, and Isnavarman, who succeeded him in 616, moved to a new capital, which, according to a Chinese writer, was inhabited by 20 thousands families. Culturally, the royal families of Chenla generally preserved the earlier political, social, and religious institutions of Funan, thus preserving the elements introduced from India. Chenla appears to have had a preference for Hinduism over other religions brought from there, like Buddhism.

In the 8th century, however, factional disputes at the Chenla court resulted in the splitting of the kingdom into rival northern and southern halves. According to Chinese chronicles, the two parts were known as (or Upper Chenla) and (or Lower Chenla). Land Chenla maintained a relatively stable existence, but Water Chenla underwent a period of constant turbulence, partly because of attacks from the sea by the Javanese and others. The Sailendra dynasty in Java actively tried to establish control on Water Chenla territories and eventually forced the kingdom to vassal status. 

The last of the Water Chenla kings allegedly was killed around 790 by a Javanese monarch whom he had offended. The ultimate victor in the strife that followed was the ruler of a small Khmer state located north of the Mekong Delta. His assumption of the throne as Jayavarman II (ca. 802 - 850) marked the liberation of the Khmer people from Javanese suzerainty and the beginning of a Khmer empire.

==Khmer Empire==

The classic period or Khmer Empire lasted from the early 9th century to the early 15th century. Technical and artistic progress, greatest cultural achievements, political integrity and administrative stability marked the golden age of Khmer civilization. The ruins of great temple complexes surrounded by an elaborate hydraulic network - the capital cities of &quot;Angkor&quot;, located north of the Tonle Sap lake near the modern town of Siem Reap, are a lasting monument to the accomplishments of Jayavarman II and his successors.

Jayavarman II settled north of the Tonle Sap and founded Hariharalaya, at modern day Roluos. Indravarman I (877 - 889) extended Khmer control as far west as the Korat Plateau in Thailand, and he ordered the construction of a huge reservoir north of the capital to provide irrigation for wet rice cultivation. His son, Yasovarman I (889 - 900), built the Eastern Baray (reservoir or tank), evidence of which remains to the present time. Its dikes, which may be seen today, are more than 6 kilometres long and 1.6 kilometres wide.

The elaborate system of canals and reservoirs built under Indravarman I and his successors were the key to Kambuja&#x27;s prosperity for half a millennium. By freeing cultivators from dependence on unreliable seasonal monsoons, they made possible an early &quot;green revolution&quot; that provided the country with large surpluses of rice. The empire&#x27;s decline during the 13th and 14th centuries probably was hastened by the deterioration of the irrigation system. Attacks by Thai and other foreign peoples and the internal discord caused by dynastic rivalries diverted human resources from the system&#x27;s upkeep, and it gradually fell into disrepair.

Suryavarman II (1113 - 1150), one of the greatest Angkorian monarchs, expanded his kingdom&#x27;s territory in a series of successful wars against the kingdom of Champa in central Vietnam and the small Mon polities as far west as the Irrawaddy River of Burma. He reduced to vassalage the Thai peoples who had migrated into Southeast Asia from the Yunnan region of southern China and established his suzerainty over the northern part of the Malay Peninsula. His greatest achievement was the construction of the temple city complex of Angkor Wat. The largest religious edifice in the world, Angkor Wat is considered the greatest single architectural work in Southeast Asia. 

Territorial expansion came to a halt when Suryavarman II was killed in battle attempting to invade Đại Việt. With Đại Việt&#x27;s support, the Cham quickly drove Khmer presence out of Champa territory. Suryavarman II&#x27;s reign was then followed by thirty years of dynastic upheaval and an invasion in revenge by the neighbouring Cham, who destroyed the city of Angkor in 1177.

The Cham ultimately were driven out by Jayavarman VII, whose reign (1181 - ca. 1218) marked the apogee of Kambuja&#x27;s power. Unlike his predecessors, who had adopted the worship of the Hindu god-king, Jayavarman VII was a fervent patron of Mahayana Buddhism. Casting himself as a bodhisattva, he embarked on a frenzy of building activity that included the Angkor Thom complex and the Bayon, a remarkable temple whose stone towers depict 216 faces of buddhas, gods, and kings. 

He also built over 200 rest houses and hospitals throughout his kingdom. Like the Roman emperors, he maintained a system of roads between his capital and provincial towns. According to historian Georges Coedès, &quot;No other Cambodian king can claim to have moved so much stone.&quot; Often, quality suffered for the sake of size and rapid construction, as is revealed in the intriguing but poorly constructed Bayon.

Carvings show that everyday Angkorian buildings were wooden structures not much different from those found in Cambodia today. The impressive stone buildings were not used as residences by members of the royal family. Rather, they were the focus of Hindu or Buddhist beliefs that celebrated the divinity, or buddhahood, of the monarch and his family. Coedès suggests that they had the dual function of both temple and tomb. Typically, their dimensions reflected the structure of the Hindu mythological universe. 

For example, five towers at the centre of the Angkor Wat complex represent the peaks of Mount Meru, the centre of the universe; an outer wall represents the mountains that ring the world&#x27;s edge; and a moat depicts the cosmic ocean. Like many other ancient edifices, the monuments of the Angkorian region absorbed vast reserves of resources and human labour and their purpose remains shrouded in mystery.

Angkorian society was strictly hierarchical. The king, regarded as divine, owned both the land and his subjects. Immediately below the monarch and the royal family were the Brahman priesthood and a small class of officials, who numbered about 4,000 in the 10th century. Next were the commoners, who were burdened with heavy corvée (forced labour) duties. There was also a large slave class who built the enduring monuments.

After Jayavarman VII&#x27;s death, Kambuja entered a long period of decline that led to its eventual disintegration. The Thai were a growing menace on the empire&#x27;s western borders. The spread of Theravada Buddhism, which came to Kambuja from Sri Lanka by way of the Mon kingdoms, challenged the royal Hindu and Mahayana Buddhism. Preaching austerity and the salvation of the individual through his or own her efforts, Theravada Buddhism did not lend doctrinal support to a society ruled by an opulent royal establishment maintained through the virtual slavery of the masses.

In 1353 a Thai army captured Angkor. It was recaptured by the Khmer, but wars continued and the capital was looted several times. During the same period, Khmer territory north of the present Laotian border was lost to the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang. In 1431 the Thai captured Angkor Thom. Thereafter, the Angkorian region did not again encompass a royal capital, except for a brief period in the third quarter of the 16th century.

<text>JavaOne is an annual conference first organized in 1996 by Sun Microsystems to discuss Java technologies, primarily among Java developers. It was held in San Francisco, California, typically running from a Monday to Thursday in summer months (early on) or in early fall months (later). Technical sessions and Birds of a Feather (BOF) sessions on a variety of Java-related topics were held throughout the week.

The show was very popular; for the 1999 edition, there were 20,000 attendees at the Moscone Center.

For many years, the conference was hosted by Sun executive and Java evangelist John Gage.

In 1999, the conference played host to an event called the Hackathon, a challenge set by Gage. Attendees were to write a program in Java for the new Palm V using the infrared port to communicate with other Palm users and register the device on the Internet.

During the 2008 conference, seventy Moscone Center staff members and three attendees were sickened by an outbreak of norovirus.

After the acquisition of Sun by Oracle Corporation in 2010, the conference was held concurrently with Oracle OpenWorld. The conference was moved from Moscone Center to hotels on nearby Mason Street. In some years, one block of Mason was closed and covered with a tent, which formed part of the conference venue.

In April 2018, Oracle announced that the JavaOne conference would be discontinued, in favor of a more general programming conference called &quot;Oracle Code One&quot;. The CodeOne conference ran for two years.

In March 2022, Oracle announced that JavaOne will return in October 2022, reclaiming the position the now defunct CodeOne conference once occupied. The conference has moved to Las Vegas from its original location in San Francisco.

In March 2024, Oracle announced that JavaOne would be held in March, 2025, coinciding with Java&#x27;s 30th birthday, moving back to (near) its original location in San Francisco.
==Show device==
Several of the conferences highlighted a hardware device, typically made available to attendees before it is sold to the general public, or at a steep discount:
* 1998: Java ring
* 1999: Palm V
* 2002: Sharp Zaurus
* 2004: Homepod, a wireless MP3 device from Gloolabs
* 2006: SavaJe Jasper S20 phone
* 2007: RS Media programmable robot
* 2008: Sentilla Perk Kit, Pulse Smartpen, Sony Ericsson K850i
* 2009: HTC Diamond with JavaFX pre-installed

==CommunityOne==

From 2007 to 2009, an associated one-day event, CommunityOne, was held, for the broader free and open-source developer community.

In 2009, CommunityOne expanded to New York City (CommunityOne East, March 18–19) and to Oslo, Norway (CommunityOne North, April 15). The third annual CommunityOne in San Francisco took place from June 1–3, 2009, at Moscone Center.

Tracks included:

* Cloud Platforms – Development and deployment in the cloud
* Social and Collaborative Platforms – Social networks and Web 2.0 trends
* RIAs and Scripting – Rich Internet Applications, scripting and tools
* Web Platforms – Dynamic languages, databases, and Web servers
* Server-side Platforms – SOA, tools, application servers, and databases
* Mobile Development – Mobile platforms, devices, tools and application development
* Operating Systems and Infrastructure – Performance, virtualization, and native development
* Free and Open – Open-source projects, business models, and trends

CommunityOne was discontinued after the acquisition of Sun by Oracle.

<doc id="350575" wikidata="Q4919413" url="?curid=350575" title="Post-Angkor period">
<text>The post-Angkor period of Cambodia (), also called the Middle period, refers to the historical era from the early 15th century to 1863, the beginning of the French protectorate of Cambodia. As reliable sources (for the 15th and 16th centuries, in particular) are very rare, a defensible and conclusive explanation that relates to concrete events that manifest the decline of the Khmer Empire, recognised unanimously by the scientific community, has so far not been produced. However, most modern historians have approached a consensus in which several distinct and gradual changes of religious, dynastic, administrative and military nature, environmental problems and ecological imbalance coincided with shifts of power in Indochina and must all be taken into account to make an interpretation. In recent years scholars&#x27; focus has shifted increasingly towards human–environment interactions and the ecological consequences, including natural disasters, such as flooding and droughts.

Stone epigraphy in temples, which had been the primary source for Khmer history, is already a rarity throughout the 13th century, ends in the third decade of the fourteenth, and does not resume until the mid-16th century. Recording of the Royal Chronology discontinues with King Jayavarman IX Parameshwara (or Jayavarma-Paramesvara), who reigned from 1327 to 1336. There exists not a single contemporary record of even a king’s name for over 200 years. Construction and maintenance of monumental temple architecture had come to a standstill after Jayavarman VII&#x27;s reign. According to author Michael Vickery there only exist external sources for Cambodia’s 15th century, the Chinese &quot;Ming Shilu&quot; (&quot;Veritable Records&quot;) and the earliest Royal Chronicle of Ayutthaya, which must be interpreted with greatest caution. 

The single incident which undoubtedly reflects reality, the central reference point for the entire 15th century, is a Siamese intervention of some undisclosed nature at the capital Yasodharapura (Angkor Thom) around the year 1431. Historians relate the event to the shift of Cambodia&#x27;s political centre southward to the river port region of Phnom Penh and later Longvek.

Sources for the 16th century are more numerous, although still coming from outside of Cambodia. The kingdom&#x27;s new capital was Longvek, on the Mekong, which prospered as an integral part of the 16th century Asian maritime trade network, via which the first contact with European explorers and adventurers occurred. The rivalry with the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the west resulted in several conflicts, including the Siamese conquest of Longvek in 1594. The Vietnamese southward expansion reached Prei Nokor/Saigon at the Mekong Delta in the 17th century. This event initiates the slow process of Cambodia losing access to the seas and independent marine trade.

Siamese and Vietnamese dominance intensified during the 17th and 18th century, provoking frequent displacements of the seat of power as the Khmer monarch&#x27;s authority decreased to the state of a vassal. Both powers alternately demanded subservience and tribute from the Cambodian court. In the mid 19th century, with dynasties in Siam and Vietnam firmly established, Cambodia was placed under joint suzerainty between the two regional empires, thereby the Cambodian kingdom lost its national sovereignty. British agent John Crawfurd states: &quot;...the King of that ancient Kingdom is ready to throw himself under the protection of any European nation...&quot; To save Cambodia from being incorporated into Vietnam and Siam, King Ang Duong agreed to colonial France&#x27;s offers of protection, which took effect with King Norodom Prohmbarirak signing and officially recognising the French protectorate on 11 August 1863.

==Historical background and causes==
The Khmer Empire had steadily gained hegemonic power over most of mainland Southeast Asia since its early days in the 8th and 9th centuries. Rivalries and wars with its western neighbour, the Pagan Kingdom of the Mon people of modern-day Burma were less numerous and decisive than those with Champa to the east. The Khmer and Cham Hindu kingdoms remained for centuries preoccupied with each other&#x27;s containment and it has been argued that one of the Khmer&#x27;s military objectives was &quot;...in the reigns of the Angkor kings Suryavarman II and Jayavarman VII.&quot; the conquest of the Cham ports, &quot;...important in the international trade of the time&quot;. Even though the Khmer suffered a number of serious defeats, such as the Cham invasion of Angkor in 1177, the empire quickly recovered, capable to strike back, as it was the case in 1181 with the invasion of the Cham city-state of Vijaya.

Mongol incursions into southern China and political and cultural pressure caused the southward migration of the Tai people and Thai people and their settling on the upper Chao Phraya River in the 12th century. The Sukhothai Kingdom and later the Ayutthaya Kingdom were established and &quot;...conquered the Khmers of the upper and central Menam [Chao Phraya River] valley and greatly extended their territory...&quot;

===Military setbacks===
Although a number of sources, such as the Cambodian Royal Chronicles and the Royal chronicles of Ayutthaya contain recordings of military expeditions and raids with associated dates and the names of sovereigns and warlords, several influential scholars, such as David Chandler and Michael Vickery doubt the accuracy and reliability of these texts. Other authors, however, criticise this rigid &quot;overall assessment&quot;.

David Chandler states in &quot;A Global Encyclopedia of Historical Writing, Volume 2&quot;: &quot;Michael Vickery has argued that Cambodian chronicles, including this one, that treat events earlier than 1550 cannot be verified, and were often copied from Thai chronicles about Thailand...&quot;
Linguist Jean-Michel Filippi concludes: &quot;The chronology of Cambodian history itself is more a chrono-ideology with a pivotal role offered to Angkor.&quot; Similarities apply to Thai chronological records, with the notable example of the &quot;Ramkhamhaeng controversy&quot;.

According to the Siamese Royal chronicles of Paramanuchitchinorot, clashes occurred in 1350, around 1380, 1418 and 1431.

===Land or people debate===
Siamese sources record the habit of capturing sizeable numbers of inhabitants from the capital cities and centres of civilisation of the defeated parties in Chiang Mai and Angkor which can be assumed to have accelerated the cultural decline.

Author Michael Vickery debates the degree of importance of this subject in his publication &quot;Two Historical Records of the Kingdom of Vientiane - Land or People?&quot;: &quot;It is not at all certain that Angkor desired manpower in central Thailand, rather than simply control over the rich agricultural resources.&quot; and &quot;...whether the political economy of early Southeast Asia resulted in rulers being more concerned with control of land or control of people...&quot; and &quot;...both sides of this discussion have offered ad hoc, case-by-case pronunciamentos, which are then repeated like mantra... Critical discussion of the question is long overdue...&quot;

;Contrary views:

Author Akin Rabibhadana, who quotes Ram Khamhaeng: &quot;One particular characteristic of the historical Southeast Asian mainland states was the lack of manpower. The need for manpower is well illustrated by events following each war between Thailand and her neighbours. The victorious side always carried off a large number of people from the conquered territory. Whole villages were often moved into the territory of the conqueror, where they were assimilated and became the population of the conqueror.&quot;

David K. Wyatt: &quot;As much as anything else, the Tai müang was an instrument for the efficient use of manpower in a region where land was plentiful in relation to labor and agricultural technology.&quot;

Baker and Phongpaichit argues that, &quot;War in the region [Southeast Asia] was... an enterprise to acquire wealth, people, and scarce urban resources.&quot;

Bronson states, &quot;No farmers in any region outside southern and eastern Asia could produce as much food with as little labor from the same amount of land.&quot;

And Aung-Thwin wrote: &quot;Much of the warfare of early Southeast Asia witnessed the victor carrying off half the population of the vanquished foe and later resettling them on his own soil. Pagan was located in the dry belt of Burma, and depended mainly upon irrigated agriculture for its economic base. Land was plentiful but labor was extremely difficult to obtain.&quot;

===Dynastic and religious factors===

The complete transition from the early Khmer kingdom to the firm establishment of the Mahidharapura dynasty (first king Jayavarman VI, 1080 to 1107), which originated west of the Dângrêk Mountains at Phimai in the Mun river valley lasted several decades. Some historians argue, that these kings failed to acquire absolute central administrative control and had limited access to local resources. The dynasty discontinued &quot;ritual policy&quot; and genealogical traditions. Further momentum ensued as Mahayana Buddhism was eventually tolerated and several Buddhist kings emerged, including Suryavarman I, Rajendravarman II and Jayavarman VII. 

These rulers were not considered, and did not consider themselves, as divine, which lead to a shift in perception of royal authority, central power and a loss of dynastic prestige with respect to foreign rulers. Effectively the royal subjects were given permission to re-direct attention and support from the Hindu state of military dominance with its consecrated leader, the &quot;Varman&quot;—protector king, towards the inner-worldly alternative with the contradictory teachings of the Buddhist temple. Indravarman III (c. 1295-1308) adopted Theravada Buddhism as the state religion, which implied an even more passive, introverted focus towards individual and personal responsibility to accumulate merit to achieve nirvana.

Miriam T. Stark argues that competition and rivalries in royal succession, usurpers and &quot;second grade&quot; rulers characterised the kingdom since the 9th century. Periods of &quot;...consolidation alternated with political fragmentation [as] only few rulers were able to wrest control from the provincial level&quot;.

Debate remains on the progress of the imperial society as the kingdom grew and occupied foreign lands. Authors present numerous theories about the relationship between Southeast Asian kings and the populace&#x27;s loyalties, nature and degree of identity, the Mandala concept and the effects of changing state-religion. Scholar Ben Kiernan highlights a tendency to identify with a universal religion rather than to adhere to the concept of a people or nation, as he refers to author Victor Lieberman in: &quot;Blood and Soil: Modern Genocide 1500-2000&quot; &quot;[local courts make]...no formal demand, that rulers be of the same ethnicity as their subjects&quot;

===Environmental problems and infrastructural breakdown===
Historians increasingly maintain the idea that decline was caused by progressing ecological imbalance of the delicate irrigation network and canal system of &quot;...a profoundly ritualized, elaborate system of hydraulic engineering...&quot; at Angkor&#x27;s Yasodharapura. Recent studies indicate that the irrigation system was overworked and gradually started to silt up, amplified by large scale deforestation. Permanent monument construction projects and maintenance of temples instead of canals and dykes put an enormous strain on the royal resources and drained thousands of slaves and common people from the public workforce and caused tax deficits. 

Author Heng L. Thung addressed common sense in &quot;Geohydrology and the decline of Angkor&quot; as he sums things up: &quot;...the preoccupation of the Khmers with the need to store water for the long dry season. Each household needed a pond to provide drinking and household water for both man and beast. The barays [reservoirs] of Angkor were simply the manifestation of the need of an urban population. Water was the fountain of life for Angkor; a disruption in its supply would be fatal.&quot;

Recent Lidar (Light detection and ranging) Geo-Scans of Angkor have produced new data, that have caused several &quot;Eureka moments&quot; and &quot;have profoundly transformed our understanding of urbanism in the region of Angkor&quot;. Results of dendrochronological studies imply prolonged periods of drought between the 14th and 15th centuries. As a result, recent re-interpretations of the epoch put greater emphasis on human–environment interactions and the ecological consequences.

===Growth of international maritime trade===
Some historians have argued that an important reason for the Angkor court&#x27;s move to the lower Mekong Delta was due to the growth of international maritime trade with the rest of the world. Angkor, being primarily inland and largely agricultural, became increasingly irrelevant to the global markets in comparison to the later maritime Cambodian capitals at Longvek, Oudong, and later Phnom Penh.

==Chaktomuk era==
Following the abandonment of the capital Yasodharapura and the Angkorian sites, the Angkor elites established a new capital around two-hundred kilometres to the south-east on the site which is modern day Phnom Penh, at the confluence of the Mekong and the Tonle Sap river. Thus, it controlled the river commerce of the Khmer heartland, upper Siam and the Laotian kingdoms with access, by way of the Mekong Delta, to the international trade routes that linked the Chinese coast, the South China Sea, and the Indian Ocean. Unlike its inland predecessor, this society was more open to the outside world and relied mainly on commerce as the source of wealth. The adoption of maritime trade with China during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) provided lucrative opportunities for members of the Cambodian elite who controlled royal trading monopolies.

Historians consent that as the capital ceased to exist, the temples at Angkor remained as central for the nation as they always had been. 
David P. Chandler: &quot;The 1747 inscription is the last extensive one at Angkor Wat and reveals the importance of the temple in Cambodian religious life barely a century before it was &quot;discovered&quot; by the French.&quot;

==Longvek era==
King Ang Chan I (1516–1566) moved the capital from Phnom Penh north to Longvek at the banks of the Tonle Sap river. Trade was an essential feature and &quot;...even though they appeared to have a secondary role in the Asian commercial sphere in the 16th century, the Cambodian ports did indeed thrive.&quot; Products traded there included precious stones, metals, silk, cotton, incense, ivory, lacquer, livestock (including elephants), and rhinoceros horn.

===First contact with the West===
Messengers of Portuguese admiral Alfonso de Albuquerque, conqueror of Malacca arrived in Indochina in 1511, the earliest documented official contact with European sailors. By the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Longvek maintained flourishing communities of Chinese, Indonesians, Malays, Japanese, Arabs, Spaniards, English, Dutch and Portuguese traders.

Christian missionary activities began in 1555 with Portuguese clergyman friar Gaspar da Cruz, the first to set foot in the Kingdom of Cambodia, who &quot;...wasn’t able to spread the word of God and he was seriously ill[sic].&quot; Subsequent attempts did not yield any results that could substantiate a congregation.

===Military resurgence and fall===

Cambodia was a potent rival of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 16th century. Following the Burmese subjugation of Ayutthaya in 1569, Cambodia launched numerous military expeditions into a weakened Siam between the 1560s and the 1580s. In 1570, Cambodian forces besieged Ayutthaya, but were repulsed by fierce resistance and the rainy season floods. In 1581, Cambodia sacked the Siamese city of Phetchaburi and emptied the city of its inhabitants. 

Meanwhile, in 1572 and 1573-75, the king of Lan Xang sent two invasions to subjugate Longvek. Both invasions ended in complete failure and the Lan Xang king was assumed to have died in the conflict.

In retribution for multiple Longvek raids on Ayutthaya, in 1587, Cambodia was attacked by the Siamese Crown Prince Naresuan, who failed to besiege the city of Longvek. In 1594, Longvek was successfully captured and sacked by Siamese forces and Cambodian royals were taken hostage and relocated to the court of Ayutthaya.

The initially fortunate circumstances of some members of the Longvek royal family, managing to seek refuge at the Lao court of Vientiane, ended tragically. The refugees never returned to demand their claims. Their sons, born and raised in Lan Xang, were alienated and while &quot;moderately&quot; manipulated, engaged in local court politics with the exiled Cambodians in Ayutthaya and had the ruling vassal King Ram I, who was of lower birth, killed with the help of Spanish and Portuguese sailors.

Shortly after they were killed and defeated in the Cambodian–Spanish War, with foreign hands—Malays and Chams—involved. This pattern of royal indignity is noticeable in its continuity during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the Vietnamese court in Hue joining in as yet another stage of royal drama. Royal contender&#x27;s quarrels often prevented any chance of restoring an effective King of competitive authority for decades.

==Srey Santhor era==
Kings Preah Ram I and Preah Ram II moved the capital several times and established their royal capitals at Tuol Basan (Srey Santhor) around 40 kilometres north-east of Phnom Penh, later Pursat, Lavear Em and finally Oudong. In 1596 Spanish and Portuguese conquistadores from Manila raided and razed Srei Santhor.

==Lvea Aem era==
In 1618, King Chey Chettha II stopped sending tribute to Ayutthaya and reasserted Cambodian independence. A Siamese expedition in 1621-22 to reconquer Cambodia failed in dramatic fashion.

==Oudong era==

By the 17th and 18th centuries, Siam and Vietnam increasingly fought over control of the fertile Mekong basin, enhancing pressure on an unstable Cambodia. The 17th century was also the beginning of direct relations between post-Angkor Cambodia and Vietnam, that is the war between Nguyễn lords who ruled central and southern Vietnam and Trịnh lords in the north.

Henri Mouhot: &quot;Travels in the Central Parts of Indo-China&quot; 1864
However, Cambodia remained economically significant in the early part of the Oudong period. In the 17th century, the Japanese considered Cambodia to be a more important maritime power than Siam.

===Loss of the Mekong Delta===

By the late 15th century, the Vietnamese—descendants of the Sinic civilisation sphere—had conquered some of the territories of the principalities of Champa. Some of the surviving Chams began their diaspora in 1471, many re-settling in Khmer territory. However, the Cambodian Chronicle does not mention the Cham arrival in Cambodia until the 17th century. The last remaining principality of Champa, Panduranga, survived until 1832. 

====Traditional view====

In 1620 the Vietnamese on their southwards expansion (Nam tiến) had reached the Mekong Delta, a hitherto Khmer domain. Also in 1620 the Khmer king Chey Chettha II (1618–28) married a daughter of lord Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên, one of the Nguyễn lords, who held sway over southern Vietnam for most of the Lê dynasty era from 1428 to 1788. Three years later, king Chey Chettha allowed Vietnam to establish a custom-post at Prey Nokor, modern day Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam after gaining independence from the Chinese now instituted its own version of the frontier policies of the Chinese empire and by the end of the 17th century, the region was under full Vietnamese administrative control. Cambodia&#x27;s access to international sea trade was now hampered by Vietnamese taxes and permissions.

====Contrary views====

The story of a Cambodian king falling in love with a Vietnamese princess, who requested and obtained Kampuchea Krom, the Mekong Delta for Vietnam is folklore, dismissed by scholars and not even mentioned in the Royal Chronicles.

In the process of re-interpretation of the royal records and their rather doubtful contents, Michael Vickery again postulates that future publications take these contradicting facts into account: &quot;First, the very concept of a steady Vietnamese &quot;Push to the South&quot; (nam tiến) requires rethinking. It was not steady, and its stages show that there was no continuing policy of southward expansion. Each move was ad hoc, in response to particular challenges...&quot;

Vickery additionally argues that Cambodia was never &quot;cut off from maritime access to the outside world&quot; in the 17th century, as argued by David Chandler.

=== Mid 17th century–19th century ===
In 1642 Cambodian prince Ponhea Chan became king after overthrowing and assassinating king Outey. Malay Muslim merchants in Cambodia helped him in his takeover, and he subsequently converted to Islam from Buddhism, changed his name to Ibrahim, married a Malay woman and reigned as Ramathipadi I. His reign marked the historical apogee of Muslim rule in mainland Southeast Asia.
Ramathipadi defeated the Dutch East India Company in naval engagements of the Cambodian–Dutch War during 1643 and 1644. Pierre de Rogemortes, the ambassador of the Company was killed alongside a third of his 432 men and it was not until two centuries later that Europeans played any important and influential role in Cambodian affairs. In the 1670s the Dutch left all the trading posts they had maintained in Cambodia after the massacre in 1643. The first Vietnamese military intervention took place in 1658-59, in which rebel Cambodian princes, Ibrahim Ramathipadi&#x27;s own brothers, had requested military support to depose the Muslim ruler and restore Buddhism.

Siam, which might otherwise have been courted as an ally against Vietnamese incursions in the 18th century, was itself involved in prolonged conflicts with Burma and in 1767 the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya was completely destroyed. However, Siam recovered and soon reasserted its dominion over Cambodia. The youthful Khmer king Ang Eng (1779–96) was installed as monarch at Oudong while Siam annexed Cambodia&#x27;s Battambang and Siem Reap provinces. The local rulers became vassals under direct Siamese rule.

A renewed struggle between Siam and Vietnam for control of Cambodia and the Mekong basin in the early 19th century resulted in Vietnamese dominance over a Cambodian vassal king. Justin Corfield writes in &quot;French Indochina&quot;: &quot;[1807] the Vietnamese expanded their lands by establishing a protectorate over Cambodia. However king […] Ang Duong was keen on Cambodia becoming independent of [...] Thailand [...] and Vietnam [...] and sought help from the British in Singapore. When that failed, he enlisted the help of the French.&quot;

Attempts to force Cambodians to adopt Vietnamese customs caused several rebellions against Vietnamese rule. The most notable took place from 1840 to 1841, spreading through much of the country.

Siam and Vietnam had fundamentally different attitudes concerning their relationship with Cambodia. The Siamese shared a common religion, mythology, literature, and culture with the Khmer, having adopted many religious and cultural practices. The Thai Chakri kings followed the Chakravatin system of an ideal universal ruler, ethically and benevolently ruling over all his subjects.
The Vietnamese enacted a civilising mission, as they viewed the Khmer people as culturally inferior and regarded the Khmer lands as legitimate site for colonisation by settlers from Vietnam.

The territory of the Mekong Delta became a territorial dispute between Cambodians and Vietnamese. Cambodia gradually lost control of the Mekong Delta. By the 1860s French colonist had taken over the Mekong Delta and establish the colony of French Cochinchina.

====Nguyen rule====

As the Vietnamese empire consolidated itself over the eastern mainland under Gia Long and Minh Mang, Cambodia fell to the Vietnamese invasion in 1811. The invasion was initiated by the ruling king, King Ang Chan II&#x27;s (r. 1806–35) request to Gia Long to suppress his own brothers, Ang Snguon and Ang Em, who were in rebellion against him. The two brothers fled to Thailand, while Ang Chan became a Vietnamese vassal.

In 1820 Gia Long died and his fourth son Minh Mang inherited the throne. Both Minh Mang and his father were strong adherents of Confucianism, but Minh Mang was a sadistic isolationist and strong ruler. He removed the Viceroy of Cambodia and Saigon in 1832, triggered the pro-Catholic Lê Văn Khôi revolt against him in 1833. The Thai army, intended to support the rebellion, launched an offensive campaign against the Vietnamese on occupying Cambodia. This led Ang Chan to flee to Saigon, as Rama III promised to restore the Kingdom of Cambodia and punish the insolence of the Kingdom of Vietnam. In 1834, the rebellion in Southern Vietnam was suppressed, and Minh Mang ordered troops to launch the second invasion of Cambodia. This drove most of the Thai forces to the west and reinstalled Ang Chan as the puppet king in Phnom Penh, later succeeded by his daughter, Queen Ang Mey (r. 1835–41). Later that year, the Tây Thành Province was established, the Vietnamese occupied Cambodia result in direct Vietnamese control. For the next six years, the Vietnamese emperor had tried to force the Cambodians to adopt Vietnamese culture by cultural assimilation, a progress that historian David P. Chandler called &quot;The Vietnamization of Cambodia.&quot;

The death of Minh Mang in early 1841 halted the Vietnamization of Cambodia. With 35,000 Thai troops, they took advantage of the dire situation in Vietnam, rushed into the Tây Thành Province, and were able to fend off Vietnamese counteroffensives in late 1845. The new Vietnamese emperor, Thieu Tri, readied to make peace with Siam, and in June 1847 a peace treaty was signed. The Kingdom of Cambodia under Ang Duong regained its independence after 36 years of brutal Vietnamese occupations and Siamese interventions.

==Consequences and conclusions==

===European colonialism and Anglo-French rivalries===

Admiral Léonard Charner proclaimed the formal annexation of three provinces of Cochinchina into the French Empire on 31 July 1861, the beginning of the colonial era of France in South-East Asia. France&#x27;s interference in Indochina was thus a fact and the colonial community pressing to establish a commercial network in the region based on the Mekong river, ideally linking up with the gigantic market of southern China. 

Dutch author H.Th. Bussemaker has argued that these French colonial undertakings and acquisitions in the region were mere reactions to or counter-measures against British geo-strategy and economic hegemony. &quot;For the British, it was obvious that the French were trying to undercut British expansionism in India and China by interposing themselves in Indochina. The reason for this frantic expansionism was the hope that the Mekong river would prove to be navigable to the Chinese frontier, which then would open the immense Chinese market for French industrial goods.&quot; To save the kingdom&#x27;s national identity and integrity, King Ang Duong initiated secret negotiations in a letter to Napoleon III seeking to obtain some agreement of protection with France.

In June 1884, the French governor of Cochinchina, Charles Thomson went to Phnom Penh, Norodom&#x27;s capital, and demanded approval of a treaty with Paris that promised far-reaching changes such as the abolition of slavery, the institution of private land ownership, and the establishment of French résidents in provincial cities. The king reluctantly signed the agreement. The Philaster Treaty of 1874 confirmed French sovereignty over the whole of Cochin China and on 16 November 1887 the Indo-Chinese Union was established.

===Continued debate over Post-Angkor historiography===
Archaeology of Cambodia is considered to be still in its infancy. The introduction of new methods of geochronology such as LIDAR-Scanning and Luminescence dating has revealed new sets and kinds of data and studies on climate—and environmental imbalances have become more numerous in recent years. Reflection of results obviously requires time, as in an article of the US National Academy of Sciences of the year 2010, the author complains: &quot;Historians and archaeologists have, with a few notable exceptions only rarely considered the role played by environment and climate in the history of Angkor&quot;.

Widely debated remain historiography, culturalism and other aspects of the historical sources as wide contradictions suggest. Probably the greatest challenge is to synchronise all research with the conclusions of the neighbouring countries. Delicate issues exist that are rooted in this historical period (border disputes, cultural heritage), which are politically relevant and far from solved. Definitive conclusions with all contributing factors in a reasonable context are clearly future events.

<doc id="350576" wikidata="Q3173090" url="?curid=350576" title="French protectorate of Cambodia">
<text>The French protectorate of Cambodia (; ) refers to the Kingdom of Cambodia when it was a French protectorate within French Indochina, a collection of Southeast Asian protectorates within the French colonial empire. The protectorate was established in 1863 when the Cambodian King Norodom requested the establishment of a French protectorate over his country, meanwhile Siam (modern Thailand) renounced suzerainty over Cambodia and officially recognised the French protectorate on Cambodia.

Cambodia was integrated into the French Indochina union in 1887 along with the French colonies and protectorates in Laos and Vietnam (Cochinchina, Annam, and Tonkin). In 1947, Cambodia was granted self-rule within the French Union and had its protectorate status removed in 1949. Cambodia later gained independence. The day was celebrated as Independence Day on 9 November 1953.

==Start of French rule==

During the 19th century, the kingdom of Cambodia had been reduced to a vassal state of the Kingdom of Siam (Rattanakosin rule) which had annexed its western provinces, including Angkor while growing influence from the Vietnamese Nguyễn dynasty threatened the eastern portion of the country. After the French establishment of a colony in Cochinchina (present-day southern Vietnam) in 1862, King Norodom of Cambodia requested a French protectorate over his kingdom. At the time, Pierre-Paul de La Grandière, colonial governor of Cochinchina, was carrying out plans to expand French rule over the whole of Vietnam and viewed Cambodia as a buffer between French possessions in Vietnam and Siam.

On 11 August 1863, Norodom signed a treaty acknowledging a French protectorate over his kingdom. Under the treaty, the Cambodian monarchy was allowed to remain, but power was largely vested in a resident general to be housed in Phnom Penh. France was also to be in charge of Cambodia&#x27;s foreign and trade relations as well as provide military protection. Siam later recognised the protectorate after France ceded the Cambodian province of Battambang and recognised Thai control of Angkor.

==French colonial rule==

The seat of the Governor-General for the whole of French Indochina was based in Saigon until the capital moved to Hanoi in 1902. Cambodia, being a constituent protectorate of French Indochina, was governed by the &quot;Résident Supérieur&quot; (Resident-General) for Cambodia, who was directly appointed by the Ministry of Marine and Colonies in Paris. The Resident-General was in turn assisted by Residents, or local governors, who were posted in all the provincial centres, such as, Battambang, Pursat, Oudong, and Siem Reap. Phnom Penh, the capital, was under the direct administration of the Resident-General.

===Revolt of 1885–1887===
The first decades of French rule in Cambodia included numerous reforms into Cambodian politics, such as the reduction of the monarch&#x27;s power and abolition of slavery. In 1884, the governor of Cochinchina, Charles Antoine François Thomson, attempted to overthrow the monarch and establish full French control over Cambodia by sending a small force to the royal palace in Phnom Penh. The movement was only slightly successful as the governor-general of French Indochina prevented full colonisation due to possible conflicts with Cambodians and the monarch&#x27;s power was reduced to that of a figurehead.

In 1885, Si Votha, half brother of Norodom and contender for the throne, led a rebellion to dispose of the French-backed Norodom after coming back from exile in Siam. Gathering support from opposers of Norodom and the French, Si Votha led a rebellion that was primarily concentrated in the jungles of Cambodia and the city of Kampot where Oknha Kralahom &quot;Kong&quot; led the resistance. French forces later aided Norodom to defeat Si Votha under agreements that the Cambodian population be disarmed and acknowledge the resident-general as the highest power in the protectorate.
Oknha Kralahom &quot;Kong&quot; was called back to Phnom Penh to discuss peace with King Norodom and the French officials, but was taken captive by the French army and subsequently killed, officially putting an end to the rebellion.

===Administrative reorganisation===
In 1896, France and the British Empire signed an accord recognizing each other&#x27;s sphere of influence over Indochina, especially over Siam. Under this accord, Siam had to cede the province of Battambang back to the now French-controlled Cambodia. The accord acknowledged French control over Vietnam (including the colony of Cochinchina and the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin), Cambodia, as well as Laos, which was added in 1893 following French victory in the Franco-Siamese crisis and French influence over eastern Siam. The French government also later placed new administrative posts in the colony and began to develop it economically while introducing French culture and language to locals as part of an assimilation program.

In 1897, the ruling Resident-General complained to Paris that the current king of Cambodia, King Norodom was no longer fit to rule and asked for permission to assume the king&#x27;s powers to collect taxes, issue decrees, and even appoint royal officials and choose crown princes. From that time, Norodom and the future kings of Cambodia were figureheads and merely were patrons of the Buddhist religion in Cambodia, though they were still viewed as god-kings by the peasant population. All other power was in the hands of the Resident-General and the colonial bureaucracy. This bureaucracy was formed mostly of French officials, and the only Asians freely permitted to participate in government were ethnic Vietnamese, who were viewed as the dominant Asians in the Indochinese Union.

In 1904, King Norodom died and rather than pass the throne on to Norodom&#x27;s sons, the French passed the succession to Norodom&#x27;s brother Sisowath, whose branch of the royal family was nationalistic but more cooperative with the French than Norodom&#x27;s. Likewise, Norodom was viewed as responsible for the constant Cambodian revolts against French rule. Another reason was that Norodom&#x27;s favourite son, whom he wanted to succeed him as king, Prince Yukanthor, had, on one of his trips to Europe, stirred up public opinion about French colonial brutalities in occupied Cambodia.

France later tightened its control over Cambodia while expanding the protectorate&#x27;s territory in 1902 and 1904 through treaties with Siam, which added Preah Vihear Province and Champasak Province to Cambodia and gave France full control over the Bassac River respectively. Prior to Cambodia&#x27;s historical claim over Stung Treng Province, in 1904 an exchange occurred wherein Cambodia ceded Champasak and obtained Stung Treng from French Laos. Later territorial disputes between France and Siam over Battambang and Siem Reap Provinces led to the accidental French annexation of Trat Province in 1904.

Both France and Siam agreed to do a territorial exchange based on the Franco-Siamese treaty of 1907. From this, the French gained the provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap, originally Cambodian territory until the latter part of the 18th century. The acquirement of these provinces would be the last phase of French territorial expansion in Indochina as Siam would later co-operate with the British in the region, who feared uncontrolled French expansion and control of Siam would upset the balance of powers in Indochina.

==Economy during French colonialism==
Originally serving as a buffer territory for France between its more important Vietnamese colonies and Siam, Cambodia was not initially seen as an economically important area. The colonial government&#x27;s budget originally relied largely on tax collections in Cambodia as its main source of revenue, and Cambodians paid the highest taxes per capita among the French colonies in Indochina. Poor and sometimes unstable administration in the early years of French rule in Cambodia meant infrastructure and urbanisation grew at a much lesser rate than in Vietnam and traditional social structures in villages still remained.

However, as French rule consolidated after the Franco-Siamese crisis, development slowly increased in Cambodia, where rice and pepper crops allowed for the economy to grow. To foster exports, modern agricultural methods were introduced, particularly by colonial entrepreneurs who had been granted land concessions in the Battambang province (West).

As the French automobile industry grew, rubber plantations like the ones already in Cochinchina and Annam were built and run by French investors. Economic diversification continued throughout the 1920s, when corn and cotton crops were also grown. Despite economic expansion and investment, Cambodians still continued to pay high taxes and in 1916, protests broke out demanding for tax cuts.

Infrastructure and public works were also developed under French rule, and roads and railroads were constructed in Cambodian territory. Most notably, a railway connected Phnom Penh with Battambang on the Thai border.

Industry was later developed but was primarily designed to process raw materials for local use or for export. As in nearby British Burma and British Malaya, foreigners dominated the work force of the economy due to French discrimination against the Cambodians from holding important economic positions. Many Vietnamese were recruited to work on rubber plantations and later immigrants played key roles in the colonial economy as fisherman and businessmen. Chinese Cambodians continued to be largely involved in commerce but higher positions were given to the French.

==Emergence of Khmer nationalism==
Unlike in Vietnam, Cambodian nationalism remained relatively quiet during much of French rule mostly due to lesser education influence, which caused literacy rates remain low and prevented nationalist movements like those taking place in Vietnam. However, among the French-educated Cambodian elite, the Western ideas of democracy and self-rule as well as French restoration of monuments such as Angkor Wat created a sense of pride and awareness of Cambodia&#x27;s once powerful status in the past.

In education, there was also growing resentment among Cambodian students of the minority Vietnamese holding a more favoured status. In 1936, Son Ngoc Thanh and Pach Choeun began publishing Nagaravatta (&quot;Notre cité&quot;) as a French language anti-colonial and at times, anti-Vietnamese newspaper. Minor independence movements, especially the Khmer Issarak, began to develop in 1940 among Cambodians in Thailand, who feared that their actions would have led to punishment if they had operated in their homeland.

==World War II in Cambodia==
After the Fall of France in 1940, Cambodia and the rest of French Indochina were ruled by the Axis-puppet Vichy France government and despite an invasion of French Indochina, Japan allowed French colonial officials to remain in their colonies under Japanese supervision. In December 1940, the French-Thai War erupted and despite French resistance against the Japanese backed Thai forces, Japan compelled French authorities to cede Battambang, Sisophon, Siem Reap (excluding Siem Reap town) and Preah Vihear provinces to Thailand.
Japanese calls of &quot;Asia for the Asiatics&quot; found a receptive audience among Cambodian nationalists, although Tokyo&#x27;s policy in Indochina was to leave the colonial government nominally in charge. When a prominent, politically active Buddhist monk, Hem Chieu, was arrested and unceremoniously defrocked by the French authorities in July 1942, the editors of &quot;Nagaravatta&quot; led a demonstration demanding his release. They, as well as other nationalists, apparently overestimated the Japanese willingness to back them, for the Vichy authorities quickly arrested the demonstrators and gave Pach Choeun, one of the &quot;Nagaravatta&quot; editors, a life sentence. The other editor, Son Ngoc Thanh, escaped from Phnom Penh to Tokyo.

The subject of European colonies in Asia was among those discussed during the war by the Allied leaders of the Big Three, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill at the three summit meetings – Cairo Conference, Tehran Conference and Yalta Conference. With regard to the largest colony of India, Roosevelt pressed very strongly for a declaration of grant of independence by war&#x27;s end, a pressure doggedly resisted by Churchill.

In regards to non-British colonies in Asia, Roosevelt and Stalin had decided in Tehran that the French and the Dutch would not return to Asia after the war. Roosevelt&#x27;s untimely death before the war&#x27;s end, was followed by developments very different from what Roosevelt had envisaged. The British backed the return of French and Dutch rule in Asia and organised dispatches of Indian soldiers under British command for this purpose.

In an effort to enlist local support in the final months of the war, the Japanese dissolved the French colonial administration on 9 March 1945, and urged Cambodia to declare its independence within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Four days later, King Sihanouk decreed an independent Kampuchea (the original Khmer pronunciation of Cambodia). Son Ngoc Thanh returned from Tokyo in May, and was appointed foreign minister.

On 15 August 1945, the day Japan surrendered, a new government was established with Son Ngoc Thanh acting as prime minister. When an Allied force occupied Phnom Penh in October, Thanh was arrested for collaboration with the Japanese and was sent into exile in France to remain under house arrest. Some of his supporters went to north-western Cambodia, then still under Thai control, where they banded together as one faction in the Khmer Issarak movement.

==Struggle for Khmer unity==
Cambodia&#x27;s situation at the end of the war was chaotic. The Free French, under General Charles de Gaulle, were determined to recover Indochina, though they offered Cambodia and the other Indochinese protectorates a carefully circumscribed measure of self-government. Convinced that they had a &quot;civilizing mission,&quot; they envisioned Indochina&#x27;s participation in a French Union of former colonies that shared the common experience of French culture. Neither the urban professional elites nor the common people, however, were attracted by this arrangement. For Cambodians of practically all walks of life, the brief period of independence, from March to October 1945, had been enjoyable. The lassitude of the Khmer was a thing of the past.

In Phnom Penh, Sihanouk, acting as head of state, was placed in a delicate position of negotiating with the French for full independence while trying to neutralise party politicians and supporters of the Khmer Issarak and Viet Minh who considered him a French collaborator. During the tumultuous period between 1946 and 1953, Sihanouk displayed the remarkable aptitude for political survival that sustained him before and after his fall from power in March 1970. The Khmer Issarak was an extremely heterogeneous guerrilla movement, operating in the border areas.

The group included indigenous leftists, Vietnamese leftists, anti-monarchical nationalists (Khmer Serei) loyal to Son Ngoc Thanh, and plain bandits taking advantage of the chaos to terrorise villagers. Though their fortunes rose and fell during the immediate postwar period (a major blow was the overthrow of a left-wing friendly government in Bangkok in 1947), by 1954 the Khmer Issarak operating with the Viet Minh by some estimates controlled as much as 50 percent of Cambodia&#x27;s territory.

In 1946, France allowed the Cambodians to form political parties and to hold elections for a Consultative Assembly that would advise the monarch on drafting the country&#x27;s constitution. The two major parties were both headed by royal princes. The Democratic Party, led by Prince Sisowath Yuthevong, espoused immediate independence, democratic reforms, and parliamentary government. Its supporters were teachers, civil servants, politically active members of the Buddhist clergy, and others whose opinions had been greatly influenced by the nationalistic appeals of &quot;Nagaravatta&quot; before it had been closed down by the French in 1942.

Many Democrats sympathised with the violent methods of the Khmer Issarak. The Liberal Party, led by Prince Norodom Norindeth, represented the interests of the old rural elites, including large landowners. They preferred continuing some form of the colonial relationship with France, and advocated gradual democratic reform. In the Consultative Assembly election held in September 1946, the Democrats won 50 of 67 seats.

With a solid majority in the assembly, the Democrats drafted a constitution modelled on that of the French Fourth Republic. Power was concentrated in the hands of a popularly elected National Assembly. The king reluctantly proclaimed the new constitution on 6 May 1947. While it recognised him as the &quot;spiritual head of the state,&quot; it reduced him to the status of a constitutional monarch, and it left unclear the extent to which he could play an active role in the politics of the nation. Sihanouk would turn this ambiguity to his advantage in later years, however.

In the December 1947 elections for the National Assembly, the Democrats again won a large majority. Despite this, dissension within the party was rampant. Its founder, Sisowath Yuthevong, had died and no clear leader had emerged to succeed him. During the period 1948 to 1949, the Democrats appeared united only in their opposition to legislation sponsored by the king or his appointees. A major issue was the king&#x27;s receptivity to independence within the French Union, proposed in a draft treaty offered by the French in late 1948. Following dissolution of the National Assembly in September 1949, agreement on the pact was reached through an exchange of letters between King Sihanouk and the French government. It went into effect two months later, though National Assembly ratification of the treaty was never secured.

The treaty granted Cambodia what Sihanouk called &quot;fifty percent independence&quot;: by it, the colonial relationship was formally ended, and the Cambodians were given control of most administrative functions. Cambodian armed forces were granted freedom of action within a self-governing autonomous zone comprising Battambang and Siemreab provinces, which had been recovered from Thailand after World War II, but which the French, hard-pressed elsewhere, did not have the resources to control. Cambodia was still required to co-ordinate foreign policy matters with the High Council of the French Union, however, and France retained a significant measure of control over the judicial system, finances, and customs.

Control of wartime military operations outside the autonomous zone remained in French hands. France was also permitted to maintain military bases on Cambodian territory. In 1950 Cambodia was accorded diplomatic recognition by the United States and by most non-communist powers, but in Asia only Thailand and South Korea extended recognition.

The Democrats won a majority in the second National Assembly election in September 1951, and they continued their policy of opposing the king on practically all fronts. In an effort to win greater popular approval, Sihanouk asked the French to release nationalist Son Ngoc Thanh from exile and to allow him to return to his country. He made a triumphant entry into Phnom Penh on 29 October 1951. It was not long, however, before he began demanding withdrawal of French troops from Cambodia.

He reiterated this demand in early 1952 in &quot;Khmer Krok&quot; (Khmer Awake!) a weekly newspaper that he had founded. The newspaper was forced to cease publication in March, and Son Ngoc Thanh fled the capital with a few armed followers to join the Khmer Issarak. Branded alternately a communist and an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by Sihanouk, he remained in exile until Lon Nol established the Khmer Republic in 1970.

==Campaign for independence==

In June 1952, Sihanouk announced the dismissal of his cabinet, suspended the constitution, and assumed control of the government as prime minister. Then, without clear constitutional sanction, he dissolved the National Assembly and proclaimed martial law in January 1953. Sihanouk exercised direct rule for almost three years, from June 1952 until February 1955. After dissolution of the assembly, he created an Advisory Council to supplant the legislature and appointed his father, Norodom Suramarit, as regent.

In March 1953, Sihanouk went to France. Ostensibly, he was travelling for his health; actually, he was mounting an intensive campaign to persuade the French government to grant complete independence. The climate of opinion in Cambodia at the time was such that if he did not achieve full independence quickly, the people were likely to turn to Son Ngoc Thanh and the Khmer Issarak, who were fully committed to attaining that goal. At meetings with the French president and with other high officials, Sihanouk was suggested as being unduly &quot;alarmist&quot; about internal political conditions. The French also made the thinly veiled threat that, if he continued to be uncooperative, they might replace him. The trip appeared to be a failure, but on his way home by way of the United States, Canada, and Japan, Sihanouk publicised Cambodia&#x27;s plight in the media.

To further dramatise his &quot;royal crusade for independence,&quot; Sihanouk declared that he would not return until the French gave assurances that full independence would be granted. He then left Phnom Penh in June to go into self-imposed exile in Thailand. Unwelcome in Bangkok, he moved to his royal villa near the ruins of Angkor in Siemreab Province. Siemreab, part of the autonomous military zone established in 1949, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Lon Nol, formerly a right-wing politician who was becoming a prominent, and in time would be an indispensable Sihanouk ally within the military. From his Siemreab base, the king and Lon Nol contemplated plans for resistance if the French did not meet their terms.

Sihanouk was making a high-stakes gamble, for the French could easily have replaced him with a more pliable monarch; however, the military situation was deteriorating throughout Indochina, and the French government, on 3 July 1953, declared itself ready to grant full independence to the three states of Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos. Sihanouk insisted on his own terms, which included full control of national defence, the police, the courts, and financial matters.

The French yielded: the police and the judiciary were transferred to Cambodian control at the end of August, and in October the country assumed full command of its military forces. King Sihanouk, now a hero in the eyes of his people, returned to Phnom Penh in triumph and independence day was celebrated on 9 November 1953. Control of residual matters affecting sovereignty, such as financial and budgetary affairs, passed to the new Cambodian state in 1954.

<text>Julie Payette (; born October 20, 1963) is a Canadian engineer, scientist and former astronaut who served from 2017 to 2021 as Governor General of Canada, the 29th since Canadian Confederation.

Payette holds engineering degrees from McGill University and the University of Toronto. She worked as a research scientist before joining the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) in 1992 as a member of the Canadian Astronaut Corps. She completed two spaceflights, STS-96 and STS-127, and has logged more than 25 days in space. She also served as capsule communicator at NASA Mission Control Center in Houston and from 2000 to 2007 as CSA&#x27;s chief astronaut.

In July 2013, Payette was named chief operating officer for the Montreal Science Centre. She also held a number of board appointments, including the National Bank of Canada. On July 13, 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Queen Elizabeth II had approved the appointment of Payette as the next governor general of Canada. She was invested on October 2, 2017.

Payette resigned on January 21, 2021, following the conclusion of a workplace review that found she had &quot;belittled, berated and publicly humiliated Rideau Hall staff&quot; and &quot;created a toxic, verbally abusive workplace&quot;. The review was initiated by the Privy Council Office to investigate accusations of harassment of civil servants in the Office of the Governor General. The report&#x27;s official goal was not to validate nor make findings of fact, as it only relied on what interview participants reported. She is the second governor general to have resigned the office, after Roméo LeBlanc (who resigned due to health issues), the first to resign due to scandal, and the first to have left a vacancy upon resignation.

== Education and early career ==

Payette was born on October 20, 1963, in Montreal, Quebec, and lived in the Ahuntsic neighbourhood, attending Collège Mont-Saint-Louis and Collège Regina Assumpta. In 1982 she completed an International Baccalaureate diploma at the United World College of the Atlantic in South Wales, United Kingdom.

For her undergraduate studies, Payette enrolled in McGill University where she completed a Bachelor of Engineering degree in electrical engineering in 1986, after which she completed a Master of Applied Science degree in computer engineering at the University of Toronto in 1990. Her thesis focused on computational linguistics, a field of artificial intelligence. She is a retired member of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec.

She speaks French and English, some Spanish, Italian, Russian and German.

During her schooling, between 1986 and 1988, Payette also worked as a systems engineer for IBM Canada&#x27;s Science Engineering division. From 1988 to 1990, as a graduate student at the University of Toronto, she was involved in a high-performance computer architecture project and worked as a teaching assistant. At the beginning of 1991, Payette joined the communications and science department of the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory in Switzerland, for a one-year visiting scientist appointment. When she returned to Canada, in January 1992, she joined the Speech Research Group of Bell-Northern Research in Montreal where she was responsible for a project in telephone speech comprehension using computer voice recognition.

== Canadian Space Agency ==

Payette was selected by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) as one of four astronauts from a field of 5,330 applicants in June 1992. After undergoing basic training in Canada, she worked as a technical advisor for the Mobile Servicing System, an advanced robotics system and Canada&#x27;s contribution to the International Space Station. In 1993, Payette established the Human-Computer Interaction Group at the Canadian Astronaut Program and served as a technical specialist on the NATO International Research Study Group on speech processing.

In preparation for a space assignment, Payette obtained her commercial pilot licence and logged 120 hours as a research operator on reduced gravity aircraft. In April 1996, Payette was certified as a one-atmosphere deep sea diving suit operator. Payette obtained her captaincy on the CT-114 Tutor military jet at CFB Moose Jaw in February 1996 and her military instrument rating in 1997. Payette has logged more than 1,300 hours of flight time, including 600 hours on high-performance jet aircraft.

Payette reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996 to begin mission specialist training. After completing one year of training, she was assigned to work on the Mobile Servicing System. Payette completed the initial astronaut training in April 1998.

=== Spaceflight experience ===

Payette served as chief astronaut for the Canadian Space Agency from 2000 to 2007. She also worked as capsule communicator at the Mission Control Center in Houston for several years, including the return to flight mission STS-114. She was lead capsule communicator during STS-121.

==== STS-96 ====

Payette flew on the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; from May 27 to June 6, 1999, as part of the crew of STS-96. During the mission, the crew performed the first manual docking of the shuttle to the International Space Station, and delivered four tons of logistics and supplies to the station. On &quot;Discovery&quot;, Payette served as a mission specialist. Her main responsibility was to operate the Canadarm robotic arm from the space station. The STS-96 mission was accomplished in 153 orbits of the Earth, traveling over in 9 days, 19 hours and 13 minutes. Payette became the first Canadian to participate in an ISS assembly mission and to board the Space Station.

==== STS-127 ====

Payette visited the space station again in 2009 as a mission specialist aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; during mission STS-127 from July 15 to 31, 2009, and was the flight engineer and lead robotic operator during the mission. At that time, Robert Thirsk was a member of Expedition 20 on the space station. &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s docking at the space station marked the first time two Canadians met in space.

During her second mission, Payette brought a signed sweater of the famed Montreal Canadiens player Maurice Richard, stating she had brought Richard, who was known as &quot;The Rocket&quot;, into the rocket to celebrate the hockey team&#x27;s 100th anniversary.

== Post-CSA ==

During 2011–2013, she worked at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., and was also a scientific delegate to the United States for the Quebec Government.

For the next three years, Payette was chief operating officer of the Montreal Science Centre of the Société du Vieux-Port de Montréal. During that time, she was also a vice president of the Canada Lands Company. She abruptly left the Science Centre after a prolonged strike, as she was tired of the battles that came with her position. Prior to her departure numerous employees came forward alleging verbal abuse that created a hostile working environment, as Payette was &quot;intimidating&quot; and &quot;determined to be very hands-on and in control of every aspect&quot;.

In April 2016, Payette was appointed to the board of the Canadian Olympic Committee, and attended the 2016 Summer Olympics. She left the Canadian Olympic Committee in 2017 after two internal investigations into her treatment of staff including verbal harassment. In about 2017, she was appointed to the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s Women in Sports Commission.

Payette has served on boards of directors, at Queen&#x27;s University, Canada&#x27;s Own the Podium Olympic program, Montreal Science Centre foundation, Robotique FIRST Québec, Drug Free Kids Canada, the Montreal Bach Festival, the National Bank of Canada, Développement Aéroport Saint-Hubert de Longueuil, and others. She is a member of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec and a fellow of the International Academy of Astronautics. As well, Payette is a member of the Faculty of Engineering Advisory Board of McGill University.

== Governor General of Canada ==

Payette was announced on July 13, 2017, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s recommendation to be the 29th Governor General of Canada. She was scheduled to take office October 2, 2017, after the completion of briefings from the incumbent, David Johnston. After the announcement was made, Johnston issued a statement congratulating Payette and welcoming &quot;a Canadian of extraordinary achievement, admired by all&quot;.

As governor general-designate, Payette had her first official meeting with Queen Elizabeth II on September 20, 2017, at Balmoral Castle, when she was also invested by Her Majesty as an extraordinary Companion of the Order of Canada (CC), an extraordinary Commander of the Order of Military Merit (CMM), and a Commander of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces (COM).

Payette was installed as governor general on October 2, 2017. Afterwards, she urged Canadians to work together on issues such as climate change, migration and poverty. &quot;Anyone can accomplish anything and rise to the challenge as long as they are willing to work with others, to let go of the personal agenda, to reach a higher goal and to do what is right for the common good. This is exactly what I hope my mandate as the governor-general will reflect&quot;, Payette said.

=== Tenure ===

As she was completing her first year as the viceregal representative in September 2018, Payette faced some criticism about controversial comments she had made against those who believe in creationism and those who did not believe in climate change. At the Canadian Science Policy Conference the next month, she argued strongly for greater public acceptance of science, saying that too many people believe in astrology, deny climate change, and believe that &quot;maybe taking a sugar pill will cure cancer&quot;. A &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; article described her remarks as &quot;refreshing&quot;. George Dvorsky from Gizmodo.com stated &quot;Her words were a breath of fresh air&quot;.

In subsequent comments, Payette emphasized the importance of debate and critical thinking but admitted that she was still growing into her role and needed more time to adapt to the position. &quot;I learned that you have to be careful about how you say things, but not what you say&quot;, she added. Some time later, she offered an additional explanation to CPAC. &quot;I made a speech as I had as an astronaut and I&#x27;m not an astronaut any longer, I&#x27;m governor general. I represent all Canadians. I&#x27;ve learned those lessons.&quot;

Weeks later, she faced criticism about her work ethic, with some suggesting that she had not devoted enough time and dedication to the role of governor general, noting that she had not visited several of the provinces in her nearly 12-month tenure. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; published specifics confirming the more numerous appearances her two predecessors had made per year. Rideau Hall spokesperson Marie-Ève Létourneau said that &quot;The first year of every mandate is a period of learning, adjustment and adaptation from both the Governor General and Rideau Hall staff.&quot; The Governor General office&#x27;s lengthy review of patronage activities, that her predecessors had automatically done by longstanding tradition, left several established non-profit groups without committed support from the office and facing organizational changes.

Later in September, the Governor General&#x27;s office confirmed that Payette would not preside over the 2018 Governor General&#x27;s History Awards ceremony.

On September 27, Payette acknowledged the articles that had painted an &quot;unfavourable image of our work&quot; in an e-mail to staff, expressed regret about the effect of the criticisms on morale, and assured them that she was &quot;very proud of all we have achieved together to date&quot;.

During Payette&#x27;s tenure, the media also raised concerns over questionable spending projects at Rideau Hall and her refusal to move in to Rideau Hall after renovations were complete. It was reported that the spending included around $140,000 on &quot;studying and designing a private staircase that was never built&quot; and $117,500 on &quot;a gate and series of doors to keep people away from Payette&#x27;s office&quot;. With much of the grounds of Rideau Hall open to the public, it was, however, recognized that there were current accessibility, privacy and security concerns, especially in light of the July 2nd security breach on the grounds by Corey Hurren.

=== Resignation ===

On July 21, 2020, CBC News reported that Payette had allegedly created a toxic work environment at Rideau Hall by verbally abusing employees. Two days later, spurred on by the CBC News report, the Privy Council Office formally launched an investigation into her conduct. Many former employees of the Montreal Science Centre told the &quot;National Post&quot; they witnessed similarly abusive behaviour by Payette in her time at the institution, although others described her behaviour as the result of rigorously high standards. Payette said that she supported the investigation into the workplace harassment. The Privy Council Office&#x27;s independent report found that Payette presided over a toxic work environment, detailing &quot;yelling, screaming, aggressive conduct, demeaning comments and public humiliations.&quot;

On January 21, 2021, in what CBC News described as &quot;an unprecedented move&quot;, Payette announced her resignation as governor general (which was effective the following day) after the completion of an independent workplace review of several claims of workplace harassment (in the form of, &quot;belittling, berating and publicly humiliating&quot; staff), as remaining in her post &quot;would risk inflicting serious damage on the office&quot;. The secretary to the governor general played a critical role in Payette&#x27;s downfall. Payette&#x27;s commission as Governor General was formally terminated by royal letters patent issued on January 22.

Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of Canada, was sworn in as Administrator on January 23, 2021.

Trudeau was criticized by 15 sources interviewed by the CBC for failing to vet Payette properly, as the PMO did not conduct checks with Payette&#x27;s past employers (Montreal Science Centre and Canadian Olympic Committee) that could have uncovered that her style and temperament were unsuited for the diplomatically sensitive and public role of Governor General.

As a result of her resignation, renewed scrutiny arose around the pension and benefits afforded to retired governors general. Under current law, she will receive a lifetime pension of nearly $150,000 and also can claim an additional $206,000 in expenses each year. Carleton University academic Philippe Lagassé has speculated that Payette&#x27;s decision to resign may have been motivated by her desire to protect her entitlements, as Parliament would be unlikely to retroactively reduce them.

== Personal life ==

Payette has been married and divorced twice, first to François Brissette in the 1990s, and secondly to William Flynn, with whom she had a son in 2003, and from whom she divorced in 2015. Payette plays the piano and has sung with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and Tafelmusik Chamber Choir. Currently, she sings with the Ottawa Bach Choir. Among her other hobbies are running, skiing, racquet sports, and scuba diving.

In July 2011, Payette was driving and struck and killed a pedestrian who had stepped off a curb to cross the road when she should not have. The case was closed in 2012 as she was found not at fault.

She was also charged with second degree assault in Maryland, on November 24, 2011. At least one anonymously quoted source has alleged that the victim of the assault was her then-husband, Billie Flynn. Though the charges were later dropped, the couple split several weeks later and subsequently divorced. Payette has stated that charges were &quot;unfounded&quot; but refused to comment further on the circumstances leading to her being charged with assault. These incidents raised questions on the vetting process as she had been selected by Prime Minister Trudeau without consulting an ad hoc committee of experts. Such a committee was the means by which outgoing Governor General David Johnston had been selected by the Conservative government of Stephen Harper. Once Payette was named Governor General-designate, media organizations pressed for the release of the divorce records, which Payette initially attempted to keep sealed before abandoning the bid.

<text>After decades of conflict, Cambodia&#x27;s modern era began in 1993 with the restoration of the monarchy and end of the State of Cambodia and the United Nations Transitional Authority after general elections were held. Since 1993, the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party have consistently been in government, and consolidated power in a 1997 coup d&#x27;état. Hun Sen was prime minister until transfer of power to his son, Hun Manet, in 2023.
== Background ==

After the fall of the Pol Pot regime of Democratic Kampuchea, Cambodia was under Vietnamese occupation and a pro-Hanoi government, the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea, was established. A civil war raged during the 1980s opposing the government&#x27;s Kampuchean People&#x27;s Revolutionary Armed Forces against the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, a government in exile composed of three Cambodian political factions: Prince Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s FUNCINPEC party, the Party of Democratic Kampuchea (often referred to as the Khmer Rouge) and the Khmer People&#x27;s National Liberation Front (KPNLF).

Peace efforts intensified in 1989 and 1991 with two international conferences in Paris, and a United Nations peacekeeping mission helped maintain a ceasefire. As a part of the peace effort, United Nations-sponsored elections were held in 1993 and helped restore some semblance of normality, as did the rapid diminishment of the Khmer Rouge in the mid-1990s. Norodom Sihanouk was reinstated as King. A coalition government, formed after national elections in 1998, brought renewed political stability and the surrender of remaining Khmer Rouge forces in 1998.

==Political aspects and elections==

Since the restoration of what is referred to as multi-party democracy in 1993, the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party (CPP) has been in a coalition with the royalist Funcinpec party however the CPP has been the majority party following the 1997 Coup and purge against the FUNCINPEC. Hun Sen is the longest serving non-royal leader in Southeast Asia and is one of the longest serving prime ministers in the world, having been in power through various coalitions since 1985. He became sole Prime Minister on 30 November 1998 and would go on to lead the CPP to victory in the next three elections, but has been accused of poll fraud and corruption. He stepped down after five terms, with his son taking on the role of Prime Minister in 23 July 2023.

One of the world&#x27;s longest-serving leaders, with a reputation as a &#x27;wily operator who destroys his political opponents&#x27;, Hun Sen is widely viewed as a dictator that has assumed authoritarian power in Cambodia using violence and intimidation and corruption to maintain his power base. 
Hun Sen has accumulated highly centralized power in Cambodia, including a &#x27;praetorian guard that appears to rival the capabilities of the country&#x27;s regular military units.&#x27;

From July 30 to August 30, 1989, representatives of 18 countries, the four Cambodian parties, and Secretary-General of the United Nations Javier Pérez de Cuéllar met in Paris in an effort to negotiate a comprehensive settlement. They hoped to achieve those objectives seen as crucial to the future of post-occupation Cambodia: a verified withdrawal of the remaining Vietnamese occupation troops and genuine self-determination for the Cambodian people.

On October 23, 1991, the Paris Conference convened to sign a comprehensive settlement giving the UN full authority to supervise a ceasefire, repatriate the displaced Khmer along the border with Thailand, disarm and demobilize the factional armies, and prepare the country for free and fair elections.

Prince Sihanouk, President of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia (SNC), and other members of the SNC returned to Phnom Penh in November, 1991, to begin the resettlement process in Cambodia. The UN Advance Mission for Cambodia (UNAMIC) was deployed at the same time to maintain liaison among the factions and begin demining operations to expedite the repatriation of approximately 370,000 Cambodians from Thailand.

On March 16, 1992, the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), under UNSYG Special Representative Yasushi Akashi and Lt. General John Sanderson, arrived in Cambodia to begin implementation of the UN Settlement Plan. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees began full-scale repatriation in March 1992. UNTAC grew into a 22,000 strong civilian and military peacekeeping force to conduct free and fair elections for a constituent assembly.

Over four million Cambodians (about 90% of eligible voters) participated in the May 1993 elections, although the Khmer Rouge or Party of Democratic Kampuchea (PDK), whose forces were never actually disarmed or demobilized, barred some people from participating in the 10-15 percent of the country (holding six percent of the population) it then controlled.

Prince Norodom Ranariddh&#x27;s FUNCINPEC Party was the top vote recipient with 45.5% vote followed by Hun Sen&#x27;s Cambodian People&#x27;s Party and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, respectively. FUNCINPEC then entered into a coalition with the other parties that had participated in the elections.

The parties represented in the 120-member Assembly proceeded to draft and approve a new Constitution, which was promulgated September 24. It established a multiparty liberal democracy in the framework of a constitutional monarchy, with the former Prince Sihanouk elevated to King. Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen became First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively, in the Royal Cambodian Government (RCG). The Constitution provides for a wide range of internationally recognized human rights, however Cambodia is a &quot;vaguely communist free-market state with a relatively authoritarian coalition ruling over a superficial democracy.&quot;

==1997 coup==
In 1997, factional fighting between FUNCINPEC supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh and of Hun Sen broke out, resulting in a number of casualties. This event was generally treated by the press, as well as by some scholars, as a &quot;bloody coup by strongman Hun Sen&quot;, without much serious and neutral investigation into its causes and its development. Among the very few who attempted to look at evidence from both sides at the time were Australian ambassador to Cambodia Tony Kevin, and journalist Barry Wain, who wrote, &quot;in circumstances that remain disputed, Mr. Hun Sen&#x27;s military forces... defeated Prince Ranariddh&#x27;s troops in Phnom Penh&quot;.

Hun Sen had alleged that Ranariddh had been planning a take-over with the help of Khmer Rouge fighters, supposedly smuggled into the capital (on the other hand, Hun Sen&#x27;s army included a number of ex-Khmer rouge fighters). After the royalist resistance was crushed in Phnom Penh, there was indeed some FUCINPEC-Khmer Rouge in the Northern provinces, where the fighting against Hun Sen offensive lasted until August 1997.

Following the coup Prince Ranariddh went into exile to Paris. Some FUNCINPEC leaders were forced to flee the country, many were shot and Ung Huot was elected as the new First Prime Minister. 
FUNCINPEC leaders returned to Cambodia shortly before the 1998 National Assembly elections. In those elections, the CPP received 41% of the vote, FUNCINPEC 32%, and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) 13%. Many international observers judged the elections to have been seriously flawed, claiming political violence, intimidation, and lack of media access. The CPP and FUNCINPEC formed another coalition government, with CPP the senior partner.

== Cambodia since 2000 ==
Cambodia&#x27;s first commune elections were held in February 2002. These elections to select chiefs and members of 1,621 commune (municipality) councils also were marred by political violence and fell short of being free and fair by international standards. The election results were largely acceptable to the major parties, though procedures for the new local councils have not been fully implemented.

A riot occurred in January 2003 in which the Embassy of Thailand and several Thai businesses were damaged. Following the incident, Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed the RGC&#x27;s regret to the Thai Government and promised compensation. See Anti-Thai Cambodian riots of 2003

On July 27, 2003, elections were held and the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party of Prime Minister Hun Sen won a majority, but not enough to rule outright. The King has urged the two other parties, Sam Rainsy Party and FUNCINPEC, to accept the incumbent Hun Sen as prime minister. In mid-2004 a coalition government was formed between FUNCINPEC and the CPP.

In 2004, King Sihanouk, still in poor health, announced his abdication of the throne. Prince Norodom Ranariddh was one of the leading candidates to succeed Sihanouk, but the Royal Council of the Throne selected Prince Norodom Sihamoni, as the new king. A sign of Cambodia&#x27;s modernization is the construction of skyscrapers and Phnom Penh&#x27;s satellite city, Camko City. As a result of modernization, many problems such as illegal deforestation are occurring.

After the 2013 Cambodian general election, allegations of voter fraud from opposition party Cambodia National Rescue Party led to widespread anti-government protests that continued into the following year. The protests ended after a crackdown by government forces.

The Cambodia National Rescue Party was dissolved ahead of the 2018 Cambodian general election and the ruling Cambodian People&#x27;s Party also enacted tighter curbs on mass media. The CPP won every seat in the National Assembly without a major opposition, effectively solidifying &quot;de facto&quot; one-party rule in the country.

Cambodia&#x27;s longtime Prime Minister Hun Sen, one of the world&#x27;s longest-serving leaders, has a very firm grip on power. He has been accused of the crackdown on opponents and critics. His Cambodian People&#x27;s Party (CPP) has been in power since 1979. In December 2021, Prime Minister Hun Sen announced his support for his son Hun Manet to succeed him after the next election, which is expected to take place in 2023.

In July 2023 election, the ruling Cambodian People&#x27;s Party (CPP) easily won by landslide in flawed election, after disqualification of Cambodia&#x27;s most important opposition, Candlelight Party. On 22 August 2023, Hun Manet was sworn in as the new Cambodian prime minister.

==Controversial resettlement of refugees==

Australia is paying Cambodia money to resettle asylum seekers who arrived by boat on Australian shores. Australia is expected to give Cambodia tens of millions of dollars for accepting the refugees who will be expected to assimilate into a society where &#x27;40 per cent of people live in poverty&#x27;. They will have no rights to be transferred to another country. That action has been met with widespread condemnation by human rights groups.

Cambodia, a resource sparse country with a large number of poor people is thought to be unfit for use as a resettlement area because of its poverty and human rights abuses, also because the people being resettled are unable to do some of the most basic things like opening bank accounts. Rights groups accuse Cambodia of playing politics in the past with refugees and using them as bargaining chips in bilateral relations, pointing to the deportation of 20 ethnic Uighur asylum seekers to China in 2009. Beijing announced a $1 billion aid package for Phnom Penh two days later.

Sam Rainsy a political opposition leader commented on the refugee situation from Australia: &#x27;Cambodia is one of the world&#x27;s most corrupt countries. This government has made Cambodia one of the world&#x27;s poorest countries. So any money, especially from any foreign source, would be diverted and channeled into the pocket of our corrupt leaders with very little, if any, benefit to the ordinary people.&#x27;

==Corruption==

Cambodia still faces numerous challenges and sociopolitical issues that stunt its development as a nation. In 2013, Cambodia scored a 20 out of a scale of a 100 (highly clean) to 0 (highly corrupt) on the 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index, which also ranked the nation as the a ranking of 160 out of 175 nations (tied with other nations) making the nation one of the most corrupt in the world and Cambodia is the 2nd most corrupt nation in Asia with North Korea being the 1st. According to Freedom House in their 2013 report Cambodia scored a 5.5 out of a scale of 1 (Free) to 7 (Not Free) indicating that Cambodia as a nation is &#x27;Not Free&#x27;.

Hun Sen and his government have seen much controversy. Hun Sen was a former Khmer Rouge commander who was originally installed by the Vietnamese and, after the Vietnamese left the country, maintains his strong man position by violence and oppression when deemed necessary. In 1997, fearing the growing power of his co-Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun launched a coup, using the army to purge Ranariddh and his supporters. Ranariddh was ousted and fled to Paris while other opponents of Hun Sen were arrested, tortured and some summarily executed.

In addition to political oppression, the Cambodian government has been accused of corruption in the sale of vast areas of land to foreign investors resulting in the eviction of thousands of villagers as well as taking bribes in exchange for grants to exploit Cambodia&#x27;s oil wealth and mineral resources. Cambodia is consistently listed as one of the most corrupt governments in the world. Amnesty International currently recognizes one prisoner of conscience in the country: 29-year-old land rights activist Yorm Bopha. In 2014, Transparency International released a National Integrity System Assessment on Cambodia detailing systemic corruption across the country&#x27;s governance system.

== Economy and human development ==

As of 2013, the Human Development Index (HDI) ranks Cambodia 138th place (tied with Laos) making the nation one of the lowest ranking in terms of human development and that it indicates that Cambodia has lower medium to low development presently. Cambodia is a low income economy with it having one of the lowest annual incomes in the world with the agriculture sector dominating the country&#x27;s economy, followed by the service and industrial sectors. According to the Global Hunger Index, Cambodia currently ranks as the 32nd hungriest nation in the world out of the list of the 56 nations with the worst hunger situation(s) in the world.

Cambodia is a low-income economy, with two million people living in poverty, endemic government corruption and a poor record on human rights. One third of the population live on less than a dollar a day. Forty per cent of children are chronically malnourished.

<text>Sidney Aaron &quot;Paddy&quot; Chayefsky (; January 29, 1923 – August 1, 1981) was an American playwright, screenwriter and novelist. He is the only person to have won three solo Academy Awards for writing both adapted and original screenplays.

He was one of the most renowned dramatists of the Golden Age of Television. His intimate, realistic scripts provided a naturalistic style of television drama for the 1950s, dramatizing the lives of ordinary Americans. Martin Gottfried wrote in &quot;All His Jazz&quot; that Chayefsky was &quot;the most successful graduate of television&#x27;s slice of life school of naturalism.&quot;

Following his critically acclaimed teleplays, Chayefsky became a noted playwright and novelist. As a screenwriter, he received three Academy Awards for &quot;Marty&quot; (1955), &quot;The Hospital&quot; (1971) and &quot;Network&quot; (1976). The movie &quot;Marty&quot; was based on his own television drama about two lonely people finding love. &quot;Network&quot; was a satire of the television industry and &quot;The Hospital&quot; was also satiric. Film historian David Thomson called &quot;The Hospital&quot; &quot;years ahead of its time.… Few films capture the disaster of America&#x27;s self-destructive idealism so well.&quot; His screenplay for &quot;Network&quot; is often regarded as his masterpiece, and has been hailed as &quot;the kind of literate, darkly funny and breathtakingly prescient material that prompts many to claim it as the greatest screenplay of the 20th century.&quot;

Chayefsky&#x27;s early stories were frequently influenced by the author&#x27;s childhood in The Bronx. Chayefsky was part of the inaugural class of inductees into the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; Television Hall of Fame. He received this honor three years after his death, in 1984.

==Early life==

Sidney Aaron Chayefsky was born in the Bronx, New York City, to Russian-Jewish immigrants Harry and Gussie (Stuchevsky) Chayefsky. Harry Chayefsky&#x27;s father served for twenty-five years in the Russian army so the family was allowed to live in Moscow, while Gussie Stuchevsky lived in a village near Odessa. Harry and Gussie immigrated to the United States in 1907 and 1909 respectively.

Harry Chayefsky worked for a New Jersey milk distribution company in which he eventually took a controlling interest and renamed Dellwood Dairies. The family lived in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and Mount Vernon, New York, moving temporarily to Bailey Avenue in the West Bronx at the time of Sidney Chayefsky&#x27;s birth while a larger house in Mount Vernon was being completed. He had two older brothers, William and Winn.

As a toddler Chayefsky showed signs of being gifted, and could &quot;speak intelligently&quot; at two and a half. His father suffered a financial reversal during the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and the family moved back to the Bronx. Chayefsky attended a public elementary school. As a boy, Chayefsky was noted for his verbal ability, which won him friends. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School, where he served as editor of the school&#x27;s literary magazine &quot;The Magpie&quot;. He graduated from Clinton in 1939 at age 16 and attended the City College of New York, graduating with a degree in social sciences in 1943. While at City College he played for the semi-professional football team Kingsbridge Trojans. He studied languages at Fordham University during his Army service.

===Military service===
In 1943, two weeks before his graduation from City College, Chayefsky was drafted into the United States Army, and served in combat in Europe. While in the Army he adopted the nickname &quot;Paddy.&quot; The nickname was given spontaneously when he was awakened at dawn for kitchen duty. Although actually Jewish, he asked to be excused to attend Mass. &quot;Sure you do, Paddy,&quot; said the officer, and the name stuck.

Chayefsky was wounded by a land mine while serving with the 104th Infantry Division in the European Theatre near Aachen, Germany. He was awarded the Purple Heart. The wound left him badly scarred, contributing to his shyness around women. While recovering from his injuries in the Army Hospital near Cirencester, England, he wrote the book and lyrics to a musical comedy, &quot;No T.O. for Love&quot;. First produced in 1945 by the Special Services Unit, the show toured European Army bases for two years.

The London opening of &quot;No T.O. for Love&quot; at the Scala Theatre in the West End was the beginning of Chayefsky&#x27;s theatrical career. During the London production of this musical, Chayefsky encountered Joshua Logan, a future collaborator, and Garson Kanin, who invited Chayefsky to collaborate with him on a documentary of the Allied invasion, &quot;The True Glory&quot;.

== Career ==

=== 1940s ===
Returning to the United States, Chayefsky worked in his uncle&#x27;s print shop, Regal Press, an experience which provided a background for his later teleplay, &quot;Printer&#x27;s Measure&quot; (1953), as well as his story for the movie &quot;As Young as You Feel&quot; (1951). Kanin enabled Chayefsky to spend time working on his second play, &quot;Put Them All Together&quot; (later known as &quot;M is for Mother&quot;), but it was never produced. Producers Mike Gordon and Jerry Bressler gave him a junior writer&#x27;s contract. He wrote a story, &quot;The Great American Hoax&quot;, which sold to &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; but was never published.

Chayefsky went to Hollywood in 1947 with the aim of becoming a screenwriter. His friends Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon found him a job in the accounting office of Universal Pictures. He studied acting at the Actor&#x27;s Lab and Kanin got him a bit part in the film &quot;A Double Life&quot;. He returned to New York, submitted scripts, and was hired as an apprentice scriptwriter by Universal. His script outlines were not accepted and he was fired after six weeks. After returning to New York, Chayefsky wrote the outline for a play that he submitted to the William Morris Agency. The agency, treating it as a novella, submitted it to Good Housekeeping magazine. Movie rights were purchased by Twentieth Century Fox, Chayefsky was hired to write the script, and he returned to Hollywood in 1948. But Chayefsky was discouraged by the studio system, which involved rewrites and relegated writers to inferior roles, so he quit and moved back to New York, vowing not to return.

During the late 1940s, he began working full-time on short stories and radio scripts, and during that period, he was a gagwriter for radio host Robert Q. Lewis. Chayefsky later recalled, &quot;I sold some plays to men who had an uncanny ability not to raise money.&quot;

=== Early 1950s ===
During 1951–52, Chayefsky wrote adaptations for radio&#x27;s &quot;Theater Guild on the Air&quot;: &quot;The Meanest Man in the World&quot; (with James Stewart), &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot;, &quot;Tommy&quot; (with Van Heflin and Ruth Gordon and &quot;Over 21&quot; (with Wally Cox).

His play &quot;The Man Who Made the Mountain Shake&quot; was noticed by Elia Kazan, and his wife, Molly Kazan, helped Chayefsky with revisions. It was retitled &quot;Fifth From Garibaldi&quot; but was never produced. In 1951, the movie &quot;As Young as You Feel&quot; was adapted from a Chayefsky story.
He moved into television with scripts for &quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;The Gulf Playhouse&quot; and &quot;Manhunt&quot;. &quot;Philco Television Playhouse&quot; producer Fred Coe saw the &quot;Danger&quot; and &quot;Manhunt&quot; episodes and enlisted Chayefsky to adapt the story &quot;It Happened on the Brooklyn Subway&quot; about a photographer on a New York City Subway train who reunites a concentration camp survivor with his long-lost wife. Chayefsky&#x27;s first script to be telecast was a 1949 adaptation of Budd Schulberg&#x27;s &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot; for &quot;Philco&quot;.

Since he had always wanted to use a synagogue as backdrop, he wrote &quot;Holiday Song&quot;, telecast in 1952 and also in 1954. He submitted more work to &quot;Philco&quot;, including &quot;Printer&#x27;s Measure&quot;, &quot;The Bachelor Party&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Big Deal&quot; (1953).

The seventh season of &quot;Philco Television Playhouse&quot; began September 19, 1954 with E. G. Marshall and Eva Marie Saint in Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;Middle of the Night&quot;, a play which relocated to Broadway theaters 15 months later; In 1956, &quot;Middle of the Night&quot; opened on Broadway with Edward G. Robinson and Gena Rowlands, and its success led to a national tour. It was filmed by Columbia Pictures in 1959 with Kim Novak and Fredric March.

=== &quot;Marty&quot; and fame ===
In 1953, Chayefsky wrote &quot;Marty&quot;, which was premiered on &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;, with Rod Steiger and Nancy Marchand. &quot;Marty&quot; is about a decent, hard-working Bronx butcher, pining for the company of a woman in his life but despairing of ever finding true love in a relationship. Fate pairs him with a plain, shy schoolteacher named Clara whom he rescues from the embarrassment of being abandoned by her blind date in a local dance hall. The production, the actors and Chayefsky&#x27;s naturalistic dialogue received much critical acclaim and influenced subsequent live television dramas.

Chayefsky was initially uninterested when producer Harold Hecht sought to buy film rights for &quot;Marty&quot; for Hecht-Hill-Lancaster. Chayefsky, still upset by his treatment years before, demanded creative control, consultation on casting, and the same director as in the TV version, Delbert Mann. Surprisingly, Hecht agreed to all of Chayefsky&#x27;s demands, and named Chayefsky &quot;associate producer&quot; of the film. Chayefsky then requested and was granted &quot;co-director&quot; status, so that he could take over production if Mann were fired.

The screenplay was little changed from the teleplay, but with Clara&#x27;s role expanded. Chayefsky was involved in all casting decisions and had a cameo role, playing one of Marty&#x27;s friends, unseen, in a car. Actress Betsy Blair, playing Clara, faced difficulties because of her affiliation with left-wing causes, and United Artists demanded that she be removed. Chayefsky refused, and her husband Gene Kelly also intervened on her behalf. Blair remained in the cast.

In September 1954, after most of the movie had been filmed, the studio ceased production due to accounting and financial difficulties. Producer Harold Hecht encountered resistance to the &quot;Marty&quot; project from his partner Burt Lancaster from the beginning, with Lancaster &quot;only tolerating&quot; it. The film had a limited publicity budget. But reviews were glowing, and the film won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Picture, greatly boosting Chayefsky&#x27;s career.

=== Late 1950s ===
After his success with &quot;Marty&quot;, Chayefsky continued to write for TV and theater as well as films. Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;The Great American Hoax&quot; was broadcast May 15, 1957 during the second season of &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot;.

His TV play &quot;The Bachelor Party&quot; was bought by United Artists and &quot;The Catered Affair&quot; was acquired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Gore Vidal was hired to write the screenplay by MGM, while Chayefsky wrote the &quot;Bachelor Party&quot;. &quot;Catered Affair&quot; did well in Europe but poorly in U.S. theaters, and was not a success.

&quot;Bachelor Party&quot; was budgeted at $750,000, twice &quot;Marty&quot;, but received far less acclaim and was viewed by United Artists as artistically inferior. The studio chose instead to promote another Hecht-Hill-Lancaster film, &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;, which it believed to be better. &quot;Bachelor Party&quot; was a commercial failure, and never made a profit.

Chayefsky wrote a film adaptation of his Broadway play &quot;Middle of the Night&quot;, originally writing the female lead role for Marilyn Monroe. She passed on the part, which went to Kim Novak. He also commenced work on &quot;The Goddess&quot;, the story of the rise and fall of a movie star resembling Monroe. The star of &quot;The Goddess&quot;, Kim Stanley, despised the film and refused to publicize it. He and Stanley clashed during production of the film, in which Chayefsky served as producer as well as screenwriter. Despite her requests, Chayefsky refused to change any aspect of the script. Monroe&#x27;s husband, Arthur Miller believed that the film was based on his wife&#x27;s life and protested to Chayefsky. The film received positive reviews, and Chayefsky received an Academy Award nomination for his script. A New York Herald Tribune reviewer called the film &quot;a substantial advance in the work of Chayefsky.&quot;

Chayefsky denied for years that the film was based on Monroe, but Chayefsky&#x27;s biographer Shaun Considine observes that not only was she the prototype but the film &quot;captured her longing and despair&quot; accurately.

In 1958 Chayefsky began adapting &quot;Middle of the Night&quot; as a film, and he decided not to use the star of the Broadway version, Edward G. Robinson, with whom he had clashed, choosing instead Frederic March. Elizabeth Taylor initially agreed to appear in the female lead, but dropped out. Kim Novak was ultimately cast in the part. The film was chosen as the American entry at the Cannes Film Festival, but reviews were mixed and the film had only a short run in theaters.

&quot;The Tenth Man&quot; (1959) marked Chayefsky&#x27;s second Broadway theatrical success, garnering 1960 Tony Award nominations for Best Play, Best Director (Tyrone Guthrie) and Best Scenic Design. Guthrie received another nomination for Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;Gideon&quot;, as did actor Fredric March. Chayefsky&#x27;s final Broadway theatrical production, a play based on the life of Joseph Stalin, &quot;The Passion of Josef D&quot;, received unfavorable reviews and ran for only 15 performances.

Although Chayefsky was an early writer for the television medium, he eventually abandoned it, &quot;decrying the lack of interest the networks demonstrated toward quality programming&quot;. As a result, during the course of his career, he constantly toyed with the idea of lampooning the television industry, which he succeeded in doing with &quot;Network&quot;.

=== &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; ===
Although Chayefsky wished only to do original screenplays, he was persuaded by producer Martin Ransohoff to adapt William Bradford Huie&#x27;s 1959 novel that was eventually filmed with the book&#x27;s title &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964). The novel dealt with interservice rivalries prior to the Normandy landings during World War II, with a love story at the center of the plot. Chayefsky agreed to adapting the novel but only if he could fundamentally change the story. He made the titular character more sophisticated, but refusing to be &quot;Americanized&quot; by accepting material goods.

William Wyler was initially brought in as the director, but his relationship with Chayefsky deteriorated when he sought to change the script. William Holden was initially cast in the male lead, but that led to conflict when he asked that Julie Andrews be replaced by his then-girlfriend, Capucine. James Garner, adept at comedy with sophisticated dialogue but originally slated to play a supporting role, replaced Holden and delivered a critically acclaimed performance while James Coburn took over the part originally meant for Garner. Both James Garner and Julie Andrews always maintained that &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; was their favorite film of their own work. The film opened in August 1964 to superlative reviews but was a box office failure, possibly due to its extremely controversial anti-war stance at the dawn of the Vietnam War. The studio changed the title in the middle of its release, calling it &quot;Emily...she&#x27;s super!&quot; to avoid confusing part of the public with a seven-syllable word in the title. The film has since been praised as a &quot;vanguard anti-war film.&quot;

=== 1960s &#x27;fallow period&#x27; ===
The failure of &quot;Americanization of Emily&quot; and &quot;Josef D&quot;. on Broadway shook Chayefsky&#x27;s confidence, and was the beginning of a what his biographer Shaun Considine calls a &quot;fallow period.&quot; He agreed to do novel adaptations, which he had previously shunned, and was hired to adapt the Richard Jessup novel &quot;The Cincinnati Kid.&quot; Director Sam Peckinpah rejected the script, and Chayefsky was fired. Peckinpah was replaced by Norman Jewison shortly after the film began production.

Chayefsky worked for a time on adapting Huie&#x27;s book &quot;Three Lives for Mississippi,&quot; about the murders of three civil rights workers in 1964, and in 1967 was hired to adapt the Broadway musical &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;. He was fired from the film after producing a script that Alan Jay Lerner, the playwright and producer, felt lacked &quot;a musical structure.&quot; Chayefsky had his name removed as screenwriter but remained as adapter.

=== Comeback with &quot;The Hospital&quot; ===
In 1969 and 1970. Chayefsky began to consider a film that would be set among the civil unrest taking place at the time. When his wife Susan received poor care at a hospital, he pitched to United Artists a story based at a hospital. To ensure that he had the same kind of creative control given to playwrights, he formed Simcha Productions, named after the Hebrew version of his given name, Sidney. He then commenced research, reading medical books and visiting hospitals.

The leading character in the film, Dr. Herbert Bock, included many of Chayefsky&#x27;s personal traits. Bock had been a &quot;boy genius&quot; who felt bitter and that his life was over. One of the monologues of George C. Scott as Bock in the film, in which Bock says he is miserable and considering suicide, was repeated verbatim from a conversation that Chayefsky had with a business associate during that time.

The long speeches written for Bock and other characters by Chayefsky, later praised by critics, met resistance from United Artists executives during the making of the film. The script was described as &quot;too talky&quot; and containing excessive medical terminology. But Chayefsky, as producer, prevailed. He also vetoed the studio&#x27;s suggestion that Walter Matthau or Burt Lancaster be hired for the lead role, insisting on Scott. Chayefsky worked on the dialogue with Diana Rigg, the female lead, but Scott rejected his input.

After filming, Chayefsky spoke the opening narration after several actors were rejected for the job. It was supposed to be temporary, but became the one that was used in the film. Although some initial reviews were negative, the film received rave reviews from leading critics, and was a box office hit. Chayefsky won an Academy Award for his script, and his career was revived.

=== &quot;Network&quot; ===
Chayefsky believed that television news desensitized viewers to violence and murder, and he was shocked one day when a respected news anchorman &quot;rattled off inanities.&quot; He asked his friend, the NBC News anchor John Chancellor, if it was possible for an anchorman to go crazy on the air, and Chancellor replied &quot;Every day.&quot; Within a week of that conversation, Chayefsky had written the rough draft of a script, centering on Howard Beale, an elderly, disillusioned anchor who announces he will commit suicide on the air. In 1974, a local news anchor, Christine Chubbuck, committed suicide during a broadcast.

Chayefsky researched the project by watching hours of television and consulting with NBC executive David Tebet, who allowed Chayefsky to attend programming meetings. He later conducted research at CBS and met with Walter Cronkite. The completed script reflected his research and his personal view, prevalent at the time, that Arabs were &quot;buying up&quot; U.S. corporations. The &quot;mad as hell&quot; speech was a deeply personal statement reflecting the core of Chayefsky&#x27;s beliefs during the early 1970s. Chayefsky later called it an easy speech to write, reflecting his view that people had a right to get mad.

The script encountered difficulty because of film industry concerns that it was too tough on television. Ultimately it was decided that the film would be a co-production of MGM and United Artists, with Chayefsky having complete creative control. The deal was announced in July 1975. George C. Scott was offered the supporting role of Max Schumacher (Beale&#x27;s friend and a traditional journalist representing integrity in the media) but rejected it, and the role went to William Holden. Chayefsky refused requests by UA and MGM to give the film a &quot;softer&quot; ending, feeling that the actual ending – with the Howard Beale character assassinated at the order of the network&#x27;s executives – would alienate audiences.

Outside the expected negative reviews from television network film critics, the film was a critical and box office success, winning ten Academy Award nominations, and Chayefsky won his third Academy Award, making him the only three-time solo recipient of a screenwriting Oscar; all the other three-time winners (Francis Ford Coppola, Charles Brackett, Woody Allen, and Billy Wilder) shared at least one of their awards with co-writers. When Peter Finch posthumously won Best Actor for playing Beale, Chayefsky was to accept on his behalf, but he defied the show&#x27;s producer, William Friedkin, and called Finch&#x27;s wife Eletha to the stage to accept the award.

The film is said to have &quot;presaged the advent of reality television by twenty years&quot; and was a &quot;sardonic satire&quot; of the television industry, dealing with the &quot;dehumanization of modern life.&quot;

=== &quot;Altered States&quot; ===
After &quot;Network&quot; Chayefsky explored an offer from Warren Beatty to write a film based on the life of John Reed and his book &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot;. He agreed to do research, and spent three months exploring the subject of what eventually became the Beatty film &quot;Reds&quot;. Negotiations with Beatty&#x27;s lawyers failed.

In the spring of 1977, Chayefsky began work on a project delving into &quot;man&#x27;s search of his true self.&quot; The genesis of the idea was a joke with his friends Bob Fosse and Herb Gardner. The three cooked up a joke project to remake &quot;King Kong&quot;, in which Kong becomes a movie star. The comic project got Chayefsky interested in exploring the origins of the human spirit. That evolved into a project updating the theme of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;.

Chayefsky conducted research on genetic regression, speaking to doctors and professors of anthropology and human genetics. He then began a rough outline of a story in which the lead character immerses himself in an isolation tank, and with the aid of hallucinogens regresses to become a prehuman creature. Chayefsky wrote an eighty-seven page treatment and, at the suggestion of Columbia executive Daniel Melnick, he adapted it into a novel

Film rights were bought by Columbia Pictures for nearly $1 million, and with the same creative control and financial terms as for &quot;Network&quot;. Chayefsky suffered greatly from stress while working on the novel, resulting in a heart attack in 1977. The heart attack resulted in strict dietary and lifestyle restrictions. The novel, titled &quot;Altered States,&quot; was published by HarperCollins in June 1978 and received mixed reviews. Chayefsky did not promote the book, which he viewed only as a blueprint for the screenplay.

Since his contract gave him creative control, Chayefsky participated in the selection of William Hurt and Blair Brown as the leads. Arthur Penn was initially hired as director, but left after disagreements with Chayefsky. He was replaced by Ken Russell.

Chayefsky made it clear that he would allow no input into the dialogue or narrative, which Russell felt was too &quot;soppy.&quot; Russell was confident that he could get rid of Chayefsky, but found that &quot;the monkey on my back was always there and wouldn&#x27;t let go.&quot; Russell was polite and deferential prior to production but after rehearsals began in 1979 &quot;began to treat Paddy as a nonentity&quot; and was &quot;mean and sarcastic,&quot; according to the film&#x27;s producer Howard Gottfried.

Chayefsky had the power to fire Russell, but was told by Gottfried that he could only do so if he took over direction himself. He left for New York and continued to monitor production. The actors were not permitted to alter the dialogue. Chayefsky later said that in retaliation the actors were instructed to speak their lines while eating or talking too fast. Russell stated that the fast pace and overlapping dialogue was Chayefsky&#x27;s idea.

Upset by the filming of his screenplay, Chayefsky withdrew from the production of &quot;Altered States&quot; and took his name off the credits, substituting the pseudonym Sidney Aaron.

==Personality and characteristics==

In his book &quot;Mad as Hell: The Making of Network and the Fateful Vision of the Angriest Man in Movies&quot;, journalist Dave Itzkoff wrote that the Howard Beale character in &quot;Network&quot; was a product of Chayefsky&#x27;s many frustrations. Itzkoff wrote: &quot;Where others avoided conflict, he cultivated it and embraced it. His fury nourished him, making him intense and unpredictable, but also keeping him focused and productive.&quot; Itzkoff describes Chayefsky as &quot;intensely troubled, a huge egomaniac and control freak, dispirited about the world, wryly comic, and a both present and absent family man.&quot;

In his biography of Chayefsky&#x27;s friend Bob Fosse, drama critic Martin Gottfried said Chayefsky was compact and burly in the bulky way of a schoolyard athlete, with thick dark hair and a bent nose that could pass for a streetfighter&#x27;s. He was a grown-up with one foot in the boys&#x27; clubs of his city youth, a street snob who would not allow the loss of his nostalgia. He was an intellectual competitor, always spoiling for a political argument or a philosophical argument, or any exchange over any issue, changing sides for the fun of the fray. A liberal, he was annoyed by liberals; a proud Jew, he wouldn&#x27;t let anyone call him a &quot;Jewish writer&quot;.In his biography &quot;Mad as Hell&quot;, author Shaun Considine says that Chayefsky had a &quot;dual personality&quot;. Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;Paddy&quot; persona had &quot;character, caprice; it appealed to his sense of swagger&quot; and gave him confidence to stand up for his rights. &quot;Sidney&quot; was the &quot;silent creator&quot; who had the talent and genius.

Chayefsky was under psychoanalysis for years, beginning in the late 1950s, to deal with his volatile behavior and rage, which at times was difficult to control.

==Political activism==
===Opposition to McCarthyism===

Early in his career, Chayefsky was an opponent of McCarthyism. He signed a telegram signed by other writers and performers protesting federal inaction after a concert featuring Paul Robeson in Peekskill, New York, prompted violence in which 150 persons were injured. As a result, his name appeared in the anti-Communist vigilante publication &quot;The Firing Line&quot;, published by the American Legion. Although Chayefsky feared being subpoeanaed and his career ruined, that never happened. Actress Betsy Blair described Chayefsky as a Social Democrat and as an anti-Marxist.

He opposed the Vietnam War as a &quot;stupid and utterly unnecessary war whose principal victim would be the United States&quot; and sent a letter to President Richard Nixon decrying the My Lai Massacre, saying Americans were in danger of turning into &quot;a nation of bad Germans.&quot;

===Soviet Jews and Israel===

In the 1970s Chayefsky worked for the cause of Soviet Jews, and in 1971 went to Brussels as part of an U.S. delegation to the International Conference on Soviet Jewry. Believing that the conference was insufficiently aggressive, he founded a new activist organization in New York, Writers and Artists for Peace in the Middle East. Co-founders included Colleen Dewhurst, Frank Gervasi, Leon Uris, Gerold Frank and Elie Wiesel. Chayefsky believed that &quot;Zionists&quot; was a code word for &quot;Jews&quot; by Marxist anti-Semites.

Chayefsky was increasingly interested in Israel at that time. In an interview with &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; in 1971, he said that he believed that Jews around the world were in imminent danger of genocide. Journalist Dave Itzkoff writes that in the 1970s his views on Israel possessed a &quot;more aggressive and admittedly paranoid streak.&quot; He believed that anti-Semitism was rife in the U.S., especially in the New Left, and once physically confronted a heckler who used an anti-Semitic slur during a David Steinberg performance. While filming &quot;The Hospital&quot;, Chayefsky commenced work on a film project called &quot;The Habbakuk Conspiracy,&quot; which he described as a &quot;study of life within an Arab guerrilla cell on the West Bank of the Jordan.&quot; The project was sold to United Artists but never filmed, which resulted in lingering resentment toward the studio.

Chayefsky composed, without credit, pro-Israel ads for the Anti-Defamation League at the time of the Yom Kippur War in 1973. In the late 1970s Writers and Artists for Peace in the Middle East placed full-page newspaper ads written by Chayefsky attacking the Palestine Liberation Organization for the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics.

He rejected Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave for the role of the female lead in &quot;Network&quot; because of what he alleged were their &quot;anti-Israel leanings,&quot; even though Redgrave was director Sidney Lumet&#x27;s first choice. Redgrave, accepting the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for &quot;Julia&quot; at the 1978 Academy Awards, made a statement during her award acceptance speech denouncing protestors who were members of the Jewish Defense League (JDL), led by Rabbi Meir Kahane, who burned an effigy of Redgrave outside the Awards site, picketed the Academy Awards ceremony to protest against her, and had earlier called on 20th Century Fox to denounce Redgrave and promise never to hire her again, saying, &quot;You should be very proud that in the last few weeks you have stood firm and you have refused to be intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums whose behavior is an insult to the stature of Jews all over the world, and to their great and heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression.&quot; Chayefsky, appearing later, upbraided Redgrave and said &quot;a simple &#x27;Thank you&#x27; would have sufficed.&quot; The Redgrave and Chayefsky remarks prompted controversy.

==Family==
Chayefsky met his future wife Susan Sackler during his 1940s stay in Hollywood. The couple married in February 1949. Their son Dan was born in 1955.

Chayefsky&#x27;s relationship with his wife was strained for much of their marriage, and she became withdrawn and unwilling to appear with him as he became more prominent. Gwen Verdon, wife of his friend Bob Fosse, only saw Susan Chayefsky five times in her life.

Susan Chayefsky suffered from muscular dystrophy, and Dan Chayefsky described himself to author Dave Itzkoff as &quot;a self-destructive teen who brought more pressure to the family home.&quot; Despite an alleged affair with Kim Novak, which resulted in his asking his wife for a divorce, Paddy Chayefsky remained married to Susan Chayefsky until his death, and sought her opinion on his screenplays, including &quot;Network&quot;. She died in 2000.

==Death==

Chayefsky contracted pleurisy in 1980 and again in 1981. Tests revealed cancer, but he refused surgery out of fear that surgeons would &quot;cut me up because of that movie I wrote about them,&quot; referring to &quot;The Hospital&quot;. He opted for chemotherapy. He died in a New York hospital on August 1, 1981, aged 58, and was interred in the Sharon Gardens Division of Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, Westchester County, New York.

Longtime friend Bob Fosse performed a tap dance at the funeral, as part of a deal he and Chayefsky had made when Fosse was in the hospital for open-heart surgery. If Fosse died first, Chayefsky promised to deliver a tedious eulogy or Fosse would dance at Chayefsky&#x27;s memorial if he were the one to die first. Fosse would dedicate his final film &quot;Star 80&quot; to Chayefsky in 1983. Chayefsky&#x27;s personal papers are at the Wisconsin Historical Society and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Billy Rose Theatre Division.

<text>The Vanishing (, literally: &quot;Traceless&quot; or &quot;Without a Trace&quot;) is a 1988 psychological thriller film directed by George Sluizer, adapted from the novella &quot;The Golden Egg&quot; (1984) by Tim Krabbé. It stars Gene Bervoets as a man who searches obsessively for his girlfriend following her disappearance at a rest area. &quot;The Vanishing&quot; was released on 27 October 1988, and received positive reviews. Sluizer remade the film in English in 1993.

==Plot==
A young Dutch couple, Rex and Saskia, are on holiday in France. As they drive, Saskia shares a recurring dream in which she is drifting through space in a golden egg. In the most recent dream, another egg containing another person appeared; she feels the collision of the two eggs would signify the end of something.

Their car runs out of petrol and they stop at a rest area. Rex promises to never abandon Saskia and they bury two coins at the base of a tree as a symbol of their romance. Saskia enters the petrol station to buy drinks and does not return. Rex frantically searches for her.

Some time earlier, Raymond, a wealthy family man, secretly plots to abduct a woman. He buys an isolated house, experiments with chloroform, and rehearses methods of enticing women into his car. When his initial attempts at abduction fail, he poses as an injured motorist in need of assistance and goes to the rest area out of town, where he will not be recognised.

Three years after Saskia&#x27;s disappearance, Rex is still searching for her. He has received several postcards inviting him to meet the kidnapper at a cafe in Nîmes, but the kidnapper never comes. Unknown to Rex, the cafe is directly opposite Raymond&#x27;s apartment, where he watches Rex wait. Rex&#x27;s new girlfriend, Lieneke, reluctantly helps him search for Saskia. One day, Rex has a dream similar to Saskia&#x27;s in which he is trapped in a golden egg. Unable to endure his obsession, Lieneke leaves him.

Rex makes a public appeal on television, saying he only wants to know the truth about what happened to Saskia. Raymond confronts Rex and admits to the kidnapping; he says he will reveal what happened to her if Rex comes with him. As they drive, Raymond says he has known from a young age that he has no conscience, and is therefore capable of anything. After saving a young girl from drowning, he resolved to commit the worst crime he could imagine in order to test if he was worthy of his daughter&#x27;s admiration; in his view, one can only be a truly good person if one is capable of doing something evil, but chooses not to do it. He describes how he kidnapped Saskia at the rest stop by posing as a traveling salesman and enticing her into his car.

Raymond takes Rex to the rest area. He dismisses Rex&#x27;s threats of police action, saying there is no evidence connecting him to the crime. Pouring a cup of drugged coffee, Raymond tells Rex the only way to learn what happened to Saskia is to experience it himself. As Raymond waits in the car, Rex rages, unsure of what to do. After digging up the coins he and Saskia buried years earlier, he drinks the coffee and awakens buried in a box underground.

Raymond relaxes at his country home, surrounded by his wife and children. A newspaper sitting in his car features a headline about the double disappearance of Saskia and Rex, with their portraits in two egg-shaped ovals.

===Writing===
Before working on &quot;The Vanishing&quot;, Sluizer became familiar with journalist Tim Krabbé through his articles about filmmaking in the United States. These articles eventually became a novel, which Sluizer adapted into his film &quot;Red Desert Penitentiary&quot; (1985). After &quot;Red Desert Penitentiary&quot;, Krabbé began writing a novel called &quot;Het Gouden Ei&quot; ( &quot;The Golden Egg&quot;). As the film was set in France, Krabbé asked Sluizer about names of towns, and Sluizer advised him on town names as well as family names. Sluizer had access to the early manuscripts of the novel, and after reading the first few chapters he stated that he wanted to buy the film rights.

Krabbé initially offered to write the script for Sluizer after he had finished the book. Sluizer described the script&#x27;s first draft as &quot;not bad, but not good&quot; and wrote the second draft with Krabbé. The two worked on a third draft together, and Sluizer stated they began to have what he described as a &quot;difference of opinion&quot; over what should happen in the film, the placing of scenes, and how to dramatically tell the story. Sluizer stopped working with Krabbé, stating that he had bought the film rights and he would finish the script himself, which angered Krabbé. The completed film accurately portrays the narrative within the novel, apart from two factors: first, the film&#x27;s narrative is more complicated than that of the novel, making extensive use of flashbacks and gradually revealing personality traits of the central characters; and, second, Rex and Raymond spend more time together following their meeting in the film than they do in the novel.

===Casting===
A casting agent suggested Sluizer see Johanna ter Steege, who was in a student play, for the role of Saskia Wagter. When Sluizer saw that Steege&#x27;s hair was a similar color to his daughter&#x27;s, he decided she would be right for the character.

For the role of Rex, there was a choice between two actors: a Dutch actor and Belgian actor Gene Bervoets. Sluizer chose Bervoets because his French was stronger, but later felt unsure he had chosen the right actor, which led him to have a slightly uncomfortable relationship with Bervoets on set.

Jean-Louis Trintignant was Sluizer&#x27;s initial choice for the role of Raymond Lemorne, but he was unavailable. After thinking about other French actors who could play the part, Sluizer thought of Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, who had a small role in his film &quot;Twice a Woman&quot; (1979). Sluizer discovered Donnadieu had worked in television and had leading roles in films since appearing in &quot;Twice a Woman&quot; and got him signed to play Raymond.

==Release==

&quot;The Vanishing&quot; was released in the Netherlands on 27 October 1988. It was the Dutch submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1988, but was disqualified because the Academy determined there was too much French dialogue for it to represent the Netherlands. The Dutch declined to send another film, leaving them unrepresented among the foreign submissions for the first time since 1972.

Producers George Sluizer and Anne Lordon received the Golden Calf for Best Feature Film at the Netherlands Film Festival in 1988. Johanna ter Steege won a European Film Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1988.

The film was released in France on 20 December 1989 under the title &quot;L&#x27;Homme Qui Voulait Savoir&quot; ().

===Home media===
The first North American copies of &quot;The Vanishing&quot; were released on Laserdisc by Image Entertainment on 3 November 1997. It was later released on VHS by Fox Lorber on 11 November 1997, followed by a DVD release on 13 May 1998.

The Criterion Collection released a DVD of the film on 18 September 2001. This release contains the original French trailer and an essay on the film by film critic Kim Newman as supplemental material. Criterion released the film on Blu-ray and DVD on 28 October 2014, this time with the original French trailer, interviews with Sluizer and Johanna ter Steege, and an essay by Scott Foundas as supplements.

Under the supervision of EYE Film Institute Netherlands, the film was restored. This version was released on DVD as part of the George Sluizer &quot;Collected Works&quot; in 2019 and online in 2021.

===Radio play===
In 2010, the film was adapted for radio by Oliver Emanuel and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as part of the station&#x27;s Saturday Drama slot. Directed by Kirsty Williams, it starred Samuel West, Melody Grove and Ruth Gemmell. It has since been repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra.

==Reception==
On the review database Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Vanishing&quot; has a 96% approval rating based on 51 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A clinical, maddening descent into the mind of a serial killer and a slowly unraveling hero, culminating with one of the scariest endings of all time.&quot;

&quot;The Vanishing&quot; received international praise at the time of its release. It was released in the United States in 1991 and made the National Board of Review&#x27;s list of the Top Foreign Films of 1991. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film&#x27;s avoidance of cliches, noting that it is &quot;refreshingly free of manipulative scenes involving running bath water, jagged-edge cutlery and bunnies in the saucepan&quot;. Howe also made note of the unusual move of revealing the kidnapper immediately and spending significant time learning about him. 

Roger Ebert wrote in the &quot;Chicago Sun Times:&quot; &quot;One of the most intriguing things about &quot;The Vanishing&quot; is the film&#x27;s unusual structure, which builds suspense even while it seems to be telling us almost everything we want to know.&quot; Stanley Kubrick thought &quot;The Vanishing&quot; was the most terrifying film he had seen and called Sluizer to discuss editing. &quot;Cadd&quot; of &quot;Variety&quot; declared the film &quot;the ultimate tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, daring to offer up an ending that goes beyond even the master&#x27;s memorable climaxes&quot;. Dave Kehr, writing in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, said &quot;It&#x27;s a film that functions on curiosity rather than real interest ... yet in the end punishes the audience for wanting to have its questions answered.&quot; In 2010, &quot;Empire&quot; named &quot;The Vanishing&quot; the 67th-best &quot;world cinema&quot; film.

<doc id="350586" wikidata="Q313498" url="?curid=350586" title="Benjamin West">
<text>Benjamin West (October 10, 1738 – March 11, 1820) was a British-American artist who painted famous historical scenes such as &quot;The Death of Nelson&quot;, &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot;, the &quot;Treaty of Paris&quot;, and &quot;Benjamin Franklin Drawing Electricity from the Sky&quot;.

Entirely self-taught, West soon gained valuable patronage and toured Europe, eventually settling in London. He impressed King George III and was largely responsible for the launch of the Royal Academy, of which he became the second president (after Sir Joshua Reynolds). He was appointed historical painter to the court and Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Pictures.

West also painted religious subjects, as in his huge work &quot;The Preservation of St Paul after a Shipwreck at Malta&quot;, at the Chapel of St Peter and St Paul at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, and &quot;Christ Healing the Sick&quot;, presented to the National Gallery.

==Early life==
West was born in Springfield, Pennsylvania, in a house that is now in the borough of Swarthmore on the campus of Swarthmore College. He was the tenth child of an innkeeper, John West (1690–1776), and his wife, Sarah Pearson (1697–1756). The family later moved to Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where his father was the proprietor of the Square Tavern, still standing in that town.

West told the novelist John Galt, with whom, late in his life, he collaborated on a memoir, &quot;The Life and Studies of Benjamin West&quot; (1816, 1820), that, when he was a child, Native Americans showed him how to make paint by mixing some clay from the river bank with bear grease in a pot. West was an autodidact; while excelling at the arts, &quot;he had little [formal] education and, even when president of the Royal Academy, could scarcely spell&quot;. One day, his mother left him alone with his little sister Sally. Benjamin discovered some bottles of ink and began to paint Sally&#x27;s portrait. When his mother came home, she noticed the painting, picked it up and said, &quot;Why, it&#x27;s Sally!&quot;, and kissed him. Later, he noted, &quot;My mother&#x27;s kiss made me a painter&quot;. He received further art training by the artisan painter William Williams.

From 1746 to 1759, West worked in Pennsylvania, mostly painting portraits. While West was in Lancaster in 1756, his patron, a gunsmith named William Henry, encouraged him to paint a &quot;Death of Socrates&quot; based on an engraving in Charles Rollin&#x27;s &quot;Ancient History.&quot; His resulting composition, which significantly differs from the source, has been called &quot;the most ambitious and interesting painting produced in colonial America&quot;. Dr William Smith, then the provost of the College of Philadelphia, saw the painting in Henry&#x27;s house and decided to become West&#x27;s patron, offering him education and, more importantly, connections with wealthy and politically connected Pennsylvanians. During this time West met John Wollaston, a famous painter who had immigrated from London. West learned Wollaston&#x27;s techniques for painting the shimmer of silk and satin, and also adopted some of &quot;his mannerisms, the most prominent of which was to give all his subjects large almond-shaped eyes, which clients thought very chic&quot;.

West was a close friend of Benjamin Franklin, whose portrait he painted. Franklin was the godfather of West&#x27;s second son, Benjamin.

==Italian tour==
Sponsored by Smith and William Allen, then reputed to be the wealthiest man in Philadelphia, West traveled to Italy in 1760 in the company of the Scot William Patoun, a painter who later became an art collector. In common with many artists, architects, and lovers of the fine arts at that time he conducted a Grand Tour. West expanded his repertoire by copying works of Italian painters such as Titian and Raphael direct from the originals.
In Rome he met a number of international neo-classical artists including German-born Anton Rafael Mengs, Scottish Gavin Hamilton, and Austrian Angelica Kauffman.

==England==
In August 1763, West arrived in England, on what he initially intended as a visit on his way back to America. In fact, he never returned to America. He stayed for a month at Bath with William Allen, who was also in the country, and visited his half-brother Thomas West at Reading at the urging of his father. In London he was introduced to Richard Wilson and his student Joshua Reynolds. He moved into a house in Bedford Street, Covent Garden. The first picture he painted in England, &quot;Angelica and Medora&quot;, along with the &quot;Portrait of Robert Monckton&quot;, and his &quot;Cymon and Iphigenia&quot;, painted in Rome, were shown at the exhibition Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1764.

In 1765, he married Elizabeth Shewell, an American he engaged in Philadelphia, at St Martin-in-the-Fields.

Dr Markham, then Headmaster of Westminster School, introduced West to Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke, Thomas Newton, Bishop of Bristol, James Johnson, Bishop of Worcester, and Robert Hay Drummond, Archbishop of York. All three prelates commissioned work from him. In 1766 West proposed a scheme to decorate St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with paintings. It was rejected by the Bishop of London, but his idea of painting an altarpiece for St Stephen Walbrook was accepted. At around this time he also received acclaim for his classical subjects, such as &quot;Orestes and Pylades&quot; and &quot;The Continence of Scipio&quot;.

West was known in England as the &quot;American Raphael&quot;. His Raphaelesque painting of &quot;Archangel Michael Binding the Devil&quot; is in the collection of Trinity College, Cambridge. He said that &quot;Art is the representation of human beauty, ideally perfect in design, graceful and noble in attitude.&quot;

===Royal patronage===
Drummond tried to raise subscriptions to fund an annuity for West, so that he could give up portraiture and devote himself entirely to more ambitious compositions. Having failed in this, he tried—with greater success—to convince King George III to patronise West. West was soon on good terms with the king, and the two men conducted long discussions on the state of art in England, including the idea of the establishment of a Royal Academy. The academy came into being in 1768, with West one of the primary leaders of an opposition group formed out of the existing Society of Artists of Great Britain; Joshua Reynolds was its first president. In the same year, he was elected to membership in the American Philosophical Society. In a story related by Henry Angelo I (1756–1835) in his book of reminiscences, the actor David Garrick, who was a friend of Angelo&#x27;s father, the Italian sword master Domenico Angelo, memorably sketched for the teenaged Henry the following exchange: one day the painter Francesco Zuccarelli, on one of his visits to Domenico, got into a dispute with his fellow royal academician Johan Zoffany about the merit of West&#x27;s 1769 painting &quot;The Departure of Regulus&quot;, his first commission for the king. Zuccarelli exclaimed, &quot;Here is a painter who promises to rival Nicolas Poussin&quot;, while Zoffany tauntingly replied, &quot;A figo for Poussin, West has already beaten him out of the field.&quot;

In 1772, King George appointed him historical painter to the court at an annual fee of £1,000. He painted a series of eight large canvases showing episodes from the life of Edward III for St George&#x27;s Hall at Windsor Castle, and proposed a cycle of 36 works on the theme of &quot;the progress of revealed religion&quot; for a chapel at the castle, of which 28 were eventually executed. The largest group of paintings (seven) from the series is currently in Greenville, SC. He also painted nine portraits of members of the royal family, including two of the king himself. He was Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Pictures from 1791 until his death.

===&quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot;===

West painted his most famous, and possibly most influential painting, &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot;, in 1770 and it exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1771. The painting became one of the most frequently reproduced images of the period. It returned to the French and Indian War setting of his &quot;General Johnson Saving a Wounded French Officer from the Tomahawk of a North American Indian&quot; of 1768. When the American Revolution broke out in 1775 he remained ambivalent, and neither spoke out for or against the Revolutionary War in his land of birth.

West became known for his large scale history paintings, which use expressive figures, colours and compositional schemes to help the spectator to identify with the scene represented. West called this &quot;epic representation&quot;. His 1778 work &quot;The Battle of the Boyne&quot; portrayed William of Orange&#x27;s victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and strongly influenced subsequent images of William. In 1806 he produced &quot;The Death of Nelson&quot;, to commemorate Horatio Nelson&#x27;s death at the Battle of Trafalgar.

===Later religious painting===
St Paul&#x27;s Church, in the Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham, has an important enamelled stained glass east window made in 1791 by Francis Eginton, modelled on an altarpiece painted by West, now in the Dallas Museum of Art. It shows the Conversion of Paul. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1791.

West is also well known for his huge work in the Chapel of St Peter and St Paul which now forms part of the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, London. His work, &quot;The Preservation of St Paul after a Shipwreck at Malta&quot;, measures and illustrates the Acts of the Apostles: 27 &amp; 28. West also provided the designs for the other paintings executed by Biagio Rebecca in the chapel.

Following a loss of royal patronage at the beginning of the 19th century, West began a series of large-scale religious works. The first, &quot;Christ Healing the Sick&quot; was originally intended as a gift to Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia; instead he sold it to the British Institution for £3,000, which in turn presented it to the National Gallery. West then made a copy to send to Philadelphia. The success of the picture led him to paint a series of even larger works, including his &quot;Death on the Pale Horse&quot;, exhibited in 1817.

===Royal Academy===

Though initially snubbed by Sir Joshua Reynolds, founding President of the Royal Academy, and by some other Academicians who felt he was over-ambitious, West was elected President of the Royal Academy on the death of Reynolds in 1792. During his time as President, he fell victim to the Venetian secret, a scandal involving a supposedly secret set of materials and techniques used by Renaissance painters in Venice. He resigned in 1805, to be replaced by a fierce rival, architect James Wyatt. However West was again elected president the following year, and served until his death. In 1810 West was painted by his future successor Thomas Lawrence as President of the Royal Academy and the &quot;Portrait of Benjamin West&quot; was exhibited at the 1811 Summer Exhibition.

===Pupils===
Many American artists studied under him in London, including Ralph Earl and later his son, Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl, Samuel Morse, Robert Fulton, Charles Willson Peale, Rembrandt Peale, Matthew Pratt, Gilbert Stuart, John Trumbull, Samuel Lovett Waldo, Washington Allston, Thomas Sully, John Green, and Abraham Delanoy.

===Death===
West died at his house in Newman Street in London, on March 11, 1820, and was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He had been offered a knighthood by the British Crown, but declined it, believing that he should instead be made a peer.

<text>Eurybiades (; ) was the Spartan navarch in charge of the Greek navy during the Second Persian invasion of Greece (480–479 BC).

==Biography==
Eurybiades was the son of Eurycleides, and was chosen as commander in 480 BC because the Peloponnesian city-states led by Sparta, worried about the growing power of Athens, Greece as a whole did not want to serve under an Athenian despite the Athenians&#x27; superior naval skill. For all the enmity between the two, Eurybiades was ultimately assisted by the Athenian naval commander Themistocles.

His first act as commander was to sail the fleet to Artemisium, north of Euboea, to meet the Persian fleet. When they arrived the Greeks found that the Persians were already there, and Eurybiades ordered a retreat, although the Euboeans begged him to stay. Instead, they bribed Themistocles to keep the fleet there, and Themistocles used some of his bribe to pay off Eurybiades (at least according to Herodotus). The subsequent Battle of Artemisium was indecisive, and the Greeks removed their fleet to Salamis Island.

Initially at Salamis, Eurybiades wanted to move the fleet to the Isthmus of Corinth, where the armies of the Hellenic League were building fortifications. Themistocles saw the benefits of fighting at Salamis and wanted to force a naval battle there. Eurybiades was insistent, and Themistocles had to threaten to withdraw the Athenian fleet (the largest contingent of the Greek forces) in order to make Eurybiades stay. After Themistocles tricked the Persian king Xerxes into separating his fleet by sending part around the island to blockade the Greek fleet in the Straits of Salamis, Eurybiades was forced to accept Salamis as the battlefield. The Battle of Salamis was a decisive victory for the Greeks. After the battle Eurybiades was opposed to chasing the Persian fleet, and also to sailing towards the Hellespont to destroy the bridge of ships that Xerxes had built there. He wanted Xerxes to be able to escape rather than have him remain in Greece where he would possibly renew the land war.

Back in Sparta Eurybiades was rewarded with an olive wreath for his success at Salamis; Themistocles was given a similar reward.

<doc id="350589" wikidata="Q40574" url="?curid=350589" title="Lot (biblical person)">
<text>Lot (; &quot;Lōṭ&quot;, lit. &quot;veil&quot; or &quot;covering&quot;; &quot;Lṓt&quot;; &quot;Lūṭ&quot;; Syriac: ܠܘܛ &quot;Lōṭ&quot;) was a man mentioned in the biblical Book of Genesis, chapters 11–14 and 19. Notable events in his life recorded in Genesis include his journey with his uncle Abraham; his flight from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, during which his wife became a pillar of salt, and being intoxicated by his daughters so they could have incestuous intercourse with him to continue their family line.

==Biblical account==
According to the Hebrew Bible, Lot was born to Haran, who died in Ur of the Chaldees. Terah, Lot&#x27;s grandfather, took Abram (later called Abraham), Lot, and Sarai (later called Sarah) to go into Canaan. They settled at the site called Haran, where Terah died.

As a part of the covenant of the pieces, God told Abram to leave his country and his kindred. Abram&#x27;s nephew Lot joined him on his journey and they went into the land of Canaan, settling in the hills of Bethel.

Due to famine, Abram and Lot journeyed into Egypt, but Abram pretended that his wife Sarai was his sister. Hearing of her beauty, the Pharaoh took Sarai for his own, for which God afflicted him with great plagues. When the Pharaoh confronted Abram, Abram admitted that Sarai had been his wife all along, and so the Pharaoh forced them out of Egypt.

=== The plain of Jordan===
When Abram and Lot returned to the hills of Bethel with their many livestock, their respective herdsmen began to bicker. Abram suggested they part ways and let Lot decide where he would like to settle. Lot saw that the plains of the Jordan were well watered &quot;like the gardens of the Lord, like the land of Egypt,&quot; and so settled among the cities of the plain, going as far as Sodom. Likewise, Abram went to dwell in Hebron, staying in the land of Canaan.
The five kingdoms of the plain had become vassal states of an alliance of four eastern kingdoms under the leadership of Chedorlaomer, king of Elam. They served this king for twelve years, but &quot;in the thirteenth year they rebelled.&quot; The following year Chedorlaomer&#x27;s four armies returned and at the Battle of Siddim the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fell in defeat. Chedorlaomer despoiled the cities and took captives as he departed, including Lot, who dwelt in Sodom.

When Abram heard what had happened to Lot, he led a force of three hundred and eighteen of his trained men and caught up to the armies of the four kings in Dan. Abram divided his forces and pursued them to Hobah. Abram brought back Lot and all of his people and their belongings.

=== Sodom ===
Later, after God had changed Abram&#x27;s name to Abraham and Sarai&#x27;s name to Sarah as part of the covenant of the pieces, God appeared to Abraham in the form of three angels. God promised Abraham that Sarah would bear a son and he would become a great and mighty nation. God then tells Abraham his plan,

As the angels continued to walk toward Sodom, Abraham pled to God on behalf of the people of Sodom, where Lot dwelt. God assured him that the city would not be destroyed if fifty righteous people were found there. He continued inquiring, reducing the minimum number for sparing the city to forty five, forty, thirty, twenty, and finally, ten.

===Lot&#x27;s visitors===

After supper, that night before bedtime, the men of the city, young and old, gathered around Lot&#x27;s house demanding that he bring out his two guests that they may rape them. Lot went out, closing the door behind him, and begged them to refrain from so wicked a deed, offering them instead his virgin daughters to do with as they pleased. The men of Sodom accused Lot of acting as a judge and threatened to do worse to him than they would have done to the ‘men’.

The angels drew Lot back in to his house and struck the mob with blindness. The angels then said that God had sent them to destroy the place, telling Lot, &quot;whomsoever thou hast in the city; bring them out of the place&quot;. Lot went to the houses of his sons-in-law and warned them to leave the city, but they would not come, imagining that he spoke only in jest.
Lot lingered in the morning so the angels forced him and his family out of the city, telling them to flee for the hills and not look back. Fearful that the hills would not afford them sufficient protection from the impending destruction, Lot instead asked the angels if he and his might hide in the safety of a neighboring village. An angel agreed and the village was thenceforth known as Zoar. When God rained fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot&#x27;s wife looked back at the burning cities of the plain and was turned into a pillar of salt in recompense for her folly.

Instead of fire and brimstone, Josephus has only lightning as the cause of the fire that destroyed Sodom: &quot;God then cast a thunderbolt upon the city, and set it on fire, with its inhabitants; and laid waste the country with the like burning.&quot; In &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, he likewise says that the city was &quot;burnt by lightning&quot;.

===Daughters===
After the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar and so he and his two daughters resettled into the hills, living in a cave. Concerned for their father having descendants, one evening, Lot&#x27;s eldest daughter gets Lot drunk and has sex with him without his knowledge. The elder daughter then insisted that her younger sister also get their father, Lot, drunk and have sex with him, which the younger sister duly did on the following night. From these incestuous unions, the older daughter conceived Moab (Hebrew מוֹאָב, lit., &quot;from the father&quot; [meh-Av]), father of the Moabites; while the younger conceived Ben-Ammi (Hebrew בֶּן-עַמִּי, lit., &quot;Son of my people&quot;), father of the Ammonites.

The story, usually called Lot and his daughters, has been the subject of many paintings over the centuries, and became one of the subjects in the Power of Women group of subjects, warning men against the dangers of succumbing to the temptations of women, while also providing an opportunity for an erotic depiction. The scene generally shows Lot and his daughters eating and drinking in their mountain refuge. Often the background contains a small figure of Lot&#x27;s wife, and in the distance, a burning city.

Along with the account of Tamar and Judah (Genesis 38:11–26), this is one instance of &quot;sperm stealing&quot; in the Bible, in which a woman seduces and has sex with her male relative under false pretenses in order to become pregnant. Each case involves a direct ancestor of King David.

==Religious views==

===Jewish view===
In the Bereshith of the Torah, Lot is first mentioned at the end of the weekly reading portion, Parashat Noach. The weekly reading portions that follow, concerning all of the accounts of Lot&#x27;s life, are read in the Parashat Lekh Lekha and Parashat Vayera. In the Midrash, a number of additional stories concerning Lot are present, not found in the Tanakh, as follows:
* Abraham took care of Lot after Haran was burned in a gigantic fire in which Nimrod, King of Babylon, tried to kill Abraham.
* While in Egypt, the midrash gives Lot much credit because, despite his desire for wealth, he did not inform Pharaoh of Sarah&#x27;s secret, that she was Abraham&#x27;s wife.
*According to the Book of Jasher, Paltith, one of Lot&#x27;s daughters, was burnt alive (in some versions, on a pyre) for giving a poor man bread. Her cries went to the heavens.

===Christian view===
In the Christian New Testament, Lot is considered sympathetically, as a man who regretted his choice to live in Sodom, where he &quot;vexed his righteous soul from day to day&quot;. Jesus spoke of future judgment coming suddenly as in the days of Lot, and warned solemnly, &quot;Remember Lot&#x27;s wife&quot;.

=== Islamic view===

Lut (Arabic: لُوط – &quot;Lūṭ&quot;) in the Quran is considered to be the same as Lot in the Hebrew Bible. He is considered to be a messenger of God and a prophet of God.

In Islamic tradition, Lut lived in Ur and was a nephew of Ibrahim (Abraham). He migrated with Ibrahim to Canaan and was commissioned as a prophet to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. His story is used as a reference by Muslims to demonstrate God&#x27;s disapproval of homosexuality. He was commanded by God to go to the land of Sodom and Gomorrah to preach monotheism and to stop them from their lustful and violent acts. Lut&#x27;s messages were ignored by the inhabitants, prompting Sodom and Gomorrah&#x27;s destruction. Though Lut left the city, his wife was asked to be left behind by angels hence died during the destruction.
The Quran defines Lot as a prophet, and holds that all prophets were examples of moral and spiritual rectitude.

== 20th-century views ==

The presumptive incest between Lot and his daughters has raised many questions, debates, and theories as to what the real motives were, who really was at fault, and the level of bias the author of Genesis Chapter 19 had. However, such biblical scholars as Jacob Milgrom, Victor P. Hamilton, and Calum Carmichael postulate that the Levitical laws could not have been developed the way they were, without controversial issues surrounding the patriarchs of Israel, especially regarding incest. Carmichael even attributes the entire formulation of the Levitical laws to the lives of the founding fathers of the nation, including the righteous Lot (together with Abraham, Jacob, Judah, Moses, and David), who were outstanding figures in Israelite tradition.

According to the scholars mentioned above, the patriarchs of Israel are the key to understanding how the priestly laws concerning incest developed. Kinship marriages amongst the patriarchs include Abraham&#x27;s marriage to his half-sister Sarai; the marriage of Abraham&#x27;s brother, Nahor, to their niece Milcah; Isaac&#x27;s marriage to Rebekah, his first cousin once removed; Jacob&#x27;s marriages with two sisters who are his first cousins; and, in the instance of Moses&#x27;s parents, a marriage between nephew and paternal aunt. Therefore, the patriarchal marriages surely mattered to lawgivers and they suggest a narrative basis for the laws of Leviticus, chapters 18 and 20.

Some have argued that Lot&#x27;s behavior in offering of his daughters to the men of Sodom in Genesis 19:8 constitutes sexual abuse of his daughters, which created a confusion of kinship roles that was ultimately played out through the incestuous acts in Genesis 19:30–38.

A number of commentators describe the actions of Lot&#x27;s daughters as rape. Esther Fuchs suggests that the text presents Lot&#x27;s daughters as the &quot;initiators and perpetrators of the incestuous &#x27;rape&#x27;.&quot;

<text>The Galton–Watson process is a branching stochastic process arising from Francis Galton&#x27;s statistical investigation of the extinction of family names. The process models family names as patrilineal (passed from father to son), while offspring are randomly either male or female, and names become extinct if the family name line dies out (holders of the family name die without male descendants). 

==History==
There was concern amongst the Victorians that aristocratic surnames were becoming extinct.

In 1869, Galton published &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot;, in which he treated the extinction of different social groups.

Galton originally posed a mathematical question regarding the distribution of surnames in an idealized population in an 1873 issue of &quot;The Educational Times:&quot;A large nation, of whom we will only concern ourselves with adult males, &quot;N&quot; in number, and who each bear separate surnames colonise a district. Their law of population is such that, in each generation, &quot;a&quot;0 per cent of the adult males have no male children who reach adult life; &quot;a&quot;1 have one such male child; &quot;a&quot;2 have two; and so on up to &quot;a&quot;5 who have five. Find what proportion of their surnames will have become extinct after &quot;r&quot; generations; and how many instances there will be of the surname being held by &quot;m&quot; persons.The Reverend Henry William Watson replied with a solution. Together, they then wrote an 1874 paper titled &quot;On the probability of the extinction of families&quot; in the &quot;Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; (now the &quot;Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute&quot;). Galton and Watson appear to have derived their process independently of the earlier work by I. J. Bienaymé; see. Their solution is incomplete, according to which &quot;all&quot; family names go extinct with probability 1.

Bienaymé published the answer to the problem in 1845, with a promise to publish the derivation later, however there is no known publication of his solution. (However, Bru (1991) purports to reconstruct the proof). He was inspired by Émile Littré and Louis-François Benoiston de Châteauneuf (a friend of Bienaymé).

Cournot published a solution in 1847, in chapter 36 of De l&#x27;origine et des limites de la correspondance entre l&#x27;algèbre et la géométrie. The problem in his formulation is

: Consider a gambler who buys lotteries. Each lottery costs 1 ecu and pays formula_1 with probabilities formula_2. The gambler always spends all their money to buy lotteries. If the gambler starts with formula_3 dollars, what&#x27;s the probability of going bankrupt?
Ronald A. Fisher in 1922 studied the same problem formulated in terms of genetics. Instead of the extinction of family names, he studied the probability for a mutant gene to eventually disappear in a large population. Haldane solved the problem in 1927.

Agner Krarup Erlang was a member of the prominent Krarup family, which was going extinct. In 1929, he published the same problem posthumously (his obituary appears beside the problem). Erlang died childless. Steffensen solved it in 1930.

For a detailed history, see Kendall (1966 and 1975) and and also Section 17 of.

== Concepts ==

Assume, for the sake of the model, that surnames are passed on to all male children by their father. Suppose the number of a man&#x27;s sons to be a random variable distributed on the set { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }. Further suppose the numbers of different men&#x27;s sons to be independent random variables, all having the same distribution.

Then the simplest substantial mathematical conclusion is that if the average number of a man&#x27;s sons is 1 or less, then their surname will almost surely die out, and if it is more than 1, then there is more than zero probability that it will survive for any given number of generations.

A corollary of high extinction probabilities is that if a lineage &quot;has&quot; survived, it is likely to have experienced, purely by chance, an unusually high growth rate in its early generations at least when compared to the rest of the population.

== Mathematical definition ==

A Galton–Watson process is a stochastic process {&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;} which evolves according to the recurrence formula &quot;X&quot;0 = 1 and

:formula_4

where formula_5 is a set of independent and identically-distributed natural number-valued random variables.

In the analogy with family names, &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; can be thought of as the number of descendants (along the male line) in the &quot;n&quot;th generation, and formula_6 can be thought of as the number of (male) children of the &quot;j&quot;th of these descendants. The recurrence relation states that the number of descendants in the &quot;n&quot;+1st generation is the sum, over all &quot;n&quot;th generation descendants, of the number of children of that descendant.

The extinction probability (i.e. the probability of final extinction) is given by

:formula_7

This is clearly equal to zero if each member of the population has exactly one descendant. Excluding this case (usually called the trivial case) there exists
a simple necessary and sufficient condition, which is given in the next section.

==Extinction criterion for Galton–Watson process==
In the non-trivial case, the probability of final extinction is equal to 1 if &quot;E&quot;{&quot;ξ&quot;1} ≤ 1 and strictly less than 1 if &quot;E&quot;{&quot;ξ&quot;1} &gt; 1.

The process can be treated analytically using the method of probability generating functions.

If the number of children &quot;ξ j&quot; at each node follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ, a particularly simple recurrence can be found for the total extinction probability &quot;xn&quot; for a process starting with a single individual at time &quot;n&quot; = 0:

:formula_8

giving the above curves.

== Bisexual Galton–Watson process ==

In the classical family surname Galton–Watson process described above, only men need to be considered, since only males transmit their family name to descendants. This effectively means that reproduction can be modeled as asexual. (Likewise, if mitochondrial transmission is analyzed, only women need to be considered, since only females transmit their mitochondria to descendants.)

A model more closely following actual sexual reproduction is the so-called &quot;bisexual Galton–Watson process&quot;, where only couples reproduce. (&quot;Bisexual&quot; in this context refers to the number of sexes involved, not sexual orientation.) In this process, each child is supposed as male or female, independently of each other, with a specified probability, and a so-called &quot;mating function&quot; determines how many couples will form in a given generation. As before, reproduction of different couples is considered to be independent of each other. Now the analogue of the trivial case corresponds to the case of each male and female reproducing in exactly one couple, having one male and one female descendant, and that the mating function takes the value of the minimum of the number of males and females (which are then the same from the next generation onwards).

Since the total reproduction within a generation depends now strongly on the mating function, there exists in general no simple necessary and sufficient condition for final extinction as is the case in the classical Galton–Watson process. However, excluding the non-trivial case, the concept of the averaged reproduction mean (Bruss (1984)) allows for a general sufficient condition for final extinction, treated in the next section.

===Extinction criterion===

If in the non-trivial case the averaged reproduction mean per couple stays bounded over all generations and will not exceed 1 for a sufficiently large population size, then the probability of final extinction is always 1.

==Examples==
Citing historical examples of Galton–Watson process is complicated due to the history of family names often deviating significantly from the theoretical model. Notably, new names can be created, existing names can be changed over a person&#x27;s lifetime, and people historically have often assumed names of unrelated persons, particularly nobility. Thus, a small number of family names at present is not in itself evidence for names having become extinct over time, or that they did so due to dying out of family name lines – that requires that there were more names in the past &quot;and&quot; that they die out due to the line dying out, rather than the name changing for other reasons, such as vassals assuming the name of their lord.

Chinese names are a well-studied example of surname extinction: there are currently only about 3,100 surnames in use in China, compared with close to 12,000 recorded in the past, with 22% of the population sharing the names Li, Wang and Zhang (numbering close to 300 million people), and the top 200 names (6½%) covering 96% of the population. Names have changed or become extinct for various reasons such as people taking the names of their rulers, orthographic simplifications, taboos against using characters from an emperor&#x27;s name, among others. While family name lines dying out may be a factor in the surname extinction, it is by no means the only or even a significant factor. Indeed, the most significant factor affecting the surname frequency is other ethnic groups identifying as Han and adopting Han names. Further, while new names have arisen for various reasons, this has been outweighed by old names disappearing.

By contrast, some nations have adopted family names only recently. This means both that they have not experienced surname extinction for an extended period, and that the names were adopted when the nation had a relatively large population, rather than the smaller populations of ancient times. Further, these names have often been chosen creatively and are very diverse. Examples include:
* Japanese names, which in general use date only to the Meiji restoration in the late 19th century (when the population was over 30,000,000), have over 100,000 family names, surnames are very varied, and the government restricts married couples to using the same surname.
* Many Dutch names have included a formal family name only since the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century. Earlier, surnames originated from patronyms (e.g., Jansen = John&#x27;s son), personal qualities (e.g., de Rijke = the rich one), geographical locations (e.g., van Rotterdam), and occupations (e.g., Visser = the fisherman), sometimes even combined (e.g., Jan Jansz van Rotterdam). There are over 68,000 Dutch family names.
* Thai names have included a family name only since 1920, and only a single family can use a given family name; hence there are a great number of Thai names. Furthermore, Thai people change their family names with some frequency, complicating the analysis.

On the other hand, some examples of high concentration of family names are not primarily due to the Galton–Watson process:
* Vietnamese names have about 100 family names, with 60% of the population sharing three family names. The name Nguyễn alone is estimated to be used by almost 40% of the Vietnamese population, and 90% share 15 names. However, as the history of the Nguyễn name makes clear, this is in no small part due to names being forced on people or adopted for reasons unrelated to genetic relation.

== Other applications ==
Modern applications include the survival probabilities for a new mutant gene, or the initiation of a nuclear chain reaction, or the dynamics of disease outbreaks in their first generations of spread, or the chances of extinction of small population of organisms.

=== Nuclear fission ===
In the late 1930s, Leo Szilard independently reinvented Galton-Watson processes to describe the behavior of free neutrons during nuclear fission. This work involved generalizing formulas for extinction probabilities, which became essential for calculating the critical mass required for a continuous chain reaction with fissionable materials.
=== Genetics ===
The Galton–Watson model is an accurate description of Y chromosome transmission in genetics, and the model is thus useful for understanding human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups. Likewise, since mitochondria are inherited only on the maternal line, the same mathematical formulation describes transmission of mitochondria.

It explains (perhaps closest to Galton&#x27;s original interest) why only a handful of males in the deep past of humanity now have &quot;any&quot; surviving male-line descendants, reflected in a rather small number of distinctive human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups.

== Limitations ==
The model is of limited usefulness in understanding actual family name distributions, since in practice family names change for many other reasons, and dying out of name line is only one factor.

<doc id="350603" wikidata="Q2638486" url="?curid=350603" title="Kingdom of Cambodia (1953–1970)">
<text>The Kingdom of Cambodia, also known as the First Kingdom of Cambodia, and commonly referred to as the Sangkum period, refers to Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s first administration of Cambodia, lasting from the country&#x27;s independence from France in 1953 to a military coup d&#x27;état in 1970. Sihanouk continues to be one of the most controversial figures in Southeast Asia&#x27;s turbulent and often tragic postwar history. From 1955 until 1970, Sihanouk&#x27;s Sangkum was the sole legal party in Cambodia.

Following the end of World War II, France restored its colonial control over Indochina but faced local resistance against their rule, particularly from Communist guerilla forces. On 9 November 1953, Cambodia achieved independence from France under Norodom Sihanouk but still faced resistance from Communist groups such as United Issarak Front. As the Vietnam War escalated, Cambodia sought to retain its neutrality but in 1965, North Vietnamese soldiers were allowed to set up bases and in 1969, the United States began a bombing campaign against North Vietnamese soldiers in Cambodia. The Cambodian monarchy was abolished in a coup on October 9, 1970 headed by Prime Minister Lon Nol, who established the Khmer Republic which lasted until the fall of Phnom Penh in 1975.

== Geneva Conference and Viet Minh incursion ==
Although Cambodia had achieved independence by late 1953, its military situation remained unsettled. Noncommunist factions of the Khmer Issarak had joined the government, but pro-communist Viet Minh and United Issarak Front activities increased at the very time French Union forces were stretched thin elsewhere. In April 1954, several Viet Minh battalions crossed the border into Cambodia. Royalist forces engaged them but could not force their complete withdrawal. In part, the communists were attempting to strengthen their bargaining position at the Geneva Conference that had been scheduled to begin in late April.

The Geneva Conference was attended by representatives of Cambodia, North Vietnam, the Associated State of Vietnam (the predecessor of the Republic of Vietnam or South Vietnam), Kingdom of Laos, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and the United States. One goal of the conference was to restore a lasting peace in Indochina. The discussions on Indochina began on May 8, 1954. The North Vietnamese attempted to get representation for the resistance government that had been established in the south, but failed.

On July 21, 1954, the conference reached an agreement calling for a cessation of hostilities in Indochina. With respect to Cambodia, the agreement stipulated that all Viet Minh military forces be withdrawn within ninety days and that Cambodian resistance forces be demobilized within thirty days. In a separate agreement signed by the Cambodian representative, the French and the Viet Minh agreed to withdraw all forces from Cambodian soil by October 1954.

In exchange for the withdrawal of Viet Minh forces, the communist representatives in Geneva wanted full neutrality for Cambodia and for Laos that would prevent the basing of the United States Armed Forces in these countries. On the eve of the conference&#x27;s conclusion, however, the Cambodian representative, Sam Sary, insisted that, if Cambodia were to be genuinely independent, it must not be prohibited from seeking whatever military assistance it desired (Cambodia had earlier appealed to the U.S. for military aid). The conference accepted this point over North Vietnam&#x27;s strenuous objections. In the final agreement, Cambodia accepted a watered-down neutrality, vowing not to join any military alliance &quot;not in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations&quot; or to allow the basing of foreign military forces on its territory &quot;as long as its security is not threatened.&quot;

The conference agreement established the International Control Commission (officially called the International Commission for Supervision and Control) in all the Indochinese countries. Made up of representatives from Canada, India and Poland, it supervised the cease-fire, the withdrawal of foreign troops, the release of prisoners of war and overall compliance with the terms of the agreement. The French and most of the Viet Minh forces were withdrawn on schedule in October 1954.

== Domestic developments ==

The Geneva agreement also stipulated that general elections should be held in Cambodia during 1955 and that the International Control Commission should monitor them to ensure fairness. Sihanouk was more determined than ever to defeat the Democrats (who, on the basis of their past record, were expected to win the election). The king attempted unsuccessfully to have the constitution amended. On March 2, 1955, he announced his abdication in favor of his father, Norodom Suramarit. Assuming the title of &quot;Samdech&quot; (meaning &quot;Lord&quot; but in this context &quot;Prince&quot;), Sihanouk explained that this action was necessary in order to give him a free hand to engage in politics.

To challenge the Democrats, Prince Sihanouk established his own political machine, the Sangkum Reastr Niyum (Popular Socialist Community), commonly referred to as the Sangkum, which, despite its name, contained significant right-wing elements that were virulently anticommunist. The Sangkum&#x27;s emergence in early 1955 unified most right-wing groups under the prince&#x27;s auspices. In the September election, Sihanouk&#x27;s new party decisively defeated the Democrats, the Khmer Independence Party of Son Ngoc Thanh, and the leftist Pracheachon Party, winning 83% of the vote and all of the seats in the National Assembly.

The results of the 1955 general election have been attributed to fraud and intimidation. Voters were intimidated by a voting system involving colored pieces of paper that had to be put into a box in full view of Sihanouk&#x27;s political figures, soldiers and local police. In many cases, voting results were simply falsified as in the case where a district that had been a Viet Minh stronghold for years did not return a single vote for the far left. Writer Philip Short points to a 1957 statement by Sihanouk admitting that thirty six electoral districts had voted Pracheachon or Democrat majority whereas the official results said that they had won none.

Khmer nationalism, loyalty to the monarch, struggle against injustice and corruption, and protection of the Buddhist religion were major themes in Sangkum ideology. The party adopted a particularly conservative interpretation of Buddhism, common in the Theravada countries of Southeast Asia, that the social and economic inequalities among people were legitimate because of the workings of karma. For the poorer classes, virtuous and obedient conduct opened up the possibility of being born into a higher station in a future life.

In August 1957, Sihanouk summoned the leaders of the Democratic Party to what he called a &quot;debate&quot; at the Royal Palace. They were subjected to five hours of public humiliation. After the event was over, the participants were dragged from their cars and beaten with rifle butts by Sihanouk&#x27;s police and army.

Around the same time, the Pracheachon party put up five candidates for election. Sihanouk travelled in person to each district and the government mounted a full campaign against the party. The national radio service accused the party of being Vietnamese puppets. Posters showing supposed atrocities were hung in the districts. Eventually four candidates were intimidated into dropping out of the election. The only one who stayed in was credited by government officials with 396 votes out of an electorate of 30,000 in an area where Pracheachon was known to have deep support.

As the 1960s began, organized political opposition to Sihanouk and the Sangkum virtually had been largely driven underground. According to Vickery, the Democratic Party disbanded in 1957 after its leaders—who had been beaten by soldiers—requested the privilege of joining the Sangkum.

Despite its defense of the status quo, especially the interests of rural elites, the Sangkum was not exclusively a right-wing organization. Sihanouk invited a number of leftists into his party and government to provide a balance to the right-wing. Among these were future leaders of the Khmer Rouge. Hu Nim and Hou Yuon served in several ministries between 1958 and 1963, and Khieu Samphan served briefly as secretary of state for commerce in 1963.

But the independent parties of the left were generally targeted for destruction. On October 9, 1959, the editor of the Pracheachon Weekly Paper, Nop Bophann was shot to death outside his office by state security police. In 1960, some 2,000 people were detained for political reasons in a holding camp outside the capital. State Security cases were handled by a military tribunal from which there was no appeal. The tribunal handed down over 39 death decrees in its first six months of operation and it was widely known that the verdicts were the personal decision of Sihanouk.

In 1960, the editor of the paper &quot;l&#x27;Observateur&quot; was beaten in the street, stripped naked and photographed by members of the security police a few hundred yards from the Central Police Station. The editor reported the attack to the police. When the National Assembly summoned the minister responsible to explain the incident, he said it was the job of the police to protect the opponents of the government. The minister then proceeded to name members of the National Assembly who he considered to be in the same category of opponents.

One of the named deputies, Uch Ven, tabled a censure motion that had been drawn up against the minister. Sihanouk issued a statement afterward attacking the members of the National Assembly for their hostile attitude toward the police. Within days, &quot;l&#x27;Observateur&quot; and two other papers were closed by the government, 50 people were detained indefinitely for questioning and the political director of Sihanouk&#x27;s own newspaper was fired for an editorial objecting to heavy-handed political intimidation.

In July 1962, one of the leading leftists in the country, Tou Samouth was grabbed by the security police while seeking medicine for his child in a street market. He was held in secret and tortured for several days. He was eventually murdered, and his body was dumped into a wasteland in the Stung Meancheay district of Phnom Penh.

In March 1963, Sihanouk published a list of 34 leftists. After denouncing them as cowards, hypocrites, saboteurs, subversive agents and traitors, he demanded that they form a government for the country. Shortly after, they were brought into the presence of Sihanouk and each signed a statement saying that he was the only man capable of leading the country. After the incident, police officers were posted outside the residences and places of employment of each of the named men. They were essentially under permanent police observation.

The results of 1962 and 1963 were to drive the underground leftist movement out of the cities and into the countryside. Even underground politics or proxy actions through above-ground parties against the government had effectively ceased to be possible.

Sihanouk&#x27;s attitude toward the left was often cynical. He realized that his own political position was dependent on carefully balancing off the left in Cambodia against the right. If one side ever defeated the other, the next step of either party would be to end Sihanouk&#x27;s role in ruling the country. He often declared that if he had not been a prince, he would have become a revolutionary.

Sihanouk&#x27;s chronic suspicion of United States intentions in the region, his perception of revolutionary China as Cambodia&#x27;s most valuable ally, his respect for such prominent and capable leftists as Hou, Hu, and Khieu, and his vague notions of &quot;royal socialism&quot; all impelled him to experiment with socialist policies. It should also be recognized that each move toward socialism gave Sihanouk and his inner circle the ability to reward each other with lucrative political &quot;spoils&quot; and patronage. In 1963 the prince announced the nationalization of banking, foreign trade, and insurance as a means of reducing foreign control of the economy. In 1964 a state trading company, the National Export-Import Corporation, was established to handle foreign commerce.

The declared purposes of nationalization were to give Khmer nationals, rather than Chinese or Vietnamese, a greater role in the nation&#x27;s trade, to eliminate middlemen and to conserve foreign exchange through the limiting of unnecessary luxury imports. As a result of this policy, foreign investment quickly disappeared, and a nepotistic &quot;crony socialism&quot; emerged somewhat similar to the &quot;crony capitalism&quot; that evolved in the Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos. Lucrative state monopolies were parceled out to Sihanouk&#x27;s most loyal retainers, who &quot;milked&quot; them for cash.

Sihanouk was headed steadily for a collision with the right. To counter charges of one-man rule, the prince declared that he would relinquish control of candidate selection and would permit more than one Sangkum candidate to run for each seat in the September 1966 National Assembly election. The returns showed a surprising upsurge in the conservative vote at the expense of more moderate and left-wing elements, although Hou, Hu, and Khieu were reelected by their constituencies. General Lon Nol became prime minister.

Out of concern that the right wing might cause an irreparable split within the Sangkum and might challenge his domination of the political system, Sihanouk set up a &quot;counter government&quot; (like the British &quot;shadow cabinet&quot;) packed with his most loyal personal followers and with leading leftists, hoping that it would exert a restraining influence on Lon Nol. Leftists accused the general of being groomed by Western intelligence agencies to lead a bloody anticommunist coup d&#x27;état similar to that of General Suharto in Indonesia. Injured in an automobile accident, Lon Nol resigned in April 1967. Sihanouk replaced him with a trusted centrist, Son Sann. This was the twenty-third successive Sangkum cabinet and government to have been appointed by Sihanouk since the party was formed in 1955.

== Nonaligned foreign policy ==
Sihanouk&#x27;s non-aligned foreign policy, which emerged in the months following the Geneva Conference, cannot be understood without reference to Cambodia&#x27;s history of foreign subjugation and its very uncertain prospects for survival as the war between North Vietnam and South Vietnam intensified. Soon after the 1954 Geneva Conference, Sihanouk expressed some interest in integrating Cambodia into the framework of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), which included Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam within the &quot;treaty area&quot;, although none of these states was a signatory. But meetings in late 1954 with India&#x27;s Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Burma&#x27;s Premier U Nu made him receptive to the appeal of nonalignment. Moreover, the prince was somewhat uneasy about a United States-dominated alliance that included one old enemy, Thailand, and encompassed another, South Vietnam, each of which offered sanctuary to anti-Sihanouk dissidents.
At the Bandung Conference in April 1955, Sihanouk held private meetings with Premier Zhou Enlai of China and Foreign Minister Phạm Văn Đồng of North Vietnam. Both assured him that their countries would respect Cambodia&#x27;s independence and territorial integrity. His experience with the French, first as a client, then as the self-proclaimed leader of the &quot;royal crusade for independence&quot;, apparently led him to conclude that the United States, like France, would eventually be forced to leave Southeast Asia.

From this perspective, the Western presence in Indochina was only a temporary interruption of the dynamics of the region—continued Vietnamese (and perhaps even Thai) expansion at Cambodia&#x27;s expense. Accommodation with North Vietnam and friendly ties with China during the late 1950s and the 1960s were tactics designed to counteract these dynamics. China accepted Sihanouk&#x27;s overtures and became a valuable counterweight to growing Vietnamese and Thai pressure on Cambodia.

Cambodia&#x27;s relations with China were based on mutual interests. Sihanouk hoped that China would restrain the Vietnamese and the Thai from acting to Cambodia&#x27;s detriment. The Chinese, in turn, viewed Cambodia&#x27;s nonalignment as vital in order to prevent the encirclement of their country by the United States and its allies. When Premier Zhou Enlai visited Phnom Penh in 1956, he asked the country&#x27;s Chinese minority, numbering about 300,000, to cooperate in Cambodia&#x27;s development, to stay out of politics, and to consider adopting Cambodian citizenship.

This gesture helped to resolve a sensitive issue—the loyalty of Cambodian Chinese—that had troubled the relationship between Phnom Penh and Beijing. In 1960 the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship and Nonaggression. After the Sino-Soviet rift Sihanouk&#x27;s ardent friendship with China contributed to generally cooler ties with Moscow.

China was not the only large power to which Sihanouk looked for patronage. Cambodia&#x27;s quest for security and nation-building assistance impelled the prince to search beyond Asia and to accept help from all donors as long as there was no impingement upon his country&#x27;s sovereignty. With this end in mind, Sihanouk turned to the United States in 1955 and negotiated a military aid agreement that secured funds and equipment for the Royal Khmer Armed Forces (Forces Armées Royales Khmères—FARK). A United States Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) was established in Phnom Penh to supervise the delivery and the use of equipment that began to arrive from the United States. By the early 1960s, aid from Washington constituted 30% of Cambodia&#x27;s defense budget and 14% of total budget inflows (First Indochina War).
Relations with the United States proved to be stormy. United States officials both in Washington and in Phnom Penh frequently underestimated the prince and considered him to be an erratic figure with minimal understanding of the threat posed by Asian communism. Sihanouk easily reciprocated this mistrust because several developments aroused his suspicion of United States intentions toward his country.

One of these developments was the growing United States influence within the Cambodian armed forces. The processing of equipment deliveries and the training of Cambodian personnel had forged close ties between United States military advisers and their Cambodian counterparts. Military officers of both nations also shared apprehensions about the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. Sihanouk considered FARK to be Washington&#x27;s most powerful constituency in his country. The prince also feared that a number of high-ranking, rightist FARK officers led by Lon Nol were becoming too powerful and that, by association with these officers, United States influence in Cambodia was becoming too deeply rooted.

A second development included the repetition of overflights by United States and South Vietnamese military aircraft within Cambodian airspace and border incursions by South Vietnamese troops in hot pursuit of Viet Cong insurgents who crossed into Cambodian territory when military pressure upon them became too sustained. As the early 1960s wore on, this increasingly sensitive issue contributed to the deterioration of relations between Phnom Penh and Washington.

A third development was Sihanouk&#x27;s own belief that he had been targeted by United States intelligence agencies for replacement by a more pro-Western leader. Evidence to support this suspicion came to light in 1959 when the government discovered a plot to overthrow Sihanouk. The conspiracy, often known as the &quot;Bangkok Plot&quot;, involved several Khmer leaders suspected of American connections. Among them were Sam Sary, a leader of right-wing Khmer Serei troops in South Vietnam; Son Ngoc Thanh, the early nationalist leader once exiled into Thailand; and Dap Chhuon, the military governor of Siem Reap Province. Another alleged plot involved Dap Chuon&#x27;s establishment of a &quot;free&quot; state that would have included Siem Reap Province and Kampong Thum (Kampong Thom) Province and the southern areas of Laos that were controlled by the rightist Laotian prince, Boun Oum.

These developments, magnified by Sihanouk&#x27;s abiding suspicions, eventually undermined Phnom Penh&#x27;s relations with Washington. In November 1963, the prince charged that the United States was continuing to support the subversive activities of the Khmer Serei in Thailand and in South Vietnam, and he announced the immediate termination of Washington&#x27;s aid program to Cambodia. Relations continued to deteriorate, and the final break came in May 1965 amid increasing indications of airspace violations by South Vietnamese and by United States aircraft and of ground fighting between Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troops and Viet Cong insurgents in the Cambodian border areas.
In the meantime, Cambodia&#x27;s relations with North Vietnam and with South Vietnam, as well as the rupture with Washington, reflected Sihanouk&#x27;s efforts to adjust to geopolitical realities in Southeast Asia and to keep his country out of the escalating war in neighboring South Vietnam. In the early-to-mid-1960s, this effort required a tilt toward Hanoi because the government in Saigon tottered on the brink of anarchy. In the cities, the administration of Ngo Dinh Diem and the military regimes that succeeded it had become increasingly ineffectual and unstable, while in the countryside the government forces were steadily losing ground to the Hanoi-backed insurgents.

To observers in Phnom Penh, South Vietnam&#x27;s short-term viability was seriously in doubt, and this compelled a new tack in Cambodian foreign policy. First, Cambodia severed diplomatic ties with Saigon in August 1963. The following March, Sihanouk announced plans to establish diplomatic relations with North Vietnam and to negotiate a border settlement directly with Hanoi. These plans were not implemented quickly, however, because the North Vietnamese told the prince that any problem concerning Cambodia&#x27;s border with South Vietnam would have to be negotiated directly with the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NFLSVN).

Cambodia opened border talks with the front in mid-1966, and the latter recognized the inviolability of Cambodia&#x27;s borders a year later. North Vietnam quickly followed suit. Cambodia was the first foreign government to recognize the NFLSVN&#x27;s Provisional Revolutionary Government after it was established in June 1969. Sihanouk was the only foreign head of state to attend the funeral of Ho Chi Minh, North Vietnam&#x27;s deceased leader, in Hanoi three months later.

In 1965, Sihanouk negotiated a deal with China and North Vietnam. Whereas before Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces had temporarily moved into Cambodian territory, the deal allowed them to build permanent military facilities on Cambodian soil. Cambodia also opened its ports to shipments of military supplies from China and the Soviet Union to the Vietnamese. In exchange for these concessions, large amounts of money passed into the hands of the Cambodian elite. In particular, deals were made where China would purchase rice at inflated prices from the Cambodian government. While Sihanouk talked neutrality in public, he had effectively pushed Cambodia directly into the Vietnam War.

After making friends with North Vietnam and China, Sihanouk turned politically to the right and unleashed a wave of repression throughout the country. The repression drove most of the political left in the country underground. While Sihanouk&#x27;s deal with China and Vietnam in the short term kept both countries from arming the Cambodian left, it did not prevent the Cambodian left from launching an unsupported rebellion on its own.
In the late 1960s, while preserving relations with China and with North Vietnam, Sihanouk sought to restore a measure of equilibrium by improving Cambodia&#x27;s ties with the West. This shift in course by the prince represented another adjustment to prevailing conditions in Asia. The Cultural Revolution had made the Chinese very difficult with which to carry on relations. The increasing North Vietnamese presence in Eastern Cambodia was destabilizing Cambodia politically and economically.

When the Cambodian left went underground in the late 1960s, Sihanouk made concessions to the right since he did not have any force that he could play against them. Cambodia served as the southern terminus of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the logistical resupply route of the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong. The use by these forces of sanctuaries in Cambodia put Cambodian neutrality in jeopardy. China, preoccupied with its Cultural Revolution, did not intercede with Hanoi. On Cambodia&#x27;s eastern border, even in the face of the communist Tet Offensive in 1968, South Vietnam surprisingly had not collapsed and President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu&#x27;s government was bringing a measure of stability to that war-ravaged country.

As the government in Phnom Penh began to feel keenly the loss of economic and military aid from the United States, which had totaled about US$400 million between 1955 and 1963, it began to have second thoughts about the break with Washington. The unavailability of American equipment and spare parts were exacerbated by the small amount and poor quality of Soviet, Chinese, and French substitutes.

In late 1967 and in early 1968, Sihanouk signaled that he would raise no objection to hot pursuit of communist forces by South Vietnamese or by United States troops into Cambodian territory. Washington, in the meantime, accepted the recommendation of the United States Military Assistance Command--Vietnam (MACV) and, beginning in March 1969, ordered a series of airstrikes (dubbed the Menu series) against Cambodian sanctuaries used by the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong.

Whether or not these bombing missions were authorized aroused considerable controversy, and assertions by the Nixon administration that Sihanouk had &quot;allowed&quot; or even &quot;encouraged&quot; them were disputed by critics such as British journalist William Shawcross. But in retrospect, Sihanouk allowing US bombing as a counter-weight to his previous decision to allow the Vietnamese to establish base areas seems consistent with his policy strategy in that US was the only force he could use as a counter-weight to the Vietnamese presence in Cambodia.

On a diplomatic level, however, the Menu airstrikes did not impede bilateral relations from moving forward. In April 1969, Nixon sent a note to the prince affirming that the United States recognized and respected &quot;the sovereignty, neutrality and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia with its present frontiers.&quot; Shortly thereafter, in June 1969, full diplomatic relations were restored between Phnom Penh and Washington.

==Early phases of the Cambodian Left==
The history of the communist movement in Cambodia can be divided into six phases: the emergence of the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP), whose members were almost exclusively Vietnamese, before World War II; the ten-year struggle for independence from the French, when a separate Cambodian communist party, the Kampuchean (or Khmer) People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (KPRP), was established under Vietnamese auspices; the period following the Second Party Congress of the KPRP in 1960, when Saloth Sar (Pol Pot after 1976) and other future Khmer Rouge leaders gained control of its apparatus; the revolutionary struggle from the initiation of the Khmer Rouge insurgency in 1967–68 to the fall of the Lon Nol government in April 1975; the Democratic Kampuchea regime, from April 1975 to January 1979; and the period following the Third Party Congress of the KPRP in January 1979, when Hanoi effectively assumed control over Cambodia&#x27;s government and communist party.

Much of the movement&#x27;s history has been shrouded in mystery, largely because successive purges, especially during the Democratic Kampuchea period, have left so few survivors to recount their experiences. One thing is evident, however, the tension between Khmer and Vietnamese was a major theme in the movement&#x27;s development. In the three decades between the end of World War II and the Khmer Rouge victory, the appeal of communism to Western educated intellectuals (and to a lesser extent its more inchoate attraction for poor peasants) was tempered by the apprehension that the much stronger Vietnamese movement was using communism as an ideological rationale for dominating the Khmer.

The analogy between the Vietnamese communists and the Nguyễn dynasty, which had legitimized its encroachments in the 19th century in terms of the &quot;civilizing mission&quot; of Confucianism, was persuasive. Thus, the new brand of indigenous communism that emerged after 1960 combined nationalist and revolutionary appeals and, when it could afford to, exploited the virulent anti-Vietnamese sentiments of the Khmers. Khmer Rouge literature in the 1970s frequently referred to the Vietnamese as yuon (barbarian), a term dating from the Angkorian period.

In 1930 Ho Chi Minh founded the Vietnamese Communist Party by unifying three smaller communist movements that had emerged in Tonkin, in Annam, and in Cochinchina during the late 1920s. The name was changed almost immediately to the ICP, ostensibly to include revolutionaries from Cambodia and Laos. Almost without exception, however, all the earliest party members were Vietnamese. By the end of World War II, a handful of Cambodians had joined its ranks, but their influence on the Indochinese communist movement and on developments within Cambodia was negligible.

Viet Minh units occasionally made forays into Cambodian bases during their war against the French, and, in conjunction with the leftist government that ruled Thailand until 1947, the Viet Minh encouraged the formation of armed, left-wing Khmer Issarak bands. On April 17, 1950 (twenty-five years to the day before the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh), the first nationwide congress of the Khmer Issarak groups convened, and the United Issarak Front was established. Its leader was Son Ngoc Minh (possibly a brother of the nationalist Son Ngoc Thanh), and a third of its leadership consisted of members of the ICP. According to the historian David P. Chandler, the leftist Issarak groups, aided by the Viet Minh, occupied a sixth of Cambodia&#x27;s territory by 1952; and, on the eve of the Geneva Conference, they controlled as much as one half of the country.

In 1951 the ICP was reorganized into three national units—the Vietnam Workers&#x27; Party, the Lao Itsala, and the KPRP. According to a document issued after the reorganization, the Vietnam Workers&#x27; Party would continue to &quot;supervise&quot; the smaller Laotian and Cambodian movements. Most KPRP leaders and rank-and-file seem to have been either Khmer Krom, or ethnic Vietnamese living in Cambodia. The party&#x27;s appeal to indigenous Khmers appears to have been minimal.

According to Democratic Kampuchea&#x27;s version of party history, the Viet Minh&#x27;s failure to negotiate a political role for the KPRP at the 1954 Geneva Conference represented a betrayal of the Cambodian movement, which still controlled large areas of the countryside and which commanded at least 5,000 armed men. Following the conference, about 1,000 members of the KPRP, including Son Ngoc Minh, made a &quot;Long March&quot; into North Vietnam, where they remained in exile. In late 1954, those who stayed in Cambodia founded a legal political party, the Pracheachon Party, which participated in the 1955 and the 1958 National Assembly elections.

In the September 1955 election, it won about 4% of the vote but did not secure a seat in the legislature. Members of the Pracheachon were subject to constant harassment and to arrests because the party remained outside Sihanouk&#x27;s Sangkum. Government attacks prevented it from participating in the 1962 election and drove it underground. Sihanouk habitually labeled local leftists the Khmer Rouge, a term that later came to signify the party and the state headed by Pol Pot, Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan, and their associates.

During the mid-1950s, KPRP factions, the &quot;urban committee&quot; (headed by Tou Samouth), and the &quot;rural committee&quot; (headed by Sieu Heng), emerged. In very general terms, these groups espoused divergent revolutionary lines. The prevalent &quot;urban&quot; line, endorsed by North Vietnam, recognized that Sihanouk, by virtue of his success in winning independence from the French, was a genuine national leader whose neutralism and deep distrust of the United States made him a valuable asset in Hanoi&#x27;s struggle to &quot;liberate&quot; South Vietnam.

Champions of this line hoped that the prince could be persuaded to distance himself from the right wing and to adopt leftist policies. The other line, supported for the most part by rural cadres who were familiar with the harsh realities of the countryside, advocated an immediate struggle to overthrow the &quot;feudalist&quot; Sihanouk. In 1959 Sieu Heng defected to the government and provided the security forces with information that enabled them to destroy as much as 90% of the party&#x27;s rural apparatus. Although communist networks in Phnom Penh and in other towns under Tou Samouth&#x27;s jurisdiction fared better, only a few hundred communists remained active in the country by 1960.

== Paris Student Group ==

During the 1950s, Khmer students in Paris organized their own communist movement, which had little, if any, connection to the hard-pressed party in their homeland. From their ranks came the men and women who returned home and took command of the party apparatus during the 1960s, led an effective insurgency against Sihanouk and Lon Nol from 1968 until 1975, and established the regime of Democratic Kampuchea.

Pol Pot, who rose to the leadership of the communist movement in the 1960s, was born in 1928 (some sources say in 1925) in Kampong Thum Province, north of Phnom Penh. He attended a technical high school in the capital and then went to Paris in 1949 to study radio electronics (other sources say he attended a school for printers and typesetters and also studied civil engineering). Described by one source as a &quot;determined, rather plodding organizer&quot;, he failed to obtain a degree, but, according to the Catholic priest, Fr. François Ponchaud, he acquired a taste for the classics of French literature as well as for the writings of Marx.

Another member of the Paris student group was Ieng Sary. He was a Chinese-Khmer born in 1930 in South Vietnam. He attended the elite Lycée Sisowath in Phnom Penh before beginning courses in commerce and politics at the &quot;Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris&quot; (more widely known as &quot;Sciences Po&quot;) in France. Khieu Samphan, considered &quot;one of the most brilliant intellects of his generation&quot;, was born in 1931 and specialized in economics and politics during his time in Paris. In talent he was rivaled by Hou Yuon, born in 1930, who was described as being &quot;of truly astounding physical and intellectual strength&quot;, and who studied economics and law. Son Sen, born in 1930, studied education and literature; Hu Nim, born in 1932, studied law.

These men were perhaps the most educated leaders in the history of Asian communism. Two of them, Khieu Samphan and Hou Yuon, earned doctorates from the University of Paris; Hu Nim obtained his degree from the University of Phnom Penh in 1965. In retrospect, it seems enigmatic that these talented members of the elite, sent to France on government scholarships, could launch the bloodiest and most radical revolution in modern Asian history. Most came from landowner or civil servant families. Pol Pot and Hou Yuon may have been related to the royal family.

An older sister of Pol Pot had been a concubine at the court of King Monivong. Three of the Paris group forged a bond that survived years of revolutionary struggle and intraparty strife, Pol Pot and Ieng Sary married Khieu Ponnary and Khieu Thirith (also known as Ieng Thirith), purportedly relatives of Khieu Samphan. These two well-educated women also played a central role in the regime of Democratic Kampuchea.

The intellectual ferment of Paris must have been a dizzying experience for young Khmers fresh from Phnom Penh or the provinces. A number sought refuge in the dogma of orthodox Marxism-Leninism. At some time between 1949 and 1951, Pol Pot and Ieng Sary joined the French Communist Party, the most tightly disciplined and Stalinist of Western Europe&#x27;s communist movements. The party was also very anti-intellectual. In 1951 the two men went to East Berlin to participate in a youth festival. This experience is considered to have been a turning point in their ideological development.

Meeting with Khmers who were fighting with the Viet Minh (and whom they subsequently judged to be too subservient to the Vietnamese), they became convinced that only a tightly disciplined party organization and a readiness for armed struggle could achieve revolution. They transformed the Khmer Students&#x27; Association (KSA), to which most of the 200 or so Khmer students in Paris belonged, into an organization for nationalist and leftist ideas. Inside the KSA and its successor organizations was a secret organization known as the Cercle Marxiste. The organization was composed of cells of three to six members with most members knowing nothing about the overall structure of the organization.

In 1952 Pol Pot, Hou Yuon, Ieng Sary, and other leftists gained notoriety by sending an open letter to Sihanouk calling him the &quot;strangler of infant democracy.&quot; A year later, the French authorities closed down the KSA. In 1956, however, Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan helped to establish a new group, the Khmer Students&#x27; Union. Inside, the group was still run by the Cercle Marxiste.

The doctoral dissertations written by Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan express basic themes that were later to become the cornerstones of the policy adopted by Democratic Kampuchea. The central role of the peasants in national development was espoused by Hou Yuon in his 1955 thesis, &quot;The Cambodian Peasants and Their Prospects for Modernization&quot;, which challenged the conventional view that urbanization and industrialization are necessary precursors of development. The major argument in Khieu Samphan&#x27;s 1959 thesis, &quot;Cambodia&#x27;s Economy and Industrial Development&quot;, was that the country had to become self-reliant and had to end its economic dependency on the developed world. In its general contours, Khieu&#x27;s work reflected the influence of a branch of the &quot;dependency theory&quot; school, which blamed lack of development in the Third World on the economic domination of the industrialized nations.

== KPRP Second Congress ==

After returning to Cambodia in 1953, Pol Pot threw himself into party work. At first he went to join with forces allied to the Viet Minh operating in the rural areas of Kampong Cham Province (Kompong Cham). After the end of the war, he moved to Phnom Penh under Tou Samouth&#x27;s &quot;urban committee&quot; where he became an important point of contact between above-ground parties of the left and the underground secret communist movement. His comrades, Ieng Sary and Hou Yuon, became teachers at a new private high school, the Lycée Kambuboth, which Hou Yuon helped to establish.

Khieu Samphan returned from Paris in 1959, taught as a member of the law faculty of the University of Phnom Penh, and started a left-wing, French-language publication, &quot;L&#x27;Observateur&quot;. The paper soon acquired a reputation in Phnom Penh&#x27;s small academic circle. The following year, the government closed the paper, and Sihanouk&#x27;s police publicly humiliated Khieu by beating, undressing and photographing him in public—as Shawcross notes, &quot;not the sort of humiliation that men forgive or forget.&quot; Yet the experience did not prevent Khieu from advocating cooperation with Sihanouk in order to promote a united front against United States activities in South Vietnam. As mentioned, Khieu Samphan, Hou Yuon, and Hu Nim were forced to &quot;work through the system&quot; by joining the Sangkum and by accepting posts in the prince&#x27;s government.

In late September, 1960, twenty-one leaders of the KPRP held a secret congress in a vacant room of the Phnom Penh railroad station. This pivotal event remains shrouded in mystery because its outcome has become an object of contention (and considerable historical rewriting) between pro-Vietnamese and anti-Vietnamese Khmer communist factions. The question of cooperation with, or resistance to, Sihanouk was thoroughly discussed. Tou Samouth, who advocated a policy of cooperation, was elected general secretary of the KPRP that was renamed the Workers&#x27; Party of Kampuchea (WPK).

His ally, Nuon Chea (also known as Long Reth), became deputy general secretary. However, Pol Pot and Ieng Sary were named to the Political Bureau to occupy the third and the fifth highest positions in the renamed party&#x27;s hierarchy. The name change is significant. By calling itself a workers&#x27; party, the Cambodian movement claimed equal status with the Vietnam Workers&#x27; Party. The pro-Vietnamese regime of the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) implied in the 1980s that the September 1960 meeting was nothing more than the second congress of the KPRP.

On July 20, 1962, Tou Samouth was murdered by the Cambodian government. In February 1963, at the WPK&#x27;s second congress, Pol Pot was chosen to succeed Tou Samouth as the party&#x27;s general secretary. Tou&#x27;s allies, Nuon Chea and Keo Meas, were removed from the Central Committee and replaced by Son Sen and Vorn Vet. From then on, Pol Pot and loyal comrades from his Paris student days controlled the party center, edging out older veterans whom they considered excessively pro-Vietnamese.

In July 1963, Pol Pot and most of the central committee left Phnom Penh to establish an insurgent base in Rotanokiri (Ratanakiri) Province in the northeast. Pol Pot had shortly before been put on a list of thirty four leftists who were summoned by Sihanouk to join the government and sign statements saying Sihanouk was the only possible leader for the country. Pol Pot and Chou Chet were the only people on the list who escaped. All the others agreed to cooperate with the government and were afterward under 24 hour surveillance by the police.

The region Pol Pot and the others moved to was inhabited by tribal minorities, the Khmer Loeu, whose rough treatment (including resettlement and forced assimilation) at the hands of the central government made them willing recruits for a guerrilla struggle. In 1965 Pol Pot made a visit of several months duration to North Vietnam and China. He probably received some training in China, which must have enhanced his prestige when he returned to the WPK&#x27;s liberated areas. Despite friendly relations between Sihanouk and the Chinese, the latter kept Pol Pot&#x27;s visit a secret from Sihanouk. In September 1966, the party changed its name in secret to the Kampuchean (or Khmer) Communist Party (KCP). The change in the name of the party was a closely guarded secret. Lower ranking members of the party and even the Vietnamese were not told of it and neither was the membership until many years later.
