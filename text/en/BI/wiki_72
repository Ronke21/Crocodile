<text>A Foehn, or Föhn (, , ), is a type of dry, relatively warm downslope wind in the lee of a mountain range. It is a rain shadow wind that results from the subsequent adiabatic warming of air that has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes (see orographic lift). As a consequence of the different adiabatic lapse rates of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than equivalent elevations on the windward slopes. 

Foehn winds can raise temperatures by as much as in just a matter of hours. Switzerland, southern Germany, and Austria have a warmer climate due to the Foehn, as moist winds off the Mediterranean Sea blow over the Alps.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Foehn&quot; (, ) arose in the Alpine region. Originating from Latin , a mild west wind of which Favonius was the Roman personification and probably transmitted by or just , the term was adopted as . In the Southern Alps, the phenomenon is known as but also and in Serbo-Croatian and Slovene. The German word (pronounced the same way) also means &#x27;hairdryer&#x27;, while the word is a genericized trademark today owned by AEG. The form &quot;phon&quot; is used in French-speaking parts of Switzerland as well as in Italy.

The name was originally used to refer to the south wind which blows during the winter months and brings thaw conditions to the northern side of the Alps. Because Föhn later became a generic term that was extended to other mountain ranges around the world that experience similar phenomena, the name &quot;Alpine föhn&quot; () was coined for the Föhns of the Alpine region.

== Causes ==

There are four known causes of the Foehn warming and drying effect. These mechanisms often act together, with their contributions varying depending on the size and shape of the mountain barrier and on the meteorological conditions, such as the upstream wind speed, temperature and humidity.

===Condensation and precipitation===
When winds blow over elevated terrain, air forced upwards expands and cools due to the decrease in pressure with height. Since colder air can hold less water vapor, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain or snow on the mountain&#x27;s upwind slopes. The change of state from vapor to liquid water releases latent heat energy which heats the air, partially countering the cooling that occurs as the air rises. The subsequent removal of moisture as precipitation renders this heat gain by the air irreversible, leading to the warm, dry, Foehn conditions as the air descends in the mountain&#x27;s lee. This mechanism has become a popular textbook example of atmospheric thermodynamics. However, the common occurrence of &#x27;dry&#x27; Foehn events, where there is no precipitation, implies there must be other mechanisms.

===Isentropic draw-down===
Isentropic draw-down is the draw-down of warmer, drier air from aloft. When the approaching winds are insufficiently strong to propel the low-level air up and over the mountain barrier, the airflow is said to be &#x27;blocked&#x27; by the mountain and only air higher up near mountain-top level is able to pass over and down the lee slopes as Foehn winds. These higher source regions provide Foehn air that becomes warmer and drier on the leeside after it is compressed with descent due to the increase in pressure towards the surface.

===Mechanical mixing===
When river water passes over rocks, turbulence is generated in the form of rapids, and white water reveals the turbulent mixing of the water with the air above. Similarly, as air passes over mountains, turbulence occurs and the atmosphere is mixed in the vertical. This mixing generally leads to a downward warming and upward moistening of the cross-mountain airflow, and consequently to warmer, drier Foehn winds in the valleys downwind.

===Radiative warming===
Dry Foehn conditions are responsible for the occurrence of rain shadows in the lee of mountains, where clear, sunny conditions prevail. This often leads to greater daytime radiative (solar) warming under Foehn conditions. This type of warming is particularly important in cold regions where snow or ice melt is a concern or where avalanches are a risk.

== Effects ==

Winds of this type are also called &quot;snow-eaters&quot; for their ability to make snow and ice melt or sublimate rapidly. This is a result not only of the warmth of Foehn air, but also its low relative humidity. Accordingly, Foehn winds are known to contribute to the disintegration of ice shelves in the polar regions.

Foehn winds are notorious among mountaineers in the Alps, especially those climbing the Eiger, for whom the winds add further difficulty in ascending an already difficult peak.

They are also associated with the rapid spread of wildfires, making some regions which experience these winds particularly fire-prone.

== Purported physiological effects ==
Anecdotally, residents in areas of frequent Foehn winds have reported experiencing a variety of illnesses ranging from migraines to psychosis. The first clinical review of these effects was published by the Austrian physician Anton Czermak in the 19th century. A study by the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München found that suicide and accidents increased by 10 percent during Foehn winds in Central Europe. The causation of &quot;Föhnkrankheit&quot; (English: Foehn-sickness) is unproven. Labels for preparations of aspirin combined with caffeine, codeine and the like will sometimes include &quot;Föhnkrankheit&quot; among the indications. Evidence for effects from Chinook winds remains anecdotal, as it does for New Zealand&#x27;s Nor&#x27;wester. 

In some regions, Foehn winds are associated with causing circulatory problems, headaches, or similar ailments. Researchers have found, however, the Foehn wind&#x27;s warm temperature to be beneficial to humans in most situations, and have theorized that the reported negative effects may be a result of secondary factors, such as changes in the electrical field or in the ion state of the atmosphere, the wind&#x27;s relatively low humidity, or the generally unpleasant sensation of being in an environment with strong and gusty winds.

== Local examples ==

Regionally, these winds are known by many different names. These include:
;in Africa
* Bergwind in South Africa

;in the Americas
*The Brookings Effect on the southwestern coast of Oregon, also known as the Chetco Effect.
* Chinook winds east of the Rocky Mountains and the Cascade Range in the United States and Canada, and north, east and west of the Chugach Mountains of Alaska, United States
* Foehn winds in the foothills of the southern Appalachian Mountains, which can be unusual compared to other Foehn winds in that the relative humidity typically changes little due to the increased moisture in the source air mass
*The Santa Ana winds of southern California, including the Sundowner winds of Santa Barbara, are in some ways similar to the Föhn, but originate in dry deserts as a katabatic wind. However, traditional Föhn conditions frequently prevail along the Santa Monica and Santa Ana Mountains and their respective leeward valleys, the San Fernando Valley and the Riverside County portion of the Inland Empire region.

* In winter, a Foehn effect occurs in the West Azerbaijan province, Iran (around Lake Urmia) as manifested by the province&#x27;s dry winters relative to those in the windward part of the region (Northern Iraq or Kurdistan Region and Hakkâri Province in Turkey). For example, the winter rainfall of Urmia and Salmas in Iranian Azerbaijan is much lower than Batifa and Soran in Iraqi Kurdistan, and Hakkâri in the Hakkâri Province, which are roughly on the same latitude but are on the windward side of the Zagros Mountains.
* Loo in Indo-Gangetic Plain

<text>In literary criticism, close reading is the careful, sustained interpretation of a brief passage of a text. A close reading emphasizes the single and the particular over the general, via close attention to individual words, the syntax, the order in which the sentences unfold ideas, as well as formal structures. 

Close reading is thinking about both what is said in a passage (the content) and how it is said (the form, i.e., the manner in which the content is presented), leading to possibilities for observation and insight.

== History ==
Literary close reading and commentaries have extensive precedent in the exegesis of religious texts, and more broadly, hermeneutics of ancient works. For example, Pazand, a genre of middle Persian literature, refers to the &quot;Zend&quot; (literally: &#x27;commentary&#x27;/&#x27;translation&#x27;) texts that offer explanation and close reading of the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism. The scriptural commentaries of the Talmud offer a commonly cited early predecessor to close reading. In Islamic studies, the close reading of the Quran has flourished and produced an immense corpus. But the closest religious analogy to contemporary literary close reading, and the principal historical connection with its birth, is the rise of the higher criticism, and the evolution of textual criticism of the Bible in Germany in the late eighteenth century.

In the practice of literary studies, the technique of close reading emerged in 1920s Britain in the work of I. A. Richards, his student William Empson, and the poet T.S. Eliot, all of whom sought to replace an &quot;impressionistic&quot; view of literature then dominant with what Richards called a &quot;practical criticism&quot; focused on language and form. American New Critics in the 1930s and 1940s anchored their views in similar fashion, and promoted close reading as a means of understanding that the autonomy of the work (often a poem) mattered more than anything else, including authorial intention, the cultural contexts of reception, and most broadly, ideology. For these critics, including Cleanth Brooks, William K. Wimsatt, John Crowe Ransom, and Allen Tate, only close reading, because of its attentiveness to the nuances and interrelation of language and form, could address the work in its complex unity. Their influence on American literary criticism and English departments held sway for several decades, and even after New Criticism faded from prominence in American universities in the waning years of the Cold War, close reading remained a fundamental, almost naturalized, skill amongst literary critics. By the turn of the 21st century, efforts to historicize New Critical aesthetics and its apolitical pretense prompted scholars, especially in departments of English, to debate the fate of close reading, asking about its status as a critical practice.

In two of its 2010 bulletins, the Association of Departments of English (ADE) featured a cluster of articles that attempted to take stock of what the 21st century held for close reading. The articles were motivated, as all of the scholars remarked, by the changes they had observed in the work of their colleagues and students—as well as in contemporary culture—that made them think again about why close reading mattered to the study of literature. Jonathan Culler noted that because the discipline had taken close reading for granted, it had disappeared from discussions of the goals of literary criticism. For Culler, as for Jane Gallop, that absence needed remedying, and therefore signaled an opportunity for departments of English to renew—in order to capitalize on—one of the more distinctive traits of studying literature. If New Criticism and its isolationist stance had given way to the politicization of literary studies, and if technological developments were changing the very ways in which people read, Culler and Gallop emphasized that the signature of close reading, meticulous attention to the workings of language and form, still had value. N. Katherine Hayles and John Guillory, meanwhile, each interested in the impact of digital media on the ways people read, argued that close reading skills were not only translatable to the digital context, but could also exist productively alongside the hyper-reading that web interfaces and links had generated.

== Principles and practice ==
While New Criticism popularized close reading in universities, it tended to emphasize its principles and offer extended examples rather than prescribe specific methods and practices. As John Guillory points out, close reading entails &quot;a technique, a particular kind of methodical procedure that can be described but not prescribed, and that is transmitted largely by demonstration and imitation.&quot; A tendency towards what Vincent B. Leitch calls &quot;canonical statements&quot; appeared in essays and book-length studies, from John Crowe Ransom&#x27;s &quot;The New Criticism&quot; (1941) and Allen Tate&#x27;s &quot;A Note on Autotelism&quot; (1949), to Cleanth Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Well Wrought Urn&quot; (1947), Rene Wellek and Austin Warren&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Literature&quot; (1949), and W.K. Wimsatt&#x27;s &quot;The Verbal Icon&quot; (1954). The first ten chapters of &quot;The Well Wrought Urn&quot; thus focus individually on poems across British literary history (John Donne, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Alexander Pope, Thomas Gray, John Keats, William Wordsworth, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, W.B. Yeats, and T.S. Eliot) before concluding with &quot;The Heresy of Paraphrase&quot;, in which Brooks abstracts the premises on which his analyses rest. Meanwhile, when Wellek and Warren describe their preference for an &quot;intrinsic&quot; study of literature in &quot;Theory of Literature&quot;, they refer to examples of elements they claim are crucial to a work—from euphony, rhythm, and meter to image, metaphor, and myth—and cite concrete examples of these drawn from literary history, but do not indicate steps by which readers might translate such thinking into their own analyses. Wimsatt takes a mixed approach in &quot;The Verbal Icon&quot;, combining theoretical chapters (&quot;The Intentional Fallacy&quot;, &quot;The Affective Fallacy&quot;) with those that discuss concerns he feels are necessary to the study of poetry (&quot;The Concrete Universal&quot;, &quot;Symbol and Metaphor&quot;, &quot;The Substantive Level&quot;, &quot;One Relation of Rhyme to Reason&quot;, &quot;When is Variation &#x27;Elegant&#x27;?&quot;, &quot;Verbal Style: Logical and Counterlogical&quot;), but he too leaves it to his readers to imagine how they might deploy these views.

As Culler notes in his essay for the 2010 bulletin of the American Departments of English, this tendency not to make statements of method meant that most students of the New Critics learned by example. Thus in the New Critical classroom, &quot;the charismatic pedagogue could pose a question you had not thought of about relations between form and meaning or point to a textual difficulty that had escaped your attention.&quot; More than fifty years later, this &quot;closeness of close reading&quot; remains vital to the work of more recent thinkers whose thinking has contributed to the radical changes in literary studies and displaced New Criticism. Of these he cites his contemporary, the deconstructionist Barbara Johnson, who stands out for her claim that the value of close reading lies in its capacity for taking seriously what does not immediately make sense. Well aware of the stark differences between New Criticism and deconstruction, Culler here brings the two together, suggesting that their shared investments indicate an understanding of close reading worth maintaining.

In French criticism, close reading is similar to &quot;explication de texte&quot;, the tradition of textual interpretation in literary study, as proposed by Gustave Lanson. As an analytical technique, &quot;close reading&quot; compares and contrasts the concept of &quot;distant reading&quot;, the technique for &quot;understanding literature, not by studying particular texts, but by aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data&quot;, as described, by Kathryn Schulz, in &quot;What is Distant Reading?&quot;, an article about the literary scholar Franco Moretti.

==Examples==
Brooks&#x27;s discussion of John Keats&#x27;s &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; embodies his use of close reading. In &quot;Keats&#x27;s Sylvan Historian&quot;, he finds the controversy over the poem&#x27;s famous lines misplaced, and insists instead that &quot;the ambiguity&quot; of &quot;Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know&quot; is best understood as an expression of the urn itself (151–153). The poem pursues this ambiguity, he writes, in lines that describe the urn on the one hand as a &quot;bride of quietness&quot; and a &quot;foster-child of silence&quot; and on the other, a &quot;sylvan historian&quot; (155). In this way the poem describes the urn in paradoxical terms much as the urn utters a paradoxical line. Brooks then pursues this logic by considering how &quot;sylvan historian&quot; might not only describe the urn as a kind of historian but also the kind of history the urn is said to tell. Further, if he claims that this history is uncertain because it&#x27;s not clear &quot;what men or gods&quot; feature in it, he continues that line of thinking as he proceeds through the ode&#x27;s stanzas: when he emphasizes that the &quot;unheard melodies&quot; of the figures depicted on the urn&#x27;s face are &quot;sweeter than any audible music&quot;, that &quot;action goes on though the actors are motionless&quot;, that &quot;the maiden, always to be kissed, never actually kissed&quot;, that the &quot;boughs...cannot shed their leaves&quot;, and when he claims that this &quot;ironic undercurrent&quot; only increases over the course of the poem, to culminate in those infamous lines (156–159, 164). From following the poem in this way, Brooks arrives at the assertion that his interpretation is &quot;derived from the context of the &quot;Ode&quot; itself&quot; (164).

Brooks&#x27;s close reading is typical of the New Critical investment in the textual object alone. Yet scholars have also found close reading productive for more politically and socially invested work, thereby refusing the New Critical belief in literary transcendence while seizing on the care with which it treated textuality. In &quot;The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination&quot; (1979), best known as one of the earliest statements of feminist literary criticism, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar deployed close reading to make a case for the distinctiveness of the female literary imagination. The sixteen chapters of &quot;Madwoman&quot; thus pursue their arguments—that women writers expressed their anxiety about authorship, their rage over being constrained to docile femininity, their canny encoding of their patriarchal critique—with the attention to language, imagery, and form Gilbert and Gubar had been trained to wield as graduate students in the late 1960s. New Critical echoes are thus evident in the individual chapters devoted to close readings of Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Emily Bronte&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, Charlotte Bronte&#x27;s &quot;The Professor&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot; &quot;Eyre&quot;, &quot;Shirley&quot;, and &quot;Villette&quot;, but so is the political innovation. Reviewers—academic and mainstream—recognized this trait, describing the two scholars as &quot;gnostic heretics who claim to have found the secret code that unlocks the mysteries in old texts&quot; (Schreiber 11) and their interpretations as a &quot;skillful joint peeling away of the layers&quot; of women&#x27;s writing&quot; (129).

In an even more extreme example, Jacques Derrida in &quot;Ulysses Gramophone&quot; devotes eighty-six pages to the word &quot;yes&quot; in James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, an effort which J. Hillis Miller describes as a &quot;hyperbolic, extravagant, even outrageous explosion&quot; of the technique of close reading.

== Teaching close reading in the United States ==

The push for more close-reading instruction in primary and secondary education is partially due to increased feedback from college professors in the early-mid 2000s that students were arriving in university classrooms with few comprehension skills. The increased demand for students to acquire concrete skills in high school that they would need in transitioning to higher education and to adult life culminated in the creation of the Common Core State Standards in 2009. Since then, there has been a push for English language arts (ELA) teachers, especially at the secondary level, to help students develop close-reading strategies. Several of the ELA standards for reading literature require students to be able to cite direct textual evidence, and to analyze words in context. For example, CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RL.9-10.4 asks students to &quot;Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in the text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the cumulative impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone (e.g., how the language evokes a sense of time and place; how it sets a formal or informal tone).&quot;

=== Strategies ===
Today, as most states have adopted the Common Core Standards, there is an increasing number of resources designed to help teachers instruct and implement close-reading strategies in their classrooms. In 2012, Kylene Beers and Robert E. Probst published &quot;Notice &amp; Note: Strategies for Close Reading&quot;, which established six &quot;signposts&quot; that alert readers to significant moments in a work of literature and encourage students to read closely.

Another resource, developed by Beth Burke (NBCT) for the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; NIE (Newspaper in Education), presents the steps involved in close reading and how to scaffold the strategies for students. She recommends using the &quot;gradual release model&quot; in instruction, beginning by modeling a close reading in front of the class, then having students work on the strategy in groups before attempting it alone.

Additional ways students are supported in close-reading instruction include providing graphic organizers that help them group their ideas with textual evidence. Many other educational resources and guides to close reading exist in order to help students of all levels and in particular, close reading poetry. For example, see The Close Reading of Poetry: A Practical Introduction and Guide to Explication.

<doc id="351450" wikidata="Q955034" url="?curid=351450" title="Diablo wind">
<text>Diablo wind is a name that has been occasionally used for the hot, dry wind from the northeast that typically occurs in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California during the spring and fall. 

The same wind pattern also affects other parts of California&#x27;s coastal ranges and the western slopes of Sierra Nevada, with many media and government groups using the term Diablo winds for strong, dry downslope wind over northern and central California.

==Name==
The term first appeared shortly after the 1991 Oakland firestorm, perhaps to distinguish it from the comparable, and more familiar, hot dry wind in Southern California known as the Santa Ana winds. In fact, in decades previous to the 1991 fire, the term &quot;Santa Ana&quot; was occasionally used as well for the Bay Area dry northeasterly wind, such as the one that was associated with the 1923 Berkeley Fire.

The name &quot;Diablo wind&quot; refers to the fact that the wind blows into the inner Bay Area from the direction of Mount Diablo in adjacent Contra Costa County and evoking the fiery, sensationalist connotation inherent in &quot;devil wind&quot;.

==Formation==
The Diablo wind is created by the combination of strong inland high pressure at the surface, strongly sinking air aloft, and lower pressure off the California coast. The air descending from aloft as well as from the Coast Ranges compresses as it sinks to sea level where it warms as much as 20 °F (11 °C), and loses relative humidity.

Because of the elevation of the coastal ranges in north-central California, the thermodynamic structure that occurs with the Diablo wind pattern favors the development of strong ridge-top and lee-side downslope winds associated with a phenomenon called the &quot;hydraulic jump&quot;. While hydraulic jumps can occur with Santa Ana winds, the same thermodynamic structure that occurs with them typically favors &quot;gap&quot; flow more frequently. Santa Ana winds are katabatic, gravity-driven winds, draining air off the high deserts, while the Diablo-type wind originates mainly from strongly sinking air from aloft, pushed toward the coast by higher pressure aloft. Thus, Santa Anas are strongest in canyons, whereas a Diablo wind is first noted and blows strongest atop the various mountain peaks and ridges around the Bay Area.

In both cases, as the air sinks, it heats up by compression and its relative humidity drops. This warming is in addition to, and usually greater than, any contact heating that occurs as the air stream crosses the Central Valley and the Diablo Valley. This is the reverse of the normal summertime weather pattern in which an area of low pressure (called the California Thermal Low) rather than high pressure lies east of the Bay Area, drawing in cooler, more humid air from the ocean.

==Impacts==
The dry offshore wind, already strong because of the offshore pressure gradient, can become quite strong with gusts reaching speeds of or higher, particularly along and in the lee of the ridges of the Coast Range. This effect is especially dangerous with respect to wildfires as it can enhance the updraft generated by the heat in such fires. While the Diablo wind pattern occurs in both the spring and fall, it is most dangerous in the fall, when vegetation is at its driest. California&#x27;s predominantly Mediterranean climate has an extended dry period from May through October.

Effects tend to be halved at farther southern coasts, and even can spawn Sundowner winds in Santa Barbara. Although Santa Ana winds may recur, Diablo events in autumn tend to precede Santa Ana wind events by a few weeks with a lull in between as solar incidence declines. Southern Californian coasts from Ventura County south are generally unaffected by Diablo events.

<doc id="351463" wikidata="Q1163938" url="?curid=351463" title="Barriers to entry">
<text>In theories of competition in economics, a barrier to entry, or an economic barrier to entry, is a fixed cost that must be incurred by a new entrant, regardless of production or sales activities, into a market that incumbents do not have or have not had to incur.
Because barriers to entry protect incumbent firms and restrict competition in a market, they can contribute to distortionary prices and are therefore most important when discussing antitrust policy. Barriers to entry often cause or aid the existence of monopolies and oligopolies, or give companies market power.
Barriers of entry also have an importance in industries. First of all it is important to identify that some exist naturally, such as brand loyalty.
Governments can also create barriers to entry to meet consumer protection laws, protecting the public. In other cases it can also be due to inherent scarcity of public resources needed to enter a market.

==Definitions==

Various conflicting definitions of &quot;barrier to entry&quot; have been put forth since the 1950s. This has caused there to be no clear consensus on which definition should be used.

McAfee, Mialon, and Williams list seven common definitions in economic literature in chronological order including:

In 1956, Joe S. Bain used the definition &quot;an advantage of established sellers in an industry over potential entrant sellers, which is reflected in the extent to which established sellers can persistently raise their prices above competitive levels without attracting new firms to enter the industry.&quot; McAfee et al. criticized this as being tautological by putting the &quot;consequences of the definition into the definition itself.&quot;

In 1968, George Stigler defined an entry barrier as &quot;A cost of producing that must be borne by a firm which seeks to enter an industry but is not borne by firms already in the industry.&quot; McAfee et al. criticized the phrase &quot;is not borne&quot; as being confusing and incomplete by implying that only current costs need be considered.

In 1979, Franklin M. Fisher gave the definition &quot;anything that prevents entry when entry is socially beneficial.&quot; McAfee et al. criticized this along the same lines as Bain&#x27;s definition.

In 1981, Baumol and Willig gave the definition &quot;An entry barrier is anything that requires an expenditure by a new entrant into an industry, but that imposes no equivalent cost upon an incumbent&quot; 

In 1994, Dennis Carlton and Jeffrey Perloff gave the definition, &quot;anything that prevents an entrepreneur from instantaneously creating a new firm in a market.&quot; Carlton and Perloff then dismiss their own definition as impractical and instead use their own definition of a &quot;long-term barrier to entry&quot; which is defined very closely to the definition in the introduction.

In 2011, Wheelen and Hunger gave the definition &quot;an obstruction that makes it difficult for a company to enter an industry&quot;.

A primary barrier to entry is a cost that constitutes an economic barrier to entry on its own. An ancillary barrier to entry is a cost that does not constitute a barrier to entry by itself, but reinforces other barriers to entry if they are present.

An antitrust barrier to entry is &quot;a cost that delays entry and thereby reduces social welfare relative to immediate but equally costly entry&quot;. This contrasts with the concept of &quot;economic barrier to entry&quot; defined above, as it can delay entry into a market but does not result in any cost-advantage to incumbents in the market. All economic barriers to entry are antitrust barriers to entry, but the converse is not true.

==Examples==

===Porter&#x27;s barriers to entry===

An article produced by Michael Porter in 2008 stated that new entrants to an industry have the desire to gain market share, and often substantial resources. The seriousness of the threat of entry depends on the barriers present and on the reaction from existing competitors.
Michael Porter&#x27;s article shows 6 main sources of barriers to entry for entrants:

The first barrier to entry found in the article is the supply-side economies of scale. These scales arise when incumbents produce larger volumes of their product for a lower total cost. This can occur if they spread their fixed costs over more units, utilize a more efficient technology or are on better terms with their suppliers. 

The second barrier to entry is the demand-side benefits of scale or network effects. According to Porters article, this arises when a buyer&#x27;s willingness to pay for a company&#x27;s product increases with the number of other buyers who also patronize the company. Essentially, through network effects the buyers may trust the larger companies more than smaller ones. This barrier discourages the entrant due to incumbent&#x27;s embedded data and the structural adjustment programs made internally. 

The third barrier is capital requirements for the initial investment and running of a company. Companies often require a large amount of capital when starting to pay for fixed facilities but also produce their inventory and fund start-up losses. The magnitude of the barrier increases if the capital is required for unrecoverable expenditure such as advertising and research and development. 

The fourth barrier is incumbency advantages independent of size. For the incumbent, this barrier theoretically gives them a cost and quality advantage over the entrants. Specifically, these are often regarding proprietary technology, preferential access to raw materials, favourable geographic locations, established brand identities and even cumulative experience. This barrier more specifically outlines the favourable traits incumbents adopt over-time due to their established place in the industry, making it unavoidable for entrants in certain industries.
The fifth barrier is the unequal access to distribution channels between the incumbents and the entrants. Most companies require some type of distribution channel for the transport of their product. In the case where entrants cannot bypass this barrier, they end up forming their own distribution channel. The problem for entrants is that the more limited the wholesale and retail channels are, the more competitors have tied them up and consequently the more difficult entry into the industry will be.
The final barrier is restrictive government policy. Importantly, this barrier can either aid or hinder an entrant and even effect the other barriers. Restrictive government policies can block entrance through licensing requirements and restrictions on foreign investments. A clear example these may include the alcohol and taxi industries. Policies can heighten other entry barriers through patenting laws on technologies and even environmental and safety regulations that raise economies of scale for entrants. 

Furthermore, a potential new market entrant&#x27;s expectations about the reaction of the existing competitors within the industry will also be a contributing factor on their decision to enter the market. 

An entrant may reconsider entering an industry or choose a new one altogether if incumbents have displayed conscious reactions to entrants in the past. Another discouraging indication for an entrant is if the incumbent is in possession of substantial resources to respond to an entrant. These resources generally consist of excess cash and unused borrowing power. This may also allow for incumbents to lower prices to either keep their market share or lower their excess capacity, another discouraging sign for an entrant.

===Primary economic barriers to entry===

* Distributor agreements – Exclusive agreements with key distributors or retailers can make it difficult for other manufacturers to enter an industry. This is a particular problem if, prior to entry, the other firms in the market use intensive distribution strategies in order to restrict the access of potential entrants to distributors. In response, if access to existing distribution channels is too difficult, new entrants may create their own. For example, new low-cost airlines often encourage passengers to book online instead of through travel agents.
* Intellectual property – A potential entrant requires access to production technology as efficient as that of the combatant monopolist in order to freely enter a market. Patents, however, give a firm the legal right to stop other firms from producing a product for a given period of time, and so restrict entry. Patents are intended to encourage invention and technological progress by guaranteeing proceeds as an incentive. Similarly, trademarks and servicemarks may represent a kind of entry barrier for a particular product or service if the market is dominated by one or a few well-known names. Incumbent firms may have an exclusive right to use the brand name, making it expensive or impossible for new entrants to license rights to names.
* Capital requirements - Many industries require the investment of large financial resources to start a new business, which deters new entrants. For example, new airlines require millions of dollars for purchasing planes, staff training etc. In addition, new entrants often experience serious difficulties in raising funds for unrecoverable expenses, such as advertising and R&amp;D. In the pharmaceutical industry, for instance, companies may invest heavily in research in order to develop Covid vaccines, then end up with disappointing results and lose all of their investment.
* Restrictive practices – Established policies may protect existing players and restrict entry. For instance, air transport agreements may make it difficult for new airlines to obtain landing slots at some airports. Or Certificate of Need (CON) laws in some of US states may require medical service providers to file an application and prove community need before offering their services—a practice that has been found to benefit incumbents.
* Supplier agreements – Exclusive agreements with businesses that represent key links in the supply chain can make it difficult for other manufacturers to enter an industry, e.g. when suppliers offer significant discounts to certain buyers or offer their product exclusively.
* Customer Switching barriers – At times, it may be difficult or expensive for customers to switch providers, especially if they have to retrain employees or modify internal information systems. Indeed, switching costs are often intentionally made high in order to discourage customers from changing suppliers and adopting the technological innovations provided by others. 
* Tariffs – Taxes on imports prevent foreign firms from entering into domestic markets.
* Taxes – Smaller companies typically fund expansions out of retained profits so high tax rates hinder their growth and ability to compete with existing firms. Larger firms may be better able to avoid high taxes through either loopholes written into law favoring large companies or by using their larger tax accounting staffs to better avoid paying the higher taxes.
* Zoning – Government allows certain economic activity in specified land areas but excludes others, allowing monopoly over the land needed.

===Contentious examples===

The following examples are sometimes cited as barriers to entry, but don&#x27;t fit all the commonly cited definitions of a barrier to entry. Many of these fit the definition of antitrust barriers to entry or ancillary economic barriers to entry.

* Economies of scale – Cost advantages raise the stakes in a market, which can deter and delay entrants into the market. Bulk buying offers buyers larger negotiating power to get the lowest price and they take advantage on that. This makes scale economies an antitrust barrier to entry, but they can also be ancillary. The per-unit cost will be lower in scale economies due to the spread of fixed costs to larger volumes, technology efficiencies and better supplier terms, therefore new entrants join the industry either on a large scale or at a cost disadvantage. Cost advantages can sometimes be quickly reversed by advances in technology. For example, the development of personal computers has allowed small companies to make use of database and communications technology which was once extremely expensive and only available to large corporations.
* Network effect/Demand-side benefits of scale – When a good or service has a value that increases on average for every additional customer, this exerts a similar antitrust and ancillary barrier to that of economies of scale. Customers are more willing to buy crucial products from larger companies than newcomers. It increases the difficulty of entering the industry or reduces the initial profit margins for new entrants.
* Government regulations – Government regulations are rules having the force of law, prescribed by a superior or competent authority, relating to the actions of those under the authority&#x27;s control. Licences, for example, may be required when entering a specific field, particularly in industries that are heavily protected by the government. As a result, the field is dominated by government-owned firms (e.g., energy), or existing players are protected in the market (e.g., Taxi service or TV). The regulations themselves may set the barriers for not letting others to enter a market, or requirements for licenses and permits may raise the level of investment required, creating an antitrust barrier to entry. However, sometimes government regulations may make entry easier, such as AIR-21 which requires airports to make facilities available to access by all carriers.
* Advertising – Incumbent firms can seek to make it difficult for new competitors by spending heavily on advertising that new firms would find more difficult to afford or unable to staff and or undertake. This is known as the market power theory of advertising. Here, established firms&#x27; use of advertising creates a consumer perceived difference in its brand from other brands to a degree that consumers see its brand as a slightly different product. Since the brand is seen as a slightly different product, products from existing or potential competitors cannot be perfectly substituted in place of the established firm&#x27;s brand. This makes it hard for new competitors to gain consumer acceptance. It reflected by brand promoting and the increase of customer loyalties.
* Capital – Investments in equipment, building, and raw materials may represent ancillary barriers, particularly in the case of sunk costs, which can increase the strength of barriers to entry. Sunk costs may also lead to monopoly profits, improper resource allocation and low efficiency. For capital-intensive industries, entrants will also need much more financial capital.
* Uncertainty – When a market actor has various options with overlapping possible profits, choosing any one of them has an opportunity cost. This cost might be reduced by waiting until conditions are clearer, which can result in an ancillary antitrust barrier.
* Incumbency advantages independent of scale – Incumbents often have advantages over newcomers, including proprietary technology, know-how, favorable access to raw materials, favorable geographic locations, established brand reputation and learning curve cost advantages. It is reflected by learning curve effects and economies of scale, and it is one of the most critical barriers to entry strategies.
* Vertical integration – Vertical integration, a firm&#x27;s coverage of more than one level of production while pursuing practices which favor its own operations at each level, is often cited as an entry barrier as it requires a similar large-scale effort on the part of competitors.
* Research and development – Some products, such as microprocessors, require a large upfront investment in technology which will deter potential entrants. The existing firms in the market may also use efficient investments in research and development to increase technological economies of scale, and boost industry development, which work against entrants who lack the funding and resources to enter the market. However, critics also point out that entry barriers can reduce the efficiency of R&amp;D because firms have no incentive to efficiently invest in innovation.
* Customer loyalty – Large incumbent firms may have existing customers loyal to established products. As a result, the presence of established strong brands within a market can be a barrier to entry.
* Control of resources – If a single firm has control of a resource essential for a certain industry, then other firms may be unable to compete in the industry.
* Inelastic demand – One strategy to penetrate a market is to sell at a lower price than the incumbents. This, however, is ineffective with price-insensitive consumers.
* Predatory pricing – Predatory pricing is the practice of selling at a loss to make competition more difficult for new firms that cannot bear such losses as easily as a large dominant firm with large lines of credit or cash reserves. Illegal in most places, predatory pricing, however, is difficult to prove. &quot;See antitrust.&quot; In the context of international trade, such practices are often called dumping.
*Occupational licensing – Examples include educational, licensing, and quota limits on the number of people who can enter a certain profession.
* Product differentiation of incumbents - Incumbent firms show advantages in advertising, brands, customer loyalties or product differentiation which can enable them to be first in the market.
* Number of competitors - During a period when the number of companies is increasing, the possibility of market entry is higher, Conversely, the likelihood of market entry is less during a period defined by a large number of business failures.
* Price - Intensive price competition can hinder entrants, who may be unable to set their prices as low as incumbents. As a result, industries with high barriers to entry often contain a monopoly or oligopoly with dominant power in terms of price. This dominance allows them to charge a higher price or, if other firms join the market, to use their market power and cash flow to lower prices, beating out the new competition.
* Technology and technological change - Technological change, often seen in high technology sectors, can have a tremendous impact on economies of scale.
* Market concentration - Market concentration, though it usually has only a minor effect, can still work against new entrants.
* Seller concentration - Seller concentration can have a major effect on new entrants, making it difficult for them to enter the market, contributing further to seller concentration.
* Divisionalization - Typically in highly profitable oligopolistic industries, it is cheaper for an incumbent to establish a new department than it would be for new entrants. 
* Selling expenses - A change in demand function may be endogenous to market entry due to sales efforts.
* Incumbent&#x27;s expected reaction to market entry - If incumbent firms expect new entrants to represent a threat, and are capable of preventing market entry, they may take action to prevent new entrants from competing.
* Possession of strategic raw materials - An ability to access strategic raw materials provides advantages for the accessing companies, such as an absolute cost advantage.

==Classification and examples==
Michael Porter classifies the markets into four general cases :

* High barrier to entry and high exit barrier (for example, telecommunications, energy)
* High barrier to entry and low exit barrier (for example, consulting, education)
* Low barrier to entry and high exit barrier (for example, hotels, ironworks)
* Low barrier to entry and low exit barrier (for example, retail, electronic commerce)

These markets combine the attributes:
* Markets with high entry barriers have few players and thus high profit margins.
* Markets with low entry barriers have many players and thus low profit margins.
* Markets with high exit barriers are unstable and not self-regulated, so the profit margins fluctuate very much over time.
* Markets with a low exit barrier are stable and self-regulated, so the profit margins do not fluctuate much over time.

The higher the barriers to entry and exit, the more prone a market tends to be a natural monopoly. The reverse is also true. The lower the barriers, the more likely the market will become perfect competition.

==Market structure==
A structural barrier to entry is a cost incurred by new entrants to a market that is caused by inherent industry conditions, such as upfront capital investment, economies of scale and network effects. For example, the cost to develop a factory and obtain the initial capital required for manufacturing can be seen as a structural barrier to entry.

A strategic barrier to entry is a cost incurred by new entrants that is artificially created or enhanced by existing firms. This could take the form of exclusive contracts, whether supply or demand-side, or through price manipulation in non-competitive markets.

A market with perfect competition features zero barriers to entry. Under perfect competition firms are unable to control prices, and produce similar or identical goods. This means that firms cannot operate strategic barriers to entry. 
Perfect competition implies no economies of scale; this means that structural barriers to entry are also not possible under perfect competition.

Monopolistic competition can allow for medium barriers to entry. Because the enterprises can earn their short-term revenue through innovation and marketing new products to push the price higher than average costs and marginal costs, barriers to entry can be made higher. However, due to the low cost of the information in monopolistic competition, the barrier of entry is lower than in oligopolies or monopolies as new entrants come.

An Oligopoly will typically see high barriers to entry, due to the size of the existing enterprises and the competitive advantages gained from that size. These competitive advantages could arise from economies of scale, but are also commonly associated with the excess capacity of capital held by incumbent firms, which allows them to engage in temporarily loss-inducing behaviour to force any potential competitor out of the market.

The distinguishing characteristic of a duopoly is a market featuring solely two firms. Competition in a duopoly can vary due to what is being set in the market: price or quantity (see Cournot competition and Bertrand competition). It is generally agreed that a duopoly will feature higher barriers to entry than an oligopoly, as firms within a duopoly have a greater potential for absolute advantage with respect to demand.

A market with a monopolistic firm will often have very high to absolute barriers to entry. The incumbent firm can obtain tremendous profits through a pure monopoly market, therefore there are very large incentives for the creation of strategic barriers, as they want to continue to earn excess profits in the short and long term. These barriers can take several forms, including cost advantage, advertising, and strategic reaction in the form of temporary deviation from equilibrium behaviour.

==Barriers to entry in non-economic areas==
For political parties the electoral threshold is a barrier to entry to the political competition. One dataset with barriers to entry to the political competition by country is the &quot;Barriers to parties&quot; indicator in V-Dem Democracy indices.

<doc id="351465" wikidata="Q1247120" url="?curid=351465" title="Digestive biscuit">
<text>A digestive biscuit, sometimes described as a sweet-meal biscuit, is a semi-sweet biscuit that originated in Scotland. The digestive was first developed in 1839 by two doctors to aid digestion. The term &quot;digestive&quot; is derived from the belief that they had antacid properties around the time the biscuit was first introduced due to the use of sodium bicarbonate as an ingredient. Historically, some producers used diastatic malt extract to &quot;digest&quot; some of the starch that existed in flour prior to baking.

First manufactured by McVitie&#x27;s in 1892 to a secret recipe developed by Sir Alexander Grant, their digestive is the best-selling biscuit in the United Kingdom. In 2009, the digestive was ranked the fourth most popular biscuit for &quot;dunking&quot; into tea among the British public, with the chocolate digestive (produced by McVitie&#x27;s since 1925) coming in at number one. The chocolate variant from McVitie&#x27;s is routinely ranked the UK&#x27;s favourite snack.

== History ==

In 1839, digestives were developed in the United Kingdom by two Scottish doctors to aid digestion. In an 1851 issue of &quot;The Lancet&quot;, London&#x27;s advertising section offered &quot;brown meal&quot; digestive biscuits. At the time, it was asserted that grain millers knew only of bran and endosperm. After 10% of the whole grain&#x27;s coarser outer-bran coat was removed, and because the innermost 70% of pure endosperm was reserved for other uses, brown meal, representing only 20% of the whole grain, remained, consisting of about 15% fine bran and 85% white flour. By 1912, it was more widely known that brown meal included the germ, which lent a characteristic sweetness.

Digestives featured in advertisements for the Berkshire-based biscuit company Huntley &amp; Palmers in 1876, with digestives sold by chemists alongside indigestion powder. Rival biscuit company, Edinburgh-based McVitie&#x27;s, has Golden-baked their best-selling digestives to a secret recipe developed by Sir Alexander Grant since 1892. A recipe was given in Cassell&#x27;s &quot;New Universal Cookery Book&quot; of 1894. In 1889, John Montgomerie of Scotland filed a U.S. patent application, which was granted in 1890. This patent asserted a prior patent existed in England dated 1886. The U.S. patent, titled &quot;Making Malted Bread&quot;, included instructions for the manufacture of digestive biscuits. Montgomerie claimed this saccharification process would make &quot;nourishing food for people of weak digestion&quot;. Despite rumours that it is illegal for them to be sold under their usual name in the US, they are, in fact, widely available in the imported food sections of grocery stores and by mail order.

== Ingredients ==
The typical digestive biscuit contains coarse brown wheat flour (which gives it its distinctive texture and flavour), sugar, malt extract, vegetable oil, wholemeal, raising agents (usually sodium bicarbonate, tartaric acid and malic acid), and salt. Some varieties also contain dried whey, oatmeal, cultured skimmed milk, and emulsifiers such as DATEM.

A digestive biscuit averages around 70 calories, although this varies according to the factors involved in its production.

== Consumption ==

Digestive biscuits are frequently eaten with tea or coffee. Sometimes, the biscuit is dunked into the tea and eaten quickly due to the biscuit&#x27;s tendency to disintegrate when wet. Digestive biscuits are one of the top 10 biscuits in the UK for dunking in tea. The digestive biscuit is also used as a cracker with cheeses, and is often included in &quot;cracker selection&quot; packets.

In the UK, McVitie&#x27;s digestive is the best selling biscuit, with 80 million packs sold annually, though there are many other popular brands (such as Cadbury’s) as well as supermarkets&#x27; own versions. Digestives are also popular in food preparation for making into bases for cheesecakes and similar desserts.

== Chocolate digestives ==

Digestive biscuits with a chocolate coating on one side are also available. The coating can consist of dark, white, or milk chocolate, although white chocolate digestives are quite rare. The chocolate digestive was originally produced by McVitie&#x27;s in 1925 as the Chocolate Homewheat Digestive. Other varieties include the basic biscuit with chocolate shavings throughout (chocolate &quot;chips&quot; in the biscuit mix) or a layer of caramel, mint chocolate, orange-flavoured chocolate, or plain chocolate. They are manufactured at McVitie&#x27;s Harlesden factory in London. American travel writer Bill Bryson described the chocolate digestive as &quot;a British masterpiece&quot;.

In 2009, the McVitie&#x27;s chocolate digestive was named as the most popular biscuit in the UK to dunk into tea. The chocolate variant from McVitie&#x27;s is routinely ranked the UK&#x27;s favourite snack. A YouGov poll saw Cadbury’s digestive ranked the second most popular biscuit in the UK after McVitie&#x27;s.

== In popular culture ==
McVitie&#x27;s digestive biscuits have become known among fans of the Beatles because they were the cause of an argument between George Harrison and John Lennon during a recording session for the group&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. The incident was recounted by recording engineer Geoff Emerick in his book &quot;Here, There, and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of The Beatles&quot;. According to Emerick, Lennon&#x27;s wife Yoko Ono was in the recording studio and at one point helped herself to Harrison&#x27;s box of McVitie&#x27;s while the Beatles were in the control room listening to a playback of the song they had just recorded. Harrison became angry at Ono, and his subsequent outburst caused Lennon to lose his temper in response.

Chocolate digestives were part of the technical challenge to the bakers in series 13, episode 6 of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;. They were also the technical challenge to the bakers in episode 2, season 2 of &quot;The Great Canadian Baking Show&quot;.

<doc id="351466" wikidata="Q219855" url="?curid=351466" title="Zonda wind">
<text>Zonda wind () is a regional term for the foehn wind that often occurs on the eastern slope of the Andes, in Argentina. 

==Formation==

The Zonda is a dry wind (often carrying dust) which comes from the polar maritime air, warmed by descent from the crest, which is approximately above sea level. It may exceed a velocity of .

The Zonda wind is produced by the northeastward movement of polar fronts, and although it is hot and dry at the low-lands, it is the main mechanism for snow precipitation at the high altitude chains, where it looks as &quot;viento blanco&quot;, reaching speeds sometimes over 200 km/h. Thus, instead of being a snow-eater, this wind is particularly important for this arid region, as it is connected to the buildup of the winter snow cover and accumulation over the scarce local glaciers.

==Occurrence==
While this type of föhn wind may occur over most central parts of western Argentina, its effects are more impressive in La Rioja, San Juan, and northern Mendoza provinces, where the mountain barrier (the Andes) is higher, while to the north the Puna plateau dissipates these winds.

According to studies (conducted over the period 1967–1976), the Zonda wind most commonly starts during the afternoon (between 12 and 6 PM), and tends to last between 1 and 12 hours, though it may present itself intermittently for as long as 2 or 3 days. It is countered usually by the entrance of cold air masses moving northwestward (&quot;viento sur&quot;). In 90% of the cases, the phenomenon takes place between May and November.

==Alternative usage==
The term &quot;zonda&quot; also describes a hot, humid north wind in the Pampas, in advance of a depression moving eastwards, and preceding the pampero. This wind is also called the &quot;sondo&quot;.

<text>Corneliu Baba (; 18 November 1906, Craiova – 28 December 1997) was a Romanian painter, primarily a portraitist, but also known as a genre painter and an illustrator of books.

==Early life==
Having first studied under his father, the academic painter Gheorghe Baba, Baba studied briefly at the National School of Fine Arts in Bucharest, but did not receive a degree. His first public exhibition was in 1934 in the spa town of Băile Herculane; this led to his studying later that year under Nicolae Tonitza in Iași, finally receiving a diploma in Fine Arts from the Iași Academy of Fine Arts in 1938, where he was named assistant to the Chair of Painting in 1939 and a Professor of Painting in 1946.

Shortly after his 1948 official debut with a painting called &quot;The Chess Player&quot; at the Art Salon in Bucharest, he was arrested and briefly imprisoned in Galata Prison in Iași. The following year he was suspended without explanation from his faculty position and moved from Iași to Bucharest.

Despite an initially uneasy relationship with communist authorities who denounced him as formalist, Baba soon established himself as an illustrator and artist. In 1955 he was allowed to travel to the Soviet Union, and won a Gold Medal in an international exhibition in Warsaw, Poland. In 1956, Baba accompanied &quot;The Chess Player&quot; and two other paintings shown at the Venice Biennale, after which the paintings traveled on to exhibits in Moscow, Leningrad, and Prague.

==Fame==

In 1958 Baba was appointed Professor of Painting at the &quot;Nicolae Grigorescu&quot; Institute of Fine Arts in Bucharest, where Niculiţă Secrieriu and Ștefan Câlția were among his pupils. The same year he received the title of Emeritus Master of Art. By this time, his earlier problems with the communist authorities appear to have been smoothed over. In the next decade, both he and his paintings were to travel the world, participating in exhibitions in places as diverse as Cairo, Helsinki, Vienna, and New Delhi, culminating in a 1964 solo exhibition in Brussels. In 1962, the Romanian government gave him the title of &quot;People&#x27;s Artist&quot;; in 1963 he was appointed a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy, and in 1964 was similarly honored by the East Berlin Academy of Fine Art.

Honors and exhibitions continued to accumulate, ranging from a 1970 solo exhibition in New York City to the receipt of the Order of the Star of the Romanian Socialist Republic, 2nd class in 1971. While his name became a household word in Romania and, to a lesser extent, throughout the Eastern bloc, he never achieved comparable fame in the West.

In 1988, Baba was seriously injured by an accident in his studio, and was immobilized for several months. In 1990, following the Romanian Revolution, he was elevated to titular membership in the Romanian Academy. Shortly before his death in 1997, Baba published his memoir, &quot;Notes by an Artist of Eastern Europe&quot;. He was posthumously awarded the Prize for Excellence by the Romanian Cultural Foundation.

Corneliu Baba appears in the People of influence painting of Chinese artists Zhang An, Li Tiezi, and Dai Dudu.

In 2019, the Han Yuchen Museum in Handan (China) presented the largest Corneliu Baba Chinese museum retrospective.

==Art==

Perhaps unfashionably for a 20th-century painter, Baba consciously worked in the tradition of the Old Masters, although, from the outset of his studies with his father, he was also influenced by expressionism, Art Nouveau, academicism and &quot;remnants&quot; of Impressionism.
Baba himself cited El Greco, Rembrandt, and Goya as particularly strong influences. 
This did not put him in good stead either with the official Socialist realism of the Eastern bloc (where, especially in the early Communist years, he periodically received damning criticism—and sometimes punishment, such as being suspended from teaching—for his &quot;formalism&quot;).

Nearly all of Corneliu Baba&#x27;s work remains in Romania; hardly a major museum in that country is without some of his work. The Art Museum in Timișoara possesses a very nice and rich collection (over 80 works) of Baba&#x27;s paintings. Among his notable works are a 1952 portrait of Mihail Sadoveanu (now in Bucharest&#x27;s National Art Museum) and a 1957 portrait of Krikor Zambaccian, (now in the Zambaccian Museum, also in Bucharest). One of his few pieces on public display outside of Romania is a rather impressionistic 1977-79 group scene entitled &quot;Fear&quot;, (one of several in a &quot;Fears&quot; series) in the Szépművészeti Museum in Budapest.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Baba did an extensive series of paintings of Harlequins and &quot;Mad Kings&quot;; most of the latter remained in the artist&#x27;s personal collection until his death, much as with Francisco Goya and his &quot;black paintings&quot;.

<text>Tame Horomona Rehe, also known by the anglicised name Tommy Solomon, (7 May 1884 – 19 March 1933) is believed by most to have been the last Moriori of unmixed ancestry. Moriori are the indigenous people of the Chatham Islands.

==Early life==
Solomon was born at Waikaripi in the Chatham Islands and raised on the Moriori Reserve near Manukau Point. His mother died in 1903 but because of his youthful irresponsibility the interest in her land was vested in his father during his lifetime.

==Career as farmer==
Solomon was married in 1903 to Ada Fowler of the Kāi Tahu &quot;iwi&quot; and began learning the trade of sheep farmer first on leased land and then on the family holding which gradually increased in size as the other Moriori people died off. When his father and his wife died in 1915 Solomon was running 7000 sheep and a herd of cattle on the family farm. He remarried in 1916 to Whakarawa, the niece of his first wife and subsequently had five children. During the 1920s Solomon became known as one of the most successful farmers in the Chatham Islands. He took an active part in the social and political life of the Chatham Islands and was widely respected for his generosity and his conciliatory nature; it was as the &quot;last full-blooded Moriori&quot; however that he was best known.

==Family==
As the Kāi Tahu are a South Island Māori tribe rather than Moriori, Solomon&#x27;s children were considered of mixed descent. Modern scholars, however, reject the concept of a phylogenetically much distinct Moriori, and instead consider them a culturally distinct offshoot of an early (pre-Kāi Tahu) South Island Māori group, as evidenced by similarities between the Moriori language and the k-dialect of southern Māori. There are still many people of partial Moriori descent both in the Chatham Islands and in mainland New Zealand, and the Moriori are today generally considered a distinct &quot;cultural&quot; rather than racial entity.

==Death and legacy==
Solomon died of pneumonia and heart failure in 1933. Whati Tuuta, the son of his friend George Tuuta, built his coffin. In 1986, a statue was made to commemorate him; it can be found at Manukau close to his farm.

<text>Andrés García García (24 May 1941 – 4 April 2023) was a Dominican-born Mexican actor. He served as a scuba diving instructor in Acapulco. At the time of his death, he was one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Mexican cinema.

==Career==
García was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Spanish parents and later relocated to Mexico. He was the son of Spanish exiles from the Spanish Civil War who received refuge in the country during the regime of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo. His father was a Spanish Republican combat aviator named Andrés García La Calle.

García emigrated to Mexico, where he obtained Mexican nationality and pursued a career in show business. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he became a sex symbol in Mexico and the rest of Latin America, participating in movies, Spanish language soap operas and photo-romance novels (magazine featuring photos of actors who create a story—a popular phenomenon across Latin America during the 1970s).

In 1985 García starred in Mexican telenovela &quot;Tú o nadie&quot;, with Lucía Mendez and Salvador Pineda. &quot;Tú o nadie&quot; became a major hit and led to García receiving many international offers. He accepted an offer to go to Puerto Rico in 1986, where he acted in the soap operas &quot;Amame&quot;, with Johanna Rosaly, and &quot;Escándalo&quot;, with Iris Chacón and Charytín. &quot;Escándalo&quot; flopped, and the number of episodes recorded for that soap opera was cut in half by the television channel.

In 2005, García participated in a reality show titled &quot;El Principe Azul&quot; (meaning Prince Charming, though it literally means &quot;The Blue Prince&quot;), a show geared toward finding his son, Leonardo a girlfriend. García began to flirt with the young women on the show, going as far as having an on-camera kiss with one of the contestants, making his son grow frustrated, and eventually leave the show. Two previously unknown men were then cast to participate in the show and try to conquer one of the ladies involved in it. In 2006, he starred in the soap opera &quot;El Cuerpo del Deseo&quot;, broadcast by Telemundo International. The script of this telenovela is about transmigration, the passing of a soul into another body after death, coinciding with García&#x27;s beliefs on this subject.

==Personal life and death==
In September 2003, García made one of his several appearances on &quot;Cristina&quot;, the Spanish-language talk show hosted by Cristina Saralegui, to defend entertainers against paparazzi. He participated in over 50 different projects, including film, theater, soap opera and photo-opera work.

Andres Garcia married Sonia Infante in 1980 and divorced in 1992. He also married Sandra Vale.

García was also involved romantically, and remained friends, with Mexican model Carmen Campuzano and Puerto Rican singer Zeny, from the pop vocal duet Zeny &amp; Zory.

García died on 4 April 2023 in Acapulco, Mexico from complications of cirrhosis at the age of 81.

<text>Ramzi Ahmed Yousef (; born 27 April 1968) is a convicted Pakistani terrorist who was one of the main perpetrators and the mastermind behind the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the bombing of Philippine Airlines Flight 434; he was also a co-conspirator in the Bojinka plot. In 1995, he was arrested by the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and U.S. Diplomatic Security Service at a guest house in Islamabad, Pakistan, while trying to set a bomb in a doll, then extradited to the United States.

Yousef was tried in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York along with two co-conspirators and was convicted of planning the Bojinka plot. He received two life sentences plus 240 years for his part in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and Bojinka plot.

Yousef&#x27;s maternal uncle is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, with whom he allegedly planned the Bojinka plot. Mohammed is a senior al-Qaeda member accused of being the principal architect of the September 11 attacks in 2001. Yousef is serving his life sentences at ADX Florence, located near Florence, Colorado. He shared a cell block that is commonly referred to as &quot;Bombers&#x27; Row&quot; with Terry Nichols, Eric Rudolph, and Ted Kaczynski, before his transfer in late 2021. In 2007, Ramzi Yousef claimed to have found Jesus and converted to Christianity.

==Early life==
The name &quot;Ramzi Ahmed Yousef&quot; is a pseudonym. Yousef&#x27;s real name is assumed to be Abdul Basit Mahmoud Abdul Karim. He was born on 27 April 1968, in Kuwait to Pakistani parents.

His father is believed to be Mohammed Abdul Karim from Balochistan, Pakistan. His mother is believed to be the sister of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

In 1986, he enrolled at Swansea Institute in Wales, where he studied electrical engineering, graduating four years later. He also studied at the Oxford College of Further Education to improve his English.

Yousef left the United Kingdom after completing his studies and returned to Pakistan. He began to learn bomb making in a terrorist training camp in Peshawar, before traveling to the United States in 1992.

==1993 World Trade Center bombing==

The World Trade Center bombing was a terrorist attack that occurred on 26 February 1993, when a car bomb was detonated below Tower One of the World Trade Center in New York City, New York. The 1,500 lb (680 kg) urea nitrate-hydrogen gas enhanced device was intended to knock the North Tower (Tower 1) into the South Tower (Tower 2), to bring both towers down and kill thousands of people. It failed to do so, but killed six civilians and injured 1,042, including 919 civilians (including an EMS worker), 88 firefighters, and 35 police officers.

Ramzi Yousef sent a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot; after the bombing that expressed his motive: 
We are, the fifth battalion in the Liberation Army, declare our responsibility for the explosion on the mentioned building. This action was done in response for the American political, economical, and military support to Israel, the state of terrorism, and to the rest of the dictator countries in the region.

:Our Demands Are:

:1 – Stop all military, economical, and political aid to Israel.

:2 – All diplomatic relations with Israel must stop.

:3 – Not to interfere with any of the Middle East countries interior affairs.

If our demands are not met, all of our functional groups in the army will continue to execute our missions against the military and civilian targets in and out the United States. For your own information, our army has more than hundred and fifty suicidal soldiers ready to go ahead. The terrorism that Israel practices (which is supported by America) must be faced with a similar one. The dictatorship and terrorism (also supported by America) that some countries are practicing against their own people must also be faced with terrorism.

The American people must know, that their civilians who got killed are not better than those who are getting killed by the American weapons and support.

The American people are responsible for the actions of their government and they must question all of the crimes that their government is committing against other people. Or they — Americans — will be the targets of our operations that could diminish them.

===Arrival in United States===
On 1 September 1992, Yousef entered the United States with an Iraqi passport of disputed authenticity. His companion, Ahmed Ajaj, carried multiple immigration documents, among which was a crudely falsified Swedish passport. Providing a smokescreen to facilitate Yousef&#x27;s entry, Ajaj was arrested on the spot when immigration officials found bomb manuals, videotapes of suicide car bombers, and a cheat sheet on how to lie to U.S. immigration inspectors in his luggage. Directors of the American Counter-Terrorism program later tied the travel arrangements to a phone call from Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, an Egyptian militant Muslim preacher, to the Pakistani telephone number 810604.

Yousef was held for 72 hours and repeatedly interrogated, but INS holding cells were overcrowded. Yousef, requesting political asylum, was given a hearing date of 9 November 1992. He told Jersey City Police that he was Abdul Basit Mahmoud Abdul Karim, a Pakistani national born and brought up in Kuwait, and that he had lost his passport. On December 31, 1992, the Pakistani Consulate in New York issued a temporary passport to Abdul Basit Mahmud Abdul Karim (SAAG 484 2002).

Yousef traveled around New York and New Jersey, during which time he made calls to Abdel-Rahman via cell phone. Between 3 December and 27 December 1992, he made conference calls to key numbers in Balochistan, Pakistan (SAAG 484 2002).

Ajaj never reclaimed the manuals and tapes, which remained at the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) after Judge Reena Raggi had ordered the materials released in December 1992.

===Assembling the bomb===
Yousef, aided by Mohammed A. Salameh and Mahmud Abouhalima, began assembling the urea nitrate-fuel oil device in his Pamrapo Avenue home in Jersey City ready for delivery to the WTC on 26 February 1993. He ordered chemicals from his hospital room when he had been injured in a car crash, one of three accidents caused by Salameh in late 1992 and early in 1993.

Speaking in code by phone on 29 December 1992, Ajaj told Yousef that he had won release of the bomb manuals but warned Yousef that picking them up might jeopardize his &quot;business&quot;. On one book carried by Ajaj in 1992 was a word translated by the FBI as meaning &quot;the basic rule.&quot; It was later found to be &quot;al Qaeda&quot; – meaning &quot;the base.&quot;

During a CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview in 2002, co-conspirator Abdul Rahman Yasin said that Yousef originally wanted to bomb Jewish neighborhoods in New York City. Yasin added that after touring Crown Heights and Williamsburg, Yousef had changed his mind. Yasin alleged that Yousef was educated in bomb-making at a training camp in Peshawar, Pakistan.

===Explosion and aftermath===
Yousef rented a Ryder van and on 26 February 1993, loaded it with powerful explosives. He packed four cardboard boxes into the back of the van, each containing a mixture of paper bags, newspapers, urea, and nitric acid; next to them he placed three red metal cylinders of compressed hydrogen. Four large containers of nitroglycerin were loaded into the center of the van with Atlas Rockmaster blasting caps connected to each.

The van was driven into the garage of the World Trade Center, where it exploded. Using his Pakistani passport, Yousef escaped from the United States hours later. It is believed that he fled to Iraq and then Pakistan. As a result of the bombing, the FBI added Yousef as the 436th person on its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on 21 April 1993.

==1993 Benazir Bhutto assassination attempt==
After returning to Pakistan in February 1993, Yousef went into hiding. That summer, he allegedly took up a contract to assassinate the prime minister of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto, which was initiated by members of Sipah-e-Sahaba. The plot failed when Yousef and Abdul Hakim Murad were interrupted by police outside Bhutto&#x27;s residence. Yousef decided to abort the bombing and it blew up as he was trying to recover the device. He escaped and went into hiding during the investigation.

==1994 Philippine Airlines Flight 434 bombing==
On 11 December 1994, Yousef conducted a trial run of the plan by boarding Philippine Airlines Flight 434 from Manila to Tokyo, Japan, with a stopover in Cebu. An accomplished forger, Yousef created a counterfeit Italian passport with the identity Armaldo Forlani, an alteration of the name of the Italian prime minister Arnaldo Forlani, and booked the flight&#x27;s Manila-Cebu leg using the said name.

Yousef assembled a bomb in the lavatory, set the timer to detonate four hours later, and placed it in the life vest pouch under seat 26K on the right-hand side of the fuselage. The cabin crew of this leg, one of whom he asked permission to move to seat 26K, Maria Delacruz, had noticed that Yousef kept switching seats during the course of the flight, but did not warn the new cabin crew boarding at Cebu of his behavior, and only revealed about it to the investigators. Yousef and 25 other passengers left the plane at Cebu, where 256 passengers and a new cabin crew boarded for the trip to Tokyo. Many passengers were Japanese people; some were coworkers traveling as part of a tour group. Airport congestion delayed the departure of Flight 434 from Cebu for 38 minutes. All of the passengers had boarded by 8:30 a.m., with the bomb having been planted around two hours earlier. PAL 434 was cleared for takeoff at 8:38 a.m.

At 11:43 am, about an hour and a half from Tokyo, the bomb exploded while Flight 434 cruised on autopilot above the Japanese island of Minami Daitō (near Okinawa Island and approximately 260 miles (420 km) southwest of Tokyo). The explosion dismembered 24-year-old , a Japanese businessman occupying the seat where the bomb was placed. Ten passengers sitting in the seats in front of and behind Ikegami were also injured while one needed urgent medical care. The explosion tore out a two square-foot (0.2 m2) portion of the cabin floor into the cargo hold but leaving the fuselage of the plane intact. The airplane was spared from a deadly fiery explosion as the seat where the bomb was planted, 26K, was two rows away from the central fuel tank. The rapid expansion of energy from the bomb caused the plane to expand vertically slightly, damaging cables to the steering and aileron controls. The bomb&#x27;s orientation caused the energy to be mostly absorbed by Ikegami; he was killed but the other passengers and the plane were not catastrophically damaged.

The cockpit crew improvised to manipulate the plane&#x27;s speed and direction by varying the engines&#x27; throttle settings. Captain Eduardo Reyes made an emergency landing at Okinawa&#x27;s Naha Airport, saving 272 passengers and 20 crew. The aircraft became a crime scene under Japanese law; bomb fragments found in and around the blast zone, as well as the lower half of Ikegami&#x27;s body, provided clues pointing investigators back to Manila.

===Discovery by police===
Yousef then returned to Manila, where he began preparing at least a dozen bombs, each with more explosive materials. Weeks before his planned attacks, a fire started in his Manila apartment, forcing him to flee the room, leaving everything behind. The fire made the apartment staff suspicious, and soon police, led by Aida Fariscal, raided the apartment and uncovered the plot. A Philippine National Police raid in another Manila apartment revealed related evidence that Abdul Murad, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and Yousef had drawn up plans for flying an airplane into CIA headquarters. The information was passed on to the Federal Aviation Administration, who warned individual airlines.

==1994 Imam Reza shrine bombing==
==Bojinka plot==

After the Iranian shrine bombing, Yousef soon began planning the Bojinka plot. It included plans to assassinate Pope John Paul II while he visited the Philippines, and to plant bombs inside several United and Delta Air Lines flights out of Bangkok. On this plot, he allegedly worked with his maternal uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

==1995 U.S. airliner bombing attempt==
Despite the international manhunt, Yousef escaped from Manila to Pakistan. On 31 January 1995, he flew from Pakistan to Thailand and met with a South African associate Istaique Parker. Yousef told Parker to check two suitcases filled with bombs, one on a Delta Air Lines flight and another on a United Airlines flight. Both bombs were timed to blow up over populated areas of the U.S. Parker spent much of the day at the airport, but was reportedly too scared to approach the airlines with the suitcases. Finally, Parker returned to Yousef&#x27;s hotel and lied that employees at the airline cargo sections were asking for passports and fingerprints, making it too risky to go ahead with the plan.

Yousef, wanting to get the bombs on a plane bound for the U.S., called a friend with diplomatic immunity in Qatar who was willing to take the suitcases to London and check them on a flight to the U.S. The plan was that they would explode mid-flight and destroy the plane. Yousef planned to use the friend&#x27;s diplomatic immunity to ensure the suitcases would be loaded on the plane. According to Simon Reeve&#x27;s book &quot;The New Jackals&quot;, the name of this friend has not been revealed, but his father is said to be a very senior politician and leading member of the establishment in Qatar (at the time, Yousef&#x27;s maternal uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, was living in Qatar as the guest of a Qatari cabinet official). However, there was a problem and the suitcases were not checked in. Yousef and Parker returned to Pakistan on 2 February 1995.

==Arrest, conviction and prison life==

Following a tip-off from Istaique Parker, on 7 February 1995, agents of Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and special agents of the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service raided room #16 in the Su-Casa Guest House in Islamabad, Pakistan, and captured Yousef before he could move to Peshawar. Parker was paid $2 million under the Rewards for Justice Program for the information leading to Yousef&#x27;s capture. During the raid, agents found Delta and United Airlines flight schedules and bomb components in children&#x27;s toys. Yousef had chemical burns on his fingers. Yousef was sent to a federal prison in New York City and held there until his trial.

On 5 September 1996, Yousef and two co-conspirators were convicted for their role in the Bojinka plot and were sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Kevin Duffy to life in prison without parole.

On 12 November 1997, Yousef was found guilty of masterminding the 1993 bombing, and on 8 January 1998, Judge Duffy found Yousef guilty of plotting a &quot;seditious conspiracy&quot; to bomb the World Trade Center and sentenced Yousef to life plus 240 years in prison for both bombings. He also recommended that Yousef&#x27;s entire sentence be served in solitary confinement.

During the 1998 trial, Yousef said:
You keep talking also about collective punishment and killing innocent people to force governments to change their policies; you call this terrorism when someone would kill innocent people or civilians in order to force the government to change its policies. Well, when you were the first one who invented this terrorism. You were the first one who killed innocent people, and you are the first one who introduced this type of terrorism to the history of mankind when you dropped an atomic bomb which killed tens of thousands of women and children in Japan and when you killed over a hundred thousand people, most of them civilians, in Tokyo with fire bombings. You killed them by burning them to death. And you killed civilians in Vietnam with chemicals as with the so-called Orange agent. You killed civilians and innocent people, not soldiers, innocent people every single war you went. You went to wars more than any other country in this century, and then you have the nerve to talk about killing innocent people.And now you have invented new ways to kill innocent people. You have so-called economic embargo which kills nobody other than children and elderly people, and which other than Iraq you have been placing the economic embargo on Cuba and other countries for over 35 years. ... The Government in its summations and opening statement said that I was a terrorist. Yes, I am a terrorist and I am proud of it. And I support terrorism so long as it was against the United States Government and against Israel, because you are more than terrorists; you are the one who invented terrorism and using it every day. You are liars, butchers, and hypocrites.Duffy responded:

Ramzi Yousef, you claim to be an Islamic militant. Of all the persons killed or harmed in some way by the World Trade Center bomb, you cannot name one who was against you or your cause. You did not care, just so long as you left dead bodies and people hurt.

Ramzi Yousef, you are not fit to uphold Islam. Your God is death. Your God is not Allah ...

You weren&#x27;t seeking conversions. The only thing you wanted to do was to cause death. Your God is not Allah. You worship death and destruction. What you do, you do not for Allah; you do it only to satisfy your own twisted sense of ego.

You would have others believe that you are a soldier, but the attacks on civilization for which you stand convicted here were sneak attacks which sought to kill and maim totally innocent people ...

You, Ramzi Yousef, came to this country pretending to be an Islamic fundamentalist, but you cared little or nothing for Islam or the faith of the Muslims. Rather, you adored not Allah, but the evil that you yourself have become. And I must say that as an apostle of evil, you have been most effective.

Yousef is held at the high-security Supermax prison ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado. The handcuffs Ramzi Yousef wore when he was captured in Pakistan are displayed at the FBI Museum in Washington, D.C. His Federal Prisoner number is 03911–000.
==Connection to Osama bin Laden==
In 1997, Osama bin Laden said during an interview that he did not know Yousef, but claimed to know Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001 attacks as well as Yousef&#x27;s uncle. According to the 9/11 Commission, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said under interrogation that &quot;Yousef was not a member of al-Qaeda and that Yousef never met bin Laden.&quot; Some authors, however, have made note of a stronger link between Yousef and bin Laden.

== In popular culture ==
*Canadian actor and comedian Sam Kalilieh portrayed Ramzi Yousef in the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; Season 3: Episode 5 (2005) called &quot;Bomb on Board&quot;.

<text>Valerie Kathryn Harper (August 22, 1939 – August 30, 2019) was an American actress. She began her career as a dancer on Broadway, making her debut as a replacement in the musical &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. She is best remembered for her role as Rhoda Morgenstern on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (1970–1977) and its spinoff &quot;Rhoda&quot; (1974–1978). For her work on &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot;, she thrice received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, and later received the award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for &quot;Rhoda&quot;.

Her film appearances include roles in &quot;Freebie and the Bean&quot; (1974) and &quot;Chapter Two&quot; (1979), both of which garnered her Golden Globe Award nominations. 

From 1986 to 1987, Harper appeared as Valerie Hogan on the sitcom &quot;Valerie&quot;, from which she was fired after two seasons. Her character was killed off, and the show was retitled &quot;Valerie&#x27;s Family&quot; and eventually &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;. Actress Sandy Duncan was cast in a new role that served as a replacement for Harper&#x27;s character. 

Harper returned to stage work in her later career, appearing in several Broadway productions. In 2010, she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance as Tallulah Bankhead in the play &quot;Looped&quot;.

== Early life ==
Harper was born on August 22, 1939, in Suffern, New York, the daughter of Iva Mildred (née McConnell) and Howard Donald Harper. Her father was a traveling lighting salesman; her mother was born (and raised) in Dalmeny, Saskatchewan, before becoming a teacher and later training as a nurse. Her parents married in Alberta before her mother immigrated to the United States.
Harper was the middle child of three, between her sister Leanne and her brother Merrill, who later took the name &quot;Don&quot;. After her parents&#x27; divorce in 1957, she also had a half-sister, Virginia,
from her father&#x27;s second marriage to Angela Posillico (1933–1996).

She stated that her parents were expecting a boy. But after her arrival her first and middle names were derived from tennis players Valerie Scott and Kay Stammers who were victorious doubles partners at a tournament Harper&#x27;s father was attending the day she was born. Her father was of English and French ancestry and her mother was of French-Canadian, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry. Harper based her character Rhoda Morgenstern on her Italian-American stepmother and Penny Ann Green (née Joanna Greenberg), with whom she danced in the Broadway musical &quot;Wildcat&quot;. She was raised Catholic, although at an early age she quit the church.

Her family moved every two years due to her father&#x27;s work. Harper attended schools in South Orange, New Jersey; Pasadena, California; Monroe, Michigan; Ashland, Oregon; and Jersey City, New Jersey. When her family returned to Oregon, she stayed in the New York City area to study ballet. She attended Lincoln High School in Jersey City, New Jersey before graduating from the private Young Professionals School on West 56th Street, where classmates included Sal Mineo, Tuesday Weld, and Carol Lynley.

== Career ==
=== Broadway dancer and improv ===
Harper began her show business career as a dancer and chorus girl on Broadway, and went on to perform in several Broadway shows, some choreographed by Michael Kidd, including &quot;Wildcat&quot; (starring Lucille Ball), &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner,&quot; &quot;Take Me Along&quot; (starring Jackie Gleason), and &quot;Subways Are for Sleeping&quot;. She was also cast in the musical &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;, but was forced to leave rehearsals due to illness. She returned to Broadway in February 2010, playing Tallulah Bankhead in Matthew Lombardo&#x27;s &quot;Looped&quot; at the Lyceum Theatre.

Harper had bit parts in &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock!&quot; (1956) and the film version of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1959), where she played a Yokumberry Tonic wife. She broke into television on a 1963 episode of the soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot; (&quot;Zip Guns Can Kill&quot;), and was an extra in &quot;Love with the Proper Stranger&quot; (1963). She was in the ensemble cast of Paul Sills&#x27; Story Theatre and toured with Second City along with then-husband Richard Schaal, Linda Lavin, and others, later appearing in sketches on &quot;Playboy After Dark&quot; in 1969. She performed several characters in a comedy LP record, &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love the Whole World is Jewish&quot; (1965), which included the popular novelty single, &quot;The Ballad of Irving&quot;, a recitation by TV announcer Frank Gallop. Harper and Schaal moved to Los Angeles in 1968, and co-wrote an episode of &quot;Love, American Style&quot;.

=== Television and film ===
Richard Schaal and Harper wrote &quot;Love and the Visitor&quot; (1970) for &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, a TV romantic comedy series.

While doing theater in Los Angeles in 1970, Harper was spotted by casting agent Ethel Winant, who called her in to audition for the role of Rhoda Morgenstern on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. She co-starred there from 1970 to 1974, then starred in the spinoff series &quot;Rhoda&quot; (CBS 1974–1978) in which her character returned to New York City.

She won four Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for her work as Rhoda Morgenstern. The first season of &quot;Rhoda&quot; was released on DVD on April 21, 2009 by Shout! Factory.

Harper was nominated for a Golden Globe for &quot;New Star of the Year&quot; for her supporting role in &quot;Freebie and the Bean&quot; (1974), and was a guest star on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1976, its first season. She had a starring role in the suspense movie &quot;Night Terror&quot; (1977), playing a murder witness who&#x27;s pursued by the killer. She had a supporting role in the romantic comedy &quot;Chapter Two&quot; (1979), starring James Caan and Marsha Mason, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also starred as Maggie in a telefilm production of the Michael Cristofer play &quot;The Shadow Box&quot; (1980), directed by Paul Newman.

Harper returned to situation comedy in 1986 when she played family matriarch Valerie Hogan on the NBC series &quot;Valerie&quot;. Following a salary dispute with NBC and production company Lorimar in 1987, she was fired from the series at the end of its second season, and she sued NBC and Lorimar for breach of contract. Her claims against NBC were dismissed, but the jury found that Lorimar had wrongfully fired her and awarded her $1.4 million plus 12.5% of the show&#x27;s profits. The series continued without her, with the explanation that her character had died offscreen. In 1987, it was initially renamed &quot;Valerie&#x27;s Family&quot;, then &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;, as Harper was replaced by Sandy Duncan, who played her sister-in-law Sandy Hogan.

Harper appeared in various television films, including guest roles on such series as &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; (1996), &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1998) ,&quot;Sex and the City&quot; (1999), and &quot;That 70&#x27;s Show&quot; (2001).

In 2000, she reunited with Moore in &quot;Mary and Rhoda&quot;, a television film that reunited their characters in later life.

=== Later career ===

Harper was a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and ran for its presidency in 2001, losing to Melissa Gilbert. She served on SAG&#x27;s Hollywood board of directors.

In 2005–2006, Harper portrayed Golda Meir in a United States national tour of the one-woman drama &quot;Golda&#x27;s Balcony&quot;. A film of the production was released in 2007.

She played Tallulah Bankhead in the world-premiere production of Matthew Lombardo&#x27;s &quot;Looped&quot; at the Pasadena Playhouse from June 27 to August 3, 2008. The show moved to Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., in 2009. It then briefly ran on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre, from February 2010 (previews) through April 2010, for which Harper received a Tony Award nomination. She was to continue the role on a national tour beginning January 2013, but withdrew due to her health.

She played Claire Bremmer, aunt of Susan Delfino (Teri Hatcher), on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; in 2011.

On September 4, 2013, Harper was announced as a contestant for the 17th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnered with professional dancer Tristan MacManus. They were eliminated from the show on October 7, 2013.

Harper appeared as the character Wanda on the American comedy web television series &quot;Liza on Demand&quot;, in its July 11, 2018, episode: &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;.

=== Activism and charity work ===
In the 1970s, Harper was involved in the women&#x27;s liberation movement and was an advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment. With Dennis Weaver she co-founded L.I.F.E. (Love Is Feeding Everyone) in 1983, a charity that fed thousands of needy people in Los Angeles.

== Personal life ==
Harper&#x27;s NYC roommate was Arlene Golonka.&lt;ref name=&quot;outsider/lived-with-valerie-harper&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Harper married actor Richard Schaal in 1964. They divorced in 1978, after which she had a relationship with Peter Horton.&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/163765575&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She married Tony Cacciotti in 1987, after dating for seven years, and they adopted a daughter, Cristina. 

Despite playing Jewish characters such as Rhoda Morgenstern, Harper herself was not Jewish.

In 2014 Harper was on The Howard Stern Show and, while discussing her terminal illness, told Howard in private a secret code word that only the two of them would know, which could be used after her death to prove if psychics were real. This idea for a secret word was based on a pact Harry Houdini had made with his wife Bess where they promised each other that the first one to die would attempt to contact the surviving spouse from the afterlife, using a code the couple had created to verify any spiritualists or psychics claiming they had made contact. In December, 2024, magician and mentalist Oz Pearlman appeared on the Howard Stern Show and guessed that the word was &quot;curly.&quot;

== Illness and death ==
In 2009, Harper was diagnosed with lung cancer. She announced on March 6, 2013, that tests from a January hospital stay revealed she had leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a rare condition where cancer cells spread into the meninges, the membranes surrounding the brain. She explained her doctors had given her as little as three months to live. Although the disease was considered incurable, her doctors said they were treating her with chemotherapy to try to slow its progress.

In April 2014, Harper said she was responding well to the treatment. On July 30, 2015, she was hospitalized in Maine after falling unconscious, and taken via medevac to a larger hospital for further treatment. She was later discharged.

In 2016, Harper&#x27;s cancer treatment continued at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and she was well enough to appear in a short film, &quot;My Mom and the Girl&quot;, based on the experiences of director/writer Susie Singer Carter, whose mother has Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In September 2017, she said: &quot;People are saying, &#x27;She&#x27;s on her way to death and quickly&#x27;. Now it&#x27;s five years instead of three months... I&#x27;m going to fight this. I&#x27;m going to see a way.&quot; At the time, she was developing a television series with Carter.

By July 2019, she was on a regimen of &quot;a multitude of medications and chemotherapy drugs&quot; and was experiencing &quot;extreme physical and painful challenges&quot; that required &quot;around-the-clock, 24/7 care.&quot; Harper died on the morning of August 30, 2019, in Los Angeles.

Harper is buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="351504" wikidata="Q1541141" url="?curid=351504" title="Middle East Media Research Institute">
<text>The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), officially the Middle East Media and Research Institute, is an American non-profit press monitoring organization co-founded by Israeli ex-intelligence officer Yigal Carmon and Israeli-American political scientist Meyrav Wurmser in 1997.

Critics describe MEMRI as a strongly pro-Israel advocacy group that, in spite of describing itself as being &quot;independent&quot; and &quot;non-partisan&quot; in nature, aims to portray the Arab world and the Muslim world in a negative light by producing and disseminating incomplete or inaccurate translations of the original versions of the media reports that it re-publishes. It has also been accused of selectively focusing on the views of Islamic extremists while de-emphasizing or ignoring mainstream opinions.

==History==
The organization was co-founded by Yigal Carmon, an ex-Aman agent, and Meyrav Wurmser, a political scientist. It was incorporated in Washington, D.C., as the Middle East Media and Research Institute Inc. on December 1, 1997.

==Objectives==
The organization indirectly gained public prominence as a source of news and analysis about the Muslim world, following the September 11 attacks and the subsequent war on terror by the Bush administration. According to MEMRI, its translations and reports are distributed to &quot;congresspersons, congressional staff, policy makers, journalists, academics, and interested parties&quot;. According to Political Research Associates, MEMRI&#x27;s translated articles and its commentary are routinely cited in national media outlets in the United States, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, while analyses by MEMRI staff and officers are frequently published by right-wing and neoconservative media outlets such as &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;Fox News&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, and the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot;. Political Research Associates writes that both critics and supporters of MEMRI note its increasing influence in shaping perceptions of the Middle East. It has maintained longstanding relations with law enforcement agencies.

Concerning this change in their &#x27;mission statement,&#x27; Political Research Associates, which studies the US political right, notes that it occurred three weeks after the September 11 attacks, and considers MEMRI &quot;was previously more forthcoming about its political orientation in its self-description and in staff profiles on its website&quot;. Political Research Associates considers that &quot;MEMRI&#x27;s slogan, &#x27;Bridging the Language Gap Between the Middle East and the West,&#x27; does not convey the institute&#x27;s stridently pro-Israel and anti-Arab political bias.&quot; It further notes, that MEMRI&#x27;s founders, Wurmser and Carmon, &quot;are both hardline pro-Israel ideologues aligned with Israel&#x27;s Likud party&quot;. Carmon, in a public letter to Juan Cole that included a threat with a lawsuit over his comments on MEMRI, stated that he has never been affiliated with Likud. Cole answered that he had not alleged that, but that MEMRI would campaign for Likud goals such as the rejection of the Oslo peace process.

In 2012, &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported that Israeli intelligence agencies have reduced their monitoring the Palestinian media with MEMRI and Palestinian Media Watch now providing the Israeli government with coverage of &quot;anti-Israel incitement&quot; in social media, blogs and other online sources. The Prime Minister&#x27;s Bureau has stated that before the government cites information provided by the two sources, the source of the material and its credibility is confirmed.

=== Projects ===
MEMRI&#x27;s work is organized into projects, each with a specific focus. The main subjects the organization addresses are jihad and terrorism; relations between the U.S. and Middle East; pro-democracy and pro-civil rights views; inter-Arab relations; and anti-Semitism.

The Reform Project, according to MEMRI, focuses on monitoring, translating, and amplifying media from Muslim figures and movements with progressive viewpoints in the Arab and Muslim world. The project also aims to provide a platform for those sources to expand their reach. MEMRI has stated that this is the organization&#x27;s flagship project.

The MEMRI Lantos Archives on anti-Semitism and Holocaust Denial, a joint project with the Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice launched in 2009, is a repository of translated Arabic and Farsi material on anti-Semitism. The project is sponsored by the U.S. State Department. Through its translations and research, the project aims to document anti-Semitic trends in the Middle East and South Asia. The project provides policymakers with translations and footage of anti-Semitic comments made by media personalities, academics, and government and religious leaders. MEMRI holds an annual Capitol Hill gathering through the project, and publishes an annual report on anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial. The archives were named for Tom Lantos, the only Holocaust survivor to serve in United States Congress.

Arab and Iranian television programming is monitored, translated, and analyzed through the MEMRI TV Monitoring Project. The project&#x27;s translated video clips are available to the media and general public.

Activity by terrorist and violent extremist organizations is tracked through the Jihad and Terrorism Threat Monitor (JTTM). The project disseminates jihadi-associated social media content and propaganda released by various Islamic State media companies.

The organization&#x27;s Cyber and Jihad Lab (CJL) tracks cyberterrorism. According to MEMRI, the CJL&#x27;s goal is to inform and make recommendations to legislators and the business community about the threat of cyberterrorism. Initiatives have included encouraging social media companies to remove terrorist accounts and sought legislation to prevent terrorist entities from using their platforms.

MEMRI&#x27;s other projects include the Russian Media Studies Project, which translates Russian media and publishes reports analyzing Russian political ideology, the Iran Studies Project, the South Asia Studies Project, and the 9/11 Documentation Project.

==Financial aid==
MEMRI is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Despite MEMRI claiming to have a policy of not accepting money from governments, it has accepted grants from the US government, though MEMRI primarily relies on around 250 private donors, including other organizations and foundations.

MediaTransparency, an organization that monitors the financial ties of conservative think tanks to conservative foundations in the United States, reported that for the years 1999 to 2004, MEMRI received $100,000 from The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, Inc., $100,000 from The Randolph Foundation, and $5,000 from the John M. Olin Foundation.

MEMRI recognized US$6,292,683 of revenue and incurred US$6,247,476 of expenses during the twelve months ended June 30, 2018. Charity Navigator, an organization that evaluates the financial health of America&#x27;s largest charities, has given MEMRI three stars out of a possible four.

In August 2011, the United States Department of State&#x27;s Office of International Religious Freedom in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, awarded MEMRI a $200,000 grant.

==Reception==
The organization&#x27;s translations are regularly quoted by major international newspapers, and its work has generated strong criticism and praise. Critics have accused MEMRI of producing inaccurate, unreliable translations with undue emphasis and selectivity in translating and disseminating the most extreme views from Arabic and Persian media, which portray the Arab and Muslim world in a negative light, while ignoring moderate views that are often found in the same media outlets. Other critics charge that while MEMRI does sometimes translate pro-US or pro-democracy voices in the regional media, it systematically leaves out intelligent criticism of Western-style democracy, US and Israeli policy and secularism.

MEMRI&#x27;s work has been criticized on three grounds: that their work is biased; that they choose articles to translate selectively so as to give an unrepresentative view of the media they are reporting on; and that some of their translations are inaccurate. MEMRI has responded to the criticism, stating that their work is not biased; that they in fact choose representative articles from the Arab media that accurately reflect the opinions expressed, and that their translations are highly accurate.

===Accusations of pro-Israel bias===
Brian Whitaker, then the Middle East editor for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote in a public email debate with Carmon in 2003, that his problem with MEMRI was that it &quot;poses as a research institute when it&#x27;s basically a propaganda operation&quot;. Earlier, Whitaker had charged that MEMRI&#x27;s role was to &quot;further the political agenda of Israel.&quot; and that MEMRI&#x27;s website does not mention Carmon&#x27;s employment for Israeli intelligence, or Meyrav Wurmser&#x27;s political stance, which he described as an &quot;extreme brand of Zionism&quot;. However, Whitaker also wrote that &quot;nobody, so far as I know, disputes the general accuracy of Memri&#x27;s translations.&quot;

Carmon responded to this by stating that his employment history is not a secret and was not political, as he served under opposing administrations of the Israeli government and that perhaps the issue was that he was Israeli: &quot;If your complaint is that I am Israeli, then please say so.&quot; Carmon also questioned Whitaker&#x27;s own biases, wondering if Whitaker is biased in favor of Arabs – as his website on the Middle East is named &quot;Al-Bab&quot; (&quot;The Gateway&quot; in Arabic) – stating: &quot;I wonder how you would judge an editor whose website was called &quot;Ha-Sha-ar&quot; (&quot;The Gateway&quot; in Hebrew)?

In 2006, MEMRI released an interview with Norman Finkelstein on Lebanese Al Jadeed in which he discussed his book &quot;The Holocaust Industry&quot; which made it appear as if Finkelstein was questioning the death toll of the Holocaust. Finkelstein said in response that MEMRI edited the television interview he gave in order to falsely impute that he was a Holocaust denier. In an interview with the Muslim-American newspaper &quot;In Focus&quot; in 2007, he said MEMRI uses &quot;the same sort of propaganda techniques as the Nazis&quot; and &quot;take[s] things out of context in order to do personal and political harm to people they don&#x27;t like&quot;.

====Selective focus on Islamic extremists====
Several critics have accused MEMRI of selectivity. Juan Cole, a professor of Modern Middle East History at the University of Michigan, argues MEMRI has a tendency to &quot;cleverly cherry-pick the vast Arabic press, which serves 300 million people, for the most extreme and objectionable articles and editorials... On more than one occasion I have seen, say, a bigoted Arabic article translated by MEMRI and when I went to the source on the web, found that it was on the same op-ed page with other, moderate articles arguing for tolerance. These latter were not translated.&quot; Former head of the CIA&#x27;s counterintelligence unit, Vincent Cannistraro, said that MEMRI &quot;are selective and act as propagandists for their political point of view, which is the extreme-right of Likud. They simply don&#x27;t present the whole picture.&quot; Laila Lalami, writing in &quot;The Nation&quot;, states that MEMRI &quot;consistently picks the most violent, hateful rubbish it can find, translates it and distributes it in email newsletters to media and members of Congress in Washington.&quot; As a result, critics such as UK Labour politician Ken Livingstone state that MEMRI&#x27;s analyses are distortion.

Assaf David of the Truman Institute wrote that MEMRI distorts the Arab world by publishing the writings of extremists while ignoring moderates.

A report by Center for American Progress, titled &quot;Fear, Inc.: The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America&quot; lists MEMRI as promoting Islamophobic propaganda in the USA through supplying selective translations that are relied upon by several organisations &quot;to make the case that Islam is inherently violent and promotes extremism.&quot;

MEMRI argues that they are quoting the government-controlled press and not obscure or extremist publications, a fact their critics acknowledge, according to Marc Perelman: &quot;When we quote &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; in Egypt, it is as if we were quoting &quot;The New York Times&quot;. We know there are people questioning our work, probably those who have difficulties seeing the truth. But no one can show anything wrong about our translations.&quot;

In August 2013, the Islamic Da&#x27;wah Centre of South Australia questioned the &quot;reliability, independence and veracity&quot; of MEMRI after it posted what the Islamic Da&#x27;wah Centre called a &quot;sensational de-contextualised cut-and-paste video clip ... put together in a suggestive manner&quot; of a sermon by the Sheikh Sharif Hussein on an American website. According to the two-minute video, which was a heavily condensed version of the Sheikh&#x27;s 36-minute speech delivered in Adelaide on 22 March, Hussein called Australian and American soldiers &quot;Crusader pigs&quot; and stated &quot;O Allah, count the Buddhists and the Hindus one by one. O Allah, count them and kill them to the very last one.&quot; According to MEMRI&#x27;s translation, he also described U.S. President Barack Obama as an &quot;enemy of Allah, you who kiss the shoes and feet of the Jews&quot; and predicted that &quot;The day will come when you are trampled upon by the pure feet of the Muslims.&quot; MEMRI&#x27;s rendition moved Liberal senator Cory Bernardi to write to the Police Commissioner charging that under Australian anti-terrorism laws, the video clip was &quot;hate speech&quot;, and requesting that action be taken against Hussein. The South Australian Islamic Society and the Australian Buddhist Councils Federation also condemned Hussein&#x27;s speech. Widespread calls from the public for the deportation of Hussein and his family followed news reports of the video. A police spokeswoman stated &quot;Police will examine the entire content of the sermon to gain the full context and determine whether any crime has been committed.&quot; Hussein himself declined any comment on the contents of the video. However, the Da&#x27;wah Centre charged that by omitting the context of Hussein&#x27;s statements, MEMRI had distorted the actual intent of the speech. While admitting that the Sheikh was emotional and used strong words, the Centre stated that the speech was delivered in relation to rape cases in Iraq, the birth defects due to use of depleted uranium, and the Burmese Buddhist massacre. This, the Centre said, was omitted from the edited MEMRI video.

====Translation accuracy and controversy====

MEMRI&#x27;s translations are considered &quot;usually accurate&quot; though occasionally disputed and highly selective in what it chooses to translate and in which context it puts things, as in the case of MEMRI&#x27;s translation of a 2004 Osama bin Laden video, which MEMRI defended, which it said indicated that any individual US state that did not vote for President George W. Bush &quot;guarantees its own security,&quot; implying a threat against those states that did vote for him; outside translators, and the original article that the MEMRI alert claimed to correct, indicated that Bin Laden was threatening &quot;nations&quot;, not individual US states.

Following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, Al Jazeera invited Hani al-Sebai, an Islamist living in Britain, to take part in a discussion on the event. Al-Sibai is listed as a Specially Designated National by the US Treasury Department because of alleged support for al-Qaida. For one segment of the discussion in regard to the victims, MEMRI provided the following translation of al-Sebai&#x27;s words:

Al-Sebai subsequently claimed that MEMRI had mistranslated his interview, and that among other errors, he had actually said:

By leaving out the condemnation of the &quot;killing of innocents&quot; entirely, Mohammed El Oifi, writing in &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;, argued that this translation left the implication that civilians (the innocent) are considered a legitimate target. Several British newspapers subsequently used MEMRI&#x27;s translation to run headlines such as &quot;Islamic radical has praised the suicide bomb attacks on the capital&quot; prompting al-Sebai to demand an apology and take legal action. In his view, MEMRI&#x27;s translation was also &quot;an incitement to have me arrested by the British authorities&quot;.

Halim Barakat described MEMRI as &quot;a propaganda organization dedicated to representing Arabs and Muslims as anti-Semites&quot;. Barakat claims an essay he wrote for the Al-Hayat Daily of London titled &quot;The Wild Beast that Zionism Created: Self-Destruction&quot;, was mistranslated by MEMRI and retitled as &quot;Jews Have Lost Their Humanity&quot;. Barakat further stated &quot;Every time I wrote &#x27;Zionism&#x27;, MEMRI replaced the word by &#x27;Jew&#x27; or &#x27;Judaism&#x27;. They want to give the impression that I&#x27;m not criticizing Israeli policy, but that what I&#x27;m saying is anti-Semitic.&quot; According to Barakat, he was subject to widespread condemnation from faculty and his office was &quot;flooded with hatemail&quot;. Fellow Georgetown faculty member Aviel Roshwald accused Barakat in an article he published of promoting a &quot;demonization of Israel and of Jews&quot;. Supported by Georgetown colleagues, Barakat denied the claim, which Roshwald had based on MEMRI&#x27;s translation of Barakat&#x27;s essay.

In 2007, CNN correspondent Atika Shubert and Arabic translators accused MEMRI of mistranslating portions of a Palestinian children&#x27;s television program:

Naomi Sakr, a professor of Media Policy at the University of Westminster has charged that specific MEMRI mistranslations, occurring during times of international tension, have generated hostility towards Arab journalists.

In an email debate with Carmon, Whitaker asked about MEMRI&#x27;s November 2000 translation of an interview given by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to Al-Ahram al-Arabi. One question asked by the interviewer was: &quot;How do you deal with the Jews who are besieging al-Aqsa and are scattered around it?&quot; which was translated as: &quot;How do you feel about the Jews?&quot; MEMRI cut out the first part of the reply and combined it with the answer to the next question, which, Whitaker claimed, made &quot;Arabs look more anti-Semitic than they are&quot;. Carmon admitted this was an error in translation but defended combining the two replies, as both questions referred to the same subject. Carmon rejected other claims of distortion by Whitaker, saying: &quot;it is perhaps reassuring that you had to go back so far to find a mistake ... You accused us of distortion by omission but when asked to provide examples of trends and views we have missed, you have failed to answer.&quot; Carmon also accused Whitaker of &quot;using insults rather than evidence&quot; in his criticism of MEMRI.

In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;no one disputes their translations.&quot;

====Response by MEMRI====
MEMRI responds to criticism by saying that the media had a tendency to whitewash statements of Arab leaders, and regularly defends its translations as being representative of actual ME viewpoints, even when the translations themselves are disputed: &quot;MEMRI has never claimed to &#x27;represent the view of the Arabic media&#x27;, but rather to reflect, through our translations, general trends which are widespread and topical.&quot;

===Positive reception===
In 2003 John Lloyd defended MEMRI in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;:

In a 2005 piece Thomas Friedman, a political opinion columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised MEMRI, and credited MEMRI with helping to &quot;shine a spotlight on hate speech wherever it appears&quot;. Friedman has written in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;what I respect about Memri is that it translates not only the ugly stuff but the courageous liberal, reformist Arab commentators as well.&quot; In addition, he has cited MEMRI&#x27;s translations in his op-eds.

In 2002 Brit Hume of Fox News said, &quot;These people tell you what&#x27;s going on in pulpits and in the state-controlled TV. If you have indoctrination, it&#x27;s important to know about it.&quot;

<text>Aliyah (, ; &quot;ʿălīyyā&quot;, ) is the immigration of Jews from the diaspora to, historically, the geographical Land of Israel or the Palestine region, which is today chiefly represented by the State of Israel. Traditionally described as &quot;the act of going up&quot; (towards the Jewish holy city of Jerusalem), moving to the Land of Israel or &quot;making aliyah&quot; is one of the most basic tenets of Zionism. The opposite action – emigration by Jews from the Land of Israel – is referred to in the Hebrew language as &quot;yerida&quot; (). The Law of Return that was passed by the Israeli parliament in 1950 gives all diaspora Jews, as well as their children and grandchildren, the right to relocate to Israel and acquire Israeli citizenship on the basis of connecting to their Jewish identity.

For much of their history, most Jews have lived in the diaspora outside of the Land of Israel due to various historical conflicts that led to their persecution alongside multiple instances of expulsions and exoduses. In the late 19th century, 99.7% of the world&#x27;s Jews lived outside the region, with Jews representing 2–5% of the population of the Palestine region. Despite its historical value as a national aspiration for the Jewish people, aliyah was acted upon by few prior to the rise of a national awakening among Jews worldwide and the subsequent development of the Zionist movement in the late 19th century; the large-scale immigration of Jews to Palestine had consequently begun by 1882. Since the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948, more than 3 million Jews have made aliyah. , Israel and the Israeli-occupied territories contain approximately 42.9 percent of the world&#x27;s Jewish population.

==Terminology==

The Hebrew word &quot;aliyah&quot; means &quot;ascent&quot; or &quot;going up&quot;. Jewish tradition views traveling to the Land of Israel as an ascent, both geographically and metaphysically. In one opinion, the geographical sense preceded the metaphorical one, as most Jews going on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, which is situated at approximately 750 meters (2,500 feet) above sea level, had to climb to a higher geographic elevation. The reason is that many Jews in early rabbinic times used to live either in Egypt&#x27;s Nile Delta and on the plains of Babylonia, which lay relatively low; or somewhere in the Mediterranean Basin, from where they arrived by ship.

It is noteworthy that various references in the earlier books of the Bible indicate that Egypt was considered as being &quot;below&quot; other countries, so that going to Egypt was described as &quot;going down to Egypt&quot; while going away from Egypt (including Hebrews going out of Egypt to Canaan) was &quot;going up out of Egypt&quot;. Thus, in the Book of Genesis 46 God speaks to Jacob and says “Do not be afraid to &quot;go down&quot; to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. I will &quot;go down&quot; to Egypt with you.&quot; And in the Book of Exodus 1, the oppressive new King of Egypt suspects the Hebrews of living in Egypt of being enemies who in time of war might &quot;Fight against us, and so get them &quot;up&quot; out of the land&quot;.
Widespread use of the term &quot;Aliyah&quot; to describe ideologically inspired Jewish immigration to Palestine / Israel is due to Arthur Ruppin&#x27;s 1930 work . &quot;Aliyah&quot; has also been defined, by sociologists such as Aryeh Tartakower, as immigration for the good of the community, regardless of the destination.

&quot;Aliyah&quot; is an important Jewish cultural concept and a fundamental component of Zionism. It is enshrined in Israel&#x27;s Law of Return, which accords any Jew (deemed as such by halakha and/or Israeli secular law) and eligible non-Jews (a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew), the legal right to assisted immigration and settlement in Israel, as well as Israeli citizenship. Someone who &quot;makes &quot;aliyah&quot;&quot; is called an &quot;oleh&quot; (m.; pl. &quot;olim&quot;) or &quot;olah&quot; (f.; pl. &quot;olot&quot;). Many religious Jews espouse &quot;aliyah&quot; as a return to the Promised Land, and regard it as the fulfillment of God&#x27;s biblical promise to the descendants of the Hebrew patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Nachmanides (the Ramban) includes making aliyah in his enumeration of the 613 commandments.

Sifre says that the &quot;mitzvah&quot; (commandment) of living in Eretz Yisrael is as important as all the other &quot;mitzvot&quot; put together. There are many &quot;mitzvot&quot; such as shmita, the sabbatical year for farming, which can only be performed in Israel.

For generations of religious Jews, &quot;aliyah&quot; was associated with the coming of the Jewish Messiah. Jews prayed for their Messiah to come, who was to redeem the &quot;Land of Israel&quot; (&quot;Eretz Yisrael&quot;, commonly known in English as the region of Palestine) from gentile rule and return world Jewry to the land under a Halachic theocracy.

In Zionist discourse, the term &quot;aliyah&quot; (plural &quot;aliyot&quot;) includes both voluntary immigration for ideological, emotional, or practical reasons and, on the other hand, mass flight of persecuted populations of Jews. The vast majority of Israeli Jews today trace their family&#x27;s recent roots to outside the country. While many have actively chosen to settle in Israel rather than some other country, many had little or no choice about leaving their previous home countries. While Israel is commonly recognized as &quot;a country of immigrants&quot;, it is also, in large measure, a country of refugees, including internal refugees. Israeli citizens who marry individuals of Palestinian heritage, born within the Israeli-occupied territories and carrying Palestinian IDs, must renounce Israeli residency themselves in order to live and travel together with their spouses.

==Pre-modern aliyah==

===Biblical===
The Hebrew Bible relates that the patriarch Abraham came to the Land of Canaan with his family and followers in approximately 1800 BC. His grandson Jacob went down to Egypt with his family, and after several centuries there, the Israelites went back to Canaan under Moses and Joshua, entering it in about 1300 BC.

===Antiquity===
In Zionist historiography, post the Balfour Declaration and the start of the &quot;Third Aliyah&quot;, the &quot;First Aliyah&quot; and &quot;Second Aliyah&quot; originally referred to the two Biblical &quot;returns to Zion&quot; described in Ezra–Nehemiah – the &quot;First Aliya&quot; led by Zerubbabel, and the &quot;Second Aliya&quot; led by Ezra and Nehemiah approximately 80 years later. A few decades after the fall of the Kingdom of Judah and the Babylonian exile of the Jewish people, approximately 50,000 Jews returned to Zion following the Cyrus Declaration from 538 BC. The Jewish priestly scribe Ezra led the Jewish exiles living in Babylon to their home city of Jerusalem in 459 BC. Even those Jews who did not end up returning gave their children names like Yashuv-Tzadik and Yaeliyahu which testified to their desire to return.

Jews returned to the Land of Israel throughout the Second Temple period. Herod the Great also encouraged aliyah and often gave key posts, such as the position of High Priest, to returnees.

In late antiquity, the two hubs of rabbinic learning were Babylonia and the land of Israel. Throughout the Amoraic period, many Babylonian Jews immigrated to the land of Israel and left their mark on life there, as rabbis and leaders.

===Middle Ages===

In the 10th century, leaders of the Karaite Jewish community, mostly living under Persian rule, urged their followers to settle in Eretz Yisrael. The Karaites established their own quarter in Jerusalem, on the western slope of the Kidron Valley. During this period, there is abundant evidence of pilgrimages to Jerusalem by Jews from various countries, mainly in the month of Tishrei, around the time of the Sukkot holiday.

The number of Jews migrating to the land of Israel rose significantly between the 13th and 19th centuries, mainly due to a general decline in the status of Jews across Europe and an increase in religious persecution. The expulsion of Jews from England (1290), France (1391), Austria (1421), and Spain (the Alhambra decree of 1492) were seen by many as a sign of approaching redemption and contributed greatly to the messianic spirit of the time.

Aliyah was also spurred during this period by the resurgence of messianic fervor among the Jews of France, Italy, the Germanic states, Poland, Russia, and North Africa. The belief in the imminent coming of the Jewish Messiah, the ingathering of the exiles and the re-establishment of the kingdom of Israel encouraged many who had few other options to make the perilous journey to the land of Israel.

Pre-Zionist resettlement in Palestine met with various degrees of success. In 1211, the &quot;aliyah of the three hundred rabbis&quot; saw notable French and German Tosafists such as Samson of Coucy, Joseph ben Baruch, Baruch ben Isaac and Samson ben Abraham of Sens, along with their colleagues and students, emigrate to Palestine, as recorded in the &quot;Shebet Yehudah&quot;. There is doubt about the accuracy of the account, as there is no evidence that there were actually 300 immigrants, and that number is likely exaggerated. It also mentions Jonathan ben David ha-Cohen emigrating there, but he died in 1205, and was said to have celebrated Purim in Palestine in 1210. Little is known of the fate of their descendants. It is thought that few survived the bloody upheavals caused by the Crusader invasion in 1229 and their subsequent expulsion by the Muslims in 1291. After the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 and the expulsion of Jews from Spain (1492) and Portugal (1498), many Jews made their way to the Holy Land.

Samson b. Abraham of Sens, who emigrated in 1211, wrote in his responsa that the biblical commandment to go to Eretz Yisrael was nullified due to &quot;pikuach nefesh&quot;, or saving a life, citing the danger of the journey, particularly for pregnant women. Haim ben Hananel HaCohen ruled that the commandment was negated altogether. Moses ben Joseph di Trani, born in Salonika in 1490, made aliyah and became the rabbi of Safed, where he died in 1580. In his writings, Trani disagreed with Haim Cohen, and argued that it was not dangerous to travel to Palestine due to the peace between &quot;Edom&quot; (Christian Europe) and &quot;Ishmael&quot; (Islamic/Arab world) at the time. David ibn Zimri, known as the Radbaz, also went to Palestine where he died in 1574. The Radbaz reconciled Maimonides&#x27; brief journey to Jerusalem in 1165, but ultimate settlement in Egypt, despite Maimonides&#x27; belief that it was commanded to settle in Eretz Yisrael and forbidden to remain in Egypt, that he had been compelled to remain by the authorities, as physician to the sultan. Ishtori Haparchi, who was a geographer of Palestine, said that Maimonides signed letters as &quot;the writer who transgresses three negative commandments every day,&quot; though no surviving responsa with Maimonides&#x27; autograph are found bearing this.

Notable rabbi Nahmanides went to Jerusalem a few years before his death in 1267. Isaiah Horowitz made aliyah in 1621. Nahmanides, in his gloss on Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Book of Commandments&quot;, articulated that contrary to Rashi&#x27;s interpretation, settling Eretz Yisrael was a divine commandment and not simply a promise, arguing that the Torah commanded the people of Israel to conquer and possess the Holy Land. Though he spent most of his life in Gerona, he went to Palestine without his wife and children and died in 1270. It not known why his family did not join him.

In 1541, following their expulsion from Naples, some Jews emigrated to Palestine. In the 1560s, Gracia Mendes and Joseph Nasi obtained a concession from the sultan to permit Jews to settle in Safed and Tiberias.

Some Ukrainian Jewish refugees fleeing the pogroms of the Khmelnytsky Uprising of the mid-17th century also settled in the Holy Land. Then the immigration in the 18th and early 19th centuries of thousands of followers of various Kabbalist and Hassidic rabbis, as well as the disciples of the Vilna Gaon and the disciples of the Chattam Sofer, added considerably to the Jewish populations in Jerusalem, Tiberias, Hebron, and Safed.

=== 18th century ===

The 1700 immigration associated with messianic Sabbateanism is considered the first modern mass movement of Jewish immigrants to Israel. Also in 1700, Judah HeHasid and his followers settled in Jerusalem, and Hayyim ben Jacob Abulafia and his followers in Tiberias. HeHasid&#x27;s Hurva Synagogue (or &quot;ruined synagogue&quot;), rebuilt on the ruins of a 15th century synagogue, was again destroyed in 1720.

A notable emigration of about 300 Hasidic immigrants led by Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk and Abraham Kalisker in 1777 aimed to establish a religious center. They were preceded by Nachman of Horodenka, Abraham Gershon of Kitov and Menahem Mendel of Premyshlan in 1764, members of the circle of the Baal Shem Tov.

===19th century===
The messianic dreams of the Gaon of Vilna inspired one of the largest pre-Zionist waves of immigration to Eretz Yisrael. In 1808 hundreds of the Gaon&#x27;s disciples, known as Perushim, settled in Tiberias and Safed, and later formed the core of the Old Yishuv in Jerusalem. This was part of a larger movement of thousands of Jews from countries as widely spaced as Persia and Morocco, Yemen and Russia, who moved to Palestine beginning in the first decade of the nineteenth century – and in even larger numbers after the conquest of the region by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1832 – all drawn by the expectation of the arrival of the Messiah in the Jewish year 5600, Christian year 1840, a movement documented in Arie Morgenstern&#x27;s &quot;Hastening Redemption&quot;. There were also those who like the British mystic Laurence Oliphant tried to lease Northern Palestine to settle the Jews there (1879).

Jewish immigration to Palestine began in earnest following the 1839 Tanzimat reforms; between 1840 and 1880, the Jewish population of Palestine rose from 9,000 to 23,000.

==Zionist aliyah (19th c.)==

In Zionist history, the different waves of &quot;aliyah&quot;, beginning with the arrival of the &quot;Biluim&quot; from Russia in 1882, are categorized by date and the country of origin of the immigrants. In 1872 colonies were established at Petah Tikva and Rosh Pinna. Jewish settlement in Jaffa may be dated to 1820, when Isaiah Ajiman moved there from Istanbul. Mikveh Israel agricultural school was established in 1870. Ajiman, a merchant, was executed in 1826, marking a decline in the status of Ottoman Jews.

In the late 19th century, 99.7% of the world&#x27;s Jews lived outside the region, with Jews representing 2–5% of the population of the Palestine region.

Pre-19th century small-scale return migration of Diaspora Jews to the Land of Israel is characterized as the Pre-Modern Aliyah. Since the birth of Zionism in the late 19th century, the advocates of aliyah have striven to facilitate the settlement of Jewish refugees in Ottoman Palestine, Mandatory Palestine, and the sovereign State of Israel.

The periodization of historical waves of Aliyah was first published after the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which created expectations of the start of a huge wave of immigration dubbed the &quot;Third Aliyah&quot;, in contrast to the Biblical &quot;First Aliyah&quot; and &quot;Second Aliyah&quot; &quot;returns to Zion&quot; described in Ezra–Nehemiah. Over the next two years, discussion in Zionist literature transformed the two prior to refer to the contemporary immigration waves at the end of the 19th century and the early 20th. These periods as per the modern convention were first published in October 1919 by Yosef Haim Brenner.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Zionist historians began to divide the next periods of immigration to Palestine into different phases, in a form which &quot;created and presumed the unique traits of aliyah and the Zionist enterprise&quot;. The currently accepted five-wave periodization was first published in Hebrew by sociologist David Gurevich in his 1944 work &quot;The Jewish Population of Palestine: Immigration, Demographic Structure and Natural Growth&quot;: the First Aliyah and the Second Aliyah to Ottoman Palestine, followed by the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Aliyah to Mandatory Palestine. Following Ruppin and Jacob Lestschinsky before him, Gurevich&#x27;s use of the term Aliyah emphasized the ideological element of the immigration, despite the fact that such a motivation was not representative of the immigrants as a whole.

Subsequently, named periods include Aliyah Bet (immigration done in spite of restrictive Mandatory law) between 1934 and 1948 and the Bricha of the Holocaust survivors; the aliyah from elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa as well as the aliyah from Western and Communist countries following the Six-Day War with the 1968 Polish political crisis, as well as the aliyah from post-Soviet states in the 1990s. Today, most aliyah consists of voluntary migration for ideological, economic, or family reunification purposes. Because Jewish lineage can provide a right to Israeli citizenship, &quot;aliyah&quot; (returning to Israel) has both a secular and a religious significance.

The first modern period of immigration to receive a number in common speech was the Third Aliyah, which in the World War I period was referred to as the successor to the First and Second Aliyot from Babylonia in the Biblical period. Reference to earlier modern periods as the First and Second Aliyot appeared first in 1919 and took a while to catch on.

===Ottoman Palestine (1881–1914)===
The pronounced persecution of Russian Jews between 1881 and 1910 led to a large wave of emigration. Since only a small portion of East European Jews had adopted Zionism by then, between 1881 and 1914 only 30–40,000 emigrants went to Ottoman Palestine, while over one and a half million Russian Jews and 300,000 from Austria-Hungary reached Northern America.

====First Aliyah (1882–1903)====
Between 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews immigrated to the Ottoman Palestine, joining the pre-existing Jewish population which in 1880 numbered 20,000-25,000. The Jews immigrating arrived in groups that had been assembled, or recruited. Most of these groups had been arranged in the areas of Romania and Russia in the 1880s. The migration of Jews from Russia correlates with the end of the Russian pogroms, with about 3 percent of Jews emigrating from Europe to Palestine. The groups who arrived in Palestine around this time were called &quot;Hibbat Tsiyon&quot;, which is a Hebrew word meaning &quot;fondness for Zion.&quot; They were also called &quot;Hovevei Tsiyon&quot; or &quot;enthusiasts for Zion&quot; by the members of the groups themselves. While these groups expressed interest and &quot;fondness&quot; for Palestine, they were not strong enough in number to encompass an entire mass movement as would appear later on in other waves of migration. The majority, belonging to the Hovevei Zion and Bilu movements, came from the Russian Empire with a smaller number arriving from Yemen. Many established agricultural communities. Among the towns that these individuals established are Petah Tikva (already in 1878), Rishon LeZion, Rosh Pinna, and Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov. In 1882 the Yemenite Jews settled in the Arab village of Silwan located south-east of the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem on the slopes of the Mount of Olives. Kurdish Jews settled in Jerusalem starting around 1895.

====Second Aliyah (1904–1914)====

Between 1904 and 1914, 35–40,000 Jews immigrated to Ottoman Palestine. The vast majority came from the Russian Empire, in particular from the Pale of Settlement in Eastern Europe. Jews from other countries in Eastern Europe such as Romania and Bulgaria also joined. Jewish emigration from Eastern Europe was largely due to pogroms and outbreaks of anti-Semitism there. However, Mountain Jews from the Caucasus and Jews from other countries including Yemen, Iran, and Argentina also arrived at this time. The Eastern European Jewish immigrants of this period, greatly influenced by socialist ideals, established the first kibbutz, Degania Alef, in 1909 and formed self-defense organizations, such as Hashomer, to counter increasing Arab hostility and to help Jews to protect their communities from Arab marauders. Ahuzat Bayit, a new suburb of Jaffa established in 1909, eventually grew to become the city of Tel Aviv. During this period, some of the underpinnings of an independent nation-state arose: Hebrew, the ancient national language, was revived as a spoken language; newspapers and literature written in Hebrew were published; political parties and workers organizations were established. The First World War effectively ended the period of the Second Aliyah.
It is estimated that over half of those who arrived during this period ended up leaving; Ben Gurion stated that nine out of ten left.

===British Palestine (1919–1948)===
====Third Aliyah (1919–1923)====
Between 1919 and 1923, 40,000 Jews, mainly from Eastern Europe, arrived in the wake of World War I. The British occupation of Palestine and the establishment of the British Mandate created the conditions for the implementation of the promises contained in the Balfour Declaration. Many of the Jewish immigrants were ideologically driven pioneers, known as &quot;halutzim&quot;, trained in agriculture and capable of establishing self-sustaining economies. In spite of immigration quotas established by the British administration, the Jewish population reached 90,000 by the end of this period. The Jezreel Valley and the Hefer Plain marshes were drained and converted to agricultural use. Additional national institutions arose such as the Histadrut (General Labor Federation); an elected assembly; national council; and the Haganah, the forerunner of the Israel Defense Forces.

====Fourth Aliyah (1924–1929)====
Between 1924 and 1929, 82,000 Jews arrived, many as a result of increasing anti-Semitism in Poland and throughout Europe. The vast majority of Jewish immigrants arrived from Europe mostly from Poland, the Soviet Union, Romania, and Lithuania, but about 12% came from Asia, mostly Yemen and Iraq. The immigration quotas of the United States kept Jews out. This group contained many middle-class families that moved to the growing towns, establishing small businesses, and light industry. Of these approximately 23,000 left the country.

====Fifth Aliyah (1929–1939)====
Between 1929 and 1939, with the rise of Nazism in Germany, a new wave of 250,000 immigrants arrived; the majority of these, 174,000, arrived between 1933 and 1936, after which increasing restrictions on immigration by the British made immigration clandestine and illegal, called &quot;Aliyah Bet&quot;. The Fifth Aliyah was again driven almost entirely from Europe, mostly from Central Europe (particularly from Poland, Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia), but also from Greece. Some Jewish immigrants also came from other countries such as Turkey, Iran, and Yemen. The Fifth Aliyah contained large numbers of professionals, doctors, lawyers, and professors, from Germany. Refugee architects and musicians introduced the Bauhaus style (the White City of Tel Aviv has the highest concentration of International Style architecture in the world with a strong element of Bauhaus) and founded the Palestine Philharmonic Orchestra. With the completion of the port at Haifa and its oil refineries, significant industry was added to the predominantly agricultural economy. The Jewish population reached 450,000 by 1940.

At the same time, tensions between Arabs and Jews grew during this period, leading to a series of Arab riots against the Jews in 1929 that left many dead and resulted in the depopulation of the Jewish community in Hebron. This was followed by more violence during the &quot;Great Uprising&quot; of 1936–1939. In response to the ever-increasing tension between the Arabic and Jewish communities married with the various commitments the British faced at the dawn of World War II, the British issued the White Paper of 1939, which severely restricted Jewish immigration to 75,000 people for five years. This served to create a &quot;relatively&quot; peaceful eight years in Palestine while the Holocaust unfolded in Europe.

Shortly after their rise to power, the Nazis negotiated the Ha&#x27;avara or &quot;Transfer&quot; Agreement with the Jewish Agency under which 50,000 German Jews and $100 million worth of their assets would be moved to Palestine.

====Aliyah Bet: Illegal immigration (1933–1948)====

The British government limited Jewish immigration to Mandatory Palestine with quotas, and following the rise of Nazism to power in Germany, illegal immigration to Mandatory Palestine commenced. The illegal immigration was known as &quot;Aliyah Bet&quot; (&quot;secondary immigration&quot;), or &quot;Ha&#x27;apalah&quot;, and was organized by the Mossad Le&#x27;aliyah Bet, as well as by the Irgun. Immigration was done mainly by sea, and to a lesser extent overland through Iraq and Syria. During World War II and the years that followed until independence, &quot;Aliyah Bet&quot; became the main form of Jewish immigration to Mandatory Palestine.

Following the war, Bricha (&quot;escape&quot;), an organization of former partisans and ghetto fighters was primarily responsible for smuggling Jews from Eastern Europe through Poland. In 1946 Poland was the only Eastern Bloc country to allow free Jewish aliyah to Mandate Palestine without visas or exit permits. By contrast, Stalin forcibly brought Soviet Jews back to USSR, as agreed by the Allies during the Yalta Conference. The refugees were sent to the Italian ports from which they traveled to Mandatory Palestine. More than 4,500 survivors left the French port of Sète aboard &quot;President Warfield&quot; (renamed &quot;Exodus&quot;). The British turned them back to France from Haifa, and forced them ashore in Hamburg. Despite British efforts to curb the illegal immigration, during the 14 years of its operation, 110,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine. In 1945 reports of the Holocaust with its 6 million Jewish killed, caused many Jews in Palestine to turn openly against the British Mandate, and illegal immigration escalated rapidly as many Holocaust survivors joined the aliyah.

===Early statehood (1948–1960)===


After Aliyah Bet, the process of numbering or naming individual aliyot ceased, but immigration did not. A major wave of Jewish immigration, mainly from post-Holocaust Europe and the Arab and Muslim world took place from 1948 to 1951. In three and a half years, the Jewish population of Israel, which was 650,000 at the state&#x27;s founding, was more than doubled by an influx of about 688,000 immigrants. In 1949, the largest-ever number of Jewish immigrants in a single year—249,954—arrived in Israel. This period of immigration is often termed &quot;kibbutz galuyot&quot; (literally, ingathering of exiles), due to the large number of Jewish diaspora communities that made aliyah. However, &quot;kibbutz galuyot&quot; can also refer to aliyah in general.

At the beginning of the immigration wave, most of the immigrants to reach Israel were Holocaust survivors from Europe, including many from displaced persons camps in Germany, Austria, and Italy, and from British detention camps on Cyprus. Large sections of shattered Jewish communities throughout Europe, such as those from Poland and Romania also immigrated to Israel, with some communities, such as those from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, being almost entirely transferred. At the same time, the number of Jewish immigrants from Arab countries greatly increased. Special operations were undertaken to evacuate Jewish communities perceived to be in serious danger to Israel, such as Operation Magic Carpet, which evacuated almost the entire Jewish population of Yemen, and Operation Ezra and Nehemiah, which airlifted most of the Jews of Iraq to Israel. Egyptian Jews were smuggled to Israel in Operation Goshen. Nearly the entire Jewish population of Libya left for Israel around this time, and clandestine aliyah from Syria took place, as the Syrian government prohibited Jewish emigration, in a process that was to last decades. Israel also saw significant immigration of Jews from non-Arab Muslim countries such as Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan in this period.

This resulted in a period of austerity. To ensure that Israel, which at that time had a small economy and scant foreign currency reserves, could provide for the immigrants, a strict regime of rationing was put in place. Measures were enacted to ensure that all Israeli citizens had access to adequate food, housing, and clothing. Austerity was very restrictive until 1953; the previous year, Israel had signed a reparations agreement with West Germany, in which the West German government would pay Israel as compensation for the Holocaust, due to Israel&#x27;s taking in a large number of Holocaust survivors. The resulting influx of foreign capital boosted the Israeli economy and allowed for the relaxing of most restrictions. The remaining austerity measures were gradually phased out throughout the following years.

When new immigrants arrived in Israel, they were sprayed with DDT, underwent a medical examination, were inoculated against diseases, and were given food. The earliest immigrants received desirable homes in established urban areas, but most of the immigrants were then sent to transit camps, known initially as immigrant camps, and later as &quot;Ma&#x27;abarot&quot;. Many were also initially housed in reception centers in military barracks. By the end of 1950, some 93,000 immigrants were housed in 62 transit camps. The Israeli government&#x27;s goal was to get the immigrants out of refugee housing and into society as speedily as possible. Immigrants who left the camps received a ration card, an identity card, a mattress, a pair of blankets, and $21 to $36 in cash. They settled either in established cities and towns, or in kibbutzim and moshavim. Many others stayed in the &quot;Ma&#x27;abarot&quot; as they were gradually turned into permanent cities and towns, which became known as development towns, or were absorbed as neighborhoods of the towns they were attached to, and the tin dwellings were replaced with permanent housing.

In the early 1950s, the immigration wave subsided, and emigration increased; ultimately, some 10% of the immigrants would leave Israel for other countries in the following years. In 1953, immigration to Israel averaged 1,200 a month, while emigration averaged 700 a month. The end of the period of mass immigration gave Israel a critical opportunity to more rapidly absorb the immigrants still living in transit camps. The Israeli government built 260 new settlements and 78,000 housing units to accommodate the immigrants, and by the mid-1950s, almost all were in permanent housing. The last &quot;ma&#x27;abarot&quot; closed in 1963.

In the mid-1950s, a smaller wave of immigration began from North African countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Egypt, many of which were in the midst of nationalist struggles. Between 1952 and 1964, some 240,000 North African Jews came to Israel. During this period, smaller but significant numbers arrived from other places such as Europe, Iran, India, and Latin America. In particular, a small immigration wave from then communist Poland, known as the &quot;Gomulka Aliyah&quot;, took place during this period. From 1956 to 1960, Poland permitted free Jewish emigration, and some 50,000 Polish Jews immigrated to Israel.

Since the founding of the State of Israel, the Jewish Agency for Israel was mandated as the organization responsible for aliyah in the diaspora.

===From Arab countries===


From 1948 until the early 1970s, around 900,000 Jews from Arab lands left, fled, or were expelled from various Arab nations, of which an estimated 650,000 settled in Israel. In the course of Operation Magic Carpet (1949–1950), nearly the entire community of Yemenite Jews (about 49,000) immigrated to Israel. Its other name, Operation On Wings of Eagles (Hebrew: כנפי נשרים, Kanfei Nesharim), was inspired by

Exodus 19:4: &quot;Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles&#x27; wings, and brought you unto myself.&quot;

and

Isaiah 40:31: &quot;But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint&quot;.

Some 120,000 Iraqi Jews were airlifted to Israel in Operation Ezra and Nehemiah.

===From Iran===
Following the establishment of Israel, about one-third of Iranian Jews, most of them poor, immigrated to Israel, and immigration from Iran continued throughout the following decades. An estimated 70,000 Iranian Jews immigrated to Israel between 1948 and 1978. Following the Islamic Revolution in 1979, most of the Iranian Jewish community left, with some 20,000 Iranian Jews immigrating to Israel. Many Iranian Jews also settled in the United States (especially in New York City and Los Angeles).

===From Ethiopia===

The first major wave of aliyah from Ethiopia took place in the mid-1970s. The massive airlift known as Operation Moses began to bring Ethiopian Jews to Israel on November 18, 1984, and ended on January 5, 1985. During those six weeks, some 6,500–8,000 Ethiopian Jews were flown from Sudan to Israel. An estimated 2,000–4,000 Jews died en route to Sudan or in Sudanese refugee camps. In 1991 Operation Solomon was launched to bring the Beta Israel Jews of Ethiopia. In one day, May 24, 34 aircraft landed at Addis Ababa and brought 14,325 Jews from Ethiopia to Israel. Since that time, Ethiopian Jews have continued to immigrate to Israel bringing the number of Ethiopian-Israelis today to over 100,000.

=== From Romania ===

After the war, Romania had second-largest Jewish population in Europe, of around 350,000 or higher. In 1949, 118,939 Romanian Jews had emigrated to Israel since the war ended.

Romanian Jews were, under their own will, &quot;sold&quot; or &quot;exchanged&quot; to Israel in the 1950s with the help of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee for about 8,000 lei (about 420 dollars). The price of these Jews usually varied according to their &quot;worth&quot;. This practice continued at a slower pace from 1965 under Nicolae Ceaușescu, a Romanian communist leader. During the 1950s, West Germany had been also paying Romania an amount of money in exchange for some Germans of Romania, and, just like the Jews (both of which were regarded as &quot;co-nationals&quot;), their price was &quot;calculated&quot;. Ceaușescu, happy with these policies, even declared that &quot;oil, Germans, and Jews are our most important export commodities&quot;.

Israeli government paid to facilitate aliyah, and around 235,000 people emigrated from Romania to Israel under this agreement. When Romania was under control of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, he received 10 million dollars per year, and only he had the access to the money transferred to the secret account. Israel also bought Romanian goods and invested into Romania&#x27;s economy. After his death, Ceauşescu practically sold the Jews to Israel, and received between 4,000 and 6,000$ per person. Israel could have transferred nearly 60 million dollars for the aliyah. Another estimation is higher - according to Radu Ioanid, &quot;Ceausescu sold 40,577 Jews to Israel for $112,498,800, at a price of $2,500 and later at $3,300 per head.&quot;

===From the Soviet Union and post-Soviet states===


A mass emigration was politically undesirable for the Soviet regime. The only acceptable ground was family reunification, and a formal petition (&quot;вызов&quot;, &quot;vyzov&quot;) from a relative from abroad was required for the processing to begin. Often, the result was a formal refusal. The risks to apply for an exit visa compounded because the entire family had to quit their jobs, which in turn would make them vulnerable to charges of social parasitism, a criminal offense. Because of these hardships, Israel set up the group Lishkat Hakesher in the early 1950s to maintain contact and promote aliyah with Jews behind the Iron Curtain.

From Israel&#x27;s establishment in 1948 to the Six-Day War in 1967, Soviet aliyah remained minimal. Those who made aliyah during this period were mainly elderly people granted clearance to leave for family reunification purposes. Only about 22,000 Soviet Jews managed to reach Israel. In the wake of the Six-Day War, the USSR broke off the diplomatic relations with the Jewish state. An Anti-Zionist propaganda campaign in the state-controlled mass media and the rise of Zionology were accompanied by harsher discrimination of the Soviet Jews. By the end of the 1960s, Jewish cultural and religious life in the Soviet Union had become practically impossible, and the majority of Soviet Jews were assimilated and non-religious, but this new wave of state-sponsored anti-Semitism on one hand, and the sense of pride for victorious Jewish nation over Soviet-armed Arab armies on the other, stirred up Zionist feelings.

After the Dymshits-Kuznetsov hijacking affair and the crackdown that followed, strong international condemnations caused the Soviet authorities to increase the emigration quota. In the years 1960–1970, the USSR let only 4,000 people leave; in the following decade, the number rose to 250,000. The exodus of Soviet Jews began in 1968.

Between 1968 and 1973, almost all Soviet Jews allowed to leave settled in Israel, and only a small minority moved to other Western countries. However, in the following years, the number of those moving to other Western nations increased. Soviet Jews granted permission to leave were taken by train to Austria to be processed and then flown to Israel. There, the ones who chose not to go to Israel, called &quot;dropouts&quot;, exchanged their immigrant invitations to Israel for refugee status in a Western country, especially the United States. Eventually, most Soviet Jews granted permission to leave became dropouts. Overall, between 1970 and 1988, some 291,000 Soviet Jews were granted exit visas, of whom 165,000 moved to Israel and 126,000 moved to the United States. In 1989 a record 71,000 Soviet Jews were granted exodus from the USSR, of whom only 12,117 immigrated to Israel.

In 1989 the United States changed its immigration policy of unconditionally granting Soviet Jews refugee status. That same year, Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev ended restrictions on Jewish immigration, and the Soviet Union itself collapsed in 1991. Since then, about a million people from the former Soviet Union immigrated to Israel, including approximately 240,000 who were not Jewish according to rabbinical law, but were eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return.

The number of immigrants counted as halachically non-Jewish from the former USSR has been constantly rising ever since 1989. For example, in 1990 around 96% of the immigrants were halachically Jewish and only 4% were non-Jewish family members. However, in 2000, the proportion was: Jews (includes children from non-Jewish father and Jewish mother) - 47%, Non-Jewish spouses of Jews - 14%, children from Jewish father and non-Jewish mother - 17%, Non-Jewish spouses of children from Jewish father and non-Jewish mother - 6%, non-Jews with a Jewish grandparent - 14% &amp; Non-Jewish spouses of non-Jews with a Jewish grandparent - 2%.

Following the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukrainian Jews making aliyah from Ukraine reached 142% higher during the first four months of 2014 compared to the previous year. In 2014, aliyah from the former Soviet Union went up 50% from the previous year with some 11,430 people or approximately 43% of all Jewish immigrants arrived from the former Soviet Union, propelled from the increase from Ukraine with some 5,840 new immigrants have come from Ukraine over the course of the year.

The wave of aliyah from Russia since 2014 has been called &quot;Putin&#x27;s aliyah&quot;, &quot;Putin&#x27;s exodus&quot;, and &quot;cheese aliyah&quot; (foreign cheese was one of the first products to disappear from Russian shops because of anti-sanctions imposed by the Russian government). The number of repatriants in this wave is comparable with that coming from the USSR between 1970 and 1988.

Following 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Israel announced &quot;Immigrants Come Home&quot; operation. As of June 2022, more than 25,000 people arrived in Israel from Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Moldova.

===From Latin America===

In the 1999–2002 Argentine political and economic crisis that caused a run on the banks, wiped out billions of dollars in deposits and decimated Argentina&#x27;s middle class, most of the country&#x27;s estimated 200,000 Jews were directly affected. Some 4,400 chose to start over and move to Israel, where they saw opportunity.

More than 10,000 Argentine Jews have immigrated to Israel since 2000, joining the thousands of previous Argentine immigrants already there. The crisis in Argentina also affected its neighbour country Uruguay, from which about half of its 40,000-strong Jewish community left, mainly to Israel, in the same period. During 2002 and 2003 the Jewish Agency for Israel launched an intensive public campaign to promote aliyah from the region, and offered additional economic aid for immigrants from Argentina. Although the economy of Argentina improved, and some who had immigrated to Israel from Argentina moved back following South American country&#x27;s economic growth from 2003 onwards, Argentine Jews continue to immigrate to Israel, albeit in smaller numbers than before. The Argentine community in Israel is about 50,000-70,000 people, the largest Latin American group in the country.

There has also been immigration from other Latin American countries that have experienced crises, though they have come in smaller numbers and are not eligible for the same economic benefits as immigrants to Israel from Argentina.

In Venezuela, growing antisemitism in the country, including antisemitic violence, caused an increasing number of Jews to move to Israel during the 2000s. For the first time in Venezuelan history, Jews began leaving for Israel in the hundreds. By November 2010, more than half of Venezuela&#x27;s 20,000-strong Jewish community had left the country.

===From France===

From 2000 to 2009, more than 13,000 French Jews immigrated to Israel, largely as a result of growing anti-semitism in the country. A peak was reached in 2005, with 2,951 immigrants. However, between 20 and 30% eventually returned to France.

In 2012, some 200,000 French citizens lived in Israel. During the same year, following the election of François Hollande and the Jewish school shooting in Toulouse, as well as ongoing acts of anti-semitism and the European economic crisis, an increasing number of French Jews began buying property in Israel. In August 2012, it was reported that anti-semitic attacks had risen by 40% in the five months following the Toulouse shooting, and that many French Jews were seriously considering immigrating to Israel. In 2013, 3,120 French Jews immigrated to Israel, marking a 63% increase over the previous year. In the first two months of 2014, French Jewish aliyah increased precipitously by 312% with 854 French Jews making aliyah over the first two months. Immigration from France throughout 2014 has been attributed to several factors, of which includes increasing antisemitism, in which many Jews have been harassed and attacked by a fusillade of local thugs and gangs, a stagnant European economy and concomitant high youth unemployment rates.

During the first few months of 2014, The Jewish Agency of Israel continued to encourage an increase of French aliyah through aliyah fairs, Hebrew language courses, sessions which help potential immigrants to find jobs in Israel, and immigrant absorption in Israel. A May 2014 survey revealed that 74 percent of French Jews considered leaving France for Israel; of those considering leaving, 29.9 percent cited anti-Semitism. Another 24.4 cited their desire to “preserve their Judaism,” while 12.4 percent said they were attracted by other countries. “Economic considerations” was cited by 7.5 percent of the respondents. By June 2014, it was estimated by the end of 2014 a full 1 percent of the French Jewish community will have made aliyah to Israel, the largest in a single year. Many Jewish leaders stated the emigration is being driven by a combination of factors, including the cultural gravitation towards Israel and France&#x27;s economic woes, especially for the younger generation drawn by the possibility of other socioeconomic opportunities in the more vibrant Israeli economy. During the Hebrew year 5774 (September 2013 - September 2014) for the first time ever, more Jews made aliyah from France than any other country, numbering approximately 6,000 and fleeing antisemitism, pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist violence, as well as and economic malaise.

In January 2015, events such as the Charlie Hebdo shooting and Porte de Vincennes hostage crisis created a shock wave of fear across the French Jewish community. As a result of these events, the Jewish Agency planned an aliyah plan for 120,000 French Jews who wished to make aliyah. In addition, with Europe&#x27;s stagnant economy, many affluent French Jewish skilled professionals, businesspeople and investors sought Israel as a start-up haven for international investments, as well as for job and new business opportunities. In addition, Dov Maimon, a French Jewish émigré who studies migration as a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute, expects as many as 250,000 French Jews to make aliyah by 2030.

Hours after an attack and an ISIS flag was raised on a gas factory near Lyon where the severed head of a local businessman was pinned to the gates on June 26, 2015, Immigration and Absorption Minister Ze’ev Elkin strongly urged the French Jewish community to move to Israel and made it a national priority for Israel to welcome French Jews with open arms. Immigration from France increased: in the first half of 2015, approximately 5,100 French Jews made aliyah to Israel, or 25% more than in the same period during the previous year.

Following the November 2015 Paris attacks committed by suspected ISIS affiliates in retaliation for Opération Chammal, one source reported that 80 percent of French Jews were considering making aliyah. According to the Jewish Agency, nearly 6,500 French Jews made aliyah between January and November 2015.

===From North America===
More than 200,000 North American immigrants live in Israel. There has been a steady flow of immigration from North America since Israel&#x27;s inception in 1948.

Several thousand American Jews moved to Mandate Palestine before the State of Israel was established. From Israel&#x27;s establishment in 1948 to the Six-Day War in 1967, aliyah from the United States and Canada was minimal. In 1959, a former President of the Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel estimated that out of the 35,000 American and Canadian Jews who had made aliyah, only 6,000 remained.

Following the Six-Day War in 1967, and the subsequent euphoria among world Jewry, significant numbers arrived in the late 1960s and 1970s, whereas it had been a mere trickle before. Between 1967 and 1973, 60,000 North American Jews immigrated to Israel. However, many of them later returned to their original countries. An estimated 58% of American Jews who immigrated to Israel between 1961 and 1972 ended up returning to the United States.

Like Western European immigrants, North Americans tend to immigrate to Israel more for religious, ideological, and political purposes, and not financial or security ones. Many immigrants began arriving in Israel after the First and Second Intifada, with a total of 3,052 arriving in 2005 — the highest number since 1983.

Nefesh B&#x27;Nefesh, founded in 2002 by Rabbi Yehoshua Fass and Tony Gelbart, works to encourage aliyah from North America and the UK by providing financial assistance, employment services and streamlined governmental procedures. Nefesh B’Nefesh works in cooperation with the Jewish Agency and the Israeli Government in increasing the numbers of North American and British immigrants.

Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, American Jewish immigration to Israel rose. This wave of immigration was triggered by Israel&#x27;s lower unemployment rate, combined with financial incentives offered to new Jewish immigrants. In 2009, aliyah was at its highest in 36 years, with 3,324 North American Jews making aliyah.

===Since the 1990s===

Since the mid-1990s, there has been a steady stream of South African, American and French Jews who have either made aliyah, or purchased property in Israel for potential future immigration. Over 2,000 French Jews moved to Israel each year between 2000 and 2004 due to anti-Semitism in France. The Bnei Menashe Jews from India, whose recent discovery and recognition by mainstream Judaism as descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes is subject to some controversy, slowly started their aliyah in the early 1990s and continue arriving in slow numbers. Organizations such as Nefesh B&#x27;Nefesh and Shavei Israel help with aliyah by supporting financial aid and guidance on a variety of topics such as finding work, learning Hebrew, and assimilation into Israeli culture.

In early 2007 &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported that aliyah for the year of 2006 was down approximately 9% from 2005, &quot;the lowest number of immigrants recorded since 1988&quot;. The number of new immigrants in 2007 was 18,127, the lowest since 1988. Only 36% of these new immigrants came from the former Soviet Union (close to 90% in the 1990s) while the number of immigrants from countries like France and the United States was stable. Some 15,452 immigrants arrived in Israel in 2008 and 16,465 in 2009. On October 20, 2009, the first group of Kaifeng Jews arrived in Israel, in an aliyah operation coordinated by Shavei Israel. &quot;Shalom Life&quot; reported that over 19,000 new immigrants arrived in Israel in 2010, an increase of 16 percent over 2009.

====Paternity testing====
In 2013, the office of the Prime Minister of Israel announced that some people born out of wedlock, &quot;wishing to immigrate to Israel could be subjected to DNA testing&quot; to prove their paternity is as they claim. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the genetic paternity testing idea is based on the recommendations of Nativ, an Israeli government organization that has helped Soviet and post-Soviet Jews with aliyah since the 1950s.

==Holiday==

Yom HaAliyah (Aliyah Day) () is an Israeli national holiday celebrated annually according to the Jewish calendar on the tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan to commemorate the Jewish people entering the Land of Israel as written in the Hebrew Bible, which happened on the tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan (). The holiday was also established to acknowledge Aliyah, immigration to the Jewish state, as a core value of the State of Israel, and honor the ongoing contributions of Olim, Jewish immigrants, to Israeli society. Yom HaAliyah is also observed in Israeli schools on the seventh of the Hebrew month of Cheshvan.

The opening clause of the Yom HaAliyah Law states:

The original day chosen for Yom HaAliyah, the tenth of Nisan, is laden with symbolism. Although a modern holiday created by the Knesset of Israel, the tenth of Nisan is a date of religious significance for the Jewish People as recounted in the Hebrew Bible and in traditional Jewish thought.

On the tenth of Nisan, according to the biblical narrative in the Book of Joshua, Joshua and the Israelites crossed the Jordan River at Gilgal into the Promised Land while carrying the Ark of the Covenant. It was thus the first documented &quot;mass aliyah.&quot; On that day, God commanded the Israelites to commemorate and celebrate the occasion by erecting twelve stones with the text of the Torah engraved upon them. The stones represented the entirety of the Jewish nation&#x27;s twelve tribes and their gratitude for God&#x27;s gift of the Land of Israel () to them.

Yom HaAliyah, as a modern holiday celebration, began in 2009 as a grassroots community initiative and young Olim self-initiated movement in Tel Aviv, spearheaded by the TLV Internationals organization of the Am Yisrael Foundation. On June 21, 2016, the Twentieth Knesset voted in favor of codifying the grassroots initiative into law by officially adding Yom HaAliyah to the Israeli national calendar. The Yom HaAliyah bill was co-sponsored by Knesset members from different parties in a rare instance of cooperation across the political spectrum of the opposition and coalition.

<doc id="351517" wikidata="Q2377218" url="?curid=351517" title="Systolic array">
<text>In parallel computer architectures, a systolic array is a homogeneous network of tightly coupled data processing units (DPUs) called cells or nodes. Each node or DPU independently computes a partial result as a function of the data received from its upstream neighbours, stores the result within itself and passes it downstream. Systolic arrays were first used in Colossus, which was an early computer used to break German Lorenz ciphers during World War II. Due to the classified nature of Colossus, they were independently invented or rediscovered by H. T. Kung and Charles Leiserson who described arrays for many dense linear algebra computations (matrix product, solving systems of linear equations, LU decomposition, etc.) for banded matrices. Early applications include computing greatest common divisors of integers and polynomials. They are sometimes classified as multiple-instruction single-data (MISD) architectures under Flynn&#x27;s taxonomy, but this classification is questionable because a strong argument can be made to distinguish systolic arrays from any of Flynn&#x27;s four categories: SISD, SIMD, MISD, MIMD, as discussed later in this article.

The parallel input data flows through a network of hard-wired processor nodes, which combine, process, merge or sort the input data into a derived result. Because the wave-like propagation of data through a systolic array resembles the pulse of the human circulatory system, the name &quot;systolic&quot; was coined from medical terminology. The name is derived from systole as an analogy to the regular pumping of blood by the heart.

==Applications==
Systolic arrays are often hard-wired for specific operations, such as &quot;multiply and accumulate&quot;, to perform massively parallel integration, convolution, correlation, matrix multiplication or data sorting tasks. They are also used for dynamic programming algorithms, used in DNA and protein sequence analysis.

==Architecture==
A systolic array typically consists of a large monolithic network of primitive computing nodes which can be hardwired or software configured for a specific application. The nodes are usually fixed and identical, while the interconnect is programmable. The more general wavefront processors, by contrast, employ sophisticated and individually programmable nodes which may or may not be monolithic, depending on the array size and design parameters. The other distinction is that systolic arrays rely on synchronous data transfers, while wavefront tend to work ly.

Unlike the more common Von Neumann architecture, where program execution follows a script of instructions stored in common memory, addressed and sequenced under the control of the CPU&#x27;s program counter (PC), the individual nodes within a systolic array are triggered by the arrival of new data and always process the data in exactly the same way. The actual processing within each node may be hard wired or block micro coded, in which case the common node personality can be block programmable.

The systolic array paradigm with data-streams driven by data counters, is the counterpart of the Von Neumann architecture with instruction-stream driven by a program counter. Because a systolic array usually sends and receives multiple data streams, and multiple data counters are needed to generate these data streams, it supports data parallelism.

==Goals and benefits==
A major benefit of systolic arrays is that all operand data and partial results are stored within (passing through) the processor array. There is no need to access external buses, main memory or internal caches during each operation as is the case with Von Neumann or Harvard sequential machines. The sequential limits on parallel performance dictated by Amdahl&#x27;s Law also do not apply in the same way, because data dependencies are implicitly handled by the programmable node interconnect and there are no sequential steps in managing the highly parallel data flow.

Systolic arrays are therefore extremely good at artificial intelligence, image processing, pattern recognition, computer vision and other tasks that animal brains do particularly well. Wavefront processors in general can also be very good at machine learning by implementing self configuring neural nets in hardware.

==Classification controversy==
While systolic arrays are officially classified as MISD, their classification is somewhat problematic. Because the input is typically a vector
of independent values, the systolic array is definitely not SISD. Since these input values are merged and combined into the result(s) and do not maintain their independence as they would in a SIMD vector processing unit, the array cannot be classified as such. Consequently, the array cannot be classified as a MIMD either, because MIMD can be viewed as a mere collection of smaller SISD and SIMD machines.

Finally, because the data swarm is transformed as it passes through the array from node to node, the multiple nodes are not operating on the same data, which makes the MISD classification a misnomer. The other reason why a systolic array should not qualify as a MISD is the same as the one which disqualifies it from the SISD category: The input data is typically a vector not a single data value, although one could argue that any given input vector is a single item of data.

In spite of all of the above, systolic arrays are often offered as a classic example of MISD architecture in textbooks on parallel computing and in engineering classes. If the array is viewed from the outside as atomic it should perhaps be classified as SFMuDMeR = single function, multiple data, merged result(s).

Systolic arrays use a pre-defined computational flow graph that connects their nodes. Kahn process networks use a similar flow graph, but are distinguished by the nodes working in lock-step in the systolic array: in a Kahn network, there are FIFO queues
between each node.

==Detailed description==
A systolic array is composed of matrix-like rows of data processing units called cells. Data processing units (DPUs) are similar to central processing units (CPUs), (except for the usual lack of a program counter, since operation is transport-triggered, i.e., by the arrival of a data object). Each cell shares the information with its neighbors immediately after processing. The systolic array is often rectangular where data flows across the array between neighbour DPUs, often with different data flowing in different directions. The data streams entering and leaving the ports of the array are generated by auto-sequencing memory units, ASMs. Each ASM includes a data counter. In embedded systems a data stream may also be input from and/or output to an external source.

An example of a systolic algorithm might be designed for matrix multiplication. One matrix is fed in a row at a time from the top of the array and is passed down the array, the other matrix is fed in a column at a time from the left hand side of the array and passes from left to right. Dummy values are then passed in until each processor has seen one whole row and one whole column. At this point, the result of the multiplication is stored in the array and can now be output a row or a column at a time, flowing down or across the array.

Systolic arrays are arrays of DPUs which are connected to a small number of nearest neighbour DPUs in a mesh-like topology. DPUs perform a sequence of operations on data that flows between them. Because the traditional systolic array synthesis methods have been practiced by algebraic algorithms, only uniform arrays with only linear pipes can be obtained, so that the architectures are the same in all DPUs. The consequence is, that only applications with regular data dependencies can be implemented on classical systolic arrays. Like SIMD machines, clocked systolic arrays compute in &quot;lock-step&quot; with each processor undertaking alternate compute | communicate phases. But systolic arrays with asynchronous handshake between DPUs are called &quot;wavefront arrays&quot;.
One well-known systolic array is Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s iWarp processor, which has been manufactured by Intel. An iWarp system has a linear array processor connected by data buses going in both directions.

==History==
Systolic arrays (also known as &quot;wavefront processors&quot;), were first described by H. T. Kung and Charles E. Leiserson, who published the first paper describing systolic arrays in 1979. However, the first machine known to have used a similar technique was the Colossus Mark II in 1944.

==Examples==
=== Polynomial evaluation ===
Horner&#x27;s rule for evaluating a polynomial is:

:formula_1

A linear systolic array in which the processors are arranged in pairs: one multiplies its input by formula_2 and passes the result to the right, the next adds formula_3 and passes the result to the right.

=== Convolution ===

Consider a chain of processing elements (PEs), each performing a multiply-accumulate operation. It processes input data (formula_4) and weights (formula_5) systolically, meaning data flows through the array in a regular, rhythmic manner. The weights remain stationary within each PE, while the input data and partial sums (formula_6) move in opposite directions.

Each PE performs the following operation:formula_7where:

* formula_8 is the input data.
* formula_9 is the incoming partial sum.
* formula_10 is the weight stored in the PE.
* formula_11 is the output data (passed to the next PE).
* formula_12 is the updated partial sum.

From the left, the input stream is formula_13, and from the right, the output stream is formula_14. If formula_15 enter the rightmost PE simultaneously, then the leftmost PE outputsformula_16This is the 1-dimensional convolution. Similarly, n-dimensional convolution can be computed by an n-dimensional array of PEs.

Many other implementations of the 1D convolutions are available, with different data flows.

See Figure 12 for an algorithm that performs on-the-fly least-squares using one- and two-dimensional systolic arrays.

==Implementations==
* Cisco PXF network processor is internally organized as systolic array.
* Google’s TPU is also designed around a systolic array.
* Paracel FDF4T TestFinder text search system
* Paracel FDF4G GeneMatcher Biological (DNA and Protein) search system
* Inferentia chip at Amazon Web Services
*MIT Eyeriss is a systolic array accelerator for convolutional neural networks.

<text>Merton Howard Miller (May 16, 1923 – June 3, 2000) was an American economist, and the co-author of the Modigliani–Miller theorem (1958), which proposed the irrelevance of debt-equity structure. He shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990, along with Harry Markowitz and William F. Sharpe. Miller spent most of his academic career at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Booth School of Business.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Miller was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Jewish parents Sylvia and Joel Miller, a housewife and attorney. He attended Harvard University as an undergraduate student. He worked during World War II as an economist in the division of tax research of the Treasury Department, and received a Ph.D. in economics from Johns Hopkins University, 1952. His first academic appointment after receiving his doctorate was Visiting Assistant Lecturer at the London School of Economics.

===Career===
In 1958, at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), he collaborated with his colleague Franco Modigliani on the paper &quot;The Cost of Capital, Corporate Finance and the Theory of Investment&quot;. This paper urged a fundamental objection to the traditional view of corporate finance, according to which a corporation can reduce its cost of capital by finding the right debt-to-equity ratio. According to the Modigliani–Miller theorem, on the other hand, there is no right ratio, so corporate managers should seek to minimize tax liability and maximize corporate net wealth, letting the debt ratio chips fall where they will.

The way in which they arrived at this conclusion made use of the &quot;no arbitrage&quot; argument, i.e. the premise that any state of affairs that will allow traders of any market instrument to create a riskless money machine will almost immediately disappear. They set the pattern for many arguments based on that premise in subsequent years.

Miller wrote or co-authored eight books. He became a fellow of the Econometric Society in 1975 and was president of the American Finance Association in 1976. He was on the faculty of the University of Chicago&#x27;s Booth School of Business from 1961 until his retirement in 1993, although he continued teaching at the school for several more years.

His works formed the basis of the &quot;Modigliani-Miller Financial Theory&quot;.

He served as a public director on the Chicago Board of Trade 1983–85 and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange from 1990 until his death in Chicago on June 3, 2000. In 1993, Miller waded into the controversy surrounding $2 billion in trading losses by what was characterized as a rogue futures trader at a subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft, arguing in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that management of the subsidiary was to blame for panicking and liquidating the position too early. In 1995, Miller was engaged by Nasdaq to rebut allegations of price fixing.

===Personal life===
Miller was married to Eleanor Miller, who died in 1969. He was survived by his second wife, Katherine Miller, and by three children from his first marriage: Pamela (1952), Margot (1955), and Louise (1958), and two grandsons.

<doc id="351524" wikidata="Q737332" url="?curid=351524" title="Ben-Gurion University of the Negev">
<text>Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) (, &quot;Universitat Ben-Guriyon baNegev&quot;) is a public research university in Beersheba, Israel. Named after Israeli national founder David Ben-Gurion, the university was founded in 1969 and currently has five campuses: three in Beersheba, one in Sede Boqer and one in Eilat.

Ben-Gurion University has about 20,000 students. Some of its research institutes include the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, the Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research with the Albert Katz International School for Desert Studies, and the Ben-Gurion Research Institute for the Study of Israel and Zionism.

== History ==
Ben-Gurion University was established in 1969 as the University of the Negev with the aim of promoting the development of the Negev desert that comprises more than sixty percent of Israel. The University was later renamed after Israel&#x27;s founder and first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, who believed that the future of the country lay in this region. After Ben-Gurion&#x27;s death in 1973, the University was renamed Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. The Presidents of the university have been Moshe Prywes (1973–75), Yosef Tekoah (1975–81), Shlomo Gazit (1982–85), Chaim Elata (1985–90), Avishay Braverman (1990–2006), Rivka Carmi (2006–18), and Daniel Chamovitz (2019–present). The current Chairman of the Executive Council is Avi Nissenkorn.

In 2016, the late Dr. Howard and Lottie Marcus bequeathed a legacy gift of approximately $400 million to Ben-Gurion University. This is the largest bequest ever made to an Israeli university and the most generous donation to any institution in the State of Israel. The funds doubled the University&#x27;s existing endowment.

==Academics==
===University rankings===

BGU has been ranked 320th in the world, 70th in Asia and 4th in Israel according to the 2016 QS World University Rankings. 
BGU also ranked 31st overall in the ranking of young universities according to the 2016 QS &quot;Top 50 Under 50&quot; and the only one in Israel to date.
BGU is ranked between 101st and 150th overall in computer science according to the 2015 Academic Ranking of World Universities in Computer Science for four consecutive years.
===Faculties, schools, research institutes and centers===


Ben-Gurion University has five faculties with 51 academic departments and units: Faculty of Engineering Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Guilford Glazer Faculty of Business and Management.

Ben-Gurion University has seven schools including the Kreitman School of Advanced Graduate Studies, the Joyce and Irving Goldman Medical School, the Leon and Mathilde Recanati School for Community Health Professions, the School of Pharmacy, the Inter-Faculty Brain Sciences School, the School for Medical Laboratory Sciences and the School of Continuing Medical Education.

Ben-Gurion University has eight research institutes including the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, the Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, the Ben-Gurion Research Institute for the Study of Israel and Zionism, and Heksherim – The Research Institute for Jewish and Israeli Literature and Culture.

In 1978 Prof. Alfred Inselberg, then with the Faculty of Mathematics, together with Dr. Sam Bergman and Dr. Avraham Melkman initiated the Computer Science program which by 1982 had attracted more than 200 students. Notably, this was the first university program in Israel where students were taught Pascal, used terminals rather than punch-card machines and where the first Computer Graphics Laboratory in Israel was established. This was the genesis of Computer Science education at Ben-Gurion University which eventually led to a separate Department of Computer Science.

====The Medical School for International Health (MSIH)====
The Medical School for International Health grew out of collaborations between faculty at Ben-Gurion University and Columbia University. A joint global health and medical care program, it was established in 1997.

The MSIH is a four-year, North American-style medical school that incorporates global health coursework into all four years of the medical school curriculum. It is an English-language collaboration between Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Faculty of Health Sciences and Columbia University Irving Medical Center and is located in Beersheba, Israel. The school enrolls more than 30 students each year. Most of the students are from the United States, with several from Canada and other countries.

In October 2018, The Medical School for International Health celebrated 20 years of existence, by holding a two-day seminar to recognize its achievements and bring together its many partners from around the world. The event concluded with the Physicians&#x27; Oath Ceremony (not to be confused with a White Coat Ceremony) by the Class of 2022. 
In October 2019, the 21st cohort of MSIH (Class of 2023) took their Physician&#x27;s Oath at a special ceremony on campus. For the first time in the program&#x27;s history, the faculty presented each student of the class with an actual White Coat emblazoned with the MSIH logo.

===Interdisciplinary research centers===
There are sixty one interdisciplinary research centers at Ben-Gurion University including: the S. Daniel Abraham International Center for Health and Nutrition, the Robert H. Arnow Center for Bedouin Studies and Development, the Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center, the Goldstein-Goren International Center for Jewish Thought, the Esther and Sidney Rabb Center for Holocaust and Redemption Studies, the Edmond J. Safra Center for the Design and Engineering of Functional Biopolymers, the Reimund Stadler Minerva Center for Mesoscale Macromolecular Engineering and the Zlotowski Center for Neurosciences.

===International programs===
BGU International has worked to increase the number of academic programs available to international students, in English instruction. The programs include: the Albert Katz International School of Desert Studies, the Medical School for International Health, the Israel Studies Masters Program, the African Sustainable Communities MA Program, the MBA International Program, and BGU International&#x27;s Summer Programs, Semester Study Abroad, and Academic Internship programs. The University hosts students from nearly 70 countries.

<text>New World Development Company Limited (NWD), is a Hong Kong–based company focused on property, hotels, infrastructure and services and department stores. It was established on 29 May 1970 by Cheng Yu-tung. The company is publicly listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK: 17) since 23 November 1972 and was formerly a constituent stock of Hong Kong Hang Seng Index.

Over the last four decades, the group has also actively participated in various businesses in Mainland China and established itself as one of the largest foreign direct investors in the country. The group&#x27;s existing investments in Mainland China has exceeded US$16.5 billion, spreading across four municipalities and over 19 provinces.

== History ==
New World Development was founded on May 29, 1970, with Dr. Ho Sin Hang as chairman and Cheng Yu-tung as Director and General Manager. The group went public on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) (SEHK: 17) in 1972.

=== Group Reorganization ===
To bring together infrastructure projects in Hong Kong and Mainland China, New World Infrastructure Limited (NWI) was created and listed on SEHK (SEHK: 301) in October 1995. New World Services Limited (NWS) was then formed in April 1997 to integrate the group&#x27;s service-related businesses. By July 1999, New World China Land Limited (NWCL) was launched to consolidate the group’s property projects in Mainland China and was listed on SEHK (SEHK: 917).

In September 2001, NWS purchased all outstanding shares of Ngo Kee Construction Company Limited. A year later, Pacific Ports Company Limited (PPC) acquired NWI and took ownership of NWS from NWD.

Reorganization of New World Group was finalized in January 2003. Following a name change from Pacific Ports Company Limited, NWS Holdings Limited emerged as the group&#x27;s service flagship, overseeing operations in services, infrastructure, and ports across Hong Kong, Macau, and Mainland China. All group shares were consolidated under NWS Holdings Limited, which then commenced trading on SEHK.

=== Recent Developments ===
New World Department Store China Limited (SEHK: 0825) went public on SEHK in July 2007. The Guangzhou Dongxin Expressway—in which NWS Holdings owned a 40.8% ownership stake—officially inaugurated in December 2010.

In April 2015, NWD formed a 50-50 joint venture with HIP Company Limited, a subsidiary of The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, to acquire the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong, Renaissance Harbour View, and Hyatt Regency TST with a deal valued at HK$18.5 billion, resulted in NWD receiving approximately HK$10 billion. NWD then launched its new healthcare brand, Humansa, and acquired FTLife in November and December 2018, respectively.

In October 2020, the group revealed plans to conserve Hong Kong’s 68-year-old State Theatre, a Grade I historic site, partnering with local and international designers and artisans. In that month, the group began selling THE PAVILIA FARM I, attracting 22,700 registrations in the first round, the highest for any residential property in Hong Kong since 1997. The group also committed over HKD 10 billion to create a large-scale cultural and retail complex in Prince Bay, Shenzhen.

In November 2020, NWD named its mixed-use development project within the SKYCITY complex at the Hong Kong International Airport &quot;11 SKIES&quot;. NWD established Share for Good, Hong Kong&#x27;s first large-scale crowd-donation platform in March 2022, to meet the immediate needs of the impoverished in the fifth wave of COVID-19. In collaboration with Rafa Nadal Academy, Hong Kong Golf &amp; Tennis Academy welcomed Asia&#x27;s first Rafa Nadal Tennis Center in July 2022.

NWD collaborated with 4 corporations in July 2023 to establish the first &quot;Smart Community&quot; in a transitional housing complex. NWD signed Hong Kong&#x27;s first &quot;Project Cooperation Agreement regarding Northern Metropolis&quot; in December 2023, to develop a commercial and residential project in the Northern Metropolis with CR Land.

In 2024, NWD reported a HK$19.7 billion net loss for the year ended 30 June, the worst since the company was founded in 1970. Adrian Cheng Chi-Kong, the grandson of Cheng Yu-tung, was forced to step down as CEO in September. In December, NWD was kicked out of the Hang Seng Index (HSI). In the same month of being kicked out of HSI, Debtwire reported that NWD have sent out a letter to its bank lenders, seeking a waiver on loan conditions. NWD was seeking forbearance, after its net debt-to-assets ratio breached the 100 per cent threshold that may allow its lenders to recall their loans.

== Organization ==

New World Development owns listed companies NWS Holdings and New World Department Store China. New World China Land Limited is wholly owned by New World Development. The company also owned former listed company New World Hotels (Holdings). Rosewood Hotel Group, an hotel management company, is a former subsidiary of NWD group.

== Membership and Loyalty Program ==

=== New World CLUB ===
The New World CLUB is a loyalty program operated by the New World Group that offers members benefit such as exclusive discounts and events. There are currently 3 membership tiers.

=== K Dollar Program ===
The K Dollar Program is a loyalty initiative developed in collaboration between New World Development, K11, and Chow Tai Fook. By becoming a KLUB 11 member and linking to the K Dollar Program account, members can earn K Dollars, which can be used as instant cash at a wide range of participating merchants. A minimum spending amount of 10 K Dollars is required for redemption. The K Dollar conversion rate varies by KLUB 11 tier:

The program features over 1,000 merchants throughout Hong Kong, including locations within K11 Art Mall and Victoria Dockside.

In March 2024, a feature was introduced allowing members to link their Visa cards to the K11 HK app, enabling automatic earning of K Dollars without the need to queue up at the concierge, upload receipts, or scan the QR codes. This integration is part of a multi-year partnership between New World Development (NWD) and Visa to deepen customer engagement and stimulate local spend. Upon linking their Visa cards to the K11 HK app, customers who spend with Visa can earn K Dollars automatically.

==Controversies==
===Hung Hom Peninsula===

The Hung Hom Peninsula was sold for a below-market land premium of HK$864 million to New World Development, who subsequently sold off half share to Sun Hung Kai Properties. In 2004, the consortium announced the demolition of these buildings to make way for luxury apartments, to be faced with huge popular outcry about the needless destruction of &quot;perfectly good buildings&quot; to satisfy &quot;corporate greed&quot;. In an unprecedented about-turn, the developers withdrew the plan on 10 December 2004.

===Leung Chin-man===

In 2008, New World was the subject of controversy when it announced it had hired former Permanent Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands Leung Chin-man as deputy managing director and executive director of its China subsidiary, New World China Land Ltd. The Secretary for the Civil Service Denise Yue Chung-yee, signed off on the approval for him to take up the job within three years of leaving, failing to take into account the appearance of conflict of interest resulting from the Hung Hom Peninsula affair. New World argued that they hired Leung in good faith, after the government had given clearance. New World announced in the early hours of 16 August that the parties had agreed to rescind the contract.

===Avenue of Stars===

The company has managed the Avenue of Stars for 11 years, and its contract is due to expire. It was announced that the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong government would redevelop and expand the avenue jointly with the company. The Hong Kong government declared that the enhancement project would contain limited commercial appeal, and no luxury shops or high-end restaurants would be added. The walkway, very popular with tourists, was closed off for three years while the expansion was undertaken.

The decision to award the contract for the redevelopment to the company without putting it out to tender, on the justification that the project was non-profit, sparked controversy locally. Residents&#x27; groups and other development companies owning properties adjacent to the walk expressed discontent, whilst the LCSD claimed that consultations with the local district council had been favourable. In an apparent attempt to de-fuse the public furore at the apparent collusion between government and big business, the government promised a public consultation.

=== Chubby Hearts ===
HK$7.8 million was granted by the Hong Kong Mega Arts and Cultural Events Committee to host in February 2024 Chubby Hearts by British designer Anya Hindmarch, who has a shop in K11 Musea, a mall founded by New World Development.

<doc id="351533" wikidata="Q1330310" url="?curid=351533" title="Battle of Changban">
<text>The Battle of Changban was fought between the warlords Cao Cao and Liu Bei in October 208 in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. The battle took place at Changban (長坂; south of present-day Duodao District, Jingmen, Hubei).

== Background ==
After Cao Cao unified northern China under his control in 207, he made arrangements for a southern campaign on Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), which was governed by Liu Biao at the time. Initial minor invasions led by Xiahou Dun were repelled by Liu Biao&#x27;s vassal Liu Bei, whose forces were stationed at Xinye County at the northern border of Jing Province. Following that, Cao Cao personally led his armies south to attack Jing Province in August 208.

Around late August or September, when Cao Cao&#x27;s forces had reached Wancheng (宛城; in present-day Nanyang, Henan), Liu Biao died of illness and was succeeded by his younger son, Liu Cong. Liu Cong&#x27;s advisers Kuai Yue and Fu Xun convinced Liu Cong that he could not resist Cao Cao even with Liu Bei&#x27;s help, so Liu Cong agreed to surrender. Liu Bei, who was at Fancheng at the time, was not informed of Liu Cong&#x27;s decision to surrender. When Liu Bei became suspicious, he sent an attendant to Xiangyang to question Liu Cong, and only then would Liu Cong pass the news to Liu Bei through his subordinate Song Zhong (). Dismayed, Liu Bei drew his sword on Song Zhong, but did not kill him.

Liu Bei then called for a council of his advisors. Zhuge Liang suggested that Liu Bei should attack Liu Cong to secure Jing Province and defend against Cao Cao there, but Liu Bei rejected this and said, &quot;as Liu Biao was dying, he entrusted his orphans to me. I cannot turn from this obligation and seek my own advantage. How am I to face Liu Biao after I die?&quot;. Not willing to fall into the hands of Cao Cao, Liu Bei gathered his men and marched southward. As he passed Xiangyang he called out to Liu Cong, but Liu Cong dared not see him and hid. Many officials and civilians of Xiangyang followed Liu Bei as he left, as he was greatly respected by the people.

Between 28 September and 26 October 208, Liu Cong set out from Xiangyang towards Xinye to receive Cao Cao, surrendering Jing Province. Cao Cao took command of Jing Province&#x27;s military, especially its naval fleet, a component which Cao Cao&#x27;s forces lacked. Fearing that Liu Bei would take the strategic Jiangling County in the south, Cao Cao swiftly gave chase to Liu Bei with a 5,000-strong elite cavalry force, leaving his baggage behind. As Liu Bei was bringing along more than 100,000 unarmed people and thousands of carts of luggage, his force could not move very quickly. Someone suggested to Liu Bei that he should abandon the people for his safety, but Liu Bei did not have the heart to desert them when the people risked their own lives to follow him. Instead, Liu Bei had Guan Yu sail ahead down the Han River with a detachment of several hundred ships and take a roundabout route to Jiangling, where they planned to rendezvous.

== Battle ==
Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up with Liu Bei&#x27;s congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao&#x27;s forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei&#x27;s baggage. Xu Shu, a friend of Zhuge Liang who was also serving Liu Bei at the time, requested leave from Liu Bei and left to serve Cao Cao after learning that his mother had been captured by Cao Cao&#x27;s forces. Cao Cao&#x27;s subordinate Cao Chun also captured Liu Bei&#x27;s two daughters during the battle.

Zhang Fei commanded 20 horsemen as rearguard. He sent his troops into a nearby wooded area and had them move about frenetically as though their number was greater than it actually was. He then stood at the bridge; looking fierce and shaking his lance, he shouted: &quot;I am Zhang Yide. Come and battle me to the death!&quot; (Yide was Zhang Fei&#x27;s courtesy name). Believing there was an ambush in the woods behind Zhang Fei, none of Cao Cao&#x27;s men dared to go near him. Zhang Fei and his troops then crossed the bridges and destroyed them. While this bought some time for Liu Bei to escape, it also allowed Cao Cao&#x27;s men to realize that there was no ambush at all and resume their pursuit.

As Zhang Fei retreated with Liu Bei, Cao Cao ordered his men to build pontoon bridges and launch an assault, but a timely arrival of Guan Yu and his forces prevented Cao Cao from fully attaining victory.

In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, prompting suspicion that he had surrendered to Cao Cao. When someone reported that to Liu Bei, Liu Bei angrily threw a &quot;ji&quot; and said &quot;Zilong (Zhao Yun&#x27;s courtesy name) would never desert me.&quot; Surely enough, Zhao Yun came back with Liu Bei&#x27;s infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan. With this, Zhao Yun was promoted to General of the Standard ().

Turning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao&#x27;s elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu&#x27;s fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford (). Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou (in present-day Wuhan, Hubei.)

Cao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first.

== Aftermath ==
After the Battle of Changban, the land of Jing Province west of the Han River became territories of Cao Cao. Cao Cao entered Jiangling County and pacified the officials and peasants there. Cao Cao&#x27;s advisor Jia Xu suggested that Cao Cao should make full use of the resources in Jing Province to settle his troops before further territorial expansions, but Cao Cao preferred to use the momentum from his victories to attack the Jiangdong (or Wu) region next.

Lu Su, an adviser to the Jiangdong warlord Sun Quan, was originally on a mission to offer condolences for Liu Biao&#x27;s death. By the time he reached Jing Province, however, Liu Cong had already surrendered and Liu Bei had fled south. Lu Su went to see Liu Bei at Changban and, after Liu Bei&#x27;s defeat, followed him to Xiakou. There he asked where Liu Bei was heading after, and Liu Bei replied that he plans to take refuge under Wu Ju (), an old friend, in the distant Cangwu Commandery (east of present-day Guangxi). To this, Lu Su dissuaded Liu Bei from joining Wu Ju, saying Wu Ju was only an ordinary fellow who would not be independent for long; and persuaded Liu Bei to form an alliance with his lord Sun Quan against Cao Cao. Liu Bei was pleased at this suggestion, and sent Zhuge Liang to follow Lu Su back to meet Sun Quan and secure the alliance.

The successful formation of the Sun-Liu alliance led to the Battle of Red Cliffs shortly after in the same year, where the allied forces defeated Cao Cao&#x27;s overwhelming fleet, driving him back north and forming the basis of the Three Kingdoms.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the battle is romanticised into a showcase of the power and bravery of Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun.

Liu Bei&#x27;s wife Lady Mi and infant son A&#x27;dou (Liu Shan) are isolated from the rest during an attack by Cao Cao and his cavalry. Zhao Yun braves danger by fighting his way through enemy lines in search of Lady Mi and A&#x27;dou. He encounters the enemy general Xiahou En, defeats him and takes Cao Cao&#x27;s prized Qinggang Sword that could cut through armour from him. When Zhao Yun finally finds Lady Mi and A&#x27;dou beside a well, he urges them to mount his horse quickly, but Lady Mi refuses as she does not want to be a burden to Zhao Yun. She entrusts A&#x27;dou to Zhao Yun and commits suicide by throwing herself into the well. Zhao Yun then straps A&#x27;dou to his body and fights his way out against overwhelming numbers of enemy forces, bringing A&#x27;dou safely back to Liu Bei.

Cao Cao&#x27;s forces pursue Zhao Yun until they arrive at Changban Bridge, where Zhang Fei stands guard alone. Zhang Fei bellows a challenge at the enemy and shocks Xiahou Jie to death. Cao Cao&#x27;s soldiers also observe that the woods behind Zhang Fei are clouded in dust and believe that there is an ambush, so they retreat without a fight and Zhang Fei destroys the bridge and retreats as well. Zhang Fei had earlier ordered his men to tie tree branches to the tails of their horses and ride around in the woods, churning up dust to create an illusion of an ambush.

By then, Zhao Yun has returned with A&#x27;dou to his father safely. When he presented A&#x27;dou to Liu Bei, the warlord throws his infant son to the ground and exclaims that his son had nearly cost him one of his best warriors. Zhao Yun catches A&#x27;dou in time and reaffirms his allegiance to Liu Bei, pledging to serve his lord with his life and he does so, serving him until A&#x27;dou succeeds his father later.

===Historicity===
Zhao Yun&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; briefly stated that during the Battle of Changban, after Liu Bei abandoned his family and fled, Zhao Yun protected A&#x27;dou (carrying A&#x27;dou close to him) and Lady Gan and escorted them to safety. Both Lady Gan and Lady Mi also survived the battle. Zhang Fei&#x27;s biography also briefly mentioned that Zhang Fei remained behind with 20 horsemen to block Cao Cao&#x27;s pursuing forces. The bridge was already destroyed when Zhang Fei bellowed a challenge, similar in tone to the one in the novel, but without the highly exaggerated effect on the enemy. Cao Cao&#x27;s men did not dare to come near and Zhang Fei was safe. Xiahou En and Xiahou Jie are fictional characters.

==In popular culture==
The Battle of Changban is the highlight of Zhao Yun&#x27;s and Zhang Fei&#x27;s story mode in Koei&#x27;s video game series &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;.

The battle is also featured in the 2008–2009 two-part epic film &quot;Red Cliff&quot;.

<text>A business oligarch is generally a business magnate who controls sufficient resources to influence national politics. A business leader can be considered an oligarch if some of the following conditions are satisfied:
# uses monopolistic tactics to dominate an industry;
# possesses sufficient political power to promote their own interests, often exacerbating income inequality and corruption, particularly through policies that benefit the elite at the expense of the majority.
# controls multiple businesses, which intensively coordinate their activities.

More generally, an oligarch () is a &quot;member of an oligarchy; a person who is part of a small group holding power in a state&quot;.

<text>Wayne Richard Wells (November 4, 1965 – November 1, 2014), known professionally as Wayne Static, was an American musician, best known as the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, keyboardist, and primary lyricist for the industrial metal band Static-X, which he was the only constant member of the band until his death in 2014. He also released a solo album, &quot;Pighammer&quot;, in 2011. Static was recognizable for his unusual hairstyle; his hair was held up in a vertical position, a process that took about 20 minutes to complete (45 minutes, according to his mother). He was also known for his signature &quot;chintail&quot; beard.

==Early life==
Wells was born in Muskegon, Michigan, to Richard and Darlene Wells. He grew up in Shelby, Michigan before moving to Chicago, Illinois and California. He was three years old when he received his first toy guitar. His parents decided at age seven to get him his first real guitar, an S12 beginner model. Wells was given lessons, which paid off a year later when he won a talent contest playing &quot;Skip to My Lou&quot;. He later played in his first band at the age of 12 and decided he wanted to be a musician. In high school, Wells played in a band for the dances with classmates. He attended Shelby High School and had summer jobs which included working as an asparagus picker and in a cherry canning factory.

==Career==
After moving to Chicago, Wells created the post-punk band Deep Blue Dream in 1987 with drummer Ken Jay, bass player Eric Harris, and guitarist Billy Corgan; Corgan went on to form the Smashing Pumpkins. Deep Blue Dream was short lived as Wells and Jay relocated to California. In California, Wells and Jay formed Static-X along with Tony Campos on bass and Koichi Fukuda on guitar. It was at this point Wells adopted the name Wayne Static.

Static announced in July 2007 that he would begin a side project, Pighammer, but in a December 2007 interview with Ultimate-Guitar.com, Static stated: &quot;The Pighammer thing will happen when I have time. At the moment though, Static-X will remain my main priority.&quot; Static appeared on the cover of the 2009 Static-X release, &quot;Cult of Static&quot;.

His solo album &quot;Pighammer&quot; was released on October 4, 2011. As part of his &quot;Pighammer&quot; solo-project, Static formed a new line-up consisting of Brent Ashley on bass, Sean Davidson on drums, and Ashes on guitar. In 2012, this line-up went under the name Static-X for the Noise Revolution tour. However, in October 2012, the remainder of the tour was cancelled due to Static requiring medical treatment.

In an interview done on November 26, 2013, it was confirmed that Static-X disbanded in June 2013. According to Static, the disputes between himself and the band&#x27;s former bassist Tony Campos over the rights to the band name had gone too far, forcing him to disband the four-piece.

He had been set to play a co-headlining tour in the U.S. with Powerman 5000 in November 2014 with American Head Charge supporting them.

==Equipment==
===Guitars===

Static installed a single Seymour Duncan SH-6B &#x27;Distortion&#x27; humbucker in all his guitar&#x27;s bridge positions; until switching to EMG 81&#x27;s in 2012 after signing with Dean. His signature Epiphone, ESP LTD, and Dean guitars did not come with neck pickups as he did not use them.

Static used a Gibson Flying V from early in his career; seen in the videos up until 2003.

Static also used a Gibson Explorer; as seen in the music video for &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;.

In 2004, Epiphone released a Wayne Static signature Flying V Guitar. &quot;Special features on the Static model include a single volume control and one toggle switch for the two Epiphone USA pickups, no pickguard, Ebony fingerboard with no inlays, black hardware, Plain Black satin finish, and the Static-X logo on the headstock.&quot;

In 2007, ESP produced the ESP Ltd Static-600 Wayne Static Signature Guitar. It featured an Explorer-shaped body, single Seymour Duncan Distortion humbucker, and nickel/diamond-plated scratchplate covering the entire mahogany body, as seen in live photographs.

In 2009, ESP produced the ESP LTD Static-600V GMB as Static&#x27;s new signature guitar. It featured a Flying-V-shaped body with diamond plate metal screwed to the front of the body, black hardware, and Static X logo at the 12th fret.

In 2012, Static joined Dean guitars and started playing custom ML Modifier. Until his death, Static played Dean guitars as an endorsee. While Dean did not release a Static signature model, Dean did produce a series of custom models for Static; fitted with his standard single bridge humbucker and single volume control.

===Amps===

For his live tone, Static used a simple Marshall MG100HDFX. The MG100HDFX was one of the cheapest solid state amps made by Marshall during Static&#x27;s touring time with Static X. On tour, Static could easily and cheaply get a replacement if the amp broke. Amps breaking wasn&#x27;t a common problem as solid state amps like the MG100HDFX are less prone to breaking than tube amps, another reason for its selection.

Static&#x27;s cabinet of choice was the Marshall 1960A.

As of the &quot;Cult of Static&quot; tour in 2009, all of Static-X ditched the traditionally used touring amps and cabinets for a Line 6 Pod XT Pro direct to P.A. sound set up and maintained by longtime guitar tech Erik Fincher.

==Personal life==

Static was an atheist and pescatarian. After a brief courtship, he married adult film actress Tera Wray in Las Vegas on January 10, 2008. They lived in Joshua Tree, California. Static appeared as a mystery guest on an adult film Wray hosted called &quot;Radium Vol 2&quot;.

On January 13, 2016, Wray died in her friend&#x27;s Joshua Tree, California apartment from an apparent suicide. Her body was discovered in January 14, 2016.

==Death==
Static died on November 1, 2014, in Landers, California, three days before his 49th birthday. He had consumed oxycodone as well as alcohol that morning before going to bed with his wife. She woke up later that day to find that he had died in his sleep. His publicist issued a statement which claimed that Static and Wray had stopped using &quot;hard drugs&quot; in 2009 and that his death was &quot;not a drug-related incident.&quot; However, an autopsy later confirmed that Static had died of multiple prescription drug toxicity involving the opioid painkillers oxycodone and hydromorphone, the anti-anxiety medication alprazolam (Xanax), and alcohol. The report also noted that years of past &quot;chronic prescription drug and alcohol abuse&quot; was a contributing factor. Former Static-X members Koichi Fukuda and Tony Campos paid tribute to Static. Static was cremated in California. A memorial show followed in Los Angeles, and a family service followed in Illinois.

<doc id="351541" wikidata="Q639653" url="?curid=351541" title="VNC">
<text>VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse input from one computer to another, relaying the graphical-screen updates, over a network. Popular uses for this technology include remote technical support and accessing files on one&#x27;s work computer from one&#x27;s home computer, or vice versa.

VNC is platform-independent, with clients and servers for many GUI-based operating systems and for Java. Multiple clients may connect to a VNC server at the same time. There are a number of variants of VNC which offer their own particular functionality; e.g., some optimised for Microsoft Windows, or offering file transfer (not part of VNC proper), etc. Many are compatible (without their added features) with VNC proper in the sense that a viewer of one flavour can connect with a server of another; others are based on VNC code but not compatible with standard VNC.

VNC was originally developed at the Olivetti &amp; Oracle Research Lab in Cambridge, United Kingdom, whose developers subsequently created RealVNC Ltd and claimed VNC and RFB as registered trademarks in the US and some other countries. The original VNC source code and many modern derivatives are open source under the GNU General Public License.

== History ==

The Olivetti &amp; Oracle Research Lab (ORL) at Cambridge in the UK developed VNC at a time when Olivetti and Oracle Corporation owned the lab. Developers who worked on VNC while at the AT&amp;T Research Lab include Tristan Richardson (inventor), Andy Harter (project leader), Quentin Stafford-Fraser, James Weatherall and Andy Hopper. The name &quot;Virtual Network Computer/Computing&quot; (VNC) originated with ORL&#x27;s work on a thin client called the Videotile, which also used the RFB protocol. The Videotile had an LCD display with pen input and a fast ATM connection to the network. At the time, &quot;network computer&quot; was commonly used as a synonym for a thin client; VNC is essentially a software-only (i.e. virtual) network computer.

In 1999, AT&amp;T acquired the lab, and in 2002 closed down the lab&#x27;s research efforts. Following this, several members of the development team (including Richardson, Harter, Weatherall and Hopper) formed RealVNC in order to continue working on open-source and commercial VNC software under that name. , RealVNC Ltd claims the term &quot;VNC&quot; as a registered trademark in the United States and in other countries.

The original GPLed source code has fed into several other versions of VNC. Such forking has not led to compatibility problems because the RFB protocol is designed to be extensible. VNC clients and servers negotiate their capabilities with handshaking in order to use the most appropriate options supported at both ends.

== Design and operation ==

The VNC server is the program on the machine that shares some screen (and may not be related to a physical display: the server can be &quot;headless&quot;), and allows the client to share control of it. The VNC client (or viewer) is the program that represents the screen data originating from the server, receives updates from it, and presumably controls it by informing the server of collected local input. The VNC protocol (RFB protocol) is very simple, based on transmitting one graphic primitive from server to client (&quot;Put a rectangle of pixel data at the specified X,Y position&quot;) and event messages from client to server.

In the normal method of operation a viewer connects to a port on the server (default port: 5900). Alternatively (depending on the implementation) a browser can connect to the server (default port: 5800). And a server can connect to a viewer in &quot;listening mode&quot; on port 5500. One advantage of listening mode is that the server site does not have to configure its firewall to allow access on port 5900 (or 5800); the duty is on the viewer, which is useful if the server site has no computer expertise and the viewer user is more knowledgeable.

The server sends small rectangles of the framebuffer to the client. In its simplest form, the VNC protocol can use a lot of bandwidth, so various methods have been devised to reduce the communication overhead. For example, there are various &quot;encodings&quot; (methods to determine the most efficient way to transfer these rectangles). The VNC protocol allows the client and server to negotiate which encoding they will use. The simplest encoding, supported by all clients and servers, is &quot;raw encoding&quot;, which sends pixel data in left-to-right scanline order, and after the original full screen has been transmitted, transfers only rectangles that change. This encoding works very well if only a small portion of the screen changes from one frame to the next (as when a mouse pointer moves across a desktop, or when text is written at the cursor), but bandwidth demands get very high if a lot of pixels change at the same time (such as when scrolling a window or viewing full-screen video).

VNC by default uses TCP port 5900+&quot;N&quot;, where &quot;N&quot; is the display number (usually :0 for a physical display). Several implementations also start a basic HTTP server on port 5800+&quot;N&quot; to provide a VNC viewer as a Java applet, allowing easy connection through any Java-enabled web-browser. Different port assignments can be used as long as both client and server are configured accordingly. A HTML5 VNC client implementation for modern browsers (no plugins required) exists too.

Although possible even on low bandwidth, using VNC over the Internet is facilitated if the user has a broadband connection at both ends. However, it may require advanced network address translation (NAT), firewall and router configuration such as port forwarding in order for the connection to go through. Users may establish communication through virtual private network (VPN) technologies to ease usage over the Internet, or as a LAN connection if VPN is used as a proxy, or through a VNC repeater (useful in presence of a NAT).
In addition, the display that is served by VNC is not necessarily the same display seen by a user on the server. On Unix/Linux computers that support multiple simultaneous X11 sessions, VNC may be set to serve a particular existing X11 session, or to start one of its own. It is also possible to run multiple VNC sessions from the same computer. On Microsoft Windows the VNC session served is always the current user session.

In July 2014 RealVNC published a Wayland developer preview.

== Security ==
By default, RFB is not a secure protocol. While passwords are not sent in plain-text (as in telnet), cracking could prove successful if both the encryption key and encoded password were sniffed from a network. For this reason it is recommended that a password of at least 8 characters be used. On the other hand, there is also an 8-character limit on some versions of VNC; if a password is sent exceeding 8 characters, the excess characters are removed and the truncated string is compared to the password.

UltraVNC supports the use of an open-source encryption plugin which encrypts the entire VNC session including password authentication and data transfer. It also allows authentication to be performed based on NTLM and Active Directory user accounts. However, use of such encryption plugins makes it incompatible with other VNC programs. RealVNC offers high-strength AES encryption as part of its commercial package, along with integration with Active Directory. Workspot released AES encryption patches for VNC. According to TightVNC, TightVNC is not secure as picture data is transmitted without encryption. To circumvent this, it should be tunneled through an SSH connection (see below).

VNC may be tunneled over an SSH or VPN connection which would add an extra security layer with stronger encryption.

An additional security concern for the use of VNC is to check whether the version used requires authorization from the remote computer owner before someone takes control of their device. This will avoid the situation where the owner of the computer accessed realizes there is someone in control of their device without previous notice.

== Implementations ==
&quot;Xvnc&quot; is the Unix VNC server, which is based on a standard X server. To applications, Xvnc appears as an X &quot;server&quot; (i.e., it displays client windows), and to remote VNC users it is a VNC server. Applications can display themselves on Xvnc as if it were a normal X display, but they will appear on any connected VNC viewers rather than on a physical screen. Alternatively, a machine (which may be a workstation or a network server) with screen, keyboard, and mouse can be set up to boot and run the VNC server as a service or daemon, then the screen, keyboard, and mouse can be removed and the machine stored in an out-of-the way location.

Users commonly deploy VNC as a cross-platform remote desktop system. For example, Apple Remote Desktop for Mac OS X (and &quot;Back to My Mac&quot; in versions 10.5 through 10.13) interoperates with VNC and will connect to a Unix user&#x27;s current desktop if it is served with x11vnc, or to a separate X11 session if one is served with TightVNC. From Unix, TightVNC will connect to a Mac OS X session served by Apple Remote Desktop if the VNC option is enabled, or to a VNC server running on Microsoft Windows.

Other programs or software libraries which implement VNC include Krfb, Libvncserver, PocketVNC, Remmina, TigerVNC, TightVNC, VirtualGL, and Vinagre.

<text>A filename or file name is a name used to uniquely identify a computer file in a file system. Different file systems impose different restrictions on filename lengths.

A filename may (depending on the file system) include:
* name – base name of the file
* [[Filename extension|extension]] – may indicate the format of the file (e.g. codice_1 for plain text, codice_2 for Portable Document Format, codice_3 for unspecified binary data, etc.)

The components required to identify a file by utilities and applications varies across operating systems, as does the syntax and format for a valid filename.

The characters allowed in filenames depend on the file system. The letters A–Z and digits 0–9 are allowed by most file systems; many file systems support additional characters, such as the letters a–z, special characters, and other printable characters such as accented letters, symbols in non-Roman alphabets, and symbols in non-alphabetic scripts. Some file systems allow even unprintable characters, including Bell, Null, Return and Linefeed, to be part of a filename, although most utilities do not handle them well.

Filenames may include things like a revision or generation number of the file,
a numerical sequence number (widely used by digital cameras through the &quot;DCF&quot; standard),
a date and time (widely used by smartphone camera software and for screenshots),
or a comment such as the name of a subject or a location or any other text to help identify the file.

Some people use the term filename when referring to a complete specification of device, subdirectories and filename such as the Windows &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Chess\Chess.exe&quot;.
The filename in this case is &quot;Chess.exe&quot;.
Some utilities have settings to suppress the extension as with MS Windows Explorer.

==History==

During the 1970s, some mainframe and minicomputers had operating systems where files on the system were identified by a user name, or account number.

For example, on the TOPS-10 and RSTS/E operating systems from Digital Equipment Corporation, files were identified by
* optional device name (one or two characters) followed by an optional unit number, and a colon &quot;:&quot;. If not present, it was presumed to be SY:
* the account number, consisting of a bracket &quot;[&quot;, a pair of numbers separated by a comma, and followed by a close bracket &quot;]&quot;. If omitted, it was presumed to be yours.
* mandatory file name, consisting of 1 to 6 characters (upper-case letters or digits)
* optional 3-character extension.

On the OS/VS1, MVS, and OS/390 operating systems from IBM, a file name was up to 44 characters, consisting of upper case letters, digits, and the period. A file name must start with a letter or number, a period must occur at least once each 8 characters, two consecutive periods could not appear in the name, and must end with a letter or digit. By convention, the letters and numbers before the first period was the account number of the owner or the project it belonged to, but there was no requirement to use this convention.

On the McGill University MUSIC/SP system, file names consisted of
* Optional account number, which was one to four characters followed by a colon.If the account number was missing, it was presumed to be in your account, but if it was not, it was presumed to be in the *COM: pseudo-account, which is where all files marked as public were catalogued.
* 1–17 character file name, which could be upper case letters or digits, and the period, with the requirement it not begin or end with a period, or have two consecutive periods.

The Univac VS/9 operating system had file names consisting of 
*Account name, consisting of a dollar sign &quot;$&quot;, a 1-7 character (letter or digit) username, and a period (&quot;.&quot;). If not present it was presumed to be in your account, but if it was not, the operating system would look in the system manager&#x27;s account $TSOS. If you typed in a dollar sign only as the account, this would indicate the file was in the $TSOS account &quot;unless&quot; the first 1–7 character of the file name before the first period matched an actual account name, then that account was used, e.g. ABLE.BAKER is a file in your account, but if not there the system would search for $TSOS.ABLE.BAKER, but if $ABLE.BAKER was specified, the file $TSOS.ABLE.BAKER would be used &quot;unless&quot; $ABLE was a valid account, then it would look for a file named BAKER in that account.
* File name, 1–56 characters (letters and digits) separated by periods. File names cannot start or end with a period, nor can two consecutive periods appear.

In 1985, officially defined a &quot;pathname&quot; to be the character string that must be entered into a file system by a user in order to identify a file.

On early personal computers using the CP/M operating system, filenames were always 11 characters. This was referred to as the 8.3 filename with a maximum of an 8 byte name and a maximum of a 3 byte extension. Utilities and applications allowed users to specify filenames without trailing spaces and include a dot before the extension. The dot was not actually stored in the directory. Using only 7 bit characters allowed several file attributes to be included in the actual filename by using the high-order-bit; these attributes included Readonly, Archive, and System. Eventually this was too restrictive and the number of characters allowed increased. The attribute bits were moved to a special block of the file including additional information.

The original File Allocation Table (FAT) file system, used by Standalone Disk BASIC-80, had a 6.3 file name, with a maximum of 6 bytes in the name and a maximum of 3 bytes in the extension. The FAT12 and FAT16 file systems in IBM PC DOS/MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows prior to Windows 95 used the same 8.3 convention as the CP/M file system. The FAT file systems supported 8-bit characters, allowing them to support non-ASCII characters in file names, and stored the attributes separately from the file name.

Around 1995, VFAT, an extension to the MS-DOS FAT filesystem, was introduced in Windows 95 and Windows NT. It allowed mixed-case long filenames (LFNs), using Unicode characters, in addition to classic &quot;8.3&quot; names.

Programs and devices may automatically assign names to files such as a numerical counter (for example codice_4) or a time stamp with the current date and time.

The benefit of a time stamped file name is that it facilitates searching files by date, given that file managers usually feature file searching by name. In addition, files from different devices can be merged in one folder without file naming conflicts.

Numbered file names, on the other hand, do not require that the device has a correctly set internal clock. For example, some digital camera users might not bother setting the clock of their camera. Internet-connected devices such as smartphones may synchronize their clock from a NTP server.

==References: absolute vs relative==
An absolute reference includes all directory levels. In some systems, a filename reference that does not include the complete directory path defaults to the current working directory. This is a relative reference. One advantage of using a relative reference in program configuration files or scripts is that different instances of the script or program can use different files.

This makes an absolute or relative path composed of a sequence of filenames.

==Number of names per file==
Unix-like file systems allow a file to have more than one name; in traditional Unix-style file systems, the names are hard links to the file&#x27;s inode or equivalent. Windows supports hard links on NTFS file systems, and provides the command codice_5 in Windows XP, and codice_6 in later versions, for creating them. Hard links are different from Windows shortcuts, classic Mac OS/macOS aliases, or symbolic links. The introduction of LFNs with VFAT allowed filename aliases. For example, codice_7 with a maximum of eight plus three characters was a filename alias of &quot;codice_8&quot; as a way to conform to 8.3 limitations for older programs.

This property was used by the move command algorithm that first creates a second filename and then only removes the first filename.

Other filesystems, by design, provide only one filename per file, which guarantees that alteration of one filename&#x27;s file does not alter the other filename&#x27;s file.

== Length restrictions ==
Some filesystems restrict the length of filenames. In some cases, these lengths apply to the entire file name, as in 44 characters in IBM z/OS. In other cases, the length limits may apply to particular portions of the filename, such as the name of a file in a directory, or a directory name. For example, 9 (e.g., 8-bit FAT in Standalone Disk BASIC), 11 (e.g. FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 in DOS), 14 (e.g. early Unix), 21 (Human68K), 31, 30 (e.g. Apple DOS 3.2 and 3.3), 15 (e.g. Apple ProDOS), 44 (e.g. IBM S/370), or 255 (e.g. early Berkeley Unix) characters or bytes. Length limits often result from assigning fixed space in a filesystem to storing components of names, so increasing limits often requires an incompatible change, as well as reserving more space.

A particular issue with filesystems that store information in nested directories is that it may be possible to create a file with a complete pathname that exceeds implementation limits, since length checking may apply only to individual parts of the name rather than the entire name. Many Windows applications are limited to a codice_9 value of 260, but Windows file names can easily exceed this limit. From Windows 10, version 1607, MAX_PATH limitations have been removed.

== Filename extensions ==

Filenames in some file systems, such as FAT and the ODS-1 and ODS-2 levels of Files-11, are composed of two parts: a &quot;base name&quot; or &quot;stem&quot; and an &quot;extension&quot; or &quot;suffix&quot; used by some applications to indicate the file type. Some other file systems, such as Unix file systems, VFAT, and NTFS, treat a filename as a single string; a convention often used on those file systems is to treat the characters following the last period in the filename, in a filename containing periods, as the extension part of the filename.

Multiple output files created by an application may use the same basename and various extensions. For example, a Fortran compiler might use the extension codice_10 for source input file, codice_11 for the object output and codice_12 for the listing. Although there are some common extensions, they are arbitrary and a different application might use codice_13 and codice_14. Extensions have been restricted, at least historically on some systems, to a length of 3 characters, but in general can have any length, e.g., codice_15.

==Encoding interoperability==
There is no general encoding standard for filenames.

File names have to be exchanged between software environments for network file transfer, file system storage, backup and file synchronization software, configuration management, data compression and archiving, etc. It is thus very important not to lose file name information between applications. This led to wide adoption of Unicode as a standard for encoding file names, although legacy software might not be Unicode-aware.

===Encoding indication interoperability===

Traditionally, filenames allowed any character in their filenames as long as they were file system safe. Although this permitted the use of any encoding, and thus allowed the representation of any local text on any local system, it caused many interoperability issues.

A filename could be stored using different byte strings in distinct systems within a single country, such as if one used Japanese Shift JIS encoding and another Japanese EUC encoding. Conversion was not possible as most systems did not expose a description of the encoding used for a filename as part of the extended file information. This forced costly filename encoding guessing with each file access.

A solution was to adopt Unicode as the encoding for filenames.

In the classic Mac OS, however, encoding of the filename was stored with the filename attributes.

===Unicode interoperability===
The Unicode standard solves the encoding determination issue.

Nonetheless, some limited interoperability issues remain, such as normalization (equivalence), or the Unicode version in use. For instance, UDF is limited to Unicode 2.0; macOS&#x27;s HFS+ file system applies NFD Unicode normalization and is optionally case-sensitive (case-insensitive by default.) Filename maximum length is not standard and might depend on the code unit size. Although it is a serious issue, in most cases this is a limited one.

On Linux, this means the filename is not enough to open a file: additionally, the exact byte representation of the filename on the storage device is needed. This can be solved at the application level, with some tricky normalization calls.

The issue of Unicode equivalence is known as &quot;normalized-name collision&quot;. A solution is the &quot;Non-normalizing Unicode Composition Awareness&quot; used in the Subversion and Apache technical communities. This solution does not normalize paths in the repository. Paths are only normalized for the purpose of comparisons. Nonetheless, some communities have patented this strategy, forbidding its use by other communities.

===Perspectives===
To limit interoperability issues, some ideas described by Sun are to:
* use one Unicode encoding (such as UTF-8)
* do transparent code conversions on filenames
* store no normalized filenames
* check for canonical equivalence among filenames, to avoid two canonically equivalent filenames in the same directory.

Those considerations create a limitation not allowing a switch to a future encoding different from UTF-8.

=== Unicode migration ===

One issue was migration to Unicode.
For this purpose, several software companies provided software for migrating filenames to the new Unicode encoding.
* Microsoft provided migration transparent for the user throughout the VFAT technology
* Apple provided &quot;File Name Encoding Repair Utility v1.0&quot;.
* The Linux community provided &quot;convmv&quot;.
Mac OS X 10.3 marked Apple&#x27;s adoption of Unicode 3.2 character decomposition, superseding the Unicode 2.1 decomposition used previously. This change caused problems for developers writing software for Mac OS X.

== Uniqueness ==
Within a single directory, filenames must be unique. Since the filename syntax also applies for directories, it is not possible to create a file and directory entries with the same name in a single directory. Multiple files in different directories may have the same name.

Uniqueness approach may differ both on the case sensitivity and on the Unicode normalization form such as NFC, NFD.
This means two separate files might be created with the same text filename and a different byte implementation of the filename, such as L&quot;\x00C0.txt&quot; (UTF-16, NFC) (Latin capital A with grave) and L&quot;\x0041\x0300.txt&quot; (UTF-16, NFD) (Latin capital A, grave combining).

== Letter case preservation ==
Some filesystems, such as FAT prior to the introduction of VFAT, store filenames as upper-case regardless of the letter case used to create them. For example, a file created with the name &quot;MyName.Txt&quot; or &quot;myname.txt&quot; would be stored with the filename &quot;MYNAME.TXT&quot; (VFAT preserves the letter case). Any variation of upper and lower case can be used to refer to the same file. These kinds of file systems are called case-insensitive and are not case-preserving. Some filesystems prohibit the use of lower case letters in filenames altogether.

Some file systems store filenames in the form that they were originally created; these are referred to as case-retentive or case-preserving. Such a file system can be case-sensitive or case-insensitive. If case-sensitive, then &quot;MyName.Txt&quot; and &quot;myname.txt&quot; may refer to two different files in the same directory, and each file must be referenced by the exact capitalization by which it is named. On a case-insensitive, case-preserving file system, on the other hand, only one of &quot;MyName.Txt&quot;, &quot;myname.txt&quot; and &quot;Myname.TXT&quot; can be the name of a file in a given directory at a given time, and a file with one of these names can be referenced by any capitalization of the name.

From its original inception, the file systems on Unix and its derivative systems were case-sensitive and case-preserving. However, not all file systems on those systems are case-sensitive; by default, HFS+ and APFS in macOS are case-insensitive but case-preserving, and SMB servers usually provide case-insensitive behavior (even when the underlying file system is case-sensitive, e.g. Samba on most Unix-like systems), and SMB client file systems provide case-insensitive behavior. File system case sensitivity is a considerable challenge for software such as Samba and Wine, which must interoperate efficiently with both systems that treat uppercase and lowercase files as different and with systems that treat them the same.

== Reserved characters and words ==

File systems have not always provided the same character set for composing a filename. Before Unicode became a de facto standard, file systems mostly used a locale-dependent character set. By contrast, some new systems permit a filename to be composed of almost any character of the Unicode repertoire, and even some non-Unicode byte sequences. Limitations may be imposed by the file system, operating system, application, or requirements for interoperability with other systems.

Many file system utilities prohibit control characters from appearing in filenames. In Unix-like file systems, the null character and the path separator codice_16 are prohibited.

=== Problematic characters ===
File system utilities and naming conventions on various systems prohibit particular characters from appearing in filenames or make them problematic: Except as otherwise stated, the symbols in the Character column, and for example, cannot be used in Windows filenames.

Note 1: While they are allowed in Unix file and folder names, most Unix shells require specific characters such as spaces, &lt;, &gt;, |, \, and sometimes :, (, ), &amp;, ;, #, as well as wildcards such as ? and *, to be quoted or escaped:
codice_17 (example of escaping)codice_18 or codice_19 (examples of quoting)

The character (codice_20) was not allowed as the first letter in a filename under 86-DOS and MS-DOS/PC DOS 1.x-2.x, but can be used in later versions.

In Windows utilities, the space and the period are not allowed as the final character of a filename. The period is allowed as the first character, but some Windows applications, such as Windows Explorer, forbid creating or renaming such files (despite this convention being used in Unix-like systems to describe hidden files and directories). Workarounds include appending a dot when renaming the file (that is then automatically removed afterwards), using alternative file managers, creating the file using the command line, or saving a file with the desired filename from within an application.

Some file systems on a given operating system (especially file systems originally implemented on other operating systems), and particular applications on that operating system, may apply further restrictions and interpretations. See comparison of file systems for more details on restrictions.

In Unix-like systems, DOS, and Windows, the filenames &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; have special meanings (current and parent directory respectively). Windows 95/98/ME also uses names like &quot;...&quot;, &quot;...&quot; and so on to denote grandparent or great-grandparent directories. All Windows versions forbid creation of filenames that consist of only dots, although names consisting of three dots (&quot;...&quot;) or more are legal in Unix.

In addition, in Windows and DOS utilities, some words are also reserved and cannot be used as filenames. For example, DOS device files:
 CON, CONIN$, CONOUT$, PRN, AUX, CLOCK$, NUL
 COM0, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9
 LPT0, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9
 LST (only in 86-DOS and DOS 1.xx)
 KEYBD$, SCREEN$ (only in multitasking MS-DOS 4.0)
 $IDLE$ (only in Concurrent DOS 386, Multiuser DOS and DR DOS 5.0 and higher)
 CONFIG$ (only in MS-DOS 7.0-8.0)

Systems that have these restrictions cause incompatibilities with some other filesystems. For example, Windows will fail to handle, or raise error reports for, these legal UNIX filenames: aux.c, q&quot;uote&quot;s.txt, or NUL.txt.

NTFS filenames that are used internally include:
 $Mft, $MftMirr, $LogFile, $Volume, $AttrDef, $Bitmap, $Boot, $BadClus, $Secure,
 $Upcase, $Extend, $Quota, $ObjId and $Reparse

<text>Wisconsin Death Trip is the debut studio album by American industrial metal band Static-X, released on March 23, 1999, by Warner Bros. Records. The band was formed after lead singer Wayne Static and drummer Ken Jay met at a Virgin Records store in Chicago. After being introduced by the Smashing Pumpkins lead singer Billy Corgan, the two decided to head out west to California to enlist a lead guitarist and bassist. Once in California, Koichi Fukuda became guitarist, and not long after, they discovered Californian Tony Campos to complete the lineup as their bassist. Warner Bros. Records discovered the band in California and signed them in February 1998.

&quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; peaked at number 107 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Top Heatseekers chart, and was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2001. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Push It&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;, and &quot;Bled for Days&quot;.

==Background==
The album was produced by Ulrich Wild in eight weeks with a budget of $50,000; the band originally wanted Terry Date to produce, but couldn&#x27;t afford him, so they opted for his assistant Wild. The band wanted very &quot;machine-like&quot; sounding drums, but without the use of a drum machine: instead, they built their own triggering system from pieces of plywood and piezo microphones to record the kick, snare and toms into Opcode Vision. The cymbals were then played separately on top. Samples were programmed in by Static in an Alesis HR-16, while synth lines were produced by Fukuda with a Roland MC-303.

It features a song written by vocalist Wayne Static and drummer Ken Jay&#x27;s former band Deep Blue Dream, titled &quot;December&quot;. The crash-landing scene from the 1968 film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; was sampled in the intro of &quot;Sweat of the Bud&quot;. The intro for &quot;Stem&quot; was sampled from the 1989 experimental horror film &quot;Begotten&quot;. A sample of dialogue from actress Linnea Quigley from the 1988 film &quot;Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama&quot; appears in the outro of &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;.

==Title==
The album&#x27;s title was taken by the band from Michael Lesy&#x27;s 1973 book of the same name during a stay at Static&#x27;s sister Lisa&#x27;s apartment during a tour when they spotted the book on her table. Originally, the band - at the time called &quot;Static&quot;, which management deemed too common to be service marked - wanted to use the title as the band name, but the label deemed it too long.

The book, responsible for capturing the imaginations of the band and inspiring the album title, contains a collection of photographs cataloging deceased persons previously residing in the Black River Falls region in the late 19th century. When interviewed about the source of the title, Wayne Static explained, &quot;[It&#x27;s] actually a book title that we stole. It&#x27;s been out of print for about 20 years. It&#x27;s a historical book about life in this small town in Wisconsin from 1890 to 1900. And it&#x27;s about everything that happened, but it focuses on people dying and how they died. And there are pictures of dead people as well as stuff about natural disasters and fires and stuff like that.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;CMJ&quot; included the album in its &quot;Loud Rock &#x27;99 Top 5&quot; list, saying, &quot;Static-X&#x27;s industrial/metal hybrid uses a guitar sound that keeps its songs refreshingly large, loud and groovable.&quot; In 2018, Revolver include the album on their list of &quot;20 Essential Nu-Metal Albums&quot;. At AllMusic, Tim Sheridan called it &quot;Fast, cheap, and out of control. This is gutbucket thrash for the most jaded of teenaged parking lot dwellers.&quot; Robert Christgau claimed it was &quot;Horrorshow abuse in living stereo--they mean it, man.&quot; In 2021, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1999 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

==Singles==

&quot;Push It&quot; was the first single released from the album. The song features an array of sounds from industrial metal to the band&#x27;s &quot;evil disco&quot; style. Mick Olszewski directed the music video for the song, using clay figures along with shots of the band.

&quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot; was released as the second single from the album. The song kicks off with Wayne Static bellowing out the chorus and then transitions to the lead guitar riff. David Meyers directed the song&#x27;s music video, featuring creatures from the previous video. The video also includes Wayne Static playing a woman, and monkeys hidden throughout. This song, along with &quot;Push It&quot;, is credited with &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot;″s success.

&quot;Bled for Days&quot; was released as the final single from the album, although technically it was the first song released off the album on the &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; soundtrack. It was the auditioning song for Nick Oshiro&#x27;s enlistment into the band. The music video is composed of recordings from live shows, and the audio was spliced with the original album version.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Push It&quot; was used in the intro for the 2000 video game &quot;Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes&quot;, was included in the soundtrack for the 1999 film &quot;Idle Hands&quot; and was featured in the 2004 film &quot;Torque&quot;. A remix of the song &quot;Love Dump&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the 2001 film &quot;Valentine&quot;, as well as the 2009 video game &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Push It&quot; was made available as downloadable content in the music game &quot;Rock Band&quot;. &quot;Otsegolation&quot; was featured in the soundtrack for the American release of &quot;Omega Boost&quot; in 1999, and &quot;Bled for Days&quot; was included in the soundtrack for the films &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; and &quot;Universal Soldier: The Return&quot;.

<doc id="351547" wikidata="Q389578" url="?curid=351547" title="The Persuaders!">
<text>The Persuaders! is a British action comedy television series starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore, produced by ITC Entertainment, and initially broadcast on ITV and ABC in 1971. The show has been called &#x27;the last major entry in the cycle of adventure series that began 11 years earlier with &quot;Danger Man&quot; in 1960&#x27;, as well as &#x27;the most ambitious and most expensive of Sir Lew Grade&#x27;s international action adventure series&#x27;. &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; was filmed in Britain, France, and Italy between May 1970 and June 1971.

Despite its focus on the British and American markets, &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; became more successful elsewhere. It won its highest awards in Australia and Spain, and Roger Moore and Tony Curtis were honoured in Germany and France for their acting.

&quot;The Persuaders!&quot; used many of the resources of Moore&#x27;s previous show, &quot;The Saint&quot;. These included locations, and the idea of reusing many of the visible vehicles from episode to episode. The series&#x27; synth-laden theme music was composed by John Barry.

==Premise==
The Persuaders are two equally-matched men from different backgrounds who reluctantly team together to solve cases that the police and the courts cannot.

Danny Wilde, portrayed by Tony Curtis, is a rough diamond, educated and moulded in the slums of New York City, who escaped by enlisting in the US Navy. He later became a millionaire in the oil business, subsequently making and then losing several fortunes as a Wall Street investor. Curtis himself had suffered a tough childhood in the Bronx, and also had served in the US Navy. Curtis was 46 when he made &quot;The Persuaders&quot;, but he performed all his own stunts and fight sequences.

Lord Brett Rupert George Robert Andrew Sinclair, played by Roger Moore, is a polished British nobleman, educated at Harrow and Oxford, a former British Army officer and an ex-racing car driver, who addresses his colleague as &quot;Daniel&quot;.

A pair of globetrotting millionaire playboys, the men are brought together by retired Judge Fulton (Laurence Naismith) in the French Riviera. They instantly dislike each other and destroy a hotel bar during a fist-fight. They are arrested and delivered to Fulton, who offers them the choice of spending 90 days in jail or helping him to right errors of impunity. Grudgingly, Wilde and Sinclair agree to help Fulton to solve a case. He then releases them from any threat of jail.

The men develop a sparing affection for each other and soon stumble into more adventures, sometimes by chance, sometimes on commission from Judge Fulton. Although the Judge recurs in the series, he has no formal relationship with his two agents. Eleven episodes depict his finding a way to convince Wilde and Sinclair to act on his behalf. For instance, in &quot;Angie, Angie&quot; he easily convinces one of the pair. In &quot;The Man in the Middle&quot; he endangers his agents so that they &quot;must&quot; act on his behalf. When they are short of cash he lures them with money. In &quot;Powerswitch&quot; he manipulates events from the shadows, and Sinclair and Wilde do not know that he is involved.

Some episodes rely on Danny being mistaken for other people, usually by some bizarre coincidence. In &quot;Element of Risk&quot;, he is mistaken for a criminal mastermind named Lomax, played by Shane Rimmer. In &quot;Anyone Can Play&quot;, he is mistaken at a Brighton casino for a Russian spy paymaster.

In episode 12, &quot;That&#x27;s Me Over There&quot;, it appears that Sinclair has had a longstanding interest in crime-fighting, as he has had a dedicated telephone line installed for an informer on a master criminal. In episode 17, &quot;Five Miles to Midnight&quot;, Sinclair tells Joan Collins&#x27;s character that he is working for the judge because it has given him something worthwhile to do after his failed motor racing career. Wilde never reveals or explains his motives.

===Title sequence===
&quot;The Persuaders!&quot; titles and synthesiser theme, by John Barry, establish the background and current identities of the protagonists via split-screen narrative technique: two dossiers, one red, one blue, labelled &quot;Danny Wilde&quot; and &quot;Brett Sinclair&quot; simultaneously depict their lives. The younger images of Tony Curtis are genuine, whereas the images of Roger Moore (with one exception) were mock-ups created for the credits. As the biographies approach their current ages, a series of four short sequences combine live footage with torn newspaper clippings, connoting their excitingly peripatetic lifestyles. The conclusion shows them together enjoying a life of sport, drink, women and gambling. The titles were specifically designed so that neither actor would appear to have top billing, something both Moore and Curtis stipulated when they agreed to co-star.

The title sequence retains a certain cachet among professional film editors. In 1995, Peugeot released an advertisement for the 306 car, with the theme of the opening title sequence, the split-screen process and even the voice of Michel Roux, who dubbed Tony Curtis in the French broadcast of the original series. In 2007, France 2 satirically used it to introduce a report about relations between the newly elected French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his first Prime Minister François Fillon.

===Cars===
The protagonists drive signature cars. Danny Wilde drives a red left-hand-drive Ferrari Dino 246 GT (chassis number 00810). Brett Sinclair drives a UK-registered Bahama Yellow right-hand-drive 6-cylinder Aston Martin DBS (chassis number DBS/5636/R) with V8 wheels and markings. Both cars were provided to the show&#x27;s producers courtesy of the respective vehicle manufacturers. The grey Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow chassis no. SRH2971 seen in the episode, &quot; &quot;That&#x27;s me over there&quot;, &quot; is known as the most filmed individual Rolls-Royce motor car ever.

As with Simon Templar – Roger Moore&#x27;s character in the television series &quot;The Saint&quot; – Sinclair&#x27;s car has personalised number plates of his initials: Simon Templar&#x27;s were &quot;ST 1&quot;, Brett Sinclair&#x27;s are &quot;BS 1&quot; (except for one scene in the episode &quot;The Gold Napoleon&quot;, where the car is seen with its real UK registration number PPP 6H). The true owner of the index number of Sinclair&#x27;s car, Billy Smart, Jr., permitted its use in the series.

The Aston Martin from the show was sold by the factory after filming ended, via HR Owen in London, to its first private owner. It was restored in recent years by the Aston Martin factory, and is presently owned by divorce lawyer and art collector Jeremy Levison. Both Moore and Curtis had signed the underside of the car&#x27;s boot (rear luggage compartment): Moore at Pinewood Studios in May 2003; Curtis at Cheltenham Racecourse in October 2008. In 2013, the Aston Martin DBS was an invited participant at two of Europe&#x27;s most exclusive motoring concours, the Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este at Lake Como, and the Salon Privé Concours in London.

Danny Wilde&#x27;s Dino bears Italian registration plate MO 221400 (the &#x27;MO&#x27; component represents the province of Modena, which happens to be the headquarters and manufacturing base of Ferrari). The exact whereabouts of the Dino today is unknown, but it is believed to be in private ownership in Italy.

==Cast==

===Main===
* Tony Curtis as Danny Wilde
* Roger Moore as Lord Brett Sinclair
* Laurence Naismith as Judge Fulton

==Production==
The concept of &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; originated in one of the final episodes of &quot;The Saint&quot;, titled &quot;The Ex-King of Diamonds&quot;, wherein Simon Templar (Moore) is partnered with a Texas oilman (Stuart Damon) in a Monte Carlo gambling adventure. Pleased with that combination, Robert S. Baker and Lew Grade funded the new series. Unusually, production of the series began and continued without contracts among the producers and Moore. Moreover, Moore&#x27;s role as producer is not obvious from watching the series, but Curtis confirmed the fact: &#x27;Roger was always like the host with the show, because it was his company that was producing it. I would say he was the largest independent owner of it; Roger and his company owned it with Bob Baker, and Sir Lew owned the rest of it.&#x27;

Curtis became involved in the series because ITC knew it needed an American co-star to ensure the series would be picked up by US television stations. Initially, the role was offered to Rock Hudson and Glenn Ford, but they each rejected the part. ITC then asked the American Broadcasting Company for a list of suitable actors, which included Tony Curtis. He eventually agreed, and flew to the UK in April 1970 to commence location filming.

Filming was conducted on location in Europe (such as location filming in France, Spain, Sweden, and Italy) and at Pinewood Studios in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. In total, 24 episodes of &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; were completed; each cost £100,000, (or approx. £1,800,000 in 2007) to make. Only one series of &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; was made because Moore accepted the role of James Bond in the 007 franchise. In the DVD documentary, &quot;The Morning After&quot;, Baker stated that Grade was prepared to finance a second series, despite its failure in America, by re-casting with Noel Harrison, son of Rex Harrison, as a replacement for Moore. Baker states that he convinced Grade that the dynamic that Moore and Curtis had worked out was unique, and it was better to leave the series as it stood.

During &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;, Moore acted — officially and practically — as his own wardrobe stylist. It stemmed from genuine sartorial interests and because he was the director of textile firm Pearson and Foster. Every episode carried the closing credit, &#x27;Lord Sinclair&#x27;s clothes designed by Roger Moore&#x27;, with &#x27;Roger Moore&#x27; written as a large signature.

===Curtis and Moore relationship===
There is much speculation about the professional relationship between Moore and Curtis, on- and off-set. In her autobiography &quot;Second Act&quot;, Joan Collins detailed how they did not get along when she was a guest star. She cited Curtis&#x27;s foul temper as the reason why the set of the episode &quot;Five Miles to Midnight&quot; was tense. In a 2005 interview given to the British Film Institute, director Val Guest confirmed Collins&#x27;s assessment of Curtis: 

In his autobiography, &quot;Still Dancing&quot;, Lew Grade noted that the actors &quot;didn&#x27;t hit it off all that well&quot;, because of different work ethics. According to Moore&#x27;s autobiography, Curtis&#x27;s use of cannabis was so extensive that he even smoked it in front of a police officer while filming at 10 Downing Street. Despite third-party claims, Curtis and Moore consistently maintained they had an amicable working relationship. Moore said: &quot;Tony and I had a good on- and off-screen relationship; we are two very different people, but we did share a sense of humour.&quot;

In a 2005 interview, Curtis referred to Moore with affection and stated that he would not participate in a remake of &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; without Moore.

==Reception==

===UK and US===
Although the series was placed in the Top 20 of most-viewed television series in Britain throughout 1971, Lew Grade wanted it to do well in the profitable American television market. It followed his earlier series such as &quot;Man in a Suitcase&quot;, &quot;The Champions&quot; and &quot;The Baron&quot;. But &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; made little impact in America, airing on ABC on Saturday nights opposite &quot;&quot;. In an interview given in 2007, Curtis attributed the lack of success in the US to the ABC network failing to screen it at prime time. Shortly after the series&#x27; cancellation in 1972, Moore was cast as James Bond for the film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, in what would be the beginning of a successful seven-film run for Moore as Bond, putting paid to any chance of the series being resurrected.

ITC subsequently sought to repackage and re-release &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; in the American market, by editing eight of the episodes together and releasing them as four 90-minute TV movies (each comprising two episodes from the series, typically missing only their original opening and closing title sequences). These were:

*&quot;London Conspiracy&quot; (from &quot;Greensleeves&quot; and &quot;A Home of One&#x27;s Own&quot;. There is a piece from &quot;Angie, Angie...&quot;)
*&quot;Sporting Chance&quot; (from &quot;Someone Waiting&quot; and &quot;Anyone Can Play&quot;)
*&quot;Mission: Monte Carlo&quot; (from &quot;Powerswitch&quot; and &quot;The Gold Napoleon&quot;)
*&quot;The Switch&quot; (from &quot;The Ozerov Inheritance&quot; and &quot;Angie, Angie...&quot;) 
There was also a proposed fifth TV movie but was not completed this was
*&quot;The Persuaders&quot; (from &quot;Overture&quot; and &quot;The Man In The Middle&quot;)
But the trailer and opening is included in the 2006 Region 2 DVD/2011 Region B Blu Ray Network Special Edition set along with the 4 completed films and their trailers

*&quot;Death Becomes Me&quot; (from &quot;Someone Like Me&quot; and &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;)

===International distribution===
Despite the overall disappointment in the UK and US, &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; sold well in other international markets, particularly Continental Europe. This success allowed ITC to recoup much of its production costs, soon after principal photography was completed. The series has remained popular in Germany, Denmark, France, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Russia, Hungary and Italy; episodes are still regularly repeated throughout Europe. For instance, DR2 in Denmark rebroadcast the entire series on weekday early evenings during the spring of 2012.

In the UK, &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; had re-runs on Channel 4, Granada Plus, Bravo and ITV4 in the 1990s and 2000s. When the pilot episode, &quot;Overture&quot;, was screened as part of Channel 4&#x27;s nostalgia strand TV Heaven in 1992, that series&#x27; host (comedy writer Frank Muir) said in a &quot;Radio Times&quot; interview that &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; &#x27;must have been the best bad series ever made... absolute hokum&#x27;. However, BBC Radio 5 presenter Dave Aldridge later asked: &#x27;Was seventies TV really this good?&#x27;

===Redubbed versions===
&quot;Die Zwei&quot;, the German version of &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;, became a cult hit in Germany and Austria. This was largely because the dubbing was substantively altered, creating a completely different program. In France, &quot;Amicalement Vôtre&quot; (&#x27;Amicably Yours&#x27;) was based on the re-dubbed German version instead of the English original .

The German dubbing was described as &#x27;a unique mixture of street slang and ironic tongue-in-cheek remarks&#x27; and it &#x27;even mentioned Lord Sinclair becoming 007 on one or two occasions&#x27;. Dialogue frequently broke the fourth wall with lines like &#x27;Junge, lass doch die Sprüche, die setzen ja die nächste Folge ab!&#x27; (&#x27;Lad, just quit the big talk, or they&#x27;ll cancel the next episode!&#x27;) in S01/E05 at 44:36 or &#x27;Du musst jetzt etwas schneller werden, sonst bist Du nicht synchron&#x27; (&#x27;You have to speed up [talk faster] now, or else you won&#x27;t be in sync&#x27;).

Research from the University of Hamburg notes the only common elements between &quot;Die Zwei&quot; and &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; are the images. Other than &#x27;the linguistic changes entailed by the process of translation, result in radically different characterizations of the protagonists of the series. The language use in the translations is characterized by a greater degree of sexual explicitness and verbal violence, as well as an unveiled pro-American attitude which is not found in the source texts.&#x27;

In 2006, a news story by CBS News on the German dubbing industry mentioned &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; The report discovered that many German dubbing artists believed that &#x27;staying exactly true to the original was not always the highest aim&#x27;. Rainer Brandt, co-ordinator of the German dubbing of &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; and Curtis&#x27; dubbing voice, said: &#x27;This spirit was invoked by the person who oversaw the adaption and also performed [Tony] Curtis&#x27; role: when a company says they want something to be commercially successful, to make people laugh, I give it a woof. I make them laugh like they would in a Bavarian beer garden.&#x27;

Other researchers suggest that international versions of &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; were given different translations, simply because the original English series would not have made sense to local audiences. For instance, the nuanced differences between the accents and manners of Curtis, the American self-made millionaire Danny Wilde from the Brooklyn slums, and Moore, the most polished British Lord Sinclair, would be hard to convey to foreign viewers. Argentinian academic Sergio Viaggio commented &#x27;how could it have been preserved in Spanish? By turning Curtis into a low class Caracan and Moore into an aristocratic &#x27;Madrileño&#x27;? Here, not even the approach that works with &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; would be of any avail; different sociolects of the same vernacular will not do — much less in subtitling, where all differences in accent are irreparably lost.&#x27;

===Awards and accolades===
*Winner – Logie Award 1972 Best Overseas Drama (Australia)
*Winner – TP de Oro Award 1973 Best Foreign Series (Spain)
*Winner – Bambi 1973 for Curtis and Moore (Germany)

==Episode list==

Airdates are from LWT London. ITV. Regions varied date and order (Granada and Anglia, for instance, transmitted a day earlier). The production number refers to the order on Network&#x27;s DVD.

==Home media==
The entire series was remastered for DVD release in Europe in 2001.

In 2006, because of its popularity in Britain, a nine-disc DVD special edition boxed set was released, with extra material to the complete, uncut, re-mastered 24-episode series.

In September 2011, the Region B Blu-ray box set containing all remastered, restored episodes of &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; was released to considerable praise from reviewers.

In Region 1, A&amp;E Home Video, under license from Carlton International Media Ltd., released the entire series of the classic &#x27;70s British cult adventure series on DVD in two volume sets in 2003/2004.

On 10 September 2014, it was announced that Visual Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1 and would re-release all 24 episodes on DVD on 4 November 2014.

==Remake==
A motion picture was announced in 2005 with Steve Coogan and Ben Stiller. In 2007 Hugh Grant and George Clooney were later announced as the stars with Stiller attached as producer. The film was slated for a December 2008 release, but was never completed.

==In popular culture==
The John Barry theme tune was also used as the walk on music by British 2 tone pioneers The Specials.

The series&#x27; theme song was sampled in the video for the single &quot;Lavender&quot; by Snoop Dogg. Fellow rapper Tyler, the Creator also sampled the theme song in his song, &quot;Rise!&quot;, from &quot;Call Me If You Get Lost&quot; (2021). It was also used diegetically in the movie &quot;Nocturama&quot;, directed by Bertrand Bonello.

<doc id="351550" wikidata="Q162699" url="?curid=351550" title="Flag of Yemen">
<text>The national flag of Yemen () is the official flag of the Yemen. It was adopted on 22 May 1990, the day of the Yemeni unification. It resembles the Arab Liberation Flag that was used by the National Liberation Front. It served as the derivation for the flags of both North and South Yemen prior to their unification, and the distinctive elements of flag were removed in choosing the flag post-unification.

According to the official description, the red stands for unity and the bloodshed of martyrs, the white for a bright future, and the black for the supposed dark past. The flag is graphically identical to the flag of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1972.

The Federalization of Yemen or the Federal Republic of Yemen was the outcome of the National Dialogue Conference. The Dialogue members also agreed that Yemen would be transformed into a six-region federal system. The regions would be Azal in the North, Saba in the center, Tihama in the West, Aden and Janad in the South, and Hadhramaut in the East.

==Historical flags==
Before Yemen was unified into the present-day Republic of Yemen in 1990, it existed as two states, North and South Yemen.
=== North Yemen ===
==== Kingdom of Yemen ====

The Kingdom of Yemen was never a British protectorate, it was nominally part of the Ottoman empire until 1918 and was independent thereafter. Independently, here were two British protectorates (known as the Eastern and Western Aden Protectorates) which contained 24 sultanates, emirates and sheikhdoms in the hinterland of Aden.

The flag was in use until 1962 when the imam was overthrown and the Yemen Arab Republic was established. A civil war between republicans (supported by Egypt) and royalists (supported by Saudi Arabia) continued until 1970, with the royalist side continuing to use the flag of the kingdom.

==== Yemen Arab Republic ====
When the Yemen Arab Republic revolted against the imamate in 1962, a version of the Arab Liberation Flag with one green star in the center of the white band which symbolized unity and independence. 
=== South Yemen ===
The flag of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen in the South was a version of the Arab Liberation Flag with a light blue chevron which represented the people under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, with a red star next to the hoist representing the NLF itself and later the Socialist Party. The flag was adopted on 30 November 1967 when South Yemen declared independence from the United Kingdom until the Yemeni unification in 1990. It was used again for a few months in 1994 during the existence of the Democratic Republic of Yemen.

<doc id="351554" wikidata="Q333364" url="?curid=351554" title="Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster">
<text>Henry William Forster, 1st Baron Forster, (31 January 1866 – 15 January 1936) was a British politician who served as the seventh Governor-General of Australia, in office from 1920 to 1925. He had previously been a government minister under Arthur Balfour, H. H. Asquith, and David Lloyd George.

Forster was born in Catford, Kent. He attended Eton College and New College, Oxford, and in his youth played first-class cricket – in later life he served a term as president of the Marylebone Cricket Club. Forster was elected to the House of Commons in 1892, representing the Conservative Party. He was a Junior Lord of the Treasury under Arthur Balfour from 1902 to 1905, and later Financial Secretary to the War Office from 1915 to 1919. Forster was raised to the peerage in 1919, and appointed Governor-General of Australia the following year. Unlike his predecessor, Ronald Munro Ferguson, he faced no constitutional challenges and had no influence on the political scene. Forster travelled widely while in office and was popular among the general public, mainly concerning himself with ceremonial duties. He retired to England at the end of his five-year term.

==Background and education==
Forster was born at Southend Hall, Catford, Kent, the son of Major John Forster, an Army officer. He was educated at Eton and New College, Oxford. He was a first-class cricketer who played for Oxford University and Hampshire, as well as for various amateur teams as a lower-order right-handed batsman and an orthodox left-arm spin bowler. He served as president of the Marylebone Cricket Club. He was also keen on yachting and horse-racing.

==Political career==
Forster entered the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Sevenoaks at the 1892 general election. He held that seat until 1918, when he was elected for the new Bromley constituency. In 1901, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Kent. He served as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from August 1902 to 1905 in the Conservative Government of Arthur Balfour, and as Financial Secretary to the War Office from 1915 to 1919 in the wartime coalition government. In 1919 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Forster, of Lepe in the County of Southampton.

==Governor-General of Australia==
In June 1920 Forster was offered the post of Governor-General of Australia, which he accepted. Shortly afterwards, on 28 June 1920, he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). This was the first occasion on which the Australian government was genuinely consulted about the appointment of a Governor-General. The Colonial Secretary, Lord Milner, sent the Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, two other suggested appointments before Hughes approved of Forster. Hughes seems to have preferred Forster because he was a man of modest reputation whom he thought he could control. His reputation as a sportsman was also an asset.

Forster arrived in October 1920. He found that the congenial atmosphere of pre-war Australian politics had been shattered by the bitter battles of the wartime period. Hughes&#x27;s Nationalist Party dominated the political scene. The Labor Party had moved to the left in opposition and was now anti-imperialist and pacifist, and more markedly socialist.

But Forster played almost no direct role in Australian politics during his five years in the country. There was only one change of government during his term, when Hughes was replaced by Stanley Bruce in February 1923, and Forster took no part in the manoeuverings that led to the change. As Australia became more independent and more confident in its international relations, the role of the Governor-General as an overseer and intermediary declined. Forster&#x27;s predecessor, Ronald Munro Ferguson, had resisted this trend, but Forster was not a strong enough personality to do so.

Instead Forster&#x27;s role became more like that of a modern Governor-General: opening fetes, visiting hospitals, attending sporting events, hosting balls and banquets. As a result, he became considerably more popular than most of his predecessors, but exercised less real influence than any of them. Forster and his wife Rachel devoted themselves to charities, and Forster spent much time travelling to all the states and country areas, unveiling war memorials and making patriotic speeches. The day of the decorative Governor-General had arrived.

In 1925, a new women&#x27;s hospital in Redfern, Sydney was named the &quot;Rachel Forster Hospital for Women&quot; in Lady Forster&#x27;s honour. The hospital is now closed and the former site has been redeveloped. There is a &quot;Lady Forster Kindergarten&quot; in Elwood, Victoria, named after Lady Forster who was a leading supporter.

The Forsters departed Australia in October 1925, well liked but unremarked.

==Family==
Lord Forster married the Honourable Rachel Cecily Douglas-Scott-Montagu, daughter of the 1st Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, on 3 June 1890. After Forster&#x27;s return from Australia they settled near Southampton, and lived quietly until Forster&#x27;s death in 1936. Lady Forster was invested as a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 1926 New Years Honours List. She was also invested as a Dame of Grace of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.

They had two sons, John Forster and Alfred Henry Forster, who were both killed in the First World War, and two daughters, Dorothy Charlotte Forster and Emily Rachel Forster who married George Pitt-Rivers (his first marriage). As Lord Forster had no surviving sons, the barony of Forster became extinct on his death.

Henry Forster died on 15 January 1936 in London, aged 69. Rachel, Lady Forster, GBE, died on 12 April 1962, aged 93.

<doc id="351555" wikidata="Q1486268" url="?curid=351555" title="Owain mab Urien">
<text>Owain mab Urien (Middle Welsh Owein) (died c. 595) was the son of Urien, king of Rheged c. 590, and fought with his father against the Angles of Bernicia. The historical figure of Owain became incorporated into the Arthurian cycle of legends where he is also known as Ywain, Yvain, Ewain or Uwain. In his legendary guise he is the main character in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27;s &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot; and the Welsh Romance &quot;Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain&quot;, which corresponds to Chrétien&#x27;s poem.

==Historical Owain==
The chief references to the historical Owain appear in the poems of Taliesin, Urien&#x27;s bard. In one poem, he appears as the victor of the Battle of Alclud Ford. Another, &quot;Gweith Argoed Llwyfain&quot; (&quot;The Battle of Argoed Llwyfain&quot;), tells of Owain&#x27;s part in a battle between the men of Rheged under Urien and the men of Bernicia under &quot;Fflamddwyn&quot; (Firestealer), possibly the Anglian king Theodric. When Fflamddwyn demands hostages, Owain shouts defiance and inspires the men of Rheged to fight rather than give tribute to the English.

Taliesin also composed &quot;Marwnad Owain&quot;, an elegy to Owain. In the poem, it is said that Owain slew Fflamddwyn:

:Pan laddodd Owain Fflamddwyn Nid oedd fwy nogyd cysgaid
:Cysgid Lloegr llydan nifer | A lleufer yn eu llygaid
:A rhai ni ffoynt haeach | A oeddynt hyach na rhaid
:Owain a&#x27;u cosbes yn ddrud | Mal cnud yn dylud defaid

:When Owain slew Fflamddwyn it was no more to him than to sleep
:The wide host of Lloegr [England] sleeps with the light in their eyes
:And those that did not flee were braver than was needed
:Owain punished them harshly like a pack of wolves chasing sheep

He inherited the kingdom of Rheged when his father was killed, but was immediately beset by his British neighbours, Gwallawc Marchawc Trin of Elmet and Dunaut Bwr; the former attacking Owain&#x27;s brother Elffin whilst Owain and Pasgen, another brother, fought Dunaut.

Owain was slain in battle against his father&#x27;s old nemesis Morcant Bulc of Bryneich after a short reign. His death marked the end of Rheged as an effective power.

He is said to be buried at &quot;Llan-Forfael&quot; or &quot;Llan-Heledd&quot;, which local traditions place in the churchyard of St. Andrew&#x27;s at Penrith, though it is possible that the grave is actually that of the later Owen Cesarius.

Owain is said to be the father of St. Kentigern Garthwys by Denw, the daughter of &quot;Leuddun&quot;, commonly identified with Lot of Lothian. Owain is believed to have dressed as a woman and raped Saint Teneu, the mother of Kentigern.

==Owain of legend==
Over the centuries, the history of Owain known to storytellers faded sufficiently that he was incorporated into Welsh Arthurian legend and stories about him spread to continental Europe. Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot; and the related Mabinogion story &quot;Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain&quot; are devoted to his exploits, and he appears prominently in the Mabinogion tale &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot; and briefly in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. He also features as the knight Sir Owayne fytz-Vryene in the fifteenth century romance &quot;Awntyrs of Arthure at the Terne Wathelyne&quot;. The character is portrayed as an excellent knight in the later romances, the Lancelot-Grail cycle and Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, under one spelling of his name or another.

In &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot;, he plays a game of chess against Arthur while Rhonabwy looks on and the Saxons prepare to fight. The outlines of Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot; and &quot;Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain&quot; are essentially the same; Owain hears of a magical storm-making fountain in the forest of Brocéliande and seeks it out, only to find it defended by an excellent knight. He defeats this warrior and marries his wife Laudine, but forsaking his marital duties for knightly exploits, he loses her love. With the aid of a lion he rescues from a serpent, he completes several adventures and is eventually reunited with his lady. He appears in most of the later accounts, his importance indicated by his close friendship with Gawain and the passage in the &quot;Mort Artu&quot; section of the Lancelot-Grail cycle where he is one of the last knights to die before Arthur.

Almost all versions of the Arthurian story have Owain as Urien&#x27;s son and Arthur&#x27;s nephew, and the later accounts assume his mother is Morgan le Fay, if not one of the King&#x27;s other half-sisters. He has a half brother called Owain (or Yvain) the Bastard after him, the product of a union between Urien and his seneschal&#x27;s wife. The Welsh give him a twin sister, Morvydd, and as Arthur&#x27;s maternal nephew he is a cousin to Gawain and the Orkney clan.

<doc id="351556" wikidata="Q159651" url="?curid=351556" title="Anna Leopoldovna">
<text>Anna Leopoldovna (; 18 December 1718 – 19 March 1746), born Elisabeth Katharina Christine von Mecklenburg-Schwerin and also known as Anna Carlovna (А́нна Ка́рловна), was regent of Russia for just over a year (1740–1741) during the minority of her infant son Emperor Ivan VI.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Anna Leopoldovna was born Elisabeth Katharina Christine, the daughter of Karl Leopold, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, by his wife, Catherine, the eldest daughter of Tsar Ivan V of Russia. Catherine&#x27;s father, Ivan V, was the elder brother and co-ruler of Russia with Peter the Great, but because he was mentally challenged and unfit to rule, all power was in the hands of Peter the Great, who was like a father to Catherine and looked out for her interest as long as he was alive.

Elisabeth&#x27;s mother, Catherine, was the third wife of Duke Karl Leopold, who had divorced his first two wives after very short marriages (less than two years each). Catherine was the only wife ever to bear him a living child, and Elisabeth was the only child. In 1721, when Elisabeth was three years old, her mother became pregnant a second time, but the child was stillborn. By then, the marriage between her parents was in trouble, and in 1722, Catherine returned to the court of her uncle Peter the Great. She took her daughter with her, and Elisabeth, therefore, grew up in Russia with little or no contact with her father.

In 1730, Tsar Peter II, who was the last surviving male member of the Romanov dynasty, died unwed, and his dynasty died with him. The Russian privy council debated about whom to invite to the throne, and Elisabeth&#x27;s mother, Catherine, was one of the candidates who was considered. However, she was passed over for several reasons, and the throne was offered to her younger sister, Anna Ivanovna, who became known to history as Empress Anna of Russia. Anna was a childless widow, and Elisabeth was Catherine&#x27;s only child. Elisabeth&#x27;s position at court was, therefore, an important one.
In 1733, Elisabeth converted to the Russian Orthodox Church and was given the name Anna Leopoldovna, which was a compliment to her aunt, Empress Anna, and also to her father, Karl Leopold, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Her conversion to the Orthodox faith made her acceptable as heiress to the throne, but she was never actually declared heiress by her aunt. In 1739, Anna Leopoldovna, as she was now known, was given in marriage to Anthony Ulrich (1714–1774), the second son of Ferdinand Albert, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Ulrich had lived in Russia since 1733 so that he and his bride could get to know each other better. He was able to do so because he was a younger son, and it was improbable that he would be called upon to shoulder the responsibility of ruling his father&#x27;s principality. Both circumstances clearly indicate that Empress Anna intended her niece to inherit her throne, and was laying the ground for that by selecting a husband of suitable birth and situation and by observing him at close quarters for several years before the marriage was celebrated.

On 5 October 1740, Empress Anna adopted their newborn son, Ivan, and proclaimed him heir to the Russian throne. On 28 October, just a few weeks after the proclamation, the empress died after she had left directions regarding the succession and appointing her favourite Ernest Biron, Duke of Courland, as regent.

Biron, however, had made himself an object of detestation to the Russian people. After Biron threatened to exile Anna and her spouse to Germany, she had little difficulty working with Field Marshal Burkhard Christoph von Münnich to overthrow him. The coup succeeded, and she assumed the regency on 8 November (O.S.) and took the title of Grand Duchess. Field Marshal Münnich personally arrested Biron in his apartment, where the formerly-tyrannical Biron ingloriously begged for his life on his knees.

===Regency===
Anna knew little of the character of the people with whom she had to deal, knew even less of the conventions and politics of Russian government and speedily quarrelled with her principal supporters.

According to the &quot;Dictionary of Russian History&quot;, she ordered an investigation of the garment industry when new uniforms received by the military were found to be of inferior quality. When the investigation revealed inhumane conditions, she issued decrees mandating a minimum wage and maximum working hours in that industry, as well as the establishment of medical facilities at every garment factory. She also presided over a brilliant victory by Russian forces at the Battle of Villmanstrand in Finland after Sweden had declared war against her government.

She had an influential favourite, Julia von Mengden. Anna&#x27;s love life took up much time, as she was involved simultaneously in what were described as &quot;passionate&quot; affairs with Saxon Ambassador and her lady-in-waiting, Mengden. Anna&#x27;s husband did his best to ignore the affairs. After becoming regent, Anton was marginalised by being forced to sleep in another palace, and Anna took Lynar, Mengden or both to bed with her. At times, the grand duke would appear to complain about being &quot;cuckolded&quot;, but he was always sent away.

At one point, Anna proposed to have Lynar marry Mengden to unite the two people who were closest to her in the world together. The regent&#x27;s relationship with Mengden caused much disgust in Russia, but the French historian Henri Troyat wrote that amongst the many libertines of St. Petersburg, Anna&#x27;s &quot;sexual eclecticism&quot; in having both a man and a woman as her lovers was seen as a sign of Anna&#x27;s openmindedness.

More damagingly, many in the Russian elite believed that at the age of 22, Anna was too young and immature to be the regent of Russia and that her preoccupation with her relationships with Lynar and Mengden at the expense of governing Russia were making her a danger to the state.

Troyat described Anna as an &quot;indolent day-dreamer&quot; who spent her mornings reading novels in bed, got up only in the afternoon, liked to wander around her apartment when she was barely dressed and had her hair undone and was principally interested in reading novels. Anna&#x27;s preference for handing out government jobs to Baltic German aristocrats caused much resentment on the part of the ethnic Russian nobility, which, for neither the first nor the last time, complained that a disproportionate number of Baltic Germans held high office.

===Later life===
In December 1741, Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the Great, excited the guards to revolt and had already become a favourite of them. The coup overcame the insignificant opposition and was supported by the ambassadors of France and Sweden because of the pro-Austrian and pro-British policies of Anna&#x27;s government. The French ambassador in St. Petersburg, the marquis de La Chétardie, was deeply involved in planning Elizabeth&#x27;s coup and bribed numerous officers of the Imperial Guard into supporting it.

The victorious regime first imprisoned the family in the fortress of Dünamünde, near Riga, and then exiled them to Kholmogory on the Northern Dvina River. Anna eventually died of puerperal fever on 19 March 1746, nine days after the birth of her son Alexei after more than four years in prison. Her family continued in prison for many years. A further 18 years were to pass before her son, Ivan VI, was murdered in Shlisselburg Fortress on 16 July 1764, and her husband, Anthony Ulrich, died in Kholmogory on 4 May 1774 after spending a further decade in prison. Her remaining four children (Ekaterina, Elizaveta, Peter and Alexei) were released from prison into the custody of their aunt, Danish Queen Dowager Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, on 30 June 1780 and settled in Jutland, where they lived in comfort under house arrest in Horsens for the rest of their lives under the guardianship of Juliana and at the expense of Catherine the Great. The eldest of them had been only months old when she and her family had been placed in prison. The other three had been born in captivity. They were, therefore, not used to social life, and even after they had gained their freedom, they made little or no contact with people outside their own small &quot;court&quot; of some forty to fifty people, all of whom Danish except for the priest. None of them ever married or left progeny.

==Family==
Anna Leopoldovna had the following children:

* Ivan VI (1740–1764) (reigning Emperor 1740–1741)
* Catherine Antonovna of Brunswick (1741–1807) (released to house arrest in Horsens in Denmark in 1780)
* Elizabeth Antonovna of Brunswick (1743–1782) (released to house arrest in Horsens in Denmark in 1780)
* Peter Antonovich of Brunswick (1745–1798) (released to house arrest in Horsens in Denmark in 1780)
* Alexei Antonovich of Brunswick (1746–1787) (released to house arrest in Horsens in Denmark in 1780)

<doc id="351559" wikidata="Q378510" url="?curid=351559" title="Xiahou Yuan">
<text>Xiahou Yuan () (died February 219), courtesy name Miaocai, was a Chinese military general and politician serving under the warlord Cao Cao in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He is known for his exploits in western China (in parts of present-day Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi provinces) in the 210s, during which he defeated Cao Cao&#x27;s rivals Ma Chao and Han Sui in Liang Province and the surrounding areas, and forced several Di and Qiang tribal peoples into submission. He was killed in action at the Battle of Mount Dingjun while defending Hanzhong Commandery from attacks by a rival warlord Liu Bei. Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s death was highly dramatised in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, in which he was slain by Liu Bei&#x27;s general Huang Zhong during a surprise raid.

==Early life and career==
Xiahou Yuan was from Qiao County (), Pei State (), which is in present-day Bozhou, Anhui. He was a younger cousin of Xiahou Dun and a descendant of Xiahou Ying, who served under the Han dynasty&#x27;s founding emperor, Liu Bang (Emperor Gao). He once helped Cao Cao shoulder the blame when Cao committed a serious offence. Cao Cao later saved him. When a famine broke out in Yan and Yu provinces, Xiahou Yuan and his family were adversely affected. He decided to sacrifice his youngest son in favour of his deceased younger brother&#x27;s orphaned daughter.

In 190, when Cao Cao was raising an army to join the campaign against Dong Zhuo, Xiahou Yuan joined Cao and served as a Major of Separate Command () and Cavalry Commandant () under Cao. He was subsequently appointed as the Administrator () of Chenliu (陳留; around present-day Kaifeng, Henan) and Yingchuan (潁川; in present-day central Henan) commanderies.

==Mid career==
In 200, when Cao Cao clashed with his rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, Xiahou Yuan was appointed acting Colonel Who Inspects the Army (). After Cao Cao&#x27;s victory over Yuan Shao, Xiahou Yuan was put in charge of overseeing the transport of provisions from Yan, Yu and Xu provinces to Cao Cao&#x27;s armies at the frontline in northern China. Cao Cao&#x27;s forces were lacking food supplies at that time, but Xiahou Yuan was able to deliver the supplies in time and this helped to boost the army&#x27;s morale.

In 206, Chang Xi () started a rebellion, so Cao Cao sent Yu Jin to lead an army to suppress the revolt. Yu Jin was unsuccessful, so Cao Cao ordered Xiahou Yuan to join Yu Jin in a second expedition against Chang Xi. They defeated the rebels this time and captured over 10 enemy garrisons while Chang Xi surrendered to Yu Jin. Xiahou Yuan was appointed Colonel Who Arranges the Army () after his success. Xiahou Yuan was known for the swift movements of his units in battle, and he often took his enemies by surprise. There was a saying in Cao Cao&#x27;s army to describe this: &quot;Xiahou Yuan, the Colonel Who Arranges the Army, travels 500 &quot;li&quot; in three days and 1,000 &quot;li&quot; in six days.&quot;

In 207, Yellow Turban rebels in Jinan (濟南; near present-day Zhangqiu, Shandong) and Le&#x27;an (樂安; in present-day Shandong), led by Xu He () and Sima Ju (), attacked cities and killed officials. Xiahou Yuan led military forces from Taishan (泰山; near Mount Tai), Qi and Pingyuan commanderies to attack the rebels. He defeated them, killed Xu He, and pacified the various counties in the region. He also collected the enemy&#x27;s food supplies and distributed them among his own troops.

In 209, after Cao Cao returned from his defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs against the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei, he ordered Xiahou Yuan to lead an assault on Lei Xu, who had started a revolt in Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡; in present-day Hefei, Anhui). After defeating Lei Xu, Xiahou Yuan was appointed acting Protector-General Who Attacks the West () and ordered to lead troops together with Xu Huang to attack rebels in Taiyuan Commandery (太原郡; in present-day Shanxi). They conquered over 20 enemy camps, killed the rebel chief Shang Yao (), and massacred the population in the rebel base.

==Campaigns in western China==
In 211, Xiahou Yuan participated in the Battle of Tong Pass on Cao Cao&#x27;s side against a coalition of western warlords led by Han Sui and Ma Chao, in which Cao emerged victorious against the coalition. He and Zhu Ling later led a separate force to pacify the Di tribes in Yumi () and Qian () counties. Following that, he rendezvoused with Cao Cao&#x27;s main force in Anding Commandery (安定郡; covering parts of present-day Ningxia and Gansu), where they forced Yang Qiu, an ally of Han Sui and Ma Chao, to surrender.

In 212, Cao Cao returned to Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei), leaving behind Xiahou Yuan, Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao () to garrison in Chang&#x27;an. Xiahou Yuan held the appointment of acting General Who Protects the Army () at the time. He defeated a group of bandits led by Liu Xiong () in Nanshan () and forced them to surrender. He also besieged Liang Xing (梁興; an ally of Han Sui and Ma Chao) in Hu County () and defeated and killed Liang Xing. In recognition of his contributions, the Han imperial court enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Bochang Village ().

In 213, Ma Chao besieged Wei Kang, the Inspector () of Liang Province, in the provincial capital Ji (兾; or Jicheng, in present-day Gangu County, Gansu). Xiahou Yuan wanted to lead reinforcements to help Wei Kang but arrived too late as Ji had already fallen to Ma Chao while Xiahou Yuan and his army were still more than 200 &quot;li&quot; away from Ji. Ma Chao led an army out to face Xiahou Yuan. Xiahou Yuan would be unsuccessful against Ma Chao and he decided to withdraw his troops when he heard that the Di tribes in Qian County () had started a rebellion.

In 214, Zhao Qu (), Yin Feng () and several others, who were forced to submit to Ma Chao after he seized control of Liang Province, secretly plotted to drive Ma Chao out of the province. Jiang Xu started a revolt in Lu (鹵; or Lucheng, in present-day Li County, Gansu) to lure Ma Chao to attack him, while Zhao Qu and the others pretended to urge Ma Chao to lead his troops to Lu to suppress the revolt. Ma Chao fell for the ruse. Soon after he left Ji, Zhao Qu and the others turned against him and killed his wife and child(ren). At the same time, Ma Chao also failed to recapture Lu from Jiang Xu, so he became stranded.

Ma Chao retreated to Hanzhong Commandery, where he borrowed troops from the warlord Zhang Lu and returned to attack Jiang Xu and his allies at Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu). Jiang Xu sent a messenger to Chang&#x27;an to request for reinforcements. Xiahou Yuan and the officers in Chang&#x27;an held a meeting on whether to help Jiang Xu and his allies or not. Many of the officers thought that they should wait for orders from Cao Cao before making any move. However, Xiahou Yuan had a different opinion and he said, &quot;Our lord is 4,000 &quot;li&quot; away in Ye. By the time he receives our report, Jiang Xu and his allies are done for. Therefore, it is imperative that we send reinforcements to them immediately.&quot; He appointed Zhang He to lead 5,000 infantry and cavalry as the vanguard and head towards Mount Qi via a narrow pass at Chencang (陳倉; present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi), while he supervised the supply train and followed behind with another army. When Zhang He&#x27;s 5,000-strong army reached the Wei River, Ma Chao initially sent a few thousand Di and Qiang horsemen to resist the enemy, but later called for a retreat before both sides could engage in battle. Zhang He advanced further and seized the military equipment left behind by Ma Chao&#x27;s forces. When Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s army arrived, most of the counties in Liang Province had been pacified.

After the victory, Xiahou Yuan prepared for an offensive against Ma Chao&#x27;s ally Han Sui, who retreated when he heard of Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s approach. Xiahou Yuan captured Han Sui&#x27;s food supplies and pursued him to Lueyang County. Han Sui had set up a base some 20 &quot;li&quot; away from Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s position, so Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s subordinates urged their general to attack either Han Sui or the Di tribes in Xingguo (興國; northeast of present-day Qin&#x27;an County, Gansu). Xiahou Yuan chose neither of the two options as he knew that Han Sui&#x27;s troops were well-prepared for battle and that Xingguo&#x27;s fortifications were strong. Instead, he planned to attack the Qiang tribes in Changli (長離; along the Hulu River, Gansu). He pointed out that many of Han Sui&#x27;s soldiers were Qiang tribesmen from Changli, so they would return to save their home if they heard that Changli was under attack. If Han Sui&#x27;s troops decided to hold their current position, they would be isolated; if they came to defend Changli, Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s forces would be able to engage them in battle. Xiahou Yuan then ordered his subordinates to guard their supplies and heavy equipment while he led a unit of lightly armed infantry and cavalry to raid Changli, burning down many Qiang camps and killing many people. As Xiahou Yuan expected, the Qiang tribesmen in Han Sui&#x27;s army returned to Changli and encountered Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s army. Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s men were fearful when they saw Han Sui&#x27;s larger army, so they proposed setting up camps and defensive structures before fighting the enemy. However, Xiahou Yuan said, &quot;We&#x27;ve travelled over a long distance. Our troops will be worn out by the time they finish erecting these defensive structures, and won&#x27;t have energy left to fight the enemy. The enemy may have superiority in numbers but they are easy to deal with.&quot; He then launched an attack on Han Sui&#x27;s forces and scored a major victory over the enemy, capturing their flags and banners. After that, he returned to Lueyang County and laid siege on Xingguo. The Di chieftains in Xingguo fled to join Ma Chao while the others surrendered. Xiahou Yuan also attacked some Chuge encampments at Gaoping (高平; in present-day Guyuan, Ningxia), drove the Chuge away, and captured their supplies and livestock. The Han imperial court authorised him to oversee the affairs in the region.

During the Liang Province Rebellion in the 180s, a rebel chief Song Jian () declared himself &quot;King of the River Source Who Pacifies Han&quot; () in Fuhan County (枹罕縣; around present-day Linxia, Gansu). After Xiahou Yuan pacified Liang Province, Cao Cao ordered him to attack Song Jian. Xiahou Yuan besieged Fuhan, conquered the county within months, and captured and executed Song Jian and all his followers. He also sent Zhang He to force the other Qiang tribes in the region to surrender. By 215, most of western China had been pacified and submitted to Cao Cao&#x27;s control. Cao Cao wrote an order to praise Xiahou Yuan: &quot;Song Jian had been causing trouble for over 30 years. Xiahou Yuan eliminated him in one movement and made an unprecedented achievement. Confucius once said, &#x27;I cannot do as well as you.&#x27;&quot;

==Battles around Hanzhong==
In 216, the Han imperial court awarded Xiahou Yuan with an additional 300 taxable households in his marquisate, bringing the total number to 800. Subsequently, Xiahou Yuan led an attack on the Di and Qiang tribes of Wudu (武都; in present-day Longnan, Gansu) at Xiabian (), capturing over 100,000 &quot;hu&quot; (斛; a large unit of measurement) of grain. When Cao Cao led his forces to attack the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery, Xiahou Yuan led all the military officers and nobles in Liang Province to meet Cao Cao at Xiu Village (). The Qiang and tribal chieftains were fearful of Xiahou Yuan whenever they attended meetings with Cao Cao.

Zhang Lu surrendered to Cao Cao after his defeat at the Battle of Yangping. Xiahou Yuan was appointed acting Protector-General () and was ordered to pacify Ba Commandery () with the aid of Zhang He and Xu Huang. Cao Cao later returned to Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei) and left Xiahou Yuan and others behind to defend the newly conquered Hanzhong Commandery. Xiahou Yuan was appointed General Who Attacks the West ().

In 217, Cao Cao&#x27;s rival Liu Bei, who had taken over Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) in 215, launched a campaign to wrestle control of Hanzhong from Cao Cao. When Liu Bei&#x27;s forces reached Yangping Pass (陽平關; in present-day Ningqiang County, Shaanxi), Xiahou Yuan led his men to resist the enemy and both sides were locked in a stalemate for nearly a year.

One night in February or March 219, Liu Bei set fire to the barbed fences around Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s camp, so Xiahou Yuan sent Zhang He to defend the eastern part of the camp while he personally led a lightly armed force to guard the south. Zhang He attacked Liu Bei when the latter taunted him, but he failed to overcome the enemy. Xiahou Yuan then sent a fraction of his own troops to help Zhang He. Liu Bei&#x27;s general Huang Zhong launched a fierce assault on Xiahou Yuan even though his men had less battle experience than Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s troops. Xiahou Yuan was killed in action.

Xiahou Yuan was granted the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Min&quot; (), which literally means &quot;sympathetic marquis&quot;.

Cao Cao once gave the following piece of advice to Xiahou Yuan after he scored a series of victories: &quot;A general should consider his weaknesses, be prepared for situations in which he cannot win, and not rely solely on sheer bravery. Courage is a base instinct he should possess, but he should also use wisdom and strategy when he makes moves. One who knows only bravery is no more than an ordinary man who can fight enemies.&quot;

==Family==
Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s spouse was a younger sister of one of Cao Cao&#x27;s wives.

Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s eldest son, Xiahou Heng (), married a daughter of Cao Cao&#x27;s younger brother, the Marquis Ai of Haiyang (). Cao Cao favoured Xiahou Heng, who inherited his father&#x27;s title &quot;Marquis of Bochang Village&quot; (). His marquis title was later changed to &quot;Marquis of Anning Village&quot; ().

Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s second son, Xiahou Ba, served as a military general in the state of Cao Wei. He defected to Wei&#x27;s rival state, Shu Han, after the regent Sima Yi seized power from his co-regent Cao Shuang and became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Wei.

Xiahou Yuan had five other sons who were younger than Xiahou Ba: Xiahou Cheng (), Xiahou Wei, Xiahou Rong (), Xiahou Hui and Xiahou He.

Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s 5th son, Xiahou Rong (夏侯榮), was with his father during the Battle of Mount Dingjun. When he had heard of his father&#x27;s death, he was in such a rage he had to be restrained by his attendants. He then managed to break free and charge to the enemy with a sword in hand; he was also killed in action. He was only 13 years old (by East Asian reckoning).

Xiahou Yuan also had a niece, Lady Xiahou, who was around 13 years old in 200 CE. She was out gathering firewood when she was taken by Zhang Fei. She became Zhang Fei&#x27;s wife and bore him two daughters, who both later married Liu Shan and became Empress Jing&#x27;ai and Empress Zhang of the state of Shu Han.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Xiahou Yuan is featured as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. He made several appearances in the novel, notably one during an archery contest between Cao Cao&#x27;s officers at the newly made Bronze Bird Tower where he was shown as the most talented archer. But the most significant one was his death at the Battle of Mount Dingjun in 219. See Battle of Mount Dingjun#In fiction for details.

==In popular culture==
Xiahou Yuan is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. In the games, he is Xiahou Dun&#x27;s brother and is portrayed as being a bit hapless, but powerful and loyal nonetheless. He also appears in all instalments of the strategy game series &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and the real-time wargame &quot;Kessen II&quot;, all of which were produced by Koei.

Xiahou Yuan also appears as a playable character in &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;, and is prominently featured in the game as a general in the service of Cao Cao.

<text>Sungri Motor Plant, sometimes known as Sungri Motor Complex / Sungri General Motor Enterprise, is a 600,000 m2 vehicle factory in the city of Tokchon (덕천), North Korea. It was the most capable plant of the North Korean automotive industry before being surpassed by Pyeonghwa Motors. The plant produces urban and off-road passenger cars, small, medium, and heavy cargo, as well as haulage construction and off-road trucks and buses.

All models are reported to be replicas or derivations of foreign cars. Vehicles are generally for civilian and commercial use, as government officials favour foreign imports and the armed forces have their own facilities.

==History==

The Sungri Motor Plant was founded in November 1950 as the Tokchon Motor Plant (덕천자동차공장). It produced its first vehicle, a Sungri-58 truck, in 1958. In 1975, the plant was renamed &quot;Sungri Motor Plant&quot; (&quot;sungri&quot; meaning &quot;victory&quot; in Korean). In 1980, annual production was reported by the government to be 20,000 units per year, however the rate was more likely between 6,000 and 7,000 units per year. In 1996, production was crippled due to the country&#x27;s economic difficulties, with approximately 150 units produced.

On November 20, 2017, Kim Jong-un was reported to have visited and provided on-the-spot guidance at the Sungri Motor Plant.

In March 2021, it&#x27;s reported that SMP has a new production hall.

<text>Roobarb (also known as &quot;Roobarb and Custard&quot;) is a British animated children&#x27;s television series, created by Grange Calveley and originally shown on BBC1 just before the evening news. Each cartoon of the original series, written by Calveley and directed by Bob Godfrey, was about five minutes long. Thirty episodes were made, and it was first shown on 21 October 1974. The theme is that of the friendly rivalry between Roobarb, a seven-year-old green dog with an overactive imagination, and Custard, the mischievous eight-year-old pink cat from next door.

The series later spawned a revival in 2005, which aired on Channel 5&#x27;s Milkshake block. The narration of both series was provided by the actor Richard Briers. On 17 February 2013, Briers died, followed four days later by animator Godfrey.

==Original series==
Roobarb is a green dog, and Custard is a pink cat. Roobarb is always involved in some kind of misadventure which he approaches with unbounded enthusiasm. Custard is cynical and sets out to sabotage Roobarb&#x27;s fun. Which one comes out on top varies from episode to episode. Other characters in the series are the birds, who watch the antics of the other two from the safety of a nearby tree, often making snide remarks, and siding with whoever is winning. There is also a rather timid, pink mouse as well as the Sun and the Moon, who are depicted as sentient and able to talk to the other characters.

The series is animated in a deliberately rough style, using marker pens and a very sketchy drawing technique, so that the pictures are constantly &quot;shaking&quot;. This effect, known to animators as &quot;boiling&quot;, gives an energetic character to the show, and was a contrast to the slick, smooth colouring of the American Hanna-Barbera shows that were being shown on British television. The series was voiced by actor Richard Briers and the theme tune was written by Johnny Hawksworth for de Wolfe Music. It was the first fully animated television series to be made in the United Kingdom. The series was later shown in reruns on the American children&#x27;s television series &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot; on Nickelodeon, with an American dub.

The cartoon was a success, greatly loved by children and adults alike, and winning numerous awards. The series was also known for its eccentric use of quirky word play and sight gags.

==2005 series==
A new series titled Roobarb and Custard Too debuted on Channel 5 on 8 August 2005. Like the original series, it was written by Grange Calveley and narrated by Richard Briers, though Bob Godfrey did not return for this series. The revival introduced a large number of other animal characters who also got involved in Roobarb&#x27;s schemes. It was produced by Adam Sharp and Bernadette O&#x27;Riordan for A&amp;B TV, and directed by Jason Tammemagi; the animation was by the Irish company Monster Animation &amp; Design (now Monster Entertainment). The revival used computer animation, but kept the &quot;wobbly&quot; look and plain white backgrounds from the original series. The music for the revival was by Jon Atkinson. 39 episodes were made and clocked in at 7 minutes.

==Characters==

Roobarb
A green dog with a shaggy tail, two hairs each on the side of his head and a wild imagination. He&#x27;s fond of bones, adventure, inventing and also seems to eat various things like coal, paper, books, chairs, shoes, holes in carpets, trees. Despite being short-tempered, Roobarb is usually very good-hearted and seems friendly to everyone he meets. He loves performing shows and is often helpful.

His rival is Custard, his next door neighbour. Roobarb lives in a small cosy house, sleeps in a basket and seems to get on well with his rent free life. He&#x27;s not always very bright, but is always curious. Although anthropomorphic, Roobarb does usually run and walk on all fours, barks like a dog and even has his own dog bowl for water. Roobarb is always deep in thoughts, usually for long hours until a plan has been thought. Roobarb thinks he&#x27;s brave and handsome.

Custard
A chubby pink cat and Roobarb&#x27;s friendly rival and sometimes best friend. Custard usually likes to sabotage Roobarb&#x27;s fun and plays pranks on him and often looks for the biggest laugh of the day. Although malicious and sarcastic, Custard has been shown to care about Roobarb and has even helped him out a few times and enjoys his company. Examples include when he dressed up as Santa Claus for Roobarb&#x27;s Christmas party to help save it from being a disaster. Another example is when he helped Roobarb spook a group of tramps who retired to bed in Roobarb&#x27;s house.

Custard lives behind a large white wooden fence where he also takes his naps on top of it. Being a cat, Custard has a fondness for fishing, always trying to find his way to catch the fish, most of the time failing, he also envies Roobarb in competitions.

No. EUKV 2006) in October 1991, until it had a new re-release by 4 Front Video (Cat. No. 6356043) on 24 April 1995, until it was reissued by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (UK) Ltd (Cat. No. 0463463) on 16 June 1997.

In 1993, 4 Front Video released a single video containing 20 episodes of the 1974 series consisting of ten episodes from each of the two Channel 5 releases together in one video.

In 2000, Contender Entertainment Group Ltd released a single video with the first eight episodes of the 1974 series on it.

In 2024, digitally restored versions of the original, alongside the revival, have been released by Fabulous Films in the &#x27;Fabulous Films Kids Collection&#x27; range of children&#x27;s DVD and Blu-ray releases.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Noah and Nelly in... SkylArk&quot; episode &quot;During a Picnic&quot; features a pirate ship called &quot;The Nutty Dog&quot;, the figurehead of which looks exactly like Roobarb.

The Streets&#x27; song &quot;Turn the Page&quot; mentions &quot;Roobarb and Custard verses&quot;.

A sampling of &quot;Roobarb&quot; episodes and theme song made up the basis for the 1992 single of the same name by the UK group Shaft.

The end bit of the theme tune could be heard at the end of each of 3 adverts for Ambrosia flavored custard.

Roobarb and Custard were featured in the music video for &quot;The Official BBC Children in Need Medley&quot; by Peter Kay, which contained many other popular cartoon characters. They appeared via a televised monitor as they were in 2-D animation, as opposed to the stop-motion style of the video and characters.

Roobarb and Custard became the stars of a series of children&#x27;s books based on the TV series by Mogzilla Publishing in 2009.

The &quot;Roobarb&quot; theme tune appears in the Channel 4 comedy &quot;Spaced&quot; (Season one, Episode 4: &quot;Battles&quot;) in a flashback as Tim is chased by a pack of dogs, and also as Daisy chases the pack itself.

Roobarb and Custard were used as mascots for the People&#x27;s Dispensary for Sick Animals charity in the UK from 2011 to 2015. They were voiced by Ian Swann.

== Music by &quot;Roobarb&quot; ==
In 1975, singer-songwriter duo Sandy Davis and Paul Travis were commissioned to write and record an album for the &quot;Roobarb&quot; TV series. A single, &quot;Roobarb&#x27;s a Star&quot; was released in 1976, closely followed by the &quot;Roobarb&quot; album.

All releases feature original artwork by Grange Calveley, and was funded/released by Bell Records.

<doc id="351564" wikidata="Q930712" url="?curid=351564" title="Pileated woodpecker">
<text>The pileated woodpecker ( ; Dryocopus pileatus) is a large, mostly black woodpecker native to North America. An insectivore, it inhabits deciduous forests in eastern North America, the Great Lakes, the boreal forests of Canada, and parts of the Pacific Coast. It is the largest confirmed extant woodpecker species in North America, with the possible exception of the ivory-billed woodpecker, which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed be reclassified as extinct. It is also the third largest extant species of woodpecker in the world, after the great slaty woodpecker and the black woodpecker. &quot;Pileated&quot; refers to the bird&#x27;s prominent red crest, from the Latin meaning &quot;capped&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

The English naturalist Mark Catesby described and illustrated the pileated woodpecker in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; which was published between 1729 and 1732. Catesby used the English name &quot;The larger red-crested Wood-pecker&quot; and the Latin &quot;Picus niger maximus capite rubro&quot;. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he included the pileated woodpecker, coined the binomial name &quot;Picus pileatus&quot; and cited Catesby&#x27;s book. The specific epithet &quot;pileatus&quot; is a Latin word meaning &quot;-capped&quot;. The type locality is South Carolina. The pileated woodpecker is now one of six species that the International Ornithological Committee and the Clements taxonomy place in genus &quot;Dryocopus&quot;. The North American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society concurs for the pileated and lineated woodpeckers, the only two of the six that occur in Central and North America. However, BirdLife International&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; (HBW) places the pileated and several others in genus &quot;Hylatomus&quot;. Genus &quot;Dryocopus&quot; was introduced by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie in 1826.

Two subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;D. p. abieticola&quot; – northern pileated woodpecker, southern Canada south through the western, north-central and northeastern United States
* &quot;D. p. pileatus&quot; – southern pileated woodpecker, the southeastern United States

==Description==

Adults are long, span across the wings, and weigh . The average weight of females and males combined is about , with males weighing about and females weighing about in mean body mass. The wing chord measures , the tail measures , the bill is and the tarsus measures . The northern subspecies is generally slightly larger than the southern. Pileated woodpeckers are mainly black with a red crest, and have a white line down the sides of the throat. Younger specimens tend to have less curved crests, or &quot;mohawks&quot; as some refer to them. They show white on the wings in flight. The flight of these birds is strong and direct, but undulates in the way characteristic of woodpeckers. Adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat; in adult females these are black. Two species found in the Old World, the white-bellied woodpecker (&quot;D. javensis&quot;) and black woodpeckers (&quot;D. martius&quot;), are closely related and occupy the same ecological niche in their respective ranges that the pileated occupies in North America. The only North American birds of similar plumage and size are the ivory-billed woodpecker of the southeastern United States and Cuba, and the related imperial woodpecker of Mexico.

==Distribution and habitat==
The pileated woodpecker&#x27;s breeding habitat is forested areas across Canada, the eastern United States, and parts of the Pacific Coast. This bird favors mature forests and heavily wooded parks. They specifically prefer mesic habitats with large, mature hardwood trees, often being found in large tracts of forest. However, they also inhabit smaller woodlots as long as they have a scattering of tall trees. Efforts to restore woodland by removing invasive honeysuckle and buckthorn seem to benefit them, as the removal of brush and shrubbery facilitates their foraging on the ground and in the lower stratum. From 1966 to 2015 the population of pileated woodpecker has, on average, increased by greater than 1.5% per year throughout the northeastern U.S., the Maritimes, the Ohio River Valley, and around the Great Lakes.

==Behavior and ecology==
Pileated woodpeckers mainly eat insects, especially carpenter ants and wood-boring beetle larvae. They also eat fruits, nuts, and berries, including poison ivy berries. Pileated woodpeckers often chip out large and roughly rectangular holes in trees while searching out insects, especially ant colonies. They also lap up ants by reaching with their long tongues into crevices. They are self-assured on the vertical surfaces of large trees, but can seem awkward while feeding on small branches and vines. They may also forage on or near the ground, especially around fallen, dead trees, which can contain a variety of insect life. They may forage around the sides of human homes or even cars, and can be observed feeding at suet-type feeders. Although they are less likely feeder visitors than smaller woodpeckers, pileateds may regularly be attracted to them in areas experiencing harsh winter conditions.

Usually, pileated woodpeckers excavate their large nests in the cavities of dead trees. Woodpeckers make such large holes in dead trees that the holes can cause a small tree to break in half. The roost of a pileated woodpecker usually has multiple entrance holes. In April, the hole made by the male attracts a female for mating and raising their young. Once the brood is raised, the birds abandon the hole and do not use it the next year. When abandoned, these holes—made similarly by all woodpeckers—provide good homes in future years for many forest songbirds and a wide variety of other animals. Owls and tree-nesting ducks may largely rely on holes made by pileateds to lay their nests. Even mammals such as raccoons may use them. Other woodpeckers and smaller birds, such as wrens, may be attracted to pileated holes to feed on the insects found in them. Ecologically, the entire woodpecker family is important to the well-being of many other bird species. The pileated woodpecker also nests in boxes about off the ground.


A pileated woodpecker pair stays together on its territory all year round and is not migratory. They defend the territory in all seasons, but tolerate floaters during the winter. When clashing with , they engage in much chasing, calling, striking with the wings, and jabbing with the bill. Drumming is most common during courtship and to proclaim territory. Hollow trees are often used to make the most resonant sound possible. The pattern is typically a fairly slow, deep rolling that lasts about three seconds.

Pileated woodpeckers have been observed to move to another site if any eggs have fallen out of the nest—a rare habit in birds. The cavity is unlined except for wood chips. Both parents incubate three to five eggs for 12 to 16 days. The average clutch size is four per nest. The young may take a month to fledge. The oldest known pileated woodpecker was 12 years and 11 months old. Predators at the nest can include American and Pacific martens, weasels, squirrels, rat snakes, and gray foxes. Free-flying adults have fewer predators, but can be taken in some numbers by Cooper&#x27;s hawks, northern goshawks, red-shouldered hawks, red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, bald eagles, golden eagles and barred owls.

==Status==
The pileated woodpecker occupies an extensive range and is quite adaptable. Its ability to survive in many wooded habitat types has allowed the species to survive human habitation of North America much better than the more specialized ivory-billed woodpecker. Pileated woodpeckers have a large population size, and despite being nonmigratory, are protected under the U.S. Migratory Bird Act. While the large birds control many insect populations, especially tree beetles, that may otherwise experience outbreaks; some people may consider them harmful if found on their property due to the considerable damage that pileated woodpeckers can do to trees and homes.
==Cultural references==
Cartoonist Walter Lantz is believed to have based the appearance of his creation Woody Woodpecker on the pileated woodpecker; while patterning the call on the acorn woodpecker.

<text>Tŏkch&#x27;ŏn () is a &quot;si&quot;, or city, in northern South P&#x27;yŏngan province, North Korea. It is bordered by Nyŏngwŏn and Maengsan to the east, Kujang county in North P&#x27;yŏngan province to the north, Kaech&#x27;ŏn to the west and Pukch&#x27;ang to the south. It was known as Tokugawa during Japanese rule.

==History==

A 1984 survey unearthed fragmented pieces of pottery about 3km north from the Tokchon city limits dating from the Juelmun pottery period. However, little is known about the founding of the current city of Tokchon. The earliest records of Tokchon point to a Goryeo period founding of around with scriptures mentioning a fort named Bajung (바중) owned by a local lord c.950 A.D. The city was only named the current Tokchon during the Choson period (1392-1897). The city was heavily bombed by the USAF in the Korean War, with estimates of 65% of the city destroyed and 15-25,000 killed. On April 28, 2017, a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile launched from near Pukchang Airport reportedly crashed into Ch&#x27;ŏngsin-dong, Tokchon, damaging several structures in the city.

==Administrative divisions==
Tŏkch&#x27;ŏn-si is divided into 22 &quot;tong&quot; (neighbourhoods) and 10 &quot;ri&quot; (villages):

==Economy==
The Sŭngri Motor Plant (with associated workshops) has been one of the few domestic sources of both low-cost replicas of foreign passenger cars and military-service trucks in North Korea since it was established in 1950, and developed through the massive militarization campaigns of Kim Il Sung in the 1970s and 80s.

However, the total depletion of foreign credit by the end of the 1980s caused the manufacturing industry to implode; the supply of steel for metalworking at Sŭngri slowed to a trickle, and even when available, the production lines had regular power outages. The severe famine in the countryside also caused an exodus of starving peasants to the cities, further straining food supplies and worker productivity. 20,000 cars and trucks were made in Tŏkch&#x27;ŏn in 1980; by 1996 the number was just 150, all of which were Army trucks, some later modified as rocket artillery launchers.

==Transportation==
Tŏkch&#x27;ŏn-si is served by the Korean State Railway&#x27;s P&#x27;yŏngdŏk line and five branchlines.

<doc id="351572" wikidata="Q1430158" url="?curid=351572" title="Saint Etienne (band)">
<text>Saint Etienne ( ) are an English band from Greater London, formed in 1990. The band consists of Sarah Cracknell, Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs. Commonly associated with the indie dance scene of the 1990s, their music blends club culture with 1960s pop and other disparate influences.

Their debut album, &quot;Foxbase Alpha&quot;, was released to critical acclaim in 1991, featuring their most enduring hits &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Nothing Can Stop Us&quot;. It was followed by &quot;So Tough&quot; (1993), with the number twelve single &quot;You&#x27;re in a Bad Way&quot;, and the techno folk experiment of &quot;Tiger Bay&quot; (1994); both albums reached the top-ten. Their early period was rounded out by the gold-certified compilation &quot;Too Young to Die: Singles 1990–1995&quot;, producing the band&#x27;s highest-charting single, &quot;He&#x27;s on the Phone&quot; with Étienne Daho.

The band embraced indie pop on &quot;Good Humor&quot; (1998), with its lead single &quot;Sylvie&quot; reaching number twelve. By the new millennium, Saint Etienne had pivoted towards ambient music on &quot;Sound of Water&quot; (2000), while &quot;Finisterre&quot; (2002) and &quot;Tales from Turnpike House&quot; (2005) distilled these stylistic diversions and a return to their early influences. The 2010s, with &quot;Words and Music&quot; (2012) and &quot;Home Counties&quot; (2017), saw a contemporary update of their sound. The band incorporated samples for the first time in nearly two decades on &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Trying to Tell You&quot; (2021), which became their highest-charting album since 1994 at number fourteen.

The band&#x27;s name comes from the French football club AS Saint-Étienne.

==History==
Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs were childhood friends and former music journalists, who once had a fanzine called &quot;Caff&quot; which had developed into a record label by 1989. They originally planned that Saint Etienne would use a variety of different lead singers, and their 1991 debut album, &quot;Foxbase Alpha&quot; – influenced by sources such as club culture, 1960s pop, and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot; – features several vocalists, including Moira Lambert and Donna Savage. However, after working with Sarah Cracknell on &quot;Nothing Can Stop Us&quot;, they decided to make her the permanent vocalist, and Cracknell has written or co-written many of the band&#x27;s songs.

Saint Etienne were associated with the &quot;indie dance&quot; genre in the early 1990s. Their typical approach was to combine sonic elements (such as samples and digitally synthesized sounds) of the dance-pop that emerged in the wake of the so-called Second Summer of Love with an emphasis on songwriting involving romantic and introspective themes more commonly associated with traditional British pop and rock music. Early work demonstrated the influence of 1960s soul, 1970s dub and rock as well as 1980s dance music, giving them a broad palette of sounds and a reputation for eclecticism. Years later, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that they &quot;deftly fused the grooviness of Swinging Sixties London with a post-acid house backbeat&quot;. Their first two albums, &quot;Foxbase Alpha&quot; and &quot;So Tough&quot;, feature sounds chiefly associated with house music, such as standard TR-909 drum patterns and Italo house piano riffs mixed with original sounds, notable by the use of found dialogue, sampled from 1960s British realist cinema.

In 1991, the band also released two singles, &quot;7 Ways to Love&quot; and &quot;He Is Cola&quot;, under the name Cola Boy with different singers (one of them being future radio personality Janey Lee Grace, who recorded and appeared in the video for the former); their explanation for publishing under a pen name is that the tracks were &quot;too cheesy for Saint Etienne. We&#x27;d have been finished overnight&quot;. The band would later produce an updated electro-house version of &quot;7 Ways to Love&quot; for Japanese singer Nokko for her 1993 album &quot;I Will Catch U&quot; (also known as &quot;Call Me Nightlife&quot; for the United States, Canada and Europe), in which she added lyrics to the song in both Japanese and English.

During the early 1990s the group enjoyed extensive coverage in UK music weekly papers &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and gained a reputation as purveyors of &quot;pure pop&quot; in the period immediately prior to the Brit-Pop explosion. &quot;So Tough&quot; reached No. 7 in the UK Albums Chart. Their most popular singles of this period were &quot;You&#x27;re in a Bad Way&quot; and &quot;Join Our Club&quot; (which reached No. 12 and No. 21 in the UK Singles Chart).

&quot;Tiger Bay&quot; (1994) represented a change of direction: the entire album was inspired by folk music, combined with modern electronica. Although the album reached No. 8 in the UK Albums Chart, the singles performed disappointingly, with &quot;Pale Movie&quot;, &quot;Like a Motorway&quot; and &quot;Hug My Soul&quot; reaching No. 28, No. 47 and No. 32 in the UK Singles Chart. In a 2009 interview, Bob Stanley said that in retrospect the band &quot;got ahead of ourselves a bit&quot; by releasing such an uncommercial album, which &quot;definitely could have done with a couple more obvious songs&quot;.

In 1995, they released their most successful single, &quot;He&#x27;s on the Phone&quot;, a reworking of Étienne Daho&#x27;s &quot;Week-end à Rome&quot; that they had created for a collaborative EP with Daho entitled &quot;Reserection&quot;. It reached No. 11 on the UK chart.

Stanley has said that with hindsight it was &quot;a bit stupid&quot; that the band &quot;didn&#x27;t release another single for two and a half years&quot;. Instead, they released a compilation album, &quot;Too Young to Die&quot; (1996), contributed a song to the Gary Numan tribute album &quot;Random&quot; the following year, and then returned in 1998 with &quot;Good Humor&quot;, which de-emphasized the contemporary dance music influence on their previous work, replacing it with a more traditional sound. Also in 1998 they covered &quot;La, la, la&quot; on &quot;A Song for Eurotrash&quot;, a compilation of re-imagined past hits from the Eurovision Song Contest. (The song can be found on &quot;Fairfax High&quot;.)

In 2000, they shifted toward a more atmospheric type of electronica with the release of &quot;Sound of Water&quot;.

&quot;Finisterre&quot; was released in 2002. A follow-up DVD by photographer and film maker Paul Kelly was released in . In November 2004, they released their first US compilation of greatest hits, called &quot;Travel Edition 1990-2005&quot;. 13 June 2005 saw the release of the band&#x27;s album &quot;Tales from Turnpike House&quot;. It was preceded by a single for the track &quot;Side Streets&quot;. A second single, &quot;A Good Thing&quot;, was released in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2005. Early editions of the album were accompanied by a six-track sampler CD for a planned album of children&#x27;s songs entitled &quot;Up the Wooden Hills&quot;.

After years floating around various record labels, the band returned to its original label Heavenly for their 2009 career retrospective, &quot;London Conversations: The Best of Saint Etienne&quot;. The album contained two singles, a reworked &quot;Burnt Out Car&quot; and a new track, the Richard X-produced &quot;Method of Modern Love&quot;. The album also contained as a third &quot;new&quot; track, a remix by Richard X of the previously vinyl-only &quot;This is Tomorrow&quot;.

In May 2012, following the January release of the single &quot;Tonight&quot;, the band released their eighth studio album, &quot;Words and Music by Saint Etienne&quot;. Saint Etienne&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Home Counties&quot;, was released on 2 June 2017.

Their tenth album, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Trying to Tell You&quot;, was released on 10 September 2021. According to Pete Wiggs, the album was a lockdown project for the trio during the COVID-19 pandemic, prior to which they were working on a different set of tracks. In September 2021, he confirmed the group planned to revisit the material for a possible 2022 release. Their eleventh album, &quot;The Night&quot;, was released on 13 December 2024. 

===Collaborations===

1993&#x27;s non-album single &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; is a cover of a song by Candlewick Green. Saint Etienne recorded it as a duet with Debsey Wykes, former singer of Dolly Mixture. The song was also remixed by Aphex Twin.

In 1993, the band collaborated with Kylie Minogue for two songs: a cover of &quot;Nothing Can Stop Us&quot; (intended at the time to be her first single release for her new label) and &quot;When Are You Coming Home&quot; (unreleased).

The band also wrote and produced the 1993 single &quot;One Goodbye in Ten&quot; for Shara Nelson. The same year, the &quot;Xmas 93&quot; EP featured Tim Burgess from The Charlatans on the lead track &quot;I Was Born on Christmas Day&quot;.

In 1995, the band co-recorded the &quot;Reserection&quot; EP with French pop singer Étienne Daho; later, they also worked on his album &quot;Eden&quot; and single &quot;Le Premier Jour&quot;.

For the band&#x27;s first greatest hits compilation, &quot;Too Young to Die – The Singles&quot; (1995), Eurodance producer Steve Rodway reworked the track &quot;Accident&quot; from the &quot;Reserection&quot; EP, producing the renamed single &quot;He&#x27;s on the Phone.&quot; The single, co-credited to Daho, gained the singer additional exposure to English-speaking audiences.

In 2000, the band crossed genres by working with trance producer and DJ Paul van Dyk, resulting in the single &quot;Tell Me Why (The Riddle)&quot;, with vocals by Cracknell.

The 2005 album &quot;Tales from Turnpike House&quot; features David Essex as a guest vocalist. Several tracks on the album were co-written and co-produced by Brian Higgins&#x27; songwriting production team, Xenomania.

Sarah Cracknell has collaborated with Marc Almond on his single &quot;I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten&quot; for his album &quot;Stardom Road&quot;.

In addition to the Richard X collaboration on the &quot;This is Tomorrow&quot;/&quot;Method of Modern Love&quot; single, 2009 also saw the limited release of &quot;Foxbase Beta&quot;, the producer&#x27;s reworking of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Foxbase Alpha&quot;.

&quot;Home Counties&quot;, released in June 2017, features collaborations with London band Kero Kero Bonito.

===Film and television work===
The 1998 album &quot;The Misadventures of Saint Etienne&quot; is the soundtrack to the independent film &quot;The Misadventures of Margaret&quot;, starring Parker Posey. After the soundtrack was completed, the film&#x27;s producers opted to replace it with a more &quot;conventional&quot; soundtrack, but a number of tracks can still be heard in the background of the film&#x27;s final version, and Saint Etienne received top &quot;original music&quot; credit on the film. The band also recorded a duet by Cracknell and Posey titled &quot;Secret Love&quot; for the soundtrack, but due to legal entanglements it has never been released.

The band recorded the theme song and incidental music for &quot;Maryoku Yummy&quot;, a 2010 children&#x27;s television show that aired on Tiny Pop and The Hub.

The band has also been involved directly in film production, notably collaborating with filmmaker Paul Kelly on several short films documenting the landscape and history of London. The first of these was &quot;Finisterre&quot; (2002), set to songs from the album of the same name, inspired by the 1967 film &quot;The London Nobody Knows&quot; and Patrick Keiller&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;London&quot;. A series of three-minute films entitled &quot;Today&#x27;s Special&quot; (2004) documented &quot;London&#x27;s disappearing cafés&quot;, while &quot;What Have You Done Today, Mervyn Day?&quot; (2005) looked at the landscape of the Lower Lea Valley, which was about to be transformed by the 2012 London Olympics. The band then revisited the area in 2012 for a short entitled &quot;Seven Summers&quot;.

In 2007, the band produced &quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot; in their capacity as artists-in-residence at the newly refurbished Royal Festival Hall, telling the story of the Hall&#x27;s first 50 years. &quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot; premiered on 29 June 2007 as part of the Hall&#x27;s opening season with the band performing the film soundtrack live. Most recently, in 2014, Saint Etienne and Kelly collaborated on &quot;How We Used To Live&quot;, a view of London from 1945 to 1980, making extensive use of archive film.

The band&#x27;s most recent film is &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Trying to Tell You&quot; (2021), directed by Alasdair McLellan and set to the music of the album of the same name. Unlike their previous films, it was filmed all around England; its premise was memories of teenage years and the late 1990s.

====Songs in other films and television====

&quot;Like a Motorway&quot; appears on the soundtrack of the 1994 film &quot;Speed&quot;, although the single is never heard in the actual film itself.

Their song &quot;Hobart Paving&quot;, with slightly altered lyrics (replacing the title lyric with the line &quot;Hold on princess...&quot;) and an altered title (&quot;Catch Me&quot;), was covered for the soundtrack of the 1997 film &quot;Bandits&quot;, and was an integral part of the soundtrack album (one of two promotional videos released for the soundtrack was for the song), which became the best-selling soundtrack album to a European film soon after release. Actor/musician Jasmin Tabatabai still performs that version in concert.

&quot;We&#x27;re in the City&quot; from the &quot;Places to Visit&quot; EP is featured in Jamie Babbit&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot;. Also in 1999, &quot;Wood Cabin&quot; from the &quot;Good Humor&quot; album appeared in &quot;I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano&quot;, the first season finale of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

&quot;A Good Thing&quot;, co-written by Cracknell, Mark Waterfield and Lawrence Oakley, is featured in Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;Volver&quot; and in the &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Tell Me Sweet Little Lies&quot;.

<text>A henge loosely describes one of three related types of Neolithic earthwork. The essential characteristic of all three is that they feature a ring-shaped bank and ditch, with the ditch inside the bank. Because the internal ditches would have served defensive purposes poorly, henges are not considered to have been defensive constructions (cf. circular rampart). The three henge types are as follows, with the figure in brackets being the approximate diameter of the central flat area:
# Henge (&gt; ). The word &quot;henge&quot; refers to a particular type of earthwork of the Neolithic period, typically consisting of a roughly circular or oval-shaped bank with an internal ditch surrounding a central flat area of more than in diameter. There is typically little if any evidence of occupation in a henge, although they may contain ritual structures such as stone circles, timber circles and coves. Henge monument is sometimes used as a synonym for henge. Henges sometimes, but by no means always, featured stone or timber circles, and circle henge is sometimes used to describe these structures. The three largest stone circles in Britain (Avebury, the Great Circle at Stanton Drew stone circles, and the Ring of Brodgar) are each within a henge. Examples of henges without significant internal monuments are the three henges of Thornborough Henges. Although having given its name to the word &quot;henge&quot;, Stonehenge is atypical in that the ditch is outside the main earthwork bank.
# Hengiform monument (). Like an ordinary henge, except the central flat area is between 5 and 20 m (16–66 ft) in diameter, they comprise a modest earthwork with a fairly wide outer bank. The terms mini-henge (also &quot;minihenge&quot;) or Dorchester henge are sometimes used as synonyms for hengiform monument. An example is the Neolithic site at Wormy Hillock Henge.
# Henge enclosure (&gt; ). A Neolithic ring earthwork with the ditch inside the bank, with the central flat area having abundant evidence of occupation and usually being more than in diameter. Some true henges are as large as this (e.g., Avebury), but lack evidence of domestic occupation. Super-henge or &quot;superhenge&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for a henge enclosure. However, sometimes the term is used to indicate size alone rather than use, e.g. &quot;Marden henge ... is the least understood of the four British &#x27;superhenges&#x27; (the others being Avebury, Durrington Walls and Mount Pleasant Henge)&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;henge&quot; is a backformation from Stonehenge, the famous monument in Wiltshire. Stonehenge is not a true henge, as its ditch runs outside its bank, although there is a small extant external bank as well. The term was first coined in 1932 by Thomas Kendrick, who later became the Keeper of British Antiquities at the British Museum. A broader usage of &quot;henge&quot; to refer to standing-stone monuments was recorded in Yorkshire in 1740, from Old English usage dating to at least the 10th century, with a root of either , or .

==Forms==

Henges may be classified as follows:
* Class I henges, which have a single entrance created from a gap in the bank;
* Class II henges which have two entrances, diametrically opposite each other;
* Class III henges, which have four entrances, facing each other in pairs.

Sub groups exist for these when two or three internal ditches are present rather than one. Henges are usually associated with the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, and especially with the pottery of this period: Grooved Ware, Impressed Wares (formerly known as Peterborough Ware), and Beakers. Sites such as Stonehenge also provide evidence of activity from the later Bronze Age Wessex culture.

Henges often contain evidence of a variety of internal features, including timber or stone circles, pits, or burials, which may pre- or post-date the henge enclosure. A henge should not be confused with a stone circle within it, as henges and stone circles can exist together or separately. At Arbor Low in Derbyshire, all the stones except one are laid flat and do not seem to have been erected, as no stone holes have been found. Elsewhere, often only the stone holes remain to indicate a former circle.

Some of the best-known henges are at:
* Avebury, about north of Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, in Wiltshire
* Knowlton Circles, henge complex in Dorset
* Maumbury Rings in Dorset (later reused as a Roman amphitheatre and then as a Civil War fort)
* Mayburgh Henge in Cumbria
* The Ring of Brodgar in Orkney
* Thornborough Henges complex in Yorkshire

Henges sometimes formed part of a ritual landscape or complex, with other Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments inside and outside the henge. Earlier monuments associated with a later henge might include Neolithic monuments such as a cursus (e.g., at Thornborough Henges the central henge overlies the cursus), or a long barrow, such as the West Kennet Long Barrow at Avebury, Wiltshire, or, as in the case of Stonehenge, Mesolithic post holes. A circle of large pits across is centered on Durrington Walls henge. Later monuments added after the henge was built might include Bronze Age cairns as at Arbor Low.

Examples of such ritual landscapes are:
* Balfarg in Fife, Scotland
* Dunragit archaeological excavation site in Wigtownshire
* Heart of Neolithic Orkney, the UNESCO World Heritage Site on the Mainland, one of the islands of Orkney, Scotland
* Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites, the UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Wiltshire, England
* already mentioned: Arbor Low, Knowlton Circles, Stanton Drew stone circles, and Thornborough Henges

Burials have been recorded at a number of excavated henges, both pre-dating the henge and as a result of secondary reuse. For example:
*At Avebury, at least two very disturbed inhumations were found in the central area 
*Cairnpapple and North Mains both had some burials that pre-date the henges, as well others that post-date them
*At King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table, Cumbria, a cremation trench lay within the monument 
*At Woodhenge, a central burial of a child was interpreted by its excavators as a dedicatory offering 
*At Maxey, two cremation pit circles in the southern half of the henge, burials was also present within this monument

==Origin and distribution==

Efforts to delineate a direct lineage for the henge from earlier enclosures have not been conclusive. Their chronological overlap with older structures makes it difficult to classify them as a coherent tradition. They seem to take the concept of creating a space separate from the outside world one step further than the causewayed enclosure, and they focus attention on an internal point. In some cases, the construction of the bank and ditch was a stage that followed other activity on the site. At Balfarg, North Mains, and Cairnpapple, for example, earlier cremations and deliberate smashing of pottery predate the enclosure.

Concentrations of henges occur over much of Britain. Orkney (Cunliffe 2001) and Wessex (Burl 1969) have both been suggested as the original provenance of the monument type; however, others remain unconvinced (Barclay 2005). Unlike earlier enclosure monuments, henges were not usually built on hilltops but on low-lying ground, often close to watercourses and good agricultural land.

Some scholars, such as the editors of the 1982 edition of the &quot;Penguin Dictionary of Archaeology&quot; (Bray and Trump, 1982), have claimed that henges are unique to the British Isles. They state that similar, much earlier, circles on the European continent, such as Goseck circle (which has no bank), and later ones such as Goloring are not proper &quot;henges&quot;. But &quot;The Penguin Archaeological Guide&quot; (Bahn, 2001) does not comment on geographical locations for henges.
Julian Cope, in &quot;The Megalithic European&quot;, proposes that the henge was a regional development from the Europe-wide causewayed enclosure. He notes it appeared following a cultural upheaval in around 3000 BC, which inspired the peoples of Neolithic Europe to develop more independently. He notes the rondel enclosures of Bavaria&#x27;s Isar Valley, which according to investigations by the German archaeologist R. A. Maier, &quot;drew comparisons with the henge monuments and causewayed enclosures of the British Isles.&quot; Although still with a multiple-causewayed ditch and entrances at cardinal points, the roundels are described by John Hodgson (2003) as not being positioned with defensive aims in mind. The largest, at Kothingeichendorf, appeared to be &quot;midway between a henge and a causewayed enclosure&quot;.

Alasdair Whittle (2005) also views the development of the henge as a regional variation within a European tradition that included a variety of ditched enclosures. He notes that henges and the grooved ware pottery often found at them are two examples of the British Neolithic not found on the Continent. Caroline Malone (2001) also says that henges were not built in the rest of Western Europe, but they developed from a broader tradition of enclosure to become &quot;a phenomenon of the British Isles, a native tradition with sophisticated architecture and calendrical functions.&quot;

==Interpretation==

Henges may have been used for rituals or astronomical observation rather than day-to-day activity. That their ditches are located inside their banks indicates that they were not used for defence, and that the barrier of the earthworks was more likely symbolic than functional. Following arguments presented for Irish Iron Age enclosures, Barclay suggested that they are &#x27;defensive&#x27;: that the ditch and bank face something &#x27;dangerous&#x27; inside the enclosure. He has also suggested that the considerable range of elements surrounded by the earthworks, and the very long date range, are because henges were designed mainly to enclose pre-existing ceremonial sites that were seen as &#x27;ritually charged&#x27; and therefore dangerous to people. It has been conjectured that whatever took place inside the enclosures was intended to be separate from the outside world and perhaps known only to select individuals or groups.

The alignment of henges is a contentious issue. Popular belief is that their entrances point towards certain heavenly bodies. But henge orientation is highly variable and may have been determined more by local topography than by desire for symbolic orientation. Statistical analysis showed that Class I henges have a slight tendency to have an entrance set in the north or north-east quarter. Class II henges generally have their axes aligned approximately south-east to north-west or north-east to south-west.

It has been suggested that the stone and timber structures sometimes built inside henges were used as solar declinometers to measure the position of the rising or setting sun. These structures do not appear in all henges; and when they do, often they are considerably more recent than the henges. Thus, they are not necessarily connected with the henge&#x27;s original function. It has been conjectured that the henges would have been used to synchronize a calendar to the solar cycle for purposes of planting crops or timing religious rituals. Some henges have poles, stones or entrances that indicate the position of the rising or setting sun during the equinoxes and solstices, while others appear to frame certain constellations. Additionally, many are placed so that nearby hills either mark or do not interfere with such observations. Finally, some henges appear to be placed at particular latitudes. For example, a number are placed at a latitude of 55 degrees north, where the same two markers can indicate the rising and setting sun for both the spring and autumn equinoxes. But as henges are present from the extreme north to the extreme south of Britain, their latitude could not have been of great importance.

Formalisation is commonly attributed to henges: indications of the builders&#x27; concerns to control the arrival at, entrance into, and movement within the enclosures. This was achieved by placing flanking stones or avenues at the entrances of some henges, or by dividing the internal space with timber circles. While some henges were the first monuments to be built in their areas, others were added to already important landscapes, especially the larger examples.

The concentric nature of many of the internal features, such as the five rings of postholes at Balfarg or the six at Woodhenge, may represent a finer distinction than the inside-out differences suggested by henge earthworks. The ordering of space and the circular movement suggested by the sometimes densely packed internal features indicates a sophisticated degree of spatial understanding.

== Hengiform monument ==

Hengiform monuments, or mini henges, are distributed throughout England and mainland Scotland (with examples as far north as Caithness), though no examples have been found in Wales. Pits, cremations, postholes, stone-sockets, and graves have been found within them, and postholes and cremation pits have also been found to be present close to the site in some cases. They typically have either one entrance or two opposing entrances. In plan, a mini henge can be mistaken for a ploughed-out round barrow, although the former tend to be slightly larger and their earthworks more substantial. As with ordinary henges, they are thought to have served ritual purposes and are thought to be of late Neolithic date.

== Henge enclosure ==

Henge enclosures often contain or lie close to one or more ordinary henges. Finds of animal bone, grooved ware pottery, and evidence of dwellings have been found and coupled with the time and energy needed to build them, it is considered that they must have been important social centres analogous to tribal capitals. Two or four evenly spaced entrances lead through the earthwork to the centre.

== Modern henge monuments ==
A henge monument was restored at the Devil&#x27;s Quoits in Oxfordshire between 2002 and 2008.

In modern times a number of henge type monuments have been built, examples include:
*Maelmin henge (2000) 
*Arctic Henge Raufarhöfn, Iceland (1996)
*Achill-henge (2011), Ireland
*Sark Henge, Sark, Channel Islands (2015)

<text>The 55 Group were an internal body within the Scottish National Party (SNP) formed in 1955 (hence the name of the group).

This grouping started an organised campaign of internal dissent. This group was formed mainly of younger SNP members frustrated at the lack of electoral progress of the party in this period. There was also overt tones of anti-English sentiment amongst this grouping, epitomised by the publication of a leaflet &quot;The English: Are They Human?&quot;. This anti-English streak proved too much to bear for the SNP leadership and the 55 Group were expelled.

Some of their members went on to form a new political party, the Nationalist Party of Scotland (not to be confused with the earlier National Party of Scotland which merged with the Scottish Party in 1934 to form the SNP). This split in the SNP proved to be minor and involved only a few members, mainly located in the city of Edinburgh, and the new party made no impact whatsoever in the long-run.

The 55 Group are not the only organisation to have been proscribed by the SNP. In the early 1980s the 79 Group (like the 55 Group, named after the year they were formed, but unlike the 55 Group not an anti-English body, but a radical socialist organisation) and Siol nan Gaidheal were banned, and in more recent times they have banned their members from joining the Scottish Republican Socialist Movement.

<doc id="351581" wikidata="Q870895" url="?curid=351581" title="Health informatics">
<text>Health informatics combines communications, information technology (IT), and health care to enhance patient care and is at the forefront of the medical technological revolution. It can be viewed as a branch of engineering and applied science. 

The health domain provides an extremely wide variety of problems that can be tackled using computational techniques.

Health informatics is a spectrum of multidisciplinary fields that includes study of the design, development, and application of computational innovations to improve health care. The disciplines involved combine healthcare fields with computing fields, in particular computer engineering, software engineering, information engineering, bioinformatics, bio-inspired computing, theoretical computer science, information systems, data science, information technology, autonomic computing, and behavior informatics.

In the healthcare industry, health informatics has provided such technological solutions as telemedicine, surgical robots, electronic health records (EHR), Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), and decision support, artificial intelligence, and machine learning innovations including IBM&#x27;s Watson and Google&#x27;s DeepMind platform.

In academic institutions, health informatics includes research focuses on applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare and designing medical devices based on embedded systems. In some countries the term informatics is also used in the context of applying library science to data management in hospitals where it aims to develop methods and technologies for the acquisition, processing, and study of patient data, An umbrella term of biomedical informatics has been proposed.

== Subject areas ==
 Dutch former professor of medical informatics Jan van Bemmel has described medical informatics as the theoretical and practical aspects of information processing and communication based on knowledge and experience derived from processes in medicine and health care.

The Faculty of Clinical Informatics has identified six high level domains of core competency for clinical informaticians:
* Health and Wellbeing in Practice
* Information Technologies and Systems
* Working with Data and Analytical Methods
* Enabling Human and Organizational Change
* Decision Making
*Leading Informatics Teams and projects.

=== Tools to support practitioners ===
Clinical informaticians use their knowledge of patient care combined with their understanding of informatics concepts, methods, and health informatics tools to:
* Assess information and knowledge needs of health care professionals, patients and their families.
* Characterize, evaluate, and refine clinical processes,
* Develop, implement, and refine clinical decision support systems, and
* Lead or participate in the procurement, customization, development, implementation, management, evaluation, and continuous improvement of clinical information systems.
Clinicians collaborate with other health care and information technology professionals to develop health informatics tools which promote patient care that is safe, efficient, effective, timely, patient-centered, and equitable. Many clinical informaticists are also computer scientists.

===Telehealth and telemedicine===

Telehealth is the distribution of health-related services and information via electronic information and telecommunication technologies. It allows long-distance patient and clinician contact, care, advice, reminders, education, intervention, monitoring, and remote admissions. Telemedicine is sometimes used as a synonym, or is used in a more limited sense to describe remote clinical services, such as diagnosis and monitoring. Remote monitoring, also known as self-monitoring or testing, enables medical professionals to monitor a patient remotely using various technological devices. This method is primarily used for managing chronic diseases or specific conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or asthma.

These services can provide comparable health outcomes to traditional in-person patient encounters, supply greater satisfaction to patients, and may be cost-effective. Telerehabilitation (or e-rehabilitation[40][41]) is the delivery of rehabilitation services over telecommunications networks and the Internet. Most types of services fall into two categories: clinical assessment (the patient&#x27;s functional abilities in his or her environment), and clinical therapy. Some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are: neuropsychology, speech-language pathology, audiology, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a clinic because the patient has a disability or because of travel time. Telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance.

===Decision support, artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare===

A pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare was American biomedical informatician Edward H. Shortliffe. This field deals with utilization of machine-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence, to emulate human cognition in the analysis, interpretation, and comprehension of complicated medical and healthcare data. Specifically, AI is the ability of computer algorithms to approximate conclusions based solely on input data. AI programs are applied to practices such as diagnosis processes, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems.

As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions. Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of &quot;data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies&quot; which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry. The following are examples of large companies that have contributed to AI algorithms for use in healthcare:

* IBM&#x27;s Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic. IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson &amp; Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS), to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare.
* Microsoft&#x27;s Hanover project, in partnership with Oregon Health &amp; Science University&#x27;s Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells.
* Google&#x27;s DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues.
* Tencent is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS), an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork.
* Intel&#x27;s venture capital arm Intel Capital recently invested in startup Lumiata which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options.
* Kheiron Medical developed deep learning software to detect breast cancers in mammograms.
* Fractal Analytics has incubated Qure.ai which focuses on using deep learning and AI to improve radiology and speed up the analysis of diagnostic x-rays.
* Neuralink has come up with a next generation neuroprosthetic which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain. Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in place of a chunk of skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury.

Digital consultant apps like Babylon Health&#x27;s GP at Hand, Ada Health, Alibaba Health Doctor You, KareXpert and Your.MD use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user&#x27;s medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot &quot;Xiao Man&quot;, which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas.

It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (&quot;Cruzr&quot;) and Softbank Robotics (&quot;Pepper&quot;). The Indian startup Haptik recently developed a WhatsApp chatbot which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India. With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies. Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well. Companies such as BMW, GE, Tesla, Toyota, and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver&#x27;s vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances or in emotional distress. Examples of projects in computational health informatics include the COACH project.

===Clinical Research Informatics===

Clinical research informatics (CRI) is a sub-field of health informatics that tries to improve the efficiency of clinical research by using informatics methods. Some of the problems tackled by CRI are: creation of data warehouses of health care data that can be used for research, support of data collection in clinical trials by the use of electronic data capture systems, streamlining ethical approvals and renewals (in US the responsible entity is the local institutional review board), maintenance of repositories of past clinical trial data (de-identified). CRI is a fairly new branch of informatics and has met growing pains as any up and coming field does. Some issue CRI faces is the ability for the statisticians and the computer system architects to work with the clinical research staff in designing a system and lack of funding to support the development of a new system.

Researchers and the informatics team have a difficult time coordinating plans and ideas in order to design a system that is easy to use for the research team yet fits in the system requirements of the computer team. The lack of funding can be a hindrance to the development of the CRI. Many organizations who are performing research are struggling to get financial support to conduct the research, much less invest that money in an informatics system that will not provide them any more income or improve the outcome of the research (Embi, 2009). Ability to integrate data from multiple clinical trials is an important part of clinical research informatics. Initiatives, such as PhenX and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System triggered a general effort to improve secondary use of data collected in past human clinical trials. CDE initiatives, for example, try to allow clinical trial designers to adopt standardized research instruments (electronic case report forms).

A parallel effort to standardizing how data is collected are initiatives that offer de-identified patient level clinical study data to be downloaded by researchers who wish to re-use this data. Examples of such platforms are Project Data Sphere, dbGaP, ImmPort or Clinical Study Data Request. Informatics issues in data formats for sharing results (plain CSV files, FDA endorsed formats, such as CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model) are important challenges within the field of clinical research informatics. There are a number of activities within clinical research that CRI supports, including:
* More efficient and effective data collection and acquisition
* Improved recruitment into clinical trials
* Optimal protocol design and efficient management
* Patient recruitment and management
* Adverse event reporting
* Regulatory compliance
* Data storage, transfer, processing and analysis
* Repositories of data from completed clinical trials (for secondary analyses)
One of the fundamental elements of biomedical and translation research is the use of integrated data repositories. A survey conducted in 2010 defined &quot;integrated data repository&quot; (IDR) as a data warehouse incorporating various sources of clinical data to support queries for a range of research-like functions. Integrated data repositories are complex systems developed to solve a variety of problems ranging from identity management, protection of confidentiality, semantic and syntactic comparability of data from different sources, and most importantly convenient and flexible query.

Development of the field of clinical informatics led to the creation of large data sets with electronic health record data integrated with other data (such as genomic data). Types of data repositories include operational data stores (ODSs), clinical data warehouses (CDWs), clinical data marts, and clinical registries. Operational data stores established for extracting, transferring and loading before creating warehouse or data marts. Clinical registries repositories have long been in existence, but their contents are disease specific and sometimes considered archaic. Clinical data stores and clinical data warehouses are considered fast and reliable. Though these large integrated repositories have impacted clinical research significantly, it still faces challenges and barriers.

One big problem is the requirement for ethical approval by the institutional review board (IRB) for each research analysis meant for publication. Some research resources do not require IRB approval. For example, CDWs with data of deceased patients have been de-identified and IRB approval is not required for their usage. Another challenge is data quality. Methods that adjust for bias (such as using propensity score matching methods) assume that a complete health record is captured. Tools that examine data quality (e.g., point to missing data) help in discovering data quality problems.

===Translational bioinformatics===
Translational Bioinformatics (TBI) is a relatively new field that surfaced in the year of 2000 when human genome sequence was released. The commonly used definition of TBI is lengthy and could be found on the AMIA website. In simpler terms, TBI could be defined as a collection of colossal amounts of health related data (biomedical and genomic) and translation of the data into individually tailored clinical entities.
Today, TBI field is categorized into four major themes that are briefly described below:
* Clinical big data is a collection of electronic health records that are used for innovations. The evidence-based approach that is currently practiced in medicine is suggested to be merged with the practice-based medicine to achieve better outcomes for patients. As CEO of California-based cognitive computing firm Apixio, Darren Schutle, explains that the care can be better fitted to the patient if the data could be collected from various medical records, merged, and analyzed. Further, the combination of similar profiles can serve as a basis for personalized medicine pointing to what works and what does not for certain condition (Marr, 2016).
* Genomics in clinical careGenomic data are used to identify the genes involvement in unknown or rare conditions/syndromes. Currently, the most vigorous area of using genomics is oncology. The identification of genomic sequencing of cancer may define reasons of drug(s) sensitivity and resistance during oncological treatment processes.
* Omics for drugs discovery and repurposingRepurposing of the drug is an appealing idea that allows the pharmaceutical companies to sell an already approved drug to treat a different condition/disease that the drug was not initially approved for by the FDA. The observation of &quot;molecular signatures in disease and compare those to signatures observed in cells&quot; points to the possibility of a drug ability to cure and/or relieve symptoms of a disease.
* Personalized genomic testingIn the US, several companies offer direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing. The company that performs the majority of testing is called 23andMe. Utilizing genetic testing in health care raises many ethical, legal and social concerns; one of the main questions is whether the health care providers are ready to include patient-supplied genomic information while providing care that is unbiased (despite the intimate genomic knowledge) and a high quality. The documented examples of incorporating such information into a health care delivery showed both positive and negative impacts on the overall health care related outcomes.

===Medical signal processing===
An important application of information engineering in medicine is medical signal processing. It refers to the generation, analysis, and use of signals, which could take many forms such as image, sound, electrical, or biological.

===Medical image computing and imaging informatics===

Imaging informatics and medical image computing develops computational and mathematical methods for solving problems pertaining to medical images and their use for biomedical research and clinical care. Those fields aims to extract clinically relevant information or knowledge from medical images and computational analysis of the images. The methods can be grouped into several broad categories: image segmentation, image registration, image-based physiological modeling, and others.

===Medical robotics===
A medical robot is a robot used in the medical sciences. They include surgical robots. These are in most telemanipulators, which use the surgeon&#x27;s activators on one side to control the &quot;effector&quot; on the other side. There are the following types of medical robots:
* Surgical robots: either allow surgical operations to be carried out with better precision than an unaided human surgeon or allow remote surgery where a human surgeon is not physically present with the patient.
* Rehabilitation robots: facilitate and support the lives of infirm, elderly people, or those with dysfunction of body parts affecting movement. These robots are also used for rehabilitation and related procedures, such as training and therapy.
* Biorobots: a group of robots designed to imitate the cognition of humans and animals.
* Telepresence robots: allow off-site medical professionals to move, look around, communicate, and participate from remote locations.
* Pharmacy automation: robotic systems to dispense oral solids in a retail pharmacy setting or preparing sterile IV admixtures in a hospital pharmacy setting.
* Companion robot: has the capability to engage emotionally with users keeping them company and alerting if there is a problem with their health.
* Disinfection robot: has the capability to disinfect a whole room in mere minutes, generally using pulsed ultraviolet light. They are being used to fight Ebola virus disease.

===Pathology informatics===
Pathology informatics is a field that involves the use of information technology, computer systems, and data management to support and enhance the practice of pathology. It encompasses pathology laboratory operations, data analysis, and the interpretation of pathology-related information.

Key aspects of pathology informatics include:
*Laboratory information management systems (LIMS): Implementing and managing computer systems specifically designed for pathology departments. These systems help in tracking and managing patient specimens, results, and other pathology data.
*Digital pathology: Involves the use of digital technology to create, manage, and analyze pathology images. This includes side scanning and automated image analysis.
*Telepathology: Using technology to enable remote pathology consultation and collaboration. 
*Quality assurance and reporting: Implementing informatics solutions to ensure the quality and accuracy of pathology processes.

==International history==
Worldwide use of computer technology in medicine began in the early 1950s with the rise of the computers. In 1949, Gustav Wagner established the first professional organization for informatics in Germany. Specialized university departments and Informatics training programs began during the 1960s in France, Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands. Medical informatics research units began to appear during the 1970s in Poland and in the U.S. Since then the development of high-quality health informatics research, education and infrastructure has been a goal of the U.S. and the European Union.

Early names for health informatics included medical computing, biomedical computing, medical computer science, computer medicine, medical electronic data processing, medical automatic data processing, medical information processing, medical information science, medical software engineering, and medical computer technology.

The health informatics community is still growing, it is by no means a mature profession, but work in the UK by the voluntary registration body, the UK Council of Health Informatics Professions has suggested eight key constituencies within the domain–information management, knowledge management, portfolio/program/project management, ICT, education and research, clinical informatics, health records(service and business-related), health informatics service management. These constituencies accommodate professionals in and for the NHS, in academia and commercial service and solution providers.

Since the 1970s the most prominent international coordinating body has been the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA).

==== Argentina ====
The Argentinian health system is heterogeneous in its function, and because of that, the informatics developments show a heterogeneous stage. Many private health care centers have developed systems, such as the Hospital Aleman of Buenos Aires, or the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires that also has a residence program for health informatics.

==== Brazil ====

The first applications of computers to medicine and health care in Brazil started around 1968, with the installation of the first mainframes in public university hospitals, and the use of programmable calculators in scientific research applications. Minicomputers, such as the IBM 1130 were installed in several universities, and the first applications were developed for them, such as the hospital census in the School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto and patient master files, in the Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo, respectively at the cities of Ribeirão Preto and São Paulo campuses of the University of São Paulo.

In the 1970s, several Digital Corporation and Hewlett-Packard minicomputers were acquired for public and Armed Forces hospitals, and more intensively used for intensive-care unit, cardiology diagnostics, patient monitoring and other applications. In the early 1980s, with the arrival of cheaper microcomputers, a great upsurge of computer applications in health ensued, and in 1986 the Brazilian Society of Health Informatics was founded, the first Brazilian Congress of Health Informatics was held, and the first &quot;Brazilian Journal of Health Informatics&quot; was published. In Brazil, two universities are pioneers in teaching and research in medical informatics, both the University of São Paulo and the Federal University of São Paulo offer undergraduate programs highly qualified in the area as well as extensive graduate programs (MSc and PhD). In 2015 the Universidade Federal de Ciências da Saúde de Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, also started to offer undergraduate program.

==== Canada ====
Health Informatics projects in Canada are implemented provincially, with different provinces creating different systems. A national, federally funded, not-for-profit organisation called Canada Health Infoway was created in 2001 to foster the development and adoption of electronic health records across Canada. As of December 31, 2008, there were 276 EHR projects under way in Canadian hospitals, other health-care facilities, pharmacies and laboratories, with an investment value of $1.5-billion from Canada Health Infoway.

Provincial and territorial programmes include the following:
* eHealth Ontario was created as an Ontario provincial government agency in September 2008. It has been plagued by delays and its CEO was fired over a multimillion-dollar contracts scandal in 2009.
* Alberta Netcare was created in 2003 by the Government of Alberta. Today the netCARE portal is used daily by thousands of clinicians. It provides access to demographic data, prescribed/dispensed drugs, known allergies/intolerances, immunizations, laboratory test results, diagnostic imaging reports, the diabetes registry and other medical reports. netCARE interface capabilities are being included in electronic medical record products that are being funded by the provincial government.

==== United States ====
Even though the idea of using computers in medicine emerged as technology advanced in the early 20th century, it was not until the 1950s that informatics began to have an effect in the United States.

The earliest use of electronic digital computers for medicine was for dental projects in the 1950s at the United States National Bureau of Standards by Robert Ledley. During the mid-1950s, the United States Air Force (USAF) carried out several medical projects on its computers while also encouraging civilian agencies such as the National Academy of Sciences – National Research Council (NAS-NRC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to sponsor such work. In 1959, Ledley and Lee B. Lusted published &quot;Reasoning Foundations of Medical Diagnosis,&quot; a widely read article in &quot;Science&quot;, which introduced computing (especially operations research) techniques to medical workers. Ledley and Lusted&#x27;s article has remained influential for decades, especially within the field of medical decision making.

Guided by Ledley&#x27;s late 1950s survey of computer use in biology and medicine (carried out for the NAS-NRC), and by his and Lusted&#x27;s articles, the NIH undertook the first major effort to introduce computers to biology and medicine. This effort, carried out initially by the NIH&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Computers in Research (ACCR), chaired by Lusted, spent over $40 million between 1960 and 1964 in order to establish dozens of large and small biomedical research centers in the US.

One early (1960, non-ACCR) use of computers was to help quantify normal human movement, as a precursor to scientifically measuring deviations from normal, and design of prostheses. The use of computers (IBM 650, 1620, and 7040) allowed analysis of a large sample size, and of more measurements and subgroups than had been previously practical with mechanical calculators, thus allowing an objective understanding of how human locomotion varies by age and body characteristics. A study co-author was Dean of the Marquette University College of Engineering; this work led to discrete Biomedical Engineering departments there and elsewhere.

The next steps, in the mid-1960s, were the development (sponsored largely by the NIH) of expert systems such as MYCIN and Internist-I. In 1965, the National Library of Medicine started to use MEDLINE and MEDLARS. Around this time, Neil Pappalardo, Curtis Marble, and Robert Greenes developed MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System) in Octo Barnett&#x27;s Laboratory of Computer Science at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, another center of biomedical computing that received significant support from the NIH. In the 1970s and 1980s it was the most commonly used programming language for clinical applications. The MUMPS operating system was used to support MUMPS language specifications. , a descendant of this system is being used in the United States Veterans Affairs hospital system. The VA has the largest enterprise-wide health information system that includes an electronic medical record, known as the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). A graphical user interface known as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) allows health care providers to review and update a patient&#x27;s electronic medical record at any of the VA&#x27;s over 1,000 health care facilities.

During the 1960s, Morris F. Collen, a physician working for Kaiser Permanente&#x27;s Division of Research, developed computerized systems to automate many aspects of multi-phased health checkups. These systems became the basis the larger medical databases Kaiser Permanente developed during the 1970s and 1980s. The American Medical Informatics Association presents the Morris F. Collen Award of Excellence for an individual&#x27;s lifetime achievement in biomedical informatics.

In the 1970s a growing number of commercial vendors began to market practice management and electronic medical records systems. Although many products exist, only a small number of health practitioners use fully featured electronic health care records systems. In 1970, Warner V. Slack, MD, and Howard Bleich, MD, co-founded the academic division of clinical informatics (DCI) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. Warner Slack is a pioneer of the development of the electronic patient medical history, and in 1977 Dr. Bleich created the first user-friendly search engine for the worlds biomedical literature.

Computerised systems involved in patient care have led to a number of changes. Such changes have led to improvements in electronic health records which are now capable of sharing medical information among multiple health care stakeholders (Zahabi, Kaber, &amp; Swangnetr, 2015); thereby, supporting the flow of patient information through various modalities of care. One opportunity for electronic health records (EHR) to be even more effectively used is to utilize natural language processing for searching and analyzing notes and text that would otherwise be inaccessible for review. These can be further developed through ongoing collaboration between software developers and end-users of natural language processing tools within the electronic health EHRs.

Computer use today involves a broad ability which includes but is not limited to physician diagnosis and documentation, patient appointment scheduling, and billing. Many researchers in the field have identified an increase in the quality of health care systems, decreased errors by health care workers, and lastly savings in time and money (Zahabi, Kaber, &amp; Swangnetr, 2015). The system, however, is not perfect and will continue to require improvement. Frequently cited factors of concern involve usability, safety, accessibility, and user-friendliness (Zahabi, Kaber, &amp; Swangnetr, 2015).

Homer R. Warner, one of the fathers of medical informatics, founded the Department of Medical Informatics at the University of Utah in 1968. The American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) has an award named after him on application of informatics to medicine.

The American Medical Informatics Association created a, board certification for medical informatics from the American Board of Preventive Medicine. The American Nurses Credentialing Center offers a board certification in Nursing Informatics. For Radiology Informatics, the CIIP (Certified Imaging Informatics Professional) certification was created by ABII (The American Board of Imaging Informatics) which was founded by SIIM (the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine) and ARRT (the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists) in 2005. The CIIP certification requires documented experience working in Imaging Informatics, formal testing and is a limited time credential requiring renewal every five years.

The exam tests for a combination of IT technical knowledge, clinical understanding, and project management experience thought to represent the typical workload of a PACS administrator or other radiology IT clinical support role. Certifications from PARCA (PACS Administrators Registry and Certifications Association) are also recognized. The five PARCA certifications are tiered from entry-level to architect level. The American Health Information Management Association offers credentials in medical coding, analytics, and data administration, such as Registered Health Information Administrator and Certified Coding Associate. Certifications are widely requested by employers in health informatics, and overall the demand for certified informatics workers in the United States is outstripping supply. The American Health Information Management Association reports that only 68% of applicants pass certification exams on the first try.

In 2017, a consortium of health informatics trainers (composed of MEASURE Evaluation, Public Health Foundation India, University of Pretoria, Kenyatta University, and the University of Ghana) identified the following areas of knowledge as a curriculum for the digital health workforce, especially in low- and middle-income countries: clinical decision support; telehealth; privacy, security, and confidentiality; workflow process improvement; technology, people, and processes; process engineering; quality process improvement and health information technology; computer hardware; software; databases; data warehousing; information networks; information systems; information exchange; data analytics; and usability methods.

In 2004, President George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13335, creating the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) as a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The mission of this office is widespread adoption of interoperable electronic health records (EHRs) in the US within 10 years. See quality improvement organizations for more information on federal initiatives in this area. In 2014 the Department of Education approved an advanced Health Informatics Undergraduate program that was submitted by the University of South Alabama. The program is designed to provide specific Health Informatics education, and is the only program in the country with a Health Informatics Lab. The program is housed in the School of Computing in Shelby Hall, a recently completed $50 million state of the art teaching facility. The University of South Alabama awarded David L. Loeser on May 10, 2014, with the first Health Informatics degree.

The program currently is scheduled to have 100+ students awarded by 2016. The Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT), a private nonprofit group, was funded in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop a set of standards for electronic health records (EHR) and supporting networks, and certify vendors who meet them. In July 2006, CCHIT released its first list of 22 certified ambulatory EHR products, in two different announcements. Harvard Medical School added a department of biomedical informatics in 2015. The University of Cincinnati in partnership with Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital Medical Center created a biomedical informatics (BMI) Graduate certificate program and in 2015 began a BMI PhD program. The joint program allows for researchers and students to observe the impact their work has on patient care directly as discoveries are translated from bench to bedside. 

===Europe===
==== European Union ====
The European Commission&#x27;s preference, as exemplified in the 5th Framework as well as currently pursued pilot projects, is for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) for health care.

The European Union&#x27;s Member States are committed to sharing their best practices and experiences to create a European eHealth Area, thereby improving access to and quality health care at the same time as stimulating growth in a promising new industrial sector. The European eHealth Action Plan plays a fundamental role in the European Union&#x27;s strategy. Work on this initiative involves a collaborative approach among several parts of the Commission services. The European Institute for Health Records is involved in the promotion of high quality electronic health record systems in the European Union.

==== UK ====
The broad history of health informatics has been captured in the book &quot;UK Health Computing: Recollections and reflections&quot;, Hayes G, Barnett D (Eds.), BCS (May 2008) by those active in the field, predominantly members of BCS Health and its constituent groups. The book describes the path taken as &quot;early development of health informatics was unorganized and idiosyncratic&quot;. In the early 1950s, it was prompted by those involved in NHS finance and only in the early 1960s did solutions including those in pathology (1960), radiotherapy (1962), immunization (1963), and primary care (1968) emerge. Many of these solutions, even in the early 1970s were developed in-house by pioneers in the field to meet their own requirements. In part, this was due to some areas of health services (for example the immunization and vaccination of children) still being provided by Local Authorities.

The coalition government has proposed broadly to return to the 2010 strategy Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS (July 2010); stating: &quot;We will put patients at the heart of the NHS, through an information revolution and greater choice and control&#x27; with shared decision-making becoming the norm: &quot;no decision about me without me&#x27; and patients having access to the information they want, to make choices about their care. They will have increased control over their own care records.&quot;

There are different models of health informatics delivery in each of the home countries (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales) but some bodies like UKCHIP (see below) operate for those &#x27;in and for&#x27; all the home countries and beyond.

NHS informatics in England was contracted out to several vendors for national health informatics solutions under the National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT) label in the early to mid-2000s, under the auspices of NHS Connecting for Health (part of the Health and Social Care Information Centre as of 1 April 2013). NPfIT originally divided the country into five regions, with strategic &#x27;systems integration&#x27; contracts awarded to one of several Local Service Providers (LSP).

The various specific technical solutions were required to connect securely with the NHS &#x27;Spine&#x27;, a system designed to broker data between different systems and care settings. NPfIT fell significantly behind schedule and its scope and design were being revised in real time, exacerbated by media and political lambasting of the Programme&#x27;s spend (past and projected) against the proposed budget. In 2010 a consultation was launched as part of the new Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition Government&#x27;s White Paper &quot;Liberating the NHS&quot;. This initiative provided little in the way of innovative thinking, primarily re-stating existing strategies within the proposed new context of the Coalition&#x27;s vision for the NHS.
The degree of computerization in NHS secondary care was quite high before NPfIT, and the programme stagnated further development of the install base – the original NPfIT regional approach provided neither a single, nationwide solution nor local health community agility or autonomy to purchase systems, but instead tried to deal with a hinterland in the middle.

Almost all general practices in England and Wales are computerized under the GP Systems of Choice programme, and patients have relatively extensive computerized primary care clinical records. System choice is the responsibility of individual general practices and while there is no single, standardized GP system, it sets relatively rigid minimum standards of performance and functionality for vendors to adhere to. Interoperation between primary and secondary care systems is rather primitive. It is hoped that a focus on interworking (for interfacing and integration) standards will stimulate synergy between primary and secondary care in sharing necessary information to support the care of individuals. Notable successes to date are in the electronic requesting and viewing of test results, and in some areas, GPs have access to digital x-ray images from secondary care systems.

In 2019 the GP Systems of Choice framework was replaced by the GP IT Futures framework, which is to be the main vehicle used by clinical commissioning groups to buy services for GPs. This is intended to increase competition in an area that is dominated by EMIS and TPP. 69 technology companies offering more than 300 solutions have been accepted on to the new framework.

Wales has a dedicated Health Informatics function that supports NHS Wales in leading on the new integrated digital information services and promoting Health Informatics as a career.

The British Computer Society (BCS) provides 4 different professional registration levels for Health and Care Informatics Professionals: Practitioner, Senior Practitioner, Advanced Practitioner, and Leading Practitioner. The Faculty of Clinical Informatics (FCI) is the professional membership society for health and social care professionals in clinical informatics offering Fellowship, Membership and Associateship. BCS and FCI are member organizations of the Federation for Informatics Professionals in Health and Social Care (FedIP), a collaboration between the leading professional bodies in health and care informatics supporting the development of the informatics professions.

The Faculty of Clinical Informatics has produced a Core Competency Framework that describes the wide range of skills needed by practitioners.

==== Netherlands ====
In the Netherlands, health informatics is currently a priority for research and implementation. The Netherlands Federation of University medical centers (NFU) has created the &quot;Citrienfonds&quot;, which includes the programs eHealth and Registration at the Source. The Netherlands also has the national organizations Society for Healthcare Informatics (VMBI) and Nictiz, the national center for standardization and eHealth.

===Asia and Oceania===
In Asia and Australia-New Zealand, the regional group called the Asia Pacific Association for Medical Informatics (APAMI) was established in 1994 and now consists of more than 15 member regions in the Asia Pacific Region.

==== Australia ====
The Australasian College of Health Informatics (ACHI) is the professional association for health informatics in the Asia-Pacific region. It represents the interests of a broad range of clinical and non-clinical professionals working within the health informatics sphere through a commitment to quality, standards and ethical practice. ACHI is an academic institutional member of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and a full member of the Australian Council of Professions.
ACHI is a sponsor of the &quot;e-Journal for Health Informatics&quot;, an indexed and peer-reviewed professional journal. ACHI has also supported the &quot;Australian Health Informatics Education Council&quot; (AHIEC) since its founding in 2009.

Although there are a number of health informatics organizations in Australia, the Health Informatics Society of Australia (HISA) is regarded as the major umbrella group and is a member of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). Nursing informaticians were the driving force behind the formation of HISA, which is now a company limited by guarantee of the members. The membership comes from across the informatics spectrum that is from students to corporate affiliates. HISA has a number of branches (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia) as well as special interest groups such as nursing (NIA), pathology, aged and community care, industry and medical imaging (Conrick, 2006).

==== China ====
After 20 years, China performed a successful transition from its planned economy to a socialist market economy. Along this change, China&#x27;s health care system also experienced a significant reform to follow and adapt to this historical revolution. In 2003, the data (released from Ministry of Health of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (MoH)), indicated that the national health care-involved expenditure was up to RMB 662.33 billion totally, which accounted for about 5.56% of nationwide gross domestic products. Before the 1980s, the entire health care costs were covered in central government annual budget. Since that, the construct of health care-expended supporters started to change gradually. Most of the expenditure was contributed by health insurance schemes and private spending, which corresponded to 40% and 45% of total expenditure, respectively. Meanwhile, the financially governmental contribution was decreased to 10% only. On the other hand, by 2004, up to 296,492 health care facilities were recorded in statistic summary of MoH, and an average of 2.4 clinical beds per 1000 people were mentioned as well.
Along with the development of information technology since the 1990s, health care providers realized that the information could generate significant benefits to improve their services by computerized cases and data, for instance of gaining the information for directing patient care and assessing the best patient care for specific clinical conditions. Therefore, substantial resources were collected to build China&#x27;s own health informatics system.

Most of these resources were arranged to construct hospital information system (HIS), which was aimed to minimize unnecessary waste and repetition, subsequently to promote the efficiency and quality-control of health care. By 2004, China had successfully spread HIS through approximately 35–40% of nationwide hospitals. However, the dispersion of hospital-owned HIS varies critically. In the east part of China, over 80% of hospitals constructed HIS, in northwest of China the equivalent was no more than 20%. Moreover, all of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) above rural level, approximately 80% of health care organisations above the rural level and 27% of hospitals over town level have the ability to perform the transmission of reports about real-time epidemic situation through public health information system and to analysis infectious diseases by dynamic statistics.

China has four tiers in its health care system. The first tier is street health and workplace clinics and these are cheaper than hospitals in terms of medical billing and act as prevention centers. The second tier is district and enterprise hospitals along with specialist clinics and these provide the second level of care. The third tier is provisional and municipal general hospitals and teaching hospitals which provided the third level of care. In a tier of its own is the national hospitals which are governed by the Ministry of Health. China has been greatly improving its health informatics since it finally opened its doors to the outside world and joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 2001, it was reported that China had 324,380 medical institutions and the majority of those were clinics. The reason for that is that clinics are prevention centers and Chinese people like using traditional Chinese medicine as opposed to Western medicine and it usually works for the minor cases. China has also been improving its higher education in regards to health informatics.

At the end of 2002, there were 77 medical universities and medical colleges. There were 48 university medical colleges which offered bachelor, master, and doctorate degrees in medicine. There were 21 higher medical specialty institutions that offered diploma degrees so in total, there were 147 higher medical and educational institutions. Since joining the WTO, China has been working hard to improve its education system and bring it up to international standards.
SARS played a large role in China quickly improving its health care system. Back in 2003, there was an outbreak of SARS and that made China hurry to spread HIS or Hospital Information System and more than 80% of hospitals had HIS. China had been comparing itself to Korea&#x27;s health care system and figuring out how it can better its own system. There was a study done that surveyed six hospitals in China that had HIS. The results were that doctors did not use computers as much so it was concluded that it was not used as much for clinical practice than it was for administrative purposes. The survey asked if the hospitals created any websites and it was concluded that only four of them had created websites and that three had a third-party company create it for them and one was created by the hospital staff. In conclusion, all of them agreed or strongly agreed that providing health information on the Internet should be utilized.

Collected information at different times, by different participants or systems could frequently lead to issues of misunderstanding, dis-comparing or dis-exchanging. To design an issues-minor system, health care providers realized that certain standards were the basis for sharing information and interoperability, however a system lacking standards would be a large impediment to interfere the improvement of corresponding information systems. Given that the standardization for health informatics depends on the authorities, standardization events must be involved with government and the subsequently relevant funding and supports were critical. In 2003, the Ministry of Health released the Development Lay-out of National Health Informatics (2003–2010) indicating the identification of standardization for health informatics which is &#x27;combining adoption of international standards and development of national standards&#x27;.

In China, the establishment of standardization was initially facilitated with the development of vocabulary, classification and coding, which is conducive to reserve and transmit information for premium management at national level. By 2006, 55 international/ domestic standards of vocabulary, classification and coding have served in hospital information system. In 2003, the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and the ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) were adopted as standards for diagnostic classification and acute care procedure classification. Simultaneously, the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) were translated and tested in China &#x27;s local applied environment.
Another coding standard, named Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), was applied to serve as general identifiers for clinical observation in hospitals.

Personal identifier codes were widely employed in different information systems, involving name, sex, nationality, family relationship, educational level and job occupation. However, these codes within different systems are inconsistent, when sharing between different regions. Considering this large quantity of vocabulary, classification and coding standards between different jurisdictions, the health care provider realized that using multiple systems could generate issues of resource wasting and a non-conflicting national level standard was beneficial and necessary. Therefore, in late 2003, the health informatics group in Ministry of Health released three projects to deal with issues of lacking national health information standards, which were the Chinese National Health Information Framework and Standardization, the Basic Data Set Standards of Hospital Information System and the Basic Data Set Standards of Public Health Information System.

The objectives of the Chinese National Health Information Framework and Standardization project were:
# Establish national health information framework and identify in what areas standards and guidelines are required
# Identify the classes, relationships and attributes of national health information framework. Produce a conceptual health data model to cover the scope of the health information framework
# Create logical data model for specific domains, depicting the logical data entities, the data attributes, and the relationships between the entities according to the conceptual health data model
# Establish uniform represent standard for data elements according to the data entities and their attributes in conceptual data model and logical data model
# Circulate the completed health information framework and health data model to the partnership members for review and acceptance
# Develop a process to maintain and refine the China model and to align with and influence international health data models

===== Comparing China&#x27;s EHR Standard and ASTM E1384 =====
In 2011, researchers from local universities evaluated the performance of China&#x27;s Electronic Health Record (EHR) Standard compared with the American Society for Testing and Materials Standard Practice for Content and Structure of Electronic Health Records in the United States (ASTM E1384 Standard, withdrawn in 2017). The deficiencies that were found are listed in the following.
# The lack of supporting on privacy and security. The ISO/TS 18308 specifies &quot;The EHR must support the ethical and legal use of personal information, in accordance with established privacy principles and frameworks, which may be culturally or jurisdictionally specific&quot; (ISO 18308: Health Informatics-Requirements for an Electronic Health Record Architecture, 2004). However this China&#x27;s EHR Standard did not achieve any of the fifteen requirements in the subclass of privacy and security.
# The shortage of supporting on different types of data and reference. Considering only ICD-9 is referenced as China&#x27;s external international coding systems, other similar systems, such as SNOMED CT in clinical terminology presentation, cannot be considered as familiar for Chinese specialists, which could lead to internationally information-sharing deficiency.
# The lack of more generic and extensible lower level data structures. China&#x27;s large and complex EHR Standard was constructed for all medical domains. However, the specific and time-frequent attributes of clinical data elements, value sets and templates identified that this once-for-all purpose cannot lead to practical consequence.

In Hong Kong, a computerized patient record system called the Clinical Management System (CMS) has been developed by the Hospital Authority since 1994. This system has been deployed at all the sites of the authority (40 hospitals and 120 clinics). It is used for up to 2 million transactions daily by 30,000 clinical staff. The comprehensive records of 7 million patients are available on-line in the electronic patient record (ePR), with data integrated from all sites. Since 2004 radiology image viewing has been added to the ePR, with radiography images from any HA site being available as part of the ePR.

The Hong Kong Hospital Authority placed particular attention to the governance of clinical systems development, with input from hundreds of clinicians being incorporated through a structured process. The health informatics section in the Hospital Authority has a close relationship with the information technology department and clinicians to develop health care systems for the organization to support the service to all public hospitals and clinics in the region.

The Hong Kong Society of Medical Informatics (HKSMI) was established in 1987 to promote the use of information technology in health care. The eHealth Consortium has been formed to bring together clinicians from both the private and public sectors, medical informatics professionals and the IT industry to further promote IT in health care in Hong Kong.

==== India ====

* eHCF School of Medical Informatics
* eHealth-Care Foundation

==== Malaysia ====
Since 2010, the Ministry of Health (MoH) has been working on the Malaysian Health Data Warehouse (MyHDW) project. MyHDW aims to meet the diverse needs of timely health information provision and management, and acts as a platform for the standardization and integration of health data from a variety of sources (Health Informatics Centre, 2013). The Ministry of Health has embarked on introducing the electronic Hospital Information Systems (HIS) in several public hospitals including Putrajaya Hospital, Serdang Hospital and Selayang Hospital. Similarly, under Ministry of Higher Education, hospitals such as University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) and University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) are also using HIS for healthcare delivery.

A hospital information system (HIS) is a comprehensive, integrated information system designed to manage the administrative, financial and clinical aspects of a hospital. As an area of medical informatics, the aim of hospital information system is to achieve the best possible support of patient care and administration by electronic data processing. HIS plays a vital role in planning, initiating, organizing and controlling the operations of the subsystems of the hospital and thus provides a synergistic organization in the process.

==== New Zealand ====
Health informatics is taught at five New Zealand universities. The most mature and established programme has been offered for over a decade at Otago. Health Informatics New Zealand (HINZ), is the national organization that advocates for health informatics. HINZ organizes a conference every year and also publishes a journal, &quot;Healthcare Informatics Review Online&quot;.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
The Saudi Association for Health Information (SAHI) was established in 2006 to work under direct supervision of King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences to practice public activities, develop theoretical and applicable knowledge, and provide scientific and applicable studies.

=== Russia ===
The Russian health care system is based on the principles of the Soviet health care system, which was oriented on mass prophylaxis, prevention of infection and epidemic diseases, vaccination and immunization of the population on a socially protected basis. The current government health care system consists of several directions:
* Preventive health care
* Primary health care
* Specialized medical care
* Obstetrical and gynecologic medical care
* Pediatric medical care
* Surgery
* Rehabilitation/ Health resort treatment
One of the main issues of the post-Soviet medical health care system was the absence of the united system providing optimization of work for medical institutes with one, single database and structured appointment schedule and hence hours-long lines. Efficiency of medical workers might have been also doubtful because of the paperwork administrating or lost book records.

Along with the development of the information systems IT and health care departments in Moscow agreed on design of a system that would improve public services of health care institutes. Tackling the issues appearing in the existing system, the Moscow Government ordered that the design of a system would provide simplified electronic booking to public clinics and automate the work of medical workers on the first level.

The system designed for that purposes was called EMIAS (United Medical Information and Analysis System) and presents an electronic health record (EHR) with the majority of other services set in the system that manages the flow of patients, contains outpatient card integrated in the system, and provides an opportunity to manage consolidated managerial accounting and personalized list of medical help. Besides that, the system contains information about availability of the medical institutions and various doctors.

The implementation of the system started in 2013 with the organization of one computerized database for all patients in the city, including a front-end for the users. EMIAS was implemented in Moscow and the region and it is planned that the project should extend to most parts of the country.

==Law==

&quot;Health informatics law&quot; deals with evolving and sometimes complex legal principles as they apply to information technology in health-related fields. It addresses the privacy, ethical and operational issues that invariably arise when electronic tools, information and media are used in health care delivery. Health Informatics Law also applies to all matters that involve information technology, health care and the interaction of information. It deals with the circumstances under which data and records are shared with other fields or areas that support and enhance patient care.

As many health care systems are making an effort to have patient records more readily available to them via the internet, it is important that providers implement security standards in order to ensure that the patients&#x27; information is safe. They have to be able to assure confidentiality, integrity, and security of the people, process, and technology. Since there is also the possibility of payments being made through this system, it is vital that this aspect of their private information will also be protected through cryptography.

The use of technology in health care settings has become popular and this trend is expected to continue. Various health care facilities had instigated different kinds of health information technology systems in the provision of patient care, such as electronic health records (EHRs), computerized charting, etc. The growing popularity of health information technology systems and the escalation in the amount of health information that can be exchanged and transferred electronically increased the risk of potential infringement in patients&#x27; privacy and confidentiality. This concern triggered the establishment of strict measures by both policymakers and individual facility to ensure patient privacy and confidentiality.

One of the federal laws enacted to safeguard patient&#x27;s health information (medical record, billing information, treatment plan, etc.) and to guarantee patient&#x27;s privacy is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or HIPAA. HIPAA gives patients the autonomy and control over their own health records. Furthermore, according to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (n.d.), this law enables patients to:
* View their own health records
* Request a copy of their own medical records
* Request correction to any incorrect health information
* Know who has access to their health record
* Request who can and cannot view/access their health information

== Health and medical informatics journals ==


&quot;Computers and Biomedical Research&quot;, published in 1967, was one of the first dedicated journals to health informatics. Other early journals included &quot;Computers and Medicine&quot;, published by the American Medical Association; &quot;Journal of Clinical Computing&quot;, published by Gallagher Printing; &quot;Journal of Medical Systems&quot;, published by Plenum Press; and &quot;MD Computing&quot;, published by Springer-Verlag. In 1984, Lippincott published the first nursing-specific journal, titled &quot;Journal Computers in Nursing&quot;, which is now known as &quot;Computers Informatics Nursing&quot; (&quot;CIN&quot;).

As of September 7, 2016, there are roughly 235 informatics journals listed in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) catalog of journals. The &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot; for 2018 gives the top three journals in medical informatics as the &quot;Journal of Medical Internet Research&quot; (impact factor of 4.945), &quot;JMIR mHealth and uHealth&quot; (4.301) and the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association&quot; (4.292).

==Competencies, education and certification==
In the United States, &quot;clinical informatics&quot; is a subspecialty within several medical specialties. For example, in pathology, the American Board of Pathology offers clinical informatics certification for pathologists who have completed 24 months of related training, and the American Board of Preventive Medicine offers clinical informatics certification within preventive medicine.

In October 2011 American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), the organization overseeing the certification of specialist MDs in the United States, announced the creation of MD-only physician certification in clinical informatics. The first examination for board certification in the subspecialty of clinical informatics was offered in October 2013 by American Board of Preventive Medicine (ABPM) with 432 passing to become the 2014 inaugural class of Diplomates in clinical informatics. Fellowship programs exist for physicians who wish to become board-certified in clinical informatics. Physicians must have graduated from a medical school in the United States or Canada, or a school located elsewhere that is approved by the ABPM. In addition, they must complete a primary residency program such as Internal Medicine (or any of the 24 subspecialties recognized by the ABMS) and be eligible to become licensed to practice medicine in the state where their fellowship program is located. The fellowship program is 24 months in length, with fellows dividing their time between Informatics rotations, didactic method, research, and clinical work in their primary specialty.

<text>Liquid helium is a physical state of helium at very low temperatures at standard atmospheric pressures. Liquid helium may show superfluidity.

At standard pressure, the chemical element helium exists in a liquid form only at the extremely low temperature of . Its boiling point and critical point depend on the isotope of helium present: the common isotope helium-4 or the rare isotope helium-3. These are the only two stable isotopes of helium. See the table below for the values of these physical quantities. The density of liquid helium-4 at its boiling point and a pressure of one atmosphere (101.3 kilopascals) is about , or about one-eighth the density of liquid water.

==Liquefaction==
Helium was first liquefied on July 10, 1908, by the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. At that time, helium-3 was unknown because the mass spectrometer had not yet been invented. In more recent decades, liquid helium has been used as a cryogenic refrigerant (which is used in cryocoolers), and liquid helium is produced commercially for use in superconducting magnets such as those used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and experiments in physics, such as low temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy. The Large Hadron Collider contains superconducting magnets that are cooled with 120 tonnes of liquid helium.

===Liquified helium-3===

A helium-3 atom is a fermion and at very low temperatures, they form two-atom Cooper pairs which are bosonic and condense into a superfluid. These Cooper pairs are substantially larger than the interatomic separation.

==Characteristics==

The temperature required to produce liquid helium is low because of the weakness of the attractions between the helium atoms. These interatomic forces in helium are weak to begin with because helium is a noble gas, but the interatomic attractions are reduced even more by the effects of quantum mechanics. These are significant in helium because of its low atomic mass of about four atomic mass units. The zero point energy of liquid helium is less if its atoms are less confined by their neighbors. Hence in liquid helium, its ground state energy can decrease by a naturally occurring increase in its average interatomic distance. However at greater distances, the effects of the interatomic forces in helium are even weaker.

Because of the very weak interatomic forces in helium, the element remains a liquid at atmospheric pressure all the way from its liquefaction point down to absolute zero. At temperatures below their liquefaction points, both helium-4 and helium-3 undergo transitions to superfluids. (See the table below.) Liquid helium can be solidified only under very low temperatures and high pressures.

Liquid helium-4 and the rare helium-3 are not completely miscible. Below 0.9 kelvin at their saturated vapor pressure, a mixture of the two isotopes undergoes a phase separation into a normal fluid (mostly helium-3) that floats on a denser superfluid consisting mostly of helium-4. This phase separation happens because the overall mass of liquid helium can reduce its thermodynamic enthalpy by separating.

At extremely low temperatures, the superfluid phase, rich in helium-4, can contain up to 6% helium-3 in solution. This makes the small-scale use of the dilution refrigerator possible, which is capable of reaching temperatures of a few millikelvins.

Superfluid helium-4 has substantially different properties from ordinary liquid helium.

==History==
In 1908, Kamerlingh-Onnes succeeded in liquifying a small quantity of helium. In 1923, he provided advice to the Canadian physicist John Cunningham McLennan, who was the first to produce quantities of liquid helium almost on demand.
Important early work on the characteristics of liquid helium was done by the Soviet physicist Lev Landau, later extended by the American physicist Richard Feynman.

In 1961, Vignos and Fairbank reported the existence of a different phase of solid helium-4, designated the gamma-phase. It exists for a narrow range of pressure between 1.45 and 1.78 K.
