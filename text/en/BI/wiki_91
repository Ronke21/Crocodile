<text>Kateri Tekakwitha ( in Mohawk), given the name Tekakwitha, baptized as Catherine (&quot;Kateri&quot; in Mohawk), and informally known as Lily of the Mohawks (1656 – April 17, 1680), is a Mohawk/Algonquin Catholic saint and virgin. Born in the Mohawk village of Ossernenon, in present-day New York, she contracted smallpox in an epidemic; her family died and her face was scarred. She converted to Catholicism at age 19. She took a vow of perpetual virginity, left her village, and moved for the remaining five years of her life to the Jesuit mission village of Kahnawake, just south of Montreal. She was beatified in 1980 by Pope John Paul II and canonized by Pope Benedict XVI at Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica on 21 October 2012.

==Early life and education==

&quot;Tekakwitha&quot; is the given name she received by her Mohawk people. It translates to &quot;She who bumps into things.&quot; She was born around 1656 in the Mohawk village of Ossernenon in northeastern New York state.

She was the daughter of Kenneronkwa, a Mohawk chief, and Kahenta, an Algonquin woman, who had been captured in a raid and then adopted and assimilated into the tribe. Kahenta had been baptized Catholic and educated by French missionaries in Trois-Rivières, east of Montreal. Mohawk warriors captured her and took her to their homeland. Kahenta eventually married Kenneronkwa. Tekakwitha was the first of their two children. A brother followed.

Tekakwitha&#x27;s original village was highly diverse. The Mohawk were absorbing many captured Native people from other tribes, particularly their competitors, the Huron, to replace people who died from warfare or diseases.

When Tekakwitha was around four years old, her baby brother and both of her parents died of smallpox. Tekakwitha survived, but suffered from facial scars and impaired eyesight. Due to her scars, she wore head covering and cloths to cover them. She was soon adopted and went to live with her father&#x27;s sister and her husband, a chief of the Turtle Clan.

At age 11, Tekakwitha was visited by three members of the Society of Jesus. Tekakwitha was greatly impressed by these Jesuits, who were likely the first white Christians she had encountered in her life. Tekakwitha began to lead a life, led by the teachings of the three Jesuits. She was staying with her anti-Christian uncle at the time, and many other people from her tribe opposed her conversion. 

The Jesuits&#x27; account of Tekakwitha said that she was a modest girl who avoided social gatherings and covered her head because of the scars. She became skilled at traditional women&#x27;s arts like making clothing, weaving mats, and preparing food. As was the custom, she was pressured to think about marriage around age thirteen, but she refused. When speaking to her confessor, she stated, &quot;I can have no spouse but Jesus.&quot; She followed by proclaiming, &quot;I have the strongest aversion to marriage.&quot;

==Upheaval and invasions==
Tekakwitha grew up in a period of upheaval, as the Mohawk interacted with French and Dutch colonists, who were competing in the lucrative fur trade. Trying to make inroads in Iroquois territory, the French attacked the Mohawk in present-day central New York in 1666. After driving the people from their homes, the French burned the three Mohawk villages. Tekakwitha, around ten years old, fled with her new family.

After the defeat by the French forces, the Mohawk accepted a peace treaty that required them to tolerate Jesuit missionaries in their villages. The Jesuits established a mission near Auriesville, New York. They spoke of Christianity in terms with which the Mohawk could identify.

The Mohawk crossed their river to rebuild Caughnawaga on the north bank, west of the present-day town of Fonda, New York. In 1667, when Tekakwitha was 11 years old, she met the Jesuit missionaries Jacques Frémin, Jacques Bruyas, and Jean Pierron, who had come to the village. Her uncle opposed any contact with them because he did not want her to convert to Christianity. One of his older daughters had already become Catholic.

In the summer of 1669, several hundred Mohican warriors, advancing from the east, launched an attack on Caughnawaga. Tekakwitha, at that point around 13 years old, joined other girls to help priest Jean Pierron tend to the wounded, bury the dead, and carry food and water.

==Feast of the Dead==
Later in 1669, the Haudenosaunee Feast of the Dead was convened at Caughnawaga. The remains of Tekakwitha&#x27;s parents, along with others, were to be part of the ceremony. Father Pierron criticized the Feast of the Dead, but the assembled Haudenosaunee ordered him to be silent. Afterwards, however, they relented and promised to give up the feast.

==Family pressures==
By the time Tekakwitha turned 17, around 1673, her adoptive mother and aunt tried to arrange her marriage to a young Mohawk man. Tekakwitha fled the cabin and hid in a nearby field and continued to resist marriage. Eventually, her aunts gave up their efforts to get her to marry.

In the spring of 1674, at age eighteen, Tekakwitha met the Jesuit priest Jacques de Lamberville, who was visiting the village. In the presence of others, Tekakwitha told him her story and her desire to become a Christian. She started studying the catechism with him.

==Conversion and Kahnawake==
In his journal, Lamberville wrote about Tekakwitha in the years after her death. This text described her before she was baptized as a mild-mannered girl. Lamberville also stated that Tekakwitha did everything she could to practice her Catholic faith in a non-Catholic society, which often caused minor conflicts with her longhouse residents. The journal, however, does not mention violence toward Tekakwitha, while other sources do.

Lamberville baptized Tekakwitha at the age of 19, on Easter Sunday, April 18, 1676. Tekakwitha was renamed &quot;Catherine&quot; after St. Catherine of Siena (Kateri was the Mohawk form of the name).

She remained in Caughnawauga for another six months. Some Mohawks opposed her conversion and accused her of sorcery. Other members of her village, stoned, threatened, and harassed her. Tekakwitha fled her home and travelled 200 miles to St. Francis Xavier, a Christian Indian mission in Sault Saint-Louis. Tekakwitha found it was a community full of other Native Americans who had also converted. Tekakwitha joined them in 1677.

Tekakwitha was said to have put thorns on her sleeping mat and lain on them while praying for her relatives&#x27; conversion and forgiveness. Piercing the body to draw blood was a traditional practice of the Mohawk and other Haudenosaunee nations. This was cause for controversy for many of the priests in their community citing her already poor health. Tekakwitha pushed back against these concerns saying, &quot;I will willingly abandon this miserable body to hunger and suffering, provided that my soul may have its ordinary nourishment.&quot; Around this time she also began a friendship with another woman named Marie Thérèse Tegaianguenta. The two of them tried to start a Native religious order, but Jesuits rejected that the proposal. She lived at Kahnawake the remaining two years of her life.

Father Cholonec wrote that Tekakwitha said:
The Church considers that her 1679 decision on the Feast of the Annunciation completed Tekakwitha&#x27;s conversion, and the Jesuits described her in early biographies as the &quot;first Iroquois virgin&quot;. Although Tekakwitha is rather often regarded as a consecrated virgin, she could, owing to circumstances, never receive the consecration of virgins by a bishop. Nevertheless, the United States Association of Consecrated Virgins took Kateri Tekakwitha as its patroness.

==Mission du Sault St-Louis: Kahnawake==
The Jesuits had founded Kahnawake for the religious conversion of Native people. When it began, the Natives built their traditional longhouses for residences and gatherings. They also built a longhouse to be used as a chapel by the Jesuits. As a missionary settlement, Kahnawake was at risk of being attacked by members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy who had not converted to Catholicism. (While it attracted other Haudenosaunee, it was predominantly Mohawk, the prominent tribe in eastern New York.)

After Tekakwitha&#x27;s arrival, she shared the longhouse of her older sister and her husband. She would have known other people in the longhouse who had migrated from their former village of Gandaouagué (Caughnawaga). Her mother&#x27;s close friend, Anastasia Tegonhatsiongo, was clan mother of the longhouse. Anastasia and other Mohawk women introduced Tekakwitha to the regular practices of Christianity. This was normal for the women in the village, with many of the missionaries being preoccupied with other religious tasks. Pierre Cholenec reported that &quot;all the Iroquois who come here and then become Christians owe their conversion mainly to the zeal of their relatives&quot;.

Kahnawake was a village set up like normal Haudenosaunee villages, moving from location to location after running out of resources. The village was originally not wholly French, but with northward migration towards Canada started by the Five Nations, the village started to gain more Native members. The Five Nations all happened to start migrating north around the same time, without any communication between them. In Kahnawake, there was representation from multiple tribes, and when the French came there were people from different ethnicities. The village was recognized by New France, and given autonomy to deal with problems that would arise. They were also able to form a friendship with New York through this autonomy.

There was fur trade in Kahnawake. The division between the French Church and the Natives was clear-cut in the village; there were few interactions between the two.

Kahnawake was drawn into a war among the different tribes that lasted around two and a half years.

===Jesuit Missionaries Chauchetière and Cholenec===
Jesuit priests Claude Chauchetière and Pierre Cholenec played important roles in Tekakwitha&#x27;s life. Both were based in New France and Kahnawake. Chauchetière was the first to write a biography of Tekakwitha in 1695, and Cholenec followed in 1696. Cholenec, who had arrived first, introduced traditional items of Catholic mortification, that is, physical deprivation or self-harm, to the converts at Kahnawake. He wanted them to adopt these rather than use Mohawk ritual practices. Both Chauchetière and Tekakwitha arrived in Kahnawake the same year, in 1677.

Chauchetière came to believe that Tekakwitha was a saint. In his biography of Kateri, he stressed her &quot;charity, industry, purity, and fortitude.&quot; In contrast, Cholenec stressed her virginity, perhaps to counter colonial stereotypes characterizing Indian women as promiscuous.

==Death and appearances==
Around Holy Week of 1680, friends noted that Tekakwitha&#x27;s health was failing. When people knew she had but a few hours left, villagers gathered together, accompanied by the priests Chauchetière and Cholenec, the latter providing the last rites. Kateri Tekakwitha died at around 15:00 (3 p.m.) on Holy Wednesday, April 17, 1680, at the age of 23 or 24, in the arms of her friend Marie-Therèse. Chauchetière reports her final words were, &quot;Jesus, Mary, I love you.&quot;

After her death, the people noticed a physical change. Cholenec later wrote, &quot;This face, so marked and swarthy, suddenly changed about a quarter of an hour after her death and became in a moment so beautiful and so white that I observed it immediately.&quot; Her smallpox scars were said to disappear.

Tekakwitha purportedly appeared to three individuals in the weeks after her death; her mentor Anastasia Tegonhatsiongo, her friend Marie-Therèse Tegaiaguenta, and Chauchetière. Anastasia said that, while crying over the death of her spiritual daughter, she looked up to see Tekakwitha &quot;kneeling at the foot&quot; of her mattress, &quot;holding a wooden cross that shone like the sun.&quot; Marie-Thérèse reported that she was awakened at night by a knocking on her wall, and a voice asked if she were awake, adding, &quot;I&#x27;ve come to say good-bye; I&#x27;m on my way to heaven.&quot; Marie-Thérèse went outside but saw no one; she heard a voice murmur, &quot;Adieu, Adieu, go tell the father that I&#x27;m going to heaven.&quot; Chauchetière meanwhile said he saw Tekakwitha at her grave; he said she appeared in &quot;baroque splendor; for two hours he gazed upon her&quot; and &quot;her face lifted toward heaven as if in ecstasy.&quot;

Chauchetière had a chapel built near Kateri&#x27;s gravesite. By 1684, pilgrimages had begun to honor her there. The Jesuits turned her bones to dust and set the ashes within the &quot;newly rebuilt mission chapel.&quot; This symbolized her presence on earth, and her remains were sometimes used as relics for healing.

==Veneration==

The first account of Kateri Tekakwitha was not published until 1715. Because of Tekakwitha&#x27;s unique path to chastity, she is often referred to as a lily, a traditional symbol of purity. Religious images of Tekakwitha are often decorated with a lily and cross, with feathers or turtle as cultural accessories alluding to her Native American birth. Colloquial epithets for Tekakwitha are &quot;The Lily of the Mohawks&quot; (most notable), the &quot;Mohawk Maiden&quot;, the &quot;Pure and Tender Lily&quot;, the &quot;Flower among True Men&quot;, the &quot;Lily of Purity&quot; and &quot;The New Star of the New World&quot;. Her tribal neighbors – and her gravestone – referred to her as &quot;the fairest flower that ever bloomed among the redmen.&quot; Her virtues are considered an ecumenical bridge between Mohawk and European cultures.

Fifty years after her death, a convent for Native American nuns opened in Mexico. Indian Catholic missions and bishops in the 1880s initiated a petition for officially allowing veneration of Kateri. They asked for the veneration of Tekakwitha in tandem with the Jesuits Isaac Jogues and René Goupil, two Catholic missionaries who had been slain by the Mohawk in Osernnenon a few decades before Kateri&#x27;s birth. They concluded their petition by stating that these venerations would help encourage Catholicism among other Native Americans.

The process for Kateri Tekakwitha&#x27;s canonization was initiated by United States Catholics at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1885, followed by Canadian Catholics. Some 906 Native Americans signed 27 letters in the US and Canada urging her canonization. Her spiritual writings were approved by theologians on July 8, 1936, and her cause was formally opened on 19 May 1939, granting her the title of Servant of God.

On January 3, 1943, Pope Pius XII declared her venerable. She was beatified as on June 22, 1980, by Pope John Paul II.

In 2006, a young boy from Whatcom County in Washington state, Jake Finkbonner, was lying near death due to flesh-eating bacteria. According to the parents, the doctors believed he was incurable. Being of Lummi descent, the boy&#x27;s parents knew about Kateri Tekakwitha and prayed to her. Jake survived the ordeal and made a full recovery. His healing was the first of Tekakwitha&#x27;s miracles accepted by the Vatican. 

On December 19, 2011, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints certified a second miracle. She was canonized on October 21, 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI. She is the first Native American woman of North America to be canonized by the Catholic Church.

In 2022, the Episcopal Church of the United States gave final approval to a feast dedicated to Tekakwitha on 17 April on the liturgical calendar.

Kateri Tekakwitha is featured in four national shrines in the United States: the Saint Kateri Tekakwitha National Shrine in Fonda, New York; the National Shrine of the North American Martyrs in Auriesville, New York; the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.; and The National Shrine of the Cross in the Woods, an open-air sanctuary in Indian River, Michigan. The latter shrine&#x27;s design was inspired by Tekakwitha&#x27;s habit of placing small wooden crosses throughout the woods.

===Statues===
There are numerous statues of Tekakwitha, among them are:

* a granite monument in Kahnawake, financed by Clarence A. Walworth.
* the Basilica San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, California
* in St. Kateri Tekakwitha Church in Santa Clarita, California. A statue of Saint Kateri Tekakwitha stands at the steps of Holy Cross School at San Buenaventura Mission in Southern California
* the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in La Crosse, Wisconsin
* the bronze portal of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City.
* the Maryknoll Sisters&#x27; church at Ossining, New York
* St. Patrick&#x27;s church in the St. Stanislaus Kostka parish of Pittsburgh
* Holy Cross Chapel Mausoleum in North Arlington, New Jersey
* a Shrine of St. Kateri Tekakwitha is located in Paris, Stark County, Ohio
* a shrine and church in rural Centre County, Pennsylvania, USA, in the town of Spring Mills.

==Miracles==

Joseph Kellogg was a Protestant child captured by Natives in the eighteenth century and eventually returned to his home. Twelve months later, he caught smallpox. The Jesuits helped treat him, but he was not recovering. They had relics from Tekakwitha&#x27;s grave but did not want to use them on a non-Catholic. One Jesuit told Kellogg that if he would become a Catholic, help would come to him. Joseph did so. The Jesuit gave him a piece of decayed wood from Tekakwitha&#x27;s coffin, which is said to have made him heal. The historian Allan Greer takes this account to mean that Tekakwitha was known in 18th-century New France, and she was already perceived to have healing abilities.

Other miracles were attributed to Tekakwitha: Father Rémy recovered his hearing, and a nun in Montreal was cured by using items formerly belonging to Tekakwitha. Such incidents were evidence that Tekakwitha was possibly a saint. Following the death of a person, sainthood is symbolized by events that show the rejection of death. It is also represented by a duality of pain and neutralization of the other&#x27;s pain (all shown by her reputed miracles in New France). Chauchetière told settlers in La Prairie to pray to Tekakwitha for intercession with illnesses. Due to the Jesuits&#x27; superior system of publicizing material, his words and Tekakwitha&#x27;s fame were said to reach Jesuits in China and their converts.

As people believed in her healing powers, some collected earth from her gravesite and wore it in bags as a relic. One woman said she was saved from pneumonia (&quot;grande maladie du rhume&quot;); she gave the pendant to her husband, who was healed from his disease.

On December 19, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI approved the second miracle needed for Tekakwitha&#x27;s canonization. The authorized miracle dates from 2006, when a young boy in Washington state survived a severe flesh-eating bacterium. Doctors had been unable to stop the disease&#x27;s progress by surgery and advised his parents he was likely to die. The boy received the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick from a Catholic priest. As the boy is half Lummi Indian, the parents said they prayed to Tekakwitha for divine intercession, as did their family and friends, and an extended network contacted through their son&#x27;s classmates. Sister Kateri Mitchell visited the boy&#x27;s bedside and placed a relic of Tekakwitha, a bone fragment, against his body and prayed together with his parents. The next day, the infection stopped its progression.

==Indigenous perspectives==
Mohawk scholar Orenda Boucher noted that, in her opinion, there were &quot;mixed feelings&quot; surrounding the canonization of Tekakwitha. There are traditionalist Mohawk who feel her story was tied into the tragedies of colonization that deeply affected the people of Kahnawake. Despite this dark past, Tekakwitha herself is generally respected among Catholic and traditionalist Mohawk alike. Much of the debate surrounding Tekakwitha&#x27;s canonization is built upon the idea that it was done to bolster the image of the Church among Native Americans. Boucher said to understand the complexities of Takakwitha’s life, it’s important for people to look beyond the biographies written by clergymen who focus on what they consider her Christian virtues. Mohawk writer Doug George-Kanentiio further noted the concern that Tekakwitha&#x27;s sainthood may be used as way to influence Iroquois away from their Indigenous ancestral values, stating:[Tekakwitha&#x27;s sainthood] should never obscure the best elements of our aboriginal spirituality, nor should Kateri’s personal behaviors, given their extremities [i.e., self-mutilation with whips, thorns, and hot coals], be endorsed as a model for women anywhere. . . Women in particular need not kneel in supplication to any man or any god but to rise to dance and sing in true joy. . . We can never accept any institution which actively suppresses women or qualifies their potential. Mohawk journalist Chaz Kader, who was raised Catholic but now practices ancient longhouse traditions, noted that while many traditionalist Mohawk recognize the reverence their Catholic relatives and friends have for Tekakwitha, many remain troubled by the portrayal of her life by the Catholic Church. Kader particularly highlights how church writings describe torment, ostracism, and persecution of Tekakwitha by other Mohawks:I disagree with the characterizations of the ‘other Mohawks’ in the Jesuit accounts of Kateri. . . The contrast of good Mohawks and bad Mohawks still is affecting our people. Some Catholics of Native American and of European ancestries feel her sainthood reflects her unique position as someone who can bridge the two cultures and create unity. Paula E. Holmes interviewed several elderly Native American women in the late 1990s and found that Tekakwitha is &quot;as part of their Indian familiar and familial heritage.&quot;

==Cultural references==
More than 300 books have been published in more than 20 languages on the life of Kateri Tekakwitha. The historian K. I. Koppedrayer has suggested that the Catholic Church fathers&#x27; hagiography of Tekakwitha reflected &quot;trials and rewards of the European presence in the New World.&quot;

===Stage performances===
American composer Nellie von Gerichten Smith (1871–1952) created an opera entitled &quot;Lily of the Mohawks: Kateri Tekakwitha&quot; (text by Edward C. La More). It was not the first stage performance of her life; Joseph Clancy&#x27;s play, &quot;The Princess of the Mohawks&quot;, was performed often by schoolchildren starting in the 1930s.

==Patron of schools and parishes==

Numerous churches, schools and other Catholic institutions have been named for her, particularly since her canonization. Among these are Canadian schools in Kitchener, Markham, Hamilton, Orléans (Ottawa), and Calgary, Alberta. In the United States, Catholic Churches are named after her in Dearborn, MI, Buffalo, TX, Sparta, NJ, Schenectady, NY (parish and school), Irondequoit, NY (parish and school), and Santa Clarita, CA. A school is named after her in Niskayuna, NY.

Kateri Residence, a nursing home in Manhattan, is named for her. The chapel of Welsh Family Hall at the University of Notre Dame, built in 1997, is dedicated to her.

Since 1939, the Tekakwitha Conference meets annually to support Catholic missions among Native Americans. People gather in &quot;Kateri Circles&quot; to pray together, seeking to become better Catholics. In 1991, the conference reported 130 registered Kateri Circles.

Tekakwitha Island () in the St. Lawrence River, part of the Kahnawake reserve, is named after her.

<text>The Royal Institute of British Architects Stirling Prize is a British prize for excellence in architecture. It is named after the architect James Stirling, organised and awarded annually by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). The Stirling Prize is presented to &quot;the architects of the building that has made the greatest contribution to the evolution of architecture in the past year&quot;. The architects must be RIBA members. Until 2014, the building could have been anywhere in the European Union, but since 2015 entries have had to be in the United Kingdom. In the past, the award included a £20,000 prize, but it currently carries no prize money.
==History==
The award was founded in 1996, and is considered to be the most prestigious architecture award in the United Kingdom. The presentation ceremony has been televised by Channel 4. Six shortlisted buildings are chosen from a long-list of buildings that have received a RIBA National Award. These awards are given to buildings showing &quot;high architectural standards and substantial contribution to the local environment&quot;.

In addition to the RIBA Stirling Prize, five other awards are given to buildings on the long-list. In 2015 they consisted of: the RIBA National Award, the RIBA Regional Award, the Manser Medal, the Stephen Lawrence Prize and the RIBA Client of the Year Award. For years prior to 1996, the award was known as the &quot;Building of the Year Award&quot;.

In 2000 several architects from Scotland and Wales made claims of metropolitan bias after five out of seven designs shortlisted by judges were located within London. Critics described the list as &quot;London-centric&quot;. The chairman of the judges in the contest rejected the claims, saying that the first Stirling Prize was awarded to a building in Salford, Greater Manchester.

On 30 September 2020, RIBA announced that the awards had been postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Judges selected the 2021 prize winner from the 2020 shortlist.

<doc id="354678" wikidata="Q2778836" url="?curid=354678" title="River Camel">
<text>The River Camel (, meaning &quot;crooked river&quot;) is a river in Cornwall, England. It rises on the edge of Bodmin Moor and with its tributaries its catchment area covers much of North Cornwall. The river flows into the eastern Celtic Sea between Stepper Point and Pentire Point having covered about making it the second longest river wholly in Cornwall. The river is tidal upstream to Egloshayle and is popular for sailing, birdwatching and fishing. The name &quot;Camel&quot; comes from the Cornish language for &#x27;the crooked one&#x27;, a reference to its winding course. Historically the river was divided into three named stretches. Heyl (, meaning &quot;estuary&quot;) was the name for the estuary up to Egloshayle, the River Allen (, meaning &quot;shining river&quot;) was the stretch between Egloshayle and Trecarne, whilst the Camel was reserved for the stretch of river between its source and Trecarne.

==Geology and hydrology==
The River Camel rises on Hendraburnick Down (UK Grid Reference SX135875) on the edge of Bodmin Moor, an area which forms part of the granite spine of Cornwall. The river&#x27;s course is through sedimentary upper and middle Devonian rocks, predominantly the Upper Delabole Slates, Trevose Slates and Polzeath Slates that stretch to the coast, making a land which has shallow acidic soils. Other than sedimentary rocks, Igneous rocks can be found at Brea Hill and at Pentire Point which is composed mainly of pillow lavas. Across the mouth of the River Camel Stepper Point is composed of greenstone as is The Rumps, a promontory on the north side of Pentire point facing Port Quin Bay.

Mining slate for building purposes has been carried out at various locations along the river, often with small quarries being created near to where the stone was to be used. Today the only active quarry in the whole River Camel catchment area is at Delabole but there has previously been mining for lead and silver on Pentire Head and around Pinkson Creek and a copper mine at Credis above Little Petherick, Further inland the Camel and its tributaries border the St Austell mining lodes near Lanivet, and mines in this area produced tin, lead, silver, and copper. Iron ore in the form of haematite and associated manganese oxides were also mined in the area. Although not considered a great producer, Mulberry Mine near Ruthernbridge produced in the region of 1300 tons of tin between 1859 and 1916. Records show that copper ore was shipped from Padstow to Neath for smelting, and tin and copper ores were the main commodity carried from Guineaport in 1830. Several small China Clay pits also operated in the 19th century around Blisland and St Breward.

The source of the Camel is at above sea level and it has an average incline of 7m/km. The upper reaches of the Camel and its tributaries are mainly moorland giving way to woodland and farmland, predominantly livestock. This means that 64.8% of the catchment is grassland, with a further 14.8% arable land and 12.9% woodland. Of the remaining 7.4%, 4.5% is through urban or built-up areas, 2.7% is mountain, heath and bog and the remainder is inland waters.

The Camel&#x27;s catchment area covers 413 km2 on the western side of Bodmin Moor, and is mainly Devonian slates and granite, with some shales and sandstones. Water volumes are affected by the reservoir at Crowdy Marsh, by abstraction of water for public supply, and by effluent from the sewage system around Bodmin. Data collected by the National River Flow Archive shows that water flow in the River Camel for 2006 was considerably below average. This correlates with reduced rainfall, particularly between the months of June and September. Data from 2013 and 2014 also shows below average annual flow but with points of higher than average flow during Winter.

In a river which runs for much of its length in a steep-sided valley, sudden downpours can cause water levels to rise rapidly and while floods are not unusual on the Camel, the flood of 16 July 1847 was exceptional. Caused by a waterspout and deluge on Davidstow Moor, a wall of water swept away six bridges but Hellandbridge withstood the force of the water, which flowed over the structure leaving debris visible in nearby trees up to above the normal river level. Today the tidal parts of the River Camel are subject to flood risk, especially during spring tides after periods of high rainfall when the catchment is already saturated. The area around Wadebridge has been identified by the Environment Agency as a Critical Drainage Area (CDA) and due to the tidal element the risk is expected to increase due to climate change. This means that all development in the CDA has to take flooding into account including rainfall runoff.

In 2023 the Environment Agency measured water levels on the River Camel at Sladesbridge, Dunmere and Camelford, and also on the rivers Allen and De Lank which are tributaries of the River Camel.

==Estuary==



The Camel Estuary () stretches from Wadebridge downstream to the open sea at Padstow Bay. The quays at Wadebridge are now developed with apartments and retail space on the west bank. North of the quays, the river passes under a concrete bridge carrying the A39 bypass and past the disused Vitriol Quay. Downstream of Burniere Point the valley widens on the right with acres of salt marsh where the River Amble flows in. Here the Cornwall Birdwatching and Preservation Society has hides on both sides of the river; those on the Camel Trail are open to the public. The main river follows the western side of the valley, while on the eastern side a barrage prevents the rising tide from entering the River Amble.

Downstream from the Amble an adit can be found on the foreshore below Dinham Hill, part of Wheal Sisters copper mine. The adit is only accessible from the foreshore at low tide, and is situated near to the location of a tide mill that is recorded at the point where Dinham Creek meets the main river. This mill is shown on a map of the location from the 1830s although no sign of it now remains. Cant Cove lies on the east bank below Cant Hill where the rotting ribs of two ship project from the mud, these being discernable on Google Maps in 2019, and almost opposite Cant Hill on the west bank is Camel Quarry with the piles of waste rock clearly visible above the river and the remains of a quay visible at low water. From here the mud gives way to sand and Gentle Jane, named after a legendary lady who treated the ills of all comers.

From Porthilly Cove on the east bank, the estuary widens and swings to the north. On the west bank, the Camel Trail crosses the triple-span “Iron Bridge” over Little Petherick Creek then passes below Dennis Hill and its obelisk.

The fishing port of Padstow stands on the west bank from where the Black Tor Ferry (officially owned by the Duchy of Cornwall) carries people across the river to Rock.

The mouth of the Camel lies between Stepper Point on the west and Pentire Point on the east, and each headland shelters sandy beaches. On the west side of the estuary, Tregirls beach is protected by Stepper Point. At the northern end of Tregirls beach is Harbour Cove and between here and Hawker&#x27;s Cove evidence has been found of occupation during the Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman periods, and use of Harbour Cove for trading vessels.

In 1827, Padstow Harbour Association chose Hawker&#x27;s Cove as the location for the Padstow lifeboat. Operations were taken over by the RNLI in 1856. A new lifeboat station and slipway were built in 1931 and a second lifeboat stationed at Hawker&#x27;s Cove. The station closed in 1962 because silting rendered the channel too shallow and the building used to house the lifeboat has been converted to residential use. Movement of sand in various parts of the estuary has affected the ability of vessels to access Padstow harbour for many years, and even in May 2020 a navigation warning was issued relating to an increase in size of a spit of sand between Gun Point and St Saviours Point which is considered to have become a serious hazard to navigation.

Beyond Hawkers Cove a sand bar known as the Doom Bar extends across the estuary. This restricts access to Padstow harbour and has been the graveyard of many ships over the years. In the past there was a proposal to build a pier on the doom bar to funnel the tide and thus scour the main channel and keep it navigable, but nothing was ever constructed. A legend as to how the Doom Bar came about describes how a local fisherman is reputed to have shot a mermaid with an arrow, with the result that she cursed Padstow by putting the sandbar between the harbour and the sea.

On the east side of the estuary, the village of Rock is centre for sailing, dinghy racing and marine leisure. From Rock, dunes and intertidal sands extend north as far as Brea Hill. Beyond Brea Hill is Daymer Bay with a beach north of which is the settlement of Trebetherick. The river then flows past Trebetherick Point and swings east over a rocky stretch of foreshore punctuated by sand at Greenaway before reaching the beach at Polzeath, a location for surfing. North of Polzeath, Pentire Point marks the northeast extremity of the estuary.

==Recreation==
The Camel Estuary has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), covering the area between Padstow/Rock and Wadebridge. The estuary comprises part of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

===Angling===
In the 1920s Trout fishing was listed as one of the attractions of the river and today it is known for both Trout and Salmon fishing, and particularly for Sea trout with the fishing season running from 1 May to 15 December. Fishing techniques used include spinning, worm bait and Fly fishing. Fishing from the end of August is covered by a voluntary catch-and-release agreement, and the upper reaches are designated as a fish sanctuary and fishing here is prohibited.

For fishing purposes, the River Camel is considered to be tidal from the mouth up to Egloshayle church.

Although not often mentioned when discussing Bass fishing on the River Camel, the whole of the river is a Bass conservation area with a ban on fishing from boats and an increased minimum size for fish caught from the shore. Sea fishing for Flounder is also a feature of the River Camel, particularly in the sandy parts between Padstow and Cant Hill

===Beaches and bathing===
On the western bank Hawker&#x27;s Cove, Tregirls beach and St Georges Cove lie between Stepper Point and Padstow, while on the eastern bank moving upstream from Pentire Point is Polzeath beach, Daymer Bay and Rock. Water quality is monitored at Polzeath and Daymer Bay with water classification for the years 2012 to 2015 for both locations being &quot;Excellent&quot;. Water quality was previously monitored at Rock, results from 2007 for all three locations on the eastern bank of the river being either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot;.

===Mountain biking===
The steep-sided parts of the Camel valley are ideal for mountain biking, and several trails are maintained. Particularly accessible are those on land owned by the Forestry Commission at Cardinham Woods and Hustyns Woods.

===Walking===

The Camel Trail, used by walkers and cyclists, follows the trackbed of the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway from Wenfordbridge, past the outskirts of Bodmin at Dunmere, and through Wadebridge to Padstow.

From Poleys Bridge near Wenfordbridge, the Camelford Way follows the valley of the River Camel further up to the town of Camelford.

The South West Coast Path follows the River Camel from Pentire Point to Rock, and from Padstow to Stepper Point. It crosses the river using the Black Tor Ferry.

The Saints&#x27; Way footpath links Padstow with Fowey. It follows first the River Camel, and then Little Petherick Creek from Padstow to Little Petherick, before striking inland and crossing the county to the River Fowey. This route is a very ancient one used by travellers from Ireland and Wales making for Brittany and wishing to avoid the dangerous seas around Lands End.

===Water sports===
Canoeing and Kayaking take place on the river Camel with a dedicated access point just above the bridge at Wadebridge. Further up there are stretches that are particularly favoured such as between Tuckingmill to Penrose which has grade 2 rapids.

Water skiing takes place on the estuary based in Rock, with four set courses located between Dennis cove and Pinkson creek. Rock is also a centre for sailing with the Rock Sailing and Waterski Club being founded in 1938

Daymer Bay and Hawkers Cove are good locations for Kitesurfing, particularly freestyle and wakestyle. These locations being on opposite sides of the river provide between them kitesurfing opportunities for all wind directions, although kitesurfing is not allowed at either venue during the daytime in July and August. Kitesurfing UK list Hawkers cove as one of their favourite kitesurfing spots in Cornwall.

==Wildlife and conservation==
The majority of the Camel Estuary, from Padstow/Porthilly upstream to Wadebridge are part of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and thus considered worthy of special landscape protection. There are also five Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) along the length of the Camel. Four small SSSIs at Harbour Cove, Rock Dunes, Trebetherick Point and Pentire Peninsula are on the estuary, while the River Camel Valley and Tributaries SSSI covers much of the Camel Valley between Egloshayle and Blisland, and extends in several further sections of varying size up to its source. This SSSI also includes much of the River Allen, a tributary which flows into the river immediately upstream of Egloshayle, and some smaller unnamed tributaries. In addition, there is an SSSI at Amble Marshes on the River Amble which flows into the Camel Estuary between Wadebridge and Rock.

The River Camel was designated by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee as a Special Area of Conservation in April 2005 as being of European importance for the otter and the bullhead, and this was reviewed in 2015. However publicly available information on the area is unclear as the DEFRA Joint Nature Conservation Committee website shows the area stretching from Pinkson Creek on the Camel estuary up to Polbrock bridge, but incorporating Pinkson Creek, the River Allen to just upstream of Sladesbridge, and the Polmorla Brook almost to the edge of the Wadebridge built-up area, and incorporating all of the intertidal zone. In contrast, both the Marine Conservation Institute and ProtectedPlanet show the area from Wadebridge bridge upstream, including the Ruthern, Allen, De Lank and Stannon, all being shown as covered to their respective sources., the only part of this area considered tidal is between Wadebridge bridge and St Marys church Egloshayle.

There are two nature reserves on Camel and its tributaries. The Walmsley sanctuary of the Cornwall Birdwatching and Preservation Society is on the Amble marshes on the River Amble above Trewornan Bridge. Hawke&#x27;s Wood reserve, owned by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, is on the south side of the Camel Valley between Wadebridge and Dunmere. Here is an abandoned quarry in a mature woodland of predominantly sessile oak, this latter habitat also being named as contributary to the Special Area of Conservation listing.

===Birds===
With the large areas of salt marsh on the estuary, the river provides an excellent location for birds. Large flocks of waders can be seen in winter, preyed on by peregrine falcons, and a migrant osprey often pauses a few days to fish in spring and autumn. Mute swans nest at several locations, particularly near to the bridge in Wadebridge. Shelduck, shoveler and mallard are found on the river and teal further upstream.

A belted kingfisher was seen in the 1980s for only the second time in England and the estuary has been noted for early colonisation by egret species. In the 1980s and 1990s little egrets were to be seen on mudflats at low tide, and more recently large numbers of cattle egrets have been found on the River Amble and near Burniere, and have now become sufficiently common not to require corroborating evidence when reporting sightings.

Upstream and on several of its tributaries, kingfishers can be seen, while the Cornwall Wildlife Trust reserve at Hawkes Wood is noted for nuthatches and tawny owls.

There are three birdwatching hides overlooking the River Camel. Tregunna Hide (Grid reference SW 969 738), owned by Cornwall County Council, is located by the Camel Trail and is open to the public. Burniere Hide (Grid Reference SW 982 740) is owned by the Cornwall Birdwatching and Preservation Society (CBWPS) is open to members. In addition the CBWPS own the Walmsley Sanctuary which covers over on the River Amble, with two further hides for use by its members. The Walmsley sanctuary is nationally important for wintering waders and wildfowl. These hides are located on the estuary below Wadebridge while upstream of Wadebridge there is a hide overlooking Treraven Meadow located 500m from Guineaport towards Bodmin

Sometimes nationally rare bird species have been recorded in the Camel valley or on one of the major tributaries. In 2010 an American bittern was recorded on the River Amble having flown in from the River Camel nearby, and in 2016 a Dalmatian pelican was recorded on the River Camel at various locations between Rock and Dinham

===Fish===
The estuary is a sea bass conservation area. This was originally designated as being upstream from a line drawn between Stepper Point and Trebetherick Point but this was extended to include all waters upstream of a line between Stepper Point and Pentire Point in 1999. Surfers at Polzeath have recounted seeing bass swimming around their surfboards in summer. Flounders can be found in the brackish waters around the entrance to Little Petherick Creek, and Daymer Bay is noted as a location for fishing from the rocks.

Egg cases from shark and ray species are regularly found on the beaches near the mouth of the river, and have been recorded as far up as Porthilly and Dennis Cove. Species whose egg cases have been identified include Small-spotted catshark, Small-eyed Ray, Spotted Ray, Nursehound, Cuckoo Ray, Blonde Ray, Undulate Ray, and Thornback Ray.

Salmon and sea trout are found in the River Camel and have been fished since the 12th century when the Priory at Bodmin constructed a Salmon weir near Dunmere and Salmon is named as a contributary species in the designation of the River Camel as a Special Area of Conservation. More recently the Camel had a reputation for good runs of both salmon and sea trout up to the early 2000s, particularly in the area around Bodmin, but there was a rapid decline in the late 2010s leading to the Environment Agency placing restrictions on salmon fishing in the river in 2017. There have also been significant reductions in catches of sea trout and while a total of over 900 fish were caught in 2010, this reduced to less than 300 fish in 2016.

Occasionally basking sharks can be seen at the mouth of the river and very occasionally bottlenose dolphins can be seen. The largest and most unusual fish reported to have been found in the river was a sturgeon weighing which was stranded by the outgoing tide in June 1887.

===Flora===
By the Atlantic Ocean the flora is distinctly maritime, characterised by thrift and sea campion on exposed clifftops and spring squill and heather in the turf. Stunted blackthorn and gorse tolerate more exposed sites, while the quarry on Stepper Point is home to many species of marsh plants. Above Egloshayle there are beds of yellow flag iris while the wooded slopes of the valley are filled with bluebells in spring.

The camel is home to two invasive non-native species; Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam. Both are the subject of manual control on various stretches of the river.

The valley and its immediate environs are, in parts, thickly wooded with managed plantations at Cardinham and Dunmere near Bodmin and Bishop&#x27;s, Hustyn, and Grogley Woods between Bodmin and Wadebridge all managed by the Forestry Commission with mature Douglas fir as well as mixed deciduous trees. Before that the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway planted avenues of elm Trees along the line of the railway, and there were also elms near the railway between Wadebridge and Padstow, now gone as a result of Dutch elm disease. Another tree that is uncommon, but is found in the Camel valley is the wild service tree, an indicator of ancient woodland or hedgerows.

===Mammals===
The Camel and its tributaries are home to otters. These were hunted up to the early 20th century but are now one of the species cited in the River Camel and Tributaries SSSI.

Red deer and roe deer can both be seen in the valleys of the River Camel and its tributaries, with roe deer being the more common.

Badgers can be found throughout the Camel Valley, but in 2016 DEFRA announced a badger cull zone covering North Cornwall, the boundary of which encompasses the rivers Camel and Allen. The cull, which resulted in over 1500 badgers being killed in North Cornwall in 2016, is intended to reduce instances of Bovine TB but has proved controversial.

===Molluscs===
The beaches and cliffs around the mouth of the River Camel are home to a variety of marine molluscs, and on beaches exposed to longshore drift one can also find shells washed up with the tide, particularly after westerly storms. Common limpet, blue mussel and the barnacle (Chthamalus stellatus) are commonly found on rocks that are covered at high tide, with dog whelk and common periwinkle found in tidal rockpools. The banded wedge shell and blunt tellin (Arcopagia crassa) can also be found as far upstream as Padstow.

==History and infrastructure==

===Transport and Industry===
Cornwall is an undulating county with high cliffs, rough moors and deep valleys, so rivers have been used for transport throughout history. Being one of the few safe havens on the north coast of Cornwall, the Camel Estuary has been used since Roman times and most likely earlier, and by the 18th century the port of Padstow was the second largest importer of coal in Cornwall after Falmouth. The river has previously been navigable beyond Wadebridge with the highest quays being at Guineaport and Egloshayle, and ships were recorded beyond that at least as far as Pendavy a mile further upstream while Polbrock was given as the limit of navigation in 1814. The river as far as Wadebridge was considered navigable for vessels up to 150 tons in 1830 and Wadebridge was used as the location for loading granite, iron ore and china Clay onto ships for onward transport. Advice from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency published in 2003 indicates that the River is now only navigable for merchant vessels as far as Brea Hill.

During the period of canal building in Britain the River Camel was investigated as one end of a canal looking to join the north and south coasts of Cornwall by linking to the River Fowey. The first plan, often referred to as the &quot;Polbrock Canal&quot; was put forward in 1794 and engineer John Rennie was engaged to advise on the idea. The canal was intended to be deep and wide, but Rennie advised that a tunnel would be required on the route and that little through traffic could be anticipated so no further effort was expended. Soon after in 1796 an act of Parliament was passed authorising a canal from Guineaport to Dunmere with a branch to Ruthernbridge but in the event no start was made and the scheme lapsed. In the 1820s Marc Brunel, the father of Isambard Kingdom Brunel considered the possibility of a ship canal looking to make a connection similar to that proposed in 1794 between the rivers Camel and Fowey but again little return on the investment was predicted and nothing was built.

With boats as one of the main methods of transporting goods until the advent of the railways there were several quays along the river, often at the limit of navigation of the many tributaries and creeks on the estuary. There were quays at Little Petherick and Trevorrick Mills on Little Petherick Creek and before construction of the railway between Wadebridge and Padstow there was a quay at Pinxton Creek. Also on the south bank of the estuary two quays served the nearby Camel Quarry and Penquean Quarry, the quays being used to export the slate quarried there and, as the slate was raised from up to depth, to bring in coal for the two engines used for pumping and sawing, although both quarries had ceased operation before the railway line separated them from the river. Joining the main river upstream of Camel Quarry, the River Amble was navigable up to Chapel Amble on high spring tides, with seaweed, sand and coal being taken up to the village and grain brought out again. Construction of the bridge at Trewornan did not prevent access to Chapel Amble, but the tidal barrage which prevents salt water going upstream past Burniere Point has left the River Amble inaccessible from the main river. Nearer to Wadebridge there was a quay at Trevilling on the north bank of the river built in the 19th century for a Vitriol works and thus known as the &#x27;Vitriol Quay&#x27;, the location downstream from the town near the current A39 Wadebridge Bypass bridge being appropriate for the product.

Despite the many opportunities for transport along the estuary, historically the main traffic on the river above Padstow was to the Quays at Wadebridge where there is evidence of a dock dating back as far as Elizabethan times, and in 1830 the limit of navigation was recorded as Guineaport. Construction of the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway in 1834 was based on taking sand brought up to Wadebridge by 12 ton barges that were poled under the bridge at Wadebridge with the sand then being transhipped to the railway for onward transport. From a specially built sand dock at Wadebridge the railway took the sand further up the valley, replacing the previous use of pack animals that took the sand from landings at Sladesbridge and a quay at Marsh cottages near Egloshayle church.

In common with much of Cornwall lime was a common commodity for transportation in the 18th and 19th centuries and the Camel was no exception with lime kilns being recorded at Egloshayle with a quay adjacent, another at Bishop&#x27;s Quay below Gonvena Hill, and one on the town side of the river adjacent to the Pomorla brook The furthest downstream was a lime kiln at the small inlet where the current sewage works is located.

On the estuary itself there was no need to transport sand by barge, and &#x27;sanding lanes&#x27; were laid from local villages directly onto the foreshore so that carts could be taken down at low tide and loaded with sand. On the southern side of the estuary &#x27;sanding lanes&#x27; linked Higher Halwyn to Oldtown Cove, Tregunna to the River at White House, Tregonce to Little Petherick Creek and also St Issey to Benuick near Sea Mills, also on Little Petherick Creek. On the northern side of the estuary the access lane to Daymer Bay has its origins as a sanding lane.

===Historic sites===
There are several ancient defensive sites along the Camel Valley. Penhargard Castle is an Iron Age defended settlement near Helland situated high on the eastern side of the Camel valley with extant ramparts up to , and not far away on the other side of the river is an older hillfort. Rather earlier in date is Killibury Castle above Egloshayle which originates from the late Bronze Age, was in use throughout the Iron Age and was re-occupied during the Roman period. It is a scheduled monument of national importance. Also Roman in date but several miles up the valley there is the remains of a Roman fort near Nanstallon overlooking the river which was once thought to have been the only Roman Fort in Cornwall, and was only occupied between 60 and 80AD. Less certain is the association of a Roman legion with the area around Cant Hill. The evidence in circumstantial, with the name Cant being associated with the Latin &quot;canti&quot; meaning &#x27;corner&#x27; and nearby Carlyon Farm through a spelling from the 13th century of Carleghion being interpreted as &quot;car&quot; meaning camp and &quot;leighion&quot; meaning legion, while the name Cant is attributed by others to ownership by the De Cant family. Although Cant Hill may not have any substantiated links to the Roman period, Roman coins, ornaments and pottery have been found in the area of Brea Hill where there is believed to have been a Roman camp.

There was at one time a small chapel located at St Saviours point downstream of Padstow where a monk would keep a light at night to assist shipping, and it is considered likely that this was associated with Bodmin Priory which held land at Padstow, although the provision of this light ceased with the dissolution of the monasteries. More certainly associated with Bodmin Priory is the building of the bridge over the Camel at Dunmere in the 12th Century and the small chapel that stood on the Bodmin side of the river at the location that is now known as St Annes Chapel Hayes.

===Crossings===
Wherever there are rivers, people will need to cross them. Routes of ancient trackways and Roman Roads in Cornwall are, at best, open to speculation but although most maps of Roman Roads show nothing west of Isca Dumnoniorum (modern Exeter) there is some evidence of Romans creating or using roads or paths in the county in the shape of Roman Milestones. The routes of the three main roads through Cornwall, following generally the alignment of the current A30, A38 and A39 are believed to have ancient origins, and if this is true then there would need to be a historic crossing of the Camel, most likely somewhere near Wadebridge. There is no record of how old the ford at Wadebridge is, but it is likely of great antiquity. There is also some speculation of a further ancient ford of the Camel in the area around Camelford, which in the same manner is likely near to the route of the current road through the town.

Further down towards the sea, the Black Tor Ferry has crossed the estuary between Padstow and Rock since 1337, the title to run the ferry resting with the Duchy of Cornwall.

The natural progression for a road crossing a river or stream is to replace the ford with a bridge, and the River Camel and tributaries are crossed by more listed bridges than any other river in Cornwall with the most notable being at Wadebridge. Referred to as &quot;the longest and fairest bridge in Cornwall&quot; it was the furthest bridge downstream on the river until the opening of the A39 Wadebridge bypass in 1993. Built in the 15th century Wadebridge bridge was built by John de Harlan at the instigation of Vicar of Egloshayle Thomas Loveybond and replaced an earlier ford which was considered so dangerous to use at certain times that a chapel was built on either bank; one to pray for a safe crossing and the other to give thanks. The bridge was made a county bridge in the reign of James I, and has been widened three times over the years, being granted Grade II listed status in 1969.

Moving upstream from Wadebridge, the other listed bridges are Helland Bridge, Wenfordbridge, Coombe Mill Bridge, Gam Bridge, and Slaughterbridge, this latter so named as it is the location of an historic battle, possibly that of King Arthur&#x27;s last battle. While the heritage value of ancient crossings is great, continued use of structures that are several hundred years old and that were designed and built with lighter and less frequest traffic in mind can have a deleterious effect on the fabric of these bridges. Helland Bridge was added to the Historic England Heritage at Risk Register in 2020 citing an &quot;Immediate risk of further rapid deterioration or loss of fabric&quot; This is perhaps unsurprising as Hellandbridge is still completely original, while Wenfordbridge and Gam Bridge, along with Pendavey, Dunmere, Poley&#x27;s and Tresarret bridges, were broken by the flood of 1847 and were subsequently rebuilt.

One of the largest structures on the Estuary is the &quot;Iron Bridge&quot;, a three span girder bridge of originally built to carry the North Cornwall Railway between Wadebridge and Padstow over Petherick Creek. Good use was made of the river during construction as the metalwork was brought to Wadebridge by boat and then floated on barges down to where the bridge was being built. Sitting on Dennis Hill overlooking the bridge is an Obelisk erected to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria&#x27;. Erected in 1889 the granite obelisk is Grade II listed.

===Military===
Although the River itself has never been a location for military bases, some parts have been used periodically for military purposes. Other than the Roman forts noted above, one of the earliest military installations was at Gun Point just downstream of Padstow. Henry VIII sited guns here when there was considered a threat of invasion by the Spanish, and Queen Elizabeth expanded these, and guns were also sited here during the Napoleonic wars. In 1940 during World War II a pair of 4 inch naval guns were mounted on Gun Point, the installation being known as Padstow Coastal Gun Battery. The guns were replaced in 1942 with a pair of larger guns but these in turn were removed in July 1945, although some remains of the installation was still extant in 2018.

==Water pollution incident==

In July 1988, the water supply to Camelford and the surrounding area was contaminated when 20 tons of aluminium sulphate was poured into the wrong tank at Lowermoor Water Treatment Works on Bodmin Moor. An inquiry into the incident (the worst of its kind in British history) started in 2002, and a report was issued in January 2005 but questions remain as to the long-term effects on the health of residents. Michael Meacher, who visited Camelford as environment minister, called the incident and its aftermath, &quot;A most unbelievable scandal.&quot;

==Tributaries and their names==
The main tributaries of the River Camel are the Allen, the Ruthern, the De Lank and the Stannon. Other tributaries include Little Petherick Creek which joins the main estuary through the Iron Bridge on the Camel Trail, the River Amble which joins the Camel though a tidal barrage near Burniere Point, and the Polmorla Brook (historically Treguddick Brook) which joins the Camel immediately above the bridge at Wadebridge.

In terms of its name there is evidence that what is now known as the River Camel has had several names in the past. The name Camel is derived from Middle Cornish &quot;Cam-El&quot;, &quot;Crooked one&quot;, and seems originally to have referred only to the upper parts.
The lower part of the river was referred to as the River Allen, a common Celtic river name of unknown derivation, but the names were somewhat interchangeable, and even a hybrid Camb-alan wss recorded in the 16th Century.
By the 19th Century the name Allen was exclusively used for the River Layne which flows into the Camel just above Egloshayle and the name Camel applied to the whole length of the river. The Camel estuary appears to have been called the River Hayle from Middle Cornish &quot;Hayle&quot;, &quot;estuary&quot; and while this may have been as much a description as a proper name, the continued use of the name Hayle Bay for the bay containing Polzeath beach supports this. In turn it has been suggested that the River Layne may have previously been called the River Dewi given the number of places along its course which contain the element.

<text>Road traffic safety refers to the methods and measures, such as traffic calming, to prevent road users from being killed or seriously injured. Typical road users include pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, passengers of vehicles, and passengers of on-road public transport, mainly buses and trams.

Best practices in modern road safety strategy: 
As sustainable solutions for classes of road safety have not been identified, particularly low-traffic rural and remote roads, a hierarchy of control should be applied, similar to classifications used to improve occupational safety and health. At the highest level is sustainable prevention of serious injury and death crashes, with sustainable requiring all key result areas to be considered. At the second level is real-time risk reduction, which involves providing users at severe risk with a specific warning to enable them to take mitigating action. The third level is about reducing the crash risk which involves applying the road-design standards and guidelines (such as from AASHTO), improving driver behavior and enforcement. It is important to note that drivers&#x27; traffic behaviors are significantly influenced by their perceptions and attitudes.

Traffic safety has been studied as a science for more than 75 years.

==Background==

Road traffic crashes have become one of the world&#x27;s largest public-health and injury-prevention problems. The issue is all the more acute because the victims are overwhelmingly healthy before their crashes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 1 million people are killed on the world&#x27;s roads each year. A report published by the WHO in 2004 estimated that some 1.2 million people were killed and 50 million injured in traffic collisions on the roads around the world each year and that traffic accidents were the leading cause of death among children 10–19 years of age. The report also noted that the problem was most severe in developing countries and that simple prevention-measures could halve the number of deaths.

The standard measures used in assessing road safety interventions are fatalities and killed-or-seriously-injured (KSI) rates, usually expressed per billion (109) passenger kilometres. Countries using older road-safety paradigms replace KSI rates with crash rates – for example, crashes per million vehicle-miles.

Vehicle speed within the human tolerances for avoiding serious injury and death is a key goal of modern road-design, because impact speed affects the severity of injury both to vehicle occupants and to pedestrians. For occupants, Joksch (1993) found the probability of death for drivers in multi-vehicle collisions increased as the fourth power of impact speed (often referred to by the mathematical term δv (&quot;delta V&quot;), meaning change in velocity). Injuries are caused by sudden, severe acceleration (or deceleration); this is difficult to measure. However, crash reconstruction techniques can estimate vehicle speeds before a crash. Therefore, the change in speed is used as a surrogate for acceleration. This enabled the Swedish Road Administration to identify the KSI risk curves using actual crash-reconstruction data which led to the human tolerances for serious injury and death referenced above.

Interventions are generally much easier to identify in the modern road-safety paradigm, which focusses on the human tolerances for serious injury and death. For example, the elimination of head-on KSI crashes simply required the installation of an appropriate median crash-barrier. Also, roundabouts, often with speed-reducing approaches, feature very few KSI crashes.

The old road-safety paradigm of purely crash risk is a far more complex matter. Contributing factors to highway crashes may be related to the driver (such as driver error, illness, or fatigue), the vehicle (brake, steering, or throttle failures), or the road itself (lack of sight distance, poor roadside clear- zones, etc.). Interventions may seek to reduce or compensate for these factors, or to reduce the severity of crashes. A comprehensive outline of interventions areas can be seen in management systems for road safety. Study conducted in Finland revealed that the fatality risk is increased most when a collision type is either pedestrian or meeting of the vehicles.

In addition to management systems, which apply predominantly to networks in built-up areas, another class of interventions relates to the design of roadway networks for new districts. Such interventions explore the configurations of a network that will inherently reduce the probability of collisions.

Interventions for the prevention of road traffic injuries are often evaluated; the Cochrane Library has published a wide variety of reviews of interventions for the prevention of road-traffic injuries.

For the purposes of road-traffic safety it can be helpful to classify roads into three usages: 
* built-up urban streets with slower speeds, greater densities, and more diversity among road users
* non built-up rural roads with higher speeds
*major highways (motorways/ Interstates/ freeways/ Autobahns, autostrade, etc.) reserved for motor-vehicles, and which are often designed to minimize and attenuate crashes

Most injuries occur on urban streets but most fatalities on rural roads, while motorways are the safest in relation to distance traveled. For example, in 2013, German autobahns carried 31% of motorized road traffic (in travel-kilometres) while accounting for 13% of Germany&#x27;s traffic deaths. The autobahn fatality-rate of 1.9 deaths per billion-travel-kilometres compared favorably with the 4.7 rate on urban streets and 6.6 rate on rural roads.

== History ==

Roadways originally carried all sorts of traffic indiscriminately - beasts of burden as well as pedestrians. Road behavior and rules have developed to prioritize certain types of traffic.

Important people traversing crowded streets and alleys in ancient Rome (famous for its Roman roads) deployed minions to clear the way for their litters or (if allowed) carts and chariots.
Even the mighty preferred not to trample the bystanders.

In the 19th century the advent of powered vehicles inspired British road-safety law to impose speed limits and to require a person on foot carrying a red flag warning of the arrival of a frightening noisy mechanical contrivance.

Subsequently, motoring lobby-groups pressed for the priority of motorized traffic, and safety laws drove playing children off the streets and ghettoized the likes of walkers, bicycles, wheel-chairs and scooters to the margins.
Concepts like shared space, living streets and woonerven developed to counter this paradigm.

==Mortality ==
===Mortality units===
According to the WHO/IRTAD:
===Mortality statistics===



===Built-up areas===


On neighborhood roads where many vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and bicyclists can be found, traffic calming can be a tool for road safety. Though not strictly a traffic calming measure, mini-traffic circles implanted in normal intersections of neighbourhood streets have been shown to reduce collisions at intersections dramatically (see picture). Shared space schemes, which rely on human instincts and interactions, such as eye contact, for their effectiveness, and are characterised by the removal of traditional traffic signals and signs, and even by the removal of the distinction between carriageway (roadway) and footway (sidewalk), are also becoming increasingly popular. Both approaches can be shown to be effective.

For planned neighbourhoods, studies recommend new network configurations, such as the Fused Grid or 3-Way Offset. These layout models organize a neighbourhood area as a zone of no cut-through traffic by means of loops or dead-end streets. They also ensure that pedestrians and bicycles have a distinct advantage by introducing exclusive shortcuts by path connections through blocks and parks. Such a principle of organization is referred to as &quot;Filtered Permeability&quot; implying a preferential treatment of active modes of transport. These new patterns, which are recommended for laying out neighbourhoods, are based on analyses of collision data of large regional districts and over extended periods. They show that four-way intersections combined with cut-through traffic are the most significant contributors to increased collisions.

Modern safety barriers are designed to absorb impact energy and minimize the risk to the occupants of cars and bystanders. For example, most side rails are now anchored to the ground, so that they cannot skewer a passenger compartment. Most light poles are designed to break at the base rather than violently stop a car that hits them. Some road fixtures such as signs and fire hydrants are designed to collapse on impact. authorities have removed trees in the vicinity of roads; while the idea of &quot;dangerous trees&quot; has attracted a certain amount of skepticism, unforgiving objects such as trees can cause severe damage and injury to errant road users. Safety barriers can provide some combination of physical protection and visual protection depending on their environment. Physical protection is important for protecting sensitive building and pedestrian areas. Visual protection is necessary to alert drivers to changes in road patterns.

Most roads are cambered (crowned), that is, made so that they have rounded surfaces, to reduce standing water and ice, primarily to prevent frost damage but also increasing traction in poor weather. Some sections of road are now surfaced with porous bitumen to enhance drainage; this is particularly done on bends. These are just a few elements of highway engineering. As well as that, there are often grooves cut into the surface of cement highways to channel water away, and rumble strips at the edges of highways to rouse inattentive drivers with the loud noise they make when driven over. In some cases, there are raised markers between lanes to reinforce the lane boundaries; these are often reflective. In pedestrian areas, speed bumps are often placed to slow cars, preventing them from going too fast near pedestrians.

Poor road surfaces can lead to safety problems. If too much asphalt or bituminous binder is used in asphalt concrete, the binder can &#x27;bleed&#x27; or flush&#x27; to the surface, leaving a very smooth surface that provides little traction when wet. Certain kinds of stone aggregate become very smooth or polished under the constant wearing action of vehicle tyres, again leading to poor wet-weather traction. Either of these problems can increase wet-weather crashes by increasing braking distances or contributing to loss of control. If the pavement is insufficiently sloped or poorly drained, standing water on the surface can also lead to wet-weather crashes due to hydroplaning.

Lane markers in some countries and states are marked with cat&#x27;s eyes, Botts&#x27; dots or reflective raised pavement markers that do not fade like paint. Botts dots are not used where it is icy in the winter, because frost and snowplows can break the glue that holds them to the road, although they can be embedded in short, shallow trenches carved in the roadway, as is done in the mountainous regions of California.

Road hazards and intersections in some areas are now usually marked several times, roughly five, twenty, and sixty seconds in advance so that drivers are less likely to attempt violent manoeuvres.

Most road signs and pavement marking materials are retro-reflective, incorporating small glass spheres or prisms to more efficiently reflect light from vehicle headlights back to the driver&#x27;s eyes.

====Turning across traffic====
Turning across traffic (i.e., turning left in right-hand drive countries, turning right in left-hand drive countries) poses several risks. The more serious risk is a collision with oncoming traffic. Since this is nearly a head-on collision, injuries are common. It is the most common cause of fatalities in a built-up area. Another major risk is involvement in a rear-end collision while waiting for a gap in oncoming traffic.

Countermeasures for this type of collision include:
* Addition of left turn lanes
* Providing protected turn phasing at signalized intersections
* Using indirect turn treatments such as the Michigan left
* Converting conventional intersections to roundabouts

In the absence of these facilities as a driver about to turn:
* Keep your wheels straight, so that in the event of a rear end shunt, you are not pushed into on-coming traffic.
* When you think it is clear, look away, to the road that you are entering. There is an optical illusion that, after a time, presents an oncoming vehicle as further away and travelling slower. Looking away breaks this illusion.

There is no presumption of negligence which arises from the bare fact of a collision at an intersection, and circumstances may dictate that a left turn is safer than to turn right. The American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) recommends in their publication Geometric Design of Highways and Streets that left or right turns are to be provided the &quot;same&quot; time gap. Some states have recognized this in statute, and a presumption of negligence is only raised &quot;because&quot; of the &quot;turn&quot; if and only if the turn was prohibited by an erected sign.

Turns across traffic have been shown to be problematic for older drivers.

====Designing for pedestrians and cyclists====

Pedestrians and cyclists are among the most vulnerable road users and in some countries constitute over half of all road deaths. Interventions aimed at improving safety of non-motorised users:

* Sidewalks (or pavements in British English) of suitable width for pedestrian traffic
* Pedestrian crossings close to the desire line which allow pedestrians to cross roads safely
* Segregated pedestrian routes and cycle lanes away from the main highway
* Overbridges (tend to be unpopular with pedestrians and cyclists due to additional distance and effort)
* Underpasses (these can pose heightened risk from crime if not designed well, can work for cyclists in some cases)
* Traffic calming and speed humps
* Intersection daylighting to enhance visibility
* Low speed limits that are rigorously enforced, possibly by speed cameras
* Shared space schemes giving ownership of the road space and equal priority to all road users, regardless of mode of use
* Pedestrian barriers to prevent pedestrians crossing dangerous locations
* Cycling infrastructure
* Protected intersection

American passive traffic safety measures which were adopted in the mid-20th century created roadways which were forgiving to motorists traveling at high speeds but which de-prioritized cycling and pedestrian facilities. Passive traffic safety policies led to excessively wide streets, clear zones adjacent to roadways, wide turn radii and a focus on protecting drivers from the consequences of high speeds. Passive traffic safety measures sought to avoid influencing the behavior of drivers while giving automobiles maximum convenience. Recent complete street policies seek to create design-oriented traffic safety improvements which actively slow drivers down by narrowing roadways while better accommodating pedestrians and cyclists.

Pedestrians&#x27; advocates question the equitability of schemes if they impose extra time and effort on the pedestrian to remain safe from vehicles, for example overbridges with long slopes or steps up and down, underpasses with steps and addition possible risk of crime and at-grade crossings off the desired crossing line. Make Roads Safe was criticised in 2007 for proposing such features. Successful pedestrian schemes tend to avoid over-bridges and underpasses and instead use at-grade crossings (such as pedestrian crossings) close to the intended route. Successful cycling schemes by contrast avoid frequent stops even if some additional distance is involved, because cyclists expend more energy when starting off.

In Costa Rica 57% of road deaths are pedestrians. However, a partnership between AACR, Cosevi, MOPT and iRAP has proposed the construction of 190 km of pedestrian footpaths and 170 pedestrian crossings which could save over 9000 fatal or serious injuries over 20 years.

====Shared space====

By 1947 the Pedestrians&#x27; Association was suggesting that many of the safety features being introduced (speed limits, traffic calming, road signs and road markings, traffic lights, Belisha beacons, pedestrian crossings, cycle lanes, etc.) were potentially self-defeating because &quot;every nonrestrictive safety measure, however admirable in itself, is treated by the drivers as an opportunity for more speeding, so that the net amount of danger is increased and the latter state is worse than the first.&quot;

During the 1990s a new approach, known as &#x27;shared space&#x27; was developed which removed many of these features in some places has attracted the attention of authorities around the world. The approach was developed by Hans Monderman who believed that &quot;if you treat drivers like idiots, they act as idiots&quot; and proposed that trusting drivers to behave was more successful than forcing them to behave. Professor John Adams, an expert on risk compensation, suggested that traditional traffic engineering measures assumed that motorists were &quot;selfish, stupid, obedient automatons who had to be protected from their own stupidity&quot; and non-motorists were treated as &quot;vulnerable, stupid, obedient automatons who had to be protected from cars – and their own stupidity&quot;.

Reported results indicate that the &#x27;shared space&#x27; approach leads to significantly reduced traffic speeds, the virtual elimination of road casualties, and a reduction in congestion. Living streets share some similarities with shared spaces. The woonerven also sought to reduce traffic speeds in community and housing zones by the use of lower speed limits enforced by the use of special signage and road markings, the introduction of traffic calming measures, and by giving pedestrians priority over motorists.

===Non-built-up areas===

Roads outside built-up areas, also known as rural roads not including motorways, are roads which are not classified as urban road and which are not classified as motorway.
In the European Union, this is the kind of road with the most people killed (54.3%) in 2015, more than inside urban areas (36.8%). However, such numbers might change country by country.

Fatalities on the rural roads come from the many collisions due to the dangers that exist on such roads, and the important energy involved in those collisions due to the practiced speeds. In contrast, risks of collision are less numerous on motorways, and speeds are lower on rural roads.

===Major highways===


Major highways including motorways, freeways, Autobahnen, autostrade and interstates are designed for safer high-speed operation and generally have lower levels of injury per vehicle km than other roads; for example, in 2013, the German autobahn fatality rate of 1.9 deaths per billion-travel-kilometers compared favorably with the 4.7 rate on urban streets and 6.6 rate on rural roads.

Safety features include:
*Limited access from the properties and local roads.
*Grade separated junctions
*Median dividers between opposite-direction traffic to reduce likelihood of head-on collisions
*Removing roadside obstacles.
*Prohibition of more vulnerable road users and slower vehicles.
*Placements of energy attenuation devices (e.g. guard rails, wide grassy areas, sand barrels).
*Eliminating road toll booths

The ends of some guard in rails on high-speed highways in the United States are protected with impact attenuators, designed to gradually absorb the kinetic energy of a vehicle and slow it more gently before it can strike the end of the guard rail head on, which would be devastating at high speed. Several mechanisms are used to dissipate kinetic energy. Fitch Barriers, a system of sand-filled barrels, uses momentum transfer from the vehicle to the sand. Many other systems are tear or deform steel members to absorb energy and gradually stop the vehicle.

In some countries major roads have &quot;tone bands&quot; impressed or cut into the edges of the legal roadway, so that drowsing drivers are awakened by a loud hum as they release the steering and drift off the edge of the road. Tone bands are also referred to as &quot;rumble strips&quot;, owing to the sound they create. An alternative method is the use of &quot;Raised Rib&quot; markings, which consists of a continuous line marking with ribs across the line at regular intervals. They were first specially authorised for use on motorways as an edge line marking to separate the edge of the hard shoulder from the main carriageway. The objective of the marking is to achieve improved visual delineation of the carriageway edge in wet conditions at night. It also provides an audible/vibratory warning to vehicle drivers, should they stray from the carriageway, and run onto the marking.

Better motorways are banked on curves to reduce the need for tire-traction and increase stability for vehicles with high centers of gravity.

The US has developed a prototype automated roadway, to reduce driver fatigue and increase the carrying capacity of the roadway. Roadside units participating in future wireless vehicle safety communications networks have been studied.

Motorways are far more expensive and space-consumptive to build than ordinary roads, so are only used as principal arterial routes. In developed nations, motorways bear a significant portion of motorized travel; for example, the United Kingdom&#x27;s 3533 km of motorways represented less than 1.5% of the United Kingdom&#x27;s roadways in 2003, but carry 23% of road traffic.

The proportion of traffic borne by motorways is a significant safety factor. For example, even though the United Kingdom had a higher fatality rates on both motorways and non-motorways than Finland, both nations shared the same overall fatality rate in 2003. This result was due to the United Kingdom&#x27;s higher proportion of motorway travel.

Similarly, the reduction of conflicts with other vehicles on motorways results in smoother traffic flow, reduced collision rates, and reduced fuel consumption compared with stop-and-go traffic on other roadways.

The improved safety and fuel economy of motorways are common justifications for building more motorways. However, the planned capacity of motorways is often exceeded in a shorter timeframe than initially planned, due to the under estimation of the extent of the suppressed demand for road travel. In developing nations, there is significant public debate on the desirability of continued investment in motorways.

With effect from January 2005 and based primarily on safety grounds, the UK&#x27;s Highways Agency&#x27;s policy is that all new motorway schemes are to use high containment concrete step barriers in the central reserve. All existing motorways will introduce concrete barriers into the central reserve as part of ongoing upgrades and through replacement as and when these systems have reached the end of their useful life. This change of policy applies only to barriers in the central reserve of high speed roads and not to verge side barriers. Other routes will continue to use steel barriers.

More people die on the hard shoulder than on the highway itself. Without other vehicles passing a parked car, following drivers are unaware that the vehicle is parked, despite hazard lights. Truck drivers indicate that they are parked by putting their cab seat behind their truck. In the UK, the AA and police park their vehicles on the hard shoulder at a slight angle so that following drivers can see down the side of their vehicle and are therefore aware that they are stopped.

30% of highway crashes occur in the vicinity of toll collection booths in the countries that have them, these can be reduced by switching to electronic toll systems.

==Vehicle safety==
Safety can be improved in various ways depending on the transport taken.

===Buses and coaches===

Safety can be improved in various simple ways to reduce the chance of a crash occurring. Avoiding rushing or standing in unsafe places on the bus or coach and following the rules on the bus or coach itself will greatly increase the safety of a person travelling by bus or coach. Various safety features can also be implemented into buses and coaches to improve safety including safety bars for people to hold onto.

The main ways to stay safe when travelling by bus or coach are as follows:
* Leave your location early so that you do not have to run to catch the bus or coach.
* At the bus stop, always follow the queue.
* Do not board or alight at a bus stop other than an official one.
* Never board or alight at a red light crossing or unauthorized bus stop.
* Board the bus only after it has come to a halt without rushing in or pushing others.
* Do not sit, stand or travel on the footboard of the bus.
* Do not put any part of your body outside a moving or a stationary bus.
* While in the bus, refrain from shouting or making noise as it can distract the driver.
* Always hold onto the handrail if standing in a moving bus, especially on sharp turns.
* Always adhere to the bus safety rules.

===Cars===
Safety can be improved by reducing the chances of a driver making an error, or by designing vehicles to reduce the severity of crashes that do occur. Most industrialized countries have comprehensive requirements and specifications for safety-related vehicle devices, systems, design, and construction. These may include:
* Passenger restraints such as seat belts – often in conjunction with laws requiring their use – and airbags
* Crash avoidance equipment such as lights and reflectors
* Driver assistance systems such as Electronic Stability Control
* Crash survivability design including fire-retardant interior materials, standards for fuel system integrity, and the use of safety glass
*&quot;Sobriety detectors&quot;: These interlocks prevent the ignition key from working if the driver breathes into one and it detects significant quantities of alcohol. They have been used by some commercial transport companies, or suggested for use with persistent drunk-driving offenders on a voluntary basis

Motorists and passengers – both front and rear – can make dooring less likely by practicing the &quot;Dutch reach&quot; – opening the car door by reaching across the body with the more distant hand.

===Motorbikes===
UK road casualty statistics show that motorcycle riders are nine times more likely to crash, and 17 times more likely to die in a crash, than car drivers. The higher fatality risk is due in part to the lack of crash protection (unlike in enclosed vehicles such as cars), combined with the high speeds motorcycles typically travel at. According to US statistics, the percentage of intoxicated motorcyclists in fatal crashes is higher than other riders on roads. Helmets also play a major role in the safety of motorcyclists. In 2008, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimated the helmets are 37 percent effective in saving lives of motorcyclists involved in crashes.

===Trucks===
According to the European Commission Transportation Department &quot;it has been estimated that up to 25% of accidents involving trucks can be attributable to inadequate cargo securing&quot;. Improperly-secured cargo can cause severe crashes and lead to loss of cargo, loss of lives, loss of vehicles, and can be a hazard for the environment. One way to stabilize, secure, and protect cargo during transportation on the road is by using dunnage bags, which are placed in the voids among the cargo and are designed to prevent the load from moving during transport.

Together for Safer Roads (TSR) has developed best practices for implementing corporate road safety programs that includes data management and analysis, route mapping, investment and upkeep of fleets, safety policies and training for employees, and first-aid/safety training in case collisions do occur.

===Police===
Hundreds of people are killed each year due to high-speed chases of fleeing suspects by police. Different jurisdictions allow such pursuits in different circumstances; fewer injuries might occur if these are restricted to violent felonies.

==Regulation of road users==
Various types of road user regulations are in force or have been tried in most jurisdictions around the world, some these are discussed by road user type below.

===Motor vehicle users===
Dependent on jurisdiction, driver&#x27;s age, road type and vehicle type, motor vehicle drivers may be required to pass a driving test (public transport and goods vehicle drivers may need additional training and licensing), conform to restrictions on driving after consuming alcohol or various drugs, comply with restrictions on use of mobile phones, be covered by compulsory insurance, wear seat belts and comply with certain speed limits. Motorcycle riders may additionally be compelled to wear a motorcycle helmet. Drivers of certain vehicle types may be subject to maximum driving hour regulations.

Some jurisdictions, such as the US states Virginia and Maryland, have implemented specific regulations such as the prohibiting mobile phone use by, and limiting the number of passengers accompanying, young and inexperienced drivers. &quot;The State of Safety Report&quot; from the National Safety Council released in 2017 ranks states on these road safety regulations. It has been noticed that more serious collisions occur at night, when vehicles are more likely to have multiple occupants, and when seat belts are less likely to be used.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety proposes restrictions for new drivers, including a &quot;curfew&quot; imposed on young drivers to prevent them driving at night, an experienced supervisor to chaperone the less experienced driver, forbidding the carrying of passengers, zero alcohol tolerance, raising the standards required for driving instructors and improving the driving test, vehicle restrictions (e.g. restricting access to &#x27;high-performance&#x27; vehicles), a sign placed on the back of the vehicle (an N- or P-Plate) to notify other drivers of a novice driver and encouraging good behaviour in the post-test period.

While government has primary responsibility for providing safe roads, the challenges of development and equity require that all segments of society engage and contribute, including the private sector. Private and public sector coalitions, like Together for Safer Roads (TSR) and the Road to Zero Coalition exist to work alongside government policies to advance the business case of having safer roads; they help companies meet their duty of care to employees and minimize fleet-related dangers to the wider community. Safer roads also benefit business by improving employee health and safety, by protecting assets, reducing productivity losses and healthcare costs, and enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chains.

Some countries or states have already implemented some of these ideas through Vision Zero networks. Pay-as-you-drive adjusts insurance costs according to when and where the person drives.

===Pedal bicycle users===
Dependent on jurisdiction, road type and age, pedal cyclists may be required conform to restrictions on driving after consuming alcohol or various drugs, comply with restrictions on use of 
mobile phones, be covered by compulsory insurance, wear a bicycle helmet and comply with certain speed limits.

===Pedestrians===
Dependent on jurisdiction, jaywalking may be prohibited. The frequent road safety education for the children helps to improve the dangerous behaviors.

===Animals===

Collisions with animals are usually fatal to the animals, and occasionally to drivers as well.

==Information campaigns==

Information campaigns can be used to raise awareness of initiatives designed to reduce road casualty levels. Examples include:
* Think! encouraging use of seatbelts (UK 2000–present)
* &quot; Decade of Action&quot; by World Health Organization and Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (2011–2020)
* Traffic awareness campaigns such as the &quot;one false move&quot; campaign documented by Hillman et al.
* &quot;Speeding. No one thinks big of you.&quot; (New South Wales, Australia, 2007)
* &quot;Road Safety is no Accident&quot; World Health Organization
* &quot;Designated driver campaign&quot;, (US, 1970s–present)
* &quot;Click It or Ticket&quot;, (US, 1993–present)
* &quot;Clunk Click Every Trip&quot; (UK 1971)
* &quot;Green Cross Code&quot; (UK 1970–present)

==Statistics==


===Rating roads for safety===
Since 1999 the EuroRAP initiative has been assessing major roads in Europe with a road protection score. This results in a star rating for roads based on how well its design would protect car occupants from being severely injured or killed if a head-on, run-off, or intersection crash occurs, with 4 stars representing a road with the best survivability features. The scheme states it has highlighted thousands of road sections across Europe where road-users are routinely maimed and killed for want of safety features, sometimes for little more than the cost of safety fencing or the paint required to improve road markings.

There are plans to extend the measurements to rate the probability of a collision for the road. These ratings are being used to inform planning and authorities&#x27; targets. For example, in Britain two-thirds of all road deaths happen on rural roads, which score badly when compared to the high quality motorway network; single carriageways claim 80% of rural deaths and serious injuries, while 40% of rural car occupant casualties are in cars that hit roadside objects, such as trees. Improvements in driver training and safety features for rural roads are hoped to reduce this statistic.

The number of designated traffic officers in the UK fell from 15% to 20% of police force strength
in 1966 to seven per cent of force strength in 1998, and between 1999 and 2004 by 21%. It is an item of debate whether the reduction in traffic collisions per 100 million miles driven over this time has been due to robotic enforcement.

In the United States, roads are not government-rated, for media-releases and public knowledge on their actual safety features. [unclear] However, in 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x27;s &quot;Traffic Safety Facts&quot; found that over 800 persons were killed across the US by &quot;non-fixed objects&quot; that includes roadway debris. California had the highest number of total deaths from those crashes; New Mexico had a best chance for an individual to die from experiencing any vehicle-debris crash.

===KSI statistics===
According to WHO in 2010 it was estimated that 1.24 million people were killed worldwide and 50 million more were injured in motor vehicle collisions. Young adults aged between 15 and 44 years account for 59% of global road traffic deaths. Other key facts according to the WHO report are:

*Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among young people, aged 15–29 years.
*91% of the world&#x27;s fatalities on the roads occur in low-income and middle-income countries, even though these countries have approximately half of the world&#x27;s vehicles.
*Half of those dying on the world&#x27;s roads are &quot;vulnerable road users&quot;: pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists.
*Without action, road traffic crashes are predicted to result in the deaths of around 1.9 million people annually by 2020.
*Only 28 countries, representing 416 million people (7% of the world&#x27;s population), have adequate laws that address all five risk factors (speed, drunk-driving, helmets, seat-belts and child restraints).

It is estimated that motor vehicle collisions caused the death of around 60 million people during the 20th century, around the same number of World War II casualties.

As the comparatively poor improvements in pedestrian safety have become a concern at OECD level, the &quot;Joint Transport Research Centre of OECD and the International Transport Forum&quot; (JTRC) convened an international expert group and published a report entitled &quot;”Pedestrian Safety, Urban Space and Health in 2012”&quot;.

According to BITRE/Australia agency changes in growth in population, vehicle registration, and estimated vehicle kilometres travelled have various impact on death trend from OECD countries.

In some countries, the safety is computed mixing two metrics: the fatalities and the traveled distance, to establish fatalities by traveled distance.


According to the BITRE, traveled distance has a limited impact on death trend from OECD countries.

== Road traffic safety professional societies ==
Institute of Transportation Engineers: An international educational and scientific association of transportation professionals who are responsible for meeting mobility and safety needs.

National Association of City Transportation Officials

International Municipal Signal Association: A traffic standard organization.

== Road traffic safety guide and reference manuals ==

=== Signalized Intersections Informational Guide ===
Published by the Federal Highway Association of the U.S. Department of Transportation.

== Advocacy groups ==
The Automobile Association was established in 1905 in the United Kingdom to help motorists avoid police speed traps. They became involved in other safety issues and also erected thousands of roadside warning signs.

The Pedestrians Association (now known as Living Streets) in the United Kingdom was formed in 1929 to press for better road safety. Other groups have been active in other countries.

The International Road Federation has an issue area and working group dedicated to road safety. They work with their membership to advocate measures that improve road safety through infrastructure and cooperation with other international organizations.

Motoring advocacy groups including the Association of British Drivers (UK), Speed cameras.org (UK), National Motorists Association (US/Canada) argue that the strict enforcement of speed limits does not necessarily result in safer driving, and may even have negative effect on road safety in general. Safe Speed was a UK group set up specifically to campaign against the use of Speed cameras.

Together for Safer Roads (TSR) is a coalition that brings together global private sector companies, across industries, to collaborate on improving road safety. TSR brings together members&#x27; knowledge, data, technology, and global networks to focus on five road safety areas with the goal of bringing about the greatest impact globally and within local communities.

In 1965, Ralph Nader put pressure on car manufacturers in his book &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;, detailing resistance by car manufacturers to the introduction of safety features such as seat belts, and their general reluctance to spend money on improving safety. The GM President James Roche was later forced to appear before a United States Senate subcommittee, and to apologize to Nader for the company&#x27;s campaign of harassment and intimidation. Nader later successfully sued GM for excessive invasion of privacy.

RoadPeace was formed in 1991 in the United Kingdom to advocate for better road safety and founded World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims in 1993 which received support from the United Nations General Assembly in 2005.

<text>Richard Clare Danko (December 29, 1943 – December 10, 1999) was a Canadian musician, bassist, songwriter, and singer, best known as a founding member of the Band, for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

During the 1960s, Danko performed as a member of the Hawks, backing Ronnie Hawkins and then Bob Dylan. Then, between 1968 and 1977, Danko and the Hawks, now called the Band, released seven studio albums before breaking up. Beginning with the group&#x27;s reformation in 1983 and up until his death, Danko participated in the Band&#x27;s partial reunion.

==Biography==
===Early years (1943–1960)===
Danko was born on December 29, 1943 in Blayney, Ontario, a farming community outside the town of Simcoe, the third of four sons in a musical family of Ukrainian descent. He grew up listening to live music at family gatherings and to country music, blues and R&amp;B on the radio. He especially liked country music, and often his mother would let him stay up late to listen to the Grand Ole Opry on the radio.

His musical influences included Hank Williams, the Carter Family and, later, Sam Cooke. He also drew inspiration from the music of his eldest brother, Junior. Danko&#x27;s second-eldest brother, Dennis, was an accomplished songwriter, and his younger brother, Terry, also became a musician.

He made his musical debut playing a four-string tenor banjo and guitar for his first-grade classmates, and while various sources differ slightly, all suggest he was headed to a professional career early. One report has him forming as lead guitarist his first &quot;Rick Danko Band&quot; at age 12 or 13, another reference mentions that by age 14 he was putting on country &amp; western shows with his brothers, Maurice Jr., Dennis and Terry, using various group names. It is also written that he started a band at that age with his eldest brother, Maurice Junior and a local high school teacher on drums. This trio performed country music and R &amp; B at local dance halls, sometimes rented themselves, weddings, and other events. The group, &quot;The Starlights&quot;, expanded to included accordion, second guitar and &quot;a girl singer&quot;, expanded their repertoire to include polkas for newer European immigrants.

By age 17, already a five-year music veteran and having already left the Simcoe Composite School and working by day as a butcher, Danko booked his band The Starlights as the opening act for Ronnie Hawkins.

===The Hawks (1960–1964)===
Hawkins invited Danko to join the Hawks as rhythm guitarist. Around this time, Hawks bassist Rebel Paine was fired by Hawkins, who, wasting no time, ordered Danko to learn to play the bass with help from other members in the band. By September 1960, he was Hawkins&#x27;s bassist.

In 1961, Danko with drummer Levon Helm backed guitarist Lenny Breau on several tracks recorded at Hallmark Studios in Toronto. These tracks are included on the 2003 release The Hallmark Sessions.

Soon joined by pianist Richard Manuel and multi-instrumentalist Garth Hudson, the Hawks played with Hawkins through mid-1963. An altercation that year between Danko and Hawkins led Danko, Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson, Manuel, and Hudson to give two-weeks&#x27; notice in early 1964, and they parted ways with Hawkins on reasonably amicable terms. The group had been planning to break with Hawkins and continue together as a band without a frontman, as a team of equal members.

===Pre-Band (1964–1968)===
Danko and the former Hawks initially performed as the Levon Helm Sextet with saxophonist Jerry Penfound. After Penfound left, they changed their name to The Canadian Squires, and finally to Levon and the Hawks. Playing a circuit that stretched geographically from Ontario to Arkansas, they became known as &quot;the best damn bar band in the land.&quot;

In August 1965, Mary Martin, an assistant to Bob Dylan&#x27;s manager Albert Grossman, heard Levon and the Hawks perform. Grossman introduced the band&#x27;s music to Dylan, who was impressed. The band was performing at Tony Mart&#x27;s, a popular club in Somers Point, New Jersey, and Grossman&#x27;s office called the club to speak with Levon and the group about touring with Dylan.

Helm was not happy to be backing a &quot;strummer&quot; but reluctantly agreed, and the band became Dylan&#x27;s backup group for a tour beginning in September. The tour, however, became too much for Helm, who departed in November. Through May 1966, Dylan and the remaining foursome (together with pick-up drummers, including the actor and musician Mickey Jones) traveled across the U.S., Australia, and Europe. After the final shows in Britain, Dylan retreated to his new home in Woodstock, New York, and the Hawks joined him there shortly thereafter.

===The Band (1968–1977)===

It was Danko who found the pink house on Parnassus Lane in Saugerties, New York, which became known as Big Pink. Danko, Hudson, and Manuel moved in, and Robertson lived nearby. The Band&#x27;s musical sessions with Dylan took place in the basement of Big Pink, between June and October 1967, generating recordings that were officially released in 1975 as &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;. In October, the Hawks began demo recordings for their first album, with Helm rejoining the group in that month. Their manager, Albert Grossman, secured them a recording deal with Capitol Records in late 1967.

From January to March 1968, the Band recorded their debut album, &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;, in recording studios in New York and Los Angeles. On this album, Danko sang lead vocal on three songs: &quot;Caledonia Mission&quot;, &quot;Long Black Veil&quot; and &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire.&quot;

Before the Band could promote the album by touring, Danko was severely injured in a car accident, breaking his neck and back in six places, which put him in traction for months. While he was in traction, Danko&#x27;s girlfriend, Grace Seldner, informed him that she was pregnant, and he proposed from his hospital bed. When they married at the Church of the Holy Transfiguration of Christ-on-the-Mount in Woodstock, Danko was still in a neck brace. Rick and Grace divorced in October 1980.

The Band finally made their concert debut at Bill Graham&#x27;s Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco in April 1969. By this time, they were already hard at work on their eponymous second album. On that record, sometimes known as the Brown Album, Danko sang what would become two of his signature songs—and two of the group&#x27;s best-loved classics: &quot;When You Awake&quot; and &quot;Unfaithful Servant.&quot; Both songs exemplified Danko&#x27;s talents as a lead singer and demonstrated his naturally plaintive voice.

Danko is featured in the documentary film &quot;Festival Express&quot;, about an all-star tour by train across Canada in 1970. On the train, he sings an impromptu version of &quot;Ain&#x27;t No More Cane&quot; with Jerry Garcia and Janis Joplin.

In an interview published in &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, Danko cited bassists James Jamerson, Ron Carter, Edgar Willis, and Chuck Rainey as his musical influences. He eventually moved from the Fender Jazz Bass to an Ampeg fretless model and later a Gibson Ripper for &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;.

===Later years (1977–1999)===

After the Band performed its farewell concert (&quot;The Last Waltz&quot;) at Winterland in November 1976, Danko was offered a contract with Arista Records by Clive Davis, making him the first Band member to record a solo album. Issued in 1977, his self-titled début featured each of his former bandmates in addition to Ronnie Wood, Eric Clapton, Doug Sahm, Blondie Chaplin, and Danko&#x27;s brother, Terry. The album was primarily recorded at the Band&#x27;s California studio, Shangri-La. The poor sales of the album destined it for rarity status. After he recorded an unreleased follow-up album, Danko was dropped from Arista. The follow-up album was finally released as a part of &quot;Cryin&#x27; Heart Blues&quot; in 2005.

In early 1979 Danko opened shows for Boz Scaggs. Also in 1979, Danko and Paul Butterfield toured together as the Danko/Butterfield Band. Among the songs they covered was &quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot;, originally recorded by the Beach Boys, with Blondie Chaplin, who toured with Danko/Butterfield, on guitar and vocals. From 1983 to 1999, Danko alternated between a reformed version of the Band featuring Helm, Hudson, and guitarist Jim Weider (and, from 1983 to 1986, Manuel); a solo career; and collaborations including award-winning work with singer-songwriter Eric Andersen and Norway&#x27;s Jonas Fjeld as Danko/Fjeld/Andersen.

In 1984, Danko joined members of the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers and others in a touring company called &quot;The Byrds Twenty-Year Celebration.&quot; Several members of this band performed solo songs to start the show including Danko, who performed &quot;Mystery Train&quot;. In 1989, he toured with Levon Helm and Garth Hudson as part of Ringo Starr&#x27;s first All-Starr Band. On July 21, 1990, in Roger Waters&#x27;s stage production of &quot;The Wall Concert in Berlin, &quot;Danko sang on the Pink Floyd songs &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and &quot;Mother&quot;, the former with Van Morrison, Roger Waters, and Levon Helm, and the latter with Helm and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. He recorded demos and made a number of appearances on albums by other artists throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and, in 1997, released &quot;Rick Danko in Concert&quot;. Two years later, a third solo album (&quot;Live on Breeze Hill&quot;) was released, and Danko was at work on a fourth (&quot;Times Like These&quot;) at the time of his death.

In the meantime, the Band (without Robbie Robertson and Richard Manuel) recorded three more albums, and Danko teamed with Fjeld and Andersen for two trio albums, &quot;Danko/Fjeld/Andersen&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Ridin&#x27; on the Blinds&quot; in 1994.

In 1994, Danko was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Band.

Danko struggled with heroin addiction. On May 6, 1997, he was arrested in Japan for drug smuggling after his wife sent him heroin. Danko pleaded not guilty, but acknowledged having used heroin and stated that he would seek help if he were allowed to return to the United States. After spending ten and a half weeks in prison, Danko was released and given a suspended sentence.

==Death==
On December 10, 1999, days after the end of a brief tour of the Midwest that included two shows in the Chicago area and a final gig at the Ark in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Danko died of heart failure in his sleep at his home in Marbletown, New York. He was 55.

He was survived by his second wife, Elizabeth (died 2013), whom he had married in 1989, a stepson, Justin, and a daughter, Lisa, from his first marriage. His son Eli, from Danko&#x27;s first marriage, died in 1989, at age 18, from asphyxiation after heavy drinking while attending the State University of New York at Albany. Danko was buried next to Eli at Woodstock Cemetery, Woodstock, New York.

==Legacy==
For the April 2012 edition of &quot;Bass Musician: Bass Magazine for Bass Players and the Bass Industry&quot;, Rob Collier wrote an article titled &quot;How to Danko: A Lesson in the Style of Rick Danko&quot;.

In the Irish Times, Laurence Mackin wrote:Together with bass player Rick Danko, [Levon] Helm formed one of the finest rhythm sections to ever put a groove to a beat, and a partnership that formed the backbone of the Band. In Danko, he had the perfect complementary player, one of the finest bassists and one of the gentlest souls. His music was subtle, his instinct for just the right note unwavering – he could play one beat in four bars, but lord could he make it count. Their subtle, intense rhythmic conversation brought shape and distinction to the Band&#x27;s music – it gave it heart and soul.

The Drive-By Truckers&#x27; song &quot;Danko/Manuel,&quot; written by Jason Isbell, was released on their album &quot;The Dirty South&quot; in 2004. Steve Forbert released &quot;Wild as the Wind (A Tribute to Rick Danko)&quot; on &quot;Just Like There&#x27;s Nothin&#x27; To It&quot; in 2004. Martin Hagfors honored Danko on the Home Groan song &quot;You Made a Difference&quot; in 2000.

A number of musical artists have cited Danko as an influence, including Elvis Costello, John Doe, Mumford &amp; Sons, Lucinda Williams, Jay Farrar, Neko Case, Robbie Fulks, Cindy Cashdollar, Craig Finn of The Hold Steady, Chris Tomson of Vampire Weekend, Mike Watt, and Eric Clapton who said &quot;Rick&#x27;s singing has had a tremendous influence on me ... you have to be a great musician before you can sing like that.&quot;
==Notable instruments==
Danko used various basses throughout his career. He played a mid-sixties sunburst Fender Jazz Bass on the 1966 World Tour with Bob Dylan, and on the recording of &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; and &quot;The Band&quot;, as well as early live shows by the Band, including Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival. In late 1969, the Band was given some equipment by Ampeg, which included a fretted Ampeg AEB, a fretless Ampeg AMUB and an Ampeg &quot;Baby Bass&quot;, a fiberglass-made electric upright bass. The fretless AMUB, modified with a Precision Bass pickup (see picture above, of Danko performing with the Band in Hamburg, 1971), was his bass of choice for the next years to come, and can be heard prominently on &quot;Stage Fright&quot; and &quot;Cahoots&quot;, and was used live, as can be seen in the film Festival Express also in video footage included in the &quot;Live at the Academy of Music 1971&quot; release. This fretless bass was sold on eBay from a private collection in early 2012 for US$35,000.00. He was also seen performing with Fender Precision Basses and he also owned four Gibson Rippers, and would change out the pickups to experiment with different tones. Photos and video show him often playing a blonde one and also a sunburst, which was featured in &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;.

Throughout the 1990s, Danko played a custom-built hollow-body electric bass by luthier Mark Dan, with Alembic pickups, which he referred to as &quot;One of the greatest basses that I&#x27;ve ever had&quot;. His other main bass throughout the 1990s was a red electric hollowbody bass from the Norwegian Workshop Guitar Company with two types of Alembic Pickups.
His amp of choice was a blueline Ampeg SVT, and he also used a 1959 Fender Bassman.

<text>Hedonism II is an adults-only vacation resort in Jamaica, owned and operated by Marshmallow Ltd, headed by Harry Lange. The resort has areas reserved for naturism and it is known for its sexually liberal culture. , only Hedonism II is in operation. There was never a Hedonism I, and Hedonism III closed in 2010.

== History ==
Hedonism II opened in 1976 as &quot;Negril Beach Village&quot; and was renamed in 1981. It was built by the Government of Jamaica at a cost of $10 million. It occupies at the northern end of Negril beach and has 280 rooms in two-story buildings. A 50% interest in the hotel was bought by the SuperClubs in 1989, a resort company owned by John Issa &amp; his family, for $12.25 million. On February 26, 2013, the resort was sold to Marshmallow Ltd headed by Harry Lange with a minority stock held by the Issa family and Kevin Levee, a 28-year employee of SuperClubs and its current general manager. Harry W. Lange&#x27;s company is now named PB&amp;J Resorts II (Jamaica) Limited.

Hedonism III opened in 1999 in Runaway Bay and was built on and contained 225 rooms in 3-story buildings; in August 2010 the company closed Hedonism III temporarily, to allow for remodeling work. It reopened on October 14, 2010, as SuperFun Beach Resort and Spa catering to a wider market through additional tour operators. However, SuperFun Beach Resort entered receivership in March 2011 and closed in June 2011. While it was an adult-only resort, SuperFun did not allow topless or nude sunbathing. The property was leased to SuperClubs by the Development Bank of Jamaica, while the hotel&#x27;s first-ranked secured lenders were Caribbean Development Bank, PanCaribbean, and Development Bank of Jamaica.

In July 2020, a cannabis dispensary Hedo Weedo was opened inside the resort as the first legal and regulated cannabis dispensary in Jamaica.

Hedonism II often receives bookings from tour companies, who cater to swingers.

==Controversies==

Public nudity is illegal in Jamaica, but the laws are not enforced and may not apply inside the private resort. A nude wedding of eight couples in 2001 at Hedonism III caused protests by the government tourist office and radio talk show hosts, who called the event &quot;improper and offensive.&quot; In February 2003, 29 couples were involved in another round of nude weddings at the Hedonism III; Hedonism resorts host nudist and swingers conventions: it has been alleged that open sex is common, including in the hot tubs at night. SuperClubs owner John Issa said he was not aware of this.

Issa also said he was not running a &quot;whorehouse&quot; and that, to his knowledge, &quot;whores are not working&quot; in his Hedonism hotels. Issa sued two employees of Unique Vacations in Miami, Florida, over e-mails sent in 2007 and 2008 which he said contained &quot;defamatory statements&quot; about activities at Hedonism Resorts and sought damages of an unspecified amount for what he said were false and malicious statements.

Issa said he feels satisfied with Hedonism&#x27;s image of &quot;decadence and debauchery&quot; and is satisfied with the idea, expressed on his website, that &quot;When it&#x27;s good it&#x27;s oh so good and when it&#x27;s bad it&#x27;s even better and yes, everything you ever heard is true&quot;. Issa allegedly promoted bisexual activities at Hedonism III.

In September 2009, Hedonism Resorts lost a WIPO trial against Relevansanalys related to the registration of the Internet domain name &#x27;hedonismhotels.com&#x27;.

==In popular culture==
*A travel/humor book about the resort, titled &quot;The Naked Truth About Hedonism II: A totally unauthorized naughty, but nice guide to Jamaica&#x27;s very adult resort&quot; by Chris Santilli, was released in its 3rd edition in December 2019.
*In the &quot;Dwight&#x27;s Speech&quot; episode of &quot;The Office&quot;, Kevin Malone suggests that Jim Halpert go to Hedonism for a vacation. He describes it as &quot;like Club Med, but everything is naked&quot;.
*In 2010, comedian Daniel Tosh of &quot;Tosh.0&quot; lampooned the antics of &quot;Hedo Rick&quot; in a viral video that featured an aging patron of Hedonism II parading in a speedo and promoting the wild women and sexual nature of the resort.
*In season 2, episode 10 of the show &quot;Workaholics&quot;, the main characters scramble to have a fake passport made for Blake in an effort to spend their Thanksgiving at Hedonism II.
*Hedonism has appeared several times since 2014 in &quot;Naked News&quot;.
*There are two movies about Hedo - Hangin in Hedo Hangin in Hedo (2008) starring Sherman Hemsley . and The Swing of Things (2020) with an all star cast. The Swing of Things was filmed at the all inclusive adults only resort. 
*News Anchor Tamron Hall has mentioned her experiences at Hedonism II in several interviews, stating that she loved the naked waterslide, and that seeing a naked man at the snack bar made her double think her vacation choice.

<doc id="354695" wikidata="Q706406" url="?curid=354695" title="Ron Ziegler">
<text>Ronald Louis Ziegler (May 12, 1939 – February 10, 2003) was the 13th White House Press Secretary, serving during President Richard Nixon&#x27;s administration.

==Early life==
Ziegler was born to Louis Daniel Ziegler, a production manager, and Ruby (Parsons) in Covington, Kentucky. He was raised in the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod denomination.

Ziegler attended Concordia Lutheran School and graduated from the eighth grade in 1953. He graduated from Dixie Heights High School in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. He first attended college at Xavier University in Cincinnati, then transferred to the University of Southern California in 1958, graduating in 1961 with a degree in government and politics. While at USC, Ziegler was initiated into the Sigma Chi fraternity. At University of Southern California, he was a member of Trojans for Representative Government with future Watergate scandal participants Dwight L. Chapin, Tim Elbourne, Donald Segretti, Gordon C. Strachan, and Herbert Porter.

==Career==
===Early work===
Ziegler served as a press aide on Nixon&#x27;s unsuccessful California gubernatorial campaign in 1962. He then worked with H. R. Haldeman, who later served as Nixon&#x27;s White House Chief of Staff, at the J. Walter Thompson advertising firm.

===Nixon administration===
In 1969, at the age of 29, Ziegler became the youngest White House Press Secretary in history, serving in the Nixon Administration. He was also the first press secretary to use the White House Press Briefing Room when it was completed in 1970. Historically, White House press secretaries had been recruited from the ranks of individuals with substantial journalistic experience, such as Stephen Early and Pierre Salinger, raising the question of whether Ziegler was qualified for his position. The hiring of Ziegler was seen by many, and later confirmed by Haldeman himself, as a cog in Nixon&#x27;s plan to undermine the press; Ziegler&#x27;s ability to execute the chief of staff&#x27;s directions was impressive, allowing him to hold a senior position throughout the administration. Ziegler held the record for the youngest White House press secretary until 2025, when Karoline Leavitt, aged 27, became Press Secretary at the beginning of the Second presidency of Donald Trump.

Ziegler was the White House press secretary during the political scandal known as Watergate. In 1972, he dismissed the first report of the burglary at the Watergate Hotel as a &quot;third-rate burglary attempt&quot;, and repeatedly dismissed reports by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, but within two years, Nixon had resigned under threat of impeachment. Ziegler apologized to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for having been so dismissive.

At a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention on August 20, 1973, Nixon was filmed angrily pushing Ziegler toward a crowd of reporters. The president was incensed that Ziegler was not doing enough to keep members of the press away as Nixon entered the convention hall.

In 1974, Ziegler became Assistant to the President. Particularly in the period following the resignations of such senior administration officials as Bob Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, Ziegler became one of Nixon&#x27;s closest aides and confidants. During the impeachment process against Nixon, he defended the president until the bitter end, urging Nixon not to resign, but rather fight conviction and removal from office in the Senate. During the unfolding political scandal, Ziegler appeared before Congress at least 33 times.

==Post-Watergate==
Unlike many other former aides following President Nixon&#x27;s resignation in 1974, Ziegler remained very close to him. Ziegler was on the plane that Nixon took to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, near San Clemente, California, as Gerald Ford was sworn into office.

On November 12, 1999, Ziegler was scheduled to participate by telephone in a television panel discussion that included several former Nixon and Ford aides, including his successor as White House Press Secretary, Jerald terHorst, who had resigned in protest at President Ford&#x27;s pardon of Nixon. However, Ziegler&#x27;s feed failed to hook up for the session, which went on without him.

===Business activities and achievements===

In 1988, Ziegler became president and chief executive of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, living in Alexandria, Virginia. He had previously served as president of the National Association of Truck Stop Operators. He was described by leading truck stop advocate William Fay as &quot;a significant factor in expanding the travel plaza and truckstop industry&#x27;s presence in the nation&#x27;s capital.&quot; Hay further credited Ziegler as having achieved &quot;great strides in membership recruitment and expansion of member services.&quot;

==Personal life==

<doc id="354706" wikidata="Q3892747" url="?curid=354706" title="Palmair">
<text>Palmair European was a British tour operator with its head office in the Space House in Bournemouth, United Kingdom. Palmair offered charter and scheduled flights on behalf of Bath Travel. Its main base was Bournemouth Airport. Palmair have now stopped any flights for the foreseeable future and the airline has been placed into a &quot;deep freeze&quot; until the economic climate improves.

The company holds a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Air Travel Organiser&#x27;s Licence (ATOL0003).

== History ==

The first Palmair charter took place in 1958 with a single flight to Palma followed a year later with just 2 flights. Over the following years the number of flights increased and expanded to a range of destinations, chartering aircraft from a number of different airlines.

In 1993 the company formed its own airline, Palmair Flightline, operating a BAe 146 aircraft. Upgraded aircraft were acquired in 1999 to reflect increased demand for capacity from Bournemouth and for the introduction of longer range routes. Until winter 1999 services was operated by Flightline, using a single BAe 146–300. In 2003 Palmair carried 75,000 passengers. In 2004 the company operated scheduled passenger flights to ten European airports, and day trips to 25 European cities.

On 22 December 2006, founder, Peter Bath, who had previously seen off every flight personally, died, aged 79.

In November 2008, European Aviation, which had been operating a Boeing 737-200 for Palmair, ceased trading meaning that the Boeing 737-200 was grounded.

For winter 2008/2009, Palmair flights were operated by Jet2.com using a Boeing 737-300.

On 9 May 2009, Palmair resumed flights with a Boeing 737-500 aircraft operated by Astraeus.
The airline continued using the plane until October 2010 when it left Bournemouth Airport for the last time.
The original agreement between Palmair and Astraeus was for Palmair to use the plane up until April 2012, but due to unforeseen circumstances it had to be handed back to Astraeus.

As a result, during the Winter and Summer of 2010, Thomson Airways operated Palmair&#x27;s routes to Lanzarote and Tenerife (these were their only destinations at the time).
Thomson continued to operate these routes until April 2011 when Palmair finally pulled the plug.
Given the current climate Palmair has been forced to cease its entire operations starting from Summer 2011.
Bosses stated that they won&#x27;t be issuing any new schedules for the airline in the foreseeable future and that Palmair would be placed in a deep freeze, at least until the climate improves.

The contributing factors to the downfall of Palmair was said to have been increasing competition from various low cost airlines using Bournemouth airport, rising fuel prices and the recession.

Previous managing director David Skillicorn was featured in an interview with local newspaper &quot;The Daily Echo&quot; in which he talked about his time while working at the company before leaving, in which his famous final words were &quot;Never say never&quot;.

==Awards==

===2003===

The UK consumer magazine &quot;Holiday Which?&quot; published the results of a survey of 20,000 UK air passengers, showing that Palmair was the top rated airline flying from the UK.

===2008===

Palmair was mentioned on BBC World&#x27;s &quot;Fast Track&quot; on 26 June 2008, as one of the top four airlines in the world in the British &quot;Which?&quot; magazine consumer survey. In the short haul airline category Palmair was picked as the best. Palmair tied with Air New Zealand for third in the 70,000 consumer opinion responses comparing 70 worldwide airlines.

David Skillicorn, managing director of Palmair, said he was delighted. He said, &quot;We are just little Palmair with a little Boeing 737 yet we beat the likes of Virgin Atlantic and British Airways. Singapore Airlines has 100 planes including the A380 which is the largest plane in service, on-board massages and a choice of DVDs. All we can offer is the choice of tea or coffee – that is why I feel so flattered. Coming joint third in this poll is such an amazing achievement.&quot;

==Livery==

With the airline beginning their own scheduled service operated by an Astraeus Boeing 737-500, the airline revealed a new livery at a ceremony in a hangar at Bournemouth Airport. Over 300 people turned up to the unveiling of the new livery and aircraft that has been named &quot;The Spirit of Peter Bath&quot; (the founder of Palmair). The new livery features larger tiles across the fuselage saying &#x27;PALMAIR&#x27; and on the tail, the Union Flag and the airlines new website tiles, &#x27;flypalmair.co.uk&#x27;.

==Fleet==
A Boeing 737-500 operated in Palmair livery was returned to the leasing company (Astraeus Airlines).

<text>George Pérez (; June 9, 1954 – May 6, 2022) was an American comic book artist and writer, who worked primarily as a penciller. He came to prominence in the 1970s penciling &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot; for Marvel Comics. In the 1980s, he penciled &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;, which became one of DC Comics&#x27; top-selling series. He penciled DC&#x27;s landmark limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, followed by relaunching &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; as both writer and penciller for the rebooted series. In the meantime, he worked on other comics published by Marvel, DC, and other companies into the 2010s. He was known for his detailed and realistic rendering, and his facility with complex crowd scenes.

Among the many characters Pérez created or co-created are Cyborg, Raven, Starfire, Deathstroke, and the Nightwing identity of Dick Grayson.

==Early life==
George Pérez was born on June 9, 1954, in the South Bronx, New York City, to Jorge Guzman Pérez and Luz Maria Izquierdo, who were both from Caguas, Puerto Rico, but met after settling in New Jersey while searching for job opportunities. They married in October 1954 and subsequently moved to New York, where Jorge worked in the meat packing industry while Luz was a homemaker. George&#x27;s younger brother David was born in May 1955. Both brothers aspired at a young age to be artists, with George beginning to draw at the age of five.

==Career==
===Early career===
Pérez&#x27;s first involvement with the professional comics industry was as artist Rich Buckler&#x27;s assistant in 1973, and he made his professional debut in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #25 (Aug. 1974) as penciler of an untitled two-page satire of Buckler&#x27;s character Deathlok, star of that comic&#x27;s main feature. Soon Pérez became a Marvel regular, penciling a run of &quot;Sons of the Tiger&quot;, a serialized action-adventure strip published in Marvel&#x27;s long-running &quot;Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot; magazine and authored by Bill Mantlo. He and Mantlo co-created the White Tiger (comics&#x27; first Puerto Rican superhero), a character that soon appeared in Marvel&#x27;s color comics, most notably the Spider-Man titles.

Pérez came to prominence with Marvel&#x27;s superhero-team comic &quot;The Avengers&quot;, starting with issue #141. In the 1970s, Pérez illustrated several other Marvel titles, including &quot;Creatures on the Loose&quot;, featuring the Man-Wolf; &quot;The Inhumans&quot;; and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. Writer Roy Thomas and Pérez crafted a metafictional story for &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #176 (Nov. 1976) in which the Impossible Man visited the offices of Marvel Comics and met numerous comics creators. While most of Pérez&#x27; &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; issues were written by Roy Thomas or Len Wein, it would be a &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; where he would have his first major collaboration with writer Marv Wolfman. Pérez drew the first part of writer Jim Shooter&#x27;s &quot;The Korvac Saga&quot;, which featured nearly every Avenger who had joined the team up to that point. Shooter and Pérez introduced the character of Henry Peter Gyrich, the Avengers&#x27; liaison to the United States National Security Council in the second chapter of that same storyline. Writer David Michelinie and Pérez created the Taskmaster in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #195 (May 1980).

===&quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;===
In 1980, while still drawing &quot;The Avengers&quot; for Marvel, Pérez began working for their rival DC Comics. Offered the art chores for the launch of &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;, written by Wolfman, Pérez&#x27;s real incentive was the opportunity to draw &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (an ambition of Pérez&#x27;s that &quot;seemed like a natural progress from the &quot;Avengers&quot;&quot;). Long-time &quot;Justice League&quot; artist Dick Dillin died right around that time, providing an opportunity for Pérez to step in as regular artist. While Pérez&#x27;s stint on the &quot;JLA&quot; was popular with fans, he received greater attention for his work on &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;, which was launched in a special preview in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #26 (October 1980). This incarnation of the Titans was intended to be DC&#x27;s answer to Marvel&#x27;s increasingly popular &quot;X-Men&quot; comic, and it became highly successful. A &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; drug awareness comic book sponsored by the Keebler Company and drawn by Pérez was published in cooperation with The President&#x27;s Drug Awareness Campaign in 1983. In August 1984, a second series of &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; was launched by Wolfman and Pérez. Moreover, Pérez&#x27;s facility with layouts, details, and faces improved enormously during his four years on the book, making him one of the most popular artists in comics as evidenced by the numerous industry awards he would receive during this time. (See Awards section below.)

===&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;===
Pérez took a leave of absence from &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; in 1984 to focus on his next project with Marv Wolfman, DC&#x27;s 1985 50th-anniversary event, &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. &quot;Crisis&quot; purportedly featured every single character DC owned, in a story which radically restructured the DC universe&#x27;s continuity. Pérez was inked on the series by Dick Giordano, Mike DeCarlo, and Jerry Ordway. After &quot;Crisis&quot;, Pérez inked the final issue of &quot;Superman&quot; (issue #423) in September 1986, over Curt Swan&#x27;s pencils, for part one of the two-part story &quot;Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?&quot; by writer Alan Moore. The following month, Pérez was one of the artists on &quot;Batman&quot; #400 (October 1986). Wolfman and Pérez teamed again to produce the &quot;History of the DC Universe&quot; limited series to summarize the revised history of their fictional universe. Pérez drew the cover for the &quot;DC Heroes&quot; roleplaying game (1985) from Mayfair Games as well as the cover for the fourth edition of the &quot;Champions&quot; roleplaying game (1989) from Hero Games.

===&quot;Wonder Woman&quot;===

Pérez played a key role in the 1987 reboot of the Wonder Woman franchise. Writer Greg Potter spent several months working with editor Janice Race on new concepts for the character, before being joined by Pérez. Inspired by John Byrne and Frank Miller&#x27;s work on refashioning Superman and Batman, Pérez came in as the plotter and penciler of the series, which tied the character more closely to the Greek gods and jettisoned many other elements of her history. Pérez at first worked with Potter and Len Wein on the stories, but eventually took over the full scripting chores. Later, Mindy Newell joined Pérez as co-writer for nearly a year. While not as popular as either &quot;Titans&quot; or &quot;Crisis&quot;, the series was a very successful relaunch of one of DC&#x27;s flagship characters. Pérez would work on the title for five years, leaving as artist after issue #24, but remaining as writer up to issue #62, leaving in 1992. Pérez returned to the character in 2001, co-writing a two-part story in issues #168–169 with writer/artist Phil Jimenez. Pérez also drew the cover for &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #600 (Aug. 2010) as well as some interior art. For the successful 2017 &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; feature film, director Patty Jenkins would credit Pérez&#x27;s work on the title character as a major influence, on par with the work of the original creator, William Moulton Marston.

===&quot;The New Titans&quot;===
Pérez returned as co-plotter/penciller of &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; with issue #50 (Dec. 1988), with the series being renamed &quot;The New Titans&quot;, rewriting the origin of Wonder Girl, following the retcons in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. Pérez remained as penciller with the book through to issue #55, 57, and 60, while only providing layouts for issues 58–59, and 61, with artist Tom Grummett finishing pencils and Bob McLeod as inker. The storyline &quot;A Lonely Place of Dying&quot; crossed over with the &quot;Batman&quot; series and introduced Tim Drake as the new Robin. Pérez remained as inker for the cover art to issues #62–67 and co-plotted the stories for #66–67 before departing from the &quot;Titans&quot; series once again.

===Superman===
Pérez was involved with Superman in various times over his career, including his tenure on &quot;Justice League of America&quot; years before. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #544 (June 1983), he designed Lex Luthor&#x27;s trademark battlesuit. These new designs for the villain were featured as part of the licensed action figure toyline the &quot;Super Powers Collection&quot; and remain in use in today&#x27;s DC Comics continuity. Pérez pencilled &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #61 (Sept. 1983) which featured a Superman/OMAC team-up. A few years later, Pérez inked John Byrne&#x27;s pencils for the Superman/Wonder Woman story in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #600 (March 1988). He drew portions of &quot;Action Comics Annual&quot; #2 (1989) before taking over the title with issue #643 (July 1989). His work duties on &quot;Action Comics&quot; would change from writer/penciller, to co-writer/breakdowns, to providing breakdowns, with writer Roger Stern scripting stories and artists Brett Breeding and Kerry Gammill provided finishing art, while Pérez drew all covers during his run on the title, with the exception for issue #646 with interior pencils by Keith Giffen. With writer Stern, he co-created the character Maxima who first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #645 (September 1989). In the double-size anniversary issue #650 in February 1990, Pérez penciled and inked an eight page flashback story depicting Superman&#x27;s first post-&quot;Crisis&quot; encounter with the Justice League of America. Pérez briefly wrote &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;, providing plots for issues #457–59 (Aug. 1989 – Oct. 1989), and inks for issue #461 (Dec. 1989). Due to an already heavy workload while doing both &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; at the same time, he left &quot;Action Comics&quot; with issue #652 (April 1990).

===&quot;War of the Gods&quot; / &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot;===
It was during this run in 1991 that Pérez encountered problems working with DC. Pérez has stated that since the storyline&#x27;s inception, which ran through the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; comic and crossed over into others, he had trouble writing the &quot;War of the Gods&quot; storyline, mostly due to editorial problems. Pérez felt that DC was not doing enough to celebrate Wonder Woman&#x27;s 50-year anniversary. To make matters worse in his eyes, DC did not place &quot;War of the Gods&quot; in newsstand distribution, which meant that the comic book could only be found in comics specialty shops. Pérez had built up a plot to marry the characters Steve Trevor and Etta Candy in his final issue. When he discovered that DC editors had decided to not only pass the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; title&#x27;s writing to William Messner-Loebs and have Messner-Loebs write the final wedding scene, Pérez quit the title and separated himself from DC for several years. In 1992, he was guest inker on &quot;Deathstroke the Terminator&quot; issues #10–11.

Also in 1991, Pérez signed on to pencil the six-issue limited series &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot; for Marvel Comics, which was written by Jim Starlin. However, due to the turbulence happening concurrently with &quot;War of the Gods&quot;, this was a very stressful personal period for Pérez, and he was not able to finish penciling the entire run of &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, leaving the project part way through issue #4. The &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot; editorial team decided to find a replacement artist to finish the miniseries, and Ron Lim was the artist chosen (although Pérez offered to remain on as the inker over Lim&#x27;s cover art for the remainder of the miniseries).

Because of the debacles over &quot;War of the Gods&quot; and &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, Pérez began to gain a reputation as a creator who could not finish projects as planned. Furthering that impression, he worked with independent comic book publishers Malibu Comics, drawing &quot;Break-Thru&quot; and &quot;Ultraforce&quot; (both titles were part of Malibu&#x27;s Ultraverse imprint), and then working at Tekno Comix drawing &quot;I-Bots&quot;. However, despite being paid well by both publishers, he had no enthusiasm drawing the characters, and lost interest in drawing the titles.

===1990s and return to &quot;The Avengers&quot;===
In the 1990s, Pérez left the spotlight, although he worked on several projects, including working on the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; comic book adaptation of the movie for Topps Comics in 1993, adapted by Walt Simonson and pencilled by Gil Kane, with Pérez as inker, but most notably at Marvel Comics with &quot;Sachs and Violens&quot; and &quot;Hulk: Future Imperfect&quot;, both written by Peter David. David has named Pérez his favorite artistic collaborator, and one of the three artists whose art has mostly closely matched the visuals he conceived when writing a comic book script (the others being Leonard Kirk and Dale Keown).

Pérez returned to DC Comics in October 1996 for another incarnation of the &quot;Teen Titans&quot;. &quot;Teen Titans&quot; vol. 2 was written and penciled by Dan Jurgens, with Pérez as inker for the first 15 issues of its twenty four-issue run. The series ended in September 1998.

Pérez had a stint as writer of &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol. 2 #111–123 (December 1995 – December 1996). He would also write the crossover special &quot;Silver Surfer/Superman&quot; in 1996. Pérez finally returned to a major ongoing title for the third series of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, written by Kurt Busiek, where he remained for nearly three years, again receiving critical and fan acclaim for his polished and dynamic art. After leaving the series, he and Busiek produced the long-awaited &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; inter-company crossover, which saw print in late 2003. A JLA/Avengers crossover was to have been published in the 1980s, but differences between DC and Marvel forced the comic to be canceled. As the artist on the story, Pérez had drawn approximately 21 pages of the original crossover, which were not published until the 2004 hardcover edition of &quot;JLA/Avengers: The Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;.

===Gorilla Comics and CrossGen===
In 1997, Pérez began writing and illustrating &quot;Crimson Plague&quot;, a creator-owned science fiction story about an alien with ultra-toxic blood, with the first issue published by Event Comics. In June 2000, that issue was re-published by Gorilla Comics – a publishing imprint he co-owned with several other creators – with additional material and pages, with a follow-up issue published in September. Pérez cited the debt he&#x27;d acquired self-publishing as the reason for discontinuing the series. Artwork from the unpublished third issue was included in &quot;George Pérez Storyteller&quot;.

Pérez worked for new publisher CrossGen early in the 2000s, penciling four issues of &quot;CrossGen Chronicles&quot;. His main project for the company was penciling &quot;Solus&quot;, which was intended to be an ongoing series, but was cancelled after eight issues due to CrossGen&#x27;s bankruptcy.

===Return to DC===
In May 2006, Pérez illustrated the cover art to one of the alternative covers to the direct market release of the annual &quot;Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide&quot; (36th edition) featuring &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. He was guest artist for an issue of &quot;JSA&quot; #82 (April 2006) and was cover artist from issues #82–87. He drew the first ten issues of DC&#x27;s &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; (vol. 2) in 2007 with writer Mark Waid. Pérez worked on &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, a follow-up to &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, as a fill-in artist. He worked on &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; in 2008–2009, thus contributing to every chapter of DC&#x27;s &quot;Crisis&quot; trilogy. He worked with Marv Wolfman on a direct-to-DVD movie adaptation of the &quot;Judas Contract&quot; story arc from &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, scheduled for 2017.

He was co-chair of the board of the comic industry charity The Hero Initiative and served on its Disbursement Committee. In 2005, an animated version of Pérez made a cameo appearance in the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; episode titled &quot;Go&quot;, which was an adaptation of his &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; #1. In &quot;City of Heroes&quot;, an MMORPG about superheroes, a zone (Pérez Park) is named after him.

===2010s===

In September 2011, DC launched a new &quot;Superman&quot; series written by Pérez, who also provided breakdowns and cover art, with interior art by Jesús Merino and Nicola Scott. Pérez remained until issue #6. The &quot;New Teen Titans: Games&quot; hardcover graphic novel was published the same month reuniting the creative team of Wolfman and Pérez. He was the inker of the new &quot;Green Arrow&quot; series, also launched in the same timeframe, over artist Dan Jurgens&#x27; pencils, reuniting the mid-1990s &quot;Teen Titans&quot; art team. Pérez and Kevin Maguire were alternating artists on a &quot;Worlds&#x27; Finest&quot; revival written by Paul Levitz.

In July 2012, Pérez explained his departure from &quot;Superman&quot; as a reaction to the level of editorial oversight he experienced. This included inconsistent reasons given for rewrites of his material, the inability of editors to explain to him basic aspects of the New 52 Superman&#x27;s status quo (such as whether his adoptive parents were still alive), and restrictions imposed by having to be consistent with &quot;Action Comics&quot;, which was set five years earlier than &quot;Superman&quot;, a situation complicated by &quot;Action&quot; writer Grant Morrison having not been forthcoming about their plans.

From September 2014 to December 2016, Pérez wrote and drew six issues of his own creation &quot;Sirens&quot;, published by BOOM! Studios. It is a science fiction miniseries dedicated to a group of women with extraordinary powers, who fight against evil across time and space.

In January 2019, Pérez announced that he was formally retiring due to various health issues, and would continue to produce only a limited number of convention-style head sketches on commission, and attend a limited number of conventions.

==Personal life and death==
Pérez was married to Carol Flynn. He had no children. He had a brother David, and a niece and nephew.

In October 2013, Pérez revealed that he would soon undergo laser and injection surgeries to address hemorrhaging in his left eye that had effectively made him blind in that eye. By the following June, the procedures were not yet completed, but his condition had improved to the point that he was able to resume his work. In May 2017, he was admitted to a hospital with chest pains due to a heart attack while traveling to a convention, and had a coronary stent fitted. By January 2019, Perez was dealing with multiple health issues, including diabetes and problems with his vision and his heart.

In December 2021, he revealed that after undergoing surgery for a blockage in his liver, he had been diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer. Given a prognosis of 6 to 12 months, he chose not to pursue treatment. In early 2022, both DC and Marvel included tributes to him and his work in their comics, and jointly approved a limited-run reprint of the 2003 &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; story he illustrated (long tied up by disagreements between the rival publishers), as a benefit for The Hero Initiative.

Pérez died at his home on May 6, 2022, due to complications from pancreatic cancer. An open memorial service was held at MegaCon Orlando on May 22.

The 2024 film &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; was dedicated in his memory.

==Awards==
Pérez won a 1979 Eagle Award (with Jim Shooter, Sal Buscema, and David Wenzel) for Best Continued Story for his work on &quot;The Avengers&quot; #167–168 and 170–177. In 1980 he won the Eagle Award for Best Comicbook Cover for &quot;Avengers&quot; #185. He won the Eagle Award for Favourite Artist (penciller) in 1986. Pérez received an Inkpot Award in 1983.

In 1985, DC Comics named Pérez as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.

His work (with Marv Wolfman and Romeo Tanghal), earned &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; #50 a nomination for the 1985 Jack Kirby Award for Best Single Issue. His collaboration with Wolfman earned &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; the Jack Kirby Award for Best Finite Series in both 1985 and 1986.

Pérez has won several &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Awards&quot;. He won the &quot;Favorite Artist&quot; award in 1983 and 1985 and &quot;Favorite Penciler&quot; in 1987. In addition, he won the &quot;Favorite Cover Artist&quot; award three consecutive years 1985–1987. &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; won the award for &quot;Favorite Limited Series&quot; in 1985.

Pérez worked on several stories which won the CBG award for &quot;Favorite Comic-Book Story&quot;:
*1984 &quot;The Judas Contract&quot; in &quot;Tales of the Teen Titans&quot; #42–44 and &quot;Annual&quot; #3
*1985 &quot;Beyond the Silent Night&quot; in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #7
*1989 &quot;A Lonely Place of Dying&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #440–442 and &quot;The New Titans&quot; #60–61

In 2022, Pérez was awarded the Inkwell Awards Stacey Aragon Special Recognition Award (SASRA) for his lifetime achievement in inking.

<text>Joseph Locke FRSA (9 August 1805 – 18 September 1860) was an English civil engineer of the nineteenth century, particularly associated with railway projects. Locke ranked alongside Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel as one of the major pioneers of railway development.

==Early life and career==
Locke was born in Attercliffe, Sheffield in Yorkshire, moving to nearby Barnsley when he was five. By the age of 17, Joseph had already served an apprenticeship under William Stobart at Pelaw, on the south bank of the Tyne, and under his own father, William. He was an experienced mining engineer, able to survey, sink shafts, to construct railways, tunnels and stationary engines. Joseph&#x27;s father had been a manager at Wallbottle colliery on Tyneside when George Stephenson was a fireman there. In 1823, when Joseph was 17, Stephenson was involved with planning the Stockton and Darlington Railway. He and his son Robert Stephenson visited William Locke and his son at Barnsley and it was arranged that Joseph would go to work for the Stephensons. The Stephensons established a locomotive works near Forth Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, to manufacture locomotives for the new railway. Joseph Locke, despite his youth, soon established a position of authority. He and Robert Stephenson became close friends, but their friendship was interrupted, in 1824, by Robert leaving to work in Colombia for three years.

==Liverpool and Manchester Railway==
George Stephenson carried out the original survey of the line of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, but this was found to be flawed, and the line was re-surveyed by a talented young engineer, Charles Vignoles. Joseph Locke was asked by the directors to carry out another survey of the proposed tunnel works and produce a report. The report was highly critical of the work already done, which reflected badly on Stephenson. Stephenson was furious and henceforth relations between the two men were strained, although Locke continued to be employed by Stephenson, probably because the latter recognised his worth. Despite the many criticisms of Stephenson&#x27;s work, when the bill for the new line was finally passed, in 1826, Stephenson was appointed as engineer and he appointed Joseph Locke as his assistant to work alongside Vignoles, who was the other assistant. However, a clash of personalities between Stephenson and Vignoles led to the latter resigning, leaving Locke as the sole assistant engineer. Locke took over responsibility for the western half of the line. One of the major obstacles to be overcome was Chat Moss, a large bog that had to be crossed. Although, Stephenson usually gets the credit for this feat, it is believed that it was Locke who suggested the correct method for crossing the bog.

Whilst the line was being built, the directors were trying to decide whether to use standing engines or locomotives to propel the trains. Robert Stephenson and Joseph Locke were convinced that locomotives were vastly superior, and in March 1829 the two men wrote a report demonstrating the superiority of locomotives when used on a busy railway. The report led to the decision by the directors to hold an open trial to find the best locomotive. This was the Rainhill Trials, which were run in October 1829, and were won by &quot;Rocket&quot;.

When the line was finally opened in 1830, it was planned for a procession of eight trains to travel from Liverpool to Manchester and back. George Stephenson drove the leading locomotive &quot;Northumbrian&quot; and Joseph Locke drove &quot;Rocket&quot;. The day was marred by the death of William Huskisson, the Member of Parliament for Liverpool, who was struck and killed by &quot;Rocket&quot;.

==Grand Junction Railway==
In 1829 Locke was George Stephenson&#x27;s assistant, given the job of surveying the route for the Grand Junction Railway. This new railway was to join Newton-le-Willows on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway with Warrington and then on to Birmingham via Crewe, Stafford and Wolverhampton, a total of 80 miles.

Locke is credited with choosing the location for Crewe and recommending the establishment there of shops required for the building and repairs of carriages and wagons as well as engines.

During the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, Stephenson had shown a lack of ability in organising major civil engineering projects. On the other hand, Locke&#x27;s ability to manage complex projects was well known. The directors of the new railway decided on a compromise whereby Locke was made responsible for the northern half of the line and Stephenson was made responsible for the southern half. However Stephenson&#x27;s administrative inefficiency soon became apparent, whereas Locke estimated the costs for his section of the line so meticulously and speedily, that he had all of the contracts signed for his section of the line before a single one had been signed for Stephenson&#x27;s section. The railway company lost patience with Stephenson, but tried to compromise by making both men joint-engineers. Stephenson&#x27;s pride would not let him accept this, and so he resigned from the project. By autumn of 1835 Locke had become chief engineer for the whole of the line. This caused a rift between the two men, and strained relations between Locke and Robert Stephenson. Up to this point, Locke had always been under George Stephenson&#x27;s shadow. From then on, he would be his own man, and stand or fall by his own achievements.

The line was opened on 4 July 1837.

===New methods===

Locke&#x27;s route avoided as far as possible major civil engineering works. The main one was the Dutton Viaduct which crosses the River Weaver and the Weaver Navigation between the villages of Dutton and Acton Bridge in Cheshire. The viaduct consists of 20 arches with spans of 20 yards.

An important feature of the new railway was the use of double-headed (dumb-bell) wrought-iron rail supported on timber sleepers at 2 ft 6 in intervals. It was intended that when the rails became worn they could be turned over to use the other surface, but in practice it was found that the chairs into which the rails were keyed caused wear to the bottom surface so that it became uneven. However this was still an improvement on the fish-bellied, wrought-iron rails still being used by Robert Stephenson on the London and Birmingham Railway.

Locke was more careful than Stephenson to get value for his employers&#x27; money. For the Penkridge Viaduct Stephenson had obtained a tender of £26,000. After Locke took over, he gave the potential contractor better information and agreed a price of only £6,000. Locke also tried to avoid tunnels because in those days tunnels often took longer and cost more than planned. The Stephensons regarded 1 in 330 as the maximum slope that an engine could manage and Robert Stephenson achieved this on the London and Birmingham Railway by using seven tunnels which added both cost and delay. Locke avoided tunnels almost completely on the Grand Junction but exceeded the slope limit for six miles south of Crewe.

Proof of Locke&#x27;s ability to estimate costs accurately is given by the fact that the construction of the Grand Junction line cost £18,846 per mile as against Locke&#x27;s estimate of £17,000. This is amazingly accurate compared with the estimated costs for the London and Birmingham Railway (Robert Stephenson) and the Great Western Railway (Brunel).

Locke also divided the project into a few large sections rather than many small ones. This allowed him to work closely with his contractors to develop the best methods, overcome problems and personally gain practical experience of the building process and of the contractors themselves. He used the contractors who worked well with him, especially Thomas Brassey, William Buddicom and William Mackenzie, on many other projects. Everyone gained from this cooperative approach whereas Brunel&#x27;s more adversarial approach eventually made it hard for him to get anyone to work for him.

==Marriage==
In 1834 Locke married Phoebe McCreery, with whom he adopted a child. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1838.

==Lancaster and Carlisle Railway==

A significant difference in philosophy between George Stephenson and Joseph Locke and the surveying methods they employed was more than a mere difference of opinion. Stephenson had started his career at a time when locomotives had little power to overcome excessive gradients. Both George and Robert Stephenson were prepared to go to great lengths to avoid steep gradients that would tax the locomotives of the day, even if this meant choosing a circuitous path that added on extra miles to the line of the route. Locke had more confidence in the ability of modern locomotives to climb these gradients. An example of this was the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, which had to cope with the barrier of the Lake District mountains. In 1839 Stephenson proposed a circuitous route that avoided the Lake District altogether by going all the way round Morecambe Bay and West Cumberland, claiming: &#x27;This is the only practicable line from Liverpool to Carlisle. The making of a railway across Shap Fell is out of the question.&#x27; The directors rejected his route and chose the one proposed by Joseph Locke, one that used steep gradients and passed over Shap Fell. The line was completed by Locke and was a success.

Locke&#x27;s reasoned that by avoiding long routes and tunnelling, the line could be finished more quickly, with less capital costs, and could start earning revenue sooner. This became known as the &#x27;up and over&#x27; school of engineering (referred to by Rolt as &#x27;Up and Down,&#x27; or Rollercoaster). Locke took a similar approach in planning the Caledonian Railway, from Carlisle to Glasgow. In both railways he introduced gradients of 1 in 75, which severely taxed fully laden locomotives, for even as more powerful locomotives were introduced, the trains that they pulled became heavier. It may therefore be argued that Locke, although his philosophy carried the day, was not entirely correct in his reasoning. Even today, Shap Fell is a severe test of any locomotive.

==Manchester and Sheffield Railway==

Locke was subsequently appointed to build a railway line from Manchester to Sheffield, replacing Charles Vignoles as chief engineer, after the latter had been beset by misfortunes and financial difficulties. The project included the three-mile Woodhead Tunnel, and the line opened, after many delays, on 23 December 1845. The building of the line required over a thousand navvies and cost the lives of thirty-two of them, seriously injuring 140 others. The Woodhead Tunnel was such a difficult undertaking that George Stephenson claimed that it could not be done, declaring that he would eat the first locomotive that got through the tunnel.

==Subsequent commissions==
In the north, Locke also designed the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway; the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway; and the Caledonian Railway from Carlisle to Glasgow and Edinburgh.

In the south, he worked on the London and Southampton Railway, later called the London and South Western Railway, designing, among other structures, Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct, Richmond Railway Bridge (1848, since replaced), and Barnes Railway Bridge (1849), both across the River Thames, tunnels at Micheldever, and the 12-arch Quay Street viaduct and the 16-arch Cams Hill viaduct, both in Fareham (1848).
He was actively involved in planning and building many railways in Europe (assisted by John Milroy), including the Le Havre, Rouen, Paris rail link, the Barcelona to Mataró line and the Dutch Rhenish Railway. He was present in Paris when the Versailles train crash occurred in 1842, and produced a statement concerning the facts for General Charles Pasley of the Railway Inspectorate. He also experienced a catastrophic failure of one of his viaducts built on the new Paris-Le Havre link. . The viaduct was of stone and brick at Barentin near Rouen, and was the longest and highest on the line. It was 108 feet high, and consisted of 27 arches, each 50 feet wide, with a total length of over 1600 feet. A boy hauling ballast for the line up an adjoining hillside early that morning (about 6.00 am) saw one arch (the fifth on the Rouen side) collapse, and the rest followed suit. Fortunately, no one was killed, although several workmen were injured in a mill below the structure. Locke attributed the catastrophic failure to frost action on the new lime cement, and premature off-centre loading of the viaduct with ballast. It was rebuilt at Thomas Brassey&#x27;s cost, and survives to the present. Having pioneered many new lines in France, Locke also helped establish the first locomotive works in the country.

Distinctive features of Locke&#x27;s railway works were economy, the use of masonry bridges wherever possible and the absence of tunnels. An illustration of this is that there is no tunnel between Birmingham and Glasgow.

==Relationship with Robert Stephenson==

Locke and Robert Stephenson had been good friends at the beginning of their careers, but their friendship had been marred by Locke&#x27;s falling out with Robert&#x27;s father. It seems that Robert felt loyalty to his father required that he should take his side. It is significant that after the death of George Stephenson in August 1848, the friendship of the two men was revived. When Robert Stephenson died in October 1859, Joseph Locke was a pallbearer at his funeral. Locke is reported to have referred to Robert as &#x27;the friend of my youth, the companion of my ripening years, and a competitor in the race of life&#x27;. Locke was also on friendly terms with his other engineering rival, Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

In 1845, Locke and Stephenson were both called to give evidence before two committees. In April a House of Commons Select Committee was investigating the atmospheric railway system proposed by Brunel. Brunel and Vignoles spoke in support of the system, whilst Locke and Stephenson spoke against it. The latter two were to be proved right in the long run. In August the two gave evidence before the Gauge Commissioners who were trying to arrive at a standard gauge for the whole country. Brunel spoke in favour of the 7 ft gauge he was using on the Great Western Railway. Locke and Stephenson spoke in favour of the 4 ft 8½in gauge that they had used on several lines. The latter two won the day and their gauge was adopted as the standard.

==Later life and legacy==

Locke served as President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in between December 1857 and December 1859. He also served as Member of Parliament for Honiton in Devon from 1847 until his death.

Joseph Locke died on 18 September 1860, apparently from appendicitis, whilst on a shooting holiday. He is buried in London&#x27;s Kensal Green Cemetery. He outlived his friends/rivals Robert Stephenson and Isambard Brunel by less than a year; all three engineers died between 53 and 56 years of age, a circumstance attributed by Rolt to sheer overwork, accomplishing more in their brief lives than many achieve in a full three score and ten.

Locke Park in Barnsley was dedicated to his memory by his widow Phoebe in 1862. It features a statue of Locke plus a folly, &#x27;Locke Tower&#x27;.

Locke&#x27;s greatest legacy is the modern day West Coast Main Line (WCML), which was formed by the joining of the Caledonian, Lancaster &amp; Carlisle, Grand Junction railways to Robert Stephenson&#x27;s London &amp; Birmingham Railway. As a result, around three-quarters of the WCML&#x27;s route was planned and engineered by Locke.

A commemorative plaque was unveiled at Lancaster station on the 150th anniversary of his death.

<doc id="354716" wikidata="Q4710549" url="?curid=354716" title="Albert J. Ruffo">
<text>Albert J. Ruffo (July 1, 1908 – February 10, 2003) was an American politician, philanthropist, educator, lawyer, and football coach.

Ruffo grew up in Tacoma, Washington. In 1927 he moved to San Jose, California to attend nearby Santa Clara University, where he played football, and graduated with degrees in political science, electrical engineering, and literature. After graduating in 1931, Ruffo taught in the university&#x27;s school of engineering and coached the freshman football team to help pay for attending law school. In 1936 he graduated at the head of his class from Santa Clara University School of Law. After passing the bar exam, he continued to coach football with the university as the assistant varsity coach under legendary SCU head coach Lawrence T. &quot;Buck&quot; Shaw and helped lead the team to victory in the 1937 and 1938 Sugar Bowls against LSU.

In San Francisco, Ruffo and a former college football teammate, Tony Morabito, became partners in a lumber delivery business. But Morabito soon began to focus on starting a pro football franchise and Ruffo was enlisted to set up the legal framework for what was to become Morabito&#x27;s San Francisco 49ers, who began play in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946. While waiting for the 49ers&#x27; (and the AAFC&#x27;s) first season of operation Buck Shaw and Ruffo spent the 1945 season as head coach and assistant for the University of California Golden Bears.

He was an assistant coach to Buck Shaw for the 49ers first two years of operation, which happened to be while he was serving as mayor of San Jose, California. He later became a part owner of the team and remained so for 24 years until it was sold to Eddie DeBartolo, Jr. in 1977.

He served eight years on the San Jose city council (1944–1952), and was the city&#x27;s 48th mayor from 1946 to 1948. During his time on the council, A. P. Hamann, another of Ruffo&#x27;s teammates at Santa Clara, was hired as city manager and the rapid growth of San Jose began. After leaving public office, Ruffo worked as an attorney, specializing in land development law; Ruffo represented land developers in many of the city&#x27;s annexation and zoning hearings, lawsuits, and deals.

A 1979 San Jose State University study ranked Ruffo as one of the 10 most powerful people in San Jose. In 1997, he was inducted into the Santa Clara County Sports Hall of Fame.

Ruffo filed a lawsuit in 1998 against San Jose&#x27;s new leaders to stop them from using redevelopment funds to build a new city hall. In 2001, he won a state appeals court ruling on the case.

He died in San Jose, California on February 10, 2003. He was remembered as a &quot;Beloved husband of Marianne Ruffo of San Jose.&quot;

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 33, commonly referred to as Highway 33 or Loyalist Parkway, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The route begins at Highway 62 in Bloomfield and travels east to the Collins Bay Road junction at Collins Bay in the city of Kingston, a distance of . The highway continues farther east into Kingston as Bath Road (Kingston Road 33), ending at the former Highway 2, now Princess Street. Highway 33 is divided into two sections by the Bay of Quinte. The Glenora Ferry service crosses between the two sections just east of Picton, transporting vehicles and pedestrians for free throughout the year.

Originally, Highway 33 continued northeast through Trenton to the town of Stirling, ending at a junction with Highway 14. This section was transferred to county governments by the beginning of 1998. In 2009, Highway 33 west of Picton became the site of the first modern roundabout on a provincial highway.

In 1984, Queen Elizabeth commemorated Highway 33 between Trenton and Kingston as the Loyalist Parkway at a ceremony in Amherstview in honour of the settlers that landed there in 1784.

== Route description ==

Highway 33, known as the Loyalist Parkway throughout its length, begins in the west at the southern terminus of Highway 62, west of which the parkway continues as Prince Edward County Road 33 to Trenton. The route begins within the community of Bloomfield. To the east it crosses several creeks then intersects Prince Edward County Road 1 at the first modern provincially maintained roundabout. East of this, the highway enters into the city of Picton.

Within Picton, Highway 33 intersects the former Highway 49, now Prince Edward County Road 49. It exits the city and follows the southeastern shoreline of Picton Bay, passing the H.J. McFarland Conservation Area midway between the city and Glenora.
Highway 33 has two sections, which are joined by the Glenora Ferry, an auto ferry crossing the Bay of Quinte from Glenora to Adolphustown. The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), which maintains Highway 33, also provides the ferry service free of charge.
The eastern section of the highway begins west of Adolphustown, where it passes by several Loyalist heritage sites. Now in the county of Lennox and Addington, the route remains close to the shores of the Bay of Quinte for the remainder of its journey towards Kingston. It divides the Greater Napanee communities of Conway, South Fredericksburg, Parma, Sandhurst Shores and Sandhurst, then enters the municipality of Loyalist opposite Amherst Island. The highway passes through Bath, after which it follows the Bath Road, one of the oldest roads in Ontario, built circa 1785.
At Millhaven, a ferry service provides access to Amherst Island; Highway 33 continues east and passes through Amherstview before crossing the county line into Frontenac County and the City of Kingston.

The short section of Highway 33 within Kingston travels as far east as Collins Bay Road, in the community of Collins Bay. From this point, the road continues east as Bath Road (Kingston City Road 33), ending at Princess Street, formerly Highway 2.

Highway 33 is in length, excluding the length of the Glenora Ferry. Traffic volumes vary considerably throughout the length of the route. On an average day, over 5,000 vehicles travel the section between Bloomfield and Picton. Between Picton and the Glenora Ferry, volumes drop to under 2,000. On the opposite shore, traffic volumes grow from over 6,000 near Bath to over 11,000 outside of Kingston.

== History ==
Highway 33, also known since 1984 as the Loyalist Parkway, follows a pioneer colonial route on which the first segments were built two hundred years prior. The route connects several historical settlement sites in Prince Edward County, continuing east through Bath to what is now Kingston.

In 1784, following the American Revolution, the United Empire Loyalists began to arrive in Upper Canada, hoping to settle the frontier near Cataraqui (now Kingston). With the help of the military, the loyalists blazed a trail west from Cataraqui to Bath, a distance of . This trail would become a section of Highway 33 nearly 150 years later.

On June 5, 1799, Asa Danforth Jr. began construction eastward from Toronto on a road which was to extend the Governor&#x27;s Road through Port Hope and to the Trent River. That road, completed in 1801, would be described by acting surveyor general William Chewett to be &quot;good&quot; for use in the dead of winter but &quot;impassible&quot; during the wet summers, when the path turned to a bottomless mud pit. It would be extended in 1802 to reach the Bay of Quinte at Stone Mills (now Glenora) and a ferry crossing established to Adolphustown. The Bath extension of the Danforth Road (1802) provided access to a key early colonial road, the Bath Road, which had long joined Bath to Kingston.

Sporadic privately operated ferry services between Adolphustown and Stone Mills (Glenora) were initially a primitive affair. In October 1835 a Mr. Clark from Cobourg tipped out of the bark canoe ferrying him to Glenora and was buried without an inquest; a year earlier, a Rev. Mathew Miller from Cobourg had drowned after falling through the February ice. The road itself was no better, barely adequate for horse and rider but unfit to run stagecoach lines.

This road would serve as the initial mail road linking Kingston to Toronto, but was poorly maintained and soon allowed to fall into disrepair. By 1817, the Kingston Road replaced or bypassed much of Danforth&#x27;s Road, following a similar path to the Trent River (with minor improvements in routing around Scarborough, Port Hope, Cobourg and Grafton) but then blazing a more northerly route through Belleville and Napanee. Like the Danforth Road before it, this 1817 York Road was initially a muddy dirt road; it would, however, suffice to establish reliable scheduled stagecoach runs by which mail and passengers could make the two-day trip from Kingston to Toronto and permit enterprises (such as the branches of the newly established Bank of Montreal) safe and timely delivery of documents and valuables. By 1839, the Napanee-Kingston route was being improved for use as a gravel toll road.

While the area around Bath and the Bay of Quinte would remain a major agricultural region, the pattern of redirecting Kingston-Toronto traffic further inland which started with construction of the Kingston Road (1817) would be repeated with the Grand Trunk Railway (1856) and ultimately Highway 401 (1964).

Due to its historic role in early colonisation and its prime waterfront scenic location, the original route from Kingston westward through Bath and the Quinte Region would be commemorated in 1984 by Queen Elizabeth as the Loyalist Parkway.

Ironically, the first section of Highway 33 to be assumed as provincial highway is not part of the commemorated Loyalist Parkway. On July 9, 1930, the Department of Highways assumed the Trenton–Stirling Road as King&#x27;s Highway 33, a distance of approximately .
In July 1934, as part of a depression-relief effort, the Carrying Place Trail through Prince Edward County and the United Counties of Lennox and Addington was assumed as an extension of Highway 33. (The section between Trenton and Glenora was assumed on July 4, 1934, the section between Adolphustown and Kingston on July 11.) The provincially operated ferries, as the first to operate without a toll on the route, entered service after 1936.

In 1984, Queen Elizabeth toured the Kingston area as part of its two hundredth anniversary, attending several events and ceremonies through her visit. On her final day in the region, she dedicated the Loyalist Parkway in honour of the settlers that landed there in 1784. The ceremony was held in Amherstview on September 27, 1984.

In 1998, all portions of Highway 33 west of Ontario Highway 62, Bloomfield or east of Collins Bay Road, Kingston were decertified as provincial highway and downloaded as county or city roads.
In 2009, the intersection of Highway 33 and Prince Edward County Road 1 (Scoharie Road) near Picton saw the introduction of a traffic roundabout, the first ever constructed on a provincial highway in the province, to replace the at-grade intersection. The MTO felt that the area had reached its operational threshold due to high tourist and recreational activity, particularly during the busy summer months, and so felt a traffic roundabout was needed.

The engineering and consulting firm Morrison Hershfield was retained to undertake the detail design for the realignment and reconfiguration of the existing intersection at Highway 33 and Country Road 1 into a single lane roundabout with a central island and truck apron. The assignment included highway engineering, drainage and hydrology engineering, electrical engineering, public consultation, and traffic engineering. The roundabout was officially opened on July 17, 2009.

<text>The Sports Network (TSN) is a Canadian English language discretionary sports specialty channel owned by the Sports Network Inc., a subsidiary of CTV Specialty Television, which is also a joint venture of Bell Media (70%), also owned by BCE Inc. and ESPN Inc. (30%), itself a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company. TSN was established by the Labatt Brewing Company in 1984 as part of the first group of Canadian specialty cable channels. In 2013, TSN was the largest specialty channel in Canada in terms of gross revenue, with a total of in revenue.

TSN broadcasts primarily from studio facilities located at Bell Media Agincourt in the Scarborough neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario. Stewart Johnston currently serves as president of TSN, a position he has held since 2010. TSN&#x27;s networks focus on sports-related programming, including live and recorded event telecasts, sports talk shows, and other original programming.

==History==
=== Early history ===

Licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on April 2, 1984, as the &quot;Action Canada Sports Network&quot;, the channel was launched by the Labatt Brewing Company on September 1 of the same year as The Sports Network, or TSN. The network was founded under the leadership of Gordon Craig, a former employee of CBC Sports; alongside coverage of the then co-owned Toronto Blue Jays, TSN also reached a deal with ESPN (itself only 5 years old) shortly before launch to provide additional programs. Although reaching around 400,000 subscribers, TSN&#x27;s early years were hindered by its initial status as a premium service, bundled in a high-cost package with movie channels such as First Choice and Superchannel, alongside competition with free-to-air sports broadcasts by CBC Television among others.

To improve the prominence of the network, TSN sought to obtain the national cable rights to the National Hockey League—rights that, according to the league, were not sold under the current arrangement with CBC. However, the task was complicated by claims by CBC that it owned the cable rights to the NHL, along with the involvement of competing beer company Molson in Canadian NHL rights at the time. With the help of a Molson employee who was a friend of Gordon, a deal was reached between TSN, Molson, and the NHL to allow the network to broadcast games on cable.

By December 1987, TSN had reached one million subscribers, but the network&#x27;s staff sought wider distribution for the channel as part of basic cable service; the CRTC approved the network&#x27;s request for permission to allow TSN to be carried as part of a basic cable lineup. Mike Day, producer of TSN&#x27;s daily sports news program &quot;SportsDesk&quot; lamented about the shift to basic cable and the larger audience it would bring, commenting that &quot;one night you&#x27;re doing a news show that potentially has an audience of one million people, and the next day the potential is five million people.&quot; 
In 1991, TSN acquired rights to the IIHF World Junior Championship, otherwise known as the &quot;World Juniors&quot;, which were previously broadcast by CBC. TSN&#x27;s coverage, along with the recent &quot;Punch-up in Piestany&quot; incident and a strong performance by Canada at the tournament in the mid-1990s, helped to significantly heighten the profile of the tournament in the country (even more so than in other participating countries), to the point that it is, alongside U.S. college football bowl games, regarded as a traditional sporting event of the holiday season in Canada.

Due to CRTC regulations on the foreign ownership of broadcasters, Labatt was forced to sell TSN and RDS upon its acquisition by Interbrew in 1995. Labatt&#x27;s broadcasting assets were sold to a privately held consortium named NetStar Communications, the investors of which included a number of Canadian firms as well as ESPN Inc., which held an interest of about 30 percent. The same CRTC regulations prevented ESPN from establishing its own separate Canadian sports network outright, so acquiring a minority stake in TSN became ESPN&#x27;s alternative plan to get into the Canadian market. The Sports Network launched its website TSN.ca on October 1, 1995.

In 1997, the CRTC began permitting TSN to offer an &quot;alternate feed&quot;, which could be used to provide a regional opt-out of the main TSN service for programming that must be blacked out in the rest of the country. Alternate programming could make up a maximum of 10% of the TSN schedule—an average of 2.4 hours a day.

===Acquisition by CTV, expansion===
In 2000, after ESPN blocked two attempts by the Canadian partners to sell NetStar to Canwest, CTV Inc. acquired the Canadian partners&#x27; shares. CTV Inc. was acquired by Bell Canada and The Woodbridge Company (publisher of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper) as part of the joint venture Bell Globemedia in 2001. As a result of its purchase of TSN, CTV would be forced to sell its regional sports network CTV Sportsnet, eventually selling it to minority shareholder Rogers Media. Following the acquisition, TSN would move its operations to CTV&#x27;s Agincourt complex in the Toronto district of Scarborough. This oddity would become an inside joke between personalities on both networks, who commonly referred to jumping between the two networks as &quot;crossing the parking lot.&quot;

Following the sale, TSN began to closer align its on-air imaging with that of ESPN; the most prominent effect of these changes came with the introduction of a new logo similar to that of ESPN, and the re-branding of TSN&#x27;s flagship sports news program &quot;SportsDesk&quot; as &quot;SportsCentre&quot;—a Canadian version (in both format and spelling) of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. The CRTC, however, objected to plans to rename TSN as &quot;ESPN Canada&quot;, citing concerns that it would make it appear that ESPN had &quot;de facto&quot; majority control, or at the very least that TSN was ESPN&#x27;s Canadian affiliate.

TSN also launched a number of digital specialty channels in 2001; including a local version of ESPN Classic, the NHL Network— a network devoted to ice hockey and the National Hockey League, and WTSN—a channel dedicated to women&#x27;s sports On August 15, 2003, TSN became one of the first two specialty television services in Canada (the other being fellow Bell property Discovery Channel, now USA Network) to be available in high definition. TSN&#x27;s first live HD broadcast was of a Canadian Football League game between the Montreal Alouettes and Hamilton Tiger-Cats—it was to occur on the same day, but was delayed to August 16 due to a major electrical power failure that occurred the day prior.

Beginning in 2006, the CRTC officially allowed TSN to operate national secondary digital feeds with limited amounts of alternative programming. Following this development, TSN began to use such a feed to broadcast additional programming that could not be aired on TSN due to scheduling conflicts or other events. On August 29, 2008, the feed evolved into a new 24-hour channel, similar to ESPN2, known as TSN2. Upon its launch, TSN2 was legally considered a west coast timeshift feed of TSN, although soon after TSN2 was launched, the CRTC announced a proposal to remove genre exclusivity protections for &quot;mainstream sports&quot; and &quot;national news&quot; channels in the near future. As a byproduct of the decision, TSN would be allowed to use streamlined conditions of licence (legally referred to as a Category C license as of September 2011), which state that the service may offer &quot;multiple feeds&quot; consistent with their licensed programming format, without any restrictions on alternate programming. TSN was officially permitted to use these streamlined conditions of licence on February 1, 2010.

===Acquisition by Bell, TSN Radio===
On September 10, 2010, Bell Canada announced plans to re-acquire 100% of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s broadcasting arm, including its majority control of TSN. Under the deal, Woodbridge Company Limited, Torstar, and the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan would together receive $1.3 billion in either cash or equity in BCE, while BCE would also assume $1.7 billion in debt (BCE&#x27;s existing equity interest is $200 million, for a total transaction value of $3.2 billion). Woodbridge has since simultaneously regained majority control of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, with Bell retaining a 15% interest in December 2010. The deal closed on April 1, 2011, after the CRTC approved the sale on March 7, 2011 – the new company became known as Bell Media.
After a longstanding speculation about TSN&#x27;s interest in launching its own TSN-branded radio network (similarly to its U.S. counterpart), TSN entered radio broadcasting with the launch of the first TSN Radio station, a relaunch of AM station CHUM in Toronto on April 13, 2011. Bell Media&#x27;s Bell Media Radio division already operated several sports radio stations elsewhere in Canada (most of which were branded as The Team, a name introduced by previous owner CHUM Limited in its own failed attempt at establishing a national sports radio network), it was reported that Bell could theoretically relaunch these other stations under the TSN Radio brand in the future.

Also in 2011, TSN acquired broadcast rights to the new Winnipeg Jets. TSN would establish another part-time feed, TSN Jets, to broadcast the games. Additionally, co-owned CFRW would also gain radio rights to the new Jets. CFRW, along with Montreal station CKGM, also migrated to the TSN Radio brand on October 5, 2011. Additionally, Bell would also launch TSN Mobile TV, streaming versions of TSN and TSN2 offered through Bell Mobility&#x27;s Mobile TV services.

On December 9, 2011, the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan announced that it would sell its majority stake in Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment to two major telecommunications companies; Bell Canada (TSN&#x27;s main parent company) and Rogers Communications (owners of the competing Sportsnet chain of sports channels) with a 37.5% share each (Larry Tanenbaum increased his ownership to a quarter of the company as well), in a deal expected to be valued at around $1.32 billion in total. The deal was completed in summer 2012, following the approval of Canada&#x27;s Competition Bureau, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (with regards to MLSE&#x27;s television channels), as well as the leagues for each of MLSE&#x27;s main sports franchises. The deal was expected to have a major impact on future broadcast rights for MLSE&#x27;s teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors, as their ownership of the teams will offer enhanced coverage for the team through new platforms such as mobile television.

In March 2014, TSN launched its TV Everywhere service TSN Go, allowing subscribers to TSN on participating service providers to stream TSN networks online or through a mobile app. On launch, TSN Go was available exclusively to Bell Satellite TV and Rogers Cable subscribers. It has since been expanded to other providers, such as Shaw.

=== Loss of national NHL rights, expansion into regional service ===
Following the announcement of Bell and Rogers&#x27; acquisition of MLSE, concerns were again raised by critics, speculating that Bell Media could attempt to acquire full rights to the NHL after CBC&#x27;s current contract with the league expires following the 2013–14 season – using their ownership of the Toronto Maple Leafs, the NHL&#x27;s highest valued franchise, as an impetus for such a coup. Concerns were also raised that such an arrangement could prevent wireless service providers other than Bell and Rogers from accessing its content; the CRTC had ruled in favour of Telus in a decision requiring Bell and other media companies to allow other competing wireless providers access to its content, and not exclusively tie it to their own service (as they had attempted to do with TSN Mobile TV). However, in November 2013, Rogers Communications announced that it had reached a 12-year deal to become the sole national television rightsholder of the NHL, beginning in the 2014–15 season.

Critics considered Rogers&#x27; move to be a major blow against Bell and TSN, showing concerns for how the network could sustain itself without what is considered a key property in Canadian sports broadcasting. However, they also acknowledged the network&#x27;s continuing rights to IIHF hockey tournaments (including the popular World Junior Hockey Championships), the Canadian Football League (who renewed their contract with TSN without allowing any outside bidders in 2019 and whose current contract lasts through 2025), and TSN&#x27;s growing regional NHL rights portfolio, including the Maple Leafs—which would, beginning in the same season, air 26 games on TSN per season. In a series of Twitter posts by TSN personality Bob McKenzie, he explained that even with the loss of national NHL rights, TSN&#x27;s goal was to remain &quot;THE source for all things hockey&quot; through its analysis programs and regional coverage, and that this was not the first time that TSN had lost its cable rights to the NHL (having lost them to CTV Sportsnet for a period upon its launch in 1998).

On May 6, 2014, TSN announced that it would launch three new channels—TSN3, TSN4, and TSN5, in September 2014 to coincide with the network&#x27;s 30th anniversary. TSN president Stewart Johnston described the expansion as an &quot;important evolution&quot; for the network, as it would allow TSN to make more efficient use of its portfolio of sports properties: the network promoted that these new channels would allow TSN to broadcast a larger amount of ESPN content and live events, particularly including expanded coverage of major events (such as Grand Slam tennis, curling tournaments, and the NCAA basketball tournament) with multiple games occurring simultaneously. Although the expansion was discussed by TSN staff as early as 2012, critics considered the loss of NHL rights to Rogers (which had recently launched its seventh Sportsnet-branded television service with its acquisition of The Score, now Sportsnet 360) to be a catalyst for the move, as TSN attempts to defend its position as the largest specialty television service in Canada in terms of total revenue. The launch date of these new channels were pushed up to August 25, 2014, in order to allow multi-court coverage of the 2014 US Open tennis tournament, which began the same day. TSN also announced that it would use these new channels to house regional NHL games beginning in the 2014–15 season, featuring the Jets, Maple Leafs, and Ottawa Senators. At the same time, Dave Krikst created &quot;BarDown,&quot; a segment on TSN&#x27;s YouTube page focused on attracting a younger audience. Made up of TSN producers Jesse Pollock, Corwin McCallum, Daniel Zakrzewski, Luca Celebre, and others, they post hockey-focused quizzes and beer league content.

On January 13, 2016, TSN announced that it would present its first telecast in 4K ultra high-definition—a Toronto Raptors basketball game—on January 20, 2016. It was followed by a slate of regional NHL games and other Raptors games in the format.

On June 7, 2018, TSN announced that it would offer its channels as part of an over-the-top subscription service branded as &quot;TSN Direct&quot;. By late 2022, the &quot;Direct&quot; branding was dropped.

On January 12, 2023, TSN announced a separate direct-to-consumer service called &quot;TSN+&quot;, which launched the same day with a limited-time free preview. The service, which is comparable but not entirely equivalent to ESPN+, initially includes Canadian rights to PGA Tour Live (acquired after Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s GolfTV ceased operations), the NTT IndyCar Series (previously on Sportsnet), the relaunching XFL, as well as various other properties such as La Liga and &quot;AEW Rampage&quot; which were previously available as bonus streams to subscribers of the regular TSN service.

==Channels==

As is permitted for all Category C sports services, the TSN licence is permitted to have multiple channels, and currently encompasses all of the channels listed in the table below. However, unlike premium services like Crave, subscribers receiving one TSN channel are not necessarily automatically entitled to receive all additional channels, and in many cases they are (or previously were) only available by paying a separate charge to a service provider. For example, until 2013, Rogers Cable customers were required to subscribe to the HD Specialty Pack add-on in order to receive TSN HD (whereas most other HD simulcast channels were provided at no additional charge). On many providers including Rogers, TSN1, 3, 4 and 5 were included in a single package when those feeds launched, but TSN2 was provided only as part of a separate higher-tier package.

On May 6, 2014, TSN announced plans to launch three additional multiplex channels, for a total of five 24-hour national channels. The existing &quot;TSN&quot; service was replaced by four regionally-focused channels (referred to as &quot;feeds&quot;)—TSN1, 3, 4, and 5—similar to the Sportsnet regional channels. All five channels are available nationally, but on most local providers, the channel location previously occupied by TSN&#x27;s primary service was filled by the appropriate regional feed. While major sports telecasts are simulcast across TSN1, 3, 4, and 5 to ensure national coverage, alternative studio shows and live events can also be split across the channels. The feeds carry a small amount of programming tailored towards their respective regions, including simulcasts of lunch-hour shows from TSN Radio stations in their relevant region, and regional NHL coverage. When TV listings and promotions make a reference to a program airing on &quot;the TSN network&quot; or simply &quot;TSN&quot; without disambiguation, it can normally be assumed that the program will be simulcast on TSN1, 3, 4 and 5.

Their launch date was originally announced as September 1, 2014, to coincide with the 30th anniversary of TSN&#x27;s launch, but was moved up to August 25 in order to accommodate multiple-court coverage throughout the 2014 US Open. Prior to the launch of the additional feeds, Bell executives stated that the expanded five-channel service would be offered for the same rate as was charged at the time for TSN and TSN2 together. Notwithstanding this claim, some providers, including Shaw Cable, have elected to charge extra for some of the new feeds. Most major Canadian television providers carried the new channels upon their launch, including Bell, Cogeco, Eastlink, MTS, SaskTel, Shaw, Source Cable, Rogers, and Telus.

Videotron, a cable provider which primarily serves the province of Quebec, was a notable hold-out for the new feeds. On October 13, a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game was left unavailable in English (due to a rained out MLB playoff game, RDS2 was able to carry the game in French) to Videotron subscribers because TSN5—the only feed it carried—was airing a regional Ottawa Senators/Florida Panthers NHL game (a game which also attracted infamy for having the lowest attendance of any Panthers game in team history). On October 16, 2014, Videotron president Manon Brouillette responded to complaints by subscribers surrounding the incident, and confirmed that it had reached a deal in September to carry the new feeds; the addition of TSN1 to the lineup was accelerated to October 20, 2014, to ensure the availability of that week&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game, with the remainder added on October 29, 2014. On November 27, 2016, a one-time overflow channel was used to broadcast a regional Ottawa Senators game due to conflicts with the 104th Grey Cup (which featured the Ottawa RedBlacks, and was being simulcast across all TSN regional feeds).

The current TSN feeds, and any programming unique to each feed as per TSN&#x27;s current TV schedules (subject to pre-emption by either ESPN or TSN due to live events), is shown below.

The French-language Réseau des sports and related channels operate under a separate licence, as did TSN&#x27;s other now-defunct sports networks WTSN and the Canadian versions of ESPN Classic and NHL Network.

In January 2025, TSN will begin to use USA Network (formerly Discovery) as an additional overflow channel for some of its sports rights, with NASCAR Xfinity Series races and &quot;AEW Collision&quot; moving to the newly-relaunched channel.

==Programming==

Alongside its live sports broadcasts, TSN also airs a variety of sports highlight, talk, and documentary-styled shows. These include:

* &quot;Motoring&quot; (automotive) – An automotive newsmagazine program focusing on reviews and features about new automotive vehicles, including results of test drives 
* &quot;SportsCentre&quot; – The flagship program, a daily sports news program delivering the latest sports news and highlights
* &quot;That&#x27;s Hockey&quot; (hockey) – Daily hockey news program that presents the latest news in the sport

In connection with ESPN&#x27;s minority ownership in TSN, the network has a long-term agreement with ESPN International for the Canadian rights to ESPN original and studio programs, including &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot;, &quot;Around the Horn&quot;, &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot;, &quot;NFL Live&quot;, &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot;, &quot;ESPN FC&quot;, and ESPN Films documentaries including the &quot;30 for 30&quot; series, among others, though it does not always air these programs simultaneously with their U.S. broadcasts.

In 2012, as part of promotion for the 100th Grey Cup, TSN produced its own anthology of documentary films, &quot;Engraved on a Nation&quot;, focusing on stories related to the Grey Cup and CFL. In 2019, TSN revived the series with a second season, chronicling other major figures in Canadian sports.

== Domestic broadcast rights ==

=== Hockey ===
TSN is a major broadcaster of ice hockey in Canada; it holds rights to Hockey Canada tournaments, which includes the Allan Cup, Centennial Cup, Telus Cup and Esso Cup, as well as IIHF tournaments such as the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s World Championships, the IIHF World Junior Championships (a tournament whose profile was notably raised by TSN), and the IIHF World U18 Championship. In 2020, TSN renewed its contract with Hockey Canada through the 2033–34 season.

On July 21, 2021, the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) announced that Bell Media would hold its national media rights package beginning in the 2021–22 season, with TSN holding rights to 30 regular-season games across the CHL&#x27;s leagues per-season, as well as coverage of national events such as the Memorial Cup.

From 1987 to 1998, and again from 2002 to 2014, TSN held national cable rights to broadcast the NHL in Canada. Under its most recent contract, TSN aired regular season games on weeknights and Sundays, including exclusivity on Wednesday nights, as well as various Stanley Cup playoffs games, as the league&#x27;s secondary rightsholder after CBC Sports. Its most recent contract expired at the end of the 2013–14 NHL season (following the 2014 NHL Draft); Rogers Communications (owners of Sportsnet) secured a 12-year contract for sole national rights beginning with the following season. TSN&#x27;s then-parent company CTVglobemedia attempted to strike a similar exclusive deal in 2006 ($1.4 billion over ten years), but was not successful.

CTV acquired the rights to &quot;The Hockey Theme&quot;, which has been the theme song of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; for 40 years, after the CBC decided not to renew its rights to the theme song in June 2008 amid a legal dispute with its composer, Dolores Claman. A reorchestrated version of the tune has been used for hockey broadcasts on TSN and RDS since fall 2008.

TSN continues to hold four regional, English-language rights contracts:
* Winnipeg Jets: 60 games per season beginning in 2014–15; aired regionally on TSN3.
* Toronto Maple Leafs: 26 games per season beginning in 2014–15 (indefinite due to Bell&#x27;s co-ownership of Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment; remaining regional games split with Sportsnet Ontario); aired regionally on TSN4.
* Ottawa Senators: 60 games per season beginning in 2014–15 through to the 2025–26 season; aired regionally on TSN5.
* Montreal Canadiens: 50 games beginning in 2017–18 through to the 2021–22 season, aired regionally on TSN2.

These games are subject to blackout outside the teams&#x27; designated home markets.

TSN has also occasionally broadcast the American Hockey League&#x27;s Toronto Marlies games, which are simulcast from Leafs Nation Network; as with the Maple Leafs, the Marlies are owned by MLSE.

TSN was credited for breaking reports surrounding Hockey Canada&#x27;s settlement of a 2018 sexual assault case.

=== Football ===
TSN has broadcast Canadian Football League games since 1987. Since the 2008 season, TSN has been the CFL&#x27;s exclusive broadcaster, airing all of the league&#x27;s games, including the season-ending Grey Cup. In November 2019, TSN and the CFL signed a six-year media rights extension, which was reported to expire in 2025.

The channel also previously held rights to the country&#x27;s university football playoff tournaments, including the Hardy Trophy, Uteck Bowl, Mitchell Bowl and the Vanier Cup championship. The Hardy Cup coverage reverted to Shaw TV in 2014 while the Uteck, Mitchell and Vanier contests moved to Sportsnet, who acquired exclusive rights to CIS tournaments in May 2013.

=== Basketball ===
TSN splits rights to the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Toronto Raptors with Sportsnet, by virtue of the league&#x27;s Canadian media rights being managed by Raptors owner MLSE.

TSN alternated broadcasting the 2019 NBA Finals with Sportsnet, which featured the Toronto Raptors winning their first-ever NBA championship. TSN aired the series-clinching Game 6, which saw an average of 7.7 million viewers as the most-watched NBA telecast in Canadian history.

=== Soccer ===
TSN acquired Canadian rights to Major League Soccer in 2011, airing 24 matches during the 2011 season that involved the league&#x27;s Canadian clubs, Toronto FC and Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Its slate expanded to 30 games in 2012 with the debut of the Montreal Impact in the league. TSN&#x27;s channels broadcast a package of other regular-season games, the MLS All-Star Game, MLS Cup Playoffs and the MLS Cup. In January 2014, TSN announced that it would take over broadcast rights to Whitecaps games beginning in the 2014 Major League Soccer season, under a separate deal. These rights were renewed in 2017 as TSN reached a 5-year extension to its Major League Soccer broadcasting rights. However, these exclusive rights were not renewed further (TSN Would air non-exclusive rights to select game&#x27;s beginning in 2023), as all MLS programming moved to the new MLS Season Pass streaming service in 2023.

On October 27, 2011, Bell Media and TSN announced that they had secured broadcast rights for FIFA soccer tournaments from 2015 to 2022. The rights include the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 2022 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup hosted by Canada and the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

In 2021, TSN acquired the rights to La Liga, as part of a sub-licensing agreement with ESPN.

=== Other ===
TSN holds exclusive rights to Curling Canada&#x27;s &quot;Season of Champions&quot; series through 2029, which includes Canada&#x27;s women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s national championships, the Scotties Tournament of Hearts and Montana&#x27;s Brier, along with the World Curling Championships. It also organizes the Pinty&#x27;s All-Star Curling Skins Game, an annual skins curling tournament.

TSN has hosted much of Canada&#x27;s supplementary Olympic coverage, being the first pay television channel in the world to ever broadcast the Olympics with the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, and having been part of the CBC&#x27;s coverage from 1998 to 2008. In 2010, TSN began to participate in CTV and Rogers&#x27; joint broadcast rights to the Olympic Games for 2010 and 2012. TSN continued to be a part of CBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics, but also in conjunction with Sportsnet (who participated in the CTV/Rogers coverage).

TSN has also historically been a broadcaster for Major League Baseball in Canada, as its former parent company, Labatt, was also the owner of the Toronto Blue Jays. Under Rogers ownership, TSN continued to sub-license a package 25 of Blue Jays games per-season, with the rest of the games televised by the co-owned Sportsnet, who is also the primary rightsholder of Major League Baseball in Canada. In 2010, TSN traded its Blue Jays games to Sportsnet for rights to &quot;ESPN Sunday Night Baseball&quot;. In 2014, TSN reached a deal directly with MLB International for Canadian rights to all of ESPN&#x27;s MLB coverage, adding &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; and &quot;Wednesday Night Baseball&quot; beginning in the 2014 season.

===Significant international broadcast rights===
Along with its coverage of Canadian events, TSN also airs coverage of international sporting events (primarily American), often simulcast from other broadcasters.

TSN also currently airs Formula One, NASCAR Cup Series, and NASCAR Xfinity Series events (as of the 2016 season, coverage of F1 events is supplied from Sky Sports).
As of the 2017 season, TSN serves as the exclusive cable rightsholder of the National Football League in Canada, alongside terrestrial rightsholder CTV, carrying all national game packages (including &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, and &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;), as well as Sunday afternoon games. In 2022, the NFL renewed its contract with Bell under a multi-year deal, gaining exclusive Canadian rights to &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; (as part of its move to Prime Video), and the expanded &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; schedule (including ESPN&#x27;s NFL International Series game). TSN also carries ESPN&#x27;s NFL studio programs, including &quot;NFL Live&quot;, &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot;, and &quot;Monday Night Countdown,&quot; while NFL RedZone is carried on TSN&#x27;s streaming platforms.

TSN is the exclusive rightsholder in Canada for all four Tennis Grand Slams; in 2012, the channel signed multi-year extensions for the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon., followed by the US Open the following year. In 2016, TSN also re-gained rights to non-domestic ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and ATP World Tour 500 series events. In 2020, TSN also acquired rights to WTA Tour Premier 5 and Premier Mandatory events. Both exclude the National Bank Cup due to exclusive media and sponsorship rights held by Rogers Media and Sportsnet, sold separately from other events.

TSN is also the rights holder for all four of golf&#x27;s major championships – The Masters (first two rounds, and late-round coverage on CTV beginning 2016), US Open, British Open (late-round coverage in simulcast with NBC and CTV since 2016) and PGA Championship. In addition, it carries the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup and simulcasts the RBC Canadian Open.

On December 22, 2014, it was also announced that Bell Media had acquired Canadian rights to UFC mixed martial arts, beginning in 2015. TSN&#x27;s networks air all major events, including PPV preliminaries, domestic &quot;UFC Fight Night&quot; events, and &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;. TSN also sub-licensed portions of its rights to fighting sports-oriented specialty channel Fight Network, which aired international &quot;Fight Night&quot; events and preliminaries for non-PPV events. The contract also includes French-language rights for RDS. The contract with Bell was renewed in December 2018; the Fight Network sub-licensing agreement was dropped, giving TSN rights to non-PPV preliminaries, and also adding &quot;Dana White&#x27;s Tuesday Night Contender Series&quot;. The renewal coincided with the assumption of U.S. rights to the UFC by minority partner ESPN.

Through minority owner ESPN, TSN and RDS also hold exclusive Canadian broadcast rights to several other events which ESPN either owns outright, such as the X Games, or for which it owns the worldwide broadcast rights, such as the College Football Playoff, the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship (sublicensed from ESPN International since 2011), the World Series of Poker, and its boxing coverage.

On December 19, 2014, Bell Media announced that it had acquired rights to the UEFA Champions League and Europa League for TSN and RDS beginning in 2015, with portions sub-licensed to beIN Sports. TSN lost Champions League and Europa League rights to DAZN after the 2017–18 season.

In the 2014–15 season, TSN began to broadcast a package of NCAA Division I college hockey games including regular season games (mainly simulcast from regional sports networks) and the NCAA tournament and Frozen Four (whose rights are owned by ESPN).

====Professional wrestling====
TSN previously aired WWE&#x27;s flagship show, &quot;Raw&quot;, for over a decade. Though broadcast live, the show occasionally had been censored live for extremely violent scenes (such as when female wrestlers or characters were assaulted by male wrestlers) to meet Canadian broadcast standards, with repeat broadcasts often more heavily edited. The final episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on TSN aired on July 31, 2006, after which, rival network The Score (now known as Sportsnet 360) picked up the rights.

In 2019, TSN acquired broadcast rights to All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s flagship show, &quot;Dynamite&quot;, marking the return of professional wrestling to the network. The show is broadcast in simulcast with TNT in the United States (subject to pre-emption in the event of conflicts with other programming). On August 9, 2021, PWInsider reported that TSN will stream &quot;AEW Rampage&quot; online in simulcast with the U.S. through its website and TSN Direct.

<text>Lieutenant General Watkin Tench (6 October 1758 – 7 May 1833) was a British military officer who is best known for publishing two books describing his experiences in the First Fleet, which established the first European settlement in Australia in 1788. His two accounts, &quot;Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay&quot; and &quot;Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson&quot; provide an account of the arrival and first four years of the colony.

==Early life and career==
Tench was born on 6 October 1758 at Chester in the county of Cheshire, England, a son of Fisher Tench, a dancing master who ran a boarding school in the town and Margaritta Tarleton of the Liverpool Tarletons. Watkin was a cousin to the politician Banastre Tarleton. His father appears to have named Watkin after a wealthy local landowner, Watkin Williams Wynn, whose family probably assisted in starting Tench&#x27;s military career.

Tench joined His Majesty&#x27;s Marine Forces, Plymouth division, as a second lieutenant on 25 January 1776, aged 17. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 25 January 1778 at the age of 19 years and 3 months. He fought against the American forces in their War of Independence. He was captured when was driven ashore on the Maryland coast at Assateague Island near the then extant Sinepuxent Inlet on the morning of 8 July 1778, by the French under Comte d&#x27;Estaing. Tench was in command of the Marine unit on board HMS &quot;Mermaid&quot;. He and the other officers were transported to Philadelphia, imprisoned and exchanged in October 1778.

==Colonial career==
Little more is known of him until he sailed as part of the First Fleet in 1787, although he records in Chapter 13 of the &quot;Account&quot; that he had spent time in the West Indies, and his service record shows that he was promoted to captain lieutenant in September 1782 and went on half-pay in May 1786.

===Aboard the First Fleet===
The retirement did not last long, as in October 1786 the Admiralty called for volunteers for a three-year tour with the newly forming New South Wales Marine Corps for service at Botany Bay. In December 1786, Tench&#x27;s offer to re-enter the corps was accepted. In May 1787, he sailed on the transport ship .

===In the colony of New South Wales===
Before sailing with the fleet, Tench arranged with the London publishing firm of Debrett&#x27;s to write a book, describing his experience of the journey and the first few months of the colony. In July 1788, his manuscript was taken back by John Shortland and published as the &quot;Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay&quot; by Debrett&#x27;s in 1789. It ran to three editions and was quickly translated into French, German, Dutch and Swedish.

In October 1788, Robert Ross made a list of marines who wanted to stay in Australia, either as soldiers or settlers. Tench headed the list as &quot;a soldier for one tour more of three years.&quot; Among his achievements in the fledgling colony of New South Wales Tench was being the first European to encounter the Nepean River. Tench&#x27;s accounts were influenced by the liberalism of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the idea of the noble savage. He ridicules Rousseau&#x27;s notion of the noble savage and details the colonists&#x27; treatment of Aboriginal people.

His writings include much information about the Aborigines of Sydney, the Gadigal and Cammeraygal, whom he referred to as &quot;Indians&quot;. He was friendly with Bennelong, Barangaroo and several others. He stayed in Sydney until December 1791 when he sailed home on , arriving in Plymouth in July 1792. In 1791 he studied the progress of the colony as research for his second book, visiting, among others, the farm of the convict Thomas William Parr, whom he found to have made improvements as required by the terms of the grant, and was a hard worker, but not satisfied with farming work.

==Later life==
===Back in England===
In October 1792, Tench married Anna Maria Sargent, who was the daughter of Robert Sargent, a Devonport surgeon.
In 1793, he published his &quot;Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson&quot;, which was as well-received as his first book. He joined as a brevet major, serving under Admiral Richard Rodney Bligh in the Channel fleet&#x27;s blockade of Brest.

===Napoleonic Wars===
In November 1794, Bligh surrendered HMS &quot;Alexander&quot; after the action of 6 November 1794, a hard-fought battle with three French ships. The crew were initially imprisoned on ships in Brest harbour. Later Tench and Bligh were moved to Quimper and imprisoned on parole. Bligh kept Tench close by because Tench was fluent in French. During this time, Tench wrote, but probably did not send, the letters that formed the basis of his third book, &quot;Letters written in France to a Friend in London&quot;. He was exchanged in May 1795 after being held prisoner for six months.

After returning to service, Tench served four years on , escorting convoy ships in the Atlantic and the Channel. In 1801, he rejoined the Channel blockade fleet on and remained there until his career at sea ended in 1802. After this, he appears to have taken shore posts at Chatham, Plymouth and Woolwich until he retired with the rank of major general at the end of 1815.

===Later years and death===
In October 1819, Tench was reactivated as commandant in the Plymouth division at the age of 61. Although he and his wife had no children of their own, in 1821 they took responsibility for three nephews and a niece when the four children were orphaned. At the time, Watkin Tench was 63 and his wife was 56. Watkin Tench resided in Chapel Street, Penzance, in the house constructed by Richard Oxnam&#x27;s grandfather. He lived there from 1818 until 1828.

In July 1827, Tench retired with the rank of lieutenant general. He died on 7 May 1833, in Devonport, near Plymouth, Devon, England, aged 74.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;The Watch on the Headland&quot; (1940) - radio play
* Eleanor Dark, &quot;The Timeless Land&quot; (1941 novel)
* Kate Grenville, &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; (novel) as Captain Silk
* Timberlake Wertenbaker, &quot;Our Country&#x27;s Good&quot; (1988 play). Tench is portrayed as an unsympathetic character who does not believe in any hope of redemption or rehabilitation for any of the transported English convicts of the First Fleet.

Tench Reserve in Penrith, New South Wales, is named after him, as is Watkin Tench Parade in Pemulwuy, New South Wales.

<text>The Book of Nunnaminster (London, British Library, Harley MS 2965) is a 9th-century Anglo-Saxon prayerbook. It was written in the kingdom of Mercia, using an &quot;insular&quot; hand (as used in the British Isles), related to Carolingian minuscule. It was probably later owned by Ealhswith, wife of Alfred the Great. It is related to, but of an earlier date than, the Book of Cerne, and also to the Royal Prayerbook and the Harleian prayerbook. Like Cerne it contains the Passion narratives of the four Gospels and a collection of non-liturgical prayers, many of which relate to the Passion. The Book of Nunnaminster shares some poems with the Book of Cerne. It also includes some decorated initials.

The &#x27;Nunnaminster&#x27; was another name for St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, Winchester, which is known to have employed female scribes. Some scholars have suggested that the Book of Nunnaminster may have been written by one of these female scribes because of its continual use of female pronouns in many of the prayers.

<doc id="354749" wikidata="Q1095726" url="?curid=354749" title="Clark MacGregor">
<text>Clark MacGregor (July 12, 1922 – February 10, 2003) was an American politician and Republican U.S. Representative from Minnesota&#x27;s 3rd Congressional District for five terms from 1961 to 1971.

After his time in Congress, he worked as a senior assistant to President Richard Nixon, including as chairman of the president’s successful 1972 re-election campaign.

==Life and career==
MacGregor was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and graduated cum laude from Dartmouth College in 1944 and the University of Minnesota Law School in 1946. In 1949, he married Barbara Spicer; they had three daughters. Clark and Barbara were married until his death.

===Congress===
He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1960, defeating six-term Democratic incumbent Roy Wier, and served in the 87th, 88th, 89th, 90th, and 91st congresses, January 3, 1961 – January 3, 1971.

In 1963, MacGregor appeared in a satirical revue by Dudley Riggs&#x27; Brave New Workshop.
He was a delegate to the 1964 and 1968 Republican National Convention from Minnesota. He was an unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Senator from Minnesota in 1970, losing to former Democratic Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Initially expecting to run against the incumbent senator, Eugene McCarthy, MacGregor later said privately that he would not have entered the race had he known he would be running against Humphrey.

MacGregor voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964,and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

===Nixon White House===
MacGregor was Assistant to Richard Nixon for congressional relations in 1970, Counsel to the President on congressional relations (1971–1972), Chairman of the Committee to Re-elect the President (July to November 1972) following John Mitchell&#x27;s resignation from the position in the Watergate political scandal. In October 1972, as the reporting of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein began to piece together the extent of the spying and sabotage program of the Nixon campaign, MacGregor in a press conference attacked &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for allegedly &quot;Using innuendo, third-person hearsay, unsubstantiated charges, anonymous sources, and huge scare headlines ... maliciously ... to give the appearance of a direct connection between the White House and the Watergate -- a charge the &quot;Post&quot; knows -- and a half dozen investigations have found -- to be false.&quot;

===Later career and death===
After 1973, he left politics. He continued to live in Washington, D.C., worked for United Technologies Corporation, and was on the boards of the National Symphony Orchestra and the Wolf Trap Foundation.

During a vacation in Pompano Beach, Florida in 2003, MacGregor died from respiratory failure.

<doc id="354761" wikidata="Q836408" url="?curid=354761" title="Railway stations in the Netherlands">
<text>There are currently 401 railway stations in the Netherlands including four which are used only during special events and one which serves the National Railway Museum only. NS Stations is the body which manages and owns all railway stations in the Netherlands.

==Categories==

Stations are divided into two categories based upon the service they receive. These are, in order of decreasing importance:
* Intercity stations, where usually all trains (except, in some cases, international services) call.
* The remaining stations, where only local trains (&quot;Sprinters&quot;) call.
There are exceptions to this categorization. Some local trains – despite being called &quot;stoptreinen&quot; – do not stop at all stations: two examples are the services from Groningen to Roodeschool and from Tiel to Arnhem.

On the route diagrams printed at the top of station departure sheets, intercity stations are indicated by the letters IC.

ProRail classifies stations into five categories based upon the facilities available. The categories are (in English): &quot;Cathedral&quot;, &quot;Mega&quot;, &quot;Plus&quot;, &quot;Basic&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot;.

==Naming conventions==
Stations are generally named after the town they serve. In cases where a town is served by more than one station, additional designations specify the station&#x27;s status or location, for example:
*Centraal (abbreviated &quot;CS&quot;): &quot;Central&quot; – a town&#x27;s most important station with more than 40,000 daily passengers.
*Centrum: &quot;Centre&quot; – a town&#x27;s most important station with, however, fewer than 40,000 daily passengers, and/or a centrally located station.
*Zuid: &quot;South&quot;
*Noord: &quot;North&quot;
*Oost: &quot;East&quot;
*West: &quot;West&quot;
*A specific locality within the town, e.g. Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station.

In the converse situation, where one station serves two communities, both community names are given, separated by a hyphen, e.g. Krommenie-Assendelft.

As of 15 December 2019 eight stations are designated Centraal. They are: Amsterdam Centraal, Amersfoort Centraal, Arnhem Centraal, Den Haag Centraal, Eindhoven Centraal, Leiden Centraal, Rotterdam Centraal, and Utrecht Centraal.

==List of stations, with their official abbreviations==

==Platforms and tracks==
Not the platforms, but the tracks are numbered. In Dutch communication, NS refers to &quot;spoor 1&quot; (&quot;track 1&quot;), etc. while in English communication, NS refers to &quot;platform 1&quot; where &quot;track 1&quot; is meant (hence all island platforms have two numbers). Tracks without platform access, used for through traffic, also have a number. This number is not indicated, but it shows indirectly by the fact that in the numbering of the accessible tracks a number is skipped. Track numbers are usually increasing in the direction away from the centre of the city and hence away from the main entrance(s) of the station.

A track along a long platform may have an &quot;a&quot; and a &quot;b&quot;-side, and sometimes three sections &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;.

At many stations, above platforms and at their access points, there are dynamic displays (electronic displays) of the destination and departure time of the next train

==Machines and counters for train tickets==
For checking in and out with an OV-chipkaart card readers are at station entrances, halls and/or platforms. It can be recharged (increasing the credit by paying an amount) at ticket machines. The anonymous variety of the card can also be purchased here. For some minor rail operators all this does not apply yet.

Paper tickets are available from the same ticket machines; at the counter (if available) a supplement of €0.50 per ticket (with a maximum of €1 per occasion) has to be paid. In both cases one can choose a dated or undated ticket; the latter can be useful if one has not decided yet about the travel date. If the ticket is not dated it requires a stamp from a stamp machine on the travel date.

With an e-ticket bought in advance for a specific journey one can just get on the train without any further validation of the ticket.

==NS Stations==

NS Stations is a Dutch company that manages and exploits all railway stations in the Netherlands.

==Safety and comfort==
Passenger comfort sometimes suffers from (homeless) beggars or pickpockets, especially in large cities. Measures taken to remedy this include installation of CCTV, locking waiting rooms in the evening, and sometimes removal of benches from station halls. Also, a valid train ticket is required to access platforms, at many stations enforced by gates that require an OV-chipkaart to activate them. Passengers with large luggage should note that no luggage trolleys are provided (except at the station of Schiphol airport), although platforms are accessible by elevator.

==Station abbreviations==
The official abbreviations of names of stations are used internally by the NS, but also on handwritten tickets; they can also conveniently be used when entering a station in the NS planner and are needed in some URLs, see below. In a station it can be found in the lower right corner of the yellow departure schedules. In most URLs (see below) they have to be written in lowercase, in some a capital is optional. On the departure schedules they are written in lowercase. In other cases the abbreviations are written with a capital letter.

Stations also have a four-digit code that is used on the keypad of older ticket machines to specify a destination.

The Duport is one of Stradivari&#x27;s &#x27;B Form&#x27; cellos. This form, which Stradivari first used in 1709, arose from requests by patrons for a smaller cello that was more versatile. In addition to its smaller dimensions, the B Form cellos took advantage of recent advancements in string technology and production.

== History ==
The cello was built in 1711, likely at the request of King Louis XIV&#x27;s personal physician, François Chicoyneau. When Chicoyneau died in 1752, the cello was sent to Paris to be sold by a private dealer. When this failed, the cello was put up for public auction. Cellist Jean-Louis Duport (not to be confused with his older brother Jean-Pierre), submitted a bid with the help of two friends, both of whom were princes. The auction failed, however, and the cello&#x27;s sale was eventually entrusted to private dealer George Cousineau. The Duport brothers were later contacted to see if they remained interested in the cello, and they bought it for a relatively low price.

In 1812, Jean-Louis Duport permitted Napoleon Bonaparte to handle the cello after giving a concert at the Tuileries Palace; a dent, still visible on the instrument, is said to have resulted from the emperor&#x27;s rough handling while straddling the cello with his boots. Jean-Louis Duport died in 1819 and the cello was passed to his son. Auguste-Joseph Franchomme set a price record by purchasing it for FRF25,000 in 1843 from Duport&#x27;s son. The instrument maker Jean Baptiste Vuillaume used the &quot;Duport&quot; as the primary model for his cellos.

Prior to its acquisition in 1974 by Mstislav Rostropovich, cellist Gerald Warburg was the owner. He died in 1971 and reportedly told violin dealer Etienne Vatelot that the cello should be sold only to Rostropovich and no one else. Rostropovich used a number of cellos including instruments by Goffriller and Storioni. The Duport, however, was reported to be his favorite, especially in his later years. After Rostropovich&#x27;s death the cello was initially reported in the press as purchased by the Nippon Music Foundation for $20 US million, but Rostropovich&#x27;s heirs later commented that they remained the owners of the famous cello, according to a legal representative for the family. Its exact whereabouts remain unknown, and very little if any new information has appeared about it since the disputed article in 2008.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 115, commonly referred to as Highway 115, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that connects Peterborough with Toronto via Highway 401. The highway begins at a junction with Highway 401 southwest of Newcastle and ends at an at-grade intersection with Highway 7 east of Peterborough. 

Highway 115 is part of the Algonquin Trail and is concurrent with Highway 35 from its southern terminus in Clarington to Enterprise Hill, where it veers towards Peterborough and Highway 35 continues north into the Kawarthas. It is also part of the Trans-Canada Highway from the interchange with Highway 7 south of Springville, Ontario to the northern terminus of the highway. Highway 115 is a freeway northeast of Enterprise Hill and a right-in/right-out (RIRO) expressway south of it, featuring short ramps with abrupt right turns to and from the highway. By January 2010, exit numbers were added to the freeway section north of the Highway 35 concurrency.

== Route description ==

Highway 115 begins at a trumpet interchange with Highway 401, and is concurrent with Highway 35 for to Enterprise Hill. For the length of this concurrency, it is a divided four lane RIRO expressway. Here, Highway 35/115 meets the eastern terminus of Highway 407 at a modified trumpet interchange in Clarington, and at Enterprise Hill, the expressway curves eastward and Highway 35 exits, continuing north towards Lindsay. Highway 115 continues northeast, and the two carriageways diverge, making it a freeway. A depressed grass median, generally wide, separates the opposing directions of travel between this point and Peterborough.

Most of the remainder of the highway is straight and surrounded by agricultural lands and forests, until it meets Highway 7. From this point northeastward, Highway 115 is part of the southern Ontario route of the Trans-Canada Highway and concurrent with Highway 7. The freeway continues along the southern edge of Peterborough and ends at Lansdowne Street to the east of the city. Highway 7 continues east towards Ottawa.

== History ==

Highway 115 was a new highway constructed in the mid-1950s and gradually improved over the following 40 years. Initially, the route was constructed as a two-lane connection from Highway 35 near Pontypool to Highway 28 on the outskirts of Peterborough. Because of that, it was known as the Pontypool–Peterborough Road. It was eventually extended to Highway 7 on the east side of Peterborough and later widened to a four-lane expressway in the late 1980s. Since then, improvements have been proposed to extend Highway 115 east to Highway 28, but none has come to fruition.

In 1953, construction began on a two-lane road northeastward from Highway 35 south of Pontypool, with the purpose of creating a shorter route between Toronto and Peterborough. The Pontypool–Peterborough Road, as it was referred to during construction, was completed and designated as Highway 115 on March 17, 1955, ending at an intersection with Highway 28 which became notoriously dangerous.

In 1961, Highway 115 was extended southward to the 401, becoming concurrent with Highway 35. That same year, the new &quot;Peterborough By-pass&quot; opened, providing a route for Highway 7 around the south side of the city via Monaghan Parkway. Highway 115 was later extended east to connect with the bypass, and the northern terminus became the intersection of Erskine Avenue and Lansdowne Street (the former Highway 7A). The extension was opened at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on August 25, 1978.

The entire length of the highway south of Highway 7 was widened to four lanes in the 1980s and early 1990s. Later, Highway 115 was rerouted to join Highway 7 on the newly-four-laned Peterborough By-pass route. Although Highway 115 currently meets many Ontario freeway design standards northeast of the Highway 35 interchange, there are currently no plans to re-designate this section as a 400-series highway (like Highway 415 or a non-tolled section of Highway 407).
== Exit list ==










==Service Areas==

Highway 115 has a few unofficial service areas providing food and fuel for motorists without have to travel off the highway. These target vehicles heading north to Peterborough and south to Highway 401. All have entrances and exits back onto highway.

* Esso and Mobil service stations - located next to one another on the southbound side and just north of Noone&#x27;s. Esso has Country Style donuts within On the Run; Mobil (with Convenience Store) built on site of former Coffee Time location
* Noone&#x27;s Petro Canada &amp; Orono Petro Pass - on southbound side near Concession Road 8 and also has Tim Hortons (with rest rooms) and convenience store
* Black Dog Cafe Restaurant and Lounge - northbound at Concession Road 6 with Esso service station (rest rooms for restaurant patrons)
* Esso / Petro Canada stations - southbound and northbound respectively at Concession Road 3. Esso has Country Style donuts and Petro Canada located across from Popeye&#x27;s Chicken (formerly Country Style Donuts store and has restrooms)

<text>Equality of outcome, equality of condition, or equality of results is a political concept which is central to some political ideologies and is used in some political discourse, often in contrast to the term equality of opportunity. It describes a state in which all people have approximately the same material wealth and income, or in which the general economic conditions of everyone&#x27;s lives are alike.

Achieving equal results generally entails reducing or eliminating material inequalities between individuals or households in society and usually involves a transfer of income or wealth from wealthier to poorer individuals, or adopting other measures to promote equality of condition.

One account in &quot;The Journal of Political Philosophy&quot; suggested that the term meant &quot;equalising where people end up rather than where or how they begin&quot;, but described this sense of the term as &quot;simplistic&quot; since it failed to identify what was supposed to be made equal.

== In politics ==
===Political philosophy===
According to professor of politics Ed Rooksby, the concept of equality of outcome is an important one in disputes between different political positions, since equality has overall been seen as positive and an important concept that is &quot;deeply embedded in the fabric of modern politics&quot;. Conflict between so-called haves and have-nots has happened throughout human civilization and was a focus of philosophers such as Aristotle in his treatise &quot;Politics&quot;. In political philosophy, there are differing views on whether equal outcomes are beneficial or not. One view is that there is a moral basis for equality of outcome, but that the means of achieving such an outcome can be malevolent.

Writing in the journal &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, analyst George Packer argued that &quot;inequality undermines democracy&quot; in the United States partially because it &quot;hardens society into a class system, imprisoning people in the circumstances of their birth&quot;. Packer elaborated that inequality &quot;corrodes trust among fellow citizens&quot; and compared it to an &quot;odorless gas which pervades every corner&quot; of the nation.

In his 1987 book &quot;The Passion for Equality&quot;, analyst Kenneth Cauthen suggested that there were moral underpinnings for having equal outcomes because there is a common good—which people both contribute to and receive benefits from—and therefore should be enjoyed in common. Cauthen argued that this was a fundamental basis for both equality of opportunity as well as equality of outcome.

One view is that mechanisms to achieve equal outcomes—to take a society and with unequal socioeconomic levels and force it to equal outcomes—are fraught with moral as well as practical problems since they often involve political coercion to compel the transfer.

According to one report in Britain, outcomes matter because unequal outcomes in terms of personal wealth had a strong impact on average life expectancy, such that wealthier people tended to live seven years longer than poorer people and that egalitarian nations tended to have fewer problems with societal issues such as mental illness, violence, teenage pregnancy and other social problems. Authors of the book &quot;The Spirit Level&quot; contended that &quot;more equal societies almost always do better&quot; on other measures and as a result striving for equal outcomes can have overall beneficial effects for everybody.

In his &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; (1971), philosopher John Rawls developed a &quot;second principle of justice&quot; that economic and social inequalities can only be justified if they benefit the most disadvantaged members of society. Rawls further claims that all economically and socially privileged positions must be open to all people equally. Rawls argues that the inequality between a doctor&#x27;s salary and a grocery clerk&#x27;s is only acceptable if this is the only way to encourage the training of sufficient numbers of doctors, preventing an unacceptable decline in the availability of medical care (which would therefore disadvantage everyone).

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, economist Paul Krugman agreed with Rawls&#x27; position in which both equality of opportunity and equality of outcome were linked and suggested that &quot;we should try to create the society each of us would want if we didn&#x27;t know in advance who we&#x27;d be&quot;. Krugman favored a society in which hard-working and talented people can get rewarded for their efforts, but in which there was a &quot;social safety net&quot; created by taxes to help the less fortunate. Many have suggested that a society promoting equality of opportunity will resultantly see a higher degree of equality in the outcome and that equalizing a person&#x27;s socioeconomic starting conditions will result in a meritocratic distribution of economic influence. Such is the basis for left-leaning market-based ideologies such as distributism, ordoliberalism, the Social market economy, and some forms of social democracy.
In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, commentator Julian Glover writes that equality challenges both left-leaning and right-leaning positions and suggests that the task of left-leaning advocates is to &quot;understand the impossibility and undesirability of equality&quot; while the task for right-leaning advocates was to &quot;realise that a divided and hierarchical society cannot—in the best sense of that word—be fair&quot;.

Conservatives and classical liberals criticize attempts to try to fight poverty by redistributive methods as ineffective, arguing that more serious cultural and behavioral problems lock poor people into poverty. Sometimes right-leaning positions have been criticized by left-leaning positions for oversimplifying what is meant by the term equality of outcome and for construing outcomes strictly to mean precisely equal amounts for everybody. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, commentator Ed Rooksby criticized the right&#x27;s tendency to oversimplify and suggested that serious left-leaning advocates would not construe equality to mean &quot;absolute equality of everything&quot;. Rooksby wrote that Marx favored the position described in the phrase &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; and argued that this did not imply strict equality of things, but that it meant that people required &quot;different things in different proportions in order to flourish&quot;.

American libertarians and advocates of economic liberalism such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman tend to see equality of outcome negatively and argue that any effort to cause equal outcomes would necessarily and unfortunately involve coercion by government. Friedman wrote that striving for equality of outcome leaves most people &quot;without equality and without opportunity&quot;.

One left-leaning position is that it is simplistic to define equality in strict outcomes since questions such as what is being equalized as well as huge differences in preferences and tastes and needs is considerable, therefore they ask: exactly what is being equalized? Author Mark Penn wrote that &quot;the fundamental principle of centrism in the 1990s was that people would neither be left to fend for themselves nor guaranteed equality of outcome—they would be given the tools they needed to achieve the American dream if they worked hard&quot;. On the topic of fairness, Glover writes that fairness &quot;compels no action&quot;, comparing it to an &quot;atmospheric ideal, an invisible gas, a miasma&quot; and using an expression by Winston Churchill, a &quot;happy thought&quot;. 

Bernard Shaw was one of the few socialist theorists to advocate complete economic equality of outcome right at the beginning of World War One. The vast majority of socialists view an ideal economy as one where remuneration is at least somewhat proportional to the degree of effort and personal sacrifice expended by individuals in the productive process. This latter concept was expressed by Karl Marx&#x27;s famous maxim: &quot;To each according to his contribution&quot;.

===Substantive equality===

 The substantive equality embraced by Court of Justice of the European Union focuses on equality of outcomes for group characteristics and group outcomes.

===Conflation with Marxism, socialism and communism===
The German economist and philosopher Karl Marx and his collaborator Frederick Engels are sometimes mistakenly characterized as egalitarians, and the economic systems of socialism and communism are sometimes misconstrued as being based on equality of outcome. In reality, both Marx and Engels regarded the concept of equality as a political concept and value, suited to promoting bourgeois interests, focusing their analysis on more concrete issues such as the laws of motion of capitalism and exploitation based on economic and materialist logic. Marx renounced theorizing on moral concepts and refrained from advocating principles of justice. Marx&#x27;s views on equality were informed by his analysis of the development of the productive forces in society.

Socialism is based on a principle of distribution whereby individuals receive compensation proportional to the amount of energy and labor they contribute to production (&quot;To each according to his contribution&quot;), which by definition precludes equal outcomes in income distribution. In Marxist theory, communism is based on a principle whereby access to goods and services is based on free and open access (often referred to as distribution based on one&#x27;s needs); Marx stressed free access to the articles of consumption. Hence the &quot;equality&quot; in a communist society is not about total equality or equality of outcome, but about equal and free access to the articles of consumption. Marx argued that free access to consumption would enable individuals to overcome alienation. In &quot;Critique of the Gotha Programme&quot;, Marx also took into account how some were more capable than others (such as in height, marital status, skills, etc.), furthering his point against absolute equality.

As opposed to Marxists, George Bernard Shaw, a Fabian socialist, would have socialists place more emphasis on equal distribution rather than production. He developed his ideas on economic equality (and its implications for social, democratic, legal, military, and gender concerns) in lectures and articles in the ten years following the writing of his 1905 play on poverty and power, &quot;Major Barbara&quot;, at the same time as his Fabian colleague Beatrice Webb as the primary author of the 1909 Minority Report on the Poor Law, along with her husband Sidney Webb, was proposing to abolish poverty in industrial societies by introducing what we now call the welfare state. In the 1907 preface to &quot;Major Barbara&quot;, Shaw was probably the first to argue for what he called &quot;Universal Pensions for Life&quot;, now known as universal incomes. Following major lectures on equality in 1910 and 1913, he gave his fullest exposition of economic equality in a series of six highly publicized Fabian public lectures at the end of 1914, &quot;On Redistribution of Income&quot;—a phrase, as he put it at the time, that he wanted to get into circulation. Although largely unacknowledged, most of the terms of the equality debate since (such as for example, John Rawls and many recent writers on inequality) are as outlined in some detail in Shaw&#x27;s 1914 series of lectures, where he argued for a gradual incremental process towards equal incomes, mostly by levelling-up from the bottom through union activity and labor laws, minimum and basic incomes as well as by using such mechanisms as income and wealth (inheritance) taxes to prevent incomes rising at the top. In the end, the goal would have been achieved not at absolute equality, but when any remaining income differences would not yield any significant social difference. Like the later Fabian, W. H. Tawney, who further developed the equality debate, Shaw considered equality of opportunity as obsolete without economic equality. Shaw later expanded his pre-World War One work on equality into his 1928 political treatise, &quot;The Intelligent Woman&#x27;s Guide to Socialism and Capitalism&quot;.

== Related concepts ==
Equality of outcome is often compared to related concepts of equality, particularly with equality of opportunity. Generally, most senses of the concept of equality are controversial and are seen differently by people having different political perspectives, but of all of the terms relating to equality, equality of outcome is the most controversial and contentious.

Equality of opportunity generally describes fair competition for important jobs and positions such that contenders have equal chances to win such positions, and applicants are not judged or hampered by unfair or arbitrary discrimination. It entails the &quot;elimination of arbitrary discrimination in the process of selection&quot;. The term is usually applied in workplace situations, but has been applied in other areas as well such as housing, lending, and voting rights. The essence is that job seekers have &quot;an equal chance to compete within the framework of goals and the structure of rules established&quot;, according to one view. It is generally seen as a procedural value of fair treatment by the rules.

Equality of autonomy is a relatively new concept, a sort of hybrid notion that has been developed by philosopher Amartya Sen and can be thought of as &quot;the ability and means to choose our life course should be spread as equally as possible across society&quot;. It is an equal shot at empowerment or a chance to develop up to his or her potential rather than equal goods or equal chances. In a teaching guide, equality of autonomy was explained as &quot;equality in the degree of empowerment people have to make decisions affecting their lives, how much choice and control they have given their circumstances&quot;. Sen&#x27;s approach requires &quot;active intervention of institutions like the state into people&#x27;s lives&quot; but with an aim towards &quot;fostering of people&#x27;s self-creation rather than their living conditions&quot;. Sen argued that &quot;the ability to convert incomes into opportunities is affected by a multiplicity of individual and social differences that mean some people will need more than others to achieve the same range of capabilities&quot;.

Equality of process is related to the general notion of fair treatment and can be thought of as &quot;dealing with inequalities in treatment through discrimination by other individuals and groups, or by institutions and systems, including not being treated with dignity and respect&quot;, according to one definition.

Equality of perception is an uncommonly used term meaning that &quot;person should be perceived as being of equal worth&quot;.

===Outcome versus opportunity===
Equality of outcome and equality of opportunity have been contrasted to a great extent. When evaluated in a simple context, the more preferred term in contemporary political discourse is equality of opportunity (or, meaning the same thing, the common variant &quot;equal opportunities&quot;), which the public as well as individual commentators see as the nicer or more &quot;well-mannered&quot; of the two terms. A mainstream political view is that the comparison of the two terms is valid, but that they are somewhat mutually exclusive in the sense that striving for either type of equality would require sacrificing the other to an extent and that achieving equality of opportunity necessarily brings about &quot;certain inequalities of outcome&quot;. For example, striving for equal outcomes might require discriminating between groups to achieve these outcomes; or striving for equal opportunities in some types of treatment might lead to unequal results. Equality seeking policies may also have a redistributive focus.

However, the two concepts are not always cleanly contrasted since the notion of equality is complex. Some analysts see the two concepts not as polar opposites but as highly related such that they can not be understood without considering the other term.
In a lamp assembly factory, for example, equality of outcome might mean that workers are all paid equally regardless of how many lamps of acceptable quality they make, which also implies that the workers cannot be fired for producing too few lamps of acceptable quality. This can be contrasted with a payment system such as piece work, which requires that every worker is paid a fixed amount of money per lamp of acceptable quality that the worker makes.

In contemporary political discourse, the two concepts of equality of outcome have sometimes been criticized as the &quot;politics of envy&quot; and are often seen as more &quot;controversial&quot; than equality of opportunity. One wrote that &quot;equality of opportunity is then set up as the mild-mannered alternative to the craziness of outcome equality&quot;. One theorist suggested that an over-emphasis on either type of equality can &quot;come into conflict with individual freedom and merit&quot;.

Critics of equality of opportunity note that while it is relatively easier to deal with unfairness for people with different races or genders, it is much harder to deal with the social class since &quot;one can never entirely extract people from their ancestry and upbringing&quot;. As a result, critics contend that efforts to bring fairness by equal opportunity are stymied by the difficulty of people having differing starting points at the beginning of the socio-economic competition. A person born into an upper-middle-class family will have greater advantages by the mere fact of birth than a person born into poverty.

One newspaper account criticized the discussion by politicians on the subject of equality as &quot;weasely&quot; and thought that the term was politically correct and vague. Furthermore, when comparing equality of opportunity with equality of outcome, the sense was that the latter type was &quot;worse&quot; for society. Equality of outcome may be incorporated into a philosophy that ultimately seeks equality of opportunity. Moving towards a higher equality of outcome (albeit not perfectly equal) can lead to an environment more adept at providing equality of opportunity by eliminating conditions that restrict the possibility for members of society to fulfill their potential. For example, a child born in a poor, dangerous neighborhood with poor schools and little access to healthcare may be significantly disadvantaged in his attempts to maximize use of talents, no matter how fine his work ethic. Thus even proponents of meritocracy may promote some level of equality of outcome to create a society capable of truly providing equality of opportunity.

While outcomes can usually be measured with a great degree of precision, it is much more difficult to measure the intangible nature of opportunities. That is one reason why many proponents of equal opportunity use measures of equality of outcome to judge success. Analyst Anne Phillips argued that the proper way to assess the effectiveness of the hard-to-measure concept of equality of opportunity is by the extent of the equality of outcome. Nevertheless, she described a single criterion of equality of outcome as problematic—the measure of &quot;preference satisfaction&quot; was &quot;ideologically loaded&quot; while other measures such as income or wealth were inadequate and she advocated an approach which combined data about resources, occupations and roles.

To the extent that inequalities can be passed from one generation to another through tangible gifts and wealth inheritance, some claim that equality of opportunity for children cannot be achieved without equality of outcome for parents. Moreover, access to social institutions is affected by equality of outcome and it is further claimed that rigging equality of outcome can be a way to prevent co-option of non-economic institutions important to social control and policy formation, such as the legal system, media or the electoral process, by powerful individuals or coalitions of wealthy people.

Purportedly, greater equality of outcome is likely to reduce relative poverty, leading to a more cohesive society. However, if taken to an extreme it may lead to greater absolute poverty, if it negatively affects a country&#x27;s GDP by damaging workers&#x27; sense of work ethic by destroying incentives to work harder. Critics of equality of outcome believe that it is more important to raise the standard of living of the poorest in absolute terms. Some critics additionally disagree with the concept of equality of outcome on philosophical grounds. Still others note that poor people of low social status often have a drive, hunger and ambition which ultimately lets them achieve better economic and social outcomes than their initially more advantaged rivals.

A related argument that is often encountered in education, especially in the debates on the grammar school in the United Kingdom and in the debates on gifted education in various countries, says that people by nature have differing levels of ability and initiative which result in some achieving better outcomes than others and it is, therefore, impossible to ensure equality of outcome without imposing inequality of opportunity.

<text>Jan Karski (born Jan Kozielewski, 24 June 1914 – 13 July 2000) was a Polish soldier, resistance-fighter, and diplomat during World War II. He is known for having acted as a courier in 1940–1943 to the Polish government-in-exile and to Poland&#x27;s Western Allies about the situation in German-occupied Poland. He reported about the state of Poland, its many competing resistance factions, and also about Germany&#x27;s destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto and its operation of extermination camps on Polish soil that were murdering Jews, Poles, and others.

Emigrating to the United States after the war, Karski completed a doctorate and taught for decades at Georgetown University in international relations and Polish history. He lived in Washington, D.C., until the end of his life. Karski did not speak publicly about his wartime missions until 1981 when he was invited as a speaker to a conference on the liberation of the camps. Karski was featured in Claude Lanzmann&#x27;s nine-hour film &quot;Shoah&quot; (1985), about the Holocaust, based on oral interviews with Jewish and Polish survivors. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Karski was honored by the new Polish government, other European nations, and the US for his wartime role.

==Early life==
Jan Karski was born Jan Romuald Kozielewski on 24 June 1914 in Łódź, Poland. Karski was born on St John&#x27;s Day, and named Jan (the Polish equivalent of John), following the Polish custom of naming children after the saint(s) of their birthday. His baptismal record—in error—listed 24 April as his birthdate, as Karski explained later in interviews on several occasions (see Waldemar Piasecki&#x27;s biography of Karski, &quot;One Life&quot;, as well as published interviews with his family).

Karski had two brothers and one sister. Among his sibling was , a police inspector in Warsaw. The children were raised as Catholics and Karski remained a Catholic throughout his life. His father died when he was young, and the family struggled financially. Karski grew up in a multi-cultural neighborhood, where a majority of the populace was Jewish.

After military training at the school for mounted artillery officers in Włodzimierz Wołyński, he graduated with a First in the Class of 1936 and was ordered to the 5th Regiment of Mounted Artillery, the same unit where Colonel Józef Beck, later Poland&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Minister, served.

Karski completed his diplomatic apprenticeship between 1935 and 1938 at various posts in Romania (twice), Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and joined the diplomatic service. After completing and gaining a First in Grand Diplomatic Practice, on 1 January 1939 he started work in the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

==World War II==
During the Polish September Campaign, Karski&#x27;s 5th Regiment was part of the Kraków Cavalry Brigade, under General Zygmunt Piasecki, a unit of the &quot;Armia Kraków&quot; defending the area between Zabkowice and Częstochowa. After the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski on 10 September 1939, some units, including Karski&#x27;s 1st Battery, 5th Regiment, tried to reach Hungary but were captured by the Red Army between 17 and 20 September. Karski was held prisoner in the Kozielszczyna camp (presently in Ukraine). He successfully concealed his true rank of second lieutenant and, after a uniform exchange, was identified by the NKVD commander as a private. He was transferred to the Germans as a person born in Łódź, which was incorporated into the Third Reich, and thus escaped the Katyn massacre of Polish officers by the Soviets.

===Resistance===
In November 1939 Karski was among POWs on a train bound for a POW camp in the General Government zone, a part of Poland that had not been fully incorporated into The Third Reich. He escaped and made his way to Warsaw. There he joined the SZP (&quot;Służba Zwycięstwu Polski&quot;)—the first resistance movement in occupied Europe, organized by General Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski, the predecessor to ZWZ, later the Home Army (AK).

About that time Karski (until then, Kozielewski) adopted the &quot;nom de guerre&quot;, Jan Karski, which he later made his legal name. Other names used by him during World War II included Piasecki, Kwaśniewski, Znamierowski, Kruszewski, Kucharski, and Witold. In January 1940 Karski began to organize courier missions to transport dispatches from the Polish underground to the Polish government-in-exile, then based in Paris. As a courier, Karski made several secret trips between France, Britain, and Poland. During one such mission in July 1940, he was arrested by the Gestapo in the Tatra Mountains in Slovakia. Tortured, he was transported to a hospital in Nowy Sącz, from which he was smuggled out with the help of Józef Cyrankiewicz. After a short period of rehabilitation, he returned to active service in the Information and Propaganda Bureau of the headquarters of the Polish Home Army.

In 1942, Karski was selected by Cyryl Ratajski, the Polish Government Delegate&#x27;s Office at Home, to undertake a secret mission to see prime minister Władysław Sikorski in London. Karski was to contact Sikorski and various other Polish politicians and brief them on Nazi atrocities in occupied Poland. In order to gather evidence, Karski met Bund activist Leon Feiner. He was twice smuggled by the Jewish underground into the Warsaw Ghetto in order to directly observe what was happening to Polish Jews.

My job was just to walk. And observe. And remember. The odour. The children. Dirty. Lying. I saw a man standing with blank eyes. I asked the guide: what is he doing? The guide whispered: “He’s just dying”. I remember degradation, starvation and dead bodies lying on the street. We were walking the streets and my guide kept repeating: “Look at it, remember, remember” And I did remember. The dirty streets. The stench. Everywhere. Suffocating. Nervousness.

Disguised as a Ukrainian camp guard (although in some of his writings Karski stated he was disguised as an Estonian guard, for security and political reasons) he also visited a &quot;Durchgangslager&quot; (&#x27;transit camp&#x27;) for Bełżec death camp located in the town of Izbica Lubelska, midway between Lublin and Bełżec. While Karski accurately reported the location in his initial reports, written in 1943, in his book published in the USA during the war, Karski identified the camp as the Bełżec death camp, which has led to some confusion among historians. According to Thomas Wood and Stanislaw Jankowski, Karski was initially told he was going to be taken to see Bełżec and in his book, Karski was referring to the overall system of murder centered on Bełżec rather than the camp itself.

===Reporting Nazi atrocities to the Western Allies===


Starting in 1940, Karski reported to the Polish, British, and US governments on the situation in Poland, especially on the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto and the Nazi extermination of Polish Jews. He smuggled out of Poland microfilm with further information from the underground movement on the extermination of European Jews in German-occupied Poland. His reports were transcribed and translated by Walentyna Stocker, the personal secretary and interpreter for Sikorski. Based on Karski&#x27;s microfilm, Polish Foreign Minister Count Edward Raczyński provided the Allies with one of the earliest and most accurate accounts of the Nazi Holocaust. Raczyński&#x27;s Note, addressed to the governments of the United Nations on 10 December 1942, was later published along with other documents in a widely distributed leaflet entitled &quot;The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland&quot;.

Karski met with Polish politicians in exile including the prime minister, as well as members of political parties such as the Socialist Party, National Party, Labor Party, People&#x27;s Party, Jewish Bund and Poalei Zion. He also spoke to the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, giving a detailed account of what he had seen in Warsaw and Bełżec.

Karski also traveled to the United States, where on 28 July 1943 he met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Oval Office, the first eyewitness to tell Roosevelt of the situation in Poland and the Jewish Holocaust. Roosevelt asked no questions about the Jews. Karski met with many other government and civic leaders in the United States, including Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Cordell Hull, William Joseph Donovan, and Rabbi Stephen Wise. Karski presented his report to media, bishops of various denominations (including Cardinal Samuel Stritch), members of the Hollywood film industry and artists, but without result, as most people could not comprehend the scale of extermination that he recounted. But Karski&#x27;s accounts of the problems of stateless people and their vulnerability to murder helped inspire the formation of the War Refugee Board, changing US governmental policy from neutrality to support for war refugees and civilians in Europe, and after the war, inspiring the creation of the Office of High Commissioner for Refugees.
In 1944, Karski published &quot;Courier from Poland: The Story of a Secret State&quot; (a selection was featured in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine six weeks before the book&#x27;s publication).

According to historian Adam Puławski, Karski&#x27;s main mission as a courier was to alert the government-in-exile of the conflicts within Polish underground movements. He discussed the Warsaw Ghetto liquidation as part of that account, almost incidentally. Without diminishing Karski&#x27;s contributions, Puławski notes that facts about the Holocaust were available to the Allies for at least a year and a half before Karski met with Roosevelt, thus saying that his mission was primarily to report on the Holocaust is in error.

==Life in the United States==
At the war&#x27;s end, Karski remained in the United States in Washington, D.C. He began graduate studies at Georgetown University, receiving his Ph.D. in 1952. In 1954, Karski became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

Karski taught Eastern European affairs, comparative government, and international affairs at Georgetown University for 40 years. In 1985, he published the academic study &quot;The Great Powers and Poland&quot;, based on research during a Fulbright fellowship in 1974 to his native Poland.

Karski&#x27;s 1942 report on the Holocaust and the London Polish government&#x27;s appeal to the United Nations were briefly recounted by Walter Laqueur in his history &quot;The Terrible Secret: Suppression of the Truth about Hitler&#x27;s Final Solution&quot; (1980).

Karski did not speak publicly about his wartime mission until 1981 when he was invited by activist Elie Wiesel to serve as keynote speaker at the International Liberators Conference in Washington, D.C.

French filmmaker Claude Lanzmann interviewed Karski at length in 1978, as part of his preparation for his documentary &quot;Shoah&quot;, but the film was not released until 1985. Lanzmann had asked participants not to make other public statements during that time, but Karski got a release for the conference. The nine-and-a-half hour film included a total of 40 minutes of testimony by Karski, an excerpt from the first of two days of Lanzmann interviewing Karski. It ends with Karski saying that he made his report to leaders. Lanzman later said that, on the second day of interviews, Karski recounted in detail his meetings with Roosevelt and other high US officials. Lanzman said that the tone and style of Karski&#x27;s second interview were so different, and the interview so long, that it did not fit with his vision of the film and was thus not used. Unhappy with how he was presented in the film, Karski published an article, later a book, &quot;Shoah, a Biased Vision of the Holocaust&quot; (1987), in the French journal &quot;Kultura&quot;. He argued for another documentary to include his missing testimony and also to show more of the help given to Jews by many Poles (some are now recognized by Israel as the Polish Righteous among the Nations).

Following the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, Karski&#x27;s wartime role was officially acknowledged by the new government. He was awarded the Order of the White Eagle, the highest Polish civil decoration, and the Order Virtuti Militari, the highest military decoration awarded for bravery in combat.

In 1994, E. Thomas Wood and Stanisław M. Jankowski published a biography, &quot;Karski: How One Man Tried to Stop the Holocaust&quot;. They noted that Karski had urged the production of another documentary to correct what he thought was the bias in Lanzmann&#x27;s &quot;Shoah.&quot;

During an interview with Hannah Rosen in 1995, Karski discussed the Allies&#x27; failure to rescue most of the Jews from mass murder:
It was easy for the Nazis to kill Jews, because they did it. The Allies considered it impossible and too costly to rescue the Jews, because they didn&#x27;t do it. The Jews were abandoned by all governments, church hierarchies and societies, but thousands of Jews survived because thousands of individuals in Poland, France, Belgium, Denmark, Holland helped to save Jews. Now, every government and church says, &quot;We tried to help the Jews&quot;, because they are ashamed, they want to keep their reputations. They didn&#x27;t help, because six million Jews perished, but those in the government, in the churches they survived. No one did enough.

The documentary film &quot;My Mission&quot; (1997), directed by Waldemar Piasecki and Michal Fajbusiewicz, presented the full details of Karski&#x27;s wartime mission. In 1999, Piasecki published &quot;Tajne Panstwo&quot; (&quot;Secret State&quot;, edited and adapted from Karski&#x27;s wartime book), which became a bestseller. In the same year, the Museum of the City of Łódź opened &quot;Jan Karski&#x27;s Room&quot;, displaying memorabilia, documents, and decorations, all organized under Karski&#x27;s supervision.

==After Karski&#x27;s death==
In 2010, French author Yannick Haenel published a novel &quot;Jan Karski&quot;, drawn from the courier&#x27;s World War II activities and memoir. Haenel also added a third part in which he inserted his own views into Karski&#x27;s &quot;character&quot;, particularly in his approach to Karski&#x27;s meeting with President Roosevelt and other US leaders. Claude Lanzmann criticized the author strongly and argued that Haenel ignored important historic elements of the time. Haenel said that was part of his freedom in fiction.

In response, Lanzmann released the second half of his interview with Karski as a 49-minute documentary in 2010, edited and entitled &quot;The Karski Report&quot;, also on ARTE. It is mostly about Karski&#x27;s meeting with President Roosevelt and other American leaders.

Karski&#x27;s wartime book was re-published posthumously by Georgetown University Press as &quot;My Report to the World: The Story of a Secret State&quot; (2013). A Tribute to Jan Karski panel discussion was held at the university that year in conjunction with the book&#x27;s release. It featured a discussion of Karski&#x27;s legacy by School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster, Georgetown University Board Chair Paul Tagliabue, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, Polish Ambassador Ryszard Schnepf, and Rabbi Harold S. White.

==Personal life==
Karski had several siblings, mostly brothers: Marian, Boguslaw, Cyjrian, Edmund, Stefan, and Uzef and a sister Laura.

Karski&#x27;s eldest brother, Marian Kozielewski (b. 1898), reached the rank of colonel in the military and was also considered a hero in World War II. He had been arrested by the Germans in Warsaw in 1940 and was among Catholic Poles who survived being imprisoned as political prisoners at Auschwitz concentration camp. After being released in 1941, he returned to Warsaw and joined the resistance. The Kozielewski brothers admired Jozef Pilsudski and members of the &quot;forgotten army&quot;, who had suffered many deeply personal wounds. After the war, Marian emigrated initially to Canada, where he married. He struggled as a refugee, holding low-level jobs after settling in Washington, D.C., in 1960 near his brother Jan. Marian Kozielewski committed suicide there in 1964 and is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery.

In 1965, Karski married Pola Nireńska, a 54-year-old Polish Jew who was a dancer and choreographer. With the exception of her parents, who had emigrated to Israel in 1939 shortly before the Nazi invasion of Poland, all of her family had been murdered in the Holocaust. She committed suicide in 1992.

Karski died of unspecified heart and kidney disease in Washington, D.C., in 2000. He died at Georgetown University Hospital. He was interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, next to the graves of his wife, Pola Nirenska, and brother Marian. He and Pola had no children.

==Honors and legacy==


On 2 June 1982, Yad Vashem recognised Jan Karski as Righteous Among the Nations. A tree bearing a memorial plaque in his name was planted that same year at Yad Vashem&#x27;s Avenue of the Righteous Among the Nations in Jerusalem.

In 1991, Karski was awarded the Wallenberg Medal of the University of Michigan. Statues honoring Karski have been placed in New York City at the corner of 37th Street and Madison Avenue (renamed as &quot;Jan Karski Corner&quot;) and on the grounds of Georgetown University in Washington, DC. Additional benches, which were made by the Kraków-based sculptor Karol Badyna, are located in Kielce, Łódź, and Warsaw in Poland, and on the campus of Tel Aviv University in Israel. The talking Karski bench in Warsaw near the Museum of the History of Polish Jews has a button to activate a short talk by Karski about the war. Georgetown University, Oregon State University, Baltimore Hebrew College, Warsaw University, Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, and the University of Łódź all awarded Karski honorary doctorates.

In 1994, Karski was made an honorary citizen of Israel in honor of his efforts on behalf of Polish Jews during the Holocaust. Karski was nominated for the Nobel Prize and formally recognized by the UN General Assembly shortly before his death.

Shortly after his death, the Jan Karski Society was established, initiated by his close friend, collaborator and biographer, Professor Waldemar Piasecki. The society preserves his legacy and administers the Jan Karski Eagle Award, which he established in 2000. The list of laureates includes: Elie Wiesel, Shimon Peres, Lech Walesa, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Bronisław Geremek, Jacek Kuroń, Adam Michnik, Karol Modzelewski, Oriana Fallaci, Dagoberto Valdés Hernández, Stanisław Dziwisz, &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot; magazine, the Hoover Institution, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

After Karski&#x27;s death, his estate was involved in a legal dispute with YIVO over a legacy gift that Karski made. The Maryland Court of Appeals (now known as the Supreme Court of Maryland) settled the dispute.

In April 2011, the Jan Karski US Centennial Campaign was created to increase interest in the life and legacy of the late Polish diplomat, as the centennial year of his birth in 2014 approached. In November 2012, having met its major goals, the Jan Karski US Centennial Campaign was succeeded by the Jan Karski Educational Foundation, which continues to promote Karski&#x27;s legacy and values. The president of the foundation is Polish-American author Wanda Urbanska. The foundation sponsored three major conferences about Karski in his centennial birth year, at Georgetown University in Washington, at Loyola University in Chicago, and in Warsaw.

The campaign group was seeking to obtain the Presidential Medal of Freedom for Karski in advance of his anniversary. In addition, they wanted to promote educational activities, including workshops, artistic performances, and a reprint of his 1944 book, &quot;Story of a Secret State&quot;. In December 2011, the support of 68 US Representatives and 12 US Senators was obtained and a supporting nomination for the medal was submitted to the White House. On 23 April 2012, US President Barack Obama announced that Karski would receive the country&#x27;s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The medal was awarded posthumously by President Obama on 29 May 2012 and presented to Adam Daniel Rotfeld, the former Foreign Minister of Poland and himself a Jewish Holocaust survivor. Jan Karski&#x27;s family was not invited to the presentation ceremony, which they strongly protested. The medal, along with other honors given to Karski, is on display at the &quot;Karski office&quot; in Łódź Museum. This is in accordance with the wishes of his surviving family, led by his niece and goddaughter Dr. Kozielewska-Trzaska.

A controversy erupted when a misspoken word in Barack Obama&#x27;s Presidential Medal of Freedom speech came to be known as &quot;Gafa Obamy&quot; or &#x27;Obama&#x27;s gaffe&#x27;, when the president referred to &quot;a Polish death camp&quot; instead of &quot;a death camp in Poland&quot; when talking of the Nazi German transit death camp that Karski had visited. &quot;Polish death camps&quot; is a term often used to refer to Nazi concentration camps in Poland, as opposed to (as may be implied) Polish concentration camps. The terms &quot;Polish death camp&quot; or &quot;Polish concentration camp&quot; reportedly originated with ex-Nazis working for the West German secret services. Historian Leszek Pietrzak explains the propaganda strategies from the 1950s. President Obama later characterized his term as a misstatement and his characterization was accepted by Polish President Bronisław Komorowski.

In early February 2014, the Jan Karski Society and the Karski family appealed to President of Poland Bronisław Komorowski to posthumously promote Jan Karski to the rank of brigadier general in recognition of his contribution to the war effort as well as all couriers and emissaries of the underground Polish state. The appeal received no response for a year. Member of the Polish parliament Professor Tadeusz Iwiński recently openly criticized the president of Poland for inaction on Karski&#x27;s behalf.

On 24 June 2014, the &quot;Jan Karski Mission Accomplished&quot; Conference took place in Lublin under the patronage of Professor Elie Wiesel, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, President of Poland (1995–2005), Moshe Kantor, President of the European Jewish Congress, and Michael Schudrich, Chief Rabbi of Poland.

In November 2018, a new street connecting the South Bay Mall to the Polish Triangle neighborhood of Dorchester, Boston in Massachusetts was named Jan Karski Way after consulting with the Polish-American Club of Boston.

==Remembrance==
Former Foreign Minister of Poland Władysław Bartoszewski, in his speech at the ceremony of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, 27 January 2005, said: &quot;The Polish resistance movement kept informing and alerting the free world to the situation. In the last quarter of 1942, thanks to the Polish emissary Jan Karski and his mission, and also by other means, the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States were well informed about what was going on in Auschwitz-Birkenau.&quot;

A full-length play on Karski&#x27;s life and mission, &quot;Coming to See Aunt Sophie&quot; (2014), written by Arthur Feinsod, was produced in Germany and Poland. An English translation was produced in Bloomington, Indiana at the Jewish Theatre in June 2015, and in Australia in August of that year.

A new play, &quot;My Report to the World&quot;, written by Clark Young and Derek Goldman, premiered at Georgetown University during the conference honoring Karski&#x27;s centennial year. It starred Oscar-nominated actor David Strathairn as Karski. It was performed in Warsaw before being produced in New York in July 2015; Strathairn played the Karski role in all productions. Goldman directed the play in both Washington DC and New York. The July performances were presented in partnership with The Museum of Jewish Heritage, The Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics at Georgetown University, Bisno Productions, and the Jan Karski Educational Foundation.

<doc id="354814" wikidata="Q4383407" url="?curid=354814" title="Richard Neustadt">
<text>Richard Elliott Neustadt (June 26, 1919 – October 31, 2003) was an American political scientist specializing in the United States presidency. He served as adviser to several presidents. His book &quot;Presidential Power&quot; has been described as &quot;one of the most influential books ever written about political leadership.&quot; &quot;Thinking In Time: The Uses Of History For Decision Makers&quot; won the Grawemeyer Award. His other books include &quot;Alliance Politics&quot;, &quot;Preparing to be President&quot;, and, with Harvey V. Fineberg, &quot;The Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease&quot;.

==Early life==
Neustadt was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Elizabeth (Neufeld) and Richard Mitchells Neustadt, who was a progressive activist and social worker. His family were Jews whose ancestors were from Central Europe. Neustadt received a BA in History from the University of California, Berkeley in 1939, followed by an M.A. degree from Harvard University in 1941. After a short stint as an economist in the Office of Price Administration, he joined the US Navy in 1942, where he was a supply officer in the Aleutian Islands; Oakland, California; and Washington. He then went into the Bureau of the Budget (now known as the Office of Management and Budget) while he was working on his Harvard Ph.D., which he received in 1951.

==Political career==

Neustadt was the special assistant of the White House Office from 1950 to 1953 under President Harry S. Truman. During the following year, he was a professor of public administration at Cornell and, from 1954 to 1964, taught government at Columbia University, where he received a Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award in 1961.

It was at Columbia that Neustadt wrote the book &quot;Presidential Power: The Politics of Leadership&quot; (1960) in which he examined the decision-making process at the highest levels of government. He argued that the President is actually rather weak in the US government; is unable to effect significant change without the approval of the Congress; and in practice must rely on a combination of personal persuasion, professional reputation &quot;inside the Beltway,&quot; and public prestige to get things done. A revised edition titled &quot;Presidential Power and the Modern Presidents: The Politics of Leadership from Roosevelt to Reagan&quot; appeared in 1990.

With his book appearing just before the election of John F. Kennedy, Neustadt soon found himself in demand by the president-elect, and began his advisory role with a 20-page memo suggesting things the President should and should not try to do at the beginning of his term. Neustadt was an official advisor to Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, and an unofficial advisor to Bill Clinton.
A class that Neustadt taught on the presidency influenced Al Gore to change his major from English to politics and study with Neustadt.

Neustadt was a professor at Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard, where he taught as a popular professor for more than two decades and officially retired in 1989 but continued to teach there for years thereafter. Neustadt also served as the first director of the Harvard Institute of Politics (IOP), which was founded as &quot;a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy that engages young people in politics and public service&quot;. After his retirement, he served as chairman of the Presidential Debates Commission.

Neustadt was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1964 and the American Philosophical Society in 1967.

Neustadt was a recipient of the 1988 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for &quot;Thinking In Time : The Uses Of History For Decision Makers&quot; and its ideas for improving world order, co-authored with Ernest R. May.

Neustadt was hired by the then-secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph A. Califano Jr. to write a book analyzing the decision making that led to the swine flu vaccine debacle in the mid-1970s. Neustadt&#x27;s co-author, his graduate assistant Harvey V. Fineberg, said later that the book was written as a private document for Califano, who later insisted on publishing it as &quot;The Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease&quot;. The book placed blame for the swine flu vaccine decision on the CDC Director David Sencer, though Sencer&#x27;s recommendations were appropriate, given the information available at the time.

==Personal life==
His first wife, Bertha Cummings &quot;Bert&quot; Neustadt, died in 1984. In 1987, he married the British politician Shirley Williams, who also served on the faculty at the Kennedy School of Government as Professor of Electoral Politics.

Neustadt died in London after complications from a fall. In addition to Shirley Williams, Neustadt left a daughter, Elizabeth, and a granddaughter. His son, Richard, predeceased him in 1995.

<doc id="354821" wikidata="Q954213" url="?curid=354821" title="Taqiyya">
<text>In Islam, Taqiyya () is the practice of dissimulation and secrecy of religious belief and practice, primarily in Shia Islam. 

Generally, taqiyya is regarded as the action of maintaining secrecy or mystifying one&#x27;s beliefs when one&#x27;s life or property is threatened. Hiding one&#x27;s beliefs in non-Muslim nations has been practiced since the early days of Islam and early Muslims used it to avoid torture or getting killed by non-Muslims and tyrants with authority; it used to be acknowledged by Muslims of virtually all persuasions. 

The use of taqiyya has varied in recent history, especially between Sunni and Shia Muslims. Sunni Muslims gained political supremacy over time and therefore only occasionally found the need to practice taqiyya. On the other hand, Shia Muslims, as well as Sufi Muslims developed taqiyya as a method of self-preservation and protection in hostile environments.

A related term is kitmān (lit. &quot;action of covering, dissimulation&quot;), which has a more specific meaning of dissimulation by silence or omission. This practice is emphasized in Shi&#x27;ism whereby adherents are permitted to conceal their beliefs when under threat of persecution or compulsion. 

 was initially practiced under duress by some of Muhammad&#x27;s companions. Later, it became important for Sufis, but even more so for Shias, who often experienced persecution as a religious minority. In Shia theology, is permissible in situations where life or property are at risk and whereby no danger to religion would occur. has also been politically legitimised in Twelver Shi&#x27;ism, to maintain unity among Muslims and fraternity among Shia clerics.

==Etymology and related terms==
===Taqiyya===
The term &quot;taqiyya&quot; is derived from the Arabic triliteral root &quot;wāw-qāf-yā&quot; denoting &quot;caution, fear&quot;, &quot;prudence, guarding against (a danger)&quot;, &quot;carefulness, wariness&quot;. In the sense of &quot;prudence, fear&quot; it can be used synonymously with the terms &quot;tuqa(n)&quot;, &quot;tuqāt&quot;, &quot;taqwá&quot;, and &quot;ittiqāʾ&quot;, which are derived from the same root. These terms also have other meanings. For example, the term taqwá generally means &quot;piety&quot; (lit. &quot;fear [of God]&quot;) in an Islamic context.

=== &quot;Kitmān&quot; ===
A related term is &quot;kitmān&quot; (), the &quot;action of covering, dissimulation&quot;. While the terms taqiyya and kitmān may be used synonymously, kitmān refers specifically to the concealment of one&#x27;s convictions by silence or omission. Kitman derives from Arabic &quot;katama&quot; &quot;to conceal, to hide&quot;. Ibadis used kitmān to conceal their Muslim beliefs in the face of persecution by their enemies.

==Quranic basis==
The technical meaning of the term &quot;taqiyya&quot; is thought to be derived from the Quranic reference to religious dissimulation in Sura 3:28:

The two words &quot;tattaqū&quot; (&quot;you fear&quot;) and &quot;tuqāt&quot; &quot;in fear&quot; are derived from the same root as &quot;taqiyya&quot;, and the use of &quot;taqiyya&quot; about the general principle described in this passage is first recorded in a Qur&#x27;anic gloss by Muhammad al-Bukhari in the 9th century.

Regarding 3:28, ibn Kathir writes, &quot;meaning, except those believers who in some areas or times fear for their safety from the disbelievers. In this case, such believers are allowed to show friendship to the disbelievers outwardly, but never inwardly.&quot; He quotes the Companion of the Prophet Abu al-Darda, who said &quot;we smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them,&quot; and Hasan ibn Ali, who said, &quot;the tuqyah is acceptable till the Day of Resurrection.&quot;

A similar instance of the Qur&#x27;an permitting dissimulation under compulsion is found in 
Sunni and Shia commentators alike observe that verse 16:106 refers to the case of &#x27;Ammar b. Yasir, who was forced to renounce his beliefs under physical duress and torture.

==Sunni Islam view==

The basic principle of taqiyya is agreed upon by scholars, though they tend to restrict it to dealing with non-Muslims and when under compulsion (&quot;ikrāh&quot;), while Shia jurists also allow it in interactions with Muslims and in all necessary matters (&quot;ḍarūriyāt&quot;). In Sunni jurisprudence protecting one&#x27;s belief during extreme or exigent circumstances is called &quot;idtirar&quot; (), which translates to &quot;being forced&quot; or &quot;being coerced&quot;, and this word is not specific to concealing the faith; for example, under the jurisprudence of &quot;idtirar&quot; one is allowed to consume prohibited food (e.g. pork) to avoid starving to death. Additionally, denying one&#x27;s faith under duress is &quot;only at most permitted and not under all circumstances obligatory&quot;. 

Al-Tabari comments on sura XVI, verse 106 (Tafsir, Bulak 1323, xxiv, 122): &quot;If any one is compelled and professes unbelief with his tongue, while his heart contradicts him, in order to escape his enemies, no blame falls on him, because God takes his servants as their hearts believe.&quot; This verse was recorded after Ammar Yasir was forced by the idolaters of Mecca to recant his faith and denounce the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Al-Tabari explains that concealing one&#x27;s faith is only justified if the person is in mortal danger, and even then martyrdom is considered a noble alternative. If threatened, it would be preferable for a Muslim to migrate to a more peaceful place where a person may practice their faith openly, &quot;since God&#x27;s earth is wide.&quot; In Hadith, in the Sunni commentary of Sahih al-Bukhari, known as the Fath al-Bari, it is stated that:
Which translates to: 

Al-Ghazali wrote in his &quot;The Revival of the Religious Sciences&quot;: 

Ibn Sa&#x27;d, in his book &quot;al-Tabaqat al-Kubra&quot;, narrates on the authority of Ibn Sirin:

Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti, in his book &quot;al-Ashbah Wa al-Naza&#x27;ir&quot;, affirms that:

Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti, in his book &quot;al-Durr al-Manthoor Fi al-Tafsir al- Ma&#x27;athoor&quot;, narrates that:

The practice of taqiyya is not limited to any one sect within Islam. It is observed and referenced in Sunni texts of law, hadith collections, and Quranic exegesis. Although historically more extensively practiced and referenced by Shii Muslims, taqiyya is doctrinally available to Sunni Muslims as well. This challenges the negative notion that taqiyya is exclusively associated with one community or confined to a specific group.

=== &quot;Niyya&quot; ===
In Sunni Islamic law, as in Islamic law in general, the concept of intention (&quot;niyya&quot;) holds great importance. Merely performing an act without the right intention is considered insufficient. A fatwa issued by Ibn Abi Juma highlights the significance of one&#x27;s inner state and intention in determining their identity as a Muslim. According to this fatwa, if &quot;taqiyya&quot; is practiced with the right intention, it is not considered sinful but rather a pious act. The fatwa emphasizes that God values the intention of believers over their outward actions, and taqiyya can be seen as a form of outward expression aligned with the correct intention.

===Examples===

When Mamun became caliph (813 AD), he tried to impose his religious views on the status of the Qur&#x27;an over all his subjects, in an ordeal called the mihna, or &quot;inquisition&quot;. His views were disputed, and many of those who refused to follow his views were imprisoned, tortured, or threatened with the sword. Some Sunni scholars chose to affirm Mamun&#x27;s view that the Qur&#x27;an was created, in spite of their beliefs, though a notable exception to this was scholar and theologian Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who chose to endure torture instead.

Following the end of the &quot;Reconquista&quot; of the Iberian Peninsula in 1492, Muslims were persecuted by the Catholic Monarchs and forced to convert to Christianity or face expulsion. The principle of taqiyya became very important for Muslims during the Inquisition in 16th-century Spain, as it allowed them to convert to Christianity while remaining crypto-Muslims, practicing Islam in secret. In 1504, Ubayd Allah al-Wahrani, a Maliki mufti in Oran, issued a fatwā allowing Muslims to make extensive use of concealment to maintain their faith. This is seen as an exceptional case, since Islamic law prohibits conversion except in cases of mortal danger, and even then requires recantation as quickly as possible, and al-Wahrani&#x27;s reasoning diverged from that of the majority of earlier Maliki Faqīhs such as Al-Wansharisi.

==Shia Islam view==
Minority Shi‘a communities, since the earliest days of Islam, were often forced to practice pious circumspection (&quot;taqiyya&quot;) as an instinctive method of self-preservation and protection, an obligatory practice in the lands which became known as the realm of pious circumspection (&quot;dār al-taqiyya&quot;). Therefore, the recurring theme is that during times of danger feigning disbelief is allowed.

Two primary aspects of circumspection became central for the Shi‘a: not disclosing their association with the Imams when this could put them in danger and protecting the esoteric teachings of the Imams from those who are unprepared to receive them. While in most instances, minority Shi‘a communities employed &quot;taqiyya&quot; using the façade of Sunnism in Sunni-dominated societies, the principle also allows for circumspection as other faiths. For instance, Gupti Ismaili Shi‘a communities in the Indian subcontinent circumspect as Hindus to avoid caste persecution. In many cases, the practice of &quot;taqiyya&quot; became deeply ingrained into practitioners&#x27; psyche. If a believer wished, he/she could adopt this practice at moments of danger, or as a lifelong process.

=== Prudential &quot;Taqiyya&quot; ===
Kohlberg has coined the expression “prudential &quot;taqiyya&quot;” to describe caution due to fear of external enemies. It can be further categorized into two distinct forms: concealment and dissimulation.

For instance, historical accounts narrate how some Imams concealed their identities as a protective measure. In one story, the Imam Jafar al-Sadiq commended the behavior of a follower who chose to avoid direct interaction with the Imam, even though he recognized him on the street, rather than exposing him, and even cursed those who would call him by his name.

Kohlberg identifies the second type of prudential &quot;taqiyya&quot; as dissimulation, characterized by using deceptive words or actions intended to mislead opponents. It is typically employed by individuals possessing secret information. It is not solely confined to Imami Shi&#x27;ism but has been observed among various Muslim individuals or groups with minority views. During times of danger, the recurring theme is that &quot;taqiyya&quot; permits individuals to utter words of disbelief as a means of self-preservation. Prudential &quot;taqiyya&quot; is considered essential for safeguarding the faith and may be lifted when the political climate no longer poses a threat. Therefore, one way to discern the motivation behind a specific type of &quot;taqiyya&quot; is to determine whether it ceases once the danger has subsided.

=== Non-prudential &quot;Taqiyya&quot; ===
Kohlberg coined the expression “non-prudential &quot;taqiyya&quot;” for when there is a need to conceal secret doctrines from the uninitiated. Non-prudential &quot;taqiyya&quot; is employed by believers when they possess secret knowledge and are obligated to conceal it from those who have not attained the same level of initiation. This hidden knowledge encompasses diverse aspects, including profound insights into specific Quranic verses, interpretations of the Imam&#x27;s teachings, and specific religious obligations. The obligation to conceal arises when individuals acquire such exclusive knowledge emphasizing the importance of preserving its secrecy within the initiated community.

===Twelver Shia view===

If coupled with mental reservation, religious dissimulation is considered lawful in Twelver Shi&#x27;ism whenever life or property is at serious risk. In Twelver theology, also refers to hiding or safeguarding the esoteric teachings of Shia imams, a practice intended to “protect the truth from those not worthy of it.” This esoteric knowledge (of God), taught by imams to their (true) followers, is said to distinguish them from other Muslims.

Historically, the Twelver doctrine of was developed by Muhammad al-Baqir (), the fifth of the twelve imams, and later by his successor, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq (). At the time, this doctrine was likely intended for the survival of Shia imams and their followers, for they were being brutally molested and persecuted. Indeed, is particularly relevant to Twelver Shias, for until about the sixteenth century they lived mostly as a minority among an often-hostile Sunni majority. Traditions attributed to Shia imams thus encourage their followers to hide their faith for their safety, some even characterizing as a pillar of faith.
Theological and legal statements of Shia imams were also influenced by . For instance, al-Baqir is not known to have publicly reviled the first two caliphs, namely, Abu Bakr and Umar, most likely because the imam exercised . Indeed, al-Baqir&#x27;s conviction that the Islamic prophet had explicitly designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor implies that Abu Bakr and Umar were usurpers. More generally, whenever contradictory statements are attributed to Shia imams, those that are aligned with Sunni positions are discarded, for Shia scholars argue that such statements must have been uttered under .

===Ismaili Shia view===

For the Ismailis in the aftermath of the Mongol onslaught of the Alamut state in 1256 CE, the need to practice taqiyya became necessary, not only for the protection of the community itself, which was now stateless, but also for safeguarding the line of the Nizari Ismaili Imamate during this period of unrest. Accordingly, the Shia Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq stated &quot;Taqiyya is my religion and the religion of my ancestors&quot;, a tradition recorded in various sources including &quot;Kitāb al-Maḥāsin&quot; of Aḥmad b. Muhammad al-Barqī and the &quot;Da‘ā’im al-Islām&quot; of al-Qāḍī al-Nu‘mān. 

Such periods in which the Imams are concealed are known as &quot;satr&quot;, however the term may also refer to times when the Imams were not physically hidden from view but rather when the community was required to practice precautionary dissimulation. During &quot;satr&quot; the Imam could only be accessed by his community and in extremely dangerous circumstances, would be accessible only to the highest-ranking members of the Ismaili hierarchy (ḥudūd), whose function it was to transmit the teachings of the Imam to the community. Shi&#x27;a Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq is reputed to have said, &quot;Our teaching is the truth, the truth of the truth; it is the exoteric and the esoteric, and the esoteric of the esoteric; it is the secret and the secret of a secret, a protected secret, hidden by a secret.&quot; The Fatimid Imam-Caliph al-Hakim expresses the sentiment of &quot;taqiyya&quot; when he confides to his followers that &quot;if any religion is stronger than you, follow it, but keep me in your hearts.&quot;

According to Shia scholar Muhammad Husain Javari Sabinal, Shiism would not have spread at all if not for taqiyya, referring to instances where Shia have been ruthlessly persecuted by the Sunni political elite during the Umayyad and Abbasid empires. Indeed, for the Ismailis, the persistence and prosperity of the community today owes largely to the careful safeguarding of the beliefs and teachings of the Imams during the Ilkhanate, the Safawid dynasty, and other periods of persecution. The 16th century Ismaili author Khwāja Muḥammad Riḍā b. Sulṭān Ḥusayn, also known as Khayrkhvah-i Harati, referring to the Anjudan period, writes about the end of an era of &quot;taqiyya&quot;. He explains that thus far &quot;a veil was drawn over the visage of truth,&quot; but now the Imam &quot;allowed the veil to be lifted&quot;. Since the Imam had allowed written correspondence with his followers, he had effectively ended the era of &quot;taqiyya&quot;.

The Gupti community viewed the Aga Khan III as their spiritual leader and Imam, but concealed these beliefs to protect themselves. However, the Guptis used a unique form of taqiyya, they did not appear as Sunni, Sufi, or Ithna ashari, which were the more common identities to take on. Rather they identified as Hindus, and this became a significant aspect of who they were. The Guptis view their &quot;taqiyya&quot; as a fulfillment and culmination of their outwardly professed faith, rather than contrary to it. The name ‘Gupta’ in Sanskrit, means secret or hidden, which perfectly embodies the concealment of their faith and true identity.

===Alawite view===
Alawite beliefs have never been confirmed by their modern religious authorities. Alawites tend to conceal their beliefs (&quot;taqiyya&quot;) due to historical persecution. Some tenets of the faith are secret, known only to a select few; therefore, they have been described as a mystical sect. Alawites celebrate Islamic festivals but consider the most important one to be Eid al-Ghadir.

===Druze view===
Because of the Druze&#x27;s Ismaili Shia origin, they have also been associated with taqiyya. When the Druze were a minority being persecuted they took the appearance of another religion externally, usually the ruling religion in the area, and for the most part adhered to Muslim customs by this practice.

==Contemporary debate==
In the early 21st century, taqiyya has become the subject of debate. According to S. Jonathon O&#x27;Donnell, some theories posit &quot;the idea that Muslims have a religious duty to deceive non-Muslims if it furthers the cause&quot; of Islam. He argues the &quot;claim rests on a misreading of the concept of &quot;taqiyya&quot;, by which believers may conceal their faith if under threat of violence. This misreading is widely deployed in Islamophobic writings.&quot; The term has been used by writers and counter-jihadists such as Patrick Sookhdeo, who posit that Muslims use the doctrine as a key strategy in the Islamization of Western countries by hiding their true violent intents.

In 2008 Raymond Ibrahim published in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Islamic Affairs Analyst&quot; an article titled &quot;Islam&#x27;s doctrines of deception&quot;. Ibrahim presented his own translation of part of Lebanese Druze scholar Sami Makarem&#x27;s monograph &quot;Al Taqiyya Fi Al Islam&quot; (&quot;Dissimulation in Islam&quot;). Ibrahim quoted:

Michael Ryan, also in &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot;, characterized Ibrahim&#x27;s article as &quot;well-researched, factual in places but ... ultimately misleading&quot;. Ibrahim responded in 2009 with &quot;Taqiyya Revisited: A Response to the Critics&quot;, on his blog and on the Middle East Forum website. Ibrahim was again criticised for his view on Taqiyya in 2019, by Islamic scholar Usama Hasan in the &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot;. Ibrahim also responded to Hasan in a FrontPage Magazine article titled &quot;Taqiyya Sunset: Exposing the Darkness Shrouding Islamic Deceit.&quot;

Stefan Wimmer argues that taqiyya is not a tool to deceive non-Muslims and spread Islam, but instead a defensive mechanism to save one&#x27;s life when it is in great danger (giving the example of the Reconquista). Similar views are shown by Jakob Skovgaard-Petersen from the University of Copenhagen.

<text>Flavius Fravitta (Greek: ; died 404/405) was a leader of the Goths and a top-ranking officer in the army of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Fravitta was a member of the Thervingi aristocracy. He was also a pagan, and for this reason he was praised by Eunapius, a Greek historian of the 4th–5th centuries.

In 382, the Visigoths had signed a treaty with Roman Emperor Theodosius I, according to which the Visigoths were allowed to live in the Roman territory at the mouth of the Danube, with the rank of &quot;foederati&quot;, thus providing the Roman army with troops. However, within the Goths there were two parties, which grew more and more hostile to each other. One was formed by the Arian Christian majority, the &quot;Gothic party&quot;, led by Eriulf and opposed to the assimilation of the Goths in the Roman culture. Fravitta, on the other side, led those Goths who wanted to stay faithful to the treaty and who wanted to be assimilated. In 391, while Eriulf and Fravitta were both dining with Theodosius, they quarreled, and Fravitta killed Eriulf, and only the intervention of the imperial guards saved him from the vengeful followers of Eriulf; while his support among the Goths decreased, his position at court was strengthened.

Later he married a Roman woman of high rank, thus helping his own assimilation into Roman society, as well as his people&#x27;s. According to Eunapius, Fravitta required special permission from the Emperor Theodosius I for this marriage. This may not have been due to his Gothic origins but instead due to his status as a pagan.

Fravitta was tasked with suppressing the revolts in the East (395). He likely possessed the rank of &quot;comes Isauriae&quot; at this time. According to Zosimus, Fravitta was responsible for having &quot;freed the entire East, from Cilicia to Phoenicia and Palestine, from the plague of brigands&quot;. Eunapius wrote, probably exaggerating, that the word &quot;banditry&quot; had been forgotten in the minds of the people. He was loyal to the Empire for all of his life, and rose through the ranks of the army, reaching the office of &quot;Magister militum.&quot;

In 400 he was promoted to &quot;Magister Militum per Orientem&quot; and tasked with leading the fleet of the Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and decisively defeated the fleet of the rebel Arian Goth Gainas, in Thrace, while they were trying to pass to Asia Minor. The Historian Zosimus noted that he was placed in charge of the Roman forces with a unanimous vote from the Senate and the Emperor. Gainas escaped across the Danube, where he was killed by Hunnic chieftain Uldin. As a reward, he asked to be allowed to worship the Pagan gods freely; the Emperor granted him his wish and designated him as consul for 401. Fravitta was also likely given a triumph for his victory. Eunapius records him returning to Constantinople &quot;joyfully and gloriously&quot; with circus games commemorating the defeat of Gainas.

Fravitta fell out of favor around 404 and was executed. Officially, he was accused of treachery under the belief that he had intentionally let Gainas escape. However, he was most likely killed as he had lost favor with the court. Fravitta accused a politician named Ioannes, who was beloved by Empress Eudoxia, of sowing division between Arcadius and Honorius. This led to a follower of Chrysostom named Hierax organizing his execution. Some sources argue that Fravitta was put to death in the year 401. Zosimus, a Roman historian who covered these events, omitted the death of Fravitta from his account, which ends at the year 401. Other accounts from the time do not mention his death as occurring within the year 401, but instead mention his death as occurring around the death of Eudoxia, in the year 404.

<text>Flying squirrels (scientifically known as Pteromyini or Petauristini) are a tribe of 50 species of squirrels in the family Sciuridae. Despite their name, they are not in fact capable of full flight in the same way as birds or bats, but they are able to glide from one tree to another with the aid of a patagium, a furred skin membrane that stretches from wrist to ankle. Their long tails also provide stability as they glide. Anatomically they are very similar to other squirrels with a number of adaptations to suit their lifestyle; their limb bones are longer and their hand bones, foot bones, and distal vertebrae are shorter. Flying squirrels are able to steer and exert control over their glide path with their limbs and tail.

Molecular studies have shown that flying squirrels are monophyletic (having a common ancestor with no non-flying descendants) and originated some 18–20 million years ago. The genus &quot;Paracitellus&quot; is the earliest lineage to the flying squirrel dating back to the late Oligocene era. Most are nocturnal and omnivorous, eating fruit, seeds, buds, flowers, insects, gastropods, spiders, fungi, bird&#x27;s eggs, tree sap and young birds. The young are born in a nest and are at first naked and helpless. They are cared for by their mother and by five weeks are able to practice gliding skills so that by ten weeks they are ready to leave the nest.

Some captive-bred southern flying squirrels have become domesticated as small household pets, a type of &quot;pocket pet&quot;.

==Description==

Flying squirrels are not capable of flight like birds or bats; instead, they glide between trees. They are capable of obtaining lift within the course of these flights, with flights recorded to . The direction and speed of the animal in midair are varied by changing the positions of its limbs, largely controlled by small cartilaginous wrist bones. There is a cartilage projection from the wrist that the squirrel holds upwards during a glide. This specialized cartilage is only present in flying squirrels and not other gliding mammals. Possible origins for the styliform cartilage have been explored, and the data suggests that it is most likely homologous to the carpal structures that can be found in other squirrels. This cartilage along with the manus forms a wing tip to be used during gliding. After being extended, the wing tip may adjust to various angles, controlling aerodynamic movements. The wrist also changes the tautness of the patagium, a furry parachute-like membrane that stretches from wrist to ankle. It has a fluffy tail that stabilizes in flight. The tail acts as an adjunct airfoil, working as an air brake before landing on a tree trunk.

===Similar gliding animals===
The colugos, Petauridae, and Anomaluridae are gliding mammals which are similar to flying squirrels through convergent evolution, although are not particularly close in relation. Like the flying squirrel, they are scansorial mammals that use their patagium to glide, unpowered, to move quickly through their environment.

===Evolutionary history===
Prior to the 21st century, the evolutionary history of the flying squirrel was frequently debated. This debate was clarified greatly as a result of two molecular studies. These studies found support that flying squirrels originated 18–20 million years ago, are monophyletic, and have a sister relationship with tree squirrels. Due to their close ancestry, the morphological differences between flying squirrels and tree squirrels reveal insight into the formation of the gliding mechanism. Compared to squirrels of similar size, flying squirrels, northern and southern flying squirrels show lengthening in bones of the lumbar vertebrae and forearm, whereas bones of the feet, hands, and distal vertebrae are reduced in length. Such differences in body proportions reveal the flying squirrels&#x27; adaptation to minimize wing loading and to increase maneuverability while gliding. The consequence for these differences is that unlike regular squirrels, flying squirrels are not well adapted for quadrupedal locomotion and therefore must rely more heavily on their gliding abilities.

Several hypotheses have attempted to explain the evolution of gliding in flying squirrels. One possible explanation is related to energy efficiency and foraging. Gliding is an energetically efficient way to progress from one tree to another while foraging, as opposed to climbing down trees and maneuvering on the ground floor or executing dangerous leaps in the air. By gliding at high speeds, flying squirrels can rummage through a greater area of forest more quickly than tree squirrels. Flying squirrels can glide long distances by increasing their aerial speed and increasing their lift.

Other hypotheses state that the mechanism evolved to avoid nearby predators and prevent injuries. If a dangerous situation arises on a specific tree, flying squirrels can glide to another, and thereby typically escape the previous danger. Furthermore, take-off and landing procedures during leaps, implemented for safety purposes, may explain the gliding mechanism. While leaps at high speeds are important to escape danger, the high-force impact of landing on a new tree could be detrimental to a squirrel&#x27;s health. Yet the gliding mechanism of flying squirrels involves structures and techniques during flight that allow for great stability and control. If a leap is miscalculated, a flying squirrel may easily steer back onto the original course by using its gliding ability. A flying squirrel also creates a large glide angle when approaching its target tree, decreasing its velocity due to an increase in air resistance and allowing all four limbs to absorb the impact of the target.

=== Fluorescence ===
In 2019 it was observed, by chance, that a flying squirrel fluoresced pink under UV light. Subsequent research by biologists at Northland College in Northern Wisconsin found that this is true for all three species of North American flying squirrels. At this time it is unknown what purpose this serves. Non-flying squirrels do not fluoresce under UV light.

==Taxonomy==

=== Recent species ===
New World flying squirrels belong to the genus &quot;Glaucomys&quot; (Greek for &quot;gleaming mouse&quot;). Old World flying squirrels belong to the genus &quot;Pteromys&quot; (Greek for &quot;winged mouse&quot;).

The three species of the genus &quot;Glaucomys&quot; (&quot;Glaucomys sabrinus&quot;, &quot;Glaucomys volans&quot; and &quot;Glaucomys oregonensis&quot;) are native to North America and Central America; many other taxa are found throughout Asia as well, with the range of the Siberian Flying Squirrel (&quot;Pteromys volans&quot;) reaching into parts of northeast Europe (Russia, Finland and Estonia).

===Fossil species===
Flying squirrels have a well-documented fossil record from the Oligocene onwards. Some fossil genera go far back as the Eocene, and given that the flying squirrels are thought to have diverged later, these are likely misidentifications.

==Life cycles==

The life expectancy of flying squirrels in the wild is about six years, and flying squirrels can live up to fifteen years in zoos. The mortality rate in young flying squirrels is high because of predators and diseases. Predators of flying squirrels include tree snakes, raccoons, owls, martens, fishers, coyotes, bobcats, and feral cats. In the Pacific Northwest of North America, the northern spotted owl (&quot;Strix occidentalis&quot;) is a common predator of flying squirrels.

Flying squirrels are usually nocturnal, since they are not adept at escaping birds of prey that hunt during the daytime. They eat according to their environment; they are omnivorous, and will eat whatever food they can find. The North American southern flying squirrel eats seeds, insects, gastropods (slugs and snails), spiders, shrubs, flowers, fungi, and tree sap.

===Reproduction===
The mating season for flying squirrels is during February and March. When the infants are born, the female squirrels live with them in maternal nest sites. The mothers nurture and protect them until they leave the nest. The males do not participate in nurturing their offspring.

At birth, flying squirrels are mostly hairless, apart from their whiskers, and most of their senses are not present. Their internal organs are visible through the skin, and their sex can be signified. By week five, they are almost fully developed. At that point, they can respond to their environment and start to develop a mind of their own. Through the upcoming weeks of their lives, they practice leaping and gliding. After two and a half months, their gliding skills are perfected, they are ready to leave the nest, and are capable of independent survival.

===Diet===
Flying squirrels can easily forage for food in the night, given their highly developed sense of smell. They harvest fruits, nuts, fungi, and birds&#x27; eggs. Many gliders have specialized diets and there is evidence to believe that gliders may be able to take advantage of scattered protein deficient food. Additionally, gliding is a fast form of locomotion and by reducing travel time between patches, they can increase the amount of foraging time.

<text>David Eugene Woodley (October 25, 1958 – May 4, 2003) was an American professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Miami Dolphins (1980–1983), and the Pittsburgh Steelers (1984–1985). He played college football for the LSU Tigers.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Shreveport, Louisiana, Woodley was the fifth of seven children of attorney John Woodley and Hazel (Iles) Woodley. He was a three-year starter and all-state quarterback for Byrd High School in Shreveport and graduated in 1976. Woodley played college football at LSU in Baton Rouge under longtime head coach Charlie McClendon, sharing playing time with the more popular Steve Ensminger of Baton Rouge.

In his final college game as a senior in December 1979, he led the Tigers to a 34–10 victory over Wake Forest University in the Tangerine Bowl and was named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player; LSU finished the season at 7–5.

==Professional career==

===Miami Dolphins===
As quarterback for the Miami Dolphins, Woodley is best known as the bridge between the eras of hall of famers Bob Griese and Dan Marino. Despite being an eighth-round selection in the 1980 NFL draft and initially fourth on the depth chart, he was elected the team MVP for his rookie season in 1980. That year, he set the Dolphins&#x27; team record for most pass completions (176) for a rookie quarterback, later broken by Ryan Tannehill in 2012. In , he became one of the few NFL players to score touchdowns passing, running and receiving in an NFL season. Woodley at one point split time with backup Don Strock so evenly that the quarterback tandem was often referred to as &quot;WoodStrock&quot;. Woodley started for the Dolphins in the 1981 playoff game versus the San Diego Chargers. After Miami fell behind 24–0, Strock led the Dolphins back into the game, though the Chargers ultimately won in overtime.

In the strike-shortened 1982 Miami Dolphins season, Woodley handled the lion&#x27;s share of the time at quarterback en route to Miami winning the American Football Conference title. The Dolphins went on to face the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVII. At 24 years and three months of age, he was the youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl at the time. Despite starting the game well with a 76-yard touchdown pass to Jimmy Cefalo, Woodley and the entire offense then struggled, with no completions in eight attempts in the second half. The Redskins won, 27–17.

Woodley began the 1983 Miami Dolphins season as Miami&#x27;s starting quarterback, but the Dolphins&#x27; offense continued to underperform. The ongoing struggles prompted coach Don Shula to insert Marino, then a rookie, into the lineup midway through a 17–7 road loss to the New Orleans Saints in week five. By the next week, Marino was named the starter for the remainder of the season.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
The Pittsburgh Steelers acquired Woodley in February 1984 by trading a third-round draft pick to Miami. He would compete with Mark Malone for his new team&#x27;s starting quarterback job, as elbow problems had forced Terry Bradshaw to retire and Cliff Stoudt had left for the USFL. Infamously, this came &quot;after&quot; the Steelers passed up local native Marino for Gabriel Rivera (who played in six NFL games before a drunk-driving crash left him paralyzed) in the 1983 NFL draft. Woodley split the starting quarterback duty with Malone during both the 1984 and 1985 NFL seasons.

Notified by head coach Chuck Noll that Malone, and not he, would be the starter for the upcoming 1986 season, Woodley abruptly retired in June despite being the Steelers&#x27; highest-paid player ($500,000).

In 1987, the Green Bay Packers acquired Woodley from the Steelers for a draft pick, but his stay was short, and his playing career officially ended when he was released in late August.

Woodley is one of two quarterbacks in NFL history, along with Ken Stabler, to have a career winning percentage above .600 while throwing at least 10 more interceptions than touchdowns. Woodley&#x27;s career record was 34–18–1 (), despite throwing 63 interceptions against his 48 career touchdown passes.

==Death==
After football, Woodley returned to Shreveport and increasingly drank, causing several health problems. Married in 1981 to Suzanne Pugh, the couple later divorced. At age 33, he underwent a liver transplant at Willis-Knighton Medical Center in Shreveport in March 1992. Eleven years later, Woodley died from complications due to kidney and liver failure on May 4, 2003. Twenty years after Super Bowl XVII, he became the youngest Super Bowl starting quarterback to die. Since Woodley&#x27;s death, only Super Bowl XXXIV starter Steve McNair, murdered in 2009 at age 36, died at a younger age. Woodley was buried at St. Joseph Cemetery in Shreveport, alongside his parents.

<text>Sir William Fox (20 January 1812 – 23 June 1893) was the second premier of New Zealand and held that office on four occasions in the 19th century, while New Zealand was still a colony. He was known for his confiscation of Māori land rights, his contributions to the education system (such as establishing the University of New Zealand), and his work to increase New Zealand&#x27;s autonomy from Britain. He has been described as determined and intelligent, but also as bitter and &quot;too fond&quot; of personal attacks. Different aspects of his personality are emphasised by different accounts.

==Early life==
Fox was born on 20 January 1812 at 5 Westoe Village in South Shields, then part of County Durham, in north-east England, and baptised on 2 September of that year; he was the son of the Rev. George Townshend Fox, deputy lieutenant of co. Durham. He was educated initially at Durham School. He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford in 1828, graduating B.A. 1832 and M.A. 1839. His activities for several years after graduating are a mystery.

In 1838 he studied law in London. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1842. Shortly after that he married Sarah Halcomb. The couple decided that they would emigrate to New Zealand.

Upon his arrival in Wellington Fox&#x27;s legal qualifications were recognised, but there was little work, and so he supplemented his income by writing for local periodicals. Fox lost the right to practice as a lawyer when, in 1843, he refused to swear an oath that he considered &quot;degrading&quot;. This event forced him to focus almost entirely on writing and journalism. That year, following the death of Arthur Wakefield, Fox was appointed local agent for the New Zealand Company at Nelson.

==Early political activity==
Initially, Fox was opposed to government negotiations with Māori over land, stating that Māori had a right only to land that they used. He also condemned the colonial government&#x27;s &quot;weak&quot; response to the killing of Arthur Wakefield, a New Zealand Company official who had attempted to expand the settlement at Nelson into Māori-held lands. Fox&#x27;s criticism of Governor Robert FitzRoy eventually played a part in FitzRoy&#x27;s removal from office. In 1843 Fox was chosen by the New Zealand Company as Wakefield&#x27;s replacement in Nelson.

In Nelson, Fox met with mixed success. There was little direct conflict with the Māori, and most of Fox&#x27;s work was related to economic development. Poor planning and inaccurate land surveying had left colonists with considerably less than had been promised them, and Fox was responsible for resolving the matter. While many modern historians believe that he did a good job, Fox himself found that even his best efforts were not good enough for the angry colonists. Fox increasingly spent his time leading parties into the wilderness near Nelson, an activity which he seems to have enjoyed. Fox was physically active all through his life.

In 1848, William Wakefield died. As the New Zealand Company&#x27;s senior officer in the colony, he was Fox&#x27;s superior. Fox quickly travelled to Wellington, and managed to secure himself Wakefield&#x27;s position. He accomplished this mainly because of the short distance between Nelson and Wellington, which enabled him to win the position before instructions could be received from other cities. He was not the first choice of the Company&#x27;s board in London, which preferred Dillon Bell, but his quick action managed to gain him enough support to receive the appointment.

The Company was in decline after the deaths of both Edward and Arthur Wakefield. Fox gradually became less active in the Company, taking more of an interest in the colonial government. He was a strong opponent of Governor George Grey, had suspended the New Zealand Constitution Act 1846 to grant self-government to the settlers. He frequently denounced the administration and the judiciary as corrupt and incompetent.

In 1851, Fox travelled to London on behalf of a group of Wellington settlers. There he met Edward Gibbon Wakefield, elder brother of William and Arthur. He discussed his ideas about a constitution for New Zealand, strongly supporting self-rule, provincial autonomy, and two elected houses of parliament. He also attempted to meet Earl Grey, the Secretary of State for the Colonies but was refused. When the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 was passed by Britain&#x27;s parliament the following year, it incorporated some of Fox&#x27;s ideas but was not satisfactory to him.

==Entry to Parliament==



Before returning to New Zealand, Fox and his wife spent some time travelling in Canada, the United States, and Cuba. When they returned to New Zealand, the new constitution was in effect, and elections had already been held. In 1855 Fox was elected MP for Wanganui. He fought on a strong platform of provincial autonomy, and was particularly opposed to the government formed the following year by Henry Sewell, who took the newly created office of Premier of New Zealand. Fox managed to oust Sewell from the new post in only 13 days, becoming New Zealand&#x27;s second Premier. Fox, however, lasted only 13 days himself before being ousted by Edward Stafford. Fox spent the first years of Stafford&#x27;s premiership in semi-retirement, but later returned to be Stafford&#x27;s primary opponent in parliament.

Fox appears to have changed his views somewhat regarding Māori land rights, as he strongly opposed the government&#x27;s policy on that issue. He blamed Stafford&#x27;s administration, along with Governor Thomas Gore Browne, for the wars in Taranaki, which broke out when a Māori chief refused to sell his land. Fox was widely believed to have converted to support of the Māori, although many modern historians claim that his opposition to land seizure was due to a pragmatic wish to avoid war, not a change of philosophy. Lack of evidence makes it difficult to tell which was the case.

==Premierships==

In 1861, Fox successfully proposed a vote of no confidence in Stafford, and took the premiership again. Among the measures introduced were law changes designed to accommodate Māori political structures, a halt on attempts to acquire Māori land, and a less confrontational attitude in existing conflicts. Again, dispute exists as to whether this was motivated by pragmatism or support of Māori rights. His attempts to reduce conflict with Māori were undermined by Governor Grey, who had returned for another term, and was a strong believer in the need to confront Māori militarily. Grey&#x27;s construction of military infrastructure and his deployment of troops reduced Māori trust of any initiatives by the government.

In 1862, Fox was a passenger on the SS &quot;White Swan&quot; together with several other senior members of the New Zealand government. The ship was holed by a rock while steaming from Napier to Wellington and began sinking. Captain Allen Harper deliberately ran the ship aground and thereby saved the lives of all those on board.

After becoming increasingly involved in a dispute with Grey over responsibility for policy towards Māori, Fox lost a vote of confidence in 1862. The following year he returned to government, but only as a minister – the premiership went to Frederick Whitaker. Fox appears to have had little to do with the policies of this government, which involved considerable confiscations of land from the Māori. After his term as a minister ended, Fox and his wife travelled in Australia for several years.

Upon returning to New Zealand, Fox was encouraged by the Opposition to return to politics, which was once again dominated by Fox&#x27;s rival Edward Stafford. Fox was elected to parliament, and relaunched his attack on Stafford&#x27;s policies on Māori relations and provincial affairs. Fox defeated Stafford in 1869, taking the premiership for the third time. Fox set about reducing military activities, and ceased any major attempts to engage the Māori with force. Increasingly Fox found himself overshadowed by his treasurer, Julius Vogel. Vogel&#x27;s extensive plans for the development of New Zealand, involving borrowing money to finance public works, soon became the most prominent feature of Fox&#x27;s government, but had little to do with Fox himself. Eventually, Fox began to abandon his leadership role within the government, and the resulting disunity allowed Stafford to defeat Fox in 1872.

After this, Fox decided that he would not seek further office. His role in politics, however, was not quite over – when George Waterhouse, Stafford&#x27;s successor, suddenly resigned, Fox was called upon to assume the premiership as a caretaker until a new leader was found. When Vogel returned to New Zealand from an overseas trip Fox stepped down, and Vogel&#x27;s premiership began.

He was the Member of Parliament for Wanganui and Rangitikei in the second parliament (1855–1860), Rangitikei in the third, fourth and fifth parliaments (1861–1865, when he resigned; 1868–1870; 1871–1875, when he resigned), Wanganui in the sixth parliament (1876–1879, when he was defeated), and Rangitikei again (1880–81, when he was defeated).

==William Fox Jr.==
In 1868 at Te Ngutu O Te Manu (Beak of the bird), a battle took place between the forces of the Hah Hau rebel Riwha Tītokowaru and the Colonial army commanded by Thomas McDonnell. The colonial forces were ambushed and retreated. During the retreat, two Māori scouts found two boys who were about six years old. One boy was killed, and the other, Ngatau Omahuru, was given by Māori scout, Pirimona, to Herewini of the Ngāti Te Ūpokoiri Iwi.

While in Whanganui the boy came to the attention of the magistrate Walter Buller, who purchased him a set of European clothes and boots. The boy&#x27;s picture was taken in these clothes. The Buller family looked after the boy.

He was baptised William Fox in the presence of William Fox senior, then an MP. The young William was taken to Wellington by coach, probably on 25 January 1869. He was housed at a hostelry where visiting Māori lodged, lived there for three years, and was educated at a private school called Mowbray&#x27;s near the hostelry. Three other Māori students, two of them the sons of Chief Wi Tako, attended the same school. The adopted son then moved in with the Fox family. According to Māori sources, William Junior and Mrs Sarah Fox, who was childless, became very close. He lived with the family until he was about 12.

In 1874 he was enrolled in the new Wellington College where he had a photo taken with the other students and staff on Inauguration Day 1874. In 1875 The Fox family took William Junior on a world tour to San Francisco by paddle steamer and then across the US and on to Great Britain to visit Fox relatives.

At 16, William junior joined a law firm as a clerk with Buller, Lewis and Gully, where he received about five years training. On a trip to the Taranaki area in 1878 he met members of his tribe and a young Māori woman, Hinemoa. He met the Māori leaders Te Whiti and Tohu Kākahi at Parihaka, and decided to live in Taranaki. It appears he was heavily influenced by Te Whiti and Tohu and at some stage had an office in Tohu&#x27;s meeting house at Parihaka. He set up a Māori school near Parihaka.

Later after the closure of Parihaka he worked as a translator and interpreter in Whanganui and then set up a business in Hawera teaching the Māori language. He never married. He corresponded with old soldiers about the Taranaki War and died in 1918.

==Later life==
In 1879, Fox was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). He was appointed a commissioner to inquire into Native Land Titles.

Fox was involved in the temperance movement against alcohol. He was a founder of the &quot;New Zealand Alliance&quot; (for the Abolition of the Liquor Traffic), of which he was the first president, from 1887 to 1893.

He continued to undertake considerable physical exercise and, guided by Harry Peters, climbed Mount Taranaki in 1892, aged 80. He died in Auckland on 23 June 1893 aged 81. He was buried at Purewa Cemetery in the Auckland suburb of Meadowbank.

The town of Foxton, founded in 1885, was named after Sir William.

=== Westoe house ===
Fox bought of the controversially acquired Rangitīkei block, near Greatford, about 1849. In 1868 an attempt to subdivide a township of Marsden failed because of a liquor ban. The current Westoe was designed by Charles Tringham and built for Fox in 1874 in Italianate style. It was sold in 1885 and was listed as a Category 1 Historic Place on 29 November 1985. The gardens include a cedar of Lebanon planted by Fox.

<text>Mark Hume McCormack (November 6, 1930 – May 16, 2003) was an American lawyer, sports agent and writer. He was the founder and chairman of International Management Group, now IMG, an international management organization serving sports figures and celebrities.

==Business career==
After his Army discharge, McCormack worked as an attorney at the Cleveland law firm, Arter &amp; Hadden. In the 1950s he helped organize one-day golf exhibitions for professionals around the United States. In 1960, McCormack founded IMG.

McCormack wrote several books, including &quot;The Terrible Truth About Lawyers&quot; and &quot;What They Don&#x27;t Teach You at Harvard Business School&quot;, which spent 21 consecutive weeks at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list. His annual publication &quot;The World of Professional Golf&quot;, first published in 1967, included an (unofficial) world ranking system. In his book &quot;What They Don&#x27;t Teach You at Harvard Business School,&quot; McCormack tells a fictionalized story of a Harvard study in which the three percent of graduates who had clear, written goals earned ten times as much as the 97 percent who didn&#x27;t have clear, written goals. McCormack and numerous motivational speakers, including Tony Robbins and Brian Tracy, have used various versions of this story in their presentations.

==Originated rankings for golf and tennis==
The system used to calculate Mark McCormack&#x27;s world golf rankings was adapted in 1986 to become the Official World Golf Ranking system, with McCormack chairing the rankings committee made up of representatives from all the major golf tours. McCormack pioneered a similar system for tennis rankings. McCormack met his second wife Betsy Nagelsen-McCormack, a two-time Australian Open doubles champion and a Wimbledon doubles finalist, while she was a business client. They married in 1986. The couple founded the McCormack–Nagelsen Tennis Center at the College of William &amp; Mary, which houses the ITA Women&#x27;s Collegiate Tennis Hall of Fame.

==Death==
McCormack died at a New York hospital on May 16, 2003, age 72, from complications after suffering a cardiac event four months earlier that left him in a coma. His second wife, Betsy Nagelsen, their daughter, Maggie, and children from his first marriage to Nancy Breckenridge McCormack, Todd and Leslie, later shared $750 million, when the family&#x27;s shares in IMG were sold.

==Honors==
In July 2006, McCormack was selected for induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame in the lifetime achievement category and was inducted in October 2006. On January 23, 2008, he was also inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. He was featured as one of the Forbes 400 Richest Americans in 1995, 1998, 2001. In 1990, he was named the &quot;Most Powerful Man in Sports&quot; by &quot;Sporting News&quot;. The University of Massachusetts at Amherst has also named their Sport Management department after McCormack.

The British film &quot;Wimbledon&quot; (2004) was dedicated to Mark McCormack by director Richard Loncraine.

The Mark H. McCormack Medal is awarded to the leading player in the World Amateur Golf Ranking after the U.S. Amateur and the European Amateur.

The Mark H. McCormack Award is awarded to the player who has spent the most weeks at first place in the Official World Golf Ranking during a calendar year. The first 13 of these awards after its inception went to Tiger Woods.

<text>Zofia Kossak-Szczucka ( (also Kossak-Szatkowska); 10 August 1889 – 9 April 1968) was a Polish writer and World War II resistance fighter. She co-founded two wartime Polish organizations: Front for the Rebirth of Poland and Żegota, set up to assist Polish Jews to escape the Holocaust. In 1943, she was arrested by the Germans and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, but survived the war.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Zofia Kossak was the daughter of Tadeusz Kossak, who was the twin brother of painter Wojciech Kossak, and granddaughter of painter Juliusz Kossak. She married twice. In 1923, following the death of her first husband Stefan Szczucki in Lwiw, she settled in the village of Górki Wielkie in Cieszyn Silesia where in 1925 she married Zygmunt Szatkowski.

===Activism===
She was associated with the Czartak literary group, and wrote mainly for the Catholic press. Her best-known work from that period is &quot;The Blaze&quot;, a memoir of the Russian Revolution of 1917. In 1936, she received the prestigious Gold Laurel (&quot;Złoty Wawrzyn&quot;) of the Polish Academy of Literature. Kossak-Szczucka&#x27;s historical novels include &quot;Beatum scelus&quot; (1924), &quot;Złota wolność&quot; (Golden Liberty, 1928), &quot;Legnickie pole&quot; (&quot;The Field of Legnica&quot;, 1930), &quot;Trembowla&quot; (1939), &quot;Suknia Dejaniry&quot; (&quot;The Gift of Nessus&quot;, 1939). Best known are &quot;Krzyżowcy&quot; (&quot;Angels in The Dust&quot;, 1935), &quot;Król trędowaty&quot; (&quot;The Leper King&quot;, 1936), and &quot;Bez oręża&quot; (&quot;Blessed are The Meek&quot;, 1937) dealing with the Crusades and later &quot;Francis of Assisi&quot;, translated into several languages. She also wrote &quot;Z miłości&quot; (&quot;From Love&quot;, 1926) and &quot;Szaleńcy boży&quot; (&quot;God&#x27;s Madmen&quot;, 1929), on religious themes.

===World War II===

====Press activities====
During the German occupation of Poland, she worked in the underground press: from 1939 to 1941, she co-edited the underground newspaper &quot;Polska żyje&quot; (&quot;Poland Lives&quot;). In 1941, she co-founded the Catholic organization &quot;Front Odrodzenia Polski&quot; (&quot;Front for the Rebirth of Poland&quot;), and edited its newspaper, &quot;Prawda&quot; (&quot;The Truth&quot;).

In the underground, she used the code name &quot;Weronika&quot;.

====&quot;Protest!&quot;====

In the summer of 1942, when the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto began, Kossak-Szczucka published a leaflet entitled &quot;Protest,&quot; of which 5,000 copies were printed. In the leaflet, she described in graphic terms the conditions in the ghetto, and the horrific circumstances of the deportations then taking place. &quot;All will perish ... Poor and rich, old, women, men, youngsters, infants, Catholics dying with the name of Jesus and Mary together with Jews. Their only guilt is that they were born into the Jewish nation condemned to extermination by Hitler.&quot;

The world, Kossak-Szczucka wrote, was silent in the face of this atrocity. &quot;England is silent, so is America, even the influential international Jewry, so sensitive in its reaction to any transgression against its people, is silent. Poland is silent... Dying Jews are surrounded only by a host of Pilates washing their hands in innocence.&quot; Those who are silent in the face of murder, she wrote, become accomplices to the crime. Kossak-Szczucka saw this largely as an issue of religious ethics. &quot;Our feelings toward Jews have not changed,&quot; she wrote. &quot;We do not stop thinking of them as political, economic and ideological enemies of Poland.&quot; But, she wrote, this does not relieve Polish Catholics of their duty to oppose the crimes being committed in their country.

She co-founded the Provisional Committee to Aid Jews (&quot;Tymczasowy Komitet Pomocy Żydom&quot;), which later turned into the council to Aid Jews (&quot;Rada Pomocy Żydom&quot;), codenamed Żegota, an underground organization whose sole purpose was to save Jews in Poland from Nazi extermination. In 1985, she was posthumously named one of the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem.

Regarding Kossak-Szczucka&#x27;s &quot;Protest&quot;, Robert D. Cherry and Annamaria Orla-Bukowska wrote in the introduction to &quot;Rethinking Poles and Jews&quot;: &quot;Without at all whitewashing her antisemitism in the document, she vehemently called for active intercession on behalf of the Jews - precisely in the name of Polish Roman Catholicism and Polish patriotism. The deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto precipitated her cofounding of Żegota that same year - part of the Polish Underground State whose sole purpose was to save Jews.&quot;

====Arrest====
On 27 September 1943, Kossak-Szczucka was arrested in Warsaw by a German street patrol. The Germans, not realising who she was, sent her first to the prison at Pawiak and then to Auschwitz II-Birkenau concentration camp. When her true identity became known in April 1944, she was sent back to Warsaw for interrogation and sentenced to death. She was released in July 1944 through the efforts of the Polish underground and participated in the Warsaw Uprising.

===Post-war===
At the end of World War II, a communist regime began to establish itself in Poland. In June 1945, Kossak was called in by Jakub Berman, the new Polish minister of the interior, who was Jewish. He strongly advised her to leave the country immediately for her own protection, knowing what his government would do to political enemies, and also knowing from his brother, Adolf Berman, what Kossak had done to save Jewish lives. Kossak escaped to the West, but returned to Poland in 1957.

Kossak-Szczucka published &quot;Z Otchłani&quot; (&quot;From the Abyss&quot;, 1946), based on her experiences of Auschwitz. &quot;Dziedzictwo&quot; (&quot;Heritage&quot;. 1956–67) is about the Kossak family. &quot;Przymierze&quot; (&quot;The Covenant&quot;, 1951) tells the story of Abraham. Kossak-Szczucka also wrote books for children and teenagers, including &quot;Bursztyn&quot; (1936) and &quot;Gród nad jeziorem&quot; (&quot;Settlement by the Lake&quot;, 1938).

In 1964 she was one of the signatories of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture.

In 1982 the Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem recognised Zofia Kossak as a Righteous Among Nations. In 2009, the National Bank of Poland issued a coin posthumously commemorating the work of Kossak, Irena Sendler and Matylda Getter in helping Jews (see Żegota). In 2018 Zofia Kossak was awarded the highest Polish order, the Order of the White Eagle.

Zofia&#x27;s daughter, Anna Szatkowska (15 March 1928, Górki Wielkie – 27 February 2015), wrote a book about her experience during the Warsaw Uprising.

<doc id="354893" wikidata="Q313113" url="?curid=354893" title="Joseph Kosuth">
<text>Joseph Kosuth (; born January 31, 1945) is a Hungarian-American conceptual artist, who lives in New York and Venice, after having resided in various cities in Europe, including London, Ghent and Rome.

==Early life and career==
Born in Toledo, Ohio, Kosuth had an American mother and a Hungarian father.
(A relative, Lajos Kossuth, achieved notability for his role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.)
Joseph Kosuth attended the Toledo Museum School of Design from 1955 to 1962 and studied privately under the Belgian painter Line Bloom Draper. In 1963 Kosuth enrolled at the Cleveland Institute of Art on a scholarship. He spent the following year in Paris and traveled throughout Europe and North Africa. He moved to New York in 1965 and attended the School of Visual Arts there until 1967. From 1971 he studied anthropology and philosophy with Stanley Diamond and Bob Scholte at the New School for Social Research, New York.

At the School of Visual Arts he made a significant impact while technically a student, influencing fellow students as well as more traditional teachers there at the time such as Mel Bochner. As Kosuth&#x27;s reputation grew, he was removed from the student body and given a position as a teacher, by Silas Rhodes the founder and President of the school, in 1967. This caused a near revolt of the faculty, as he had been a disruptive presence in the opinion of many of the instructors, several who had unhappily faced his questioning of basic presumptions. His elevation to a teacher was also a result of Kosuth&#x27;s outside activities, which included the co-founding of the Museum of Normal Art (giving the first exposure to artists such as Robert Ryman, On Kawara, Hanne Darboven, among others) along with proselytizing and organizing artists in a direction which was later identified as the conceptual art movement. Through his art, writing and organizing, he emphasized his interest in the dialectical process of idea formation in relation to language and context. He introduced the notion that art, as he put it, &quot;was not a question of forms and colors but one of the production of meaning.&quot; His writing began a re-reading of modernism, initiating a major re-evaluation of the importance of Marcel Duchamp and signaling the shift into what we now identify, in art, as post-modernism. His analysis had a major impact on his practice as an artist and, soon after, on that of others. During this period he also maintained his academic interests. His position on the Faculty, Department of Fine Art, The School of Visual Arts, New York City continued until 1985. He since been Professor at the Hochschule für Bildende Künste, Hamburg, 1988–90; and at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart, 1991–1997. Currently he is Professor at the Kunstakademie Munich and at the Istituto Universitario di Architettura, Faculty of Design and Art, in Venice. He has been invited as a visiting professor and guest lecturer at various universities and institutions for nearly thirty years, some of which include: Yale University; Cornell University; New York University; Duke University; UCLA; Cal Arts; Cooper Union; Pratt Institute; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Art Institute of Chicago; Royal Academy, Copenhagen; Ashmoleon Museum, Oxford University; University of Rome; Berlin Kunstakademie; Royal College of Art, London; Glasgow School of Art; The Hayward Gallery, London; The Sorbonne, Paris; The Sigmund Freud Museum, Vienna.

Kosuth continued his work, writing, exhibiting and exhibition organizing and rapidly became acknowledged as one of the pioneers of Conceptual art and installation art; initiating language-based works as well as photo-based works and appropriation strategies since the beginning of his work in the mid-1960s. His activity has consistently explored the production and role of language and meaning within art. Kosuth&#x27;s nearly thirty-five year inquiry into the relation of language to art has taken the form of installations, museum exhibitions, public commissions and publications throughout Europe, the Americas and the Far East, including five Documenta(s) and four Venice Biennale(s). His earliest work, the Protoinvestigations, were done when he was only twenty years old and as they are considered among the first works of the Conceptual art movement they are included in collections such as The Museum of Modern Art, The Guggenheim, The Whitney, Centre Pompidou, The Tate Gallery, The Reina Sophia, Madrid, among many others, and constitute a youthful record in most of these major collections. Joseph Kosuth&#x27;s career includes over 170 one-person exhibitions in museums and galleries around the world, twenty-two of them by the time he was twenty-five years old.

In 1989 Kosuth, along with Peter Pakesch, founded The Foundation for the Arts as part of The Sigmund Freud Museum, Vienna. He is the President of the foundation. The foundation was established on the 50th anniversary of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s death, and is a society of artists engaged, through contributions by members, in forming a collection of contemporary art in honor of and in relevance to Sigmund Freud. The foundation&#x27;s exhibition space is in the former offices of Anna Freud at the Sigmund Freud Museum, Vienna.

==Work==
Kosuth belongs to a broadly international generation of conceptual artists that began to emerge in the mid-1960s, stripping art of personal emotion, reducing it to nearly pure information or idea and greatly playing down the art object. Along with Lawrence Weiner, On Kawara, Hanne Darboven and others, Kosuth gives special prominence to language. His art generally strives to explore the nature of art rather than producing what is traditionally called &quot;art&quot;. Kosuth&#x27;s works are frequently self-referential. He remarked in 1969:
:&quot;The &#x27;value&#x27; of particular artists after Duchamp can be weighed according to how much they questioned the nature of art.&quot;

Kosuth&#x27;s works frequently reference Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psycho-analysis and Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s philosophy of language.

His first conceptual work &quot;Leaning Glass&quot;, consisted of an object, a photograph of it and dictionary definitions of the words denoting it. In 1966 Kosuth also embarked upon a series of works entitled &quot;Art as Idea as Idea&quot;, involving texts, through which he probed the condition of art. The works in this series took the form of photostat reproductions of dictionary definitions of words such as &quot;water&quot;, &quot;meaning&quot;, and &quot;idea&quot;. Accompanying these photographic images are certificates of documentation and ownership (not for display) indicating that the works can be made and remade for exhibition purposes.

One of his most famous works is &quot;One and Three Chairs&quot;. The piece features a physical chair, a photograph of that chair, and the text of a dictionary definition of the word &quot;chair&quot;. The photograph is a representation of the actual chair situated on the floor, in the foreground of the work. The definition, posted on the same wall as the photograph, delineates in words the concept of what a chair is, in its various incarnations. In this and other, similar works, &quot;Four Colors Four Words&quot; and &quot;Glass One and Three&quot;, Kosuth forwards tautological statements, where the works literally are what they say they are. A collaboration with independent filmmaker Marion Cajori, &quot;Sept. 11, 1972&quot; was a Minimalist portrait of sunlight in Cajori&#x27;s studio.

His seminal text &quot;Art after Philosophy&quot;, written in 1968–69, had a major impact on the thinking about art at the time and has been seen since as a kind of &quot;manifesto&quot; of Conceptual art insofar as it provided the only theoretical framework for the practice at the time. (As a result, it has since been translated into 14 languages, and included in a score of anthologies.) It was, for the twenty-four year old Kosuth that wrote it, in fact more of a &quot;agitprop&quot; attack on Greenbergian formalism, what Kosuth saw as the last bastion of late, institutionalized modernism more than anything else. It also for him concluded at the time what he had learned from Wittgenstein - dosed with Walter Benjamin among others - as applied to that very transitional moment in art.

In the early 1970s, concerned with his &quot;ethnocentricity as a white, male artist&quot;, Kosuth enrolled in the New School to study anthropology. He visited the Trobriand Islands in the South Pacific (made famous in studies by the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski), and the Huallaga Indians in the Peruvian Amazon.

For Kosuth, his studies in cultural anthropology were a logical outgrowth that followed from his interest in the &quot;anthropological&quot; dimension of the later Wittgenstein. Indeed, it was the later Wittgenstein of the &quot;Investigation&quot; - which by accident he had read first - that led to works such as &quot;One and Three Chairs&quot; (among other influences), not the &quot;Tractatus&quot; as is often assumed. His anthropological &quot;field work&quot; was organized by him only for the purpose of informing his practice as an artist. (As he said to friends at the time: &quot;some artists learn how to weld, others go back to school.&quot;) By the early 1970s, he had an internationally recognized career and was in his late 20s. He found that he was, as he put it, &quot;a Eurocentric, white, male artist&quot;, and was increasingly culturally and politically uncomfortable with all that seemed naturally acceptable to his location. His study of cultural anthropology (and it was the New School perspective of Vico, Rousseau, Marx that provided him a direction out of the Ango-American philosophical context) led him to decide to spend time within other cultures, deeply embedded in other world views. He spent time in the Peruvian Amazon with the Yagua Indians living deep into the Peruvian side of the Amazon basin. He also lived in an area of Australia some hundreds of kilometers north of Alice Springs with an Aboriginal tribe that, before they were re-located four years previously from an area farther north, had not known of the existence of white people. Later, he spent time in the Trobriand islands with the Aboriginal tribe that Malinowski had studied and wrote on. From Kosuth&#x27;s point of view, &quot;I knew I could, would, never enter into their cultural reality, but I wanted to experience the edge of my own.&quot; It was this experience and study which lead to his well-known text &quot;The Artist as Anthropologist&quot; in 1975.

Hung on walls, his signature dark gray, Kosuth&#x27;s later, large photomontages trace a kind of artistic and intellectual autobiography. Each consists of a photograph of one of the artist&#x27;s own older works or installations, overlaid in top and bottom corners by two passages of philosophical prose quoted from intellectuals identified only by initials (they include Jacques Derrida, Martin Buber and Julia Kristeva).

===Collaborations===
In 1992, Kosuth designed the album cover for &quot;Fragments of a Rainy Season&quot; by John Cale.

Two years later, Kosuth collaborated with Ilya Kabakov to produce &quot;The Corridor of Two Banalities&quot;, shown at the Centre for Contemporary Art in Warsaw. This installation included 120 tables in a row to present text somewhat symptomatic of the cultures of which they both came from.

===Commissions===
Since 1990 Kosuth has also begun working on various permanent public commissions. In the early 1990s, he designed a Government-sponsored monument to the Egyptologist Jean Francois Champollion who deciphered the Rosetta Stone in Figeac; in Japan, he took on the curatorship of a show celebrating the Tokyo opening of Barneys New York; and in Frankfurt, Germany, and in Columbus, Ohio, he conceived neon monuments to the German cultural historian Walter Benjamin. In 1994, for the city of Tachikawa, Kosuth designed &quot;Words of a Spell, for Noëma&quot;, a 136-foot-long mural composed of quotes from Michiko Ishimure and James Joyce.

After projects at public buildings such as the Deutsche Bundesbank (1997), the Parliament House, Stockholm (1998), and the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region (1999), Kosuth was commissioned to propose a work for the newly renovated Bundestag in 2001, he designed a floor installation with texts by Ricarda Huch and Thomas Mann for the . In 2003, he created three installations in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, employing text, archival material, and objects from the museum&#x27;s collection to comment on the politics and philosophy behind museum collections. In 2009, Kosuth&#x27;s exhibition entitled &quot;ni apparence ni illusion&quot; (&quot;Neither Appearance Nor Illusion&quot;), an installation work throughout the 12th century walls of the Louvre Palace, opened at the Musée du Louvre in Paris and became a permanent work in October 2012. In 2011, celebrating the work of Charles Darwin, Kosuth created a commission in the library where Darwin was inspired to pursue his evolutionary theory. His work on the façade of the Council of State of the Netherlands will be inaugurated in October 2011 and he is currently working on a permanent work for the four towers of the façade of the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, expected to be completed in 2012.

===Lecturer===
Kosuth has taught widely, as a guest lecturer and as a member of faculties at the School of Visual Arts, New York City (1967–85); Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg (1988–90); State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart (1991–97); and the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich (2001–06). Currently Professor at Istituto Universitario di Architettura, Venice, Kosuth has functioned as visiting professor and guest lecturer at various universities and institutions for nearly forty years, some of which include: Yale University; Cornell University: New York University; Duke University; UCLA; Cal Arts; Cooper Union; Pratt Institute; The Museum of Modern Art, New York, Art Institute of Chicago, Royal Academy, Copenhagen; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford University; University of Rome, Berlin Kunstakademie; Royal College of Art, London; Glasgow School of Art; Hayward Gallery, London; Sorbonne, Paris; and the Sigmund Freud Museum, Vienna. His students have included, among others, Michel Majerus.

===Writings===
Kosuth became the American editor of the Art &amp; Language journal in 1969. He later was coeditor of &quot;The Fox&quot; magazine in 1975–76 and art editor of Marxist Perspectives in 1977–78. In addition, he has written several books on the nature of art and artists, including &quot;Artist as Anthropologist&quot;. In his essay &quot;Art after Philosophy&quot; (1969), he argued that art is the continuation of philosophy, which he saw at an end. He was unable to define art in so far as such a definition would destroy his private self-referential definition of art. Like the Situationists, he rejected formalism as an exercise in aesthetics, with its function to be aesthetic. Formalism, he said, limits the possibilities for art with minimal creative effort put forth by the formalist. Further, since concept is overlooked by the formalist, &quot;Formalist criticism is no more than an analysis of the physical attributes of particular objects which happen to exist in a morphological context&quot;. He further argues that the &quot;change from &#x27;appearance&#x27; to &#x27;conception&#x27; (which begins with Duchamp&#x27;s first unassisted readymade) was the beginning of &#x27;modern art&#x27; and the beginning of &#x27;conceptual art&#x27;.&quot; Kosuth explains that works of conceptual art are analytic propositions. They are linguistic in character because they express definitions of art. This makes them tautological. Art After Philosophy and After Collected Writings, 1966-1990 reveals between the lines a definition of &quot;art&quot; of which Joseph Kosuth meant to assure us. &quot;Art is an analytical proposition of context, thought, and what we do that is intentionally designated by the artist by making the implicit nature of culture, of what happens to us, explicit - internalizing its &#x27;explicitness&#x27; (making it again, &#x27;implicit&#x27;) and so on, for the purpose of understanding that is continually interacting and socio-historically located. These words, like actual works of art, are little more than historical curiosities, but the concept becomes a machine that makes the art beneficial, modest, rustic, contiguous, and humble.&quot;

==Exhibitions==
In 1969 Kosuth held his first solo exhibition at Leo Castelli Gallery, New York. That same year, he organized an exhibition of his work, Fifteen Locations, which took place simultaneously at fifteen museums and galleries worldwide; he also participated in the seminal exhibition of Conceptual art at the Seth Siegelaub Gallery, New York. In 1973, the Kunstmuseum Luzern presented a major retrospective of his art that traveled in Europe. In 1981, the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart and the Kunsthalle Bielefeld organized another major Kosuth retrospective. He was invited to exhibit at documentas V, VI, VII and IX (1972, 1978, 1982, 1992) and the Biennale di Venezia in 1976, 1993 and 1999. He continued to exhibit in Venice during the Biennale from 2011 onwards, with the European Cultural Centre. His most recent exhibition with this organisation was in 2017, where he exhibited in Palazzo Bembo.

===Curator===
For &quot;Fifteen People Present Their Favorite Book&quot;, a show mounted at Lannis Gallery, New York, in 1967, Kosuth assembled fellow artists Robert Morris, Ad Reinhardt, Sol LeWitt, Robert Mangold, Dan Graham, Robert Smithson, Carl Andre, Robert Ryman, among others. That same year, with fellow artist Christine Kozlov, he founded the Museum of Normal Art, New York, while they were both students at the School of Visual Arts. After giving a work in 1989 to the Sigmund Freud Museum, Vienna, Kosuth, heavily influenced by Freud, he invited other artists to do likewise; today the museum owns 13 works by 13 Freud-influenced Conceptualists. Also in 1989 Kosuth curated the show &quot;Ludwig Wittgenstein Das Spiel des Unsagbaren&quot; to commemorate the 100th birthday of the philosopher, in which he showed numerous works by fellow artists. The exhibition was shown at the Wiener Secession, Vienna, and the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels.

In response to the debate surrounding conservative attacks on the National Endowment for the Arts in 1990, Kosuth organized an exhibition entitled &quot;A Play of the Unmentionable&quot; focusing on issues of censorship and using works from the permanent collection of the Brooklyn Museum of Art. He culled objects from nearly every department of the museum, including religious paintings, many depictions of nudes, social satire and some erotica; among the selected works, therew were sculptures by Auguste Rodin of lesbians embracing, and furniture from the Bauhaus, the avant-garde German design school closed down by the Nazis. These were then juxtaposed with pithy and frequently moving observations from a number of writers in a way that emphasizes how perceptions of art are constantly changing. The works&#x27; sometimes extensive labels were written by their curators, while the larger type statements emanated from various art historians, philosophers and social critics.

==Recognition==
Kosuth was awarded a Cassandra Foundation Grant in 1968, at the age of 23, as the choice of Marcel Duchamp one week before he died. In 1993, he received the Menzione d&#x27;Onore at the Venice Biennale and was named a Chevalier de l&#x27;ordre des Arts et des Lettres. In 1999, in honour of his work, the French government issued a 3-franc postage stamp in Figeac. In 2001, he received the Laurea Honoris Causa doctorate in Philosophy and Letters from the University of Bologna. In 2003, Kosuth was awarded the Austrian Republic&#x27;s highest honour for accomplishments in science and culture, the Decoration of Honour in Gold. In 2017 European Cultural Centre Art Award was awarded to Kosuth for his lifelong dedication to create meaning through contemporary art. Other awards include the Brandeis Award (1990) and the Frederick Weisman Award (1991). The Addison Gallery of American Art (Andover, Massachusetts), the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art (Norman, Oklahoma), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Centre for International Light Art (Unna, Germany), the Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Lyon (Lyon, France), the National Gallery of Victoria (Melbourne, Australia), the Saint Louis Art Museum (St. Louis, Missouri), the University of Arizona Museum of Art (Tucson, Arizona), and the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York City) are among the museums holding work by Joseph Kosuth.

<text>Howard Hayes Scullard (9 February 1903 – 31 March 1983) was a British historian specialising in ancient history, notable for editing the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot; and for his many published works.

== Life and career ==
Scullard&#x27;s father was Herbert Hayes Scullard, a minister, and his mother Barbara Louisa Dodds.

Born in Bedford, England, his early education was at Highgate School, followed by St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was a tutor and then reader at New College London, from 1935 to 1959, when he became Professor of Ancient History at King&#x27;s College London, retiring in 1970. He nonetheless remained active in retirement and notably wrote chapters for the re-edition of &quot;The Cambridge Ancient History&quot;, but his contributions to volumes VII and VIII were published posthumously.

Perhaps his most widely known work is &quot;From the Gracchi to Nero: A History of Rome from 133 B.C. to A.D. 68&quot;, a text widely used by students studying Rome in the late republic, as well as Rome under the Julio-Claudians.

<text>In ballroom dancing and other dances, frame is the way the dancers&#x27; upper bodies are held when in dancing position. In swing and blues dances, frame is the body shape and muscle tone maintained by dancers, which allows the leader to communicate moves to the follower.

==Ballroom and other dances==
The frame is the way the dancers hold their hands, arms, shoulders, neck, head and upper torso. A good frame helps with balance and movement and also produces a good appearance of the dance couple.

The correct way to hold a frame depends on the particular dance; it is different in International Standard, International Latin, social Latin dances such as salsa, and others.

==Swing and blues dances==
The frame provides connection between the dance partners, making leading and following possible. A frame is a stable structural combination of both bodies maintained through the dancers&#x27; arms and/or legs, and allows the leader to transmit body movement to the follower, and for the follower to suggest ideas to the leader.

<text>In statistics, a &quot;k&quot;-th percentile, also known as percentile score or centile, is a score (e.g., a data point) a given percentage &quot;k&quot; of arranged scores in its frequency distribution falls (&quot;exclusive&quot; definition) or a score a given percentage falls (&quot;inclusive&quot; definition); i.e. a score in the &quot;k&quot;-th percentile would be above approximately &quot;k&quot;% of all scores in its set. For example, the 97th percentile of data is a data point below which 97 % of all data points exist (by the exclusive definition). Percentiles depends on how scores are arranged.

Percentiles are expressed in the same unit of measurement as the input scores, in percent; for example, if the scores refer to human weight, the corresponding percentiles will be expressed in kilograms or pounds.
In the limit of an infinite sample size, the percentile approximates the &quot;percentile function&quot;, the inverse of the cumulative distribution function.

Percentiles are a type of quantiles, obtained adopting a subdivision into 100 groups.
The 25th percentile is also known as the first &quot;quartile&quot; (&quot;Q&quot;1), the 50th percentile as the &quot;median&quot; or second quartile (&quot;Q&quot;2), and the 75th percentile as the third quartile (&quot;Q&quot;3).
For example, the 50th percentile (median) is the score (or , depending on the definition) which 50% of the scores in the distribution are found.

A related quantity is the &quot;percentile rank&quot; of a score, expressed in percent, which represents the fraction of scores in its distribution that are less than it, an exclusive definition.
Percentile scores and percentile ranks are often used in the reporting of test scores from norm-referenced tests, but, as just noted, they are not the same. For percentile ranks, a score is given and a percentage is computed. Percentile ranks are exclusive: if the percentile rank for a specified score is 90%, then 90% of the scores were lower. In contrast, for percentiles a percentage is given and a corresponding score is determined, which can be either exclusive or inclusive. The score for a specified percentage (e.g., 90th) indicates a score below which (exclusive definition) or at or below which (inclusive definition) other scores in the distribution fall.

==Definitions==
There is no standard definition of percentile;
however, all definitions yield similar results when the number of observations is very large and the probability distribution is continuous. In the limit, as the sample size approaches infinity, the 100&quot;p&quot;th percentile (0&lt;&quot;p&quot;&lt;1) approximates the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) thus formed, evaluated at &quot;p&quot;, as &quot;p&quot; approximates the CDF. This can be seen as a consequence of the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem. Some methods for calculating the percentiles are given below.

==The normal distribution and percentiles==
The methods given in the &quot;calculation methods&quot; section (below) are approximations for use in small-sample statistics. In general terms, for very large populations following a normal distribution, percentiles may often be represented by reference to a normal curve plot. The normal distribution is plotted along an axis scaled to standard deviations, or sigma (formula_1) units. Mathematically, the normal distribution extends to negative infinity on the left and positive infinity on the right. Note, however, that only a very small proportion of individuals in a population will fall outside the −3&quot;σ&quot; to +3&quot;σ&quot; range. For example, with human heights very few people are above the +3&quot;σ&quot; height level.

Percentiles represent the area under the normal curve, increasing from left to right. Each standard deviation represents a fixed percentile. Thus, rounding to two decimal places, −3&quot;σ&quot; is the 0.13th percentile, −2&quot;σ&quot; the 2.28th percentile, −1&quot;σ&quot; the 15.87th percentile, 0&quot;σ&quot; the 50th percentile (both the mean and median of the distribution), +1&quot;σ&quot; the 84.13th percentile, +2&quot;σ&quot; the 97.72nd percentile, and +3&quot;σ&quot; the 99.87th percentile. This is related to the 68–95–99.7 rule or the three-sigma rule. Note that in theory the 0th percentile falls at negative infinity and the 100th percentile at positive infinity, although in many practical applications, such as test results, natural lower and/or upper limits are enforced.

==Applications==
When ISPs bill &quot;burstable&quot; internet bandwidth, the 95th or 98th percentile usually cuts off the top 5% or 2% of bandwidth peaks in each month, and then bills at the nearest rate. In this way, infrequent peaks are ignored, and the customer is charged in a fairer way. The reason this statistic is so useful in measuring data throughput is that it gives a very accurate picture of the cost of the bandwidth. The 95th percentile says that 95% of the time, the usage is below this amount: so, the remaining 5% of the time, the usage is above that amount.

Physicians will often use infant and children&#x27;s weight and height to assess their growth in comparison to national averages and percentiles which are found in growth charts.

The 85th percentile speed of traffic on a road is often used as a guideline in setting speed limits and assessing whether such a limit is too high or low.

In finance, value at risk is a standard measure to assess (in a model-dependent way) the quantity under which the value of the portfolio is not expected to sink within a given period of time and given a confidence value.

==Calculation methods==

There are many formulas or algorithms for a percentile score. Hyndman and Fan identified nine and most statistical and spreadsheet software use one of the methods they describe. Algorithms either return the value of a score that exists in the set of scores (nearest-rank methods) or interpolate between existing scores and are either exclusive or inclusive.

The figure shows a 10-score distribution, illustrates the percentile scores that result from these different algorithms, and serves as an introduction to the examples given subsequently. The simplest are nearest-rank methods that return a score from the distribution, although compared to interpolation methods, results can be a bit crude. The Nearest-Rank Methods table shows the computational steps for exclusive and inclusive methods.

Interpolation methods, as the name implies, can return a score that is between scores in the distribution. Algorithms used by statistical programs typically use interpolation methods, for example, the percentile.exc and percentile.inc functions in Microsoft Excel. The Interpolated Methods table shows the computational steps.

===The nearest-rank method===

One definition of percentile, often given in texts, is that the &quot;P&quot;-th percentile formula_2 of a list of &quot;N&quot; ordered values (sorted from least to greatest) is the smallest value in the list such that no more than &quot;P&quot; percent of the data is strictly less than the value and at least &quot;P&quot; percent of the data is less than or equal to that value. This is obtained by first calculating the ordinal rank and then taking the value from the ordered list that corresponds to that rank. The ordinal rank &quot;n&quot; is calculated using this formula
: formula_3
* Using the nearest-rank method on lists with fewer than 100 distinct values can result in the same value being used for more than one percentile.
* A percentile calculated using the nearest-rank method will always be a member of the original ordered list.
* The 100th percentile is defined to be the largest value in the ordered list.

===The linear interpolation between closest ranks method===
An alternative to rounding used in many applications is to use linear interpolation between adjacent ranks.

All of the following variants have the following in common. Given the order statistics
: formula_4
we seek a linear interpolation function that passes through the points formula_5. This is simply accomplished by
: formula_6
where formula_7 uses the floor function to represent the integral part of positive , whereas formula_8 uses the mod function to represent its fractional part (the remainder after division by 1). (Note that, though at the endpoint formula_9, formula_10 is undefined, it does not need to be because it is multiplied by formula_11.) As we can see, is the continuous version of the subscript , linearly interpolating between adjacent nodes.

There are two ways in which the variant approaches differ. The first is in the linear relationship between the &quot;rank&quot; , the &quot;percent rank&quot; formula_12, and a constant that is a function of the sample size :
: formula_13
There is the additional requirement that the midpoint of the range formula_14, corresponding to the median, occur at formula_15:
: formula_16
and our revised function now has just one degree of freedom, looking like this:
: formula_17
The second way in which the variants differ is in the definition of the function near the margins of the formula_18 range of : formula_19 should produce, or be forced to produce, a result in the range formula_20, which may mean the absence of a one-to-one correspondence in the wider region. One author has suggested a choice of formula_21 where is the shape of the Generalized extreme value distribution which is the extreme value limit of the sampled distribution.

====First variant, &quot;C&quot; = 1/2====

(Sources: Matlab &quot;prctile&quot; function,)
: formula_22
where
: formula_23
: formula_24
Furthermore, let
: formula_25
The inverse relationship is restricted to a narrower region:
: formula_26

====Second variant, &quot;C&quot; = 1====
[Source: Some software packages, including NumPy and Microsoft Excel (up to and including version 2013 by means of the PERCENTILE.INC function). Noted as an alternative by NIST.]

: formula_27
: formula_28
Note that the formula_29 relationship is one-to-one for formula_30, the only one of the three variants with this property; hence the &quot;INC&quot; suffix, for &quot;inclusive&quot;, on the Excel function.

====Third variant, &quot;C&quot; = 0====

(The primary variant recommended by NIST. Adopted by Microsoft Excel since 2010 by means of PERCENTIL.EXC function. However, as the &quot;EXC&quot; suffix indicates, the Excel version &quot;excludes&quot; both endpoints of the range of &quot;p&quot;, i.e., formula_31, whereas the &quot;INC&quot; version, the second variant, does not; in fact, any number smaller than formula_32 is also excluded and would cause an error.)

: formula_33
The inverse is restricted to a narrower region:
: formula_34

===The weighted percentile method===

In addition to the percentile function, there is also a &quot;weighted percentile&quot;, where the percentage in the total weight is counted instead of the total number. There is no standard function for a weighted percentile. One method extends the above approach in a natural way.

Suppose we have positive weights formula_35 associated, respectively, with our &quot;N&quot; sorted sample values. Let
: formula_36
the sum of the weights. Then the formulas above are generalized by taking
: formula_37 when formula_38,
or
: formula_39 for general formula_40,
and
: formula_41

The 50% weighted percentile is known as the weighted median.

<text>Core is the debut studio album by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots, released by Atlantic Records on September 29, 1992.

Produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Core&quot; became a massive commercial success, reaching number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 by July 1993 and has since been certified 8× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album spawned four hit singles including &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot;, &quot;Wicked Garden&quot;, &quot;Creep&quot;, and &quot;Plush&quot;: the latter reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks, with the music video receiving heavy rotation on MTV. Stone Temple Pilots would go on to win two awards for &quot;Plush&quot;: an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist and a Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance.

The album initially received poor reviews despite its commercial success; the band was criticized for allegedly copying the musical style of other alternative acts, particularly Pearl Jam. Retrospectively, &quot;Core&quot; has been acknowledged as a seminal release of the alternative rock and grunge movement of the early 1990s. &quot;Core&quot; helped propel Stone Temple Pilots into the mainstream and remains their most commercially successful record. A 25th anniversary deluxe edition was released in 2017.

==Background and recording==
In 1985, Scott Weiland and his friends in their band Soi Disant – guitarist Corey Hicock and drummer David Allin – first encountered Robert Deleo playing live at various gigs, deciding to track him down after witnessing his shows. Weiland and DeLeo would both move into an apartment in San Diego where they would begin to write music together and formed the band Swing. By 1989, drummer Eric Kretz and DeLeo&#x27;s older brother who was a guitarist, Dean would join the band, which was renamed Mighty Joe Young. The band put out a demo in 1990 and slowly developed a huge following in the alternative rock scene of Southern California.

In the meantime, the band members would take on jobs to support themselves with Weiland working at a modeling agency and Robert at a guitar shop. Robert later said in 2017 that two would write songs during their spare time saying, &quot;When either one of us had a musical idea, we&#x27;d call each other. He would usually have more time to run over and work it out. It was perfect because, since I was at a guitar shop, I could pick up a guitar right there. Scott didn&#x27;t really play an instrument. When he had an idea, he would hum it to me.&quot;

By the beginning of 1992, Mighty Joe Young had earned a reputation in the San Diego and Hollywood club scene. The band caught the attention of A&amp;R executive Tom Carolan who worked at Atlantic Records during their show at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles on April 1. Mighty Joe Young and producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien, who recently mixed &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, entered Rumbo Recorders the next month where they finished recording in a three-week period. Dean said of the recording process, &quot;It was an amazing time, man. It was so beautiful. And that was some of my greatest memories of Scott. He was so on his game and he was so healthy. He was electric and vibrant. There was an innocence, yet a determination with all of us.”

When the recording sessions ended, the band named the album &quot;Core&quot;, which refers to the story of Adam and Eve in the Bible. This is further represented in the album cover which depicts Eve stealing an apple from the Tree of Eden. Robert DeLeo would record the album with a blue G&amp;L L2000 Jazz Bass played on an Ampeg SVT with a Sennheiser 421. Eric Kretz would play on a Yamaha Rock Tour Custom drumset while Dean DeLeo used a 1978 Les Paul Standard. By August, &quot;Core&quot; was scheduled to be released and the album had reached the mastering stage when the band&#x27;s lawyer received word that a blues musician had already claimed the name Mighty Joe Young. Weiland, who was a fan of the STP Motor Oil stickers since his youth gave the band some ideas. Dean even suggested the name Stereo Temple Pirates which eventually would change into the name Stone Temple Pilots.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Core&quot; displayed the determination the band had to mix the hard rock approach of the 1970s and the alternative rock sound with a diverse range of other musical influences. According to Weiland, the band found inspiration in the music of Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Metallica, and Led Zeppelin. Tracks such as &quot;Dead &amp; Bloated&quot;, &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot;, &quot;Piece of Pie&quot;, and &quot;Crackerman&quot; explored a heavy edge combined with alternative tunings similar to Soundgarden and Alice In Chains, while &quot;Wicked Garden&quot;, &quot;Sin&quot;, &quot;Creep&quot;, and &quot;Plush&quot; shared a jazzy and psychedelic tone within the chord progressions.

The lyrical theme of the album is confusion within humanity. Weiland would further elaborate saying, &quot;I guess I tend to find the darker shades of life more attractive than the yellows and oranges. I know it&#x27;s something that I relate to when I listen to music. There&#x27;s no way you can plan anything that happens. It would be hard for me to make an assessment of what it is people are attracted to. We&#x27;re in a really shaky sort of social climate with all these different variables coming into play. So much racial discontent, so much anger from groups that have been discriminating against for so many years. There&#x27;s a handful of people who are making music with a sort of public conscience, and I think it&#x27;s just something that people relate to because of discontent.&quot;

&quot;Sex Type Thing&quot; was an anti-rape song written about abuse of power and control. &quot;Wicked Garden&quot; dealt with lost innocence, &quot;Sin&quot; focused on confusion, and &quot;Naked Sunday&quot; was about organized religion. Weiland stated, &quot;They switch off people&#x27;s minds and control the masses. It gives me a feeling of isolation, when I think about it. Organized religion does not view everyone as equals.&quot; &quot;Creep&quot;, which reflected on alienation had different verses when it was released as a single.

&quot;Piece of Pie&quot; originated from a demo called &quot;Only Dying&quot;. It was supposed to be the band&#x27;s contribution to the soundtrack of &quot;The Crow&quot; but was later pulled in the aftermath of actor Brandon Lee&#x27;s death. &quot;Big Empty&quot;, which was the first single to their second album &quot;Purple&quot;, was used as its replacement. The lyrics for &quot;Plush&quot; were written in a hot tub and used a real life story about a woman who was kidnapped and later found dead in the early 90s, which acts as a metaphor for a lost relationship. Kretz even mentioned the Day of the Dead festival as an inspiration, as well as the band&#x27;s uncertainty about their future.

== Release ==
&quot;Core&quot; was released on September 29, 1992. It would be certified gold on April 20, 1993, and certified platinum on June 9, 1993: the album has since gone platinum eight times. The album peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on July 3, 1993. Stone Temple Pilots would set out on a tour, opening for Rage Against the Machine and Megadeth. The lead single &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot; would be released in December 1992, preceding the tour and would receive medium rotation on MTV. &quot;Plush&quot; was the band&#x27;s breakthrough single, reaching number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks and the music video would see the band win both an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in 1993 and a Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance in March 1994.

&quot;Creep&quot; would be the third single and would peak at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Charts. The band would also promote &quot;Core&quot; with an American and European tour. In November 1993, the band appeared on a &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; episode which aired in January 1994. The performance was never released as a standalone album and was only available in bootleg form for many years, until it was featured on the deluxe reissue of &quot;Core&quot; in 2017.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Core&quot; was initially ignored by critics upon its release. However, the band would start to gain notoriety as the album began receiving heavy airplay. Critics accused the band of allegedly stealing the musical sound of other popular alternative rock acts, primarily Pearl Jam. The lead single &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot; also garnered controversy with many claiming the lyrics as being supportive of date-rape. Deborah Frost of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that the song was, &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s rape defense transcribed into grunge rock. It&#x27;s unclear whether STP, which sounds like it has crash-landed Pearl Jam into Alice in Chains, is condemning or identifying with its narrator. With a real point of view, this band could be bigger than an accident.&quot;

Paul Evans of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; concluded that the &quot;inner child of Stone Temple Pilots is Iron Maiden, and that kid just won&#x27;t quit howling.&quot; Don Kaye of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; praised the band&#x27;s &quot;confidence and identity,&quot; unusual in debut albums. Jeremy Clarke of &quot;Select&quot; also gave a positive review saying, &quot;&quot;Core&quot; is the real thing - a tough, loaded and listenable set with enough identity to pre-empt accusations of copycat tail-chasing. What makes STP matter isn&#x27;t just their sound, but that they&#x27;re a respectable attempt at metal with brains.&quot;

The increasing divide between the band&#x27;s critics and fans was shown in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; issue in January 1994 in which the magazine&#x27;s critics and readers labeled Stone Temple Pilots as the Worst and Best New Band respectively. During the band&#x27;s reunion in 2008, Weiland reflected on the initial mixed reviews of &quot;Core&quot;, saying to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;It was really painful in the beginning because I just assumed that the critics would understand where we were coming from, and that these just weren&#x27;t dumb rock songs.

== Legacy ==
In the years since its release, &quot;Core&quot; has experienced a positive reevaluation. Several publications have considered &quot;Core&quot; as a standout and one of the seminal albums of the alternative rock scene of the early 1990s such as Ric Albano of &quot;Classic Rock Review&quot; who stated that, &quot;the very fact that so many of the songs on &quot;Core&quot; have held up over the past two decades is testament to the quality of this material.&quot; Writing for &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, Emma Johnston wrote, &quot;STP always encouraged their own hype, so this fully-stocked monument to their introduction to the world is a fitting one.&quot;

The singles &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot;, &quot;Wicked Garden&quot;, &quot;Creep&quot;, and &quot;Plush&quot; continue to be rock radio staples in the United States. &quot;Core&quot; was ranked number ten (preceded by Eric Clapton&#x27;s acoustic live album &quot;Unplugged&quot;) on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1992. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at No. 11 on its list of the &quot;50 Greatest Grunge Albums&quot; in 2019

&quot;Core&quot; helped propel Stone Temple Pilots into the mainstream. A 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of &quot;Core&quot; which has a remastered version of the album, previously unreleased demos and b-sides, in addition to parts of three live performances from 1993 (Castaic Lake Natural Amphitheater, Reading Festival, and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;) was released on September 29, 2017. &quot;Core&quot; remains Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; best-selling album.

<text>The silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), also known by numerous names such as blackspot shark, gray whaler shark, olive shark, ridgeback shark, sickle shark, sickle-shaped shark and sickle silk shark, is a species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, named for the smooth texture of its skin. It is one of the most abundant sharks in the pelagic zone, and can be found around the world in tropical waters. Highly mobile and migratory, this shark is most often found over the edge of the continental shelf down to . The silky shark has a slender, streamlined body and typically grows to a length of . It can be distinguished from other large requiem sharks by its relatively small first dorsal fin with a curving rear margin, its tiny second dorsal fin with a long free rear tip, and its long, sickle-shaped pectoral fins. It is a deep, metallic bronze-gray above and white below.

With prey often scarce in its oceanic environment, the silky shark is a swift, inquisitive, and persistent hunter. It feeds mainly on bony fishes and cephalopods, and has been known to drive them into compacted schools before launching open-mouthed, slashing attacks. This species often trails schools of tuna, a favored prey. Its sense of hearing is extremely acute, allowing it to localize the low-frequency noises generated by other feeding animals, and, by extension, sources of food. The silky shark is viviparous, meaning that the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. Significant geographical variation is seen in its life history details. Reproduction occurs year-round except in the Gulf of Mexico, where it follows a seasonal cycle. Females give birth to litters of up to 16 pups annually or biennially. The newborn sharks spend their first months in relatively sheltered reef nurseries on the outer continental shelf, growing substantially before moving into the open ocean.

The large size and cutting teeth of the silky shark make it potentially dangerous, and it has behaved aggressively towards divers. However, attacks are rare, as few humans enter its oceanic habitat. Silky sharks are valued for their fins, and to a lesser extent their meat, hide, liver oil, and jaws. Because of their abundance, they form a major component of commercial and artisanal shark fisheries in many countries. Furthermore, their association with tuna results in many sharks being taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries. Although slow-reproducing like most other sharks, the wide distribution and large population of the silky shark was once thought to buffer the species against fishing pressures. However, data suggest that silky shark numbers are declining around the world, which prompted the IUCN to reassess its conservation status to Vulnerable in 2017.

==Taxonomy==

A scientific description of the silky shark was first published by the German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle under the name &quot;Carcharias (Prionodon) falciformis&quot;, in their 1839 &quot;Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen&quot;. Subsequent authors have assigned this species to the genus &quot;Carcharhinus&quot;. Because Müller and Henle&#x27;s type specimen was a 53-cm-long female fetus from Cuba, adult silky sharks were historically not recognized as &quot;C. falciformis&quot; and were described as a separate species, &quot;Carcharhinus floridanus&quot;, by Henry Bigelow, William Schroeder, and Stewart Springer in 1943. Jack Garrick, Richard Backus, and Robert Gibbs Jr. synonymized &quot;C. floridanus&quot; with &quot;C. falciformis&quot; in 1964.

The specific epithet &quot;falciformis&quot; is Latin for &quot;sickle-shaped&quot;, which refers to the outline of the dorsal and pectoral fins. The silky shark&#x27;s common name comes from the fine texture of its skin compared to other sharks, a product of its tiny, densely packed dermal denticles. It may also be referred to as blackspot shark (usually used for &quot;C. sealei&quot;), grey reef shark (usually used for &quot;C. amblyrhynchos&quot;), grey whaler shark, olive shark, reef shark, ridgeback shark, sickle shark, sickle silk shark, sickle-shaped shark, silk shark, and silky whaler.

==Phylogeny and evolution==

Fossilized teeth belonging to the silky shark have been found in North Carolina: from the vicinity of two baleen whales, one in mud dating to the Pleistocene-Holocene (&quot;circa&quot; 12,000 years ago) and the other in Goose Creek Limestone dating to the Late Pliocene (&quot;circa&quot; 3.5 million years ago – Mya), as well as from the Pungo River, dating to the Miocene (23–5.3 Mya). Fossil teeth have also been found in Pliocene strata at the Cava Serredi quarry in Tuscany, Italy. &quot;Carcharhinus elongatus&quot;, an earlier representative of its lineage with smooth-edged teeth, is known from Oligocene (34–23 Mya) deposits in the Old Church formation of Virginia, and the Ashley formation of South Carolina. A set of poorly described, Eocene (56–34 Mya) teeth resembling those of this species are known from Egypt.

Initial efforts to resolve the evolutionary relationships of the silky shark were inconclusive; based on morphology, Jack Garrick in 1982 suggested the blackspot shark (&quot;C. sealei&quot;) as its closest relative. In 1988, Leonard Compagno assigned it phenetically to an informal &quot;transitional group&quot; also containing the blacknose shark (&quot;C. acronotus&quot;), the blacktip reef shark (&quot;C. melanopterus&quot;), the nervous shark (&quot;C. cautus&quot;), the copper shark (&quot;C. brachyurus&quot;), and the night shark (&quot;C. signatus&quot;).

More recently, Gavin Naylor&#x27;s 1992 phylogenetic analysis, based on allozyme sequence data, found that the silky shark is part of a group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins. One branch within this group contains the sandbar shark (&quot;C. plumbeus&quot;) and the bignose shark (&quot;C. altimus&quot;), while the silky shark is the basal member of the other branch and the sister taxon to a clade containing the Caribbean reef shark (&quot;C. perezi&quot;), Galapagos shark (&quot;C. galapagensis&quot;), oceanic whitetip shark (&quot;C. longimanus&quot;), dusky shark (&quot;C. obscurus&quot;), and blue shark (&quot;Prionace glauca&quot;). Mine Dosay-Abkulut&#x27;s 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis, which included the silky, blue, and bignose sharks, confirmed the closeness of those three species.

==Distribution and habitat==

The silky shark has a cosmopolitan distribution in marine waters warmer than . In the Atlantic Ocean, it is found from Massachusetts (USA) to Spain in the north, and from southern Brazil to northern Angola in the south, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. In the Mediterranean Sea, it has been recorded first in the Alboran Sea, subsequently in Algerian waters, the Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia) and more recently in the Ligurian Sea. It occurs throughout the Indian Ocean, as far south as Mozambique in the west and Western Australia in the east, including the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. In the Pacific Ocean, the northern extent of its range runs from southern China and Japan to southern Baja California and the Gulf of California, while the southern extent runs from Sydney, Australia, to northern New Zealand to northern Chile. Based on life history differences, four distinct populations of silky sharks have been identified in ocean basins worldwide: in the northwestern Atlantic, in the western and central Pacific, in the eastern Pacific, and in the Indian Ocean.

Primarily an inhabitant of the open ocean, the silky shark is most common from the surface to a depth of , but may dive to or more. Tracking studies in the tropical eastern Pacific and northern Gulf of Mexico have found that cruising silky sharks spend 99% of their time within of the surface, and 80–85% of their time in water with a temperature of ; the pattern was constant regardless of day or night. This species favors the edges of continental and insular shelves, often over deepwater reefs and around islands. Its range extends farther north and south along continental margins than in oceanic waters. On occasion, it may venture into coastal waters as shallow as . Silky sharks are highly mobile and migratory, though the details of their movements are little-known. Tagging data have recorded individual sharks moving up to per day, and covering distances up to . Larger sharks generally move longer distances than smaller ones. In the Pacific Ocean and possibly elsewhere, it spends the summer at slightly higher latitudes, particularly during warmer El Niño years. In the northern Atlantic, most sharks follow the Gulf Stream northward along the U.S. East Coast. In the Gulf of Aden, it is most common in late spring and summer.

==Description==

Slim and streamlined, the silky shark has a fairly long, rounded snout with barely developed flaps of skin in front of the nostrils. The circular, medium-sized eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Short, shallow furrows are present at the corners of the mouth. 14–16 and 13–17 tooth rows are found on either side of the upper and lower jaws, respectively (typically 15 for both). The upper teeth are triangular and strongly serrated, with a notch in the posterior edge; they are erect at the center and become more oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth are narrow, erect, and smooth-edged. The five pairs of gill slits are moderate in length.

The dorsal and pectoral fins are distinctive and help to distinguish the silky shark from similar species. The first dorsal fin is relatively small, measuring less than a tenth as high as the shark is long, and originates behind the free rear tips of the pectoral fins. It has a rounded apex, an S-shaped rear margin, and a free rear tip about half as long as the fin is tall. The second dorsal fin is tiny, smaller than the anal fin, with a drawn-out free rear tip up to three times as long as the fin is tall. A narrow dorsal ridge runs between the dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are narrow and sickle-shaped, and particularly long in adults. The anal fin originates slightly ahead of the second dorsal fin and has a deep notch in the posterior margin. The caudal fin is fairly high with a well-developed lower lobe.

The skin is densely covered by minute, overlapping dermal denticles. Each dermal denticle is diamond-shaped and bears horizontal ridges leading to posterior marginal teeth, which increase in number as the shark grows. The back is metallic golden-brown to dark gray and the belly is snowy white, which extends onto the flank as a faint lighter stripe. The fins (except for the first dorsal) darken at the tips; this is more obvious in young sharks. The coloration quickly fades to a dull gray after death. One of the largest members of its genus, the silky shark commonly reaches a length of , with a maximum recorded length and weight of and , respectively. Females grow larger than males.

==Biology and ecology==
The silky shark is one of the three most common pelagic sharks along with the blue and oceanic whitetip sharks, and counts among the most numerous large oceanic animals in the world with a population of at least tens of millions. Compared to the other two species, it is less strictly pelagic with the greatest numbers found in offshore waters associated with land, where food is more readily obtained than farther out in the truly open ocean. The silky shark is an active, inquisitive, and aggressive predator, though it will defer to the slower but more powerful oceanic whitetip shark in competitive situations. When approaching something of interest, it may seem inattentive, sedately circling and sometimes swinging its head from side to side. However, it can respond with startling swiftness to any shift in its immediate surroundings. This shark is often found around floating objects such as logs or tethered naval buoys.

Younger silky sharks are known to form large, loosely organized aggregations, possibly for mutual defense. During migrations, over a thousand individuals may gather. These groups are generally segregated by size, and in the Pacific perhaps also by sex. Silky sharks within a group have been observed to &quot;tilt&quot;, presenting their full lateral profile towards each other, as well as gape their jaws or puff out their gills. On occasion, sharks have also been seen suddenly charging straight up, veering away just before reaching the surface and gliding back down to deeper water. The significance of these behaviors is unknown. When confronted, the silky shark may perform a threat display, in which it arches its back, drops its tail and pectoral fins, and elevates its head. The shark then proceeds to swim in tight loops with a stiff, jerky motion, often turning broadside towards the perceived threat.

Potential predators of the silky shark include larger sharks and killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;). Known parasites of this shark include the isopod &quot;Gnathia trimaculata&quot;, the copepod &quot;Kroeyerina cortezensis&quot;, and the tapeworms &quot;Dasyrhynchus variouncinatus&quot; and &quot;Phyllobothrium&quot; sp. Silky sharks frequently intermingle with schools of scalloped hammerheads (&quot;Sphyrna lewini&quot;), and have been known to follow marine mammals. One account from the Red Sea describes 25 silky sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops&quot; sp.), along with 25 grey reef sharks (&quot;C. amblyrhynchos&quot;) and a lone silvertip shark (&quot;C. albimarginatus&quot;). Silky sharks are themselves accompanied by juvenile pilot fish (&quot;Naucrates ductor&quot;), which &quot;ride&quot; the pressure wave ahead of the shark, as well as by jacks, which snatch scraps of food and rub against the shark&#x27;s skin to scrape off parasites.

===Feeding===

The silky shark is an opportunistic predator, feeding mainly on bony fishes from all levels of the water column, including tuna, mackerel, sardines, mullets, groupers, snappers, mackerel scads, sea chubs, sea catfish, eels, lanternfishes, filefishes, triggerfishes, and porcupinefishes. It may also take squid, paper nautilus, and swimming crabs, and fossil evidence indicates it scavenged on whale carcasses. Good feeding opportunities can draw silky sharks in large numbers; one such feeding aggregation in the Pacific has been documented &quot;herding&quot; a school of small fishes into a compact mass (a bait ball) and trapping it against the surface, whereupon the sharks consumed the entire school. When attacking tightly packed fish, silky sharks charge through the ball and slash open-mouthed, catching the prey fish at the corners of their jaws. Although multiple individuals may feed at once, each launches its attack independently.

Studies conducted off the Florida coast and the Bahamas have shown that silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20 Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they are similar to the noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.

The bite force of a 2-m-long silky shark has been measured at . A well-established association exists between this species and tuna: off Ghana, almost every tuna school has silky sharks trailing behind, and in the eastern Pacific, these sharks inflict such damage to tuna fishing gear and catches that fishery workers have given them the moniker &quot;net-eating sharks&quot;. Silky sharks and bottlenose dolphins compete when both species target the same school of fish; the amount eaten by the dolphins decreases relative to the number of sharks present. If a large number of sharks is present, they tend to remain inside the prey school, while the dolphins consign themselves to the periphery, possibly to avoid incidental injury from the sharks&#x27; slashing attacks. Conversely, if a large enough group of dolphins gathers, they become able to chase the sharks away from the prey school. Regardless of which one dominates, the two predators do not engage in any overtly aggressive behavior against each other.

===Life history===

Like other members of its family, the silky shark is viviparous: once the developing embryo exhausts its supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Relative to other viviparous sharks, the placenta of the silky shark is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no interdigitation exists between the tissues of the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri, which are divided lengthwise into separate compartments for each embryo.

Silky sharks in most parts of the world are thought to reproduce year-round, whereas mating and birthing in the Gulf of Mexico take place in late spring or early summer (May to August). However, in some cases, the presence of reproductive seasonality may have been obscured by biases in data collection. Females give birth after a gestation period of 12 months, either every year or every other year. The litter size ranges from one to 16 and increases with female size, with six to 12 being typical. The pups are born in reef nursery areas on the outer continental shelf, where ample food supplies and protection from large pelagic sharks occur. The risk of predation has selected for fast growth in young sharks, which add to their length within their first year of life. After a few months (or by the first winter in the Gulf of Mexico), the now-subadult sharks migrate out from the nursery into the open ocean.

The life history characteristics of the silky shark differ across its range (see table). Northwestern Atlantic sharks tend to be larger than those in the western-central Pacific at all ages, while eastern Pacific sharks tend to be smaller than sharks in other regions. Eastern Atlantic and Indian Ocean sharks seem to match or exceed the size of northwestern Atlantic sharks, but the figures are based on relatively few individuals and more data are needed.

The overall growth rate of the silky shark is moderate compared to other shark species and similar for both sexes, though it varies significantly between individuals. One central Pacific study has found females growing much slower than males, but the results may have been skewed by missing data from large females. The highest reported growth rates are from sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the lowest from sharks off northeastern Taiwan. Males and females reach sexual maturity at ages of 6–10 years and 7–12+ years, respectively. Sharks from more temperate waters may grow slower and mature later than those in warmer regions. The maximum lifespan is at least 22 years.

==Human interactions==

Given its formidable size and dentition, the silky shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans. However, it only rarely comes into contact with people due to its oceanic habits. Its natural curiosity and boldness may lead it to repeatedly and closely approach divers, and it can become dangerously excited in the presence of food. The silky shark tends to be more aggressive if encountered on a reef than in open water. Cases of individual sharks persistently harassing divers and even forcing them out of the water have been reported. As of May 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists six attacks attributable to the silky shark, three of them unprovoked and none fatal.

Large numbers of silky sharks are caught by commercial and artisanal multispecies shark fisheries operating off Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the United States, Ecuador, Spain, Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Yemen, and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. Even greater numbers are caught incidentally by tuna longline and purse seine fisheries throughout its range, particularly those using fish aggregating devices. It is the most common shark caught as bycatch in the eastern Pacific and Gulf of Mexico tuna fisheries, and the second-most common shark caught as bycatch (next to the blue shark) overall. The fins are valued as an ingredient in shark fin soup, with captured sharks often finned at sea and the rest of the body discarded. Fins from an estimated one-half to one and a half million silky sharks are traded globally per year; it is the second- or third-most common species auctioned on the Hong Kong fin market, which represents over half the global trade. The meat (sold fresh or dried and salted), skin, and liver oil may also be used, as well as the jaws: this species is the predominant source of dried shark jaw curios sold to tourists in the tropics. Some sport fishers catch silky sharks.

===Conservation===
As one of the most abundant and widely distributed sharks on Earth, the silky shark was once thought to be mostly immune to depletion despite heavy fishing mortality. In 1989 alone, some 900,000 individuals were taken as bycatch in the southern and central Pacific tuna longline fishery, seemingly without effect on the total population. Fishery data on this shark are often confounded by under-reporting, lack of species-level separation, and problematic identification. Nevertheless, mounting evidence indicates the silky shark has, in fact, declined substantially worldwide, a consequence of its modest reproductive rate which is unable to sustain such high levels of exploitation. The total annual catch reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization fell steadily from 11,680 tons in 2000 to 4,358 tons in 2004. Regional assessments have found similar trends, estimating declines of some 90% in the central Pacific from the 1950s to the 1990s, 60% off Costa Rica from 1991 to 2000, 91% in the Gulf of Mexico from the 1950s to the 1990s, and 85% (for all large requiem sharks) in the northwestern Atlantic from 1986 to 2005. The silky shark fishery off Sri Lanka reported a drop from a peak catch of 25,400 tons in 1994 to only 1,960 tons in 2006, indicative of a local stock collapse. However, Japanese fisheries in the Pacific and Indian Oceans have recorded no change in catch rate between the 1970s and the 1990s, and the validity of the methodologies used to assess declines in the Gulf of Mexico and the northwestern Atlantic have come under much debate.

As of 2017, the silky shark is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a vulnerable species. The silky shark is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, though this has yet to result in any management schemes. The species should benefit from bans on shark finning, which are being increasingly implemented by nations and supranational entities, including the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Organizations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission have also taken steps to improve fishery monitoring, with the ultimate goal of reducing shark bycatch. However, given the highly migratory nature of the silky shark and its association with tuna, no simple way is known to reduce bycatch without also affecting the economics of the fishery.

<text>The western olivaceous warbler (Iduna opaca), also known as isabelline warbler, is a &quot;warbler&quot;, formerly placed in the Old World warblers when these were a paraphyletic wastebin taxon. It is now considered a member of the acrocephaline warblers, Acrocephalidae, in the tree warbler genus &quot;Iduna&quot;. It was formerly regarded as part of a wider &quot;olivaceous warbler&quot; species, but as a result of modern taxonomic developments, this species is now usually considered distinct from the eastern olivaceous warbler, &quot;Iduna pallida&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

It is a small passerine bird, found in dry open country, including cultivation, with bushes or some trees. Two or three eggs are laid in a nest in low undergrowth or a bush. Like most warblers, the western olivaceous warbler is insectivorous.

It is a medium-sized warbler, more like a very pale reed warbler than its relative the melodious warbler. The adults have a plain pale brown back and whitish underparts. Its body length is about , wingspan and weight . The bill is strong and pointed and the legs grey. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are more buff on the belly.

This species doesn&#x27;t wiggle its tail or does it uncommonly. Western olivaceous warbler searches for food at different heights.

It breeds in Iberia and north Africa. It is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a rare vagrant to northern Europe.

The western olivaceous warbler is larger and has a browner tinge to the upperparts than the eastern olivaceous warbler. It also has a larger bill. The song is a fast nasal babbling.

==Distribution==

===North Africa===

The western olivaceous warbler occurs mainly as a passage migrant in southeast Morocco, although it also may breed in some densely vegetated areas there.

<text>The eastern olivaceous warbler (Iduna pallida), known simply as the olivaceous warbler when its western relative is referred to as the &#x27;Isabelline warbler&#x27;, is a small passerine bird with drab plumage tones, that is native to the Old World. For the most part it breeds in southeastern Europe, the Middle East and adjacent western Asia, and winters in the northern Afrotropics.

==Taxonomy==
The eastern olivaceous warbler (&quot;Iduna pallida&quot;) is a &quot;warbler&quot;, formerly placed in the Old World warblers when these were a paraphyletic wastebin taxon. It is now considered a member of the acrocephaline warblers, Acrocephalidae, in the tree warbler genus &quot;Iduna&quot;. It was formerly regarded as part of a wider &quot;olivaceous warbler&quot; species, but as a result of modern taxonomic developments, this species is now usually considered distinct from the western olivaceous warbler, &quot;Iduna opaca&quot;.

==Etymology==
Keyserling and Blasius gave no explanation of the genus name &quot;Iduna&quot;. The specific &quot;pallida&quot; is Latin for &quot;pale&quot;.

==Habits==
This small passerine bird is found in dry open country, including cultivation, with bushes or some trees. Like most warblers it is insectivorous.

==Range==
It is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa or Arabia. It is a rare vagrant to northern Europe.

==Breeding==

The eastern olivaceous warbler breeds from southeastern Europe and the Middle East to western Asia, and the subspecies &quot;reiseri&quot; is thought to be locally common as a breeding species in southeast Morocco. Two or three eggs are laid in a nest which is placed low in a bush or in undergrowth.

==Description==
It is a medium-sized warbler, more like a very pale reed warbler than its relative the melodious warbler. The adult has a plain pale brown back and whitish underparts. The bill is strong and pointed and the legs grey. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are more buff on the belly. It has a characteristic downward tail flick.

The western olivaceous warbler differs from this species in being larger and having a browner tinge to the upperparts; it also has a larger bill. The eastern olivaceous warbler sometimes has a greenish tinge to its upperparts, and can be very difficult to separate from Sykes&#x27;s warbler, &quot;Iduna rama&quot;. The song is a fast nasal babbling.

<text>Walter Emmons Alston (December 1, 1911 – October 1, 1984), nicknamed &quot;Smokey&quot;, was an American baseball manager in Major League Baseball who managed the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers from 1954 through 1976, signing 23 one-year contracts with the Regarded as one of the greatest managers in baseball history, Alston was known for his calm, reticent demeanor, for which he was sometimes referred to as &quot;the Quiet Man.&quot;

Born and raised in rural Ohio, Alston lettered in baseball and basketball at Miami University in Oxford. A journeyman whose MLB playing career consisted of only one game–two innings played, and one at-bat with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1936–Alston spent 19 years in the minor leagues as a player, player-manager and non-playing manager. His service included a stint as manager of the 1946 Nashua Dodgers, the first U.S.-based integrated professional team in modern baseball. After six successful seasons as manager of Brooklyn&#x27;s Triple-A teams, the St. Paul Saints and Montreal Royals, Alston was promoted to manage the Dodgers in 1954.

As a major league manager, Alston led Dodger teams to seven National League (NL) pennants and four World Series titles, including the only championship title won while the club was still in Brooklyn. After 23 seasons, Alston retired with over 2,000 career wins and had been selected as Manager of the Year six times. He also managed NL All-Star teams to seven victories. Alston&#x27;s number 24 was retired by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977. In 1983, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame but was unable to attend his induction ceremony after suffering a heart attack that year and being hospitalized for a month. He never fully recovered and died in Oxford, Ohio, on 

==Early life==
Walter Emmons Alston was born on December 1, 1911, in Venice, Ohio. Alston spent much of his childhood on a farm in Morning Sun; when he was a teenager, the family moved to Darrtown.

Alston attended Milford Township High School in Darrtown, and received the nickname &quot;Smokey&quot; as a high school pitcher, owing to the speed of his fastball.

He graduated from high school in 1929 and married longtime girlfriend Lela Vaughn Alexander the next year.

In 1935, Alston graduated with a degree in industrial arts and physical education from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. He said that finances were a challenge in college and that he had paid his way through school by playing pool. He lettered three years in both basketball and baseball.

==Playing career==
Alston played minor league baseball as an infielder for the Greenwood Chiefs and Huntington Red Birds in 1935 and 1936, respectively. For the 1936 Huntington team, he hit 35 home runs in 120 games. Alston&#x27;s only major league game was with the St. Louis Cardinals on September 27, 1936, substituting for Johnny Mize at first base. He later described his major league playing career to a reporter by saying, &quot;Well, I came up to bat for the Cards back in &#x27;36, and Lon Warneke struck me out. That&#x27;s it.&quot; He also committed one error in two fielding chances at first base.

Alston returned to the minor leagues after his brief MLB appearance. He split the 1937 season between the Houston Buffaloes and Rochester Red Wings, hitting for a combined .229 batting average. Alston played for the Portsmouth Red Birds in 1938, finishing the season with a .311 average and 28 home runs as Portsmouth won its only Middle Atlantic League championship. He returned to Portsmouth in 1940, hit 28 home runs and was a player-manager for part of the season. He was a player-manager for the next two seasons with the Springfield Cardinals and even appeared in seven games as a pitcher in 1942. He returned to Rochester as a first baseman and third baseman in 1943 then moved to the Trenton Packers, where he was a player-manager in 1944 and 1945. Alston had been offered the job in Trenton, a minor league farm club of the Brooklyn Dodgers, by Branch Rickey, the executive who had signed him as a player with St. Louis.

After his two seasons with Trenton, Alston served as a player-manager for the first integrated U.S. baseball team based in the twentieth century, the Nashua Dodgers of the Class-B New England League. Alston managed black Dodgers prospects Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella, leading Nashua to a New England League title in 1946. Alston later said that he did not give much consideration to racial issues and that he had simply thought about how much they would benefit the team.

Alston led the Pueblo Dodgers to the Western League title the next season. He appeared as a player in two games, which were his final professional playing appearances. For his 13-season minor league playing career, Alston hit .295 with 176 home runs. However, he hit only .239 in 535 at bats in Class AA, which was the highest minor league classification through 1945.

==Managerial career==
===Minor leagues===
In 1948, Alston managed the St. Paul Saints, a Dodgers Class AAA affiliate, to an 86–68 win–loss record. The team finished in third place, 14 games behind an Indianapolis Indians team managed by Al López. That year, Alston managed Campanella again, where Campanella integrated the American Association. The media was critical of Alston for playing Campanella; they said that the catcher was simply there to integrate the league. Campanella hit 13 home runs in 35 games and fans were dismayed when he was called up to the Dodgers. The 1949 Saints finished with a 93-60 record and four of its players collected more than 90 runs batted in (RBI). The team finished in first place, half a game in front of Indianapolis. During the baseball off-season, Alston worked as a teacher in Darrtown.

From 1950 to 1953, Alston managed another Dodgers AAA affiliate, the Montreal Royals of the International League. The team won between 86 and 95 games during each season of Alston&#x27;s tenure. The 1951 and 1952 Montreal Royals won International League pennants. In 1951 and 1953, Montreal won the Governors&#x27; Cup playoff tournament. Alston was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame many years later in 2010.

===Brooklyn Dodgers===
Alston was named manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers for the 1954 season. His predecessor, Chuck Dressen, had moved on from the Dodgers after the team&#x27;s leadership refused to sign him to a two-year or three-year contract. Dressen had won two pennants in three years and nearly won a third.

Dodgers executive Buzzie Bavasi fought for Alston to be hired in Brooklyn. Bringing Alston to Brooklyn has been described as Bavasi&#x27;s biggest contribution to the team&#x27;s history. Alston was an unknown at the major league level and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported his hiring with the headline &quot;Walter Who?&quot;

Becoming immediately known for his quiet nature, Alston was sometimes referred to as &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;. Alston&#x27;s personality contrasted with that of Dressen, who was much more outspoken. Sportswriters had difficulty writing about Alston at first because he did not say much. He also seemed more conservative in his decisions on the field, which drew criticism from his players even though he had managed many of them in the minor leagues. Don Zimmer said that he had learned more from Dressen and that Dressen knew more about baseball than Alston. Jackie Robinson did not like Alston at first either, according to Robinson&#x27;s wife.

Alston commented on his approach, saying, &quot;I never criticized a player for a mistake on the spot. Whenever I got steamed up about something, I always wanted to sleep on it and face the situation with a clear head.&quot; Sportswriter Jim Murray said that Alston was &quot;the only guy in the game who could look Billy Graham right in the face without blushing and who would order corn on the cob in a Paris restaurant.&quot; The 1954 Dodgers finished second in the NL as both Gil Hodges and Duke Snider hit at least 40 home runs and registered 130 runs batted in.

Brooklyn got off to a strong start in 1955, but an Associated Press article noted that Alston was reticent in response to questions and that he did not seem like a manager who had won ten consecutive The Brooklyn Dodgers won the NL pennant and their only World Series championship. They clinched the pennant on earlier than any team had in NL history; at , the Dodgers were 17 games ahead of second place Milwaukee with 16 In the World Series, Johnny Podres, started two games (third and seventh); he had a mediocre regular season record, but won both postseason starts. The pitcher had struggled with arm problems for much of the season.

Sandy Koufax emerged as a pitcher for the Dodgers during that championship season. Alston was criticized by Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, and others over his sparse use of Koufax in his early career. During Koufax&#x27;s second MLB start, he pitched a shutout, giving up two hits and striking out 14 batters. However, that success did not prompt a lot of opportunities for Koufax. The pitcher appeared in only 12 games that season, mostly in relief, and would continue to be used sparingly and inconsistantly by Alston over the next few seasons. Years later, Koufax&#x27;s teammate Don Drysdale told sportswriter Roger Kahn that he suspected that &quot;latent antisemitism&quot; on Alston&#x27;s part likely played a role in the way Koufax, who was Jewish, was used as a young pitcher.

The 1956 team repeated as NL champions; the team was bolstered by the play of Duke Snider, who hit a league-leading 43 home runs and also led the league in walks. Despite winning the first two games of the World Series, the Dodgers lost in seven games to the Yankees. The Dodgers fell to third place in 1957, the final season in Brooklyn.

===Early years in Los Angeles===

The team finished 21 games back in seventh place () in 1958, the club&#x27;s first season in Los Angeles. Criticism of Alston had begun to mount during that season, but he led the Dodgers to a world championship in 1959. Six players on the 1959 team finished with double-digit totals in home runs, while 22-year-old Drysdale led the team&#x27;s pitchers with 17 wins. Several Los Angeles players, including Wally Moon, characterized Alston as indecisive in the late 1950s and 1960s. However, Moon later came to describe Alston as a good manager who had gotten &quot;good mileage&quot; out of his players.

Managing the NL All-Star Team in 1960, Alston attracted some controversy when he left Milwaukee Braves pitchers Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette off the roster. An Associated Press report said the omission may have been a snub directed at Dressen, who was the manager in Milwaukee. The 1960 Dodgers finished in fourth place. The following year, the team finished in second place after veteran Duke Snider missed two months with a broken arm. The Dodgers lost the lead in the 1962 NL pennant race and rumors surfaced that Alston and coach Leo Durocher might be fired, but the team retained both for 1963.

The Dodgers swept the World Series in 1963, the first time that the New York Yankees had lost a World Series in four games. Alston&#x27;s pitchers excelled, with Koufax striking out 23 batters over two games winning the World Series MVP Award. Over the four games, Alston employed only four pitchers: three starters and one reliever. The 1964 team was its first losing season in several years. Alston used the team&#x27;s 1964 performance to motivate them moving forward. In spring training before the 1965 season, he said that he would not let his team forget the difficulties they had in the previous season.

The Dodgers returned to the World Series in 1965 against Minnesota. Alston could not start his number one pitcher, Koufax, in the opening game on October 6 because Koufax was observing Yom Kippur. Instead, Alston turned to Drysdale, who struggled and surrendered seven runs in just 2⅔ innings. When Alston came to the mound to remove him in the bottom of the third, Drysdale quipped, &quot;I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too.&quot; The team recovered from losing that first game and they won the World Series in seven games. Koufax appeared in three games during the series, registering two shutouts.

Alston&#x27;s Dodgers teams of the 1960s benefited from the strong pitching by Drysdale and Koufax. In 1966, both players held out of spring training and demanded three-year contracts each worth $500,000, which was more money than anyone was making in baseball at the time. The players were eventually signed for lesser amounts. Drysdale struggled that year, but Koufax won 27 games. The Dodgers returned to the World Series, but were swept by the Baltimore Orioles. Koufax retired after the season on the advice of doctors who examined his sore arm. Drysdale retired three years later. Both men had pitched their entire major league careers for Alston.

===Final years as manager===

Alston guided his teams to at least 85 wins per season in his last eight years at the helm, with six runner-up finishes in the NL West division during that span. The team came very close to a division title in 1971; after falling 11 games out of first place, the team performed well late in the season and finished one game behind the San Francisco Giants. Beginning in 1973, Alston&#x27;s team featured an infield of Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell, and Ron Cey. The group played together for eight years, remaining together long after the end of Alston&#x27;s tenure.

In 1974, the Dodgers won the NL pennant and faced the two-time defending champion Oakland Athletics in the World Series. Alston used closer Mike Marshall in a record-setting 106 games that season and Marshall won the Cy Young Award. Alston received some media attention when he considered using Marshall as a starter. Marshall ended up appearing in all five games of the series and gave up one run in nine innings, but he did not start a game; the Dodgers lost four games to one as the A&#x27;s completed their three-peat. The 1975 and 1976 teams won 88 and 92 games respectively, but finished well behind Cincinnati in both seasons.

A rift was developing among the Dodger players in the mid-1970s. Garvey was being heavily promoted by the Dodgers&#x27; P.R. staff, and some of his teammates resented the attention, thinking Garvey was trying too hard to get endorsement opportunities. Cey, Lopes, and another unnamed player criticized Garvey in a mid-June 1976 &quot;San Bernardino Sun-Telegram&quot; article, which prompted Alston to call a team meeting. At this meeting, Garvey said, &quot;If anyone has anything to say about me, I want it said to my face, here and now.&quot; No one said anything. Pitcher Tommy John thought it was at this point that Alston began to lose control of the team.

On July 17, 1976, he became the fifth manager to win 2,000 games. In September 1976, Alston announced that he would retire at the end of the season. At a press conference, he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been in baseball for 41 years and it&#x27;s been awfully good to me. This has been a pretty big day. I had three birdies playing golf for the first time in my life and now I&#x27;m announcing that I&#x27;m stepping down as manager. I told Peter this afternoon to give somebody else a chance to manage the club.&quot; When Tommy Lasorda was selected to succeed him, Alston asked Lasorda to take over as manager for the final four games of the season. Alston retired with 2,063 wins (2,040 in the regular season and 23 in the postseason). Alston was named NL Manager of the Year six times. He also managed NL All-Star squads a record nine times and won seven of those games. At a time when multi-year contracts were on the rise, Alston&#x27;s managerial career consisted of 23 one-year contracts. He earned seven NL pennants in that span.

Sportswriter Leonard Koppett described Alston&#x27;s role with the Dodgers, pointing out that O&#x27;Malley was always seen as &quot;the boss&quot; while Alston stuck to the on-field management of the team. Koppett said that Alston&#x27;s loyalty and subdued nature contributed to the stability that the team enjoyed. O&#x27;Malley once commented that Alston was &quot;non-irritating. Do you realize how important it is to have a manager who doesn&#x27;t irritate you?&quot;

==Managerial statistics==
==Later life and legacy==
The Dodgers retired Alston&#x27;s number 24 the year after he stepped down as manager, becoming only the fourth Dodger to receive the honor to that time. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1983. Alston suffered a heart attack that year and was hospitalized for a month. Alston&#x27;s grandson traveled to Cooperstown to represent the ill former manager at the Hall of Fame induction ceremony.

Alston died in an Oxford hospital from complications from the recent heart attack on October 1, 1984. He was 72. A funeral home spokesman said Alston had remained ill since the heart attack. He is interred at Darrtown Cemetery in Darrtown, Ohio.

Upon Alston&#x27;s death, MLB commissioner Peter Ueberroth referred to him as one of baseball&#x27;s greatest managers. Former Dodgers great Duke Snider acknowledged occasional run-ins with Alston, but said Alston excelled at utilizing the specific strengths of each team he had managed.

Broadcaster Vin Scully said of Alston:

Alston is also credited with helping to break down the barriers for female sports journalists. On October 1, 1974, after the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Houston Astros to clinch the NL West at the Houston Astrodome, he invited Anita Martini to the post-game press conference in the locker room. She became the first female journalist allowed in any major league locker room.

In 1999, Ohio State Route 177 was renamed to Walter &quot;Smokey&quot; Alston Memorial Highway in his honor. He was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame in 2010. A memorial to Alston is located at Milford Township Community Park in his hometown of Darrtown.

<doc id="354928" wikidata="Q2310898" url="?curid=354928" title="Purple (Stone Temple Pilots album)">
<text>Purple (stylized on the cover art in its Chinese character 紫, also known as Stone Temple Pilots) is the second studio album by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots, released on June 7, 1994, by Atlantic Records. The album, building on the foundation laid by the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Core&quot; (1992), was a major commercial success, debuting at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 252,000 copies sold in its first week. It remained at the top of the chart for three weeks, eventually selling over six million copies. It spawned a number of successful singles; &quot;Vasoline&quot; and &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; both topped the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and reached number 2 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, while &quot;Big Empty&quot; also reached the top ten on both charts. Lesser-known album cuts &quot;Pretty Penny&quot; and &quot;Unglued&quot; were released as promotional radio singles.

==Background and musical style==
In the spring of 1994, Stone Temple Pilots returned to the studio to work on their next album and completed it in less than a month. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Big Empty&quot;, made its debut at STP&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; acoustic performance in 1993. The song would later appear on the soundtrack to the 1994 Brandon Lee film &quot;The Crow&quot;, which reached number one on the Billboard charts. A couple of weeks later, &quot;Purple&quot; also reached the top of the charts, the band&#x27;s first album to do so.

The lyric &quot;She said she&#x27;d be my woman, she said she&#x27;d be my man&quot; from &quot;Lounge Fly&quot; also appears in the song &quot;Spanish Flies&quot; on the &quot;Mighty Joe Young Demo&quot;. Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers is credited with playing the ending guitar solo on the song.

While &quot;Purple&quot; features elements of grunge like its predecessor, &quot;Core&quot;, the album displays the band developing a sound influenced by other genres, such as the psychedelic rock evident in &quot;Lounge Fly&quot; and &quot;Silvergun Superman&quot;, the country vibes of &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; and blues rock elements of &quot;Big Empty&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover art for the album features a painting of a child riding on a Qilin accompanied by a quintet of fairies above the creature and the child, taking place on a cloudy background. The album title is written as a Chinese character, zǐ (紫), on the cover, and nowhere else on the packaging (with exception of the UK and European limited edition vinyl release). Early pressings featured the Chinese character and band name printed on the CD jewel case cover itself.

On analogue formats (LP and cassette) of the original release, the album title is shown as simply Stone Temple Pilots on the tape shells and LP labels. No track listing appears on the back cover, which instead displays the image of a decorated cake with the phrase 12 Gracious Melodies, which is a clue to a hidden track as song twelve.

On the cover of the cassette version of &quot;Purple&quot;, the child is holding the Chinese character in his hand, rather than positioned in the corner. There are two pressings of the actual disc art of &quot;Purple&quot;. One version has a close-up of the frosted flowers from the cake on the rear panel on it and another has dragon scales.

The vinyl LP release is made from colored vinyl - transparent purple in the US and UK release and a limited edition opaque marbled vinyl in a softer shade of purple available only in the UK and Europe.

==Reception==

&quot;Purple&quot; debuted at number one in the United States upon its release on June 7, 1994. The radio-friendly &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; quickly became a big hit, spending a record-setting fifteen weeks atop the album rock tracks chart. Other hits from the album included &quot;Vasoline&quot; and &quot;Big Empty&quot;. By October, just four months after its release, &quot;Purple&quot; had sold three million copies.

The album received generally positive reviews, with AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that it was a &quot;quantum leap over their debut, showcasing a band hitting its stride&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2005, &quot;Purple&quot; was ranked number 438 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.
In 2006, the album was ranked number 73 on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time. In May 2014, &quot;Loudwire&quot; placed &quot;Purple&quot; at number six on its &quot;10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1994&quot; list. In July 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked &quot;Purple&quot; at number 24 in their &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list. In 2019, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at No. 24 on its list of the &quot;50 Greatest Grunge Albums.&quot; In 2022, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;Purple&quot; one of the 25 Best Grunge Albums of the &#x27;90s.

A 25th anniversary edition of the album was released on October 18, 2019, in several formats including a 1LP/3CD/7 inch super deluxe box set much like the deluxe version of &quot;Core&quot; released in 2017.

<text>Sutardji Calzoum Bachri, known as Tardji, (born 1941 in Rengat, Riau) is a well-known Indonesian poet. A native Malay speaker, he successfully launched a credo of &#x27;freeing words of their meanings&#x27;.

He was nicknamed the &quot;bottle poet&quot; for a preference, early in his career, for accompanying readings of his work with bottles of alcohol. He was also known once as &#x27;The President of Indonesian Poets&#x27; His style of reading has been compared to the incantation-like quality of the old Indonesian &quot;dukun&quot;, chants stemming from Indonesian pre-Islamic shamanistic practice, still used today.

The style of Tardji&#x27;s poetry has been described as that of a &quot;mantra&quot;. He has been quoted as saying that the &quot;mantra&quot; is the true use of words.

<text>The western Bonelli&#x27;s warbler (Phylloscopus bonelli) is a warbler in the leaf warbler genus &quot;Phylloscopus&quot;. It was formerly regarded as the western subspecies of a wider &quot;Bonelli&#x27;s warbler&quot; species, but as a result of modern taxonomic developments, they are now usually considered to be two species:
* Western Bonelli&#x27;s warbler, &quot;Phylloscopus bonelli&quot;, which breeds in southwest Europe and north Africa
* Eastern Bonelli&#x27;s warbler, &quot;Phylloscopus orientalis&quot;, which breeds in southeast Europe and Asia Minor

The breeding ranges of the two species do not overlap; while their appearance and songs are very similar, the calls are completely different (see below). They also show marked difference in mtDNA sequence.

The species is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a rare vagrant in Northern Europe.

The genus name &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;skopos&quot;, &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). The English name and the specific &quot;bonelli&quot; are for the Italian ornithologist Franco Andrea Bonelli.

==Description==

Western Bonelli&#x27;s warbler is a small passerine bird, found in forest and woodland. Four to six eggs are laid in a nest on the ground. The eggs are white with reddish-brown markings and are laid in clutches of 3-5 eggs. The incubation period is around 14 days long, and the chicks fledge after 10-14 days. Cuckoo nest predation and brood parasitism are major hazards to the breeding success of western Bonelli&#x27;s warblers. Like most warblers, western Bonelli&#x27;s warbler is insectivorous.

The adult has a plain grey-green back, green-toned rump and wings and whitish underparts. The bill is small and pointed and the legs brown. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers.

The western Bonelli&#x27;s warbler has a browner tinge to the upperparts than the eastern Bonelli&#x27;s warbler; the latter sometimes has a greenish tinge instead. The song is a fast monotone trill, only slightly different from eastern Bonelli&#x27;s, and also with some similarity to the wood warbler. The call of the western Bonelli&#x27;s warbler is a disyllabic &quot;hu-it&quot;, differing from that of the eastern Bonelli&#x27;s warbler which is a hard &quot;chup&quot;, reminiscent of a crossbill or a house sparrow.

<doc id="354939" wikidata="Q942925" url="?curid=354939" title="Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop">
<text>Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop is the third studio album by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots, released on March 26, 1996, through Atlantic Records. After a brief hiatus throughout 1995, the band regrouped to record the album together at Westerly Ranch in Santa Ynez, California, where they also lived at the time. Like all of the band&#x27;s albums up to that point, production was handled by Brendan O&#x27;Brien.

The album saw the band deviate from the grunge sound present on their first two records and incorporate a wider variety of different influences, including psychedelic rock and glam rock. Lead vocalist Scott Weiland opted for a higher and raspier tone for much of the album&#x27;s material, as opposed to the deeper vocals present on their previous albums. The album also features a wider array of instrumentation, including organ, vibraphone, and trumpet.

&quot;Tiny Music...&quot; initially received mixed reviews, similar to the band&#x27;s earlier work, but has since received acclaim for radically reinventing the band&#x27;s sound and image. The album debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and all three of its singles—&quot;Big Bang Baby&quot;, &quot;Trippin&#x27; on a Hole in a Paper Heart&quot;, and &quot;Lady Picture Show&quot;—reached the top of the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album has been certified 2× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The band promoted the album with a tour throughout 1996 and 1997, although it had to be cut short due to Weiland&#x27;s ongoing battles with substance abuse.

==Recording==
In early 1995, shortly after the band was forced to scrap two weeks&#x27; worth of recorded material, lead singer Scott Weiland was arrested for heroin and cocaine possession and sentenced to one year&#x27;s probation. In the months following this incident, Weiland formed his own side-band, the Magnificent Bastards, and recorded songs for the &quot;Tank Girl&quot; soundtrack and for a John Lennon tribute album.

During this time the rest of the band decided to put together their own side project, which would later become the band Talk Show with Dave Coutts singing. In the fall of 1995, when Stone Temple Pilots regrouped to record again for &quot;Tiny Music&quot;, Robert and Dean got together to figure out which songs should be &quot;Tiny Music&quot; songs and which songs should be Talk Show songs. Dean would later say &quot;Robert and I had about 30 songs, and we sat in the room one night and basically went down the list and marked next to every song: Scott, Scott, Dave, Scott, Dave, Dave, Scott... It&#x27;s really weird, because in all reality it was like &#x27;Big Bang Baby&#x27; could&#x27;ve been on [the] Talk Show record and &#x27;Everybody Loves My Car&#x27; could&#x27;ve been on &quot;Tiny Music&quot;.&quot; Weiland&#x27;s drug use continued after his sentence, and STP cancelled some of their 1996-1997 tour for &quot;Tiny Music&quot; so that he could go to rehab.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Tiny Music&quot; displays a drastic change in the band&#x27;s sound, featuring music strongly influenced by &#x27;60s rock and bands such as the Beatles. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated in his review of the album that &quot;&quot;Tiny Music&quot; illustrates that the band aren&#x27;t content with resting on their laurels&quot; and &quot;STP have added a new array of sounds that lend depth to their immediately accessible hooks,&quot; naming shoegaze and jangle pop as two examples of genres explored on the album. Erlewine also wrote that the album &quot;showcases the band at their most tuneful and creative.&quot;

==Album artwork==
The album cover was designed by John Eder to resemble a 70s-style LP cover and based on an idea from Weiland, features a woman in a swimsuit standing in a pool with a crocodile in it. The cover model was Maya Siklai (formerly Goodman), a family friend of art director John Heiden. Said John Eder, &quot;The little altar in the background was a last minute addition Scott wanted to put in, and it actually existed in his house, where I went to shoot it.&quot;

==Release and reception==

===Contemporary reviews===

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; favored the album, regarding it as the group&#x27;s best effort to date. They expressed surprise, however, at &quot;the clattering, upbeat character of the music&quot; given Weiland&#x27;s much-publicized run-ins with drugs and the law. The magazine also featured STP on its cover of issue No. 753 in February 1997.

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, however, was less favorable of the album, writing that &quot;none of it... has a distinct personality.&quot;

Band photographer John Eder recounts of the mixed reception, &quot;I remember [Tiny Music] getting totally trashed critically, for example in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, with the critic even singling out and making fun of the bands&#x27; physical appearances – like, their actual body types – in the little snapshot fold-out thing that came in the CD.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===
Following Weiland&#x27;s death, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins posited, &quot;It was STP&#x27;s 3rd album that had got me hooked, a wizardly mix of glam and post-punk, and I confessed to Scott, as well as the band many times, how wrong I&#x27;d been in assessing their native brilliance. And like Bowie can and does, it was Scott&#x27;s phrasing that pushed his music into a unique, and hard to pin down, aesthetic sonicsphere. Lastly, I&#x27;d like to share a thought which though clumsy, I hope would please Scott In Hominum. And that is if you asked me who I truly believed were the great voices of our generation, I&#x27;d say it were he, Layne, and Kurt.&quot;

In 2016, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted that Tiny Music &quot;was an almost shocking leap forward in creative ambition&quot; and that &quot;[STP] got weirder and better than anyone gives them credit for.&quot;

In 2021, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; published a positive review of the 25th anniversary reissue of &quot;Tiny Music&quot;, with the writer Sadie Sartini Garner observing that it is &quot;primarily an album of expansion&quot; and acknowledged their original 1996 review (in which the writer Ryan Schreiber wished that Weiland would &quot;tie [himself] off and fall directly into space forever&quot;) as &quot;genuinely deplorable.&quot; Garner also praised the band&#x27;s 1997 Panama City Beach concert included in the reissue, stating that it &quot;captures Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; power as a live band.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
In the United States, the album debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart on the issue dated April 13, 1996, with 162,500 copies sold. This was a significant decline when compared to the bands previous efforts and can in part be attributed to the decline of grunge in the mid-90&#x27;s. Because of the tour cancellation, &quot;Tiny Music&quot; did not receive as much exposure as initially intended. The album was certified 2× platinum but was not as commercially successful as STP&#x27;s first two albums.

<text>The Eastern Bonelli&#x27;s warbler (Phylloscopus orientalis), sometimes known as Balkan warbler, is a &quot;warbler&quot; in the leaf warbler genus &quot;Phylloscopus&quot;. It was formerly regarded as the eastern subspecies of a wider &quot;Bonelli&#x27;s warbler&quot; species, but as a result of modern taxonomic developments, they are now usually considered to be two species:
* Western Bonelli&#x27;s warbler, &quot;Phylloscopus bonelli&quot;, which breeds in southwest Europe and north Africa
* Eastern Bonelli&#x27;s warbler, &quot;Phylloscopus orientalis&quot;, which breeds in southeast Europe and Asia Minor

The breeding ranges of the two species do not overlap; while their appearance and songs are very similar, the calls are completely different (see below). They also show marked difference in mtDNA sequence.

The species is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a rare vagrant in Northern Europe.

Eastern Bonelli&#x27;s warbler is a small passerine bird, found in forest and woodland. Four to six eggs are laid in a nest on the ground. Like most warblers, eastern Bonelli&#x27;s is insectivorous.

It is a small warbler. The adult has a plain grey-green back, green-toned rump and wings and whitish underparts. The bill is small and pointed and the legs brown. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers.

The eastern Bonelli&#x27;s warbler lacks the browner tinge to the upperparts that the western Bonelli&#x27;s warbler has; it sometimes has a greenish tinge instead. The song is a fast monotone trill, only slightly different from western Bonelli&#x27;s, and also some similarity to the wood warbler. The call of the eastern Bonelli&#x27;s warbler is a hard &quot;chup&quot;, reminiscent of a crossbill or a house sparrow, and completely different from the disyllabic &quot;hu-it&quot; of the western Bonelli&#x27;s warbler.

The genus name &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;skopos&quot;, &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). The specific &quot;orientalis&quot; is Latin for &quot;eastern&quot;. The English name for this bird commemorates the Italian ornithologist Franco Andrea Bonelli.

<text>Chairil Anwar (26 July 1922 – 28 April 1949) was an Indonesian poet and member of the &quot;1945 Generation&quot; of writers. He is estimated to have written 96 works, including 70 individual poems.

Anwar was born and raised in Medan, North Sumatra, before moving to Batavia with his mother in 1940, where he began to enter the local literary circles. After publishing his first poem in 1942, Anwar continued to write. However, his poems were at times censored by the Japanese, who were then occupying Indonesia. Living rebelliously, Anwar wrote extensively, often about death. He died in Jakarta of an unknown illness.

His work dealt with various themes, including death, individualism, and existentialism, and were often multi-interpretable. Drawing influence from foreign poets, Anwar used everyday language and new syntax to write his poetry, which has been noted as aiding the development of the Indonesian language. His poems were often constructed irregularly, but with individual patterns.

== Biography ==
Anwar was born in Medan, North Sumatra on 26 July 1922. As a child, he was hard-headed and unwilling to lose at anything; this was reflective of his parents&#x27; personalities. He was also spoiled by his parents. He attended local schools for native Indonesians, until dropping out at the age of 18 or earlier. Anwar later said that he had known he wanted to be an artist since the age of 15, having already written poetry in the then-dominant style.

After his parents&#x27; divorce, his father continued to financially support him and his mother, who moved to Batavia (Jakarta after Indonesia&#x27;s independence). Although originally intending to continue his schooling, he eventually dropped out again. In Batavia he mixed with many rich Indo children, as well as the local literary scene. Despite him not finishing his schooling, he was capable of actively using English, Dutch, and German.

After Anwar&#x27;s poem &quot;Nisan&quot; (&quot;Grave&quot;; reputedly his first), inspired by his grandmother&#x27;s death, was written in 1942, Anwar gained recognition. However, his poems were at times still rejected. For example, in 1943, when he first approached the magazine &quot;Pandji Pustaka&quot; to submit his poems, most were rejected for being too individualistic and not keeping with the spirit of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, some poems, including &quot;Diponegoro&quot;, were able to pass the censors. During this period he continued associating with other writers, trading ideas and later becoming a leader amongst them. He later established the magazine &quot;Gema Gelanggang&quot;. He wrote his last poem, &quot;Cemara Menderai Sampai Jauh&quot; (&quot;Fir Trees Are Sown Off Into the Distance&quot;), in 1949. In January 1949, his father was one of hundreds of civilians killed by the Dutch in the Rengat massacre.
Anwar died in CBZ Hospital (now R.S. Ciptomangunkusomo), Jakarta, on 28 April 1949; the following day, he was buried at Karet Bivak Cemetery. His cause of death is uncertain, with some suggesting typhus, some syphilis, and some suggesting a combination of the two as well as tuberculosis. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw suggests that Anwar was aware that he would die young, pointing to &quot;Jang Terampas dan Jang Putus&quot; (&quot;The Seized and the Broken&quot;), which has a theme of surrender, and predicts that he will be buried in Karet.

During his lifetime Anwar wrote approximately 94 works, including 71 poems. Of these, Anwar considered only 13 to be truly good poems. His most celebrated work is &quot;Aku&quot; (&quot;Me&quot;). Most of Anwar&#x27;s poems were unpublished at the time of his death, but were later collected in posthumous anthologies. The first published anthology was &quot;Deru Tjampur Debu&quot; (&quot;Roar Mixed with Dust&quot;), which was followed by &quot;Kerikil Tadjam dan Jang Terampas dan Terputus&quot; (&quot;Sharp Pebbles and the Seized and The Broken&quot;). Although several poems in these collections had the same title, they had slight differences. 

== Themes ==
Teeuw notes that it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify a single theme which unites all of Anwar&#x27;s work, as his poems reflect his state of mind at the time of writing. Teeuw writes that the only feature common to all of Anwar&#x27;s work is an intensity and joie de vivre that reflects Anwar&#x27;s radicalism, which permeated all aspects of his life. Individual poems, though at times full of excitement, generally reflect a fear of death or depression, to the point that it is impossible to identify &quot;the true Chairil [Anwar]&quot;.

Aside from that, Anwar&#x27;s works are multi-interpretable, with every reader able to take what they want from his poems; Teeuw notes that the Japanese overlords read &quot;Diponegoro&quot; as a challenge to white colonialists, Indonesia&#x27;s Christians read &quot;Doa&quot; (&quot;Prayer&quot;) and &quot;Isa&quot; (&quot;Jesus&quot;) as proof that Anwar had a positive view of Christianity, and Indonesia&#x27;s Muslims read &quot;Dimesjid&quot; (&quot;At the Mosque&quot;) as proof that Anwar &quot;met with Allah in a mosque and fought with Him&quot;.

Teeuw also notes that Anwar&#x27;s early works heavily show the influence of Hendrik Marsman, while other works harken back to Rainer Maria Rilke, J. Slauerhoff, and Xu Zhimo. Muhammad Balfas notes that Anwar was an &quot;intellectual poet&quot;, with his works being &quot;detached&quot;.

== Style ==
Teeuw writes that Anwar used everyday language in his poetry, which is emphasized by using it in an unusual manner. Anwar also exploited the morphology of Indonesian, using prefixes and suffixes to make the language more dynamic and give a stronger impression. His use of the language, shifting away from the classic Malay influence and showing the influence of Dutch and English loanwords, influenced the later development of the language, showing the weaknesses of contemporary Indonesian.

According to Tinuk Yampolsky of the Lontar Foundation, Anwar&#x27;s western influence is representative of the 1945 Generation. The previous generation had mainly been influenced by traditional verse and nationalism, while the 1945 Generation, including Anwar, dealt with Western-influenced individualism and existentialism.

Balfas notes that Anwar was capable of using foreign &quot;ideas, images, and atmosphere&quot; in his poems, generally from the West but in one poem clearly Japanese. His writing style is generally not traditional. Many poems have a mixture of short, stand-alone lines with long linked lines; however, in each individual poem there is a &quot;definite form&quot; which can be seen. Only three of Anwar&#x27;s poems, &quot;Kepada Peminta-Peminta&quot; (&quot;To the Askers&quot;), &quot;?&quot;, and &quot;Cemara Menderai Sampai Jauh&quot;, follow the traditional four line patter.

== Controversy ==
Teeuw writes that Anwar came under fire after his death for plagiarism. He notes that one instance was due to necessity, as at the time Anwar needed the money to pay for a vaccination. Balfas notes that even though Anwar evidently used other people&#x27;s poems as the basis for some of his, he generally changed them enough and brought new ideas to make them his own. 
== Legacy ==
Teeuw notes that by 1980 more had been written about Anwar than any other Indonesian writer. He also notes that many of them were essays written by young writers, intent on discovering themselves through Anwar&#x27;s works. Teeuw himself describes Anwar as &quot;the perfect poet&quot;.

Leftist critics, including those of Lekra, see Anwar&#x27;s Westernized individualism as being against the spirit of the Indonesian National Revolution, which they define as being for the people.

Anwar&#x27;s poems have been translated into English, French, and Dutch. The anniversary of his death is celebrated as National Literature Day.

== Personal life ==
HB Jassin notes that his first impression of Anwar when the latter submitted his poetry to &quot;Pandji Pustaka&quot; in 1943 was that Anwar &quot;was thin, pale, and seemed unkempt&quot;. Anwar&#x27;s eyes were &quot;red, [and] somewhat wild, but always like he was lost in thought&quot;, while his movements were like &quot;one who simply did not care&quot;.

Yampolsky notes that Anwar provided numerous anecdotes for his friends due to his eccentricities, including kleptomania, plagiarism, womanizing, and being constantly ill. This was worked into the characterization of Anwar in Achdiat Karta Mihardja&#x27;s novel &quot;Atheis&quot;; Anwar&#x27;s friend Nasjah Djamin notes that the characterization captured Anwar&#x27;s nonchalance, impoliteness, and arrogance exactly.

<text>Songshan District is a district of Taipei, Taiwan. The Songshan Airport and the Taipei Arena are located here.

==History==
Songshan was originally named Malysyakkaw, a lowland Ketagalan word meaning &quot;Where the river twists&quot;. Its written form () was abbreviated () in 1815 during Qing rule.

During Japanese rule (1895-1945), the area served as a prime tea-growing area in northern Taiwan. In 1920, the area&#x27;s settlements were established as , Shichisei District, Taihoku Prefecture. The village, named after Matsuyama City in Japan, was incorporated into Taihoku City (modern-day Taipei) in 1938.

At the outset of one-party rule by the Kuomintang (1945-1990), the Mandarin Chinese reading of the kanji characters (i.e. Sung-shan) was adopted as the name of the district, which in 1946 officially comprised 26 municipal villages (). In 1949, the area&#x27;s tea estates gave way to military housing for lower-income Kuomintang refugee families. The bodies of many residents and political victims from Taiwan&#x27;s martial law period are buried in hillside cemeteries that now overlook the Taipei 101 shopping district. By 1980, Songshan was the most populous area of the city.

In 1990, the southern half of Songshan District became Xinyi District while the northern half retained its original name. The boundary of this smaller Songshan District was altered in May 1994 when the course of Keelung River was moved slightly to the south.

<doc id="354951" wikidata="Q328121" url="?curid=354951" title="Greater Tokyo Area">
<text>The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, consisting of the Kantō region of Japan (including Tokyo Metropolis and the prefectures of Chiba, Gunma, Ibaraki, Kanagawa, Saitama, and Tochigi) as well as the prefecture of Yamanashi of the neighboring Chūbu region. In Japanese, it is referred to by various terms, one of the most common being .

As of 2016, the United Nations estimates the total population at 38,140,000. It covers an area of approximately 13,500 km2 (5,200 mi2), giving it a population density of 2,642 people/km2. It is the second-largest single metropolitan area in the world in terms of built-up or urban function landmass at 8,547 km2 (3,300 mi2), behind only the New York City metropolitan area at 11,642 km2 (4,495 mi2). With over US$2 trillion in GDP, Tokyo remains the second-largest metropolitan economy in the world, also behind New York.

==Definition==
There are various definitions of the Greater Tokyo Area, each of which tries to incorporate different aspects. Some definitions are clearly defined by law or government regulation, some are based coarsely on administrative areas, while others are for research purposes such as commuting patterns or distance from Central Tokyo. Each definition has a different population figure, granularity, methodology, and spatial association.

===Various definitions of Tokyo, Greater Tokyo, and Kantō===


===National Capital Region===

The of Japan refers to the Greater Tokyo Area as defined by the of 1956, which defines it as &quot;Tokyo and its surrounding area declared by government ordinance.&quot; The government ordinance defined it as Tokyo and all six prefectures in the Kantō region plus Yamanashi Prefecture. While this includes all of Greater Tokyo, it also includes sparsely populated mountain areas as well as the far-flung Bonin Islands which are administered under Tokyo.

===International comparison===
Using the &quot;One Metropolis Three Prefectures&quot; definition, Tokyo is , a similar size to that of Los Angeles County, and almost two-thirds smaller than the combined statistical area of New York City, at and 21.9 million people. Other metropolitan areas such as Greater Jakarta are considerably more compact as well as more densely populated than Greater Tokyo.

===Metropolitan Area definition ambiguities and issues===
*The is a potentially ambiguous term. Informally, it may mean the One Metropolis, Two Prefectures, or the area without Saitama Prefecture. Formally, it may mean the South Kantō Block, which is not the Greater Tokyo Area, but a proportional representation block of the national election, comprising Kanagawa, Chiba, and Yamanashi Prefectures.
*In informal occasions, the term often means Greater Tokyo Area. Officially, the term refers to a much larger area, namely the whole Kantō region and Yamanashi Prefecture.
*Tokyo as a metropolis includes some 394 km of islands (the Izu and Ogasawara islands), as well as some mountainous areas to the far west (331 km), which are officially part of Greater Tokyo, but are wilderness or rustic areas.

==Cities==
(populations listed for those over 300,000)

===Cities within Tokyo===
Tokyo is legally classified as a , which translates as &quot;metropolis&quot;, and is treated as one of the forty-seven prefectures of Japan. The metropolis is administered by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government as a whole.


====Eastern Tokyo Metropolis====
Central Tokyo, situated in the eastern portion of Tokyo Metropolis, was once incorporated as Tokyo City, which was dismantled during World War II. Its subdivisions have been reclassified as . The twenty three special wards currently have the legal status of cities, with individual mayors and city councils, and they call themselves &quot;cities&quot; in English. However, when listing Japan&#x27;s largest cities, Tokyo&#x27;s twenty three wards are often counted as a single city.

====Western Tokyo Metropolis====
Western Tokyo, known as the Tama Area (&quot;Tama-chiiki&quot; 多摩地域) comprises a number of municipalities, including these suburban cities:

===Cities outside Tokyo===


The core cities of the Greater Tokyo Area outside Tokyo Metropolis are:

*Chiba (population 940,000)
*Kawasaki (population 1.36 million)
*Sagamihara (population 730,000)
*Saitama (population 1.19 million)
*Yokohama (population 3.62 million)

The other cities in Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama Prefectures are:

===Additional cities===
In the major metropolitan area (MMA) definition used by the Japanese Statistics Bureau, the following cities in Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Yamanashi, and Shizuoka Prefectures are included:

====Gunma Prefecture====
*Tatebayashi

====Ibaraki Prefecture====
====Shizuoka Prefecture====
*Atami

====Tochigi Prefecture====
*Oyama

====Yamanashi Prefecture====
*Ōtsuki
*Uenohara

====Border areas====
Tighter definitions for Greater Tokyo do not include adjacent metropolitan areas of Numazu-Mishima (approx. 450,000) to the southwest, Maebashi-Takasaki-Ōta-Ashikaga (approx. 1,500,000 people) on the northwest, and (approx. 1,000,000) to the north. If they are included, Greater Tokyo&#x27;s population would be around 39 million. Takasaki-Maebashi is included as part of the Tokyo-Yokohama area in the definition of urban areas by Demographia.

==Geography==

At the centre of the main urban area (approximately the first from Tokyo Station) are the 23 special wards, formerly treated as a single city but now governed as separate municipalities, and containing many major commercial centres such as Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro and Ginza. Around the 23 special wards are a multitude of suburban cities which merge seamlessly into each other to form a continuous built up area, circumnavigated by the heavily travelled Route 16 which forms a (broken) loop about from central Tokyo. Situated along the loop are the major cities of Yokohama (to the south of Tokyo), Hachiōji (to the west), Ōmiya (now part of Saitama City, to the north), and Chiba (to the east).

Within the Route 16 loop, the coastline of Tokyo Bay is heavily industrialised, with the Keihin Industrial Area stretching from Tokyo down to Yokohama, and the Keiyō Industrial Zone from Tokyo eastwards to Chiba. Along the periphery of the main urban area are numerous new suburban housing developments such as the Tama New Town. The landscape is relatively flat compared to most of Japan, most of it comprising low hills.

Outside the Route 16 loop the landscape becomes more rural. To the southwest is an area known as Shōnan, which contains various cities and towns along the coast of Sagami Bay, and to the west the area is mountainous.

Many rivers run through the area, the major ones being Arakawa and Tama River.

== Demographics ==

==Economy==
Tokyo metropolitan area is the second largest metropolitan economy in the world only behind New York.

===Metropolitan Employment Area===

==Transportation==

===Air===
The Greater Tokyo Area has two major airports, Tokyo International Airport, commonly known as Haneda Airport (once chiefly domestic, now turning international) and Narita International Airport (chiefly international as well). Minor facilities include Chōfu and Ibaraki Airport. Tokyo Heliport serves helicopter traffic, including police, fire, and news. Japan Civil Aviation Bureau handles air traffic in large part but various military facilities handle air traffic in part: Hyakuri Air Base (Japan Air Self-Defense Force), Utsunomiya Air Field (Japan Ground Self-Defense Force), and Yokota Air Base (United States Air Force).

===Rail===
Greater Tokyo has an extensive railway network comprising high-speed rail, commuter rails, subways, monorails, private lines, trams and others. There are around 136 individual rail lines in the Greater Tokyo Area, and between 1,000 and 1,200 railway stations depending on one&#x27;s definition of the area, most designed for heavy use, usually long enough to accommodate 10-car ( long) trains. Stations are designed to accommodate hundreds of thousands of passengers at any given time, with miles of connecting tunnels linking vast department stores and corporate offices. Tokyo Station has underground connections that stretch well over , and Shinjuku Station has well over 200 exits. Greater Tokyo&#x27;s Railway Network is easily considered the world&#x27;s largest in terms of both daily passenger throughput with a daily trips of over 40 million (20 million different passengers) as well as physical extent with approximately of track. Shinjuku station is used by an average of 3.34 million people per day, making it the world&#x27;s busiest train station. Some 57 percent of all Greater Tokyo residents used rail as their primary means of transport in 2001.

JR East and many other carriers crisscross the region with a network of rail lines. The most important carriers include Keihin Kyūkō Electric Railway (&quot;Keikyū&quot;), Keisei Electric Railway, Keiō Electric Railway, Odakyū Electric Railway, Seibu Railway, Tōbu Railway, and Tōkyū Corporation. In addition to Tokyo&#x27;s two subway systems — Tokyo Metro and Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation (&quot;Toei&quot; and &quot;Toden&quot; lines), Yokohama also has two subway lines.

The Tokyo Monorail provides an important shuttle service between Haneda Airport and Hamamatsucho station on the Yamanote line.

===Others===
The Shuto Expressway system connects to other national expressways in the capital region.

Tokyo and Yokohama are major commercial seaports, and both the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and United States Navy maintain naval bases at Yokosuka.

<text>Hōne Wiremu Heke Pōkai ( 1807/1808 – 7 August 1850), born Heke Pōkai and later often referred to as Hōne Heke, was a highly influential Māori rangatira (chief) of the Ngāpuhi iwi (tribe) and a war leader in northern New Zealand; he was affiliated with the Ngati Rahiri, Ngai Tawake, Ngati Tautahi, Te Matarahurahu and Te Uri-o-Hua hapū (subtribes) of Ngāpuhi. Hōne Heke fought with Hongi Hika, an earlier war leader of the Ngāpuhi, in the Musket Wars. Hōne Heke is considered the principal instigator of the Flagstaff War in 1845–46.

==Biography==
Heke was born at Pakaraka, south of Kerikeri in the Bay of Islands, in 1807 or 1808. His father was Tupanapana and his mother Te Kona. He was named Heke Pōkai, after his mother&#x27;s brother Pokaia. He grew up in the Kaikohe area. As a youth, he attended the Church Missionary Society school at Kerikeri in 1824 and 1825 and came under the influence of the missionary Henry Williams. Subsequently, he, his first wife Ono (daughter of Te Pahi) and their two infant children were converted to Christianity. He and his wife were baptised on 9 August 1835, Heke Pōkai taking the Christian names Hoani or Hōne and Wiremu, and Ono taking the name Riria (Lydia). Hōne Heke became a lay preacher in the Anglican church. Riria and the children died soon after and Heke married Hariata (Harriet) Rongo, daughter of Hongi Hika, in the Kerikeri chapel on 30 March 1837.

Despite becoming a Christian, it was as a warrior and as a leader of a Māori rebellion that Hōne Heke is best known. He took part in the fighting on the beach at Kororareka in 1830 that is known as the Girls&#x27; War. After that fighting he participated in Tītore&#x27;s expeditions to Tauranga in 1832 &amp; 1833, and he fought with Tītore against Whiria (Pōmare II) in 1837.

==Treaty of Waitangi==
Conflicting reports survive as to when Heke signed the Treaty of Waitangi. He may have signed with the other chiefs on 6 February 1840, but in any event, he soon found the agreement not to his liking. Among other things, Heke objected to the relocation of the capital to Auckland; moreover the Governor-in-Council imposed a customs tariff on staple articles of trade that resulted in a dramatic fall in the number of whaling ships that visited Kororāreka (over 20 whaling ships could anchor in the bay at any time); a reduction in the number of visiting ships caused a serious loss of revenue to Ngāpuhi. Heke and his cousin Tītore also collected and divided a levy of £5 on each ship entering the bay. Pōmare II also felt aggrieved that he could no longer collect payment from American whaling and sealing ships that called at Otuihu across from Opua.

The British representative became concerned that Heke and the Ngāpuhi chief Pōmare II flew the American Ensign. Heke and Pomare II had listened to Captain William Mayhew, the Acting-Consul for the United States since 1840, and to other Americans talking about the successful revolt of the American colonies against England over the issue of taxation. Heke obtained an American ensign from Henry Green Smith, a storekeeper at Wahapu who had succeeded Mayhew as Acting-Consul. After the flagstaff was cut down for a second time the Stars and Stripes flew from the carved sternpost of Heke&#x27;s war-canoe. Letters from William Williams record talks he had with Heke, and refer to American traders attempting to undermine the British both before and especially after the signing of the treaty. William Mayhew left New Zealand and Green Smith and Charles Berry Waetford then acted as unofficial American Consuls. They continued in anti-British activities, selling muskets and powder to the disaffected Māori. Waetford was later convicted and imprisoned for gunrunning, but Green Smith successfully escaped New Zealand before the Crown could arrest him.

Bishop Pompallier, who led the Roman Catholic missionaries, had advised several of the leading Catholic chiefs (such as Rewa and Te Kemara) to be very wary in signing the treaty, so it is not surprising that they had spoken out against the treaty. William Colenso, the CMS missionary printer, in his record of the events of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi commented that &quot;After some little time Te Kemara came towards the table and affixed his sign to the parchment, stating that the Roman Catholic bishop (who had left the meeting before any of the chiefs had signed) had told him not to 
&quot;write on the paper, for if he did he would be made a slave.&quot;

Following the signing of the treaty the British regarded the authority of the chiefs as subservient to that of the Crown; an interpretation which is not actually written in the Treaty of Waitangi and has not born out in the courts since, as the governor asserted the rule of law, the presence of government officials and troops had resulted in an end to the free-wheeling lawless situation that had prevailed in the North since the 1820s.

==Events leading to the outbreak of the Flagstaff War==
Other matters also caused dissatisfaction among the Ngāpuhi. One item involved the shifting of the capital of the new colony from Okiato to Auckland in 1841. Auckland had experienced a significant economic boom with the discovery of copper at Kawau island. In 1844/45 the copper was worth 7000 pounds, about a third of Auckland&#x27;s total exports for that period of time. This resulted in a loss of revenue for the people of the Bay of Islands. Furthermore, the imposition of government customs duties, the temporary ban on the felling of kauri trees, and the government control over the sale of land all contributed to an economic depression for the northern Māori.

The trial and execution of Wiremu Kīngi Maketū in 1842 for murder was, in the opinion of Archdeacon Henry Williams, the beginning of Heke&#x27;s antagonism to the colonial administration, as Heke began gathering support among the Ngāpuhi for a rebellion against the colonial administration. However it was not until 1844 that Heke sought the support of Te Ruki Kawiti and other leaders of the Ngāpuhi iwi by the conveying of ‘te ngākau’, the custom observed by those who sought help to settle a tribal grievance.

On 8 July 1844 the flagstaff on Maiki Hill at the north end of Kororareka was cut down for the first time by Heke&#x27;s ally Te Haratua, the chief of Pakaraka. Heke himself had set out to cut down the flagstaff, but had been persuaded by Archdeacon William Williams not to do so. As a signal of his unhappiness with the British, and encouraged by the American traders, in the space of six months Hōne Heke returned to chop the flagpole down three times. Heke had been strongly influenced by stories of the American War of Independence.

==Battle of Kororāreka==
The uprising began when the flagpole was cut down for the fourth time at dawn on Tuesday 11 March 1845. A force of about 600 Māori armed with muskets, double-barrelled guns and tomahawks attacked Kororareka. Heke&#x27;s warriors attacked the guard post, killing all the defenders, and Heke cut down the flagstaff. At the same time, possibly as a diversion, Te Ruki Kawiti and his men attacked the town of Kororareka. The survivors from the 250 soldiers and settlers abandoned the town as bombarded Heke&#x27;s warriors with cannon. Heke&#x27;s men then raided the town taking anything useful they could find. Heke&#x27;s order that the southern part of Korororeka remain untouched resulted in the Anglican and Catholic churches being undamaged.

Many Māori under the mana of the leading northern rangitira, Tāmati Wāka Nene, stayed loyal to the British government. They took an active part in the fight against Heke and tried to maintain a dialogue with the rebels in an effort to bring peace.

==Heke and Nene skirmishes ==
After the attack on Kororareka, Heke and Kawiti and the warriors travelled inland to Lake Ōmāpere near to Kaikohe some , or two days travel, from the Bay of Islands. Nene built a pā close to Lake Ōmāpere. Heke&#x27;s pā named Puketutu, was away, while it is sometimes named as &quot;Te Mawhe&quot; however the hill of that name is some distance to the north-east. In April 1845, during the time that the colonial forces were gathering in the Bay of Islands, the warriors of Heke and Nene fought many skirmishes on the small hill named Taumata-Karamu that was between the two pās, and on open country between Okaihau and Te Ahuahu. Heke&#x27;s force numbered about three hundred men; Kawiti joined Heke towards the end of April with another hundred and fifty warriors. Opposing Heke and Kawiti were about four hundred warriors that supported Tamati Waka Nene including the chiefs, Makoare Te Taonui and his son Aperahama Taonui, Mohi Tawhai, Arama Karaka Pi and Nōpera Panakareao.

==Attack on Heke&#x27;s Pā at Puketutu==
On 8 May 1845 Heke&#x27;s Pā at Puketutu (Te Mawhe) was attacked by troops from the 58th, 96th and 99th Regiments with marines and a Congreve rocket unit, under the command of Lt Col William Hulme.

The British troops had no heavy guns but they had brought with them a dozen Congreve rockets. The Māori had never seen rockets used and were anticipating a formidable display. The first two missed their target completely; the third hit the palisade, duly exploded and was seen to have done no damage. This display gave considerable encouragement to the Māori. Soon all the rockets had been expended leaving the palisade intact.

The storming parties began to advance, first crossing a narrow gulley between the lake and the pā. Kawiti and his warriors arrived at the battle and engaged with the Colonial forces in the scrub and gullies around the pā. There followed a savage and confused battle. Eventually the discipline and cohesiveness of the British troops began to prevail and the Māori were driven back inside the pā. But they were by no means beaten, far from it, as without artillery the British had no way to overcome the defences of the pā. Hulme decided to disengage and retreat back to the Bay of Islands.

In the battle, the British suffered 14 killed and 38 wounded. The Māori losses were 47 killed and about 80 wounded.

==Battle of Te Ahuahu==

After the successful defence of Puketutu (Te Mawhe) Pā on the shores of Lake Omapere, the pā was abandoned, in accordance with Māori custom, as blood had been spilt there, so that the place became tapu. Hōne Heke returned to the pā he had built at Te Ahuahu. Tāmati Wāka Nene built a pā at Okaihau in the days that followed that battle at Puketutu (Te Mawhe) Pā. The warriors of Heke Tāmati Wāka Nene fought several minor skirmishes with the warriors of Heke and Kawiti.

The hostilities disrupted the food production and in order to obtain provisions for his warriors, in early June 1845 Heke went to Kaikohe and on to Pakaraka to gather food supplies. During his absence one of Tāmati Wāka Nene&#x27;s allies, the Hokianga chief, Makoare Te Taonui, attacked and captured Te Ahuahu. This was a tremendous blow to Heke&#x27;s mana or prestige, obviously it had to be recaptured as soon as possible.

Until the 1980s, histories of the Northern War tend to ignore the poorly documented Battle of Te Ahuahu yet it was the most significant fight of the entire war as it is the only engagement that can be described as a clear victory – not for the British forces – but for Tāmati Wāka Nene and his warriors. However, there are no detailed accounts of the action. It was fought entirely between the Māori warriors on 12 June 1845 near by Te Ahuahu at Pukenui – Hōne Heke and his warriors against Tāmati Wāka Nene and his warriors. As there was no official British involvement in the action there is little mention of the event in contemporary British accounts. Hugh Carleton (1874) mentions

Richard Davis also recorded that

At the Battle of Te Ahuahu on 12 June 1845 Nene&#x27;s warriors carried the day. Heke lost at least 30 warriors and was driven from Te Ahuahu leaving Tāmati Wāka Nene in control of Heke&#x27;s pā. Haratua recovered from his wound. Heke was severely wounded and did not rejoin the conflict until some months later, at the closing phase of the Battle of Ruapekapeka. After the battle of Te Ahuahu Heke went to Kaikohe to recover from his wounds. He was visited by Henry Williams and Robert Burrows, who hoped to persuade Heke to end the fighting. In a letter to Lieutenant Colonel Despard the battle was described by Tāmati Wāka Nene as a &quot;most complete victory over Heke&quot;.

==Battle of Ruapekapeka Pā==
The siege of Ruapekapeka began on 27 December 1845 and continued until 11 January 1846. This pā had been constructed by Te Ruki Kawiti to apply, and improve on, the defensive design used at Ohaeawai Pā; the external palisades at Ruapekapeka Pā provided a defence against cannon and musket fire and a barrier to attempted assaults on the pā.

Over two weeks, the British bombarded the pā with cannon fire until the external palisades were breached on 10 January 1846. On Sunday, 11 January William Walker Turau, the brother of Eruera Maihi Patuone, discovered that the pā appeared to have been abandoned; although Te Ruki Kawiti and a few of his followers remained behind, and appeared to have been caught unaware by the British assault. An assaulting force drove Kawiti and his warriors out of the pā. Fighting took place behind the pā and most casualties occurred in this phase of the battle.

It was later suggested that most of the Māori had been at church as many of them were devout Christians. Knowing that their enemy, the British, were also Christians they had not expected an attack on a Sunday. The Revd. Richard Davis noted in his diary of 14 January 1846

However, later commentators cast doubt as to this explanation of the events of Sunday, 11 January as fighting continued on Sunday at the Battle of Ohaeawai. Another explanation provided by later commentators is that Heke deliberately abandoned the pā to lay a trap in the surrounding bush as this would provide cover and give Heke a considerable advantage. If this is the correct explanation, then the Heke&#x27;s ambush was only partially successful, as Kawiti&#x27;s men, fearing their chief had fallen, returned towards the pā and the British forces engaged in battle with the Māori rebels immediately behind the pā.

In any event after four hours of battle, the Māori rebels withdrew. The British forces, left in occupation of the pā, proclaimed a victory.

==End of the Flagstaff War==
Shortly after Ruapekapeka, Heke and Kawiti met their principal Māori opponent, the loyalist chief, Tāmati Wāka Nene, and agreed upon peace. Nene went to Auckland to tell the governor that peace had been won; with Nene insisting that the British accept the terms of Kawiti and Heke that they were to be unconditionally pardoned for their rebellion.

The governor, George Grey presented the end of the rebellion as a British victory. Grey had no respect for the political stance that Heke assumed, saying &quot;I cannot discover that the rebels have a single grievance to complain of which would in any degree extenuate their present conduct and. . . I believe that it arises from an irrational contempt of the powers of Great Britain.&quot; Not withstanding this opinion, Heke and George Grey were reconciled at a meeting in May 1848 at Te Waimate mission.

==Legacy of Hōne Heke==
The ingenious design of the Ohaeawai Pā and the Ruapekapeka Pā became known to other Māori tribes. These designs were the basis of what is now called the &quot;gunfighter pā&quot; that were built during the later New Zealand Wars. The capture of Ruapekapeka Pā can be considered a British tactical victory, but it was purpose-built as a target for the British, and its loss was not damaging; Heke and Kawiti managed to escape with their forces intact.
It is clear that Kawiti and Heke made considerable gains from the war, despite the British victory at Ruapekapeka. After the war&#x27;s conclusion, Heke enjoyed a considerable surge in prestige and authority. The missionary Richard Davis, writing on 28 August 1846, stated that &quot;amongst his countrymen, as a patriot, he has raised himself to the very pinnacle of honour, and is much respected wherever he goes&quot;.

Following the conflict Hōne Heke retired to Kaikohe. There, two years later, he died of tuberculosis on 7 August 1850. The Revd. Richard Davis performed a Christian ceremony and then his second wife Hariata Rongo (a daughter of Hongi Hika) and other followers who had been his bodyguards for many years, took his body to a cave near Pakaraka, called Umakitera. In April 2011 it was announced by David Rankin, (of Te Matarahurahu hapū (subtribe) of the Ngāpuhi and the Hōne Heke Foundation), that the bones of Hōne Heke would be moved and buried at a public cemetery, as the land near the cave was being developed, and in May 2011 he supervised the move; although some Ngāpuhi questioned his right to do so.

A relief sculpture of Heke can be found on the Auckland High Court building walls, and which was sculpted by Anton Teutenberg and unveiled in 1866.

<doc id="354963" wikidata="Q2603434" url="?curid=354963" title="No. 4 (album)">
<text>No. 4 (officially stylized as № 4) is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots, released on October 26, 1999, by Atlantic Records. The album was a return to the band&#x27;s earlier hard rock roots, while also blending elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, and alternative rock. Despite the lack of promotion due to singer Scott Weiland&#x27;s one-year jail sentence shortly before the album&#x27;s release, &quot;No. 4&quot; was certified Platinum by the RIAA on August 7, 2000, and by the CRIA in August 2001. The song &quot;Down&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the Grammy Awards. The album also produced one of STP&#x27;s biggest hits, &quot;Sour Girl&quot;, which charted at No. 78 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, their only song to appear on that chart. The CD was originally released as a digipak, then later changed to a standard jewel case.

==Musical style==
&quot;No. 4&quot; displays the band returning to the more hard rock-oriented sound of their first two albums. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic cited the album as STP&#x27;s &quot;hardest effort&quot; since &quot;Core&quot;, remarking that &quot;it&#x27;s as if STP decided to compete directly with the new generation of alt-metal bands who prize aggression over hooks or riffs.&quot; Erlewine also commented that &quot;No. 4&quot; &quot;consolidates all [of STP&#x27;s] strengths.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;AllMusic&quot; critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album four out of five stars, praising the opening tracks &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;Heaven &amp; Hot Rods&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Rob Brunner graded it &quot;C&quot;, calling the album &quot;generic and phoned in&quot; and mostly &quot;unexciting and obvious&quot;. Brunner deemed the track &quot;Down&quot; as &quot;dour&quot;, &quot;No Way Out&quot; as &quot;dated&quot;, and &quot;Atlanta&quot; as &quot;pretentious&quot;. Brunner further deemed the tracks &quot;Sex &amp; Violence&quot; and &quot;Pruno&quot; as &quot;hardly original&quot; and having resemblances to David Bowie but also as &quot;well-crafted&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Lorraine Ali rated it three out of five, calling the songs &quot;strong pop-rock pieces but without the self-consciousness of previous efforts&quot;. &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; critic M. Tye Comer called the album &quot;powerful and cohesive&quot;, recommending readers to listen the tracks &quot;Heaven &amp; Hot Rods&quot;, &quot;Church on Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Sour Girl&quot;, and &quot;No Way Out&quot;. Critics noted similarities between &quot;Atlanta&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; from the 1959 musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

==Album cover==
The cover art for &quot;No. 4&quot; generated some brief controversy because it strongly resembled the cover of the debut EP from Washington, D.C.–based band Power Lloyd. The Power Lloyd CD &quot;Election Day&quot; had been released in 1998, and the cover was a white five-point star on a black field under the band&#x27;s name; STP&#x27;s &quot;No. 4&quot; also featured a white five-point star on a black field under the band&#x27;s name. Power Lloyd co-founder Gene Diotalevi explained that after their band had given a song to MTV to be used on the soundtrack of &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;, someone at MTV with an advance copy of &quot;No. 4&quot; noticed that the covers were nearly identical, and alerted the band. Diotalevi stated that no one from STP&#x27;s camp would return their calls or letters, until his band mailed a cease-and-desist letter to STP&#x27;s record company. STP&#x27;s legal team then &quot;made an offer to settle that was unacceptable to us&quot;, according to Power Lloyd&#x27;s lawyer Will Shill.

<doc id="354964" wikidata="Q120446" url="?curid=354964" title="Viviparity">
<text>In animals, viviparity is development of the embryo inside the body of the mother, with the maternal circulation providing for the metabolic needs of the embryo&#x27;s development, until the mother gives birth to a fully or partially developed juvenile that is at least metabolically independent. This is opposed to oviparity, where the embryos develop independently outside the mother in eggs until they are developed enough to break out as hatchlings; and ovoviviparity, where the embryos are developed in eggs that remain carried inside the mother&#x27;s body until the hatchlings emerge from the mother as juveniles, similar to a live birth.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;viviparity&quot; and its adjective form &quot;viviparous&quot; both derive from the Latin &quot;vivus&quot;, meaning &quot;living&quot;; and &quot;pario&quot;, meaning &quot;give birth to&quot;.

== Reproductive mode ==

Five modes of reproduction have been differentiated in animals based on relations between zygote and parents. The five include two nonviviparous modes: ovuliparity, with external fertilisation, and oviparity, with internal fertilisation. In the latter, the female lays zygotes as eggs with a large yolk; this occurs in all birds, most reptiles, and some fishes. These modes are distinguished from viviparity, which covers all the modes that result in live birth:

*Histotrophic viviparity: the zygotes develop in the female&#x27;s oviducts, but find their nutrients by oophagy or adelphophagy (intra-uterine cannibalism of eggs or sibling embryos in some sharks or in the black salamander &quot;Salamandra atra&quot;).
*Hemotrophic viviparity: nutrients are provided by the female, often through some form of placenta. In the frog &quot;Gastrotheca ovifera&quot;, embryos are fed by the mother through specialized gills. The skink &quot;Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii &quot;and most mammals exhibit a hemotrophic viviparity.
*Placental viviparity is arguably the most highly developed form of viviparity. Placental mammals, including humans, are the best-known example, but adaptations in some other animals also have incorporated this principle or close analogies. Other examples include some species of scorpions and cockroaches, certain genera of sharks and snakes, and some species of velvet worms.
*Ovoviviparity, a less developed form of viviparity, occurs in most vipers, and in most live-bearing bony fishes (Poeciliidae). However, the term is poorly and inconsistently defined, and may be obsolete. This term has been redefined and more commonly referred to as oviparous egg retention or prolonged egg retention.

At least some transport of nutrients from mother to embryo appears to be common to all viviparous species, but those with fully developed placentas such as found in the Theria, some skinks, and some fish can rely on the placenta for transfer of all necessary nutrients to the offspring and for removal of all the metabolic wastes as well once it has been fully established during the early phases of a pregnancy. In such species, there is direct, intimate contact between maternal and embryonic tissue, though there also is a placental barrier to control or prevent uncontrolled exchange and the transfer of pathogens.

In at least one species of skink in the large genus &quot;Trachylepis&quot;, placental transport accounts for nearly all of the provisioning of nutrients to the embryos before birth. In the uterus, the eggs are very small, about 1 mm in diameter, with very little yolk and very thin shells. The shell membrane is vestigial and transient; its disintegration permits the absorption of nutrients from uterine secretions. The embryo then produces invasive chorionic tissues that grow between the cells of the uterine lining till they can absorb nutrients from maternal blood vessels. As it penetrates the lining, the embryonic tissue grows aggressively till it forms sheets of tissue beneath the uterine epithelium. They eventually strip it away and replace it, making direct contact with maternal capillaries. In several respects, the phenomenon is of considerable importance in theoretical zoology. Blackburn &amp; Flemming (2011) remark that such an endotheliochorial placenta is fundamentally different from that of any known viviparous reptile.

There is no relationship between sex-determining mechanisms and whether a species bears live young or lays eggs. Temperature-dependent sex determination, which cannot function in an aquatic environment, is seen only in terrestrial viviparous reptiles. Therefore, marine viviparous species, including sea snakes and, it now appears, the mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and plesiosaurs of the Cretaceous, use genotypic sex determination (sex chromosomes), much as birds and mammals do. Genotypic sex determination is also found in most reptiles, including many viviparous ones (such as &quot;Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii&quot;), whilst temperature dependent sex determination is found in some viviparous species, such as the montane water skink (&quot;Eulamprus tympanum&quot;).

== Evolution ==
In general, viviparity and matrotrophy are believed to have evolved from an ancestral condition of oviparity and lecithotrophy (nutrients supplied through the yolk). One traditional hypothesis concerning the sequence of evolutionary steps leading to viviparity is a linear model. According to such a model, provided that fertilization was internal, the egg might have been retained for progressively longer periods in the reproductive tract of the mother. Through continued generations of egg retention, viviparous lecithotrophy may have gradually developed; in other words the entire development of the embryo, though still with nutrients provided by the yolk, occurred inside the mother&#x27;s reproductive tract, after which she would give birth to the young as they hatched. The next evolutionary development would be incipient matrotrophy, in which yolk supplies are gradually reduced and are supplemented with nutrients from the mother&#x27;s reproductive tract.

In many ways, depending on the ecology and life strategy of the species, viviparity may be more strenuous and more physically and energetically taxing on the mother than oviparity. However, its numerous evolutionary origins imply that in some scenarios there must be worthwhile benefits to viviparous modes of reproduction; selective pressures have led to its convergent evolution more than 150 times among the vertebrates alone.

There is no one mode of reproduction that is universally superior in selective terms, but in many circumstances viviparity of various forms offers good protection from parasites and predators and permits flexibility in dealing with problems of reliability and economy in adverse circumstances. Variations on the theme in biology are enormous, ranging from trophic eggs to resorption of partly developed embryos in hard times or when they are too numerous for the mother to bring to term, but among the most profoundly advantageous features of viviparity are various forms of physiological support and protection of the embryo, such as thermoregulation and osmoregulation. Since the developing offspring remains within the mother&#x27;s body, she becomes, in essence, a walking incubator, protecting the developing young from excessive heat, cold, drought, or flood. This offers powerful options for dealing with excessive changes in climate or when migration events expose populations to unfavourable temperatures or humidities. In squamate reptiles in particular, there is a correlation between high altitudes or latitudes, colder climates and the frequency of viviparity. The idea that the tendency to favour egg-retention selectively under cooler conditions arises from the thermoregulatory benefits, and that it consequently promotes the evolution of viviparity as an adaptation, is known as &quot;the cold climate hypothesis&quot;.

== Reversion of viviparity ==
Through ancestral state reconstruction, scientists have shown that the evolution of viviparity to oviparity may have occurred a maximum of eight times in the genus &quot;Gerrhonotus&quot; of anguid lizards. Advanced ancestral state reconstruction was used to more accurately prove that the reverse evolution of viviparity to oviparity is true. In the analysis, the authors use a maximum likelihood tree to reveal that parity mode is a labile trait in the Squamata order. They also further show through analysis that viviparity is also strongly associated with cooler climates which suggests the previously stated &quot;cold-climate hypothesis&quot; is true.

However, others directly refute this notion that parity is a labile trait. In their critique, they show that ancestral state reconstruction analyses are reliant on the underlying phylogenetic information provided. The use of a maximum likelihood tree which is vulnerable to phylogenetic error may cause an artificial inflation of the number of viviparity to oviparity occurrences. Additionally, they state that the previous study does not take into account the morphological and behavioral modifications that would have to occur for reversion to occur. Some of these modifications would be the redevelopment of uterine glands to synthesize and secrete shell fibers, the restoration of the careful timing of oviposition due to eggshell thickness, etc. The degradation and loss of function of oviparous genes during viviparous evolution suggests that these genes would have to re-evolve in order for the reversion of this evolution to occur. Since this re-evolution is near impossible due to the complexity of oviparous reproductive mode, the simple labile characteristic of parity cannot be sufficiently supported.

<text>Ovoviviparity, ovovivipary, ovivipary, or aplacental viviparity is a term used as a &quot;bridging&quot; form of reproduction between egg-laying oviparous and live-bearing viviparous reproduction. Ovoviviparous animals possess embryos that develop inside eggs that remain in the mother&#x27;s body until they are ready to hatch.

The young of some ovoviviparous amphibians, such as &quot;Limnonectes larvaepartus&quot;, are born as larvae, and undergo further metamorphosis outside the body of the mother. Members of genera &quot;Nectophrynoides&quot; and &quot;Eleutherodactylus&quot; bear froglets, not only the hatching, but all the most conspicuous metamorphosis, being completed inside the body of the mother before birth.

Among insects that depend on opportunistic exploitation of transient food sources, such as many Sarcophagidae and other carrion flies, and species such as many Calliphoridae, that rely on fresh dung, and parasitoids such as tachinid flies that depend on entering the host as soon as possible, the embryos commonly develop to the first larval instar inside the mother&#x27;s reproductive tract, and they hatch just before being laid or almost immediately afterwards.

==Ovoviviparity==
Ovoviviparous animals are those animals that are similar to viviparous species in which there is internal fertilization and the young are born alive, but differ in that there is no placental connection and the unborn young are nourished by egg; the mother&#x27;s body does provide gas exchange.

In some species, the internally developing embryos rely solely on yolk. This is known as &quot;yolk-sac viviparity&quot; and is regarded as a type of lecithotrophy (no maternal provisioning). Other species exhibit matrotrophy, in which the embryo exhausts its yolk supply early in gestation and the mother provides additional nutrition. This additional provisioning may be in the form of unfertilized eggs (intrauterine oophagy), uterine secretions (histotrophy) or it may be delivered through a placenta. The first two of these modes were categorized under histotroph viviparity, or aplacental viviparity.

==Amphibians==
The young of ovoviviparous amphibians are sometimes born as larvae, and undergo metamorphosis outside the body of the mother. Modes of reproduction include based on relations between zygote and parents:
* Ovuliparity: external fertilisation, as in arthropods, many bony fishes, and most amphibians
* Oviparity: internal fertilisation, where the female lays zygotes as eggs with important vitellus (typically birds)
* Ovoviviparity can be thought of as a form of oviparity where the zygotes are retained in the female&#x27;s body or in the male&#x27;s body, but there are no trophic interactions between zygote and parents. This is found in &quot;Anguis fragilis&quot;. In seahorses, zygotes remain in the male&#x27;s ventral &quot;marsupium&quot;. In the frog &quot;Rhinoderma darwinii&quot;, the zygotes develop in the vocal sac. In the frog &quot;Rheobatrachus&quot;, zygotes develop in the stomach.

==Ovolarviparity==
Some insects, notably tachinid flies, are ovolarviparous, which means that the embryos develop into the first larval stage (instar) within the eggs while still in the female&#x27;s oviduct. As a result, the larvae hatch more rapidly, sometimes immediately after egg deposition, and can begin feeding right away. A similar phenomenon is larviparity, in which larvae hatch &quot;before&quot; the female delivers them, although this may be mistakenly identified in species with very thin and transparent egg membranes.

==Criticisms and disuse==
A lack of a rigidly defined term resulted in widespread misuse of the term ovoviviparity in the biological literature. Ovoviviparity has been used to describe delayed forms of egg-laying reproduction as well as live-bearing species that provide maternal nutrients but do not use a placenta. This widespread misuse of the term has led to confusion over what earlier authors meant when using the name. Modern practice has seen the disuse of ovoviviparity in favour of the more specific definitions of lecithotrophic and matrotrophic oviparity and viviparity.
