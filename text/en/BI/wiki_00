<text>Emperor Xuan of Han (; 91 BC – 10 January 48 BC), born Liu Bingyi (劉病已), was the tenth emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 74 to 48 BC, and was one of the only four Western Han emperors to receive a temple name (along with Emperor Gaozu, Emperor Wen and Emperor Wu). During his reign, the Han dynasty prospered economically and militarily became a regional superpower, and was considered by many to be the peak period of the entire Han history. His time of rule, along with his predecessor Emperor Zhao&#x27;s are known by historians as Zhaoxuan Restoration (昭宣中興). He was succeeded by his son Emperor Yuan after his death in 48 BC.

Emperor Xuan&#x27;s life story was a riches-to-rags-to-riches story. He was born a prince as a great-grandson of Emperor Wu. His grandfather Liu Ju, was a son of Emperor Wu and Empress Wei and the crown prince of the Han Empire, who in 91 BC was framed for witchcraft practice against Emperor Wu and committed suicide after being forced into a failed uprising. His father Liu Jin () also died in that turmoil, along with the rest of his family.

Emperor Xuan was only a months-old infant at the time and only survived due to the protection of the sympathetic prison warden Bing Ji, and lived his youth as a commoner after being released by a nationwide amnesty from Emperor Wu in 87 BC. After Liu He&#x27;s short 27-day reign in 74 BC, the 17-year-old Liu Bingyi was selected by Huo Guang (the half-brother of Liu Bingyi&#x27;s great-cousin Huo Qubing) for the throne, inheriting the crown that ironically would have been his anyway if his grandfather&#x27;s rebellion in 91 BC hadn&#x27;t happened.

Emperor Xuan has been considered a hardworking and brilliant ruler by historians. Because he grew up among commoners, he thoroughly understood the suffering of the grassroot population, and lowered taxes, liberalized the government and employed capable ministers to the government. He was said by Liu Xiang to have been fond of reading the works of Shen Buhai, using &quot;Xing-Ming&quot; to control his subordinates and devoting much time to legal cases.

Emperor Xuan was open to suggestions, was a good judge of character, and consolidated his power by eliminating corrupt officials, including the Huo family who had exerted considerable power since the death of Emperor Wu, after Huo Guang&#x27;s death. However, his execution of the entire Huo clan later drew heavy criticism from historians (e.g. Sima Guang in his &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;) for being &quot;ungrateful&quot; to the late Huo Guang.

== Family background and early life ==
=== Parentage, disaster, and a barely spared young life ===
Liu Bingyi was born in 91 BC to Liu Jin, the son of then-Crown Prince Liu Ju, and his wife Consort Wang. As the grandson of the Crown Prince, Bingyi likely was born in Prince Ju&#x27;s palace.

That same year, however, disaster would strike. With conspirators accusing him of using witchcraft against his father Emperor Wu, Prince Ju was forced into a rebellion, which Prince Ju was defeated. Prince Ju committed suicide, and Bingyi&#x27;s two uncles died with him, although it was not clear whether they also committed suicide or were killed by soldiers. Bingyi&#x27;s great-grandmother Empress Wei also committed suicide, and his grandmother (Prince Ju&#x27;s concubine) Consort Shi and his parents died in the incident as well in the capital Chang&#x27;an. It is not completely clear whether they took their own lives or were executed, but the latter seems likely.

For reasons not completely clear, baby Bingyi was spared, but was imprisoned in a prison overseen by the Ministry of Vassal Affairs. He was put into the custody of the warden Bing Ji (). Bing knew that Prince Ju was actually innocent of witchcraft and took pity on the child, and selected two kind female prisoners, Hu Zu () and Guo Zhengqing () to serve as his wet nurses and caretakers. Bing Ji visited them each day to see how the child was doing.

=== Childhood ===
Near the end of Emperor Wu&#x27;s reign, there was an incident whereby magicians claimed that an aura of an emperor was appearing from Chang&#x27;an&#x27;s prisons. Emperor Wu fearing that whoever the aura came from would later steal the throne from the imperial clan ordered that all prisoners, regardless of whether they had been convicted or not and regardless of the severity of the charges, were to be executed. When the eunuch delivering the edict arrived at the Vassal Affairs prison that Bing oversaw, Bing refused to accept the edict, stating that no one who had not been convicted of a capital crime should be executed, and particularly not the emperor&#x27;s own great-grandson. The eunuch filed charges against Bing for refusing to abide by the edict—a capital offense—but by that time Emperor Wu had realized his error, and declared a general pardon. The prisoners in all other prisons were dead, but the prisoners at Bing&#x27;s prison survived.

However, this incident made Bing feel that it was inappropriate for the young Bingyi to remain at the prison, and so he ordered one of his lieutenants to transfer Bingyi and Hu (Guo might have died by this point) to the city government of Chang&#x27;an. The city government refused to accept responsibility, and so Bing had to let them remain in prison. After Hu&#x27;s sentence was over, Bing hired her out of his own pocket to continue to serve as a wet nurse for several months, before letting her leave. Later, the budget for taking care of Bingyi was cut off from the imperial clan affairs budget, and Bing took money out of his own salary to care for Bingyi. When he grew somewhat older, Bing heard that Consort Shi&#x27;s mother Zhenjun () and brother Shi Gong () survived the witchcraft incident, and so sought them out and had Bingyi delivered to the Shi residence. Lady Zhenjun then raised him herself.

Several years later, Bingyi&#x27;s granduncle Emperor Zhao found out that Bingyi was alive, and ordered that the Ministry of Imperial Clan Affairs take over the duty for caring for Bingyi. The chief eunuch at the palace Zhang He (), who had previously been an advisor to Prince Ju before he was castrated by Emperor Wu in the aftermath of Prince Ju&#x27;s death, cared well for young Bingyi, and paid for his expenses and studies out of his own pocket.

=== Young adulthood and marriage ===
Circa 76 BC, Zhang wanted to marry his granddaughter to Bingyi, but his brother Zhang Anshi (), then an important official, opposed, fearing that it would bring trouble. Zhang, instead, invited one of his subordinate eunuchs (who had also been castrated by Emperor Wu), Xu Guanghan (), to dine, and persuaded him to marry his daughter Xu Pingjun to him. When Xu&#x27;s wife heard this, she became extremely angry and refused, but because Zhang was Xu&#x27;s superior, Xu did not dare to renege on the promise, and Bingyi and Pingjun were married, in a ceremony entirely paid by Zhang (because Bingyi could not afford it). Zhang also paid the bride price.

After marriage, Bingyi depended on his wife&#x27;s family and his grandmother&#x27;s family for support, and he hired a teacher to teach him the Confucian classics. He was a diligent learner, and he also had a strong sense of social justice. As a teenager, he had many friends from all walks of life and was able to see the dark sides of society and the suffering of the people at the hands of corrupt officials. He had a strong interest in hiking. Occasionally he was summoned to see Emperor Zhao. Pingjun gave birth to a son, Liu Shi.

== Succession to the throne ==
After Emperor Zhao died in 74 BC at the age of 20, the regent Huo Guang initially offered the throne to Prince He of Changyi. However, after Prince He quickly showed his unsuitability to be an emperor, Huo removed him from the throne. Huo, however, could not find a suitable successor among the princes. At Bing&#x27;s recommendation (although the exact process behind the scenes was not completely clear), Huo, with Zhang Anshi&#x27;s concurrence, decided to offer the throne to Bingyi, then 17, an offer ratified by Huo&#x27;s granddaughter Empress Dowager Shangguan. To avoid having a commoner take the throne, 27 days after Prince He was removed from the throne, Empress Dowager Shangguan first created him the Marquess of Yangwu. On the same day, he was offered the imperial seal and ribbon and the throne, and he accepted.

== Early reign ==
When Emperor Xuan accepted the throne, his son Prince Shi was barely a few months old. Prince Shi&#x27;s mother Xu Pingjun was initially created a consort. When it came time to create an empress, the officials largely wanted Emperor Xuan to marry Huo Guang&#x27;s daughter Huo Chengjun () and make her empress. Emperor Xuan did not explicitly reject this proposal but issued an order to seek out the sword that he owned as a commoner. Getting the hint, the officials recommended Consort Xu as empress, and she was created as such late in 74 BC. He initially wanted to make his father-in-law Xu Guanghan a marquess, but Huo opposed, reasoning a eunuch who had suffered castration as a punishment should not be made a marquess. Instead, Xu was given the title of Lord of Changcheng ().

In 73 BC, Huo offered to be relieved of his responsibilities as a regent. Emperor Xuan declined and ordered that all important matters of the state and the army would still be submitted to Huo first, and by doing this, the Emperor&#x27;s affairs will be done, so Huo continued to &quot;talking for the Emperor&quot;. He also gave high positions to Huo&#x27;s son Huo Yu () and grandnephews Huo Yun () and Huo Shan (), as well as Huo&#x27;s sons-in-law Fan Mingyou () and Deng Guanghan (). In many ways, Emperor Xuan, although now emperor, remained intimidated by the powers of Huo and was always humble in front of him. In that same year, Emperor Xuan restored posthumous titles to his grandparents and parents (although, perhaps out of the respect to Emperor Zhao&#x27;s memory, Crown Prince Ju received the rather unflattering posthumous name &quot;Li&quot; (戾, &quot;unrepenting&quot;)) and reburied them with honor. In 67 BC, he also finally found his maternal grandmother and her family, and he rewarded his grandmother and uncles with riches, and made his uncles marquesses.

Huo Guang&#x27;s wife Xian () was granted her wish of wanting her daughter become an empress. In 71 BC, Empress Xu was pregnant when Lady Xian came up with a plot. She bribed Empress Xu&#x27;s female physician Chunyu Yan (), under the guise of giving Empress Xu medicine after birth, to poison her. Chunyu did so, and Empress Xu died shortly after she gave birth. Her doctors were initially arrested to investigate whether they cared for the empress properly. Lady Xian, alarmed, informed Huo Guang what had happened, and Huo, not wanting to turn in his wife, instead signed Chunyu&#x27;s release.

In that same year, a major battle with Xiongnu occurred. Xiongnu had been incessantly attacking the Xiyu (central Asia) kingdom of Wusun, whose queen was the Han princess Liu Jieyou (). Emperor Xuan commissioned five generals and coordinated a plan with Wusun to attack Xiongnu at the same time. Xiongnu put the strongest defenses against the Han generals, the battle were largely inconclusively, but with the western frontier now weakened, Wusun forces won a major victory over Xiongnu, severely crippling Xiongnu&#x27;s western region. For years after, without Han engaging major forces, Xiongnu was constantly under attack by Dingling from the north, Wuhuan from the east, and Wusun from the west, and became unable to harass Han borders.

In 70 BC, Emperor Xuan made Huo Chengjun empress. Accustomed to luxury living, her palace expendes far exceeding the late Empress Xu.

Emperor Xuan&#x27;s early reign was generally known for his willingness to innovate, to commission officials who were lenient on the people, and to listen to advice. For example, in 67 BC, based on a submission from a Justice Ministry official Lu Wenshu (), who was concerned about the harshness of the criminal justice system, Emperor Xuan added four appellate judges who were in charge of hearing final appeals. While this fell well short of what Lu suggested, it did help to somewhat reform the justice system.

== The destruction of the Huo clan ==
In 68 BC, Huo Guang died. Emperor Xuan and Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan made the nearly-unprecedented act of personally attending Huo&#x27;s wake and built an impressive mausoleum for Huo. After Huo&#x27;s death, Zhang Anshi and Wei Xiang () became Emperor Xuan&#x27;s most powerful advisors, but Emperor Xuan assumed far more personal powers than he had during Huo&#x27;s lifetime. Later, Bing Ji (who had not yet revealed by this point the extent of his contribution to the emperor&#x27;s survival in his young age) also became a key official. Huo&#x27;s son, grandnephews, and sons-in-law remained in key posts, however.

In 67 BC, Emperor Xuan made Prince Shi—the late Empress Xu&#x27;s son—crown prince and made Empress Xu&#x27;s father Xu Guanghan the Marquess of Ping&#x27;en—an action that Huo Guang had opposed. Huo&#x27;s wife Lady Xian was shocked and displeased because if her daughter were to have a son later, that son could only be a prince and not the future emperor. She instructed her daughter to murder the crown prince. Allegedly, Empress Huo did make multiple attempts to do so but failed each time. Around this time, the emperor also heard rumors that the Huo clan had murdered Empress Xu, which led him to begin stripping the Huos of actual power while giving them impressive titles.

In 66 BC, after there had been increasing public rumors that the Huo clan had murdered Empress Xu, Lady Xian finally revealed to her son and grandnephews that she had, indeed, murdered Empress Xu. In fear of what the emperor might do if he had actual proof, Lady Xian, her son, her grandnephews, and her sons-in-law formed a conspiracy to depose the emperor. The conspiracy was discovered, and Emperor Xuan executed the entire Huo clan—an act that later drew heavy criticism from historians for its his ungratefulness to Huo Guang. (e.g., Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian.) (For the time being, Empress Huo was deposed but not executed, but 12 years later she was exiled; in response, she committed suicide.)

== Middle reign ==
During the middle stage of his reign, Emperor Xuan&#x27;s administration continued to be known for the promotion of honest officials who generally cared for the people. It was also marked by further fostering of relationships with Xiyu kingdoms, making them strong vassals. He was also characterized by attention to detail and willingness to have correspondences with his generals in which he kindly but firmly had concrete discussions with them on proper military strategy in dealing with minority tribes and foreign nations. An example could be seen in his correspondences with General Zhao Chongguo () in 62 BC to 60 BC when Zhao was on a mission to pacify the Qiang tribes, some of which were rebelling and some of which were considering a rebellion. Zhao opposed the annihilation strategy that other generals had proposed. Emperor Xuan had initially approved the plan and establish military settlements to better prepare for any future rebellions. Eventually, Emperor Xuan agreed to advocated for better treatment of the tribes, and the Qiang tribes were pacified without any major bloodshed. Also, after a short foray into magic in 61 BC, Emperor Xuan realized the foolishness of seeking immortality and pursuing it would-be a costly venture (unlike, his great-grandfather Emperor Wu and many emperors before him).

In 64 BC, Emperor Xuan considered creating a new empress. At that time, his favorite consorts were Consorts Hua, Zhang, and Wei. He was seriously considering making Consort Zhang, the mother of his son Liu Qin (later the Prince of Huaiyang), empress but he was still a bit traumatized over the fact Empress Huo nearly succeeded in poisoning Crown Prince Shi, and fearing that it would happen again if Consort Zhang where to be made emperess. He resolve this by choosing to create an empress who did not have a sons of her own, was kind and gentle but hard and strict when time comes and have moral values. He created Consort Wang, not one of his favorites consort, empress, and had her raise Crown Prince Shi as her own son.

That same year, he also changed his name to Xun (), to make it easier for the people to carry out &quot;naming taboo&quot; (the avoidance of using the emperor&#x27;s name in speech or writing in respect of the emperor), because &quot;bing&quot; and &quot;yi&quot; were both common characters that were hard to avoid.

In 63 BC, having realized the extent of Bing&#x27;s contributions to him, Emperor Xuan decided to repay him, and others who were involved in his upbringing, for their kindness. Bing and several others, in addition to Zhang He&#x27;s adopted son, were created, marquesses. The prison guards who had treated him with kindness were also rewarded. His nurses Hu and Guo had already died by this point, but their descendants were tracked down and rewarded.

== Late reign ==
Late in his reign, Emperor Xuan began to moderately become luxurious in living but was still comparatively thrifty in his expenditures. He also began to relax from his early diligence in governing the state. He also became less diligent in the inspection of false reports by officials. For example, there were large numbers of reported sightings of &quot;fenghuang&quot; (Chinese phoenixes) – mythological birds who were considered symbols of divine favor—during this period, and while in ancient China there might have been &quot;legitimate&quot; sightings of phoenixes (that is, rare birds that were then-considered phoenixes), a good number of these reports were later shown to be likely hoaxes, but Emperor Xuan accepted these reports without critically examining them: although in the case of reported sightings of a green rooster and golden horse in Shu (modern Sichuan), Xuan did dispatch one of his favored poets and a Shu native, Wang Bao, to investigate and to bring back the golden horse, if found (though Wang became ill and died on the way). However, in general, Emperor Xuan&#x27;s reign, even in this period, was marked by his concern for the people and unwillingness to undertake military action unless necessary. For example, in 59 BC, a major Xiongnu civil war broke out—which would leave the Xiongnu princes fighting each other for years. Many generals wanted to use this opportunity to completely and thoroughly annihilating the Xiongnu. But Emperor Xuan didn&#x27;t want to do so, rather he encouraged peace among the Xiongnu princes with hopes of having them submit to him.

His efforts paid off. By 56 BC, Xiongnu had been fractured into three separate regimes, ruled by &quot;Chanyus&quot; Runzhen (), Huhanye (), and Zhizhi. All three sought peace with Han, and Han was able to reduce its military defense forces by a fifth, decreasing the burdens on the people correspondingly. In 54 BC, Chanyu Runzhen was defeated and killed by Chanyu Zhizhi, who further sought to try to defeat Chanyu Huhanye to reunify Xiongnu. In response, in 53 BC, at the advice of his official, Chanyu Huhanye headed south and requested to become a Han vassal to seek Han protection. In 51 BC, Chanyu Huhanye made an official visit to Chang&#x27;an as a Han vassal, and Emperor Xuan, correctly judging that he should seek to have Huhanye submit to him out of gratitude and not of fear, ordered that Huhanye not be required to bow to him and that he be treated as higher than imperial princes. Emperor Xuan also commissioned an expedition force to assist Chanyu Huhanye in defending his territory. In 49 BC, Chanyu Huhanye made a second visit. With Han assistance, his strength grew, and Chanyu Zhizhi, who had previously been stronger, was forced to move west.

In 53 BC, disappointed in Crown Prince Shi&#x27;s overreliance on Confucian officials and lack of resolve, he considered making Liu Qin, the Prince of Huaiyang, the crown prince instead, but could not bring himself to do so—remembering how Prince Shi&#x27;s mother Empress Xu was his first love and had been murdered by poisoning, and also how he depended on his father-in-law in his youth.

In 51 BC, after Chanyu Huhanye&#x27;s visit, Emperor Xuan, in his most shining moment, remembered key officials who had been instrumental in his success. In an unprecedented action, he had the portraits of 11 of them be painted onto the main gallery of the main imperial palace, the Weiyang Palace. The 11 officials were:

* Huo Guang
* Zhang Anshi
* Han Zeng ()
* Zhao Chongguo
* Wei Xiang
* Bing Ji
* Du Yannian ()
* Liu De ()
* Liang Qiuhe ()
* Xiao Wangzhi ()
* Su Wu

Huo was referred only by titles and not by name—which was considered an even greater honor than given to the other 10.

By this time, the Western Han dynasty would reach its peak in terms of territorial size, even greater than during the reign of Emperor Wu.
Emperor Xuan died in 49 BC. He was succeeded by Crown Prince Shi, as Emperor Yuan. His tomb Duling () is located some 15 km southeast of the city of Xi&#x27;an.

==Culture==
Xuan&#x27;s court was somewhat of a literary center, something which extended to his royal hunts, which he turned into somewhat of a poetry competition for accompanying poets. Among the literary figures at his court were Wang Bao and Liu Xiang.

<text>Frederik X (Frederik André Henrik Christian, ; born 26 May 1968) is King of Denmark. He acceded to the throne following his mother&#x27;s abdication on 14 January 2024.

Frederik is the elder son of Margrethe II and Prince Henrik. He was born during the reign of his maternal grandfather, King Frederik IX, and became Crown Prince of Denmark following his mother&#x27;s accession in 1972. He was educated privately at home and at Krebs School, École des Roches and Øregård Gymnasium. He earned a Master of Science degree in political science from Aarhus University. After university, he served in diplomatic posts at the United Nations and in Paris. He has trained in all three branches of the Danish Armed Forces.

Frederik met Australian marketing consultant Mary Donaldson while attending the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. They married on 14 May 2004 at Copenhagen Cathedral. They have four children: Christian, Isabella, Vincent and Josephine.

==Early life and education==
Frederik was born by emergency caesarean section at Rigshospitalet, the Copenhagen University Hospital in Copenhagen, on 26 May 1968 at 23:50 to the then Princess Margrethe (later Queen Margrethe II), oldest daughter of King Frederik IX and heir presumptive to the Danish throne, and Prince Henrik. At the time of his birth, his maternal grandfather was on the throne of Denmark and his matrilineal great-grandfather, Gustaf VI Adolf, was on the throne of Sweden.

He was baptised on 24 June 1968, at Holmen Church, in Copenhagen. He was named Frederik after his maternal grandfather, King Frederik IX, continuing the Danish royal tradition of the heir apparent being named either Frederik or Christian. He became Crown Prince of Denmark when his mother ascended to the throne on 14 January 1972. Frederik&#x27;s only sibling is Prince Joachim of Denmark.

Frederik attended primary school at Krebs&#x27; Skole between 1974 and 1981, as a private pupil at Amalienborg Palace from 1974 to 1976, and from the third form again at Krebs&#x27; Skole. From 1982 to 1983, he attended the , a boarding school in Normandy, France. In 1986, Frederik graduated from Øregård Gymnasium. In addition to Danish, he is fluent in French (his father&#x27;s language), English, and German.

In the autumn of 1989, Frederik began studying political science at Aarhus University. As part of his education, he spent the 1992–1993 academic year at Harvard University, where he studied political science under the name Frederik Henriksen. Whilst at Harvard, he participated in the Phoenix – SK Club, and lived in a rent-controlled apartment. Frederik is the first Danish royal to complete a university education.

==Early career==
Frederik took up a position for three months with the Danish UN mission in New York in 1994. In 1995, he obtained his MSc degree in political science from Aarhus University. He completed the course in the prescribed number of years with an exam result above average, thus becoming the first royal to obtain a master&#x27;s degree. His final paper was an analysis on the foreign policy of the Baltic States, which he had visited several times during his studies. The prince was posted as First Secretary to the Danish Embassy in Paris from October 1998 to October 1999.

==Military service==
Frederik has completed extensive military studies and training in all three services, including training as a frogman in the naval elite special operations forces Frømandskorpset. It was there that he earned the nickname &quot;Pingo&quot;, when his wetsuit filled with water and he was forced to waddle like a penguin.

In 2001 and 2002, he completed further leadership training at the Royal Danish Defence College. Frederik remained active in the defence services, and in the period 2002–2003 served as a staff officer at Defence Command Denmark, and from 2003 as a senior lecturer with the Institute of Strategy at the Royal Danish Defence College.

==Marriage and children==
During a Council of State on 8 October 2003, Queen Margrethe gave her consent to the marriage of Crown Prince Frederik to Mary Elizabeth Donaldson, an Australian marketing consultant whom the prince had met while attending the Sydney Olympics in 2000. Their wedding took place on 14 May 2004 at Copenhagen Cathedral, Copenhagen.

The couple have four children: Christian (born 15 October 2005), Isabella (born 21 April 2007), and twins Vincent and Josephine (born 8 January 2011).

==Reign==

Queen Margrethe II announced her abdication during her annual live broadcast New Year&#x27;s Eve address on 31 December 2023. Frederik succeeded her as King of Denmark on 14 January 2024, after Margrethe formally signed an instrument of abdication during a meeting of the Council of State.

After succeeding to the throne, he was proclaimed king from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace by Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen as has been the custom for Danish monarchs since the introduction of the constitutional monarchy in 1849. His motto is (English: &quot;United, committed, for the Kingdom of Denmark&quot;), the first motto that does not mention God since Frederik VII.

On 15 January, the royal family appeared in Parliament for a ceremony marking the transition of head of state. On 21 January, the royal family attended a celebratory church service at Aarhus Cathedral, led by the Bishop of Aarhus and Royal Chaplain-in-Ordinary, Henrik Wigh-Poulsen.

On 31 January 2024, Frederik visited Poland and was received by its president Andrzej Duda, in his first overseas trip as monarch. Danish monarchs traditionally travel first to another Scandinavian country, but Frederik had planned the trip prior to Margrethe&#x27;s abdication.

The King and Queen made their first state visits in May 2024, visiting Sweden and Norway. In June, they toured Greenland, one of the autonomous territories of the Kingdom of Denmark. Their planned tour of the Faroe Islands was postponed due to workers&#x27; strikes. The tour is now scheduled for 2025.

In November 2024 the Royal Court announced that the King had decided to phase out the system of granting companies royal warrants, which has been extant in Denmark since the 19th century. The motivation was that a system in which companies can claim special recognition from the royal house was not in keeping with the times. All warrants and similar titles are to be phased out by 31 December 2029.

In January 2025, when U.S president elect Donald Trump renewed talks about the intended U.S purchase of Greenland, the King held a speech promoting unity and collaboration within the Kingdom of Denmark. He also issued a royal decree to update the royal coat of arms from his mother&#x27;s 1972 design. The changes included increasing the sizes of the symbols of Greenland and the Faroe Islands to make them more prominent. The new design “strengthens the prominence of the Commonwealth in the royal coat of arms,” according to a statement made by the royal house on January 1, 2025.

==Personal interests==

===Scientific research, climate change and sustainability===
Frederik has a special interest in scientific research, climate change, and sustainability. For his commitment to sustainability, he was interviewed by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and CNN International&#x27;s &quot;Future Cities&quot; program. He participated in expeditions, forums and events on climate. The prince has represented Denmark as a promoter of sustainable Danish energy. The prince was one of the authors of the &quot;Kongelig Polartokt&quot; (Polar Cruise Royal), about the challenges of climate, published in 2009 with a preface written by Kofi Annan. In 2010, he wrote the foreword to the highschool textbook &quot;Naturen og klimaændringerne i Nordøstgrønland&quot; (Nature and climate change in Northeast Greenland). He supports scientific research projects, as a patron, as expeditionary, with regular attendance at events and through his foundation, &quot;Kronprins Frederiks Fond&quot;.

===Sports and health===
The King encourages Danish participation in sports. He is a patron and honorary member of various sports organizations, and a former member of the International Olympic Committee. He also promotes an active lifestyle in society.

Frederik is an avid sportsman, running marathons in Copenhagen, New York, and Paris, and completing the 42 kilometers with a respectable time of 3 hours, 22 minutes and 50 seconds in the Copenhagen Marathon. In 2013, he completed the KMD Ironman Copenhagen in the time of 10:45:32 and is the first royal person to complete an Ironman.

Frederik is a keen sailor, being a competitive Farr 40 skipper as well as an accomplished Dragon boater. At the 2003 Dragon European Championship, where 51 boats participated, the Prince and his crew had been leading after four out of six races; they finished in fourth place. At the 2008 Farr 40 World Championship with 33 boats participating, Frederik and his crew also took fourth place. He was the first in his class boat in Fyn Cup 2010 in Denmark, and number 4 in the 2011 Danish Dragon Championship with 25 boats participating.

In 2016, on the subject of the Olympics in Rio, Frederik told the press that he did not regret not chasing his dream to compete in the Olympics after meeting his wife. He had always thought about training and competing, but that would have required him to limit his activities and concentrate on training, instead, he put his energy into other aspects of life. In October 2016, Frederik had to cancel his appearance at the royal reception for the Danish Olympic and Paralympic athletes after he fractured his spine while jumping on a trampoline with his eldest son.

Frederik also took part in the relay event during the 2019 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Aarhus in March 2019.

Frederik has competed in cross-country skiing; he skied the Swedish Vasaloppet, the oldest cross-country ski race in the world, in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In 2016, he completed the Norwegian Birkebeinerrennet with Norway&#x27;s Crown Prince Haakon. Also in 2016, Frederik completed the in Sisimiut, Greenland.

====International Olympic Committee====

On 9 October 2009, Crown Prince Frederik was elected a member of the International Olympic Committee, replacing former Danish member Kaj Holm, who had reached the age of retirement. The Crown Prince&#x27;s candidature was met with some skepticism in Denmark, as it would mean that the Crown Prince would be on a semi-political committee along with several people who are suspected or even convicted of criminal acts. Another concern was whether or not the Crown Prince&#x27;s loyalty would be towards his country and government, as the Danish constitution prescribes, or with the International Olympic Committee, as is sworn upon election to the committee. The Crown Prince was given special observer status in National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark, as a way to allow him to work, without having political power.

Frederik announced that his point of focus and reason for joining the International Olympic Committee is to promote an active lifestyle among youth. He was elected for an eight-year term, and made it clear that he would terminate his membership upon ascending the Danish throne.

In 2012, Frederik carried the Olympic flame through Notting Hill, a neighbourhood in West London.

In 2016, Frederik faced criticism for voting against Danish Minister for Culture Bertel Haarder and a majority in the Danish Parliament&#x27;s wishes on the subject of whether or not Russia should be allowed to compete at the 2016 Summer Olympics following allegations of state-sponsored doping.

On 19 June 2017, the Crown Prince announced that he would continue another term of 8 years. However, in 2021, Frederik was announced that he would step down as an active member of the International Olympic Committee at the committee&#x27;s annual session prior to the 2020 Summer Olympics, citing a wish to intensify his everyday work as the reason for stepping down in the middle of his term.

====Royal Run====
In celebration of his 50th birthday, on 21 May 2018, Frederik initiated a public running event across five cities in Denmark called with more than 70,000 participants, including himself and his own family. The event was generally deemed as &quot;exceeding expectations&quot; by the public.

The event has since become annual, and was continued in 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The 2020 version was cancelled due to the COVID-19 situation in Denmark. The 2024 edition took place on 20 May in Copenhagen/Frederiksberg, Kalundborg, Fredericia, Aarhus, and Brønderslev.

===Expeditions===
The Crown Prince participated in an expedition to Mongolia in 1986. In 2000, the Crown Prince participated in &quot;Expedition Sirius 2000&quot;, which was a four-month and 2,795 km dog-sledge expedition in the northern part of Greenland. The expedition Sirius marked the 50-year anniversary of the Sirius Patrol. Prince Frederik was part of the polar expedition as a film photographer, whose job was to ensure an optimal coverage of this event.

==Crown Prince Frederik&#x27;s Foundation==
The purpose of the foundation is to provide financial assistance to students of social policy and sciences, for one year&#x27;s study at Harvard. It also provides financial support for scientific expeditions, particularly to foreign parts of the world, such as Greenland and the Faroe Islands, and sports purposes, including those with a particularly social aspect.

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==
===Titles and styles===
Frederik was originally styled &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Frederik of Denmark&quot;. On the accession of his mother on 14 January 1972, he became known as &quot;His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Denmark&quot;. The title Count of Monpezat was added when his mother created it for her male-line descendants.
Since his accession on 14 January 2024, he has been styled &quot;His Majesty The King, Count of Monpezat&quot;.

===Honours===

The King has received a number of honours.

<doc id="339158" wikidata="Q237782" url="?curid=339158" title="Boris Trajkovski">
<text>Boris Trajkovski (GCMG) (, pronounced ; 25 June 1956 – 26 February 2004) was a Macedonian politician who served as the second President of Macedonia from 1999 until his death in 2004 in a plane crash.

== Early life ==

Trajkovski was born into a Methodist family. Trajkovski graduated in 1980 with a degree in law from the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje. He subsequently specialized in commercial and employment law and made several visits to the United States, where he studied theology to become a Methodist lay minister.

After he finished his studies, the communist government confined him for a time to a remote village because of his religious activities. There he took care of Kočani, an impoverished partly Romani congregation of the United Methodist Church of Macedonia, connected to the United States&#x27; United Methodist Church. Following political liberalisation in the 1980s, he went on to head the legal department of the Sloboda construction company in Skopje. He served as Methodist youth secretary in the former Yugoslavia for over 12 years. Later he was President of the Church Council of the Macedonian Evangelical Methodist Church. From 1988 he took part in the ongoing Youth Exchange programme between the Methodist Church of Macedonia and the Berkhamsted and Hemel Hempstead Methodist Circuit in England. In 1991, he studied English at a Christian language college in Bournemouth, England.

== Career in politics ==

Trajkovski became active in politics following the Republic of Macedonia&#x27;s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in November 1991, when he joined the VMRO-DPMNE party. He played an important role in developing the party&#x27;s relations with other European political parties and was appointed Chairman of the party&#x27;s Foreign Relations Commission. In 1997, he became the Chief of Staff of the Mayor of Kisela Voda, a municipality in Skopje. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs on 21 December 1998 but served in this post for less than a year.

Largely because of his reputation as a moderate reformist, Trajkovski was selected as VMRO-DPMNE&#x27;s candidate for president in the November 1999 election held to replace the outgoing president, Kiro Gligorov. In the presidential election of 14 November 1999, Trajkovski defeated Tito Petkovski by 52% to 45%. He was scheduled to take office just five days later, on 19 November, but because the results were disputed, parliamentary chairman Savo Klimovski became acting president until Petkovski&#x27;s supporters lost their last appeal a month later.

Trajkovski&#x27;s term was marked by tensions between ethnic Macedonians and the republic&#x27;s large ethnic Albanian minority. The aftermath of the Kosovo War led to months of violent armed clashes between Macedonian security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels, supported by the Albanian National Army (ANA, AKSh), seeking improvements on their status as a legitimate minority and generally better economical, administrative and legal conditions. During the conflict, protests occurred due to the Macedonian assault on Aračinovo being halted, the evacuation of ~500 NLA insurgents, and the involvement of the international community. Protesters broke into the Parliament building and demanded to talk to the President shouting &quot;treason&quot; and &quot;resignation.&quot; Although his powers were limited and his role largely ceremonial, he presided over a NATO-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended the violence and prevented a full-blown civil war in the Republic of Macedonia. He was seen as a moderate in the ethnic dialogue, arguing for greater inclusion of ethnic Albanians, and has been credited with being a key figure in resolving the conflict. Boris Trajkovski&#x27;s friend and advisor was his chief of staff Zoran Jolevski, who was the Macedonian Ambassador in the United States of America and the negotiator of the state name in the Macedonia name dispute.

In 2002, he was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George by Queen Elizabeth II. In the same year, Trajkovski was awarded the World Methodist Peace Award by the World Methodist Council for his role in promoting peace and political stability.

== Death ==
Trajkovski died on 26 February 2004 in a plane crash en route to an economic conference in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The aircraft crashed in thick fog and heavy rain on a mountainside in southeastern Herzegovina, near the villages of Poplat and Vrsnik eight miles (15km) south-south-east of Mostar. He is the only President of North Macedonia to die in office.

Eight other people were also aboard but none survived the impact, which broke the aircraft into three pieces. It came down in an area that had been heavily mined during the Bosnian War of the 1990s, which significantly hampered the rescue and recovery efforts; being difficult to handle, and as the runway is not equipped with precision landing systems, it is especially challenging in inclement weather.

After his death, there was a state funeral in his honour. On his gravestone in Strumica is the verse Matthew 5:9 from the Bible which states &quot;Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the sons of God.&quot;

His family continue his legacy through the Boris Trajkovski Foundation.

<doc id="339164" wikidata="Q1207513" url="?curid=339164" title="Leduc, Alberta">
<text>Leduc ( ) is a city in the province of Alberta, Canada. It is south of the provincial capital of Edmonton and is part of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region.

== History ==
Leduc was established in 1891 by Robert Telford, a settler who had bought land near a lake which would later bear his name. It was on that piece of land where the new settlement would take root. Telford established a stopping place for the stagecoach line that in 1889 connected Calgary to Edmonton. It became known as Telford&#x27;s Place. Telford previously served as an officer for the North-West Mounted Police, and later became Leduc&#x27;s first postmaster, first general merchantman, and first justice of the peace. He was also elected to serve as Leduc&#x27;s first Member of the Alberta Legislature (MLA) in 1905.

The establishment of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway, later acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railway, opened the region to settlement. The first train stopped at Leduc in July 1891.

Originally there were two versions to describe how Leduc got its name. In fact both accounts are true. In April 1886 when a settler (McKinley) setting up a telegraph office needed a name for the new station and decided that it would be named after the first person who came through the door of the telegraph office. That person was Father Hippolyte Leduc, a priest who had served the area since 1867. Five years later, in 1891, the Minister of the Interior and Superintendent of Indian Affairs, who had been Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, Edgar Dewdney (1835–1916), was given a list of names, that had been provided to the railroad by Father Lacombe, decided that Telford Place should be renamed at the time the railway terminal was being established. Father Leduc&#x27;s name was on the list and since the telegraph station was already called Leduc Dewdney saw no reason why not to use Leduc&#x27;s name for the new railroad station and the hamlet that was growing alongside.

Leduc was incorporated as a village in 1899, and became a town in 1906. It became a city in 1983; by that time its population had reached 12,000.

The town continued to grow quietly over the decades and Alberta&#x27;s historical oil strike on February 13, 1947, occurred near the town at the Leduc No. 1 oil well.

== Geography ==

<text>The Great Baltimore Fire raged in Baltimore, Maryland from Sunday February 7 to Monday February 8, 1904. In the fire, more than 1,500 buildings were completely leveled, and some 1,000 severely damaged, bringing property loss from the disaster to an estimated $100 million. 1,231 firefighters helped bring the blaze under control, both professional paid truck and engine companies from the Baltimore City Fire Department (B.C.F.D.) and volunteers from the surrounding counties and outlying towns of Maryland, as well as out-of-state units that arrived on the major railroads. It destroyed much of central Baltimore, including over 1,500 buildings covering an area of some .

From North Howard Street in the west and southwest, the flames spread north through the retail shopping area as far as Fayette Street and began moving eastward, pushed along by the prevailing winds. Narrowly missing the new 1900 Circuit Courthouse, now the Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. Courthouse, fire passed the historic Battle Monument Square from 1815 to 1827 at North Calvert Street, and the quarter-century-old Baltimore City Hall, built in 1875 on Holliday Street; and finally spread further east to the Jones Falls stream which divided the downtown business district from the old East Baltimore tightly-packed residential neighborhoods of Jonestown (also known as Old Town) and newly named &quot;Little Italy&quot;. The fire&#x27;s wide swath burned as far south as the wharves and piers lining the north side of the old &quot;Basin&quot; (today&#x27;s &quot;Inner Harbor&quot;) of the Northwest Branch of the Baltimore Harbor and Patapsco River facing along Pratt Street.

It is considered historically the third worst conflagration in an American city, surpassed only by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, and the San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906. Other major urban disasters that were comparable (but not fires) were the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 and most recently, Hurricane Katrina that hit New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico coast in August 2005. One reason for the fire&#x27;s long duration involved the lack of national standards in firefighting equipment. Despite fire engines from nearby cities (such as Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. as well as units from New York City, Virginia, Wilmington, and Atlantic City) responding with horse-drawn pumpers, wagons and other related equipment (primitive by modern-day standards, but only steam engines were motorized in that era) carried by the railroads on flat cars and in box cars, many were unable to help since their hose couplings could not fit Baltimore&#x27;s fire hydrants.

Much of the destroyed area was rebuilt in relatively short order, and the city adopted a building code, stressing fireproof materials. Perhaps the greatest legacy of the fire was the impetus it gave to efforts to standardize firefighting equipment in the United States, especially hose couplings.

== Background ==
In centuries past, fires regularly ravaged cities, frequently destroying large areas within. Close living quarters; lax, unenforced, or non-existent building codes; and a widespread dearth of firefighting services were all contributing factors to the frequency and extent of urban fires. The rapid expansion of American cities during the nineteenth century also contributed to the danger.

In addition, firefighting practices and equipment were largely unstandardized, with each city having its own system. As time passed, these cities invested more in the systems that they already had, increasing the costs of any conversion. In addition, early equipment was often patented by its manufacturer. By 1903, over 600 sizes and variations of fire hose couplings existed in the United States. Despite efforts to establish standards being made since the 1870s, they had little effect: no city wanted to abandon its system, few saw any reason to adopt standards, and equipment manufacturers did not want competition.

== Progression of the fire ==

Fire was reported first at the John Hurst and Company building on West German Street at Hopkins Place (modern site at the southwest corner of the Baltimore Civic Center of 1962, currently the CFG Bank Arena) in the western part of downtown Baltimore at 10:48 a.m. on Sunday, February 7, and quickly spread. Soon, it became apparent that the fire was outstripping the ability of the city&#x27;s firefighting resources to fight it, and calls for help were telegraphed to other cities. By 1:30 p.m., units from Washington, D.C. were arriving on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Camden Street Station. To halt the fire, officials decided to use a firebreak, and dynamited buildings around the existing fire. This tactic, however, proved unsuccessful. Not until 5:00 p.m. the next day was the fire brought under control, after burning for thirty hours.

One reason for the fire&#x27;s duration was the lack of national standards in firefighting equipment. Fire crews and fire engines came from as far away as Philadelphia and Washington that day (units from New York City were blocked by a train accident; they arrived the next day – Monday, February 8). The crews brought their own equipment. Most could only watch helplessly after discovering that their hoses could not connect to Baltimore&#x27;s gauge size of water hydrants, although a machine shop in the Locust Point area of the city did start making coupling rings to overcome this problem. High winds and freezing temperatures further contributed to the fire&#x27;s extent and firefighters&#x27; difficulties. As a result, the fire burned over 30 hours, destroying 1,545 buildings spanning 70 city blocks—amounting to over .

While Baltimore was criticized for its hydrants, this problem was not uniquely its own. During that era, American cities had more than six hundred different sizes and variations of fire hose couplings. As outside firefighters returned to their home cities, newspapers published interviews that condemned Baltimore and exaggerated locals&#x27; response during the crisis. In addition, many newspapers published accounts by travelers who, in actuality, had only seen the fire as their trains passed through Baltimore. Nonetheless, the responding agencies and their equipment did prove useful, since the uncouplable hoses only represented a small part of the transported equipment. Ultimately, the tragedy led to the standardization of hydrants nationwide.

In addition to firefighters, outside police officers, as well as the Maryland National Guard and the Naval Brigade, were utilized during the fire to maintain order and protect the city. Police and soldiers not only kept looters away, but also prevented civilians from inadvertently interfering with firefighting efforts. The Naval Brigade secured the waterfront and waterways to keep spectators away. Officers from Philadelphia and New York also assisted the City Police Department.

Thomas Albert Lurz (b. January 9, 1874), a Baltimore native and letter carrier with the U.S. Post Office, rescued tons of mail from the burning Central Post Office on the east side of Battle Monument Square, on North Calvert Street, between East Lexington and Fayette Streets. Lurz gathered a group of men who loaded bags of mail onto horse–drawn wagons, took them to North and Pennsylvania Avenues, and stood guard until the Maryland National Guard arrived (for which he later received a commendation). Meanwhile, back at the General Post Office, employees kept spraying water on the building&#x27;s sides and roof and were able to minimize damage and save the 1889 Italian Renaissance edifice with its nine towers and central tall clock tower (later razed and replaced by the current 1932 building, later converted to city use as Courthouse East).

== Aftermath ==
In the aftermath, 35,000 people were left unemployed. Over $150 million (in 1904 USD) worth of damage was done, which is approximately $3.84 billion in 2014 dollars.

Immediately after the fire, &quot;The Baltimore News&quot; quoted Mayor Robert McLane: &quot;To suppose that the spirit of our people will not rise to the occasion is to suppose that our people are not genuine Americans. We shall make the fire of 1904 a landmark not of decline but of progress.&quot; McLane then refused assistance, &quot;As head of this municipality, I cannot help but feel gratified by the sympathy and the offers of practical assistance which have been tendered to us. To them I have in general terms replied, &#x27;Baltimore will take care of its own, thank you.&#x27;&quot;

Two years later, on September 10, 1906, &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that the city had risen from the ashes and that &quot;One of the great disasters of modern time had been converted into a blessing.&quot;


Most agreed that the Great Fire directly caused no deaths. An autobiography written by Alice Mae Cawthorne tells of a couple named Mr. and Mrs. Chambre who lost their twin daughters in the Baltimore fire. There are also reports of a merchant suffering a heart attack while evacuating goods from his store. 
It may be that deaths were not recorded accurately. In 1907 a bronze historical marker commemorating &quot;The Great Fire&quot; was placed next to the main western entrance of the &quot;Wholesale Fish Market&quot; (now the Port Discovery children&#x27;s museum), one of three new adjoining Centre Market structures replacing the old burned second &quot;Centre Market&quot; building and Maryland Institute of 1851. Since the late 1980s, the structure has been renamed the Port Discovery children&#x27;s museum. This major commemorative tablet reads &quot;Lives Lost: None.&quot; However, a recently rediscovered newspaper story from &quot;The Sun&quot; tells of the charred remains of a &quot;colored man&quot; being pulled, almost two weeks after the fire, from the harbor basin, near the modern Inner Harbor area Dock (old Pier 2).

Five lost lives were indirectly attributed to the fire. Two members of the 4th Regiment of the Maryland National Guard, Private John Undutch of Company &#x27;F&#x27;, and Second Lieutenant John V. Richardson of Company &#x27;E&#x27;, both fell ill and died of pneumonia. Fireman Mark Kelly and Fire Lieutenant John A. McKnew also died of pneumonia and tuberculosis due to exposure during the Great Fire. Martin Mullin, the proprietor of Mullin&#x27;s Hotel (on the northwest corner of West Baltimore and North Liberty Streets, above Hopkins Place), a block to the north of the John E. Hurst Building, where the fire started, also later died.

Mayor McLane&#x27;s mysterious and sudden death later that year, ruled a suicide, was also attributed by some of his contemporaries to the stress of post-fire reconstruction.

== Legacy ==

As a result of the fire, Baltimore finally adopted a city building code after seventeen nights of hearings and multiple City Council reviews. The city&#x27;s downtown &quot;Burnt District&quot; was rebuilt using more fireproof materials, such as granite pavers. Public pressure, coupled with demands of companies insuring the newly re-built buildings, spurred the effort.

The National Fire Protection Association adopted a national standard for fire hydrant and hose connections. However, inertia remained. Conversion was slow and still remains incomplete. One hundred years after the Baltimore Fire, only 18 of the 48 most populous American cities were reported to have national standard fire hydrants. Hose incompatibility contributed to the Oakland firestorm of 1991: although the standard hose coupling has diameter, Oakland&#x27;s hydrants had couplings.

H. L. Mencken, future famed columnist/commentator/author and linguist, survived the fire at the beginning of his blossoming journalism and literary career, but the offices of his newspaper, the &quot;Baltimore Herald&quot; (at the northwest corner of St. Paul and East Fayette Streets), were destroyed on the northern edge of the &quot;Burnt District&quot;. Mencken related the fire and its aftermath near the end of the second volume of his autobiographical trilogy, &quot;Newspaper Days: 1899–1906&quot;, published 1941, &quot;When I came out of it at last I was a settled and indeed almost a middle-aged man, spavined by responsibility and aching in every sinew, but I went into it a boy, and it was the hot gas of youth that kept me going.&quot;

&quot;The Herald&quot; printed an edition the first night of the fire on the press of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, in exchange for providing photographs to &quot;The Post&quot;, but could not continue this arrangement because of a long-standing arrangement between &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and the &quot;Baltimore Evening News&quot;. For the next five weeks &quot;The Herald&quot; was printed nightly on the press of the &quot;Philadelphia Evening Telegraph&quot; and transported to Baltimore on a special train, provided free of charge by the B&amp;O Railroad. The fire also devastated the city&#x27;s other major newspapers, including &quot;The Sun&quot; with its famous &quot;Iron Building&quot;, considered the forerunner of modern steel skyscrapers, built 1851 at East Baltimore Street. Across the intersecting South Street-Guilford Avenue was the publishing headquarters of the &quot;Baltimore Evening News&quot;, founded 1871 and built in 1873 with its mansard roof and corner clock tower. Baltimore&#x27;s oldest news publication, &quot;The Baltimore American&quot; (dating back to 1773 or 1796 by various accounts and owned and published by local civic titan, General Felix Agnus), was also burnt out of its offices and forced to have papers printed out-of-town and shipped back by train.

The &quot;Box 414 Association&quot;, which has assisted the Baltimore City Fire Department for many years, acts like a local American Red Cross, or military United Service Organization (USO), sending refreshments and break-time trucks to the sites of major alarms and fires to provide exhausted firefighters some comfort and snacks. It is named after the first alarm box pulled on the morning of Sunday, February 7, 1904.

The BCFD memorializes the fire annually at the bronze statue of a firefighter at the Department&#x27;s old headquarters, facing City Hall, the War Memorial Building and the broad ceremonial plaza in between at East Lexington and North Gay Streets. Observances are also held at the closest street corner to the Great Fire&#x27;s beginnings at South Howard and West Lombard Streets alongside the old Civic Center/Arena. The Maryland Historical Society commemorated the fire&#x27;s centennial in 2004 with a website, two books and various events, lectures, and tours through the auspices of the Fire Museum of Maryland on York Road in Lutherville-Timonium-Cockeysville in Baltimore County. Several commemorative stories and special sections were published during the month in Baltimore&#x27;s only remaining daily newspaper, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, and the four local television stations&#x27; and several documentaries and interviews/discussion programs on the city&#x27;s public radio network (NPR) station, WYPR-FM, also commemorated the event.

The folk song &quot;Baltimore Fire&quot; by Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers, recorded on Columbia Records (15509-D, May 6, 1929) also commemorates the event.
: &quot;Fire!, fire!, I heard the cry&quot;
: &quot;From every breeze that passes by&quot;
: &quot;All the world was one sad cry of pity&quot;
: &quot;Strong men in anguish prayed&quot;
: &quot;Calling out to the heavens for aid&quot;
: &quot;While the fire in ruins was laid&quot;
: &quot;Fair Baltimore, the beautiful city&quot;

More recently, the Baltimore-based rock band J. Roddy Walston and the Business memorialized the fire in &quot;Nineteen Ought Four&quot;, on their album &quot;Hail Mega Boys&quot;.

<text>Abdul Salam Mohammed ʿArif al-Jumayli (&quot;&quot;; 21 March 1921 – 13 April 1966) was an Iraqi military officer and politician who served as the second president of Iraq from 1963 until his death in a plane crash in 1966. He played a leading role in the 14 July Revolution, in which the Hashemite monarchy was overthrown on 14 July 1958.

== 1958 coup and conflict with Qasim ==
Along with Abdel Karim Qasim and other Iraqi military officers, Arif was a member of the clandestine organisation, the Free Officers of Iraq. Like Qasim, Arif served with distinction in the otherwise unsuccessful 1948 Arab–Israeli War, where he captured Jenin in what is now the West Bank part of Palestine. During the summer of 1958, Prime Minister Nuri al-Said ordered Iraqi troops under Arif to aid Jordan, as part of an agreement of the Arab Federation. Instead, however, he led his army units into Baghdad and on 14 July launched a coup against the Hashemite monarchy. Qasim formed a government under the newly proclaimed republic and Arif, his chief aide, was appointed deputy prime minister, interior minister, and deputy commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

Almost immediately however, tensions rose between the pan-Arabist Arif and Iraqi nationalist Qasim who also had the support of the Iraqi Communist Party. The former supported a union with the United Arab Republic (UAR) — composed of Egypt and Syria — under president Gamal Abdel Nasser, but the latter opposed merging with the UAR. As a result, the two leaders engaged in a power struggle, ending in Qasim prevailing and the removal of Arif from his positions on 12 September. He was appointed the low-ranking post of ambassador to Bonn. Arif refused to take up the post and upon returning to Baghdad on 4 November, he was promptly arrested for plotting against the state. He was sentenced to death along with Rashid Ali al-Gaylani in February 1959. Qasim had him released in November 1961.

== President of Iraq ==
Qasim was overthrown on 8 February 1963, by a coalition of Ba&#x27;athists, army units, and other pan-Arabist groups. Arif had previously been selected as the leader of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council and after the coup he was elected president of Iraq due to his popularity. Qasim pleaded with Arif to be exiled instead of executed and reminded Arif that he had commuted his death sentence two years before. Nonetheless, Arif demanded that Qasim swear to the Qur&#x27;an that it was he, Arif, who had been the real leader of the 1958 coup. Qasim refused and was consequently executed.

Arif was a Pan-Arabist who advocated for Arab-Islamic nationalism, which caused conflicts between him and Qasim. He had criticized Qasim for excluding Iraq from Pan-Arab efforts and pursuing an Iraqi policy instead. However, Arif also held fairly liberal views on Kurds.

Although he was chosen as president, more power was held by the Ba&#x27;athist secretary general Ali Salih al-Sa&#x27;di and Ba&#x27;athist prime minister, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr. Following a Ba&#x27;athist-led coup in Syria in March 1963, Arif entered his country into unification talks with Syria and Egypt (which had split from the UAR in 1961). After a falling out with Nasser in July, the Ba&#x27;athist government of Iraq removed all non-Ba&#x27;athist members from the cabinet, despite Arif&#x27;s support for Nasser. On 18 November Arif, with the support of disaffected elements in the military, took advantage of a split between the Ba&#x27;ath—which weakened the party—and ousted their members from the government. Arif formed a new cabinet, retaining a few Ba&#x27;athists, but mostly made up of Nasserist army officers and technocrats. He maintained his presidency and appointed himself chief-of-staff. A month later he handed the latter post to his brother General Abdul Rahman Arif, and the premiership to his confidant Lieutenant-General Tahir Yahya. In the fall of 1964, the Ba&#x27;ath attempted to depose Arif but failed when their plot was unveiled. Arif had the conspirators, including Saddam Hussein, arrested.

On 26 May 1964, Arif established the Joint Presidency Council with Egypt. On 14 July the anniversary of the revolution, he declared the establishment of the Arab Socialist Union (ASU) of Iraq, commending it as the &quot;threshold of the building of the unity of the Arab nation under Arab socialism.&quot; It was nearly identical in structure the ASU of Egypt and like in Egypt, many of the Arab nationalist parties were dissolved and absorbed by the ASU. Also, all banks and over thirty major Iraqi businesses were nationalised. Arif undertook these measures in an effort to bring Iraq closer with Egypt to help foster unity and on 20 December plans for union were announced. Despite this, in July 1965, the Nasserist ministers resigned from the Iraqi cabinet.

President Arif played a major role in encouraging construction in Iraq and developing the country&#x27;s infrastructure.

== Death ==
On 13 April 1966, Arif was killed in the crash of Iraqi Air Force de Havilland DH.104 Dove 1, &quot;RF392&quot;, in southern Iraq about 10 kilometres from Basra Airport, and was replaced as president by his brother Abdul Rahman. Reports at the time said Arif had died in a helicopter accident. Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz became acting president for three days, and a power struggle for the presidency occurred. In the first meeting of the Defense Council and cabinet to elect a president, Al-Bazzaz needed a two-thirds majority to win the presidency. Al-Bazzaz was unsuccessful, and Abdul Rahman Arif was elected president. He was viewed by army officers as weaker and easier to manipulate than his brother.

== Family ==
On 13 December 2004, Arif&#x27;s daughter, Sana Abdul Salam, and her husband, Wamith Abdul Razzak Said Alkadiry, were shot dead in their home in Baghdad by unknown assailants. Rafal Alkadiry, their 22-year-old son, was kidnapped, and later killed.

<text>In probability and statistics, an exponential family is a parametric set of probability distributions of a certain form, specified below. This special form is chosen for mathematical convenience, including the enabling of the user to calculate expectations, covariances using differentiation based on some useful algebraic properties, as well as for generality, as exponential families are in a sense very natural sets of distributions to consider. The term exponential class is sometimes used in place of &quot;exponential family&quot;, or the older term Koopman–Darmois family.
Sometimes loosely referred to as &quot;the&quot; exponential family, this class of distributions is distinct because they all possess a variety of desirable properties, most importantly the existence of a sufficient statistic.

The concept of exponential families is credited to E. J. G. Pitman, G. Darmois, and B. O. Koopman in 1935–1936. Exponential families of distributions provide a general framework for selecting a possible alternative parameterisation of a parametric family of distributions, in terms of natural parameters, and for defining useful sample statistics, called the natural sufficient statistics of the family.

== Nomenclature difficulty ==
The terms &quot;distribution&quot; and &quot;family&quot; are often used loosely: Specifically, &quot;an&quot; exponential family is a &quot;set&quot; of distributions, where the specific distribution varies with the parameter; however, a parametric &quot;family&quot; of distributions is often referred to as &quot;&quot;a&quot; distribution&quot; (like &quot;the normal distribution&quot;, meaning &quot;the family of normal distributions&quot;), and the set of all exponential families is sometimes loosely referred to as &quot;the&quot; exponential family. 

== Definition ==
Most of the commonly used distributions form an exponential family or subset of an exponential family, listed in the subsection below. The subsections following it are a sequence of increasingly more general mathematical definitions of an exponential family. A casual reader may wish to restrict attention to the first and simplest definition, which corresponds to a single-parameter family of discrete or continuous probability distributions.

===Examples of exponential family distributions===
Exponential families include many of the most common distributions. Among many others, exponential families includes the following:

*normal
*exponential
*gamma
*chi-squared
*beta
*Dirichlet
*Bernoulli
*categorical
*Poisson
*Wishart
*inverse Wishart
*geometric
A number of common distributions are exponential families, but only when certain parameters are fixed and known. For example:
*binomial (with fixed number of trials)
*multinomial (with fixed number of trials)
*negative binomial (with fixed number of failures)
Note that in each case, the parameters which must be fixed are those that set a limit on the range of values that can possibly be observed.

Examples of common distributions that are &quot;not&quot; exponential families are Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;, most mixture distributions, and even the family of uniform distributions when the bounds are not fixed. See the section below on examples for more discussion.

=== Scalar parameter ===
The value of formula_1 is called the &quot;parameter&quot; of the family.

A single-parameter exponential family is a set of probability distributions whose probability density function (or probability mass function, for the case of a discrete distribution) can be expressed in the form

: formula_2

where formula_3 formula_4 formula_5 and formula_6 are known functions. The function formula_7 must be non-negative.

An alternative, equivalent form often given is

: formula_8

or equivalently

: formula_9

In terms of log probability,
: formula_10

Note that formula_11 and formula_12

==== Support must be independent of ====
Importantly, the &quot;support&quot; of formula_13 (all the possible formula_14 values for which formula_13 is greater than formula_16) is required to &quot;not&quot; depend on formula_17
This requirement can be used to exclude a parametric family distribution from being an exponential family.

For example: The Pareto distribution has a pdf which is defined for formula_18 (the minimum value, formula_19 being the scale parameter) and its support, therefore, has a lower limit of formula_20 Since the support of formula_21 is dependent on the value of the parameter, the family of Pareto distributions does not form an exponential family of distributions (at least when formula_22 is unknown).

Another example: Bernoulli-type distributions – binomial, negative binomial, geometric distribution, and similar – can only be included in the exponential class if the number of Bernoulli trials, formula_23 is treated as a fixed constant – excluded from the free parameter(s) formula_1 – since the allowed number of trials sets the limits for the number of &quot;successes&quot; or &quot;failures&quot; that can be observed in a set of trials.

====Vector valued and ====
Often formula_14 is a vector of measurements, in which case formula_26 may be a function from the space of possible values of formula_14 to the real numbers.

More generally, formula_28 and formula_26 can each be vector-valued such that formula_30 is real-valued. However, see the discussion below on vector parameters, regarding the exponential family.

==== Canonical formulation ====
If formula_31 then the exponential family is said to be in &quot;canonical form&quot;. By defining a transformed parameter formula_32 it is always possible to convert an exponential family to canonical form. The canonical form is non-unique, since formula_28 can be multiplied by any nonzero constant, provided that formula_26 is multiplied by that constant&#x27;s reciprocal, or a constant &quot;c&quot; can be added to formula_28 and formula_7 multiplied by formula_37 to offset it. In the special case that formula_38 and formula_39 then the family is called a &quot;natural exponential family&quot;.

Even when formula_14 is a scalar, and there is only a single parameter, the functions formula_28 and formula_26 can still be vectors, as described below.

The function formula_43 or equivalently formula_44 is automatically determined once the other functions have been chosen, since it must assume a form that causes the distribution to be normalized (sum or integrate to one over the entire domain). Furthermore, both of these functions can always be written as functions of formula_45 even when formula_28 is not a one-to-one function, i.e. two or more different values of formula_1 map to the same value of formula_5 and hence formula_28 cannot be inverted. In such a case, all values of formula_1 mapping to the same formula_28 will also have the same value for formula_6 and formula_53

=== Factorization of the variables involved ===
What is important to note, and what characterizes all exponential family variants, is that the parameter(s) and the observation variable(s) must factorize (can be separated into products each of which involves only one type of variable), either directly or within either part (the base or exponent) of an exponentiation operation. Generally, this means that all of the factors constituting the density or mass function must be of one of the following forms:

: formula_54

where formula_55 and formula_56 are arbitrary functions of formula_57 the observed statistical variable; formula_58 and formula_59 are arbitrary functions of formula_60 the fixed parameters defining the shape of the distribution; and formula_61 is any arbitrary constant expression (i.e. a number or an expression that does not change with either formula_14 or formula_1).

There are further restrictions on how many such factors can occur. For example, the two expressions:

: formula_64

are the same, i.e. a product of two &quot;allowed&quot; factors. However, when rewritten into the factorized form,

: formula_65

it can be seen that it cannot be expressed in the required form. (However, a form of this sort is a member of a &quot;curved exponential family&quot;, which allows multiple factorized terms in the exponent.)

To see why an expression of the form

: formula_66

qualifies,
: formula_67

and hence factorizes inside of the exponent. Similarly,

: formula_68

and again factorizes inside of the exponent.

A factor consisting of a sum where both types of variables are involved (e.g. a factor of the form formula_69) cannot be factorized in this fashion (except in some cases where occurring directly in an exponent); this is why, for example, the Cauchy distribution and Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot; distribution are not exponential families.

=== Vector parameter ===
The definition in terms of one &quot;real-number&quot; parameter can be extended to one &quot;real-vector&quot; parameter

: formula_70

A family of distributions is said to belong to a vector exponential family if the probability density function (or probability mass function, for discrete distributions) can be written as

: formula_71

or in a more compact form,

: formula_72

This form writes the sum as a dot product of vector-valued functions formula_73 and formula_74.

An alternative, equivalent form often seen is

:formula_75

As in the scalar valued case, the exponential family is said to be in &quot;canonical form&quot; if

:formula_76

A vector exponential family is said to be &quot;curved&quot; if the dimension of

: formula_77

is less than the dimension of the vector

: formula_78

That is, if the &quot;dimension&quot;, , of the parameter vector is less than the &quot;number of functions&quot;, , of the parameter vector in the above representation of the probability density function. Most common distributions in the exponential family are &quot;not&quot; curved, and many algorithms designed to work with any exponential family implicitly or explicitly assume that the distribution is not curved.

Just as in the case of a scalar-valued parameter, the function formula_79 or equivalently formula_80 is automatically determined by the normalization constraint, once the other functions have been chosen. Even if formula_81 is not one-to-one, functions formula_82 and formula_83 can be defined by requiring that the distribution is normalized for each value of the natural parameter formula_84. This yields the &quot;canonical form&quot;

: formula_85

or equivalently

: formula_86

The above forms may sometimes be seen with formula_87 in place of formula_88. These are exactly equivalent formulations, merely using different notation for the dot product.

=== Vector parameter, vector variable ===
The vector-parameter form over a single scalar-valued random variable can be trivially expanded to cover a joint distribution over a vector of random variables. The resulting distribution is simply the same as the above distribution for a scalar-valued random variable with each occurrence of the scalar replaced by the vector

:formula_89

The dimensions of the random variable need not match the dimension of the parameter vector, nor (in the case of a curved exponential function) the dimension of the natural parameter formula_84 and sufficient statistic  .

The distribution in this case is written as

: formula_91

Or more compactly as

: formula_92

Or alternatively as

: formula_93

=== Measure-theoretic formulation ===
We use cumulative distribution functions (CDF) in order to encompass both discrete and continuous distributions.

Suppose is a non-decreasing function of a real variable. Then Lebesgue–Stieltjes integrals with respect to formula_94 are integrals with respect to the &quot;reference measure&quot; of the exponential family generated by  .

Any member of that exponential family has cumulative distribution function

:formula_95

 is a Lebesgue–Stieltjes integrator for the reference measure. When the reference measure is finite, it can be normalized and is actually the cumulative distribution function of a probability distribution. If is absolutely continuous with a density formula_96 with respect to a reference measure formula_97 (typically Lebesgue measure), one can write formula_98.
In this case, is also absolutely continuous and can be written formula_99 so the formulas reduce to that of the previous paragraphs. If is discrete, then is a step function (with steps on the support of ).

Alternatively, we can write the probability measure directly as

:formula_100

for some reference measure formula_101.

== Interpretation ==
In the definitions above, the functions , , and were arbitrary. However, these functions have important interpretations in the resulting probability distribution.

* is a &quot;sufficient statistic&quot; of the distribution. For exponential families, the sufficient statistic is a function of the data that holds all information the data provides with regard to the unknown parameter values. This means that, for any data sets formula_102 and formula_103, the likelihood ratio is the same, that is formula_104 if . This is true even if and are not equal to each other. The dimension of equals the number of parameters of and encompasses all of the information regarding the data related to the parameter . The sufficient statistic of a set of independent identically distributed data observations is simply the sum of individual sufficient statistics, and encapsulates all the information needed to describe the posterior distribution of the parameters, given the data (and hence to derive any desired estimate of the parameters). (This important property is discussed further below.)
* is called the &quot;natural parameter&quot;. The set of values of for which the function formula_105 is integrable is called the &quot;natural parameter space&quot;. It can be shown that the natural parameter space is always convex.
* is called the &quot;log-partition function&quot; because it is the logarithm of a normalization factor, without which formula_106 would not be a probability distribution:
::formula_107
The function is important in its own right, because the mean, variance and other moments of the sufficient statistic can be derived simply by differentiating . For example, because is one of the components of the sufficient statistic of the gamma distribution, formula_108 can be easily determined for this distribution using . Technically, this is true because 
::formula_109 
is the cumulant generating function of the sufficient statistic.

== Properties ==
Exponential families have a large number of properties that make them extremely useful for statistical analysis. In many cases, it can be shown that &quot;only&quot; exponential families have these properties. Examples:
*Exponential families are the only families with sufficient statistics that can summarize arbitrary amounts of independent identically distributed data using a fixed number of values. (Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem)
*Exponential families have conjugate priors, an important property in Bayesian statistics.
*The posterior predictive distribution of an exponential-family random variable with a conjugate prior can always be written in closed form (provided that the normalizing factor of the exponential-family distribution can itself be written in closed form).
*In the mean-field approximation in variational Bayes (used for approximating the posterior distribution in large Bayesian networks), the best approximating posterior distribution of an exponential-family node (a node is a random variable in the context of Bayesian networks) with a conjugate prior is in the same family as the node.
Given an exponential family defined by formula_110, where formula_111 is the parameter space, such that formula_112. Then

* If formula_111 has nonempty interior in formula_114, then given any IID samples formula_115, the statistic formula_116 is a complete statistic for formula_117.
* formula_118 is a minimal statistic for formula_117 iff for all formula_120, and formula_121 in the support of formula_122, if formula_123, then formula_124 or formula_125.

== Examples ==
It is critical, when considering the examples in this section, to remember the discussion above about what it means to say that a &quot;distribution&quot; is an exponential family, and in particular to keep in mind that the set of parameters that are allowed to vary is critical in determining whether a &quot;distribution&quot; is or is not an exponential family.

The normal, exponential, log-normal, gamma, chi-squared, beta, Dirichlet, Bernoulli, categorical, Poisson, geometric, inverse Gaussian, ALAAM, von Mises, and von Mises-Fisher distributions are all exponential families.

Some distributions are exponential families only if some of their parameters are held fixed. The family of Pareto distributions with a fixed minimum bound &quot;x&quot;m form an exponential family. The families of binomial and multinomial distributions with fixed number of trials &quot;n&quot; but unknown probability parameter(s) are exponential families. The family of negative binomial distributions with fixed number of failures (a.k.a. stopping-time parameter) &quot;r&quot; is an exponential family. However, when any of the above-mentioned fixed parameters are allowed to vary, the resulting family is not an exponential family.

As mentioned above, as a general rule, the support of an exponential family must remain the same across all parameter settings in the family. This is why the above cases (e.g. binomial with varying number of trials, Pareto with varying minimum bound) are not exponential families — in all of the cases, the parameter in question affects the support (particularly, changing the minimum or maximum possible value). For similar reasons, neither the discrete uniform distribution nor continuous uniform distribution are exponential families as one or both bounds vary.

The Weibull distribution with fixed shape parameter &quot;k&quot; is an exponential family. Unlike in the previous examples, the shape parameter does not affect the support; the fact that allowing it to vary makes the Weibull non-exponential is due rather to the particular form of the Weibull&#x27;s probability density function (&quot;k&quot; appears in the exponent of an exponent).

In general, distributions that result from a finite or infinite mixture of other distributions, e.g. mixture model densities and compound probability distributions, are &quot;not&quot; exponential families. Examples are typical Gaussian mixture models as well as many heavy-tailed distributions that result from compounding (i.e. infinitely mixing) a distribution with a prior distribution over one of its parameters, e.g. the Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution (compounding a normal distribution over a gamma-distributed precision prior), and the beta-binomial and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions. Other examples of distributions that are not exponential families are the F-distribution, Cauchy distribution, hypergeometric distribution and logistic distribution.

Following are some detailed examples of the representation of some useful distribution as exponential families.

=== Normal distribution: unknown mean, known variance ===
As a first example, consider a random variable distributed normally with unknown mean &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;known&quot; variance &quot;σ&quot;2. The probability density function is then

:formula_126

This is a single-parameter exponential family, as can be seen by setting

:formula_127

If &quot;σ&quot; = 1 this is in canonical form, as then &quot;η&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;) = &quot;μ&quot;.

=== Normal distribution: unknown mean and unknown variance ===
Next, consider the case of a normal distribution with unknown mean and unknown variance. The probability density function is then

:formula_128

This is an exponential family which can be written in canonical form by defining

:formula_129

=== Binomial distribution ===
As an example of a discrete exponential family, consider the binomial distribution with &quot;known&quot; number of trials &quot;n&quot;. The probability mass function for this distribution is
:formula_130
This can equivalently be written as
:formula_131
which shows that the binomial distribution is an exponential family, whose natural parameter is
:formula_132
This function of &quot;p&quot; is known as logit.

== Table of distributions ==
The following table shows how to rewrite a number of common distributions as exponential-family distributions with natural parameters. Refer to the flashcards for main exponential families.

For a scalar variable and scalar parameter, the form is as follows:

:formula_133

For a scalar variable and vector parameter:

:formula_134
:formula_135

For a vector variable and vector parameter:

:formula_136

The above formulas choose the functional form of the exponential-family with a log-partition function formula_137. The reason for this is so that the moments of the sufficient statistics can be calculated easily, simply by differentiating this function. Alternative forms involve either parameterizing this function in terms of the normal parameter formula_138 instead of the natural parameter, and/or using a factor formula_139 outside of the exponential. The relation between the latter and the former is:
:formula_140 
:formula_141 
To convert between the representations involving the two types of parameter, use the formulas below for writing one type of parameter in terms of the other.

:* The Iverson bracket is a generalization of the discrete delta-function: If the bracketed expression is true, the bracket has value 1; if the enclosed statement is false, the Iverson bracket is zero. There are many variant notations, e.g. wavey brackets: is equivalent to the notation used above.

The three variants of the categorical distribution and multinomial distribution are due to the fact that the parameters formula_142 are constrained, such that

:formula_143

Thus, there are only formula_144 independent parameters.
*Variant 1 uses formula_145 natural parameters with a simple relation between the standard and natural parameters; however, only formula_144 of the natural parameters are independent, and the set of formula_145 natural parameters is nonidentifiable. The constraint on the usual parameters translates to a similar constraint on the natural parameters.
*Variant 2 demonstrates the fact that the entire set of natural parameters is nonidentifiable: Adding any constant value to the natural parameters has no effect on the resulting distribution. However, by using the constraint on the natural parameters, the formula for the normal parameters in terms of the natural parameters can be written in a way that is independent on the constant that is added.
*Variant 3 shows how to make the parameters identifiable in a convenient way by setting formula_148 This effectively &quot;pivots&quot; around formula_149 and causes the last natural parameter to have the constant value of 0. All the remaining formulas are written in a way that does not access formula_150, so that effectively the model has only formula_144 parameters, both of the usual and natural kind.
Variants 1 and 2 are not actually standard exponential families at all. Rather they are &quot;curved exponential families&quot;, i.e. there are formula_144 independent parameters embedded in a formula_145-dimensional parameter space. Many of the standard results for exponential families do not apply to curved exponential families. An example is the log-partition function formula_154, which has the value of 0 in the curved cases. In standard exponential families, the derivatives of this function correspond to the moments (more technically, the cumulants) of the sufficient statistics, e.g. the mean and variance. However, a value of 0 suggests that the mean and variance of all the sufficient statistics are uniformly 0, whereas in fact the mean of the formula_155th sufficient statistic should be formula_156. (This does emerge correctly when using the form of formula_154 shown in variant 3.)

== Moments and cumulants of the sufficient statistic ==

=== Normalization of the distribution ===

We start with the normalization of the probability distribution. In general, any non-negative function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) that serves as the kernel of a probability distribution (the part encoding all dependence on &quot;x&quot;) can be made into a proper distribution by normalizing: i.e.

:formula_158

where

:formula_159

The factor &quot;Z&quot; is sometimes termed the &quot;normalizer&quot; or &quot;partition function&quot;, based on an analogy to statistical physics.

In the case of an exponential family where 
:formula_160

the kernel is
:formula_161
and the partition function is
:formula_162

Since the distribution must be normalized, we have

:formula_163

In other words,
:formula_164
or equivalently
:formula_165

This justifies calling &quot;A&quot; the &quot;log-normalizer&quot; or &quot;log-partition function&quot;.

=== Moment-generating function of the sufficient statistic ===
Now, the moment-generating function of &quot;T&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is

:formula_166

proving the earlier statement that

:formula_167

is the cumulant generating function for &quot;T&quot;.

An important subclass of exponential families are the natural exponential families, which have a similar form for the moment-generating function for the distribution of &quot;x&quot;.

==== Differential identities for cumulants ====
In particular, using the properties of the cumulant generating function,

:formula_168

and

:formula_169

The first two raw moments and all mixed second moments can be recovered from these two identities. Higher-order moments and cumulants are obtained by higher derivatives. This technique is often useful when &quot;T&quot; is a complicated function of the data, whose moments are difficult to calculate by integration.

Another way to see this that does not rely on the theory of cumulants is to begin from the fact that the distribution of an exponential family must be normalized, and differentiate. We illustrate using the simple case of a one-dimensional parameter, but an analogous derivation holds more generally.

In the one-dimensional case, we have
:formula_170

This must be normalized, so

:formula_171

Take the derivative of both sides with respect to &quot;η&quot;:

:formula_172

Therefore,
:formula_173

==== Example 1 ====
As an introductory example, consider the gamma distribution, whose distribution is defined by

:formula_174

Referring to the above table, we can see that the natural parameter is given by

:formula_175
:formula_176

the reverse substitutions are

:formula_177
:formula_178

the sufficient statistics are formula_179 and the log-partition function is

:formula_180

We can find the mean of the sufficient statistics as follows. First, for &quot;η&quot;1:

:formula_181

Where formula_182 is the digamma function (derivative of log gamma), and we used the reverse substitutions in the last step.

Now, for &quot;η&quot;2:

:formula_183

again making the reverse substitution in the last step.

To compute the variance of &quot;x&quot;, we just differentiate again:

:formula_184

All of these calculations can be done using integration, making use of various properties of the gamma function, but this requires significantly more work.

==== Example 2 ====
As another example consider a real valued random variable &quot;X&quot; with density

:formula_185

indexed by shape parameter formula_186 (this is called the skew-logistic distribution). The density can be rewritten as

:formula_187

Notice this is an exponential family with natural parameter

:formula_188

sufficient statistic

:formula_189

and log-partition function

:formula_190

So using the first identity,

:formula_191

and using the second identity

:formula_192

This example illustrates a case where using this method is very simple, but the direct calculation would be nearly impossible.

==== Example 3 ====
The final example is one where integration would be extremely difficult. This is the case of the Wishart distribution, which is defined over matrices. Even taking derivatives is a bit tricky, as it involves matrix calculus, but the respective identities are listed in that article.

From the above table, we can see that the natural parameter is given by

: formula_193
: formula_194

the reverse substitutions are

: formula_195
: formula_196

and the sufficient statistics are formula_197

The log-partition function is written in various forms in the table, to facilitate differentiation and back-substitution. We use the following forms:

: formula_198
: formula_199

; Expectation of X (associated with η1)
To differentiate with respect to η1, we need the following matrix calculus identity:

: formula_200

Then:

: formula_201

The last line uses the fact that V is symmetric, and therefore it is the same when transposed.

;Expectation of log |X| (associated with &quot;η&quot;2)
Now, for &quot;η&quot;2, we first need to expand the part of the log-partition function that involves the multivariate gamma function:

: formula_202

We also need the digamma function:

: formula_203

Then:

: formula_204

This latter formula is listed in the Wishart distribution article. Both of these expectations are needed when deriving the variational Bayes update equations in a Bayes network involving a Wishart distribution (which is the conjugate prior of the multivariate normal distribution).

Computing these formulas using integration would be much more difficult. The first one, for example, would require matrix integration.

== Entropy ==
=== Relative entropy ===
The relative entropy (Kullback–Leibler divergence, KL divergence) of two distributions in an exponential family has a simple expression as the Bregman divergence between the natural parameters with respect to the log-normalizer. The relative entropy is defined in terms of an integral, while the Bregman divergence is defined in terms of a derivative and inner product, and thus is easier to calculate and has a closed-form expression (assuming the derivative has a closed-form expression). Further, the Bregman divergence in terms of the natural parameters and the log-normalizer equals the Bregman divergence of the dual parameters (expectation parameters), in the opposite order, for the convex conjugate function.

Fixing an exponential family with log-normalizer (with convex conjugate ), writing formula_205 for the distribution in this family corresponding a fixed value of the natural parameter (writing for another value, and with for the corresponding dual expectation/moment parameters), writing for the KL divergence, and for the Bregman divergence, the divergences are related as:
:formula_206

The KL divergence is conventionally written with respect to the &quot;first&quot; parameter, while the Bregman divergence is conventionally written with respect to the &quot;second&quot; parameter, and thus this can be read as &quot;the relative entropy is equal to the Bregman divergence defined by the log-normalizer on the swapped natural parameters&quot;, or equivalently as &quot;equal to the Bregman divergence defined by the dual to the log-normalizer on the expectation parameters&quot;.

=== Maximum-entropy derivation ===
Exponential families arise naturally as the answer to the following question: what is the maximum-entropy distribution consistent with given constraints on expected values?

The information entropy of a probability distribution &quot;dF&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) can only be computed with respect to some other probability distribution (or, more generally, a positive measure), and both measures must be mutually absolutely continuous. Accordingly, we need to pick a &quot;reference measure&quot; &quot;dH&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) with the same support as &quot;dF&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

The entropy of &quot;dF&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) relative to &quot;dH&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is

:formula_207

or

:formula_208

where &quot;dF&quot;/&quot;dH&quot; and &quot;dH&quot;/&quot;dF&quot; are Radon–Nikodym derivatives. The ordinary definition of entropy for a discrete distribution supported on a set &quot;I&quot;, namely

:formula_209

&quot;assumes&quot;, though this is seldom pointed out, that &quot;dH&quot; is chosen to be the counting measure on &quot;I&quot;.

Consider now a collection of observable quantities (random variables) &quot;Ti&quot;. The probability distribution &quot;dF&quot; whose entropy with respect to &quot;dH&quot; is greatest, subject to the conditions that the expected value of &quot;Ti&quot; be equal to &quot;ti&quot;, is an exponential family with &quot;dH&quot; as reference measure and (&quot;T&quot;1, ..., &quot;Tn&quot;) as sufficient statistic.

The derivation is a simple variational calculation using Lagrange multipliers. Normalization is imposed by letting &quot;T&quot;0 = 1 be one of the constraints. The natural parameters of the distribution are the Lagrange multipliers, and the normalization factor is the Lagrange multiplier associated to &quot;T&quot;0.

For examples of such derivations, see Maximum entropy probability distribution.

== Role in statistics ==
=== Classical estimation: sufficiency ===
According to the Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem, among families of probability distributions whose domain does not vary with the parameter being estimated, only in exponential families is there a sufficient statistic whose dimension remains bounded as sample size increases.

Less tersely, suppose &quot;Xk&quot;, (where &quot;k&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... &quot;n&quot;) are independent, identically distributed random variables. Only if their distribution is one of the &quot;exponential family&quot; of distributions is there a sufficient statistic T(&quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;Xn&quot;) whose number of scalar components does not increase as the sample size &quot;n&quot; increases; the statistic T may be a vector or a single scalar number, but whatever it is, its size will neither grow nor shrink when more data are obtained.

As a counterexample if these conditions are relaxed, the family of uniform distributions (either discrete or continuous, with either or both bounds unknown) has a sufficient statistic, namely the sample maximum, sample minimum, and sample size, but does not form an exponential family, as the domain varies with the parameters.

=== Bayesian estimation: conjugate distributions ===
Exponential families are also important in Bayesian statistics. In Bayesian statistics a prior distribution is multiplied by a likelihood function and then normalised to produce a posterior distribution. In the case of a likelihood which belongs to an exponential family there exists a conjugate prior, which is often also in an exponential family. A conjugate prior π for the parameter formula_84 of an exponential family

: formula_211

is given by

: formula_212

or equivalently

:formula_213

where &quot;s&quot; is the dimension of formula_84 and formula_215 and formula_216 are hyperparameters (parameters controlling parameters). formula_217 corresponds to the effective number of observations that the prior distribution contributes, and formula_216 corresponds to the total amount that these pseudo-observations contribute to the sufficient statistic over all observations and pseudo-observations. formula_219 is a normalization constant that is automatically determined by the remaining functions and serves to ensure that the given function is a probability density function (i.e. it is normalized). formula_220 and equivalently formula_139 are the same functions as in the definition of the distribution over which π is the conjugate prior.

A conjugate prior is one which, when combined with the likelihood and normalised, produces a posterior distribution which is of the same type as the prior. For example, if one is estimating the success probability of a binomial distribution, then if one chooses to use a beta distribution as one&#x27;s prior, the posterior is another beta distribution. This makes the computation of the posterior particularly simple. Similarly, if one is estimating the parameter of a Poisson distribution the use of a gamma prior will lead to another gamma posterior. Conjugate priors are often very flexible and can be very convenient. However, if one&#x27;s belief about the likely value of the theta parameter of a binomial is represented by (say) a bimodal (two-humped) prior distribution, then this cannot be represented by a beta distribution. It can however be represented by using a mixture density as the prior, here a combination of two beta distributions; this is a form of hyperprior.

An arbitrary likelihood will not belong to an exponential family, and thus in general no conjugate prior exists. The posterior will then have to be computed by numerical methods.

To show that the above prior distribution is a conjugate prior, we can derive the posterior.

First, assume that the probability of a single observation follows an exponential family, parameterized using its natural parameter:

:formula_222

Then, for data formula_223, the likelihood is computed as follows:

:formula_224

Then, for the above conjugate prior:

: formula_225

We can then compute the posterior as follows:

:formula_226

The last line is the kernel of the posterior distribution, i.e.

: formula_227

This shows that the posterior has the same form as the prior.

The data X enters into this equation &quot;only&quot; in the expression

: formula_228

which is termed the sufficient statistic of the data. That is, the value of the sufficient statistic is sufficient to completely determine the posterior distribution. The actual data points themselves are not needed, and all sets of data points with the same sufficient statistic will have the same distribution. This is important because the dimension of the sufficient statistic does not grow with the data size — it has only as many components as the components of formula_84 (equivalently, the number of parameters of the distribution of a single data point).

The update equations are as follows:

: formula_230

This shows that the update equations can be written simply in terms of the number of data points and the sufficient statistic of the data. This can be seen clearly in the various examples of update equations shown in the conjugate prior page. Because of the way that the sufficient statistic is computed, it necessarily involves sums of components of the data (in some cases disguised as products or other forms — a product can be written in terms of a sum of logarithms). The cases where the update equations for particular distributions don&#x27;t exactly match the above forms are cases where the conjugate prior has been expressed using a different parameterization than the one that produces a conjugate prior of the above form — often specifically because the above form is defined over the natural parameter formula_84 while conjugate priors are usually defined over the actual parameter formula_232

=== Unbiased estimation ===
If the likelihood formula_233 is an exponential family, then the unbiased estimator of formula_234 is formula_235.

=== Hypothesis testing: uniformly most powerful tests ===
A one-parameter exponential family has a monotone non-decreasing likelihood ratio in the sufficient statistic &quot;T&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), provided that &quot;η&quot;(&quot;θ&quot;) is non-decreasing. As a consequence, there exists a uniformly most powerful test for testing the hypothesis &quot;H&quot;0: &quot;θ&quot; ≥ &quot;θ&quot;0 &quot;vs&quot;. &quot;H&quot;1: &quot;θ&quot; &lt; &quot;θ&quot;0.

=== Generalized linear models ===
Exponential families form the basis for the distribution functions used in generalized linear models (GLM), a class of model that encompasses many of the commonly used regression models in statistics. Examples include logistic regression using the binomial family and Poisson regression.

<text>Abdul Rahman Mohammed ʿArif al-Jumayli (; 14 April 191624 August 2007), better known as Abdul Rahman Arif, was an Iraqi military officer and politician who served as the third president of Iraq from 16 April 1966 to 17 July 1968. He was the older brother of the second president of Iraq, Abdul Salam Arif, whom he succeeded after his brother died in an airplane crash in 1966.

==Biography==
Abdul Rahman Arif was a career soldier in the Iraqi Army. He supported the military coup in 1958 that overthrew the monarchy, and also supported the coup that brought his brother, Abdul Salam, to power in 1963. His brother appointed him head of the army following the coup, and when the younger Arif died in an aircraft crash in April 1966, Prime Minister Abdul Rahman al-Bazzaz (&quot;a Western-oriented lawyer&quot; and the first civilian to head an Iraqi government since the 1958 revolution) became acting president. Three days later, al-Bazzaz was chosen to become president, but al-Bazzaz immediately relinquished the presidency to Abdul Rahman Arif. It is speculated that the transfer of power possibly occurred because the Iraqi military thought that Abdul Salam should be succeeded by his weak and easier to manipulate brother instead. Arif was appointed president by the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council. He continued his brother&#x27;s policies, but with a more nationalistic profile.

Like his brother Abdul Salam, he was an overt supporter of Egypt&#x27;s pan-Arabist president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Arif Abdul Razzak, another pro-Nasser Air Force Commander, attempted a coup d&#x27;état on Arif, d lightly bombed the Presidential Palace with Soviet MiG-17 jets, but the coup failed and he was arrested. It was his second failed coup attempt on the Arif government. President Arif went on TV to declare that on this occasion, Abdul Razzak would definitely be punished, only to then release him with a pardon.

His presidency was widely believed to be slack and indecisive. However, there are historical clues that he was not corrupt. The ill-advised law that he passed to absolve himself from paying income tax was probably an indication that he was not capable of getting wealth otherwise. Shortly after Arif came to power, the Iraqi military launched a major offensive against Kurdish rebels led by Mustafa Barzani in the First Iraqi–Kurdish War, pitting 40,000 Iraqi troops against Barzani&#x27;s 3,500-strong Peshmerga. Iranian and Israeli support contributed to a decisive Kurdish victory at the Battle of Mount Handren on 11 May 1966, where a battle plan devised by IDF military officer Zuri Sagy resulted in the killing of 1,400-2,000 Iraqi troops and the capture of hundreds more. Regime hard-liners were discredited by the debacle, and on 29 June 1966, Bazzaz announced a Twelve Point Plan for peace, which included &quot;administrative decentralisation&quot; in Iraqi Kurdistan and &quot;Kurdish representation in Parliament&quot;.

Throughout July 1966, Bazzaz began implementing the agreement by &quot;approving a massive rehabilitation program, lifting the economic blockade, releasing hundreds of Kurdish prisoners, removing Arab tribes from former Kurdish lands, and passing a general amnesty law&quot;, but opposition within the military forced Arif to dismiss Bazzaz in favour of General Naji Talib on 6 August 1966. Regardless, American officials in the Lyndon B. Johnson administration welcomed Iraq&#x27;s brief return to civilian rule under Bazzaz as well as Arif&#x27;s thwarting of Razzak&#x27;s second coup attempt on 30 June. Arif was considered &quot;one of the few forces of moderation&quot; in Iraq, having previously established a friendship with U.S. ambassador Robert Strong and making a number of friendly gestures to the United States between April 1966 and January 1967.

At Arif&#x27;s request, President Johnson met five Iraqi generals and Iraqi ambassador Nasir Hani in Washington, D.C., on 25 January 1967, reiterating his &quot;desire to build an ever closer relationship between [the] two governments.&quot; According to Johnson&#x27;s National Security Adviser, Walt Rostow, the U.S. National Security Council even contemplated welcoming Arif on a state visit to Washington, although this proposal was ultimately rejected due to concerns about the stability of Arif&#x27;s government.

Prior to the outbreak of the Six-Day War, Iraqi foreign minister Adnan Pachachi met with a number of U.S. officials to discuss the escalating Middle East crisis on 1 June, including U the S. ambassador to the UN Arthur Goldberg, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Eugene V. Rostow, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and President Johnson himself. The political atmosphere engendered by the costly Arab defeat prompted Iraq to break relations with the U.S. on 7 June, and ultimately ensured the collapse of Arif&#x27;s relatively moderate government.

On 17 July 1968, while Arif was sleeping, his own assistants along with members of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, overthrew him in a bloodless coup. As Arif and his brother had done in the 1963 coup against Qasim, the coalition declared victory once they had captured the radio station and the Ministry of Defence. It was accomplished when the defence minister, Hardan Al-Tikriti, phoned Arif informing him that he was no longer president. Arif was exiled to Turkey.

Arif returned to Iraq in 1979 when Saddam Hussein came to power, and largely stayed out of the public and political spotlight afterwards. He was allowed to leave the country once to undertake the Hajj. Arif left Iraq permanently after Hussein was removed from power by the U.S.-led invasion, and lived in Amman, Jordan from 2004. He died in Amman on 24 August 2007, He was married to Faika Abdul-Mageed Faris Alanee.

==Quotes==
* &quot;The existence of Israel is an error which we must put right. This is our opportunity to wipe out the disgrace which is Israel which has been with us since 1948. Our goal is clear – to wipe Israel off the map&quot;, speaking on the Radio, 1 June 1967
* &quot;I hope there will be stability and security in all parts of Iraq and neighbouring Arab countries&quot;, he said. &quot;I hope there will be national unity in Iraq by forgetting the past and looking for the future.&quot;

<doc id="339183" wikidata="Q11114344" url="?curid=339183" title="Points of the compass">
<text>The points of the compass are a set of horizontal, radially arrayed compass directions (or azimuths) used in navigation and cartography. A &quot;compass rose&quot; is primarily composed of four cardinal directions—north, east, south, and west—each separated by 90 degrees, and secondarily divided by four ordinal (intercardinal) directions—northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest—each located halfway between two cardinal directions. Some disciplines such as meteorology and navigation further divide the compass with additional azimuths. Within European tradition, a fully defined compass has 32 &quot;points&quot; (and any finer subdivisions are described in fractions of points). 

Compass points or compass directions are valuable in that they allow a user to refer to a specific azimuth in a colloquial fashion, without having to compute or remember degrees.

==Designations==
The names of the compass point directions follow these rules:

=== 8-wind compass rose ===
* The four cardinal directions are north (N), east (E), south (S), west (W), at 90° angles on the compass rose.
* The four intercardinal (or ordinal) directions are formed by bisecting the above, giving: northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW). In English and many other tongues, these are compound words. Different style guides for the four mandate spaces, dashes, or none.
** In Bulgarian, Catalan, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hungarian, Ido, Italian, Japanese (usually), Macedonian, Norwegian (both Bokmal and Nynorsk), Polish, Portuguese, Romansch, Russian, Serbian, Croatian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Welsh the part meaning north or south precedes the part meaning east or west.
** In Chinese, Vietnamese, Gaelic, and less commonly Japanese, the part meaning east or west precedes the other.
** In Estonian, Finnish, Breton, the &quot;Italianate system&quot;, and many South Asian and Southeast Asian languages such as Telugu, the intercardinals have distinct words.
* The eight &quot;principal winds&quot; (or &quot;main winds&quot;) are the set union of the cardinals and intercardinals. Taken in turn, each is 45° from the next. These form the &quot;8-wind compass rose&quot;, the rose at its usual basic level today.

=== 16-wind compass rose ===
* The eight &quot;half-winds&quot; are the direction points obtained by bisecting the angles between the principal winds. The half-winds are north-northeast (NNE), east-northeast (ENE), east-southeast (ESE), south-southeast (SSE), south-southwest (SSW), west-southwest (WSW), west-northwest (WNW), and north-northwest (NNW). The name of each half-wind is constructed by combining the names of the principal winds to either side, with the cardinal wind coming first and the intercardinal wind second.
* The eight principal winds and the eight half-winds together form the &quot;16-wind compass rose&quot;, with each compass point at a ° angle from its two neighbours.

=== 32-wind compass rose ===
* The sixteen &quot;quarter-winds&quot; are the direction points obtained by bisecting the angles between the points on the 16-wind compass rose (above). The quarter-winds are as follows.
:* in NE quadrant: north by east (NbE), northeast by north (NEbN), northeast by east (NEbE), and east by north (EbN);
:* in SE quadrant: east by south (EbS), southeast by east (SEbE), southeast by south (SEbS), and south by east (SbE);
:* in SW quadrant: south by west (SbW), southwest by south (SWbS), southwest by west (SWbW), and west by south (WbS);
:* in NW quadrant: west by north (WbN), northwest by west (NWbW), northwest by north (NWbN), and north by west (NbW)
* All of the points in the 16-wind compass rose plus the sixteen quarter-winds together form the &quot;32-wind compass rose&quot;.
* If breaking down for study/signalling the subcomponents are called the &quot;principal&quot; followed by the &quot;cardinal&quot; wind/direction. As a mnemonic (memory device), minds familiar encode the meaning of &quot;X by Y&quot; as &quot;one small measure &quot;from&quot; X &quot;towards&quot; Y&quot;. It can be noted such measure (&#x27;one point&#x27;) is °. So, for example, &quot;northeast by east&quot; means &quot;one quarter of the gap from NE towards E&quot;.

In summary, the 32-wind compass rose comes from the eight principal winds, eight half-winds, and sixteen quarter-winds combined, with each compass point at an ° angle from the next.

==== Half- and quarter-points ====
By the middle of the 18th century, the 32-point system had been further extended by using half- and quarter-points to give a total of 128 directions.
These fractional points are named by appending, for example, east, east, or east to the name of one of the 32 points. Each of the 96 fractional points can be named in two ways, depending on which of the two adjoining whole points is used, for example, NE is equivalent to NbEN. Either form is easily understood, but alternative conventions as to correct usage developed in different countries and organisations. &quot;It is the custom in the United States Navy to box &quot;from&quot; north and south &quot;toward&quot; east and west, with the exception that divisions adjacent to a cardinal or inter-cardinal point are always referred to that point.&quot; The Royal Navy used the additional &quot;rule that quarter points were never read from a point beginning and ending with the same letter.&quot;

Compass roses very rarely named the fractional points and only showed small, unlabelled markers as a guide for helmsmen.

==== Maritime Use ====
Prior to the modern three-figure method of describing directions (using the 360° of a circle), the 32-point compass was used for directions on most ships, especially among European crews. The smallest unit of measure recognized was &#x27;one point&#x27;, 1/32 of a circle, or °. In the mariner&#x27;s exercise of &quot;boxing the compass&quot;, all thirty-two points of the compass are named in clockwise order. This exercise became more significant as navigation improved and the half- and quarter-point system increased the number of directions to include in the &#x27;boxing&#x27;. Points remained the standard unit until switching to the three-figure degree method. These points were also used for relative measurement, so that an obstacle might be noted as &#x27;two points off the starboard bow&#x27;, meaning two points clockwise of straight ahead, ° This relative measurement may still be used in shorthand on modern ships, especially for handoffs between outgoing and incoming helmsmen, as the loss of granularity is less significant than the brevity and simplicity of the summary.

===128 compass directions===
The table below shows how each of the 128 directions are named. The first two columns give the number of points and degrees clockwise from north. The third gives the equivalent bearing to the nearest degree from north or south towards east or west. The &quot;CW&quot; column gives the fractional-point bearings increasing in the clockwise direction and &quot;CCW&quot; counterclockwise. The final three columns show three common naming conventions: No &quot;by&quot; avoids the use of &quot;by&quot; with fractional points. Colour coding shows whether each of the three naming systems matches the &quot;CW&quot; or &quot;CCW&quot; column.

== Traditional Mediterranean compass points ==
The traditional compass rose of eight winds (and its 16-wind and 32-wind derivatives) was invented by seafarers in the Mediterranean Sea during the Middle Ages (with no obvious connection to the twelve classical compass winds of the ancient Greeks and Romans). The traditional mariner&#x27;s wind names were expressed in Italian, or more precisely, the Italianate Mediterranean lingua franca common among sailors in the 13th and 14th centuries, which was principally composed of Genoese (Ligurian), mixed with Venetian, Sicilian, Provençal, Catalan, Greek, and Arabic terms from around the Mediterranean basin.
This Italianate patois was used to designate the names of the principal winds on the compass rose found in mariners&#x27; compasses and portolan charts of the 14th and 15th centuries. The traditional names of the eight principal winds are:
* (N) – &quot;Tramontana&quot;
* (NE) – &quot;Greco&quot; (or &quot;Bora&quot; in some Venetian sources)
* (E) – &quot;Levante&quot; (sometimes &quot;Oriente&quot;)
* (SE) – &quot;Scirocco&quot; (or &quot;Exaloc&quot; in Catalan)
* (S) – &quot;Ostro&quot; (or &quot;Mezzogiorno&quot; in Venetian)
* (SW) – &quot;Libeccio&quot; (or &quot;Garbino&quot;, &quot;Eissalot&quot; in Provençal)
* (W) – &quot;Ponente&quot; (or &quot;Zephyrus&quot; in Greek)
* (NW) – &quot;Maestro&quot; (or &quot;Mistral&quot; in Provençal)

Local spelling variations are far more numerous than listed, e.g. Tramutana, Gregale, Grecho, Sirocco, Xaloc, Lebeg, Libezo, Leveche, Mezzodi, Migjorn, Magistro, Mestre, etc. Traditional compass roses will typically have the initials T, G, L, S, O, L, P, and M on the main points. Portolan charts also colour-coded the compass winds: black for the eight principal winds, green for the eight half-winds, and red for the sixteen quarter-winds.

Each half-wind name is simply a combination of the two principal winds that it bisects, with the shortest name usually placed first, for example: NNE is &quot;Greco-Tramontana&quot;; ENE is &quot;Greco-Levante&quot;; SSE is &quot;Ostro-Scirocco&quot;, etc. The quarter winds are expressed with an Italian phrase, &quot;&quot;Quarto di &quot;X&quot; verso &quot;Y&quot; ( one quarter from X towards Y), or &quot;X &quot;al&quot; Y&quot; (X to Y) or &quot;X &quot;per&quot; Y&quot; (X by Y). There are no irregularities to trip over; the closest principal wind always comes first, the more distant one second, for example: north-by-east is &quot;&quot;Quarto di Tramontana verso Greco&quot;; and northeast-by-north is &quot;Quarto di Greco verso Tramontana&quot;&quot;.

The table below shows how the 32 compass points are named. Each point has an angular range of degrees where the azimuth &quot;midpoint&quot; is the horizontal angular direction (clockwise from north) of the given compass bearing; &quot;minimum&quot; is the lower (counterclockwise) angular limit of the compass point; and &quot;maximum&quot; is the upper (clockwise) angular limit of the compass point.

==Chinese compass points==
Navigation texts dating from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties in China use a 24-pointed compass with named directions. These are based on the twelve Earthly Branches, which also form the basis of the Chinese zodiac. When a single direction is specified, it may be prefaced by the character (meaning single) or .

Headings mid-way in-between are compounds as in English. For instance, refers to the direction halfway between point and point , or °. This technique is referred to as a double-needle () compass.

<text>Ben Nighthorse Campbell (born April 13, 1933) is a Native American politician and Air Force veteran who served in both chambers of the United States Congress; representing Colorado in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1987 to 1993 and in the U.S. Senate from 1993 to 2005. He serves as one of 44 members of the Council of Chiefs of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Tribe. During his time in office, he was the only Native American serving in Congress. He was the last Native American elected to the U.S. Senate until the 2022 election of Cherokee Markwayne Mullin.

Originally a member of the Democratic Party, Campbell switched to the Republican Party on March 3, 1995. Reelected to the Senate in 1998, Campbell announced in March 2004 that he would not run for a third term. His seat was won by Democrat Ken Salazar in the November 2004 election. Campbell later expressed interest in running for governor of Colorado in 2006, but on January 4, 2006, announced that he would not enter the race. He later became a lobbyist for the law and lobbying firm Holland &amp; Knight and afterward co-founded his own lobbying firm, Ben Nighthorse Consultants.

==Early life==
Campbell was born Benny Campbell in Auburn, California. His mother, Mary Vierra (Vieira), was a Portuguese immigrant who had come at age six with her mother to the U.S. through Ellis Island. According to Campbell, his maternal grandfather had entered the U.S. some time before. The Vierra family settled in the large Portuguese community near Sacramento. When Mary Vierra contracted tuberculosis in her youth, she was forced to convalesce at a nearby hospital, often for months at a time during treatment. It was there that she met a Native American patient, Albert Campbell, who was at the hospital for alcoholism treatment. Albert Campbell was of predominantly Northern Cheyenne descent but, according to Campbell biographer Herman Viola, spent much of his youth in Crow Agency boarding school and may have had some Pueblo Indian and Apache Indian ancestry as well. The couple married in 1929, and Ben Campbell was born in 1933.

During Campbell&#x27;s childhood, his father continued to have problems with alcoholism, often leaving the family for weeks and months at a time. His mother continued to have problems with tuberculosis, a highly contagious disease that limited the contact she could have with her children and continued to force her into the hospital for long periods. These problems led Ben and his sister, Alberta (who died in an apparent suicide at age 44), to spend much of their early lives in nearby Catholic orphanages. As a young man, Campbell was introduced to the Japanese martial art of judo by Japanese immigrant families he met while working in local agricultural fields.

==Military service and education==
Campbell attended Placer High School, dropping out in 1951 to join the U.S. Air Force. He was stationed in Korea during the Korean War as an air policeman; he left the Air Force in 1953 with the rank of Airman Second Class, as well as the Korean Service Medal and the Air Medal. While in the Air Force, Campbell obtained his GED and, after his discharge, used the G.I. Bill to attend San Jose State University, graduating in 1957 with a Bachelor of Arts in physical education and fine arts.

He is listed as &quot;Ben M. Campbell&quot; in his college records and records of his Olympic competition, but was given the name &quot;Nighthorse&quot; when he returned to the Northern Cheyenne reservation for his name-giving ceremony, as a member of his father&#x27;s family, Blackhorse.

== Career ==
=== Sports ===
In college, Campbell was a member of the San Jose State judo team, coached by future USA Olympic coach Yosh Uchida. While training for the Olympic Games, Campbell attended Meiji University in Tokyo, Japan, as a special research student from 1960 to 1964. The Meiji team was world-renowned and Campbell credited the preparation and discipline taught at Meiji for his 1961, 1962, and 1963 U.S. National titles and his gold medal in the 1963 Pan-American Games. In 1964, Campbell competed in judo at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. This made him the first Native American on the U.S. Olympic judo team. He suffered an injury and did not win a medal. He broke his ankle and was out for two years.

In the years after returning from the Olympic Games, Campbell worked as a deputy sheriff in Sacramento County, California, coached the U.S. national judo team, operated his own dojo in Sacramento, and taught high school (physical education and art classes). He and his wife also raised quarterhorses, including a Supreme Champion and AQHA Champion, Sailors Night. They bought a ranch near Ignacio, Colorado, on the Southern Ute reservation in 1978.

=== Jewelry ===
In Herman Viola&#x27;s book &quot;Ben Nighthorse Campbell: An American Warrior&quot;, Campbell recounts learning to make jewelry from his father and flattening silver dollars on train tracks for the materials. He also used techniques learned from sword makers in Japan and other non-traditional techniques to win over 200 national and international awards for jewelry design under the name Ben Nighthorse, and in the late 1970s was included in a feature article in &quot;Arizona Highways&quot; magazine about Native artists experimenting in the &quot;new look&quot; of Indian jewelry. Campbell has works on display with the Art of the Olympians organization.

=== Politics ===
Campbell was elected to the Colorado State Legislature as a Democrat in November 1982, and served two terms. He was voted one of the 10 Best Legislators by his colleagues in a 1986 &quot;Denver Post&quot; – News Center 4 survey.

====Congress====

In 1986, Campbell was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, defeating incumbent Mike Strang; he was reelected twice to this seat. In 1989, he authored the bill HR 2668 to establish the National Museum of the American Indian, which became PL 101–185.

====Senate====
The early 1990s marked a turning point in Campbell&#x27;s political career. In 1992, after Senator Tim Wirth announced his retirement, Campbell won a three-way Democratic primary against former three-term Governor Richard Lamm and Boulder County Commissioner Josie Heath, who had been the party&#x27;s nominee in 1990. During the primary campaign, Lamm supporters accused Heath of &quot;spoiling&quot; the election by splitting the vote of the party&#x27;s left wing. Heath&#x27;s campaign argued that it was Campbell who should not have run, because his voting record in Congress had been much more like that of a Republican. Campbell won the primary with 45% of the vote and defeated Republican State Senator Terry Considine in the general election. He was the first Native American elected to the United States Senate since Charles Curtis in the 1920s.

In March 1995, after two years in office, Campbell switched parties from Democratic to Republican in the wake of publicized disputes he had with the Colorado Democratic Party. Campbell said the last straw was the Senate&#x27;s defeat of the balanced-budget amendment, which he had championed since coming to Washington as a congressman in 1987. Others attributed the switch to personal hostility within the Democratic Party in Colorado.

In 1998, Campbell was reelected to the Senate by what was then the largest margin in Colorado history for a statewide race. After winning reelection, Campbell identified as a moderate Republican, saying that his reelection &quot;shows the moderate voices within the Republican Party are dominating&quot;. During President Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial, Campbell voted to convict Clinton on both articles of impeachment against him; in his final statement before the vote, he said: &quot;I took a solemn oath. Simply speaking, the president did too. And, so even though I like him personally, I find I can only vote one way. And that is guilty on both articles.&quot; Clinton was acquitted on both counts as neither received the necessary two-thirds vote of the senators present for conviction and removal from office.

In the 106th Congress, Campbell passed more public laws than any other member of Congress. During his tenure, he also became the first American Indian to chair the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. While in the Senate, Campbell voted to support the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision. He gradually became more conservative during his tenure, reversing his position on late-term abortions and voting for the Defense of Marriage Act. However, in 2004, he was one of six Republicans who voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, a constitutional amendment intended to ban same-sex marriage, on the grounds that it should be left to the states.

The Senate Ethics Committee investigated accusations that Campbell&#x27;s former chief of staff, Virginia Kontnik, inflated bonuses to an aide in 2002 so he could return the money to her. In subsequent interviews, Kontnik claimed that Campbell had approved the deal, which he denied.

After the prisoner abuse in Iraq by American military personnel and viewing unpublished abuse images alongside Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s Senate testimony, Campbell admonished the administration and military leadership: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how the hell these people got into our army.&quot;

On March 3, 2004, Campbell announced that he would not seek reelection due to health concerns, having recently been treated for prostate cancer and heartburn. He retired from office in January 2005, later saying of his decision: &quot;Somewhere along the line, I said &#x27;I&#x27;m not gonna die in this place. I want to do what I can, but I&#x27;m not dying here.&#x27;&quot; He is the last Republican to be elected to the Class 3 Senate seat from Colorado.

=== Post-congressional work ===

After his retirement, Campbell was a senior policy advisor at the firm of Holland and Knight, LLP, in Washington, D.C. In 2012, he left that firm to found Ben Nighthorse Consultants, a new lobbying firm. He also continues to design and craft his Ben Nighthorse line of American Indian jewelry.

Completed in 2011, Lake Nighthorse, a reservoir in southwestern Colorado, is named in his honor.

Campbell is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

In 2008, during the Cherokee freedmen controversy, Campbell authored a piece in &quot;The Hill&quot; criticizing the efforts of members of Congress attempting to terminate recognition of the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s government, and condemning the lawmakers&#x27; &quot;paternalistic efforts&quot;: 

Campbell endorsed then-Ohio governor John Kasich in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries.

In July 2016, Campbell spoke to Colorado Public Radio about regretting his support of the Iraq War: &quot;I have some misgivings about the way I voted but we were voting on the best information that we had at the time. I think if there was a weakness early on [it] is that the administration had several people in there really pushing for American involvement...In retrospect after seeing that there [were] no weapons of mass destruction and that we did not have really good intelligence on the ground to give us some guidance on how we should proceed, I now look back and think maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have voted the way I did.&quot;

In late 2018, Campbell joined several former Republican and Democratic senators in signing a letter supporting then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller&#x27;s investigation into alleged Russian collusion in the 2016 election. But he opposed the impeachment of President Donald Trump, defending Trump and calling it &quot;a waste of time&quot;. He also questioned why the Democrats would move to impeach knowing they would fail to convict in the Senate, saying, &quot;The cost of this and what it does to the country, it kind of tears the fabric of the nation apart.&quot;

In October 2020, Campbell appeared on Indian Country Today to speak on a variety of issues, including his party switch in 1995 and promoting free enterprise for Native Americans. He defended his switch to the Republican Party, and when asked whether its policies were better for Native peoples, he replied: &quot;The head of the Ku Klux Klan was not a Republican, it was a Democrat. It wasn&#x27;t a Republican who put 350,000 Japanese Americans in prison without any legal authority to do it, that was a Democrat, Roosevelt. And Andrew Jackson drove the Trail of Tears, of the Cherokees, the Chickasaws, the Choctaws, and many other tribes, taking their land by force. That wasn&#x27;t a Republican that did that. That was a Democrat… so when people say the Democrat Party has been more willing to help Native Americans, I dispute that. That&#x27;s not true.&quot; He went on to say how optimistic he was that more Native people were becoming involved and running for office, expressed support for Trump and his immigration policies, and voiced his concern with the rise of antifa.

In September 2021, Campbell endorsed Olympic athlete and Air Force veteran Eli Bremer in the Colorado Republican primary for the 2022 U.S. Senate race to challenge Democrat Michael Bennet. After Bremer lost the primary, Campbell endorsed Republican nominee Joe O&#x27;Dea in June 2022.

==Personal life==

In 1966, Campbell married the former Linda Price, a public school teacher who was a native of Colorado. They have two children and four grandchildren.

Linda Campbell was the sponsor of USS &quot;Mesa Verde&quot; (LPD 19) on January 15, 2005.

Lake Nighthorse in La Plata County, Colorado, is named in Campbell&#x27;s honor.

<text>Thomas Richard Carper (born January 23, 1947) is an American politician and former military officer who served from 2001 to 2025 as a United States senator from Delaware. A member of the Democratic Party, Carper served from 1983 to 1993 in the United States House of Representatives and from 1993 to 2001 as the 71st governor of Delaware.

A native of Beckley, West Virginia, Carper graduated from Ohio State University. Serving as a naval flight officer in the U.S. Navy from 1968 until 1973, he flew the P-3 Orion as a tactical coordinator and mission commander and saw active duty in the Vietnam War. After leaving the active duty Navy, he remained in the U.S. Naval Reserve for another 18 years and eventually retired with the rank of Captain (O-6). Upon receiving his MBA from the University of Delaware in 1975, Carper went to work for the state of Delaware in its economic development office. He was elected state treasurer, serving from 1977 to 1983 and leading the development of Delaware&#x27;s first cash management system.

Encouraged by local politicians, Carper successfully ran for Delaware&#x27;s only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982. He served five terms in the House, where he chaired the Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization. In 1992, he swapped positions with term-limited Republican Governor Mike Castle, and the two were easily elected to each other&#x27;s seats. Carper governed for two terms as a moderate, business-oriented New Democrat, following the lead of the two previous Republican governors.

Carper was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000, defeating Republican incumbent William Roth. He was reelected by landslides in 2006, 2012, and 2018. He served as one of four deputy Democratic whips, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Finance Committee. Carper was the senior senator in Delaware&#x27;s congressional delegation and the dean of the delegation. He was the last Vietnam War veteran to serve in the Senate.
==Early life and education==
Carper was born in Beckley, West Virginia, the son of Mary Jean (née Patton) and Wallace Richard Carper. He grew up in Danville, Virginia, and graduated from Whetstone High School in Columbus, Ohio. He then graduated from the Ohio State University in 1968, where he was a midshipman in the Naval ROTC and earned a degree in economics. At Ohio State, Carper became a member of the Beta Phi Chapter of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Carper earned an MBA from the University of Delaware in 1975.

== Early career ==
Serving as a Naval Flight Officer in the U.S. Navy from 1968 until 1973, he served three tours of duty in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. He remained in the U.S. Naval Reserve as a P-3 aircraft mission commander for another 18 years and retired with the rank of Captain (O-6).

While in college at the Ohio State University, Carper worked on the presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy. In Delaware, he worked as the campaign treasurer for University of Delaware professor James R. Soles in his unsuccessful 1974 bid for the U.S. House of Representatives.

After receiving his MBA degree in 1975, Carper went to work for the State of Delaware&#x27;s economic development office. In 1976, after developing good relationships with members of the state party leadership, he took out a $5,000 personal loan to fund his campaign to be Treasurer of Delaware. In the election, he defeated the favored Republican Party candidate, Theodore Jones. He served three terms, from January 18, 1977, through January 3, 1983, during which time he oversaw the development of Delaware&#x27;s first cash management system.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1982, U.S. Senator Joe Biden and other prominent Democrats convinced Carper to run for Delaware&#x27;s only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Incumbent Republican Thomas B. Evans Jr. sought reelection, and although he had been caught in a compromising &quot;association&quot; on a golfing trip with the lobbyist Paula Parkinson, was still considered a strong candidate.

Carper was considered well-positioned until three weeks before Election Day, when the &quot;New York Post&quot; published an article claiming that the &quot;dirtiest campaign in the country is being waged in tiny Delaware&quot;, which suggested that Carper had abused his wife and stepchildren. But when rumors spread that the story was &quot;planted&quot; by a supporter of Evans, Carper bounced back, with public opinion seeming to be that the allegations inappropriately exploited private issue. Carper and his wife both denied the allegations in 1982, but he later admitted to having slapped her. Carper defeated Evans.

Carper served five terms in the House. He won his second term in 1984, defeating Elise R. W. du Pont, the wife of retiring Governor Pete du Pont. He then easily defeated Republicans Thomas S. Neuberger in 1986, James P. Krapf in 1988 and Ralph O. Williams in 1990. He was a member of the U.S. House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and the U.S. House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. He chaired the House Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization. In these positions, he worked to allow banks into the securities business and to discourage the dumping of sludge into the ocean.

During his years in the House, Carper sought to gain better control of Delaware&#x27;s Democratic Party organization in hopes of someday becoming governor, focusing on heavily Democratic and populous New Castle County. Its Democratic organization was controlled by Eugene T. Reed, a former ironworker and longtime party boss who was then among several politicians in both parties implicated in illegal money raising practices. To address this corruption and rescue the Democratic Party&#x27;s reputation, Carper recruited Joseph E. Reardon, a DuPont Company chemist, as a candidate for New Castle County Democratic Party chairman. By early 1989, Reardon had been elected, replacing Reed at the head of a newly reformed party organization. In 1990, Carper defeated a Reed ally, Daniel D. Rappa, in the Democratic primary for U.S. representative.

==Governor of Delaware==

Republican Governor Michael Castle was term-limited and unable to seek reelection in 1992. The result was what became known as &quot;the Swap&quot;, with Castle seeking Carper&#x27;s seat in the U.S. House of Representatives and Carper seeking the governorship. Neither faced substantive opposition for either post.

Carper defeated Republican B. Gary Scott and was elected governor. He served two terms. Carper positioned himself as a moderate, business-oriented governor, emphasizing economic development and business recruitment. This included the prevention of the closure of the General Motors automobile operation near Newport, Delaware, and convincing pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to construct its new headquarters in the state.

Carper led an ongoing effort to reduce income tax rates, eliminate the marriage penalty and estate tax, cut the public utility tax, and eliminate the gross receipts tax for many small businesses. Delaware&#x27;s credit rating improved from among the worst in the nation to AAA. Carper also retained Castle&#x27;s standards-based education programs. Other programs included a fully funded Head Start program and a prescription-drug benefit for seniors.

Carper had high approval ratings, but was criticized by some old-line Democrats and union leaders.

As a tribute to Anne Marie Fahey, who had been a youth mentor before her death, then-Governor Carper also became a mentor, and began actively promoting mentoring programs throughout Delaware&#x27;s business community. As a result, by the end of his last term, Delaware held the highest per-capita ratio of youth mentors in the country. Carper also established the Delaware Mentoring Council to help sustain this legacy.
==United States Senate==

===Elections===

====2000====
Due to term limits, Carper had to retire as governor in 2000, and sought election to the U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican William Roth, declaring his candidacy in September 1999. Some had concerns about Roth&#x27;s age of 79, compared to Carper&#x27;s relative youth. Roth started the campaign with a 2-to-1 spending advantage, but Carper went into the final month with more than $1 million on hand. He defeated Roth, 56% to 44%. Roth received more votes than Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, suggesting that the strength of the Democratic turnout for the presidential election was key in Carper&#x27;s victory. Some commentators attributed Roth&#x27;s defeat to his age and health, as he collapsed twice during the campaign, once during a television interview and once during a campaign event.

====2006====

Carper sought reelection in 2006. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary and faced Republican nominee Jan C. Ting, a professor of law who had narrowly beaten airline pilot Michael D. Protack in the Republican primary. Carper was easily reelected, 67% to 27%.

====2012====

As the 2012 election cycle began, a Super PAC was created to oppose Carper&#x27;s reelection campaign. &quot;The Hill&quot; quoted Patrick Davis, the custodian of records and agent for Renew Delaware as saying, &quot;Tom Carper has served in the United States Senate for a long time and has been part of the downturn in our economy.&quot; &quot;Delaware Politics&quot; noted that the election would be costly for the Republican candidate and that Carper was heavily favored to win a third term. A Carper spokesperson, Emily Spain, was quoted in &quot;The Hill&quot; saying that Carper was successful in his previous campaigns &quot;because he works hard, takes nothing for granted, and puts the needs and interests of Delaware first.&quot; Carper won the Democratic primary with 88% of the vote and faced off against the only Republican candidate who filed for the race, businessman Kevin Wade. He was reelected with 66% of the vote.

====2018====

In 2018, Carper sought his fourth Senate term. His campaign contributors included DuPont, his third-largest contributor since 2013. Between 2013 and 2018, he received $2.1 million from political action committees. In the Democratic primary, Carper was challenged from the left by Kerri Evelyn Harris, a US Air Force Veteran, who, unlike Carper, supports a single-payer healthcare. Carper won the primary with roughly 65% of the vote. It was his most competitive primary in recent history. In the general election, Carper defeated Republican nominee Rob Arlett, 60.0% to 37.8%.

====2024====
On May 22, 2023, Carper announced that he would not seek reelection in 2024. In his press conference, Carper endorsed U.S. Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester.

===Tenure===

Carper served with the Democratic minority in the 108th and 109th Congresses and was part of the Democratic majority in the 110th Congress. At the beginning of the 107th Congress, the Democratic Party was in the minority, but later held the majority. Carper was a member of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), of which he served as vice chair. In 2004, Carper became part of the Senate Democratic leadership. As a member of a four-person &quot;Executive Committee&quot;, he is one of four deputy whips. David Broder of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; has called Carper &quot;a notably effective and non-partisan leader, admired and trusted on both sides of the aisle.&quot;

During the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Carper said he did not support invoking the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or impeachment of Trump. But hours later, he called on Trump to resign. He also called the attackers &quot;domestic terrorists&quot;. That evening, he voted to certify the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.

===Committee assignments===
Carper&#x27;s committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:
* Committee on Environment and Public Works (chair)
** As chair, Carper is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees.
* Committee on Finance
** Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure
** Subcommittee on Health Care
** Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness (chair)
* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs
** Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
** Subcommittee on Government Operations and Border Management

===Caucus membership===
* Senate Oceans Caucus

==Political positions==
Carper is considered a moderate Democrat. He has a 13% conservative rating from the American Conservative Union. Carper voted for the Budget Control Act, against cut, cap and balance, for debt increase, for debt ceiling increase, for debt limit increase, for the stimulus, for TARP, for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, for SCHIP, for DREAM, and for the Immigration Reform Act of 2006.

=== Abortion ===
Carper has a mixed record on abortion issues. In 2003, he was one of 17 Democrats who broke with the majority of their party by voting to ban partial-birth abortion. He also voted against banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but voted to ban the use of federal funds for abortion. In 2018, he opposed President Trump&#x27;s proposal to defund Planned Parenthood. Carper was given a 50% rating by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a mixed record on abortion, according to their scoring, and a 25% rating from the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee. After &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was overturned in June 2022, he said the decision was &quot;unconscionably cruel and wrong&quot; and that it was a &quot;dark day for our country and our Constitution.&quot;

=== Foreign policy ===
In April 2019, Carper was one of thirty-four senators to sign a letter to President Trump encouraging him &quot;to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America&quot;, asserting that Trump had &quot;consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance&quot; since becoming president and that he was &quot;personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity&quot; through preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S., citing the funding&#x27;s helping to improve conditions in those countries.

In January 2024, Carper voted against a resolution, proposed by Bernie Sanders, to apply the human rights provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act to U.S. aid to Israel&#x27;s military. The proposal was defeated, 72 to 11. In March 2024, Carper led a letter to the Biden administration urging the U.S. to recognize a &quot;nonmilitarized&quot; Palestinian state after the war in Gaza. This letter was signed by 19 Democratic senators who support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestine conflict.

===Gun law===
Carper joined 23 other Senate Democrats in signing a letter supporting Obama taking executive action to reduce gun violence. In 2013, he voted to ban high-capacity magazines of over 10 bullets. In 2016, Carper participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster. In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Carper called for more gun laws, specifically background checks and mental health screenings.

In January 2019, Carper was one of forty senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, a bill that would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill&#x27;s background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, providing firearms as gifts to members of one&#x27;s immediate family, firearms being transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense.

===Finance and economy===
He joined in the unsuccessful attempt to tie the Bush administration tax cuts to deficit reduction and has supported additional funding for school choice programs and charter schools. He has also sought additional funding for railroad projects and for rail security. He strongly supported legislation to limit class action lawsuits and to restrict personal bankruptcy. In addition, he is a strong proponent of free trade. In 2012, Carper sponsored a bill, eventually passed and signed into law, that required government agencies to identify $125 billion in expected waste and fraud.

Carper and George Voinovich of Ohio proposed a 25-cent raise in the federal gasoline tax; 10 cents would go to pay down the debt and the rest toward improving the nation&#x27;s infrastructure. The measure was proposed in November 2010. The measure did not pass.

On May 14, 2011, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; criticized a postal-bailout bill co-sponsored by Carper and Susan Collins (R-Maine). The bill would give $50–$75 billion to USPS, and would underwrite pension obligations for retired postal workers. The bailout would cost three times the savings of the 2011 federal budget.

On August 1, 2019, the Senate passed a bipartisan budget deal that raised spending over current levels by $320 billion and lifted the debt ceiling for the following two years in addition to forming a course for funding the government without the perceived fiscal brinkmanship of recent years. Carper joined Joe Manchin and Republicans Mitt Romney and Rick Scott in issuing a statement asserting that &quot;as former Governors, we were responsible for setting a budget each year that was fiscally responsible to fund our priorities. That&#x27;s why today, we, as U.S. Senators, cannot bring ourselves to vote for this budget deal that does not put our country on a fiscally sustainable path.&quot;

===Environment===
Carper proposed the creation of a National Park in Delaware, the Coastal Heritage Park, in four locations along the Delaware River and Delaware Bay. In January 2009, Carper briefly chaired a Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works hearing on the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s coal ash spill in Kingston, Tennessee. However, he did vote for Keystone XL Pipeline, but has since expressed disappointment in that vote.

Carper supports the EPA and Clean Air Act and blames states to the west of Delaware for its air pollution, calling them &quot;America&#x27;s tailpipe&quot;.

=== Housing ===
In April 2019, Carper was one of forty-one senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing &quot;HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country&quot; and expressing disappointment that President Trump&#x27;s budget &quot;has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.&quot; The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.

===Technology===
Carper co-wrote the &quot;Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010&quot; introduced on June 19, 2010, by Senator Joe Lieberman (Senator Susan Collins is the third co-author of this bill). If signed into law, this controversial bill, which the American media dubbed the &quot;Kill switch bill&quot;, would grant the President emergency powers over the Internet. All three co-authors of the bill, however, issued a statement claiming that instead, the bill &quot;[narrowed] existing broad Presidential authority to take over telecommunications networks&quot;. Carper was quoted as saying that the bill &quot;would create a National Center for Cybersecurity and Communications in the Department of Homeland Security, with a Senate-confirmed director to oversee security of the federal government&#x27;s computer networks. The center would also identify vulnerabilities and help secure key private networks – like utilities and communications systems – that, if attacked or commandeered by a foreign power or cyberterrorists, could result in the crippling of our economy.&quot;

===Consumer regulations===
In May 2010, Carper introduced an amendment to limit state regulators from enforcing consumer regulations on national banks and their subsidiaries. It would also remove a Senate legislative measure requiring the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to find a &quot;substantive standard&quot; on regulation, before the office could move to preempt. The White House opposed Carper&#x27;s amendment. The amendment passed by a vote of 80–18.

===Employment===
====Jobs bill====
On September 21, 2011, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; noted that President Obama&#x27;s job-creation plans were drawing resistance from Senate Democrats. The article quoted Carper as saying, &quot;I think the best jobs bill that can be passed is a comprehensive long-term deficit-reduction plan. That&#x27;s better than everything else the president is talking about combined.&quot;

====Minimum wage====
In April 2014, the United States Senate debated the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period. The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. Carper said that he preferred legislation that would have a greater chance of becoming law, such as an increase to only $9 an hour.

On March 5, 2021, Carper voted against Bernie Sanders&#x27;s amendment to include a $15/hour minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

=== LGBT rights ===
Carper signed a law as Governor defining &quot;marriage as between a man and a woman,&quot; but he also voted as a Senator against the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. He also voted against banning gay marriage again in 2006. In 2013, Carper announced that he now supports same-sex marriage.

=== Iraq War ===
Carper voted yes on the 2002 Iraq War Resolution.

==Personal life==
Carper has been married twice, first in 1978, to Diane Beverly Isaacs, a former Miss Delaware, who had two children by a previous marriage. They divorced in 1983. In a 1998 interview, Carper admitted, &quot;I slapped my then-wife, Diane, during a heated argument&quot;, calling it a mistake. According to a 1982 New York Post article, Carper hit Isaacs &quot;so hard he gave her a black eye&quot; and his wife&#x27;s two children from a previous relationship &quot;were slapped around and bruised by Carper for doing such things as leaving the family dog on the bed&quot;. Carper denied these claims.

Carper married Martha Ann Stacy in 1985. They have two children. The family are members of Westminster Presbyterian Church in Wilmington, Delaware.

Unlike most senators, who maintain residences in both Washington, D.C., and in their home state, Carper commuted more than 100 miles by Amtrak train from his home in Wilmington to the United States Capitol. He said this arrangement helped his family live a normal life despite his demanding, high-profile job. On May 12, 2015, he narrowly escaped injury when the train he took home derailed and crashed in Philadelphia shortly after he debarked. In 2024, Newark Train Station was renamed in his honor.

===Finances===
As of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Carper&#x27;s net worth was more than $5.7 million.

In August 2023, Congresstrading.com tweeted that Carper, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, made an inverse Nasdaq ETF purchase, a short sell option for investors looking to hedge against or profit from a decline in the index. The tweet questioned whether this was a conflict of interest for Carper.

==Almanac==
Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. The Governor and State Treasurer take office the third Tuesday of January. The Governor has a four-year term and the State Treasurer had a two-year term at this time. U.S. Representatives take office January 3 and have a two-year term. U.S. Senators also take office January 3, but have a six-year term.

<text>Galileo&#x27;s paradox is a demonstration of one of the surprising properties of infinite sets. In his final scientific work, &quot;Two New Sciences&quot;, Galileo Galilei made apparently contradictory statements about the positive integers. First, a square is an integer which is the square of an integer. Some numbers are squares, while others are not; therefore, all the numbers, including both squares and non-squares, must be more numerous than just the squares. And yet, for every number there is exactly one square; hence, there cannot be more of one than of the other. This is an early use, though not the first, of the idea of one-to-one correspondence in the context of infinite sets.

Galileo concluded that the ideas of &quot;less&quot;, &quot;equal&quot;, and &quot;greater&quot; apply to finite quantities but not to infinite quantities. During the nineteenth century Cantor found a framework in which this restriction is not necessary; it is possible to define comparisons amongst infinite sets in a meaningful way (by which definition the two sets, integers and squares, have &quot;the same size&quot;), and that by this definition some infinite sets are strictly larger than others.

The ideas were not new with Galileo, but his name has come to be associated with them. In particular, Duns Scotus, about 1302, compared even numbers to the whole of numbers.

<doc id="339197" wikidata="Q7144890" url="?curid=339197" title="Pathways into Darkness">
<text>Pathways into Darkness is a first-person shooter adventure video game developed and published by Bungie in 1993, for Macintosh personal computers. Players assume the role of a Special Forces soldier who must stop a powerful, godlike being from awakening and destroying the world. Players solve puzzles and defeat enemies to unlock parts of a pyramid where the god sleeps; the game&#x27;s ending changes depending on player actions.

&quot;Pathways&quot; began as a sequel to Bungie&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, before the developers created an original story. Jason Jones programmed the game, while his friend Colin Brent developed the environments and creatures. The game features three-dimensional, texture-mapped graphics and stereo sound on supported Macintosh models. &quot;Pathways&quot; was critically acclaimed and won a host of awards; it was also Bungie&#x27;s first major commercial success and enabled the two-man team of Jason Jones and Alex Seropian to move into a Chicago office and begin paying staff.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Pathways into Darkness&quot; is a first-person shooter and adventure game. The game interface consists of four windows. The primary &quot;World View&quot; shows the player character&#x27;s first-person perspective. Players move, dodge, fire, and use weapons and items using the computer keyboard. The &quot;Inventory&quot; window displays items players have acquired, the &quot;Message&quot; window relates events and the in-game time, and the &quot;Player&quot; window displays health and energy information. The game clock runs constantly during gameplay, except when in conversation; the player loses the game if the sleeping god wakes after a set period of time.

Players fight various monsters as they explore the pyramid&#x27;s halls and catacombs. They may pick up weapons and ammunition left behind by others to supplement their arsenal. As additional levels are unlocked, new weapons become available, including machine guns and grenade launchers. Players can absorb a certain amount of damage, but once their health reaches zero, they must resume their progress at the last saved checkpoint. Resting in place replenishes health but saps game time and leaves the player open to attack. Scattered throughout the levels are other items players may use. Potions have different effects: rare blue potions, for example, rid the player character of poison and damage. Other items provide money, or points that increases the player character&#x27;s maximum health. Crystals can be used against enemies to freeze, burn, or otherwise harm them.

Through the use of the yellow crystal, players can converse with Previously Living Sentient Beings or &quot;PLSBs&quot;. Conversations provide players with puzzle information, strategies for defeating monsters, and story background. Rather than relying on a branching tree of conversation options, players type keywords into a dialogue box. When a certain keyword (typically found in a previous statement by the dead person in question) is entered, the dead person will give a response. The manual gives a starting point by mentioning that all dead people respond to &quot;name&quot; and &quot;death&quot;, by giving their name and describing how they died, respectively.

==Plot==
&quot;Pathways&quot; casts the player as a member of a US Army Special Forces team sent on a mission to the Yucatán Peninsula. On May 5, 1994, a diplomat from the alien race known as the Jjaro appeared to the President of the United States and informed him that on May 13, an ancient godlike being sleeping beneath a pyramid would awaken and destroy the Earth. The only way to prevent this catastrophe is to prevent the god from awakening. The eight-man Special Forces team carries a nuclear weapon, with the goal of entering the ancient pyramid, descending to the bottom level where the god sleeps, and activating the bomb to stun the god and bury it under tons of rock.

The player character&#x27;s parachute fails to open, and they fall unconscious in the landing. Awakening hours later, the player finds almost all their equipment inoperable. Reaching the pyramid on foot hours after the rest of their team, the player must complete the mission before the god awakens in five days. In the pyramid, the player finds bodies of squad-mates, the remains of Spanish-speaking treasure hunters, and fallen members of a Nazi expedition from the 1930s who were looking for a secret weapon. Additional plot elements can be revealed by speaking to these dead, enabled by the yellow crystal.

The game&#x27;s ending changes depending on whether the player has a radio beacon to call for extraction, and when the nuclear device is set to explode. Forgetting to set the bomb, or setting it to explode at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth&#x27;s destruction. The device&#x27;s detonation before the player reaches a minimum safe distance results in a pyrrhic victory. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with a beacon for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before the device is set to go off, or without a beacon if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot.

==Development==
&quot;Pathways&quot; was Bungie&#x27;s fourth game and third commercial title after their previous game, &quot;Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete&quot;, sold around 2,500 copies. In the summer of 1992, Jones was living in dorms at the University of Chicago when he saw &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, a shooter game with three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Inspired, Jones created a rough 3D-graphics engine for the Mac that simulated walls with trapezoids and rectangles. Originally, Bungie intended &quot;Pathways&quot; to be a straightforward 3D version of &quot;Minotaur&quot;, but they quickly found that the top-down perspective of their previous game did not mesh with the new 3D presentation. An additional consideration was that the developers wanted to create a game that did not rely on then-rare networks and modems, an issue in marketing &quot;Minotaur&quot;. The rest of 1992 was spent tweaking the graphics engine.

Work on the game&#x27;s storyline and levels began in January 1993. Jones recalled that starting from cliché plots, they moved towards &quot;very interesting and unique but extremely difficult to understand stories&quot;. One of the plot ideas cast the player as one of a group of Roman soldiers who discovered a mountain spring that extended their lives. Every seven years one soldier would be picked to descend into the caves and bring back more water. If the leader died, a new one would be selected to undertake the journey to ensure their survival. &quot;It was a very interesting plot since your quest wasn&#x27;t necessarily virtuous, it didn&#x27;t involve doing good things or saving the world,&quot; Jones said. &quot;It was just you were chosen, more or less against your will, to become the next leader of this freak cult of immortals.&quot; The final plot occupied a middle ground between the simple and complex stories, because the developers did not want to force players to become deeply involved in the story.

While Bungie founder Alex Seropian handled the business aspect of Bungie and produced the game&#x27;s box art and promotional material, Jones programmed the game, wrote the story line, and contributed to the game&#x27;s manual. Whereas Jones had single-handedly coded &quot;Minotaur&quot;, the small staff for &quot;Pathways&quot; was due to lack of money for a large team. To speed implementation, Jones built a level editor for the game that allowed him to add objects, monsters, and walls to the levels. The game&#x27;s levels and mazes span 40 million scaled square feet. Jones&#x27; friend, Colin Brent, did much of the art and creature design. This reduced Jones&#x27; workload and, in the programmer&#x27;s opinion, improved the art. Each monster was drawn by hand in different states such as stationary, moving, attacking, and dying. The drawings were scanned into the computer and added to the game; if there were problems, they were redrawn. Once the final drawings were complete, the images were colorized in 24-bit color using Adobe Photoshop. Despite the game&#x27;s advanced graphics, &quot;Pathways&quot; was designed to work on any Macintosh model; it was one of 30 applications that ran natively on Apple&#x27;s PowerMacs on launch day.

By July 1993 the game was behind schedule; only the above-ground portions of the pyramid were complete. Jones put in eighteen-hour days for the month leading up to the MacWorld Expo where the game was to be sold. He finished the game in a relatively bug-free state just before the Expo, and Bungie had 500 shrinkwrapped copies of the game available for sale at MacWorld. Due to the game&#x27;s difficulty, Bungie published an official hint book.

==Reception==
&quot;Pathways&quot; was positively received. Inside Mac Games reviewer Jon Blum wrote that &quot;Pathways&quot; was &quot;one of the best Macintosh games I&#x27;ve ever played&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described &quot;Pathways&quot; as &quot;a dungeon crawl, pure and simple&quot;. The magazine praised the &quot;simple, elegant and easy to use&quot; user interface and &quot;excellent&quot; graphics and sound. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; concluded that while &quot;somewhat weak on actual game play&quot;, &quot;Pathways&quot; was &quot;a job worthy of a strong recommendation&quot;. &quot;Macworld&quot;″s Steven Levy commented that the gameplay and graphics were extremely smooth. He singled out the creatures for specific praise, likening them to &quot;something that might have come from a brain-merge of Tim Burton, Anne Rice and Hieronymus Bosch&quot; instead of simple line drawings. Criticisms of the game included the difficulty level; Blum found some segments too difficult and that it was possible to spend hours playing before realizing that the player had made an irreversible mistake. Reviewers also found the limited number of save spots and sparse ammunition frustrating. Jones admitted that the game was harder than he had intended. The title received several awards, including Inside Mac Games&#x27; &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Macworld&quot;″s &quot;Best Role-Playing Game&quot;, and was listed on the &quot;MacUser&quot; 100.

&quot;Pathways&quot; sold more than 20,000 copies, beating expectations and making it Bungie&#x27;s first commercial success. It was the third bestselling Macintosh title of the first half of 1994 after &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;Sim City 2000&quot;, with projected seven-figure sales for the year. The game made Bungie enough money that the company was able to move from Seropian&#x27;s apartment to a dedicated office in Chicago&#x27;s South Side. At their new location, the Bungie team expanded and began work on another first-person shooter, &quot;Marathon&quot;. Interviewed by Inside Mac Games, Jones said that he did not believe that there would ever be a sequel to &quot;Pathways&quot;. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of reasons for that, one of them being that I tend to dislike sequels,&quot; he said, &quot;A lot of cool things have happened with the rendering technology since &quot;Pathways&quot; shipped, and it suggests some different products which don&#x27;t really fit into the &quot;Pathways&quot; world.&quot;

&quot;Pathways&quot; would later be bundled in a box set with the &quot;Marathon&quot; series in 1997. A Mac OS X port of the game was produced by Man Up Time Studios in 2013, members of whom were early Bungie fans that became acquainted with the company through &quot;Pathways&quot;. A community made conversion to the Aleph One source port has also been produced.

<doc id="339202" wikidata="Q1951220" url="?curid=339202" title="Tall tale">
<text>A tall tale is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual. Some tall tales are exaggerations of actual events, for example (&quot;the fish that got away&quot;) such as, &quot;That fish was so big, why I tell ya&#x27;, it nearly sank the boat when I pulled it in!&quot; Other tall tales are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the European countryside, the American frontier, the Canadian Northwest, the Australian outback, or the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.

Events are often told in a way that makes the narrator seem to have been a part of the story; the tone is generally good-natured. Legends are differentiated from tall tales primarily by age; many legends exaggerate the exploits of their heroes, but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large, to the extent of dominating the story.

==United States==
The tall tale has become a fundamental element of American folk literature. The tall tale&#x27;s origins are seen in the bragging contests that often occurred when the rough men of the American frontier gathered. The tales of legendary figures of the Old West, some listed below, owe much to the style of tall tales.

The semi-annual speech-contests held by Toastmasters International public-speaking clubs may include a tall-tales contest. Each and every participating speaker is given three to five minutes to give a short speech of a tall-tale nature, and is then judged according to several factors. The winner proceeds to the next level of competition. The contest does not proceed beyond any participating district in the organization to the international level.

The comic strip &quot;Non Sequitur&quot; (1992–present) sometimes features tall tales told by the character Captain Eddie; it is left up to the reader to decide if he is telling the truth, exaggerating a real event, or fabricating a story entirely.

===About real people===
Some stories are told about exaggerated versions of real people:
*Johnny Appleseed – a friendly folk-hero who traveled the West planting apple trees because he felt his guardian angel told him to
*Johnny Blood – an American football player whose reputation for wild behavior was as well known as his on-field play
*Jim Bowie – A Kentuckian frontiersman, Texas Ranger, and land speculator who fought for the Texan cause in the Battle of the Alamo. He is known for the Bowie knife which he used to disembowel opponents.
*Daniel Boone – blazed a trail across Cumberland Gap to found the first English-speaking colonies west of the Appalachian Mountains
*Aylett C. &quot;Strap&quot; Buckner – an Indian fighter of colonial Texas
*Annie Christmas – a Louisiana keelboat captain, who in real life was white, but in folklore and tall tales was turned into an African-American supernaturally strong woman who defied the gender norms of the time.
*Davy Crockett – a pioneer and U.S. Congressman from Tennessee who later died at the Battle of the Alamo
*Mike Fink – the toughest boatman on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and a rival of Davy Crockett. Also known as the King of the Mississippi River Keelboatmen.
*Peter Francisco – American Revolutionary War hero
*John Henry – a mighty steel-driving African American
*Calamity Jane – a tough Wild-West woman
*Jigger Johnson (1871–1935), a lumberjack and log driver from Maine who is known for his numerous off-the-job exploits, such as catching bobcats alive with his bare hands, and drunken brawls
*Casey Jones – a brave and gritty railroad engineer
*Nat Love, also known as &quot;Deadwood Dick&quot;, was born a slave in Tennessee in 1854. Tales of his adventures after emancipation, as a cowboy and as a Pullman porter, gained such fantastical elements as to be considered tall tales
*Sam Patch – an early 19th-century daredevil who died during a jump on Friday the 13th
*Molly Pitcher – a heroine of the American Revolutionary War
*Blackbeard spawned various tall tales surrounding his involvement with piracy from 1717–1718

===About imaginary people===

Subjects of some American tall tales include legendary figures:
*Paul Bunyan – huge lumberjack who eats 50 pancakes in one minute, dug the Grand Canyon with his axe, made Minnesota&#x27;s ten thousand lakes with his footprints, and also has a blue ox named Babe who made the Mississippi River
*Tony Beaver – a West Virginia lumberjack and cousin of Paul Bunyan
*Pecos Bill – legendary cowboy who &quot;tamed the wild west&quot;
*Cordwood Pete – younger brother to lumberjack Paul Bunyan
*Febold Feboldson – a Nebraska farmer who could fight a drought
*Johnny Kaw, a fictional Kansan whose mythological status itself was in one sense a figment, in that it was created recently, in 1955. Adherents of this assessment deem such stories fakelore.
*Joe Magarac – a Pittsburgh steelworker made of steel
*Alfred Bulltop Stormalong – an immense sailor whose ship was so big that it scraped the Moon
*Mose Humphreys; a brave NYC firefighter
*Honeydipper Dan; a 20 foot tall outhouse cleaner.

==Australia==
The Australian frontier (known as the bush or the outback) similarly inspired the types of tall tales that are found in American folklore. The Australian versions typically concern a mythical station called The Speewah. The heroes of the Speewah include:
*Rodney Ansell 
*Big Bill – The dumbest man on the Speewah who made his living cutting up mining shafts and selling them for post holes
*Crooked Mick – A champion shearer who had colossal strength and quick wit.

Another folk hero is Charlie McKeahnie, the hero of Banjo Paterson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;, whose bravery, adaptability, and risk-taking could epitomise the new Australian spirit.

==Canada==
The Canadian frontier has also inspired the types of tall tales that are found in American folklore, such as: 
*French Canadian tales of Big Joe Mufferaw, a giant of a lumberjack and woodsman from the Ottawa Valley, loosely based on real-life lumberjack Joseph Montferrand
*Johnny Chinook, a Métis cowboy and rancher in Alberta.
*Sam McGee, the hero of Robert Service&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Cremation of Sam McGee&quot; (1907)

==Europe==
Some European tall tales include:
*Toell the Great was one of the great tall tales of Estonia.
*The Babin Republic, in Renaissance Poland (1568), was a satirical society dedicated entirely to mocking people and telling tall tales.
*Juho Nätti (1890–1964), known as Nätti-Jussi, was a Finnish lumberjack known for telling tall tales; his stories have also circulated as folk tales and been collected in books.
*&quot;The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel&quot; (16th century) by the French writer François Rabelais told the tale of two giants; father and son.
*The many farfetched adventures of the fictional German nobleman Baron Munchausen, most prominently in the novel &quot;Baron Munchausen&#x27;s Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia&quot; (1785) by Rudolf Erich Raspe and the following German supplemented adaptation by Gottfried August Bürger, are loosely based on Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen (1720−1797).
*Legends of the Irish mythological hunter-warrior Fionn mac Cumhaill, also known as Finn MacCool, have it that he built the Giant&#x27;s Causeway as stepping-stones to Scotland, so as not to get his feet wet, and that he also once scooped up part of Ireland to fling it at a rival, but it missed and landed in the Irish Sea; the clump became the Isle of Man, the pebble became Rockall, and the void became Lough Neagh.
*&quot;Laughter and Grief by the White Sea&quot;, a Soviet film, depicts tall tales of the Pomors. A Pomor elder describes several stories, including a brown bear coating himself in baking soda to be acceptable to humans as a polar bear. 
*The Cumbrian Liars, a United Kingdom association who follow in the seven-league footsteps of Will Ritson.
*&quot;The Irish Rover&quot; is a well-known Irish folk song about an implausibly large sailing ship with a fanciful cargo.
*Oskar, later known as &quot;Unsinkable Sam,&quot; was a ship&#x27;s cat that was supposed to have survived the sinking of three ships during WWII: the German &quot;Bismarck&quot; on 27th May, 1941, HMS &quot;Cossack&quot; on 27th October, 1941, and finally HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; on 14th November, 1941. While photographs exist of a ship&#x27;s cat purported to be Oskar on HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, the historicity of this legend is debated.

==In visual media==

Early 20th-century postcards became a vehicle for tall tale telling in the US. Creators of these cards, such as the prolific Alfred Stanley Johnson Jr. and William H. &quot;Dad&quot; Martin, usually employed trick photography, including forced perspective, while others painted their unlikely , or used a combination of painting and photography in early examples of photo retouching. The common theme was : fishing for leviathans, hunting for or riding oversized animals, and bringing in the impossibly huge . An homage to the genre can be found on the cover of the &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; (1972) album by The Allman Brothers Band.

<doc id="339203" wikidata="Q505749" url="?curid=339203" title="Chick Webb">
<text>William Henry &quot;Chick&quot; Webb (February 10, 1905 – June 16, 1939) was an American jazz and swing music drummer and band leader.

==Early life==
Webb was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to William H. and Marie Webb. The year of his birth is disputed. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and Allmusic indicate 1905, and this seems to be supported by census information. Other publications claim other years. During Webb&#x27;s lifetime, a December 1937 &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine article, &quot;The Rise of a Crippled Genius&quot;, stated he was born in 1909, which is the year that appears on his grave marker. In 1939, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Webb was born in 1907, the year also suggested in &quot;Rhythm on Record&quot; by Hilton Schleman.

Webb was one of four children; the other three were sisters (Bessie, Mabel, and Ethel). His sister Mabel married Wilbur Porter around 1928. When an infant, Webb fell down some stairsteps in his family&#x27;s home, crushing several vertebrae and requiring surgery, from which he never regained full mobility. The injury progressed to tuberculosis of the spine, leaving him with short stature and a badly deformed spine which caused him to appear hunchbacked. The idea of playing an instrument was suggested by his doctor to &quot;loosen up&quot; his bones. He supported himself as a newspaper boy to save enough money to buy drums, and first played professionally at age 11.

==Career==
At the age of 17, he moved to New York City and by 1926 was leading his own band in Harlem. Jazz drummer Tommy Benford said he gave Webb drum lessons when he first reached New York.

He alternated between band tours and residencies at New York City clubs through the late 1920s. In 1931, his band became the house band at the Savoy Ballroom. He became one of the best-regarded bandleaders and drummers of the new &quot;swing&quot; style. Drummer Buddy Rich cited Webb&#x27;s powerful technique and virtuoso performances as heavily influential on his own drumming, and even referred to Webb as &quot;the daddy of them all&quot;. Webb was unable to read music, and instead memorized the arrangements played by the band and conducted from a platform in the center. He used custom-made pedals, goose-neck cymbal holders, a 28-inch bass drum and other percussion instruments.

At the Savoy, Webb competed in battle of the bands contests with the Benny Goodman Orchestra and the Count Basie Orchestra. Webb lost to Duke Ellington in 1937. Although a judge declared Webb&#x27;s band the winner in 1938 over Count Basie&#x27;s, and Basie himself said he was relieved to come away from the contest without embarrassing himself, musicians debated the result for decades.

Webb married Martha Loretta Ferguson (also known as &quot;Sally&quot;), and in 1935 he began featuring a teenaged Ella Fitzgerald as a vocalist. Webb and Fitzgerald performed hits such as &quot;A-Tisket, A-Tasket&quot;, which was composed by Van Alexander at Fitzgerald&#x27;s request. Despite rumors to the contrary, &quot;Ella was not adopted by Webb, nor did she live with him and his wife, Sally,&quot; according to Stuart Nicholson in his Fitzgerald biography.

==Declining health and death==
In November 1938, Webb&#x27;s health began to decline; for a time, however, he continued to play, refusing to give up touring so that his band could remain employed during the Great Depression. He disregarded his own discomfort and fatigue, which often found him passing out from physical exhaustion after finishing sets. Finally, he had a major operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore in 1939. Webb died from Pott disease on June 16, 1939, in Baltimore. Reportedly his last words were, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;ve got to go.&quot; Webb was buried in Baltimore County, in Arbutus Memorial Park, in Arbutus, Maryland.

Webb&#x27;s death hit the jazz/swing community very hard. After his death, Ella Fitzgerald led the Chick Webb band until she left to focus on her solo career in 1942, causing the band to break up. Art Blakey and Duke Ellington both credited Webb with influencing their music. Gene Krupa credited Webb with raising drummer awareness and paving the way for drummer-led bands like his own. Webb&#x27;s thundering solos created a complexity and an energy that paved the way for Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson.

On February 12, 1940, a crowd of about 7,500 people attended a Chick Webb Benefit in Baltimore, Maryland. In attendance were Sally Webb, Chick&#x27;s widow, his mother Marie Webb, his sister Mabel Porter, Governor Herbert R. O&#x27;Conor, Fitzgerald and boxing champion Joe Louis.

<doc id="339208" wikidata="Q104668" url="?curid=339208" title="Vitaly Ginzburg">
<text>Vitaly Lazarevich Ginzburg (; – 8 November 2009) was a Russian physicist who was honored with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2003, together with Alexei Abrikosov and Anthony Leggett for their &quot;pioneering contributions to the theory of superconductors and superfluids.&quot;

He spent his career in the former Soviet Union and was one of the leading figure in former Soviet program of nuclear weapons, working towards designs of the thermonuclear devices. He became a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and succeeded Igor Tamm as head of the Department of Theoretical Physics of the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (FIAN). In his later life, Ginzburg become an outspoken atheist and was critical of clergy&#x27;s influence in Russian society.

==Biography==
Vitaly Ginzburg was born to a Jewish family in Moscow on 4 October 1916— the son of an engineer, Lazar Yefimovich Ginzburg, and a doctor, Augusta Wildauer who was a graduate from the Physics Faculty of Moscow State University in 1938. After attending his mother&#x27;s alma mater, he defended his qualifications of the candidate&#x27;s (&quot;Kandidat Nauk&quot;) dissertation in 1940, and his comprehensive thesis for the doctor&#x27;s (&quot;Doktor Nauk&quot;) qualification in 1942. In 1944, he became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Among his achievements are a partially phenomenological theory of superconductivity, the Ginzburg–Landau theory, developed with Lev Landau in 1950; the theory of electromagnetic wave propagation in plasmas (for example, in the ionosphere); and a theory of the origin of cosmic radiation. He is also known to biologists as being part of the group of scientists that helped bring down the reign of the politically connected anti-Mendelian agronomist Trofim Lysenko, thus allowing modern genetic science to return to the USSR.

In 1937, Ginzburg married Olga Zamsha. In 1946, he married his second wife, Nina Ginzburg (&quot;nee&quot; Yermakova), who had spent more than a year in custody on fabricated charges of plotting to assassinate the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.

As a renowned professor and researcher, Ginzburg was an obvious candidate for the Soviet bomb project. From 1948 through 1952 Ginzburg worked under Igor Kurchatov to help with the hydrogen bomb. Ginzburg and Igor Tamm both proposed ideas that would make it possible to build a hydrogen bomb. When the bomb project moved to Arzamas-16 to continue in even more secrecy, Ginzburg was not allowed to follow. Instead he stayed in Moscow and supported from afar, staying under watch due to his background and past. As the work got continuously more classified, Ginzburg was phased out of the project and allowed to pursue his true passion, superconductors. During the Cold War, the thirst for knowledge and technological advancement was never-ending. This was no different with the research done on superconductors. The Soviet Union believed that the research done on superconductors would place them ahead of their American counterparts. Both sides sought to leverage the potential military applications of superconductors.

Ginzburg was the editor-in-chief of the scientific journal &quot;Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk&quot;. He also headed the Academic Department of Physics and Astrophysics Problems, which Ginzburg founded at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in 1968.

Ginzburg identified as a secular Jew, and following the collapse of communism in the former Soviet Union, he was very active in Jewish life, especially in Russia, where he served on the board of directors of the Russian Jewish Congress. He is also well known for fighting anti-Semitism and supporting the state of Israel.

In the 2000s (decade), Ginzburg was politically active, supporting the Russian liberal opposition and human rights movement. He defended Igor Sutyagin and Valentin Danilov against charges of espionage put forth by the authorities. On 2 April 2009, in an interview to the Radio Liberty Ginzburg denounced the FSB as an institution harmful to Russia and the ongoing expansion of its authority as a return to Stalinism.

Ginzburg worked at the P. N. Lebedev Physical Institute of Soviet and Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow since 1940. Russian Academy of Sciences is a major institution where mostly all Nobel Prize laureates of physics from Russia have done their studies and/or research works.

==Stance on religion==
Ginzburg was an avowed atheist, both under the militantly atheist Soviet government and in post-Communist Russia when religion made a strong revival. He criticized clericalism in the press and wrote several books devoted to the questions of religion and atheism. Because of this, some Orthodox Christian groups denounced him and said no science award could excuse his verbal attacks on the Russian Orthodox Church. He was one of the signers of the Open letter to the President Vladimir V. Putin from the Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences against clericalisation of Russia.

== Nobel Prize ==
Vitaly Ginzburg, along with Anthony Leggett and Alexei Abrikosov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2003 for their groundbreaking work on the theory of superconductors. The Nobel Prize recognized Ginzburg&#x27;s work in theoretical physics, specifically his contributions to understanding the behavior of matter at extremely low temperatures.

His collaboration with Lev Landau in 1950 led to the development of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, which became paramount to later work on superconductors. Landau had been working on superconductors for years before their partnership, with Landau publishing many papers between 1941 and 1947 on the properties of quantum fluids at extremely low temperatures. Lev Landau would later receive a Nobel Prize in 1962 for this research on the properties of the superfluid liquid helium in 1941. Before their collaboration, Landau had just done research on liquid helium and other quantum fluids, but Ginzburg allowed them to go a step further.

Ginzburg introduced the concept of an order parameter, which would allow them to characterize the state of the superconductor. To do this, they derived a complex set of equations that would allow them to describe the behavior of the superconductor. These equations provided a model from which researchers can understand the transition between a normal and superconducting state, as well as be able to predict various properties of other superconductors. Using these equations, they were also able to introduce the Ginzburg-Landau Parameter. This parameter used a separate set of equations in order to classify if they were looking at a Type-I or Type-II superconductor. This advancement allowed Anthony Leggett to build upon it and complete his own research on superconductors.

This research on superconductors allowed many new technological advancements to unfold, including some we can see in everyday life. The use of superconductors can be seen in MRI machines, engines, and new Maglev trains.

== Death ==
A spokeswoman for the Russian Academy of Sciences announced that Ginzburg died in Moscow on 8 November 2009 from cardiac arrest. He had been suffering from ill health for several years, and three years before his death said &quot;In general, I envy believers. I am 90, and [am] being overcome by illnesses. For believers, it is easier to deal with them and with life&#x27;s other hardships. But what can be done? I cannot believe in resurrection after death.&quot;

Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin sent his condolences to Ginzburg&#x27;s family, saying &quot;We bid farewell to an extraordinary personality whose outstanding talent, exceptional strength of character and firmness of convictions evoked true respect from his colleagues&quot;. President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, in his letter of condolences, described Ginzburg as a &quot;top physicist of our time whose discoveries had a huge impact on the development of national and world science.&quot;

Ginzburg was buried on 11 November in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, the resting place of many famous politicians, writers and scientists of Russia.

<doc id="339211" wikidata="Q925052" url="?curid=339211" title="Tim Johnson (South Dakota politician)">
<text>Timothy Peter Johnson (December 28, 1946 – October 8, 2024) was an American lawyer and politician who served as a United States senator from South Dakota from 1997 to 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the United States representative for from 1987 to 1997 and in the state legislature from 1979 to 1987. Johnson is the last Democrat to hold statewide and/or congressional office in South Dakota. He and Stephanie Herseth are also the last Democrats to win a statewide election in South Dakota, as well as a federal election.

==Early life, education and legal career==
Johnson was born in Canton, South Dakota, the son of Ruth Jorinda (née Ljostveit), a homemaker, and Vandel Charles Johnson, an educator. He had Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish ancestry. Raised in Vermillion, Johnson earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1969 and a Master of Arts in 1970, both in political science, from the University of South Dakota, where he was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.

After doing post-graduate studies at Michigan State University from 1970 to 1971, a period during which he worked for the Michigan Senate, Johnson returned to Vermillion to attend the University of South Dakota School of Law and earned his Juris Doctor in 1975; he went into private practice immediately thereafter. He did not take the bar exam as he was admitted to the South Dakota bar under the state&#x27;s diploma privilege.

==Early political career==
Johnson served in the South Dakota House of Representatives from 1979 to 1982 and in the South Dakota Senate from 1983 to 1986. He served as Clay County deputy state&#x27;s attorney in 1985 during his tenure in the South Dakota Senate. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives from in 1986. During his first term, he introduced more legislation than any other freshman member of the House. Between 1991 and 1994, he served as a regional whip for the Democratic Party. He left the House in 1997, when his Senate tenure began.

==United States Senate==
Johnson&#x27;s Senate career began in 1997.

In December 2006, Johnson suffered a brain hemorrhage. His condition was viewed with much suspense; Democrats held a one-seat Senate majority, and had Johnson died or resigned, Governor Mike Rounds would likely have appointed a Republican to Johnson&#x27;s seat, giving Republicans control of the Senate. Johnson returned to his full Senate schedule on September 5, 2007, to both tributes and standing ovations.

Johnson chose not to seek reelection in 2014.

===Committee assignments===

*Committee on Appropriations

==Political positions==
Johnson was considered a centrist Democrat.

===Infrastructure===
During his tenure in Congress, Johnson supported infrastructure projects that delivered clean drinking water to communities throughout South Dakota and into surrounding states. He authored several water project bills, resulting in clean drinking water being delivered to hundreds of thousands of South Dakota families.

During his first term in the House of Representatives, Johnson authored the Mni Wiconi Project Act of 1988 (H.R. 2772, enacted into law as Public Law 100–516). The measure authorized construction of a water project serving an area of southwestern South Dakota that included the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, an area that had long suffered low water supplies and poor water quality. In subsequent years, Johnson authored legislation (H.R. 3954) to expand the Mni Wiconi Rural Water Project service area, and the expansion was incorporated into a broader bill and enacted as Public Law 103-434.

Johnson&#x27;s Mid Dakota Rural Water System Act of 1991 (H.R. 616) was incorporated into a larger package of infrastructure projects and enacted into law as Public Law 102-575. The Mid Dakota Rural Water Project was completed in 2006 and serves more than 30,000 residents of east-central South Dakota.

The Fall River Rural Water Users District Rural Water System Act of 1998 (S. 744 in the 105th Congress, enacted as Public Law 105–352) authorized the Bureau of Reclamation to construct a rural water system in Fall River County of South Dakota. After years of drought, residents in the southeastern area of that county had been left without a suitable water supply, and many of them were forced to either haul water or use bottled water because of poor water quality. 

The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System Act of 1999 (S.244 in the 106th Congress) authorized construction of a water delivery system spanning a broad area of southeastern South Dakota, northwestern Iowa, and southwestern Minnesota. The system joined 22 rural water systems and communities.

The authorized project was intended to bring clean, safe drinking water to 180,000 individuals throughout the Lewis and Clark service region. The Perkins County Rural Water System Act (S.2117 in the 105th Congress and S.243 in the 106th Congress, enacted as Public Law 106–136) authorized the Bureau of Reclamation to construct a rural water system in Perkins County of South Dakota.

===Agriculture===

Johnson worked to enact a requirement that meat and other agricultural products be labeled for country of origin. Having first authored legislation addressing the issue in 1992 (H.R. 5855), Johnson continued the fight until a meat labeling law was enacted in 2002 as part of the Farm Bill reauthorization (Public Law 107–171). The enacted law contained language Johnson had introduced as S. 280 earlier that Congress.

For more than a decade, executive branch opposition and legal challenges delayed implementation of the labeling law.

In May 2007, Johnson received an &quot;Honored Cooperator&quot; award from the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) for his support of cooperative businesses.

In 2013, the National Farmers Union presented Johnson with its Friend of the Family Farmer award, an honor intended to recognize his commitment to helping small scale family farms remain viable.

===Tourism===
Johnson authored the bill establishing the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site in western South Dakota. The measure was enacted as Public Law 106–115, creating a new unit of the National Park System. At the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site, visitors can learn about the Cold War and the nuclear missiles that threatened massive destruction while also serving as a deterrent to war.

===Defense===
Johnson was the only seated member of Congress to have a son or daughter serving in the active duty military when the Senate voted to approve the use of force in Iraq. His oldest son, Brooks, served in the Army&#x27;s 101st Airborne Division, which would surely be mobilized to fight in Iraq. Johnson ultimately voted to permit the use of force, and his son served in Iraq, having already served in other conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo. Brooks Johnson later also served in the conflict in Afghanistan.

As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Johnson secured full and timely funding for veterans&#x27; health care for the first time in 21 years. He was among a group of legislators that successfully pressed for enactment of legislation providing advance funding for veterans&#x27; health care, thereby preventing health services for veterans from being undermined by funding delays.

When the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission recommended closure of Ellsworth Air Force Base, Johnson assisted in making the South Dakota delegation&#x27;s case to keep the base open. Ultimately, the base was preserved by an 8 to 1 vote of the BRAC commission.

===Banking===
As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Johnson pressed for confirmation and ultimately brought President Obama&#x27;s nominee for CFPB chairman, Richard Cordray, to a committee vote despite Republican opposition.

The committee approved Cordray&#x27;s nomination on a party-line 12–10 vote, and Cordray was ultimately confirmed by the full Senate on a 66-34 vote.

===Other===
In the House, Johnson was among the minority of his party to vote in favor of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996a welfare reform bill and another bill to repeal the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. He was among the minority of Democrats to vote for President George W. Bush&#x27;s 2001 tax cut. On January 31, 2006, Johnson was one of only four Democrats to vote to confirm Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court. He also called for &quot;broadened use&quot; of the death penalty.

Johnson was among the minority of senators to vote against the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which anti-abortion groups strongly supported. While a member of the House, he was one of only 16 congressmen to vote against the Telecom Act of 1996, which provided for deregulation and competition in the communication sector and was given firm support by Republicans, business groups, and most Democrats.

Johnson supported Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009 and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

In May 2010, Johnson introduced the Tony Dean Cheyenne River Valley Conservation Act of 2010, a bill that would designate over of the Buffalo Gap National Grassland as protected wilderness. The act would allow the continuation of grazing and hunting on the land and would create the first national grassland wilderness in the country.

On December 18, 2010, Johnson voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.

==Political campaigns==

=== South Dakota legislature ===
Johnson launched his political career in 1978, winning a seat in the South Dakota House of Representatives. He served in the House from 1979 until 1982. Johnson continued his legislative career by serving in the South Dakota Senate from 1983 to 1986. During this time, he also worked as Clay County deputy state&#x27;s attorney in 1985.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
Johnson was elected five times to represent South Dakota as the at-large member of the United States House of Representatives. He served from 1987 to 1997. During his tenure, Johnson worked on issues including agriculture, rural development, protecting Medicare and Social Security, and expanding access to healthcare.

=== 1996 U.S. Senate campaign ===
Johnson narrowly defeated three-term Senator Larry Pressler in the 1996 U.S. Senate election. This made him the only Senate candidate that year to defeat an incumbent in a general election, during a year that saw 13 open seats.

=== 2002 U.S. Senate reelection campaign ===
In 2002, Johnson was reelected by 524 votes over U.S. Representative John Thune, who had succeeded him in South Dakota&#x27;s at-large House seat. The race was widely seen as a proxy battle between President George W. Bush, who carried South Dakota comfortably in 2000, and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. Johnson won 94% of the vote among the Oglala Sioux, South Dakota&#x27;s largest tribe.

=== 2008 U.S. Senate reelection campaign ===

Johnson sought reelection in 2008 after recovering from a serious health condition. Early polls showed him likely to defeat Republican challenger Joel Dykstra, and he did, with 62.5% of the vote. In January 2008, Johnson endorsed Barack Obama for president in the Democratic primary.

==Electoral history==
*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1992, Ann Balakier received 2,780 votes.

==Personal life==
Johnson married the former Barbara Brooks in 1969. The couple had three children — Brooks, of Millis, MA; Brendan, the former U.S. Attorney for South Dakota; and Kelsey Billion of Sioux Falls, SD — and eight grandchildren. They lived in Sioux Falls.

===Illness and death===
Johnson was treated for prostate cancer in 2004 and further tests showed he was clear of the disease.

On December 13, 2006, in Washington, D.C., during the broadcast of a live radio interview, Johnson suffered bleeding in the brain caused by a cerebral arteriovenous malformation, a congenital defect that causes enlarged and tangled blood vessels. In critical condition, he underwent surgery at George Washington University Hospital to drain the blood and stop further bleeding.

Johnson then underwent a lengthy regimen of physical, occupational, and speech therapy to regain strength and mobility and restore his severely affected speech. He was left partially paralyzed on his right side, and had to use a scooter. In his 2007 State of the Union Address, President George W. Bush sent Johnson his best wishes. Johnson resumed his full schedule in the Senate on September 5, 2007.

Johnson died in Sioux Falls on October 8, 2024, at age 77, after having another stroke. His funeral service on October 18 at Our Savior’s Lutheran Church in Sioux Falls was attended by hundreds of people, including several politicians who had served with Johnson. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.

<doc id="339213" wikidata="Q131887" url="?curid=339213" title="Scutage">
<text>Scutage was a medieval English tax levied on holders of a knight&#x27;s fee under the feudal land tenure of knight-service. Under feudalism the king, through his vassals, provided land to knights for their support. The knights owed the king military service in return. The knights were allowed to &quot;buy out&quot; of the military service by paying scutage (a term derived from Latin &quot;scutum&quot;, &quot;shield&quot;).

As time passed the kings began to impose a scutage on holders of knight&#x27;s fees, whether or not the holder was actually a knight.

== General information ==
The institution existed under Henry I (reigned 1100–1135) and Stephen (reigned 1135–1154), when it occurs as &quot;scutagium&quot;, &quot;scuagium&quot; or &quot;escuagium&quot;. The creation of fractions of knights&#x27; fee probably hastened its introduction: the holders of such fractions could only discharge their obligation &quot;via&quot; scutage. The increasing use of mercenaries in the 12th century would also make a money payment of greater use to the crown.

Separate levies of scutage received the names of the campaigns for which they were raised, as &quot;the scutage of Toulouse&quot; (or &quot;great scutage&quot;), &quot;the scutage of Ireland&quot;, and so forth. The levy demanded from each fee one mark (13s. 4d., two thirds of a pound), one pound or two marks, but anything above a pound seemed abnormal until John (reigned 1199–1216) imposed levies of two marks in most years without even the excuse of a war. The irritation caused by these exactions reached a climax in 1214, when John demanded three marks. Taxation through scutage became a prominent cause among the many that led to the rebellion of 1215, which culminated in the proclamation of Magna Carta of 1215. Its provisions prohibited the crown from levying any scutage save by &quot;the common counsel of our realm&quot;. 

The reissued Charter of 1217 provided, instead of this, that scutage levies should remain at the rate as of the reign of Henry II. In practice, however, under Henry III (reigned 1216–1272), scutage rates usually amounted to three marks, but required the assent of the barons, and levies occurred only on adequate occasions.

Meanwhile, a practice had arisen, possibly as early as Richard I&#x27;s reign (1189–1199), of accepting from great barons special &quot;fines&quot; for permission not to serve in a campaign. This practice appears to have rested on the crown&#x27;s right to decide whether to exact personal service or to accept scutage &quot;in lieu&quot; of service. A system of special composition thus arose which largely replaced the old one of scutage. As between the tenants-in-chief, however, and their under-tenants, the payment of scutage continued. The terms of charters of subinfeudation, which specified the quota of scutage due rather than the proportion of a knight&#x27;s fee granted, often stereotyped scutage. For the purpose of recouping themselves by levying from their under-tenants, the tenants-in-chief received from the crown writs &quot;de scutagio habendo&quot;. Under Edward I (reigned 1272–1307) the new system developed so completely that the six levies of the reign, each as high as two pounds on the fee, applied in practice only to the under-tenants, their lords compounding with the crown by the payment of large sums, though their nominal assessment, somewhat mysteriously, became much lower (see Knight service).

Scutage rapidly became obsolescent as a source of revenue, Edward II (reigned 1307–1327) and Edward III (reigned 1327–1377) imposing only one levy each and relying on other more uniform and direct modes of taxation. The lengths to which subinfeudation had gone also hastened its rapid decay; increasing subinfeudation led to constant dispute and litigation as to which of the holders in the descending chain of tenure remained liable for the payment. Apart from its financial aspect it had possessed a legal importance as the test, according to Bracton, of tenure by knight-service, its payment, on however small a scale, proving the tenure to be &quot;military&quot; with all the consequences involved.

==Scholarship==
J. F. Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;The Scutage and Knight Service in England&quot; (1897), a dissertation printed at the University of Chicago Press, offers a major monograph on the subject (though not wholly free from error). Madox&#x27;s &quot;History of the Exchequer&quot; formerly formed the standard authority. J. H. Round in &quot;Feudal England&quot; (1895) first set forth a more modern view. In 1896 appeared the &quot;Red Book of the Exchequer&quot; (Rolls series), which, with the &quot;Book of Fees&quot; (Public Record Office) and the Pipe Rolls (published by the Record Commission and the Pipe Roll Society), provides the chief record authority on the subject; but the editor misdated many of the scutages, and JH Round in his &quot;Studies on the Red Book of the Exchequer&quot; (privately issued) and his &quot;Commune of London and other Studies&quot; (1899) severely criticized his conclusions. See also Pollock and Maitland&#x27;s &quot;History of English Law&quot; (1895) and McKechnie&#x27;s &quot;Magna Carta&quot; (1905). Scargill Bird&#x27;s &quot;Scutage and Marshal’s Rolls&quot; in &quot;Genealogist&quot; (1884), vol. i., has important coverage of later records.

<text>A value-added network (VAN) is a hosted service offering that acts as an intermediary between business partners sharing standards based on proprietary data via shared business processes. The offered service is referred to as &quot;value-added network services&quot;.

== 1960s: &quot;Timesharing&quot; and &quot;network&quot; service ==

Following in the wake of timesharing providers, provision of leased lines between terminals and data centers proved a sustainable business which led to the establishment of dedicated business units and companies specialized in the management and marketing of such network services. See Tymshare for an example of a timeshare services company that spun off Tymnet as a data communications specialist with a complex product portfolio.

== 1970s: Marketisation of telecommunication ==

The large-scale allocation of network services by private companies was in conflict with state-controlled telecommunications sector. To be able to gain a license for telecommunication service provision to customers, a private business had to &quot;add value&quot; to the communications line in order to be a distinguishable service. Therefore, the notion of &quot;value-added network services&quot; was established to allow for operation of such private businesses as an exemption from state control.

The telecommunication operator sector was marketed in the USA in 1982 (see Modification of Final Judgment) and in the United Kingdom starting with the early 1980s (mainly due to the privatization of British Telecom under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher). In the later 1980s, running a value-added network service required licensing in the U.K. while the term &quot;value-added network&quot; had merely become a functional description of a specific subset of networked data communication in the USA.

== Since 1980s: International competition and standardization efforts ==

On a multinational scale, and due to the heterogeneous telecommunication economy and infrastructure before the market penetration of the Internet, management of a value-added network service proved a complicated task leading to the idea of user-defined networks, a concept preceding the nowadays ubiquitous availability of internet service. Standardization efforts for data networking were made by ITU-T (formerly CCIT) and included X.25 packet-switched networks and X.400 message handling systems, specifically motivated by an emerging transatlantic competition in the early 1990s.

== Perspective ==

In the absence of state-operated telecommunication sector, value-added network services are still used, mainly as a functional description, in conjunction with dedicated leased lines for business-to-business communications (especially for EDIFACT data transfer).

Governments like South Africa still maintain explicit regulation, while others address specific services with licensing.

Traditionally, most value-added network services mainly supported general-purpose business-to-business integration capabilities focused on electronic data interchanges, but service providers are evolving to become more process- and industry-specific over time, particularly in industries such as retail and hi-tech manufacturing. Some sources suggest that modern value-added network services should be called &quot;trading grids&quot; due to commonalities with grid computing.
Others distinguish internet service providers from international value-added network services (IVANS) operators.

<doc id="339217" wikidata="Q1051710" url="?curid=339217" title="Goldenseal">
<text>Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), also called orangeroot or yellow puccoon, is a perennial herb in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae, native to North America. It may be distinguished by its thick, yellow knotted rootstock. The stem is purplish and hairy above ground and yellow below ground where it connects to the yellow rhizome. Goldenseal reproduces both clonally through the rhizome and sexually, with clonal division more frequent than asexual reproduction. It takes between 4 and 5 years for a plant to reach sexual maturity, i.e. the point at which it produces flowers. Plants in the first stage, when the seed erupts and cotyledons emerge, can remain in this state one or more years. The second vegetative stage occurs during years two and three (and sometimes longer) and is characterized by the development of a single leaf and absence of a well developed stem. Finally, the third stage is reproductive, at which point flowering and fruiting occurs. This last stage takes between 4 and 5 years to develop.

A second species from Japan, previously listed as &quot;Hydrastis palmatum&quot;, is now usually classified in another genus, as &quot;Glaucidium palmatum&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Hydrastis canadensis&quot; is a herbaceous perennial growing from a horizontal, yellowish rhizome that is thick with knobby knots. The finely hairy, upright, unbranched, stems grow to tall. Fertile plants have a single stem with two palmately lobed leaves. Flowering plants produce a single terminal flower with no petals and three sepals and 12 or more conspicuous white pistils; flowering occurs for a short time in spring. Fertilized flowers grow into red, raspberry-like fruits with one or two seeds.

=== Constituents and modern pharmacology ===
Goldenseal contains the isoquinoline alkaloids hydrastine, berberine, berberastine, hydrastinine, tetrahydroberberastine, canadine and canalidine. A related compound, 8-oxotetrahydrothalifendine, was identified in one study. The &quot;United States Pharmacopoeia&quot; requires goldenseal sold as a supplement to have hydrastine concentrations of at least 2% and berberine concentrations of at least 2.5%. The requirements in Europe are that hydrastine concentrations be at least 2.5% and that berberine concentrations at least 3%. The hydrastine concentrations of goldenseal plants range between 1.5% and 5%, while the berberine concentrations are usually between 0.5% and 4.5%. Goldenseal is harvested for its rhizomes because the concentrations of hydrastine and berberine in the shoots do not meet these requirements. Berberine and hydrastine act as quaternary bases and are poorly soluble in water but freely soluble in alcohol. The herb seems to have synergistic antibacterial activity over berberine &quot;in vitro&quot;, possibly as a result of efflux pump inhibitory activity.

==Distribution and habitat==
Found in southeastern Canada and the eastern United States, the plant grows in mesic forests under deciduous trees. It is found in sheltered ravines or on talus slopes. It seems to be intolerant of disturbances in the tree canopy and grazing. It can be found growing in association with other uncommon plants such as &quot;Jeffersonia diphylla&quot; (twinleaf) and &quot;Dicentra canadensis&quot; (squirrel corn).

==Conservation==

Goldenseal became popular in the mid-19th century. By 1905, the herb was much less plentiful because of overharvesting and habitat destruction. Roots of goldenseal are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), meaning a CITES permit to export is required. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommends that diggers and harvesters track sales and harvests and prove legality of all harvests.

Canada, as well as 17 of the 27 U.S. states where goldenseal grows natively, have declared it as threatened, vulnerable or uncommon. More than 60 million goldenseal plants are picked each year without being replaced. Although goldenseal&#x27;s geographical range is wide, it is found in small quantities in these habitats. The core of the herb&#x27;s range is in the Ohio River Valley, but its population there has decreased by almost half. The process of mountain top removal mining has recently put the wild goldenseal population at major risk from loss of habitat.

Many herbalists urge caution in choosing products containing goldenseal, as they may have been harvested in an unsustainable manner rather than having been organically cultivated.

There are several berberine-containing plants that can serve as useful alternatives, including Chinese coptis, yellowroot or Oregon grape root.

==Toxicity==
According to the American Cancer Society, &quot;Goldenseal can have toxic side effects, and high doses can cause death.&quot;

Side effects of goldenseal may include &quot;digestive complaints, nervousness, depression, constipation, rapid heartbeat, diarrhea, stomach cramps and pain, mouth ulcers, nausea, seizures, vomiting, and central nervous system depression. High doses may cause breathing problems, paralysis, and even death. Long-term use may lead to vitamin B deficiency, hallucinations, and delirium.&quot; In addition, goldenseal may cause brain damage to newborn babies if given directly or if taken by breastfeeding or pregnant mothers, and may affect blood pressure unpredictably because it contains several compounds that have opposite effects on blood pressure.

Taking goldenseal over a long period of time can reduce absorption of B vitamins, and it is cautioned to avoid goldenseal during pregnancy and lactation, with gastrointestinal inflammation and with pro-inflammatory disorders. A 2011 study found rats fed goldenseal constantly for two years had a greater tendency to develop tumors.

Goldenseal has been found to have inhibited cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 activity by approximately 40%, a statistically and clinically significant reduction. CYP2D6 is a known metabolizer of many commonly used pharmaceuticals, such as antidepressants (including all SSRIs except for fluvoxamine), neuroleptics, codeine, and Metformin. Combining goldenseal with such medications should be done with caution and under the supervision of a doctor as it can lead to serious, perhaps fatal, toxicity. Those with a genetic deficiency in these enzymes are at particular risk.

== Cultivation ==
As of 1998, only 2.4% of goldenseal plant material originated from a cultivated source rather than wild harvest, although that number was projected to rise by 15–30% over the next several years. In response to conservation concerns, research has expanded regarding the propagation success of wild plant material for commercial yield. Because goldenseal grows in patches of interconnected ramets reproducing asexually through clonal propagation, transplanting rhizome propagules into cultivated settings is possible. Seed propagation is also feasible and has advantages such as lower cost and greater genetic variability, but is considered difficult and unpredictable.

Goldenseal may be commercially cultivated through agroforestry in natural settings mirroring the plant&#x27;s ecological environment, or on farms with artificial shade canopies. Another propagation method of goldenseal utilizes a controlled environment such as a greenhouse growing lab where the plant&#x27;s environmental needs such as light, water and temperature are artificially simulated. Crop selection and biotechnology experimentation may be employed to increase yield and pharmacological potency. Controlled environments can greatly reduce the amount of time required to grow goldenseal to its desired harvestable state. While forest-cultivated plants double in mass every three to five years, plants can double in mass every 15 weeks in growth chambers and triple in growth when in a course soil medium. Subculturing can take place every 30 days to mass-propagate the plant.

Another option is cultivating goldenseal in new regions. An experiment conducted by Douglas et al. grew goldenseal over a six-year period in a warm, temperate environment in New Zealand. The yields were 74% higher in the sixth year of growth compared to the fourth year of growth, which is when goldenseal is normally harvested. The overall growth of the allochthonous goldenseal was comparable to that found in the United States, and the hydrastine and berberine concentrations were within the American and European standards. Cultivating goldenseal in a New Zealand environment that is similar to its home range is an option to maintain its population.

=== Research on harvest effects ===
Research completed by Albrecht and McCarthy shows that when goldenseal is harvested in the fall season, it has a faster population recovery than with midsummer harvests. However, a study by Douglas et al. showed that goldenseal has the highest concentrations of hydrastine and berberine in the early summer. Their research also showed that three to five years of growth will yield the highest concentration of alkaloids in the plant.

Two experiments done by Sinclair and Catling on the effects of soil turnover, fertilization and transplanting of goldenseal show that disturbances actually benefit the growth of goldenseal. The results from the first growing season of the experiment showed that soil turnover and fertilization combined show the greatest increase in plant biomass, while the results after two growing seasons showed that this group also yielded the highest proportion of flowering plants, fruit production and seed production. Both experiments also showed that soil disturbances benefit the growth of goldenseal.

== Uses ==

At the time of the European colonization of the Americas, goldenseal was in extensive use among certain Native American tribes of North America, both as a medicine and as a coloring material. In 1798, Benjamin Smith Barton referred to the Cherokee use of goldenseal as a cancer treatment; he called attention to its properties as a bitter tonic, and as a local wash for ophthalmia. It became a favorite of the Eclectics from the time of Constantine Raffinesque in the 1830s. Tribes also used goldenseal for digestive issues, as an eyewash, as a diuretic and as a bitter.

According to the American Cancer Society, &quot;Available scientific evidence does not support claims that goldenseal is effective in treating cancer or other diseases.&quot; According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, &quot;The scientific evidence does not support the use of goldenseal for any health-related purpose.&quot;

In the early 20th century, it was used as a yellow dye, astringent, and insect repellent.

<doc id="339220" wikidata="Q188128" url="?curid=339220" title="Alexei Abrikosov (physicist)">
<text>Alexei Alexeyevich Abrikosov (; June 25, 1928 – March 29, 2017) was a Soviet, Russian and American theoretical physicist whose main contributions are in the field of condensed matter physics. He was the co-recipient of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics, with Vitaly Ginzburg and Anthony James Leggett, for theories about how matter can behave at extremely low temperatures.

== Education and early life ==

Abrikosov was born in Moscow, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, on June 25, 1928, to a couple of physicians: Aleksey Abrikosov and Fani ( Wulf). His mother was Jewish. After graduating from high school in 1943, Abrikosov began studying energy technology. He graduated from Moscow State University in 1948. From 1948 to 1965, he worked at the Institute for Physical Problems of the USSR Academy of Sciences, where he received his Ph.D. in 1951 for the theory of thermal diffusion in plasmas, and then his Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (a &quot;higher doctorate&quot;) degree in 1955 for a thesis on quantum electrodynamics at high energies. Abrikosov moved to the US in 1991 and lived there until his death in 2017, in Palo Alto, California. While in the US, Abrikosov was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2000, and in 2001, to be a foreign member of the Royal Society.

==Career==
From 1965 to 1988, he worked at the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics (USSR Academy of Sciences). He has been a professor at Moscow State University since 1965. In addition, he held tenure at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology from 1972 to 1976, and at the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys from 1976 to 1991. He served as a full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences from 1987 to 1991. In 1991, he became a full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

In two works in 1952 and 1957, Abrikosov explained how magnetic flux can penetrate a class of superconductors. This class of materials are called type-II superconductors. The accompanying arrangement of magnetic flux lines is called the Abrikosov vortex lattice.

Together with Lev Gor&#x27;kov and Igor Dzyaloshinskii, Abrikosov has written an iconic book on theoretical solid-state physics, which has been used to train physicists in the field for decades.

From 1991 until his retirement, he worked at Argonne National Laboratory in the U.S. state of Illinois. Abrikosov was an Argonne Distinguished Scientist at the Condensed Matter Theory Group in Argonne&#x27;s Materials Science Division. When he received the Nobel Prize, his research was focused on the origins of magnetoresistance, a property of some materials that change their resistance to electrical flow under the influence of a magnetic field.

== Honours and awards ==
Abrikosov was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1966, the Fritz London Memorial Prize in 1972, and the USSR State Prize in 1982. In 1989 he received the Landau Prize from the Academy of Sciences, Russia. Two years later, in 1991, Abrikosov was awarded the Sony Corporation&#x27;s John Bardeen Award. The same year he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics. He was also a member of the Royal Academy of London, a fellow of the American Physical Society, and in 2000 was elected to the prestigious National Academy of Sciences. Other awards include:

* Member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (now Russian Academy of Sciences), 1964
* Honorary Doctor of the University of Lausanne, 1975
* Order of the Badge of Honour, 1975
* Order of the Red Banner of Labour, 1988
* Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (now Russian Academy of Sciences), 1987
* Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2001
* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, 2004
* Gold Medal of Vernadsky from National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, 2015
==Personal life==
Abrikosov was the son of the physicians Alexei Ivanovich Abrikosov (1875-1955) and his second wife, Fania Davidovna Woolf (1895—1965). Through his father, Abrikosov was the nephew of the martyred Catholic nun Anna Abrikosova (1882-1936).

His sister was Maria Alekseevna Abrikósova (1929-1998), physician.

He married Svetlana Yuriyevna Bunkova and had 3 children.

He died in California on 29 March 2017 at the age of 88.

<text>Moses Znaimer (; born 1942) is a Tajik-born Canadian media executive of Jewish descent. He is the co-founder and former head of Citytv, the first independent television station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and the current head of ZoomerMedia.

==Early life and education==
Znaimer was born to Jewish parents (Aron Znaimer and Chaya Znaimer née Epelsweig) from Latvia and Poland, who had fled the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union and relocated to Kulob in the Soviet republic of Tajikistan. Following the war, his family lived in a German Displaced Persons camp, arriving in Halifax before ultimately ending up in Montreal in 1948 where they settled in a third-floor flat on Montréal’s storied Saint Urbain Street.

In his youth, Znaimer attended United Talmud Torah and then Herzliah High School in the United Talmud Torahs of Montreal private school system, where he developed a reputation for the quality of his voice while performing Friday services. He has remarked that the young women flocking to hear him sing the prayers gave him a taste of what it is like to have groupies.

He graduated from McGill University in Montreal with a B.A. in philosophy and politics (and served as president of the McGill Debating Union), and from Harvard University with an M.A. in government in the mid-1960s.

==CBC==
Znaimer&#x27;s career in broadcasting began when he joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in the mid-1960s in Montreal and Ottawa. He became well known for his work as host of CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Cross Country Checkup&quot;, as well as co-host of CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Take 30&quot; with Adrienne Clarkson. After being denied the opportunity to pursue his creative vision at the CBC, Znaimer quit and went into private broadcasting.

==Citytv==
With all of the VHF television licences in Toronto taken, Znaimer and a partnership applied for and was awarded the city&#x27;s first UHF commercial broadcasting licence, on channel 79. Citytv launched in 1972, and changed frequency to channel 57 in 1983. With Citytv, he gradually began to pioneer a distinctive style of broadcasting, inspired in part by Marshall McLuhan, which emphasized a strongly local, hip and casual format aimed at young audiences.

In 1981, Toronto-based media conglomerate CHUM Limited purchased Citytv, and Znaimer became vice-president of CHUM and executive producer for all of City&#x27;s programming. By 1984 Znaimer&#x27;s vision of a 24-hour music video station was realized with the creation of MuchMusic. Much like City, MuchMusic emphasized the liveness and spontaneity of television, relying largely on hand-held cameras, and impromptu shots of VJs taken just about anywhere in the CHUM-City offices. MusiquePlus, a joint venture based in Montreal and catering to the French-speaking audiences of Canada, was launched in 1986. In 1987 CHUM-City purchased a former publishing building in Toronto&#x27;s downtown west end and renovated it into the CHUM-City Building, a landmark media centre.

Throughout the 1990s, Znaimer presided over a considerable expansion of the CHUM-City television empire. Bravo! was launched as a new style arts channel in 1995, and Space in 1997. He continued his original vision for television with the launching of Canada&#x27;s first 24-hour local news station, CablePulse 24 in 1998. Further cable channels included Canadian Learning Television, Star!, Drive-In Classics, FashionTelevisionChannel, BookTelevision, CourtTV Canada, SexTV: The Channel, MuchLOUD and MuchVibe. Znaimer also oversaw the launch of Citytv Vancouver.

Znaimer left Citytv and CHUM Limited in April 2003, but stayed on in certain production roles. He co-founded and for a time served as chairman of Cannasat Therapeutics, a publicly traded company pioneering a new class of drugs from marijuana; he continues as a shareholder and advisor to the company.

Ultimately, CHUM Limited was acquired in 2007 by CTVglobemedia and the Citytv stations (including CITY and CKVU) are now owned by Rogers Media.

==ZoomerMedia==
In 2006, Moses Znaimer filed an application with the CRTC to acquire CFMX-FM, a commercial classical music radio station licensed to Cobourg with a rebroadcaster in Toronto. In 2008 he gained CRTC approval to relaunch the Toronto rebroadcaster as a full-fledged station, using the call sign CFMZ-FM to reflect his initials. In September 2007, he announced a deal to acquire CHWO, a pop standards AM station in Toronto. The station had operated from the former transmitter of CBC Radio outlet CBL, allowing it to blanket most of the eastern half of North America at night and much of the Great Lakes region and northern United States during the day. Znaimer officially took control of the station in 2008 and rechristened it CFZM. In addition to pop standards, it also offers news and some public-service talk programming, primarily aimed at the Toronto and southern Ontario market region, as well as a weeknight hour devoted to rebroadcasting classic radio dramatic and dramatic shows, usually programs first produced for the U.S. networks between the late 1930s and the late 1950s.

He also announced a subsequent deal to acquire web developer Fifty-Plus Net International, with the intention of launching a social networking website similar to MySpace or Facebook but aimed at older adults.

In 2008, Znaimer officially incorporated ZoomerMedia to operate his new media holdings. In June 2009, the company announced a deal to acquire the media assets of S-VOX, which operated several channels of religiously-oriented television programming, for $25 million.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Znaimer received a Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts, for his lifetime contributions to broadcasting. In 2006, he was made a member of the Order of Ontario.

Moses has been in a relationship with Marilyn Lightstone since they met at McGill University in the early 1960s. They never had children. 

An avid collector of vintage television sets, including the set David Sarnoff presented at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, Znaimer&#x27;s MZTV Museum of Television is located at The ZoomerPlex (ZoomerMedia building), in the Liberty Village area of Toronto.

<doc id="339229" wikidata="Q6524607" url="?curid=339229" title="Leon Day">
<text>Leon Day (October 30, 1916 – March 13, 1995) was an American professional baseball pitcher who spent the majority of his career in the Negro leagues. Recognized as one of the most versatile athletes in the league during his prime, Day could play every position, with the exception of catcher, and often was the starting second baseman or center fielder when he was not on the mound. A right-handed pitcher with a trademark no wind-up delivery, Day excelled at striking batters out, especially with his high-speed fastball. At the same time, he was an above-average contact hitter, which, combined with his effectiveness as a baserunner and his tenacious fielding, helped cement Day as one of the most dynamic players of the era.

Debuting in the Negro leagues in 1934, Day played with the Baltimore Black Sox, Newark Eagles, and Baltimore Elite Giants during his career. In 1937, Day had the best season of his career as a member of the Eagles, finishing with a perfect record of 13–0 and a batting average over .300. Day also played Puerto Rican winter ball in the offseasons. He holds both the Negro and Puerto Rican league records for strikeouts in a game, and appeared in the most East–West All-Star Games.

Because of his soft-spoken demeanor, Day&#x27;s accomplishments were not immediately recognized as opposed to other elite pitchers of the league like Satchel Paige. Nonetheless, Day is considered one of the best pitchers of the Negro leagues, equaling and sometimes surpassing the abilities of his rivals. In 1995, Day was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame, just six days before his death at 78 years old.

== Early life ==

Day was born to glass factory worker Ellis Day and his wife Hattie Leet in Alexandria, Virginia, a city seven miles from Washington, D.C., on October 30, 1916. His family, which included five other siblings, moved the following year to Mount Winans, a predominantly black community in a poor area of Southwest Baltimore, in a residence situated on Pierpont Street that lacked electricity and indoor plumbing. At a young age, Day became enamored with baseball, often playing local sandlot games or taking the long walk from his neighborhood to Maryland Ball Park where he watched the Baltimore Black Sox.

Day participated in Mount Winans Athletic Club when he was 12 and 13 years old. Because his campus did not offer a baseball program, in 1933, at 17 years old, Day dropped out of Frederick Douglass High School to join the semi-professional team the Silver Moons. With the club, he was predominantly a second baseman, &quot;but if the pitcher got in trouble&quot;, recollected Day, &quot;I&#x27;d say &#x27;Give me the ball&#x27;&quot;.

== Baseball career ==
=== Negro leagues ===
Day was discovered by Herbert &quot;Rap&quot; Dixon, a former Negro leagues baseball player and manager of the Black Sox, who took notice of his exceptional fielding and pitching abilities. In early 1934, Day was signed to a professional baseball contract worth $60 per month, gaining valuable insight during the season from his teammate Lamon Yokeley. However, due to the financial instability of the organization, the Black Sox disbanded at the end of the year. Day, Dixon, Yokeley, and other high-profile teammates subsequently signed with the Brooklyn Eagles in 1935. There, Day was mentored on his pickoff move by pitcher Ted &quot;Double Duty&quot; Radcliffe. The Eagles&#x27; general manager, Ben Taylor, sensed potential in the promising prospect and incorporated Day into the starting rotation. His first regular season on the mound, Day finished with a 9–2 record, highlighted by a one-hitter, and earned his first of seven East–West All-Star Game appearances.

In 1936, Day was recognized as the ace of the recently relocated Newark Eagles pitching staff, bringing &quot;a lot of intangibles to his game—his tenacity in going after hitters, his speed and quickness in fielding the ball, and his dedication to the game&quot;, as Day&#x27;s teammate of five years Max Manning recalled. His best season in the Negro leagues came in 1937, when Day was backed by the vaunted &quot;million-dollar infield&quot; consisting of Ray Dandridge, Willie Wells, Dick Seay, and Mule Suttles. Though just 5-foot-9 inches, Day delivered a 90–95 mph fastball. The pitch was deceptively fast because Day delivered with no windup, and threw the competition off-balance with his pinpoint accurate curveball. Day posted a perfect 13–0 season, coupled by a 3.02 earned run average (ERA), .320 batting average, and eight home runs. When he was not active on the mound, Day at one point or another played at every position, with the exception of catcher, and was a dangerous bat in the line-up, excelling to such an extent that Day drew comparisons to Babe Ruth&#x27;s legendary batting talent. Some writers like Daniel Nathan and Thomas Kern even argue that Day should have been a full-time outfielder to have his bat in the line-up every game.

On July 31, 1942, Day set a Negro league record for strikeouts in a single game, striking out 18 batters from the Baltimore Elite Giants in a one-hit shutout. The only hit manufactured against Day that outing was a bloop single to left field off the bat of &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Butts. In the 1942 East-West All-Star Game, with runners threatening in the seventh inning, Day entered in relief to strike out seven batters, the most recorded by a pitcher in an East-West All-Star appearance. Although the Newark Eagles failed to secure the Negro National League pennant that season, Day still participated in the Negro League World Series thanks to an odd transaction. After dropping the first three games, the Homestead Grays acquired Day on loan from the Eagles. He bested his rival Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs in a 4–1 Game Four victory. In response to the upset, the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, one of the most respected newspapers covering the Negro leagues, ranked Day ahead of Paige as the best pitcher in the league in 1942 and 1943. For his performance, Day was rewarded with $100 and a train ride back to Baltimore. The outcome of the game was thrown out on appeal by the Monarchs, however, for the Grays&#x27; use of unauthorized players. Without Day, the replay of the game was won by the Monarchs, sealing the series sweep.

=== World War II ===

On September 1, 1943, Day was drafted into military service. He entered into active service on September 22, 1943. He eventually served in the 818th Amphibian Battalion and landed on Utah Beach six days after Operation Overlord to drop supplies. Following VE-Day, he was stationed in France. Day and fellow Negro leaguer Willard Brown were recruited to the Overseas Invasion Service Expedition (OISE) All-Stars; Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Sam Nahem was the player-manager of the team. The team easily overcame the competition to reach the ETO World Series to face the 71st Infantry Division team, composed predominantly of Major League Baseball players. By contrast, the OISE club consisted of a mismatched roster of various minor leaguers, Negro leaguers, and semi-professionals. Before a crowd of 50,000 at Stadion Nürnberg in Germany, Day pitched in Game Two for a 2–1 victory as the OISE All-Stars eventually won the championship in five games. Day&#x27;s date of separation from the Army was March 14, 1946. His honorable discharge lists his military occupational specialty as Amphibian Truck Driver (934), his decorations and citations as the European-African-Middle-Eastern (EAME) Service Medal and the WWII Victory Medal, and his final rank as Technician 5th Grade (Tec 5). It also lists his height as 5&#x27;10&quot; and his weight as 180 pounds.

=== Return to baseball ===

Following his discharge from the military, Day returned to the Eagles in time for Opening Day on May 5, 1946. Despite not having pitched professionally for so long, he threw a no-hitter against the Philadelphia Stars in a 2–0 victory, allowing just three base runners via a walk and two errors charged to his teammates. Hampered by a lingering arm injury, Day nonetheless led the league that season in wins, strikeouts, and complete games. That same year, in the Negro League World Series, he pitched in two games as the Eagles edged the Monarchs in seven games, winning the championship. He played his final season in the Negro leagues in 1949 with the Baltimore Elite Giants. Record keeping was poor during Day&#x27;s career; partial statistics credit him with a 67–29 record, but league historians claim he won as many as 300 games.

=== Other leagues ===

During the 1935 offseason, Day traveled to Puerto Rico to participate in the country&#x27;s winter ball league. Beginning with his first trip in 1935, he played six seasons of winter ball in Puerto Rico, spending most of his time with the Aguadilla Sharks.

Much as with the Negro leagues, records of games were poorly documented, but some statistics show Day went 34–26 in his career with the team, and he established the league&#x27;s record for most strikeouts in a game, posting 19 in 1939.

In 1940, Day spent parts of the winter playing in the Venezuelan League, and for the Veracruz Red Eagles of the Mexican Baseball League, where he finished the season with a record of 6–0.

He returned to the Mexican League in 1947 and 1948 for the financial remuneration, however, comparatively speaking, the venture was unsuccessful for Day, who finished with a combined record of 18–20 and a 4.00 ERA.

Following his departure from the Negro leagues in 1950, Day spent a season with the semi-professional Winnipeg Buffalos of the Mandak League. Finally, in 1951 Day made his debut in organized baseball, albeit in the minors, with the Toronto Maple Leafs, a Triple-A club where Day tallied a 1–1 record with a 1.58 ERA through 14 games. Lastly, Day also played for two other Class-A teams in the St. Louis Browns farm system, the Scranton Miners and the Edmonton Eskimos, before retiring from professional baseball in 1955 at age 39.

== Later life and legacy ==

In his post-baseball career, Day worked as a bartender in Newark before returning to his hometown in Baltimore in 1970, where he held a position as a security guard until 1979. Before Day&#x27;s death in 1995, there were numerous efforts to celebrate his career and induct Day into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, a long-time dream of his. One such effort was made by Mayor Kurt Schmoke who declared January 31, 1992, Leon Day&#x27;s Day in Baltimore. Governor William Donald Schaefer made a similar proclamation for Annapolis later that same year on May 10. Day threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Pat Borders at the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Day&#x27;s discreet demeanor and humble personality often understated his several accomplishments, most likely leading to him being overlooked by the Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s voting committee. After falling short one vote of being inducted in 1993, Day was elected to the Hall of Fame on March 7, 1995. Six days later, Day died of heart failure while in hospice at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore; he was 78 years old.

Impossible to ignore was Day&#x27;s disparity to his rival, Paige. Historians have noted that Paige had a boisterous approach compared to Day&#x27;s reserved demeanor; Paige was tall and Day was short and slender; and Paige worked hard to promote his name while Day shied away from attention. The pitchers&#x27; infrequent head-to-head matchups led to remarkable pitching duels, three of which Day won.

Posthumous efforts were designed to honor Day. Baltimore renamed a west city park in 1997, refurbished with a baseball field and a sign welcoming visitors to &quot;Negro League Hall of Famer Leon Day Park&quot;. Day&#x27;s widow, Geraldine, established the Leon Day Foundation in 2001 to sponsor organized sports and preserve the cultural significance of the Negro leagues.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Day as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army during World War II.

<text>The Pacific Palisades Conservation Area is a conservation area located along the Meramec River where St. Louis, Jefferson, and Franklin counties meet in Missouri, USA. It is named for the rock and sand formations along this portion of the Meramec River. The LaBarque Creek Conservation Area is about to the south.

Pacific Palisades Conservation Area is a tract between St. Louis and Jefferson counties. The area is divided into a wildlife area in Jefferson County and an access area, in St. Louis County. River access is only available from the St. Louis county section. Hunting is allowed only in the Jefferson County section.

The access area is located in St. Louis county west of Eureka on Franklin Road. The access area hosts a Meramec River access and is on the north shore of the Meramec River.

The wildlife area is in Jefferson County, off English Road, south of Pacific, Missouri. The wildlife area has a diverse ecology with two lakes, of forest, of prairie, of field, of cropland, a once-prominent ramp, and large bluffs along south bank of the Meramec River.

The area is good for hunting deer, turkey, and doves. Herons and other waterfowl typically nest around the lakes. Large number of mussel beds are also located along this section of the Meramec River. Game fish species include bluegill, largemouth bass, and crappie.

<text>The mark was a currency or unit of account in many states. It is named for the mark unit of weight.

== England and Scotland ==
In England the &quot;mark&quot; never appeared as a coin but was only a unit of account. It was apparently introduced in the 10th century by the Danes. According to 19th century sources, it was initially equivalent to 100 pence, but after the Norman Conquest (1066), it was worth 160 pence (13 shillings and 4 pence), two-thirds of a pound sterling.

In Scotland, the merk Scots was a silver coin, issued first in 1570 and afterwards in 1663. It was originally worth 13 &quot;s.&quot; 6 &quot;d.&quot;, later increased to 14 &quot;s.&quot;.

== Germany ==

=== Early use ===
Originally, denoted a mass unit of approximately . The mark used in the market of Cologne (Cologne mark: ) was used to define the value of the official gold and silver currencies of the Holy Roman Empire including the Reichsthaler silver coin. In 1566, a Reichsthaler was introduced of which 9 were to be minted from a Cologne mark of fine silver. 
In northern Germany (especially Hamburg and Lübeck) as well as in much of trade in the Baltic region, the customary unit of account was the mark valued at of a Reichsthaler. Marks were rarely minted, though. Instead, &quot;schilling&quot; coins were minted with 48 schillings representing one Reichsthaler; i.e. 16 schillings equaled one mark.

In an attempt to prevent debasement of the currency by the influx of adulterated coins, the Hamburger Bank was founded in 1619. It was modeled after the example of the Bank of Amsterdam. Both these banks established a stable money of account. The Hamburg unit of account was the mark banco. It was credited in exchange for the sale of bullion or by way of credit against collateral. No coins or banknotes were issued, but accounts were opened showing a credit balance. The account holders could use their credit balances by remittances to other accounts or by drawing bills of exchange against them. These bills circulated and could be transferred by endorsement, and were accepted as payment. They could also be redeemed. This currency proved to be very stable.

=== 19th century ===
Following German unification in 1871, the country adopted the German gold mark (officially known just as the &quot;mark&quot;) as its currency in 1873. The name was taken from the mark banco. Initially, the coins and banknotes of the various predecessor currencies, such as the , the , and the guilder, continued to circulate, and were treated as fixed multiples of the new unit of account, similarly to the introduction period of the euro between 1999 and 2002. Coins denominated in gold marks were first issued in 1871, and gradually replaced the old coins. The mark banco was converted into the new gold mark at par. The Bank of Hamburg was incorporated as the Hamburg subsidiary into the newly founded (established 1876), issuing banknotes denominated in gold marks.

=== 20th century ===

In 1914 the stopped demanding first-class collateral (e.g. good bills of exchange, covered bonds such as &quot;&quot;) when providing credit to borrowers. The gold mark became a weak currency, colloquially referred to as the paper mark (), to finance the war effort. In 1918, the pre-war sound money policy was not re-established, and the continuing loose money policy resulted in inflation, and in 1923, in hyperinflation.

In late 1923 when the paper mark had become virtually worthless, it was replaced by a new currency, the (worth 1 trillion ). The new currency was issued by the newly established as credit to borrowers, but requiring collateral in the form of first-class claims to real estate.

In 1924 the stopped providing unrestricted credit against worthless financial bills, and pegged its new currency, the , to the stable . The rationed its lending, so that the remained at par with the stable . The currencies continued to exist in parallel, and were both abbreviated RM.

The original intention was to withdraw the by 1934, but the National Socialist government decided to continue to use the , which enjoyed a considerable trust due to its stability. Nevertheless, the National Socialist government deliberately overissued both currencies to finance infrastructure investments by the state, and expanded government employment and expenditure on items such as armaments. By 1935, laws limiting increases of prices, wages, and rents were needed to suppress inflation. Enormous extra taxes, charged on real estate owners ( in 1936), and on the occasion of the anti-Semitic November Pogrom (&quot;&quot;), on Jewish Germans ( in 1938), could not stabilise the economy for long. The start of World War II was used to justify general price controls and rationing. Thus inflation was officially hidden, and was expressed as ever-growing aggregate savings of the population, which could only spend its earnings on limited rations of goods at artificially low prices. However, inflation could clearly be seen in the rising prices on the black market. During the war, the German economy was supported by war booty taken from occupied countries, continuing to some extent until 1944. By the end of the war, the oversupply of banknotes and coins ( in 1933, in 1945) became obvious, openly showing up in inflated black market prices.

From 1944 the Allies printed occupation marks (also called &quot;military marks&quot;), decreeing that these were to be accepted at par with the and the . Banknotes worth military marks were issued for purchases by the occupying forces in Germany, and for soldiers&#x27; wages. In June 1948, military marks were demonetised as part of the West German and East German currency reforms.

In June 1947 the French occupying force in the Saar Protectorate introduced the Saar mark, which was at par with the and the . In November 1947, it was replaced by the Saar franc.

On 21 June 1948 the Deutsche Mark (German mark) was introduced by the &quot;&quot; in the western zones of occupation in Germany, which then formed West Germany.

On 23 June 1948 the &#x27; (&quot;German bank of issue and giro centre&quot;) of the Soviet occupation zone (which later formed East Germany) followed suit, issuing its own (colloquially referred to as the East German mark or &#x27;), later officially called &#x27; (1964–1967) and then &#x27; (1968–1990). It was replaced by the (West) German mark when Germany was reunified in 1990.

=== Replacement by the euro ===

The German mark was replaced by the euro, first as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, at a conversion rate of 1.95583 marks per euro. Thereafter, the mark-denominated notes and coins represented the euro at that conversion rate, and remained legal tender until 1 January 2002, when they were replaced by euro notes and coins.

Germany mints its own German euro coins, but all euro coins are legal tender throughout the Eurozone.

The remaining convertible mark of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a currency that officially replaced the German mark as de facto currency of the ruptured economy and hyper-inflation of local divided currencies after the Bosnian war, pegged to the German mark 1:1 at the time, and further pegged to Euro at the rate at which German mark was replaced, i.e. 1 EUR = 1.95583 BAM.

<text>Sweethearts is an operetta or musical play in two acts with music by Victor Herbert, lyrics by Robert B. Smith and book by Harry B. Smith and Fred de Gresac.

==Productions==
The first performance of the work was at the Academy of Music in Baltimore in March 1913, after which the show was overhauled and shortened before spending five weeks in Philadelphia and another five in Boston tryouts. The original Broadway production opened at the New Amsterdam Theatre on September 8, 1913 and transferred to the Liberty Theatre on November 10, 1913 running for a total of 136 performances. The original cast included Christie MacDonald as Princess Jeanne/Sylvia, Thomas Conkey as Prince Franz, Edwin Wilson as Lieutenant Karl, Frank Belcher as Petrus Von Tromp, Tom McNaughton as Mikel Mikeloviz, Ethel Du Fre Houston as Dame Paula, and Hazel Kirk as Liane.

There was a brief revival at Jolson&#x27;s 59th Street Theatre, opening on September 21, 1929 and closing on October 5, 1929. Gladys Baxter played Sylvia. MGM made the musical into a film in 1938 with a screenplay considerably altered from the musical&#x27;s book, directed by W. S. Van Dyke and starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. This was the first all-Technicolor film of MGM Studio.

A Broadway revival opened at the Shubert Theater on January 21, 1947 and ran for 288 performances. It featured a revised book by John Cecil Holm and musical direction by Robert Russell Bennett. The cast included Bobby Clark as Mikel, Marjorie Gateson as Dame Lucy, Gloria Story as Princess Sylvia and June Knight as Liane.

The piece was presented in the 1980s by the Light Opera of Manhattan. In 2002 the Ohio Light Opera commissioned a new critical edition of the operetta from Quade Winter, based on the composer&#x27;s original manuscripts in the Library of Congress. A complete recording was issued by Albany Records.

==Synopsis==
Mikel Mikeloviz, disguised as a monk, transports Princess Jeanne, the infant daughter of King René of the little kingdom of Zilinia, to Bruges to wait in safety during the war. Dame Paula runs the Laundry of the White Geese and is known as Mother Goose. Mikel gives the princess to Paula in secret to raise as her own daughter under the name of Sylvia. Paula later has six daughters of her own who help her run the laundry. Their father has been at war for ten years.

22 years later, the people are demanding the restoration of a monarchy. Mikel is conspiring to restore Princess Jeanne to the throne, which is about to be offered to Prince Franz, the heir presumptive. Franz, while travelling in disguise, has fallen in love with Sylvia. But Sylvia, who does not know that she is really a princess, is bethrothed to Lieutenant Karl, a military lothario. A sleazy politician, disguised as Paula&#x27;s battle-scarred husband, tries to ensnare one of the two apparently adopted daughters as the bride for Prince Franz, but he does not know whether the real adopted daughter is the scheming Liane or the sweet Sylvia. Mikel&#x27;s plans are hindered by the schemes of three villains. Mikel also mistakes Liane, a milliner who has sought temporary employment in the Laundry of the White Geese, for the lost princess. After all the complications are combed out, Franz and Sylvia marry, vowing to rule together.

==Recording==
RCA Victor issued an album using studio singers and Al Goodman&#x27;s orchestra on 78-RPM records in 1947. These highlights were issued on Lp by RCA Victor in 1951 and on their budget label RCA Camden in 1958. A 2008 CD release combines these recordings with selections from &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; and &quot;The Red Mill&quot;.

<text>The meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) is a small passerine bird, which breeds in much of the Palearctic, from southeastern Greenland and Iceland east to just east of the Ural Mountains in Russia, and south to central France and Romania; an isolated population also occurs in the Caucasus Mountains. It is migratory over most of its range, wintering in southern Europe, North Africa, and south-western Asia, but is resident year-round in western Europe, though even here many birds move to the coast or lowlands in winter.

The meadow pipit was formally described by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Alauda pratensis&quot;. The type locality is Sweden. The meadow pipit is now the type species of the genus &quot;Anthus&quot; that was introduced in 1805 by German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein. The species is monotypic; no subspecies are recognised.

The generic name &quot;Anthus&quot; is the Latin name for a small bird of grasslands mentioned by Pliny the Elder, and the specific name &quot;pratensis&quot; means &quot;of a meadow &quot;, from &quot;pratum&quot;, &quot;meadow&quot;. The name &quot;pipit&quot;, first documented by Thomas Pennant in 1768, is onomatopoeic, from the call note of this species. Old folk names, no longer used, include &quot;chit lark&quot;, &quot;peet lark&quot;, &quot;tit lark&quot;, and &quot;titling&quot;; these refer to its small size and superficial similarity to a lark.

==Description==

This is a widespread and often abundant small pipit, long and weight. It is an undistinguished-looking species on the ground, mainly brown above and buff below, with darker streaking on most of its plumage; the tail is brown, with narrow white side edges. It has a thin bill and pale pinkish-yellow legs; the hind claw is notably long, longer than the rest of the hind toes. The call is a weak &quot;tsi-tsi&quot;. The simple repetitive song is given in a short song flight. Birds breeding in Ireland and western Scotland are slightly darker coloured than those in other areas, and are often distinguished as the subspecies &quot;A. p. whistleri&quot;, though it intergrades clinally with nominate &quot;A. p. pratensis&quot; found in the rest of the species&#x27; range.

It is similar to the red-throated pipit &quot;A. cervinus&quot;, which is more heavily streaked and (in summer only) has an orange-red throat, and to the tree pipit &quot;A. trivialis&quot;, which is slightly larger, less heavily streaked, and has stronger facial markings and a shorter hind claw. The song of the meadow pipit accelerates towards the end while that of the tree pipit slows down.

==Distribution and habitat==

It is primarily a species of open habitats, either uncultivated or low-intensity agriculture, such as pasture, bogs, and moorland, but also occurs in low numbers in arable croplands. In winter, it also uses saltmarshes and sometimes open woodlands. It is a fairly terrestrial pipit, always feeding on the ground, but uses elevated perches such as shrubs, fence lines, or electricity wires as vantage points to watch for predators.

The estimated total population is 12 million pairs. It is an abundant species in the north of its range, and generally the commonest breeding bird in most of upland Britain, but less common further south. Breeding densities range from in northern Scandinavia, to in grassland in the south of the breeding range, and just in arable farmland. A few isolated breeding pairs are recorded from south of the main range, in the mountains of Spain, Italy, and the northern Balkans. A general decline in the population has occurred over the past 17 years, most notable in French farmland, with a 68% drop.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===

The nest is on the ground hidden in dense vegetation, with two to seven (most often three to five) eggs; the eggs hatch after 11–15 days, with the chicks fledging 10–14 days after hatching. Two broods are commonly raised each year. This species is one of the most important nest hosts of the cuckoo, and it is also an important prey species for merlins and hen harriers.

===Food and feeding===
Its food is primarily insects and other invertebrates, mostly small items less than long. It also eats the seeds of grasses, sedges, rushes, and heather, and crowberry berries, mainly in winter.

<doc id="339244" wikidata="Q948290" url="?curid=339244" title="Lame duck (politics)">
<text>In politics, a lame duck or outgoing politician is an elected official whose successor has already been elected or will be soon. An outgoing politician is often seen as having less influence with other politicians due to their limited time left in office. Conversely, a lame duck is free to make decisions that exercise the standard powers with little fear of consequence, such as issuing executive orders, pardons, or other controversial edicts. Lame duck politicians result from term limits, planned retirement, or electoral losses, and are especially noticeable where political systems build in a delay between the announcement of results and the taking of office by election winners. Even at the local level, politicians who do not seek re-election can lose credibility and influence. Uncompleted projects may fall to the wayside as their influence diminishes.

== Description ==
The status can be due to:
* having lost a re-election bid
* choosing not to seek another term, which would start at the expiration of the current term
* a term limit which prevents the official from running for that particular office again
* the abolition of the office, which must nonetheless be served out until the end of the official&#x27;s term.

Since these politicians do not face the consequences of their actions in an upcoming election, they have greater freedom to issue unpopular decisions or appointments. Examples include last-minute midnight regulations issued by executive agencies of outgoing US presidential administrations and executive orders issued by outgoing presidents. Such actions date back to the Judiciary Act of 1801 (&quot;Midnight Judges Act&quot;), in which Federalist President John Adams and the outgoing 6th Congress amended the Judiciary Act to create more federal judge seats for Adams to appoint and the Senate to confirm before the Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson was inaugurated and the Democratic-Republican majority 7th Congress convened.

In more recent history, US President Bill Clinton was widely criticized for issuing 140 pardons and other acts of executive clemency on his last day in office, including two former close colleagues, donors, fellow Democratic members, and his own half-brother.

In many countries, toward the facilitation of a smooth transition, an outgoing president accepts advice from and consults with the president-elect.

== Origins of the term ==
Literally, the term refers to a duck that is unable to keep up with the rest of its flock, making it a target for predators. 

The first time the phrase is known to have been used in its metaphorical sense was in the 18th century; it was used at the London Stock Exchange to refer to a stockbroker who defaulted on his debts. In 1761, Horace Walpole wrote, in a letter to Sir Horace Mann: &quot;Do you know what a Bull and a Bear and Lame Duck are?&quot; And in 1791, Mary Berry wrote that the Duchess of Devonshire&#x27;s loss of in stocks was &quot;the conversation of the town,&quot; and that her name was to be &quot;posted up as a lame duck&quot;.

The first known use of the term to refer to politicians is in the January 14, 1863, issue of the &quot;Congressional Globe&quot; (which was at the time the official record of the proceedings of the United States Congress): &quot;In no event ... could [the Court of Claims] be justly obnoxious to the charge of being a receptacle of &#x27;lame ducks&#x27; or broken down politicians.&quot;

== Examples ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, regardless of when the election is held, the Senate (upper house) sits from July 1 following the election to June 30 six years later, while the newly elected members of the House of Representatives (lower house) take their seats soon after an election. A Senate that is destined to lose its majority as a result of such a change is called a &quot;lame-duck Senate&quot; and often attracts criticism if it blocks government measures introduced in the House of Representatives.

For example, after the 2004 election, it became clear that the governing Liberal Party/National Party coalition would gain a majority in the new Senate, which was due to sit the following July. In May, some months after the elections but before the new Senate came to power, the old Senate refused to pass new tax laws that had been passed by the House, which served to merely delay the passage of those laws until the new Senate assembled.

In the 2010 Australian federal election, Senator Steve Fielding of the minor party Family First lost his seat and subsequently threatened to block supply if the Labor Party was successful in forming a minority government.

=== Canada ===
Unlike in some countries, there is no &quot;lame duck&quot; session of Parliament in Canada between the general election and swearing in of the new Parliament. In almost all cases, the outgoing prime minister or premier hands over power directly to their designated successor after a few weeks at most after a general election or shortly after a leadership election.

Usually, when the leader of a ruling party steps down, they also relinquish their caucus leadership role at around the same time, so there is no need for an interim caucus leader. The power of outgoing Canadian parliamentarians is limited. Instead the departing prime minister or premier and cabinet ministers that were members of the now dissolved parliament will serve in an &quot;acting&quot; or &quot;caretaker&quot; capacity (i.e. not being able to make important appointments nor policy declarations) until the new parliament convenes; in one example when Sir Charles Tupper attempted to make appointments after losing the 1896 Canadian election the Governor General refused to act on this.

A notable exception to the above is the transition between William Lyon Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent, making it perhaps the only lame duck example in Canadian federal politics. After resigning the leadership of the Liberals, King became parliamentary leader and continued as Prime Minister of Canada for some months following the leadership election of his successor, St. Laurent, who became party leader but continued as a member of King&#x27;s cabinet during this time.

While Pierre Trudeau retired from politics in 1984, he directly handed power over to John Turner after the leadership contest. However, Trudeau recommended that Governor General Jeanne Sauvé appoint over 200 Liberals to well-paying patronage positions, including Senators, judges, and executives on various governmental and crown corporation boards, widely seen as a way to offer &quot;plum jobs&quot; to loyal party members. These appointments generated a severe backlash across the spectrum. Turner had the right to recommend that the appointments be cancelled: advice that Sauvé would have been required to follow by constitutional convention. However, he let them stand and made a further 70 appointments himself. Turner refused to produce a written agreement he had made with Trudeau before taking office, documenting a secret deal that saw Trudeau step down early. This is seen by many as Trudeau attempting to exercise some lame duck influence before resigning as Prime Minister.

=== Netherlands ===
Following the collapse of a cabinet, the concurrent prime minister will usually stay as the leader of the caretaker government, until the beginning of the next term. After a potential election loss, it is custom to resign as the party leader, but remain the &quot;lame duck&quot; prime minister of the caretaker cabinet until the next cabinet is inaugurated.

As of July 2023, prime minister Mark Rutte announced his resignation and retirement from politics following the collapse of his fourth cabinet. He remained as caretaker prime minister until after the government formation following the November 2023 general election and the appointment of the Schoof cabinet.

=== New Zealand ===

In 1984, a constitutional crisis arose when the outgoing &quot;lame duck&quot; Prime Minister Robert Muldoon refused to follow the wishes of a new incoming government led by David Lange. This was the only time in New Zealand where a &quot;lame duck&quot; Prime Minister did not follow the wishes of the incoming government.

=== United Kingdom ===
Unlike countries such as the United States that instrinsically build in a transition period between elections and the taking of office of the elected executive, and even unlike some parliamentary systems, there is an incredibly short transition period (on the order of shorter than a day) between when the identity of the prime minister-designate is known, and their taking of office.

Following general elections where a party wins a clear majority in the House of Commons, the identity of the new prime minister is immediately apparent and they are usually appointed the following morning, minutes after their predecessor resigns the office, at back-to-back meetings with the monarch. In the case of a hung parliament where the election is followed by negotiations to form a coalition, or an attempt by the leader of the largest party to lead a minority government, a new prime minister may not be appointed for a few days. In the 2010 election for example, which was held on May 6, Gordon Brown&#x27;s Labour Party lost its majority in the Commons, but Brown remained caretaker prime minister until May 11, resigning when it became clear that the Conservative Party (which held a plurality) had reached a coalition agreement with the Liberal Democrats, whereupon the Conservative leader David Cameron was appointed prime minister.

Members of parliament cease to be such when parliament is dissolved for a general election, and cannot describe themselves as &quot;John Smith MP&quot; during the election campaign. Government ministers however, as part of the executive, continue to hold office unless and until new ministers are appointed after the election.

An example of an extended transition period in the informal sense was the last two years of the premiership of Tony Blair, who before the 2005 United Kingdom general election, announced he would not stand for another election if Labour were to win the 2005 election. The fact that Blair&#x27;s Labour Party was returned with a substantially reduced majority and that Gordon Brown (who was correctly believed to be Blair&#x27;s successor) had played a leading part in the election campaign, aroused considerable speculation about Blair&#x27;s future as party leader and prime minister.

=== United States ===
In U.S. politics, the period between (presidential and congressional) elections in November and the inauguration of officials early in the following year is commonly called the &quot;lame-duck period&quot;. A president is a lame duck after a successor has been elected, during which time the outgoing president and president-elect usually embark on a transition of power.

Until 1933, inaugurations occurred on March 4. Congress usually had two sessions, the second of which was usually held from the December after the election of the next Congress until March. This session was commonly called the &quot;lame-duck session&quot;. Criticism of this process led to the passage of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933, which moved the beginning of the new Congress to January 3 and the inauguration of the president to January 20, thus shortening the lame duck period.

A president elected to a second term is sometimes seen as a lame duck from early in the second term, since term limits prevent them from contesting re-election four years later. However, not personally having to face the electorate again makes a second-term president more powerful than they were in their first term as they are thus freer to take politically unpopular actions. However, this comes with caveats; as the de facto leader of their political party, the president&#x27;s actions affect how the party performs in the midterm elections two years into the second term, and, to some extent, the success of that party&#x27;s nominee in the next presidential election four years in the future. For these reasons, it can be argued that a president in their second term is not a lame duck at all.

In his farewell speech from the office of president in January 2017, Barack Obama jokingly quipped, &quot;You can tell that I&#x27;m a lame duck because nobody&#x27;s following instructions&quot; when the cheering and applause from the crowd prevented him from commencing his speech. Joe Biden, who ultimately chose not to seek re-election in favour of his vice-president Kamala Harris, was also referred to as a lame duck president after his announcement not to run for president a second time.

=== Vatican City ===
On February 11, 2013, when Pope Benedict XVI announced that he was resigning within 17 days, he was called a &quot;lame duck pope&quot; by some media outlets. Also, due to Pope John Paul II&#x27;s long and debilitating illness, some journalists (such as &quot;Time&quot;″s Jeff Israely) described the final years of his reign as a lame duck papacy.

=== Venezuela ===
The discontent with the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela saw the opposition being elected to hold the majority in the National Assembly of Venezuela for the first time since 1999 following the 2015 parliamentary election. As a result of that election, the lame-duck National Assembly consisting of United Socialist officials filled the Supreme Tribunal (supreme court) with allies. Into early 2016, the Supreme Tribunal alleged that voting irregularities occurred in the parliamentary elections and stripped four Assembly members of their seats, preventing an opposition supermajority in the National Assembly which would be able to challenge President Maduro. The Assembly nevertheless swore in the members in question, in response to which the Supreme Court ruled that the Assembly was in contempt of court and in violation of the constitutional order. The Supreme Tribunal then began to approve multiple actions performed by Maduro and granted him more powers and later stripped the National Assembly of legislative powers, and took those powers for itself; which meant that the Supreme Tribunal might have been able to create laws, causing the 2017 constitutional crisis.

== Other ==
=== Sports ===
In sports usage, a coach or general manager in the final year of their contract without a forthcoming contract extension is often described as a lame duck.

Additionally, if a team is on track to miss the playoffs, a coach or general manager can be regarded as a lame duck even if they are under a multiyear contract if they are expected to be fired shortly before or once the season ends. Often taking the blame as the team is out of contention for the postseason, the coach or/and general manager is seen as a poor fit or otherwise does not relate well with others players and other coaches, the media, their superiors and so forth and a change in leadership is apparently forthcoming or desired. Often, there will be rumors of a coach and/or manager departure often by dismissal or forced resignation (also known as &quot;by mutual consent&quot;) with said rumors often beginning several games before the end of the season. Dismissal of the coach and/or manager once the team is eliminated from reaching the postseason, rather than waiting for the conclusion of the season, does cut short their &quot;lame duck&quot; status and clears the way for new hires. In that case, an interim coach and/or interim manager will be appointed to see out the remainder of the season, though their predecessors may still remain on the club payroll as a &quot;special advisor&quot; until their contract expires.

=== Business ===
Especially in the United Kingdom, a &quot;lame duck company&quot; is one that is in such financial difficulty that it is not worth investing in, or is unworthy of government support.

=== Software engineering ===
In networked server systems, the term &quot;lame duck mode&quot; is used to describe a networked server in the process of shutting down (e.g., for a software update or relocating to a different physical machine). During lame duck mode, which can last from a few seconds to a few minutes, the server will finish serving existing clients and requests, and for some time will continue accepting new requests, while notifying clients not to contact them again for some time. If the server continues receiving new requests after this grace period, it might stop serving them and shut down anyway, depending on a desired outcome and configuration. Proper cooperation of client applications reduces service disruption and retry latency in distributed systems. There are many other possible variations of &quot;lame duck mode&quot;, like serving existing connections, but not accepting any new connections. As such, lame duck mode is a method of load balancing.

<doc id="339245" wikidata="Q1921090" url="?curid=339245" title="Meramec River">
<text>The Meramec River (), sometimes spelled Maramec River (the original US mapping spelled it Maramec but later changed it to Meramec), is one of the longest free-flowing waterways in the U.S. state of Missouri, draining while wandering from headwaters southeast of Salem to where it empties into the Mississippi River near St. Louis at Arnold and Oakville. The Meramec watershed covers
six Missouri Ozark Highland counties—Dent, Phelps, Crawford, Franklin, Jefferson, and St. Louis—and portions of eight others—Maries, Gasconade, Iron, Washington, Reynolds, St. Francois, Ste. Genevieve, and Texas. Between its source and its mouth, it falls . Year-round navigability begins above Maramec Spring, just south of St. James. The Meramec&#x27;s size increases at the confluence of the Dry Fork, and its navigability continues until the river enters the Mississippi at Arnold, Missouri.
==History==
The origin of the name is unclear, but some have asserted that it might mean &#x27;the river of ugly fishes&#x27; or &#x27;ugly water&#x27; in Algonquian. Early variant spellings of the name were Mearamigoua, Maramig, Mirameg, Meramecsipy, Merramec, Merrimac, Mearmeig, and Maramecquisipi. The first European explorer was French Jesuit priest Jacques Gravier, who traveled the river in 1699–1700. Early on, the river became an important industrial shipping route, with lead, iron, and timber being sent downstream by flatboat and shallow-draft steamboat.

Today, the river is used commercially by tour boats and sand and gravel mining barges. It also is used by canoe outfitters and ferry boat excursions. Numerous trails travel along the river and up over the bluffs, giving the hiker a glimpse of ducks, herons, beavers and other species of wildlife which may be seen along the river.

==Ecology==

At one time, the river was listed as one of the most polluted rivers in Missouri. Local and state government along the river have taken steps in cleaning it up. Today the river is one of the most diverse waters in Missouri. The river is plentiful in black crappie, channel catfish, flathead catfish, largemouth bass, paddlefish, rainbow trout, brown trout, rock bass, smallmouth bass, walleye, white crappie, and some of the richest mussel beds in the state. The endangered Eastern Hellbender &quot;(Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis)&quot; also lives in the river.

The Meramec River includes one of only three Red Ribbon Trout Areas in the state of Missouri, hosting healthy rainbow trout and brown trout populations where large springs flowing into the river provide the cool water required by these species. Red Ribbon trout streams are managed by the Missouri Department of Conservation to produce trophy-sized fish.

Maramec Spring is the fifth-largest spring in Missouri. Maramec Spring Park, south of St. James, is the home of an historic iron works and trout fishery.

==Flooding==
As a free-flowing river with no flood control dams, the Meramec is subject to flooding. In addition to a flood in December 1982, there was major flooding December 2015 and in May 2017. Only the community of Valley Park, protected by a $50 million levee designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was spared. For the first time in state history, MoDOT had to shut down I-55 from flooding in 2015.

Flood risk along the Meramec is increasing, with the communities of cities like Eureka, Pacific and Valley Park bracing for “100-year” floods twice during a 16-month period between 2015 and 2017. A St. Louis Post Dispatch headline stated that &quot;Two catastrophic floods in less than two years wasn&#x27;t just a case of bad luck,&quot; and attributed the flooding to &quot;worrisome climate trends&quot; and &quot;failed flood policy that both constricts and swells waterways through levee construction and flood plain development.&quot;

===Meramec Basin Project===
The free-flowing Meramec River and several of its tributaries narrowly avoided being impounded by several dams proposed by the Corps of Engineers. The United States Congress authorized several large dams in the upper Mississippi and Meramec river basins in 1938 following severe flooding in 1927 and 1937. World War II intervened, and plans were delayed and altered, but the Meramec Basin Project finally started moving forward in the 1960s. The main dam was to be at Sullivan, Missouri, at Meramec State Park, with several additional dams upstream. These plans ran into opposition from the growing environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s, as well as from recreational users of the free-flowing Meramec. The failure of the Teton Dam in 1976 increased the public&#x27;s doubt about the wisdom of the project.

Grass-roots opposition forced politicians originally in favor of the project to reconsider. At the request of Senators Jack Danforth and Tom Eagleton, Missouri Governor Kit Bond allowed a non-binding referendum to be put on ballots in twelve surrounding counties. On August 8, 1978, 64 percent of the voters rejected the dam proposal. The referendum carried no legal weight but caused Congress to reconsider. Under President Jimmy Carter, funding was removed from the project. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan signed the bill de-authorizing the project. This was one of the first times that a Corps of Engineers project was stopped once construction had begun, and it marked a major victory for the American environmental movement.

<text>The Presidential Range is a mountain range located in the White Mountains of the U.S. state of New Hampshire. Containing the highest peaks of the Whites, its most notable summits are named for American presidents, followed by prominent public figures of the 18th and 19th centuries. The Presidential Range is notorious for having some of the worst weather on Earth, mainly because of the unpredictability of high wind speeds and whiteout conditions on the higher summits. Because of the poor weather conditions, the Presidential Range is often used for mountaineering training for those who go on to climb some of the world&#x27;s highest mountains, including K2 and Everest.

Mount Washington, long home of the highest winds recorded on the surface of the Earth at , is the tallest at , followed by neighboring peaks Mount Adams at and Mount Jefferson at . The range is almost entirely in Coos County.

==Notable summits==
The highest mountains in the Presidential Range are named principally for U.S. presidents, with the tallest mountain (Mount Washington) named for the first president and the second tallest (Mount Adams) for the second president.

Among the range&#x27;s most notable summits (in sequence from southwest to northeast):
* Mount Webster — after Daniel Webster
* Mount Jackson* — after Charles Thomas Jackson (19th-century geologist)
* Mount Pierce* — after Franklin Pierce (formerly Mt. Clinton — after DeWitt Clinton)
* Mount Eisenhower* — after Dwight D. Eisenhower
* Mount Franklin — after Benjamin Franklin
* Mount Monroe* — after James Monroe
* Mount Washington* — after George Washington (a general at time of naming in 1784, and only later a president)
* Mount Clay — after Henry Clay (State of New Hampshire changed name to Mount Reagan after Ronald Reagan; U.S. government still recognizes Clay name)
* Mount Jefferson* — after Thomas Jefferson
* Mount Sam Adams — after Samuel Adams
* Mount Adams* — after John Adams
* Mount Quincy Adams — after John Quincy Adams
* Mount Madison* — after James Madison

Mount Adams has four subsidiary peaks besides its summit that are also commonly recognized by name. Two are listed above (Sam Adams and John Quincy Adams). The third and fourth are:
*Mount Abigail Adams (formerly Adams IV)
*Adams V

The summits marked with an asterisk (*) are included on the peak bagging list of 4,000-foot and higher mountains in New Hampshire; the others are excluded, in some cases because of lesser height and in others because of more technical criteria.
== Other summits ==

Aside from the notable summits, the Presidential Range contains a number of additional named peaks. Several of these peaks, drained on their west faces by the Dry River, are less accessible than the main and most-visited ridge of the range.

Subsidiary peaks of Mount Washington:
* Ball Crag (6,106 ft)
* Nelson Crag (5,620 ft)
* Boott Spur (5,500 ft)

North from Mount Washington:
* Mount Bowman (3,449 ft) (spur of Mount Jefferson)

South from Mount Washington:
* Engine Hill (3,100 ft)
* Maple Mountain (2,601 ft)
* Iron Mountain (2,726 ft)
* Montalban Ridge:
** Mount Isolation (4,004 ft)*
** Mount Davis (3,819 ft)
** Stairs Mountain (3,463 ft)
** Mount Resolution (3,415 ft)
* Bemis Ridge:
** Mount Crawford (3,119 ft)
** Mount Hope (2,505 ft)
* Mount Parker (3,004 ft)
* Mount Langdon (2,390 ft)
* Mount Pickering (1,945 ft) (family name of first president of Appalachian Mountain Club)
* Mount Stanton (1,716 ft)

The summits marked with an asterisk (*) are included on the peak-bagging list of 4,000-foot and higher mountains in New Hampshire; the others are excluded, in some cases because of lesser height and in others because of more technical criteria.

==Watersheds==
The Presidentials separate drainage via the Saco and Androscoggin rivers into the Atlantic Ocean on the coast of Maine, from drainage into the Israel and Ammonoosuc rivers, thence into the Connecticut River, and thence into Long Island Sound.

==Presidential Traverse==
The so-called Presidential Traverse is a hike that traverses each major summit along the of the Presidential ridge. The traverse encompasses over in elevation gain. It can be done in a single day in summer, but during winter it is generally a two- to four-day venture. The traverse is considered strenuous.

==Hazards==

The range is notorious for its unpredictable and inclement weather, with some of the deadliest mountains in the continental United States. Due to its unique location relative to other geographic features, it holds the world record for highest recorded surface wind speed not within a tropical cyclone. Fatalities in this area are dominated by those that occur on Mount Washington, the highest peak in the range. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department conducts an average of 200 rescues a year for hikers in need of assistance.

<text>The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) is a gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes, gallinaceous birds. It is sometimes known as French partridge, to distinguish it from the English or grey partridge. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;alektoris&quot; a farmyard chicken, and &quot;rufa&quot; is Latin for red or rufous.

It is a rotund bird, with a light brown back, grey breast and buff belly. The face is white with a black gorget. It has rufous-streaked flanks and red legs. When disturbed, it prefers to run rather than fly, but if necessary it flies a short distance on rounded wings. This is a seed-eating species, but the young in particular take insects as an essential protein supply. The call is a three-syllable &quot;ka-chu-chu&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The red-legged partridge was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tetrao rufus&quot;. Linnaeus designated the type locality as southern Europe but this is now restricted to northern Italy. The specific epithet is Latin meaning &quot;red&quot; or &quot;rufous&quot;. The red-legged partridge is now one of seven partridge species placed in the genus &quot;Alectoris &quot; that was introduced in 1829 by German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. r. rufa&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Britain, France, north Italy and Corsica
* &quot;A. r. hispanica&quot; (Seoane, 1894) – north, west Iberian Peninsula
* &quot;A. r. intercedens&quot; (Brehm, AE, 1857) – east, south Iberian Peninsula

==Description==

Adult red-legged partridges are sandy-brown above, pinkish-buff on the belly, and pale grey on the breast, with a prominent gorget of black streaking, bold rufous and black flank-bars, a cream throat, pink legs, and a red bill and eye ring.

The crown and upper nape of adult red-legged partridge are a warm pinkish-brown; the fore crown and lateral edges of the crown are pale blue-grey, and the bird has a narrow off-white supercilium running from above the lores to the sides of the lower nape. The lores have a solid bar of black feathering above a patch of pinkish-red skin. This black colouration continues behind the eye, where it broadens, and then extends down around the throat-patch to meet the upper edge of the gorget. There is a patch of pale buff-brown feathering on the ear-coverts, adjoining the black. The eye is surrounded by a bright red eye-ring.

The chin and upper throat are creamy-white, and are bordered behind and below by a solid black gorget. The black colour continues down onto the lower throat as a patch of broad triangular black streaks on a pale sandy-grey background. Similar, but narrower, black streaks are present on a pale blue-grey background on the upper neck-sides, while the lower neck-sides are warm pinkish-brown. The breast is pale blue-grey, and the belly pinkish-buff. The flanks are marked with bold bright rufous-brown bars, typically between eight and ten; each bar has a narrow black leading edge, the background colour is off-white in front of each bar, and pale grey behind. The upper parts are plain, unmarked dark sandy-grey. The uppertail-coverts are similar in colour, and contrast with the pinkish-rufous tail-feathers.

The bill is bright red, the iris is medium brown, and the legs are pinkish-red.

==Distribution and habitat==
This partridge breeds naturally in southwestern Europe (France, Iberia and northwest Italy). It has become naturalised in flat areas of England and Wales, where it was introduced as a game species, and has been seen breeding as far north as Sutherland. It is replaced in southeastern Europe by the very similar rock partridge (&quot;Alectoris graeca&quot;). It is a non-migratory terrestrial species, which forms flocks outside the breeding season.

This species breeds on dry lowlands, such as farmland and open stony areas, laying its eggs in a ground nest. They have been known to cohabit with wild rabbits.

==Cultivation and consumption==

Red-legged partridge are bred for shooting, and sold and eaten as game.

==Great Britain==
The natural range of the red-legged partridge is France, Spain and Portugal. However, it was introduced from France to Great Britain in the 18th century, and has since become an important gamebird there. As it is a mediterranean species, it thrives in hot, dry areas with sandy soil. The ability to breed two clutches simultaneously has led to it being extensively reared in captivity, and released for shooting. The breeding of chukars (&quot;Alectoris chukar&quot;) and red-legged/chukar hybrids is prohibited, due to its impact on wild populations of red-legs. The red-legged partridge is believed to be in decline across its range.

==New Zealand==
Many red-legged partridges are kept and bred in captivity in New Zealand aviaries where the population is considered secure at the moment. These particular birds are all descendants from one of the last attempts at introducing the species to the wild by the (Auckland) Acclimatisation Society.

A consignment of 1500 eggs was sent from the United Kingdom in July 1980. However, the boxes were delayed by two days and had evidently over-heated en route. There was further delay in getting the eggs through customs and quarantine clearance. By the time they reached Massey University (which had been invested in to take on the project), hopes were not high and only 135 chicks were hatched. Two further consignments totaling 638 eggs were sent mid-1981. From these only 53 chicks hatched. The plan was to rear these birds and put them through six breeding cycles in two years using controlled lighting and thus establish a substantial breeding nucleus. The programme at Massey was soon terminated and all the birds dispersed to other breeders, primarily the game farm at Te Ahoha which had already produced some young, but some were also given to the Wildlife Service. At the end of the 1983 breeding season, the population had increased to 940 birds.

The current actual status of wild, self-sustaining red-legged partridges in New Zealand is questionable. Back-yard agriculturalists and gamebird breeders/preserves hold most of the population. Some zoos and farm-parks exhibit this species. It is not frequently eaten by the public.

Similar species is the chukar partridge which is not allowed to be kept in captivity and has been naturalized in the South Island as an upland game bird since the 1930s. The chukar partridge&#x27;s population has been in decline since the late 1980s. Other introduced gamebirds are bobwhite quail, brown quail, California quail, guinea fowl, blue peafowl, wild turkey, and pheasant. Major management efforts are made for the more valued of these species, such as bobwhites and pheasants.

<text>Crashing the Party is a 2002 book by Ralph Nader detailing his experiences running in the 2000 U.S. presidential election.

==Summary==
Much of the book focuses on critiquing the modern Democratic Party, with Nader arguing that the party has become too much beholden to donors and drifted from the tradition of Franklin Delano Roosevelt; at one point, he remarks that &quot;the Democrats might as well be Republicans&quot; for their similar positions on many economic issues. Nader also criticizes the national media, accusing them of corruption and noting that &quot;I can&#x27;t overemphasize the influence of The New York Times and Washington Post in setting the scene for the rest of the media&quot;. The book concludes with a list of ten &quot;First Stage Goals for a Better America.&quot;

==Publication==
The book was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press in January 2002. The subtitle &quot;How to Tell the Truth and Still Run for President&quot; was considered significant because, according to critic Jonathan Chait, an &quot;aura&quot; honesty and trustworthiness had been central to Nader&#x27;s work, both as an attorney and as a political candidate. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; predicted that the book would find its most success in the areas where Nader had won the most votes in the election.

<text>Petit Jean State Park is a park in Conway County, Arkansas managed by the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism. It is located on top of Petit Jean Mountain next to the Arkansas River in the area between the Ouachita Mountains and the Ozark Plateaus.

==Legend and naming==
According to legend Petit Jean was actually a young 18th century French woman. When she discovered that her fiancé planned to explore the Louisiana Territory, she cut her hair, disguised herself as a boy and managed to find a position as a cabin boy. She survived the voyage and the expedition began their exploration. Once they had reached the area of the mountain, the young woman became ill, on her deathbed she revealed herself to her fiancé, and was buried on the mountain, not under her own name, but under the name she had been known by on the ship, &quot;Little John&quot;.

Locals pronounce the name &quot;PET-ih jeen&quot; or &quot;petty jeen&quot;.

==The park==
Buildings of log and stone construction built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s are scattered throughout the park giving it a rustic feel. A 24-room historic lodge called Mather Lodge sits on the edge of a bluff of a deep forested canyon. In addition to the lodge there are 32 cabins and 127 campsites available for park visitors.

The canyon and bluffs were created by Cedar Creek, which cascades into the canyon in an impressive waterfall. Above the falls, Cedar Creek has been dammed to create the Lake Bailey which is used for pedal-boating and fishing.

Petit Jean has a visitor center and gift shop in the center of the park and a boathouse at Lake Bailey that provides boat rentals, fishing supplies, and a snack bar. Tennis and basketball courts, a swimming pool, and picnic areas are available for the use of park guests.

The Museum of Automobiles is less than a mile from the main camping areas.

The park also has several geological and archaeological features such as Bear Cave, Rock House Cave, the Grotto, Turtle Rocks, Carpet Rocks, and Natural Bridge. The scenic overlook at Petit Jean&#x27;s grave provides a view of the Arkansas River Valley.

In 2017, Petit Jean was rated as the best campsite in Arkansas in a 50-state survey conducted by Msn.com.

==Buildings and infrastructure==

A significant portion of the park&#x27;s infrastructure was developed in the 1930s by work crews of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and many of those elements remain in good condition, forming an important element of the park&#x27;s appearance. The CCC crews built roads, buildings, trails, and the dams which impound Lake Bailey and Roosevelt Lake. These features are described in further detail below. Many of them have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Buildings===
The CCC built a number of significant buildings in the park, including administrative and public-use facilities. The most prominent of these is probably Mather Lodge, a large Rustic stone building built in 1935, enlarged in 1940 (also by the CCC), and again about 1960, when its restaurant wing was added. The main administration building, now partly converted to a gift shop, was also built about 1935. One of the more unusual buildings the CCC erected in the park is its original water treatment building (now abandoned), a roughly square stone structure, which, despite its remote location away from the tourist facilities, is still in the Rustic style of its public buildings. It was in the park&#x27;s early years a critical element of its infrastructure, housing equipment that filtered and sanitized water for park visitors.

The park&#x27;s facilities also include a series of cabins available for rent by visitors. Four of these were built by the CCC, and exhibit its classic Rustic style. All four (cabin numbers 1, 6, 9, and 16) were built about 1935, and are roughly T-shaped stone structures, with gabled or hipped roofs and projecting central porches. Cabin #1 has a stone patio to one side. Cabin #6 has a shed-roof porch with views of the canyon. Cabin #9 is partially finished with weatherboard siding, and has an original stone masonry cooking pit nearby. Cabin #16 is rectangular, with its porch supported by log columns.

===Roads, bridges, and trails===
The CCC built several roads and trails through the park. The Blue Hole Road, which now forms part of the Boy Scout Trail, originally provided vehicular access from the Red Bluff loop road down to the Blue Hole swimming area. Surviving features include culverts, a retaining wall, and some guard rail. A well-preserved section of trail built by the CCC is the Cedar Falls Trail, which provides access from Mather Lodge into the canyon, and includes a bridge across Cedar Creek.

Two CCC-built road-related structures are still in active use for vehicular traffic. A box culvert built out of stone underlies Highway 154, the main access road through the park, and the Cedar Creek Bridge carries Red Bluff Drive over Cedar Creek, just below the outlet of Lake Roosevelt. There is also a now-disused pedestrian bridge, built of concrete to resemble logs (in a cruder version of works done by Dionicio Rodriguez elsewhere in Arkansas) in one of the park&#x27;s grassy areas.

<text>Gerard de Malynes (fl. 1585–1627) was an independent merchant in foreign trade, an English commissioner in the Spanish Netherlands, a government advisor on trade matters, assay master of the mint, and commissioner of mint affairs. His dates of birth and death are unknown.

==Life==
Malynes stated that his ancestors were from Lancashire. His father, a mint-master, may have emigrated about 1552 to Antwerp, where Gerard was born, and returned to England at the time of the restoration of the currency (1561), when Elizabeth obtained the assistance of skilled workmen from Flanders. Malynes showed how an outflow of precious metals could lead to a fall in prices for goods at home and a rise in prices abroad. This was an important clarification of the economic thought of the time. He suggested that higher import tariffs should be levied and exports of bullion prohibited, because he believed that a country&#x27;s growth was related to the accumulation of precious metals.

Malynes was appointed (about 1586) one of the commissioners of trade in the Low Countries. He was in England in 1587, when he purchased from Sir Francis Drake some of the pearls which Drake brought from Cartagena. He was frequently consulted on mercantile affairs by the privy council. In 1600 he was appointed one of the commissioners for establishing the true par of exchange, and he gave evidence before the committee of the House of Commons on the Merchants&#x27; Assurance Bill (November and December 1601). While the Act for the True Making of Woollen Cloth (4 Jac. I, c. 2) was passing through parliament he prepared for the privy council a report showing the weight, length, and breadth of all kinds of cloth.

During the reign of James I, Malynes took part in schemes for developing natural resources. Among them was an attempt to work lead mines in Yorkshire and silver mines in County Durham in 1606, when at his own charge he brought workmen from Germany. He was joined by Lord Eure and some London merchants, but the undertaking failed. Monetary questions were his major concern, and he was an assay master of the mint.

In 1609 Malynes was a commissioner on mint affairs, along with Thomas Knyvet, 1st Baron Knyvet, Sir Richard Martin, John Williams the king&#x27;s goldsmith, and others. Shortly afterwards he engaged in a scheme for supplying a deficiency in the currency, of coins of small value, by the issue of farthing tokens. Private traders had for some years infringed the royal prerogative by striking farthing tokens in lead. A proposal which seems to have been inspired by Malynes, was put forth in 1612 to remedy this. The scheme was adopted, and John Harington, 2nd Baron Harington of Exton obtained the patent for supplying the new coins (10 April 1613), which he assigned to Malynes and William Cockayne, in accordance with an agreement previously made with the former. On the withdrawal of Cockayne, who did not like the terms of the original grant, Malynes was joined by John Couchman. But from the first the contractors were unfortunate. The Duke of Lennox tried to obtain the patent from Lord Harington by offering better terms than Malynes. The new farthings, which were called &quot;Haringtons&quot;, were unpopular. They were refused in Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Flint, and Denbigh; and even in counties where they were accepted the demand for them was low, and in six months the issue was less than £600. The death of Lord Harington in 1614 gave rise to new difficulties, the patent was infringed, and private traders continued to issue illegal coins.

Malynes, in a petition which he addressed to the king from the Fleet Prison (16 February 1619) complained that he had been ruined by his employers, who insisted on paying him in his own farthings. But he appears to have surmounted these difficulties. In 1622 he gave evidence on the state of the coinage before the standing commission on trade. Malynes was impressed with the effects of usurers on the poorer classes. He proposed the adoption of a system of pawnbroking and a mount of piety, under government control. In this way he hoped to enable poor people to obtain loans at a moderate rate of interest.

In 1622 Malynes and fellow merchant Edward Misselden began a famous dispute on free trade.

Malynes addressed a petition to the House of Commons of 1641.

==Economic theory==
He was a supporter of ideas similar to mercantilism. He claimed that the scarcity of the currency was due to the speculation of the money changers. Such speculation would make the England&#x27;s currency devaluate and for that reason the english goods were sold cheap abroad and the foreign goods sold expensively in national soil; for this the balance of trade would be in deficit.

<text>Montfrin () is a commune in the Gard department in southern France.

==Population==
The residents are called &quot;Montfrinois&quot; in French.

==Geography==
Montfrin is located between Nîmes and Avignon, from Pont du Gard. The Gardon flows through the commune.

==History==
In Roman times, the place was called &quot;Mons Ferinus&quot; (&quot;mountain of the ferocious animals&quot;).

Charles Martel fought a battle there against the Saracens in 736, four years after the Battle of Tours.

The village has attracted celebrities during its history (including François I, Richelieu, Molière), and until the French Revolution, due to the presence of a &quot;healing&quot; spring, the spring of &quot;Fontcluse&quot;. A story says that the virtues of the spring were discovered by Charles Martel, who witnessed the healing of wounded soldiers after the battle.

<doc id="339300" wikidata="Q1152481" url="?curid=339300" title="The Dragons of Eden">
<text>The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence is a 1977 book by Carl Sagan, in which the author combines the fields of anthropology, evolutionary biology, psychology, and computer science to give a perspective on how human intelligence may have evolved.

Sagan discusses the search for a quantitative means of measuring intelligence. He argues that the brain to body mass ratio is an extremely good correlative indicator for intelligence, with humans having the highest ratio and dolphins the second highest, though he views the trend as breaking down at smaller scales, with some small animals (ants in particular) placing disproportionately high on the list. Other topics mentioned include the evolution of the brain (with emphasis on the function of the neocortex in humans), the evolutionary purpose of sleep and dreams, demonstration of sign language abilities by chimps and the purpose of mankind&#x27;s innate fears and myths. The title &quot;The Dragons of Eden&quot; is borrowed from the notion that man&#x27;s early struggle for survival in the face of predators, and in particular a fear of reptiles, may have led to cultural beliefs and myths about dragons.

&quot;The Dragons of Eden&quot; won a Pulitzer Prize. In 2002, John Skoyles and Dorion Sagan published a follow-up entitled &quot;Up from Dragons&quot;.

==Summary==
The book is an expansion of the Jacob Bronowski Memorial Lecture in Natural Philosophy which Sagan gave at the University of Toronto. In the introduction Sagan presents his thesis – that &quot;the mind ... [is] a consequence of its anatomy and physiology and nothing more&quot; – in reference to the works of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace.

In chapter 2, Sagan briefly summarizes the entire evolution of species starting from the Big Bang to the beginning of the human civilization with the help of a &quot;Cosmic Calendar&quot;, an analogy where one year in the calendar corresponds to the time since the Big Bang. Sagan used the same analogy in the more-widely known television series &quot;&quot;.

It is disconcerting to find that in such a cosmic year the Earth does not condense out of interstellar matter until early September, dinosaurs emerge on Christmas Eve; flowers arise on December 28; and men and women originate at 10:30  on New Year&#x27;s Eve. All of recorded history occupies the last 10 seconds of December 31; and the time from the waning of the Middle Ages to the present occupies little more than one second.

==Reception==
Writing for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, John Leonard called the book &quot;a delight&quot; and described Sagan as &quot;a scientific Robert Redford, handsome and articulate and all business.&quot; The book was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1978.

==In popular culture==

In 2008, an album called &quot;The Dragons of Eden&quot; was released by keyboard player and producer Travis Dickerson along with guitar virtuoso Buckethead and drummer Bryan &quot;Brain&quot; Mantia. The album derives its track titles from the book&#x27;s chapters.

<text>Campaign financealso called election finance, political donations, or political financerefers to the funds raised to promote candidates, political parties, or policy initiatives and referendums. Donors and recipients include individuals, corporations, political parties, and charitable organizations.

Political campaigns usually involve considerable costs, travel, staff, political consulting, and advertising. Campaign spending depends on the region. For instance, in the United States, television advertising time must be purchased by campaigns, whereas in other countries, it is provided for free. The need to raise money to maintain expensive political campaigns diminishes ties to a representative democracy because of the influence large contributors have over politicians.

Although the political science literature indicates that most contributors give to support parties or candidates with whom they are already in agreement, there is wide public perception that donors expect government favors in return (such as specific legislation being enacted or defeated), so some have come to equate campaign finance with political corruption and bribery. These views have led governments to reform campaign financing in the hope of eliminating big money influence.

The causes and effects of campaign finance rules are studied in political science, economics, and public policy, among other disciplines.

==Private financing==

Some countries rely heavily on private donors to finance political campaigns. These kinds of donations can come from private individuals, as well as groups such as trade unions and for-profit corporations. Tactics for raising money may include direct mail solicitation, attempts to encourage supporters to contribute via the Internet, direct solicitation from the candidate, and events specifically for the purpose of fundraising, or other activities.

Fundraising from private donors is often a significant activity for the campaign staff and the candidate, especially in larger and more prominent campaigns. For example, one survey in the United States found that 23% of candidates for statewide office surveyed say that they spent more than half of their scheduled time raising money. Over half of all candidates surveyed spent at least 1/4 of their time on fundraising.

Supporters of private financing systems believe that, in addition to avoiding government limitations on speech, private financing fosters civic involvement, ensures that a diversity of views are heard, and prevents government from tilting the scales to favor those in power or with political influence. Critics of private campaign financing claim that it leads to votes being &quot;bought&quot; and producing large gaps between different parties in the money they have to campaign against. One study finds that political donations gives donors significantly greater access to policymakers. Most countries that rely on private donations to fund campaigns require extensive disclosure of contributions, frequently including information such as the name, employer and address of donors. This is intended to allow for policing of undue donor influence by other campaigns or by good government groups, while preserving most benefits of private financing, including the right to make donations and to spend money for political speech, saving government the expense of funding campaigns, and keeping government from funding partisan speech that some citizens may find odious. However, in countries such as the United States, &quot;dark money&quot; spent on political campaigns is exempt from disclosure, and dark money spending has mushroomed in recent years in US state and federal elections, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in each U.S. presidential election.

==Public financing==

Other countries choose to use government funding to run campaigns. Funding campaigns from the government budget is widespread in South America and Europe. The mechanisms for this can be quite varied, ranging from direct subsidy of political parties to government matching funds for certain types of private donations (often small donations) to exemption from fees of government services (e.g., postage) and many other systems as well. Supporters of government financing generally believe that the system decreases corruption; in addition, many proponents believe that government financing promotes other values, such as civic participation or greater faith in the political process. Not all government subsidies take the form of money; some systems require campaign materials (often air time on television) to be provided at very low rates to the candidates. Opponents sometimes criticize the expense of the government financing systems, arguing that government should not subsidize political speech.

In many countries, such as Germany and the United States, campaigns can be funded by a combination of private and public money. In the United States, public financing systems include democracy vouchers, matching funds, and lump sum grants, among other system types. Governments, international organizations and scholars are concerned about the funding of campaigns from foreign sources.

In some electoral systems, candidates who win an election or secure a minimum number of ballots are allowed to apply for a rebate to the government. The candidate submits an audited report of the campaign expenses and the government issues a rebate to the candidate, subject to some caps such as the number of votes cast for the candidate or a blanket cap. For example, in the 2008 election, candidates for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong were entitled to a rebate up to HK$11 per vote.

==Regulation==
The concept of political finance can affect various parts of a society&#x27;s institutions which support governmental and social success. Correct handling of political finance impacts a country&#x27;s ability to effectively maintain free and fair elections, effective governance, democratic government and regulation of corruption. The United Nations convention against Corruption, recognizing this, encouraged its members to &quot;enhance transparency in the funding of candidatures for elected public office and, when applicable, the funding of political parties.&quot; In a study on Global Political Finance Regulation by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), researchers Magnus Öhman, Hani Zainulbhai, Jack Santucci, and Marcin Welecki identified several common understandings on what international society has determined integral to the regulation of political finance:

Their study also affirmed the perspective laid down by the Council of Europe, when discussing the concept of effective regulation of campaign financing: &quot;[We are] convinced that raising public awareness on the issues of prevention and fight against corruption in the field of funding of political parties is essential to the good functioning of democratic institutions.&quot;

<text>Gilbert Stuart ( Stewart; December 3, 1755 – July 9, 1828) was an American painter born in the Rhode Island Colony who is widely considered one of America&#x27;s foremost portraitists. His best-known work is an unfinished portrait of George Washington, begun in 1796, which is usually referred to as the &quot;Athenaeum Portrait&quot;. Stuart retained the original and used it to paint scores of copies that were commissioned by patrons in America and abroad. The image of George Washington featured in the painting has appeared on the United States one-dollar bill for more than a century and on various postage stamps of the 19th century and early 20th century.

Stuart produced portraits of about 1,000 people, including the first six Presidents. His work can be found today at art museums throughout the United States and the United Kingdom, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Frick Collection in New York City, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Philadelphia Museum of Art in Philadelphia, the National Portrait Gallery in London, Worcester Art Museum in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Stuart was born on December 3, 1755, in Saunderstown, a village of North Kingstown in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and he was baptized at Old Narragansett Church on April 11, 1756. He was the third child of Gilbert Stuart, a Scottish immigrant employed in the snuff-making industry, and Elizabeth Anthony Stuart, a member of a prominent land-owning family from Middletown, Rhode Island. Stuart&#x27;s father owned the first snuff mill in America, which was located in the basement of the family homestead.

Stuart moved to Newport, Rhode Island, at the age of six, where his father pursued work in the merchant field. In Newport, he first began to show great promise as a painter. In 1770, he made the acquaintance of Scottish artist Cosmo Alexander, a visitor to the colonies who made portraits of local patrons and who became a tutor to Stuart. Under the guidance of Alexander, Stuart painted the portrait &quot;Dr. Hunter&#x27;s Spaniels&quot; when he was 14; it hangs today in the Hunter House Mansion in Newport.

In 1771, Stuart moved to Scotland with Alexander to finish his studies; however, Alexander died in Edinburgh one year later. Stuart tried to maintain a living and pursue his painting career, but to no avail, so he returned to Newport in 1773.

===England and Ireland===
Stuart&#x27;s prospects as a portraitist were jeopardized by the onset of the American Revolution and its social disruptions. Although he was a patriot, he departed for England in 1775 following the example set by John Singleton Copley. His painting style during this period began to develop beyond the relatively hard-edged and linear style that he had learned from Alexander. He was unsuccessful at first in pursuit of his vocation, but he became a protégé of Benjamin West in 1777 and studied with him for the next six years. The relationship was beneficial, with Stuart exhibiting for the first time at the Royal Academy in spring of 1777.

By 1782, Stuart had met with success, largely due to acclaim for &quot;The Skater&quot;, a portrait of Sir William Grant. It was Stuart&#x27;s first full-length portrait and, according to a rival, it belied the prevailing opinion that Stuart &quot;made a tolerable likeness of a face, but as to the figure, he could not get below the fifth button&#x27;&quot;. Stuart said that he was &quot;suddenly lifted into fame by a single picture&quot;.

The prices for his pictures were exceeded only by those of renowned English artists Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. Despite his many commissions, however, he was habitually neglectful of finances and was in danger of being sent to debtors&#x27; prison. In 1787, he fled to Dublin, Ireland where he painted and accumulated debt with equal vigor.

===New York City and Philadelphia===
Stuart ended his 18-year stay in Britain and Ireland in 1793, leaving behind numerous unfinished paintings. He returned to the United States with a particular goal of painting a portrait of George Washington and having an engraver reproduce it and provide for his family through the engraving&#x27;s sale. He settled briefly in New York City and pursued portrait commissions from influential people who could bring him to Washington&#x27;s attention. In 1794, he painted statesman John Jay, from whom he received a letter of introduction to Washington. In 1795, Stuart moved to the Germantown section of Philadelphia, where he opened a studio, and Washington posed for him later that year.

Stuart painted Washington in a series of iconic portraits, each of them leading to a demand for copies and keeping him busy and highly paid for years. The most famous and celebrated of these likenesses, the &quot;Athenaeum portrait,&quot; is portrayed on the United States one-dollar bill. Stuart painted about 50 reproductions of it. However, he avoided completing the original version. After finishing Washington&#x27;s face, he kept it to make copies which he sold for $100 each. Thus the original portrait remained in its unfinished state at the time of his death in 1828. An engraver at the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing, George Frederick Cumming Smillie, made an etching of the painting which was used on multiple banknotes. A vignette of the portrait appears on the 2 silver dollar bill of 1899, and the one dollar note of (1918 to 2023). United States one-dollar bills featured the image for decades (1918 to 2023).

The painting was jointly purchased by the National Portrait Gallery and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1980, and is generally on display in the National Portrait Gallery.

Another celebrated image of Washington is the full-length &quot;Lansdowne portrait&quot;, now in the National Portrait Gallery. Its historical importance is almost matched by an early forgery based on it which was purchased for the White House. This painting was rescued during the Burning of Washington in the War of 1812 thanks to the efforts of First Lady Dolley Madison and Paul Jennings, one of President James Madison&#x27;s slaves. Three replicas of the original portrait are accepted as by Stuart. Additional copies were painted by other artists. In 1803, Stuart opened a studio in Washington, D. C.

===Boston, 1805–1828===

Stuart moved to Devonshire Street in Boston in 1805, continuing in both critical acclaim and financial troubles. He exhibited works locally at Doggett&#x27;s Repository and Julien Hall. Predictably, he was sought out for advice by other Amertican artists, such as John Trumbull, Thomas Sully, Washington Allston, and John Vanderlyn.

===Personal life===
Stuart married Charlotte Coates around September 1786; she was 13 years his junior and &quot;exceedingly pretty&quot;. They had 12 children, five of whom died by 1815 and two others of whom died in their youth. Their daughter Jane (1812–1888) was also a painter. She sold many of his paintings and her replicas of them from her studios in Boston and Newport, Rhode Island. In 2011, she was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame.

In 1824, Stuart suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed, but he continued to paint for two years until his death in Boston on July 9, 1828, at 72. He was buried in the Central Burial Ground at Boston Common.

Stuart left his family deeply in debt, and his wife and daughters were unable to purchase a grave site. He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter. His family recovered from their financial troubles 10 years later, and they planned to move his body to a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could not remember the exact location of his body, and it was never moved. There is a monument for Stuart, his wife, and their children at the Common Burying Ground in Newport.

The Boston Athenæum held a benefit exhibition of Stuart&#x27;s works in August 1828 in an effort to provide financial aid for his family. More than 250 portraits were lent for this critically acclaimed and well-subscribed exhibition. This also marked the first public showing of his unfinished 1796 &quot;Athenæum&quot; portrait of Washington.

==Legacy==

By the end of his career, Gilbert Stuart had painted the likenesses of more than 1,000 American political and social figures. He was praised for the vitality and naturalness of his portraits, and his subjects found his company agreeable. John Adams said:

Stuart was known for working without the aid of sketches, beginning directly upon the canvas. His approach is suggested by the advice which he gave to his pupil Matthew Harris Jouett: &quot;Never be sparing of colour, load your pictures, but keep your colours as separate as you can. No blending, tis destruction to clear &amp; bea[u]tiful effect.&quot; Although this is an exaggeration to avoid muddiness, Stuart&#x27;s colors were remarkably fresh. At Stuart&#x27;s best, he had an extraordinary ability to convey the impression of &quot;luminous, transparent flesh&quot; with color coming from beneath. The face seemed to be embued with life, while the beauty of its coloring conveyed a spiritual quality to contemporaries. Although uneven, he could produce astonishingly strong likenesses.

John Henri Isaac Browere created a life mask of Stuart around 1825. In 1940, the U.S. Post Office issued a series of postage stamps called the &quot;Famous Americans Series&quot; commemorating famous artists, authors, inventors, scientists, poets, educators, and musicians. Gilbert Stuart is found on the 1 cent issue in the artists category, along with James McNeill Whistler, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Daniel Chester French, and Frederic Remington.

Today, Stuart&#x27;s birthplace in Saunderstown, Rhode Island, is open to the public as the Gilbert Stuart Birthplace and Museum. The birthplace consists of the original house where he was born, with copies of his paintings hanging throughout the house, as well as a separate art gallery in which are displayed several original paintings by both Gilbert Stuart and his daughter Jane. The museum opened in 1931.
Gilbert Stuart&#x27;s paintings of Washington, Jefferson, and others have served as models for dozens of U.S. postage stamps. Washington&#x27;s image from the famous portrait &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; is probably the most noted example of Stuart&#x27;s work on postage.

<doc id="339308" wikidata="Q7980" url="?curid=339308" title="Chinese Grand Prix">
<text>The Chinese Grand Prix () is a round of the Formula One World Championship. The event was held every year from 2004 until 2019 and is contracted to be held until 2030. The event was suspended from 2020 to 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in China. 

It is currently held at the Shanghai International Circuit, Jiading, Shanghai. Designed by Hermann Tilke and opened in 2004, the US$240 million Shanghai course was the most expensive Formula One circuit facility until the $6 billion Abu Dhabi course opened five years later. The track features one of the trickiest corner combinations on the Formula One calendar: Turn 1 and 2, a demanding 270-degree, right-handed corner combination whose radius decreases as the corner progresses.

== History ==
In the early 1990s, the Chinese government began to seek to host an F1 race. After Zhuhai International Circuit was opened in 1996 in the city of Zhuhai in Guangdong Province, southern China, a race there was provisionally added to the 1999 F1 World Championship calendar. But the track failed to meet FIA standard and the race was cancelled. 

In 2002, it was announced that the management of the Shanghai International Circuit, with assistance from the organizers of the Macau Grand Prix, had signed a seven-year contract with Formula One Management to host the Chinese Grand Prix from 2004 until 2011. The first Chinese Grand Prix, held on 26 September 2004, was won by Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello. The following year, it hosted the final round of the Formula One championship, in which the newly crowned world champion Fernando Alonso won and claimed the constructor&#x27;s title for Renault. In 2006, the Chinese Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, his last victory in Formula One.

In November 2008, the BBC reported that a senior race official, Qiu Weichang, had suggested that the money-losing race might be cancelled. Following a similar announcement about the French Grand Prix, Qiu said that the race&#x27;s future was under consideration, and a decision would be made in 2009.

2010 came and went with no formal announcement of an extension to the initial seven-race deal struck in 2004. However, immediately after the 2010 Shanghai race Bernie Ecclestone, who manages the contracts with the various circuits, said of the 2011 calendar, &quot;We are not dropping anything. [It&#x27;s] 20 races – getting ready for 25&quot;.

It was only in February 2011 that a deal was agreed between F1 and the organisers of the Chinese round of the world championship. Reasons for the delay appear to have been over the fee paid to F1 to host the race. After racking up losses year after year, the organisers of the race refused to pay the fee required, reported to be amongst the highest paid to host an F1 race. F1 bosses appear to have reduced the fee and the new agreement to host an F1 race ran to 2017.

In September 2017, a new three-year contract to host the race was announced, keeping the race on the calendar until 2020. In 2019 it hosted the 1000th round of the Formula One World Championship.

The 2020 Grand Prix, scheduled for 19 April, was postponed and later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Plans for , and races were announced and later cancelled. The Grand Prix returned to the Formula One calendar in 2024.

All Chinese Grands Prix have been held at Shanghai International Circuit.
== Support races ==
In 2004, Formula BMW Asia, Porsche Carrera Cup Asia and Asian Formula Renault Challenge supported the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix. The latter was not retained in 2005. In 2008, GP2 Asia Series became a support event while Formula BMW Asia was renamed Formula BMW Pacific. 2009 saw Porsche Carrera Cup Asia as the only support event. It remained this way until TCR International Series became a support event in 2015, although this lasted only one year. In 2019, the China Formula Grand Prix and Shell Helix FIA F4 Chinese Championship became support events.

<doc id="339330" wikidata="Q1545267" url="?curid=339330" title="Gregorio Fuentes">
<text>G.L Fuentes (July 11, 1897 – January 13, 2002) was a fisherman and the first mate of the &quot;Pilar&quot;, the boat belonging to the American writer Ernest Hemingway.

Fuentes was born in Arrecife on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. He first went to sea as deck boy with his father at age 10. As a teenager, he worked on cargo ships out of the Canary Islands to Trinidad and Puerto Rico, and from the Spanish ports of Valencia and Sevilla to South America. He migrated permanently to Cuba when he was 22. He attempted to reclaim his Spanish citizenship in 2001.

In 1938, Fuentes replaced the &quot;Pilar&quot;&#x27;s original first mate, Carlos Gutiérrez, after Hemingway&#x27;s mistress, Jane Mason, hired him to be the first mate of her boat after becoming jealous of Hemingway&#x27;s relationship with Martha Gellhorn.

Fuentes, a lifelong cigar smoker, died from cancer in Cojimar in 2002. He was often said to be the model for the character Santiago in Hemingway’s &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, but he died without having read the book. He was 104 years old.

==&quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;==

Fuentes is credited by some as a model for Hemingway&#x27;s protagonist Santiago in &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, though this is most likely the result of Fuentes&#x27; longevity and how he purposefully grew into the incarnation of the role of Santiago for tourists visiting Cojimar. Hemingway himself stated that Santiago was &quot;based on no one in particular&quot;.

That Fuentes worked closely with and knew Hemingway very well is undeniable. However, if anyone can claim credit for being the inspiration for Santiago, it was Hemingway&#x27;s original first mate, Carlos Gutiérrez. Gutiérrez had been fishing the Gulf Stream for 40 years and was already an old man when Hemingway first met him. Hemingway would credit the old fisherman with teaching him everything he knew about catching marlin, and credited Gutiérrez with telling him the Cuban tales he used as grist to write &quot;On The Blue Water: A Gulf Stream Letter&quot;.

Additionally, Hemingway laid out the plot outline for &quot;&quot;The Old Man And The Sea&quot;&quot; and how Gutiérrez&#x27;s assistance proved vital to the story&#x27;s creation and evolution in a letter written in February 1939 to his editor, Max Perkins:

Fuentes would spend his later years charging tourists $10 or $20 to take his picture and regale them with stories of his domestic partnership with Ernest Hemingway.

<text>Johann Karl August Radon (; 16 December 1887 – 25 May 1956) was an Austrian mathematician. His doctoral dissertation was on the calculus of variations (in 1910, at the University of Vienna).

== Life ==
Radon was born in Tetschen, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary, now Děčín, Czech Republic. He received his doctoral degree at the University of Vienna in 1910. He spent the winter semester 1910/11 at the University of Göttingen, then he was an assistant at the German Technical University in Brno, and from 1912 to 1919 at the Technical University of Vienna. In 1913/14, he passed his habilitation at the University of Vienna. Due to his near-sightedness, he was exempt from the draft during wartime.

In 1919, he was called to become Professor extraordinarius at the newly founded University of Hamburg; in 1922, he became &quot;Professor ordinarius&quot; at the University of Greifswald, and in 1925 at the University of Erlangen. Then he was &quot;Ordinarius&quot; at the University of Breslau from 1928 to 1945.

After a short stay at the University of Innsbruck he became &quot;Ordinarius&quot; at the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Vienna on 1 October 1946. In 1954/55, he was rector of the University of Vienna.

In 1939, Radon became corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and in 1947, he became a member. From 1952 to 1956, he was Secretary of the Class of Mathematics and Science of this Academy. From 1948 to 1950, he was president of the Austrian Mathematical Society.

Johann Radon married Maria Rigele, a secondary school teacher, in 1916. They had three sons who died young or very young. Their daughter Brigitte (1924–2020) obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Innsbruck and married the Austrian mathematician Erich Bukovics in 1950.

Radon, as Curt C. Christian described him in 1987 at the occasion of the unveiling of his brass bust at the University of Vienna, was a friendly, good-natured man, highly esteemed by students and colleagues alike, a noble personality. He did make the impression of a quiet scholar, but he was also sociable and willing to celebrate. He loved music, and he played music with friends at home, being an excellent violinist himself, and a good singer. His love for classical literature lasted through all his life.

In 2003, the Austrian Academy of Sciences founded an Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics and named it after Johann Radon (see the external link below).

== Achievements ==

Radon is known for a number of lasting contributions, including:
* his part in the Radon–Nikodym theorem;
* the Radon measure concept of measure as linear functional;
* the Radon transform, in integral geometry, based on integration over hyperplanes—with application to tomography for scanners (see tomographic reconstruction);
* Radon&#x27;s theorem, that &quot;d&quot; + 2 points in &quot;d&quot; dimensions may always be partitioned into two subsets with intersecting convex hulls;
* the Radon–Hurwitz numbers.
* He is possibly the first to make use of the so-called Radon–Riesz property.

<doc id="339335" wikidata="Q5456984" url="?curid=339335" title="Flags of the Philippine Revolution">
<text>During the Philippine Revolution, various flags were used by the Katipunan secret society and its various factions, and later, after the Katipunan&#x27;s dissolution, the Philippine Army and its civil government.

Other flags were the personal battle standards of different military zone commanders operating around Manila.

==Flags==
=== Katipunan ===
==== Personal flags ====
==== Other flags ====
===National flags===
== &quot;Evolution of the Philippine Flag&quot; set ==
A set of flag purportedly used by the Katipunan, dubbed as the &quot;Evolution of the Philippine&quot;, has been featured in postal stamps in the 1972 and the Philippine Centennial. The name of the set erroneously suggest that the modern Flag of the Philippines was derived or &quot;evolved&quot; from the flags used by the Katipunan and all of the flags themselves were national flags. The Manila Historical Institute and the National Historical Institute insist that the flags in the set, excluding the modern Philippine flag, are &quot;Flags of the Philippine Revolution&quot;. Historians also questioned the limited number of flags included in the set. It is pointed out that the &quot;Evolution of the Philippine Flag&quot; set only represents a small fraction of flags used by Katipunan battalions. The set also included flags which had limited documentation to support its actual historical usage.

== Modern usage ==

A flag reminiscent of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; flags of the past was used by a breakaway faction of army officers calling themselves &quot;Bagong Katipuneros&quot;, but labeled the &quot;Magdalo&quot; Group by the press. These officers mutinied against the government of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo at the behest of Gregorio Honasan and once again led by Antonio Trillanes IV (see Oakwood mutiny and Manila Peninsula mutiny).

<doc id="339341" wikidata="Q7337232" url="?curid=339341" title="River Churn">
<text>The River Churn is a tributary of the River Thames in central England. It rises at Seven Springs in Gloucestershire and flows south for approximately to meet the Thames at Cricklade in Wiltshire. Its length from its source to the confluence with the Thames is greater than that of the Thames from Thames Head, but the Churn is regarded as a tributary, rather than the main river.

== Description ==
The River Churn is the first tributary river of the River Thames. It rises in the Cotswolds at Seven Springs, south of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England and flows south across the Cotswold dip slope, passing through North Cerney and Cirencester, and joining the Thames in the parish of Cricklade in Wiltshire. Its length from source to confluence with the Thames is considerably greater than that of the Thames from Thames Head, and its flow is also more consistent than the winterbourne Thames, but the Churn is regarded as a tributary historically and therefore by most geography guides.

The length of the Churn is approximately . It is classed as a main river and thus falls under the jurisdiction of the Environment Agency as opposed to the local authority.

The main tributaries are the Elkstone Brook, which joins at Perrots Brook Farm, and the Daglingworth Stream, also known as the Dunt Stream or Duntisbourne, which joins at Barton Mill, Cirencester. Two smaller tributaries are the Hilcot Brook and the Gumstool Brook.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Churn&quot; is ancient, certainly pre-Roman and probably from a Celtic language, possibly that spoken by the Dobunni tribe, which controlled the area before the Roman conquest in the 1st century AD. The original name may have sounded similar to &quot;Korinn&quot;, but its meaning is unknown. It has also been suggested that the origin of the word is associated with the ancient British Cornovii tribe. Cognate names and name elements from the area are &quot;Cerney&quot;, &quot;Ciren&quot; and &quot;Corin&quot; as found in the settlement names of North Cerney, Cirencester, South Cerney, and Cerney Wick (all on or close to the river). Cirencester&#x27;s name, first recorded as &quot;Corinium Dobunnorum&quot;, is in original identical with the name of the river.

== History ==
Much of the catchment basin of the Churn was a key Roman settlement in the 2nd to 4th centuries AD, as Corinium Dobunnorum rose to likely status of capital of a division of Britain.

The Churn and the Thames feed the waters of a western bisection of the Cotswold Water Park, converted since the 1970s from redundant gravel beds between Cirencester and Cricklade.

In 2006, the national government was engaged in a planning study to analyse methods of mitigating future flooding associated with the Churn. However, the river is known to stop flowing completely at times; in September 2011 the river bed was completely dry at Latton.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measures the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

<text>Harmful to Minors: The Perils of Protecting Children From Sex ( [hardcover], [paperback]) is a 2002 book by Judith Levine. The foreword was written by former United States Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who resigned after suggesting that masturbation be destigmatized as a means of preventing young people from engaging in riskier forms of sexual activity.

The &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot; states: &quot;Most of the research for this book, including interviews, was conducted between 1996 and early 2000, and pertinent statistics were updated in 2001. The names of all nonprofessionals have been fictionalized, along with some identifying characteristics.&quot;

In the book, Levine discusses United States laws concerning child pornography, statutory rape, and abortion for minors using a variety of studies and interviews with teenagers and adults alike (see Acknowledgments). Levine also analyzes abstinence-only sex education, which Levine considers counter-productive and dangerous.

The book also examines the terms &quot;harmful to minors&quot; and &quot;indecency,&quot; which Levine considers to be umbrella terms for censorship, as well as the &quot;Dylan v. Heather&quot; case, and the little-known Support Program for Abusive Reactive Kids (SPARK) and Sexual Treatment Education Program and Services (STEP).

Because of its controversial nature and content, it was nearly impossible for Levine to find a publisher—one prospective publisher even called it &quot;radioactive.&quot; University of Minnesota Press eventually agreed to publish the book, despite intense criticism.

The book won the 2002 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Award for Current Interest.

In 2003, Thunder&#x27;s Mouth Press released a trade paperback edition of the book, which includes a new afterword by Levine which details the public response to the book.

<text>The prime minister of the Russian Federation, also domestically stylized as the chairman of the government of the Russian Federation and widely recognized as the prime minister, is the head of government of Russia and the second highest ranking political office in Russia. Although the post dates back to 1905, its current form was established on 12 December 1993 following the introduction of a new constitution.

Due to the central role of the president of Russia in the political system, the activities of the executive branch (including the prime minister) are significantly influenced by the head of state (for example, it is the president who appoints and dismisses the prime minister and other members of the government; the president may chair the meetings of the cabinet and give obligatory orders to the prime minister and other members of the government; the president may also revoke any act of the government). The use of the term &quot;prime minister&quot; is strictly informal and is never used in the constitution.

Mikhail Mishustin is the current prime minister. He was appointed on 16 January 2020 after Dmitry Medvedev and the rest of the government resigned the previous day.

== Historical background ==
== Imperial period ==
=== Early Russian prime ministers ===

Until 1905, the head of government was the emperor. In the absence of the emperor, the ministers one by one, starting with the oldest in the rank, each acted as head of government for four sessions.

In 1810, the chairmanship was granted to the state chancellor, Count Nikolay Rumyantsev, the former then chairman of the State Council. Since 1812, as chairman of the committee has evolved into an independent position, which until 1865 necessarily coincide with the presidency of the Council of State.

Traditionally, the chairmanship of the committee was last in the public service honorary position appointed by the dignitaries that have become too old to execution of the duties of the minister. A number of committee chairmen (especially duke Alexander Chernyshyov, count Alexey F. Orlov, count Dmitry Bludov) was characterized by contemporaries as &quot;barely alive&quot;, &quot;miserable&quot;. Count Modest Korf jokingly wrote about count Chernyshov: &quot;Look, just live!&quot; Duke Pavel Gagarin died in office at the age of 83 years.

=== 1905–1917 ===

The modern post of prime minister appeared in 1905. A decree of Emperor Nicholas II on 19 October 1905 established the Council of Ministers of the Russian Empire, bringing together the Ministers in one Cabinet (previously each Minister had reported directly to the Emperor on the affairs of his department). The Chairman of the Council of Ministers officially became a fully-fledged head of government. Nicholas appointed Graf Sergei Witte as his first &quot;prime minister&quot;.

From 1905 the prime minister received extensive powers, with the opportunity to pursue his own policies and reforms. Pyotr Stolypin (in office: 1906–1911) gained a reputation as one of the strongest prime ministers - during his premiership he made several major (though controversial) reforms.

Though the Russian Constitution of 1906 established the State Duma (a representative house of parliament), the Government was not responsible to it. Although Sergei Witte and Pyotr Stolypin (at the beginning of his Premiership) each tried to form a coalition government of the largest political organizations, they did not succeed. The State Duma nevertheless tried to gain influence over the government. Conflict between the State Duma and the government became particularly evident during the first Premiership of Ivan Goremykin in 1906.

The position of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Empire lasted 12 years; during this time seven people took this post (one twice). The position lapsed after the February Revolution of March 1917, following the abdication of Nicholas II from the throne on and the formation that same day of the Provisional Government.

== Provisional Government ==
During the Russian Provisional Government, the prime minister de facto headed the Russian state and was officially called the “Minister-Chairman of the Russian Provisional Government&quot;. This position was held by only two people, Georgy Lvov and Alexander Kerensky.

The position lasted about six months, and after the October Revolution, was replaced by Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Russian SFSR.

== Soviet period ==
During the reign of Vladimir Lenin, the Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars was the de facto leader of the RSFSR (from 1922 to 1991).

In 1946, the post of head of government was renamed Chairman of the Council of Ministers. People who held those positions are sometimes referred to as the prime ministers. They may have also been referred to as premier of ministers, or simply premier.

== Post-Soviet period ==
Currently, the formal title of the prime minister is &quot;Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation&quot;.

In modern Russia, the prime minister is appointed by the president, with the consent of the State Duma. The prime minister is responsible to the president and regularly reports to him, however, he only reports to the State Duma once a year.

After the election of Boris Yeltsin, President of Russia, the head of the government was Yeltsin himself. He headed the Russian SFSR Government (16 May 1992, the Government of the Russian Federation) for about six months. In fact, Yeltsin was the first Head of Government of Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union; however, he was not the prime minister. After Yeltsin, Yegor Gaidar became acting prime minister, but the Russian Supreme Soviet refused to approve him as prime minister. On 14 December 1992, the prime minister appointed was Viktor Chernomyrdin.

The Russian political system is similar to the modern French system. For the appointment of the prime minister the president needs a majority in the state Duma. If the party president does not have the majority and fails to form a coalition, the president may need to appoint a loyalist to the position of prime minister. For example, this occurred in 1998 when the state Duma (which had most of the opposition to the president of the party) twice refused to appoint Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Boris Yeltsin appointed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who supported the left opposition.

In the mid-1990s in Russia there was a term &quot;technical prime minister&quot;. This term refers to the prime minister, who is not an independent political figure, is only the nominal head of government, and in fact the activities of the government are headed by the president.

==Duties and competences==
In general, the prime minister serves more of an administrative role, nominating members of the Cabinet and taking the lead in fully implementing domestic and foreign policy as formulated by the president. In accordance with the federal constitutional law &quot;On the Government of the Russian Federation&quot; the prime minister exercises the following duties:

* determines the operating priorities of the government and organizes its work in accordance with the Constitution, federal constitutional laws, federal laws and presidential decrees, aside from running the day-to-day affairs of the government, in general.
* submits to the president proposals on the structure and functions of the central institutions of the executive branch (e.g. ministries and federal agencies);
* nominates the vice prime ministers, federal ministers and other officers and presents them to the president;
* submits to the president proposals on punishment and rewards of the government members;
* represents the government as an institution in foreign relations and inside the country;
* heads the sessions of the government and its Presidium where he has the decisive vote;
* signs the acts of the government;
* report annually to the State Duma about the government activities;
* distributes duties among members of the government;
* systematically informs the president about the government activities;

The prime minister is &quot;ex officio&quot; a member of:

* The Security Council of the Russian Federation;
* The Council of the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth of Independent States;
* The Supreme State Council of the Union State of Russia and Belarus;
* The Council of the Heads of Government of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization;
* The Interstate Council of the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC);

==Appointment==
Initially, the prime minister was appointed by the Emperor of Russia, without the consent of the candidate to the State Duma.

In Soviet times, the prime minister of the Russian SFSR was appointed by the Supreme Council after each election.

Currently the prime minister is appointed by the president of Russia, subject to the consent of the State Duma (before 1993 the Supreme Soviet). Unlike most other &quot;prime ministers&quot;, who are also elected members of the legislative body or parliament, the Chairman of the Government of Russia can be any Russian citizen, as long as they do not also hold citizenship of another country.

Under law, the president shall nominate a new Chairman of the Government within two weeks of the resignation of a previous government or inauguration ceremony of president. The State Duma is to discuss the matter within two weeks of the nomination and make a decision. The procedure of granting consent by the parliament is usually preceded by several days of comprehensive consultations and interviews of the candidate by the parliamentary factions. Should the State Duma decide to give the president its approval, the president may immediately sign the respective appointment decree. Should the State Duma refuse to give its approval, the president will have to nominate another (or the same) candidate within one week of the rejection of the previous candidate. However, in the event that the Duma rejects the president&#x27;s appointment to prime minister three times, he may dissolve the Duma, call for new elections and appoint a candidate for prime minister without its consent.

Should the State Duma reject candidates nominated by the president for three times consecutively, the president shall dissolve it and call a new election, while the prime minister shall be appointed by the president without participation of the Duma. The State Duma may not be dissolved on these grounds during the first year after parliamentary elections, the last six months of the incumbent president&#x27;s term, as well as in time of emergency, or war and in the event that the State Duma has initiated the impeachment of the incumbent president.

===Results of confirmations voting===

==Removal from office==
The prime minister may be dismissed by the president at any time at the president&#x27;s discretion. The prime minister may also tender his resignation to the president on his own initiative. The president may reject such resignation and oblige him to continue his work. The prime minister and the whole government are constitutionally obliged to resign after the inauguration of a newly elected president. At the same time, the president has the right to dismiss both the entire government together with the prime minister, and only prime minister, retaining the government.

Under certain circumstances, the president may also theoretically be forced to dismiss the chairman and the whole government under the pressure of the State Duma. For that to happen, the State Duma has to pass a censure motion against the government &quot;twice&quot; within three months. Normally, in this case the president has the right to choose whether to sack the government or to dissolve the Duma (and if the Duma passes the censure motion just once, the president may also choose &quot;not to agree&quot; with the decision of the Duma, which technically means that neither the cabinet nor the Duma are dismissed).

However, within one year after parliamentary elections the dissolution of the State Duma is impossible on these grounds. That is why in this case the president does not have any other option but to dismiss the government (even if he totally supports it).

==Term of office==
Initially, the term of office of the prime minister was not formally established. The head of the government served in his post for as long as the Emperor thought necessary.

In Soviet times, the term of the prime minister was also unlimited. The Chairman Council of Ministers of the Russian SFSR served in the position until he was dismissed by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

A term limit was introduced after the creation of the post of the president of Russia. Government became subordinate to the president, so the prime minister must resign along with the president, but may be appointed again. From 1991 to 1996, the maximum term of office of the prime minister was 5 years. After the new Constitution of Russia was created, the term of office of the president, and therefore the term of office of the prime minister, was shortened to 4 years. In 2012, after amendments to the Constitution the term of the president and prime minister was increased to 6 years.

==Acting prime minister==
===Temporary absence===
The Federal constitutional law &quot;On the Government of the Russian Federation&quot; says &quot;in the case of &quot;temporary&quot; absence of the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation, his duties are performed by one of the deputy chairmen of the Government of the Russian Federation in accordance with a written distribution of responsibilities&quot;. It&#x27;s automatically and President&#x27;s Executive Order is not required in that moment. The Federal constitutional law &quot;On the Government of the Russian Federation&quot; does not limit the term of &quot;temporary absence&quot; of the prime minister and the term of work of the acting prime minister.

There can be more than one First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, therefore written distribution of responsibilities is the most important document. The office of First Vice-Premier is not provisioned by Constitution and it is not separate office. The Chapter 6 of the Constitution of Russia says, that &quot;The Government of the Russian Federation consists of the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation, &quot;Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation&quot; and federal ministries&quot;.

===When the whole of government resigned===
The prime minister can leave his post at his own request or if it is impossible for him to exercise his powers. The Federal constitutional law &quot;On the Government of the Russian Federation&quot; says that the dismissal of the prime minister entails the resignation of the entire government. If the prime minister resigns, the president has the right to delegate his duties to one of his Vice-premiers. This situation cannot continue for more than two months – this period is reserved for the head of state to select a candidate for a new prime minister and submit it to The state Duma.

Very often, the acting prime minister later proposed the State Duma as the new prime minister.

==Succession of the presidency==

In case of the president&#x27;s death, resignation or impeachment, the prime minister becomes a temporary president until new presidential elections which must take place within three months. The prime minister as acting president may not dissolve the State Duma, announce a referendum or propose amendments to the Constitution.

The Russian Constitution does not explicitly specify who should become acting president if the prime minister is not appointed or is unable to perform his or her duties. Some believe that in the case of incapacity of the president and prime minister, the chairman of the Federation Council should become acting head of state. However, nowhere in the legislation is this fixed.

== List of prime ministers of Russia ==

Approximately 99 people have been head of the Russian government since its establishment in 1726. The chairman of government was a member of the Supreme Privy Council, which was created on 8 (19) February 1726 by Empress Catherine, and from 8 (20) September 1802 ministerial duties were allocated by the Committee of Ministers, which was established on in accordance with the proclamation of Emperor Alexander II. Beginning with Count Aleksandr Romanovich Vorontsov, the eldest of the officers was &quot;de facto&quot; chairman of the committee. Eight years after the inauguration of the manifest, the first &quot;de jure&quot; office holder was Count Nikolay Rumyantsev. The Council of Ministers was unofficially formed in October 1857, as a result of Emperor Alexander II&#x27;s reforms; its first session began on 19 (31) December 1857. Before the actual formation of that body on 12 (24) November 1861, the Emperor himself was in charge. The Council of Ministers consisted of chairman of the State Council and the Committee of Ministers, as well as high-ranking officers appointed by the Emperor. The first session ended on 11 (23) December 1882, after the number of files to the Council greatly decreased.

The Committee of Ministers functioned simultaneously with the second session of the Council of Ministers for six more months; Count Sergei Witte participated on both entities until the abolition of the committee on 23 April (5 May) 1906. Following that event, the duties of the committee were left to the Council of Ministers, until the formation of the Small Council in 1909, which also included deputy ministers. By the order of Emperor Nicholas II, the second session of the Council of Ministers began on 19 October (1 November) 1905, following the formation of the State Duma. Shortly after the February Revolution and the inception of the Russian Provisional Government on 2 (15) March 1917, Georgy Lvov from the Constitutional Democratic Party and Alexander Kerensky from the Socialist Revolutionary Party became joint Minister-Chairmen. The provisional Russian Republic was eventually replaced by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and the governmental body by the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, which was chaired from 1917 to 1924 by Vladimir Lenin. That body was renamed Council of Ministers following a decree of the Supreme Council on 23 March 1946.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin, as the President of the Russian Federation, was automatically appointed as the Head of Government of the Russian Federation in the first two years of his mandate. The latter body took the previous name &quot;Council of Ministers&quot;, the chairman of which became Viktor Chernomyrdin, replacing acting chairman Yegor Gaidar. According to the new constitution ratified on 25 December 1993, those two entities were separated. Since then, the head of that office takes the formal title &quot;Chairman of the Government&quot; or colloquially &quot;Prime Minister&quot; (the only actual prime minister was Valentin Pavlov). Chernomyrdin resumed chairing the government, followed up by non-partisans and acting office holders. On 8 May 2008, Vladimir Putin took the office for a second term, now as a member of United Russia. Current Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin took the office on 16 January 2020.

The youngest head of government by his accession to office was Count Karl-Fridrikh Golshteyn-Gottorpsky, at age 26, and the oldest Count Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy, at age 81.

The list below includes Prime Ministers since 1991.

<text>Zyzzyva is a genus of South American weevils, often found on or near palm trees. It was first described in 1922 by Thomas Lincoln Casey Jr., based on specimens obtained in Brazil by Herbert Huntingdon Smith.

Casey describes &quot;Zyzzyva ochreotecta&quot; in his book &quot;Memoirs on the Coleoptera, Volume 10&quot;: 
== Etymology ==
&quot;Zyzzyva&quot; has achieved notoriety for being the last word in several English-language dictionaries. Casey is commonly credited with naming the genus, although the etymology of the word is unclear. One theory is that the word was inspired by &quot;Zyzza&quot;, a former genus of leafhoppers. An entomologist at New York&#x27;s Museum of Natural History speculated that Casey made up the word as a joke, &quot;to have the last word.&quot;

== Species ==
There are three accepted species within this genus.

<text>In physics, black hole thermodynamics is the area of study that seeks to reconcile the laws of thermodynamics with the existence of black hole event horizons. As the study of the statistical mechanics of black-body radiation led to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics, the effort to understand the statistical mechanics of black holes has had a deep impact upon the understanding of quantum gravity, leading to the formulation of the holographic principle.

==Overview==
The second law of thermodynamics requires that black holes have entropy. If black holes carried no entropy, it would be possible to violate the second law by throwing mass into the black hole. The increase of the entropy of the black hole more than compensates for the decrease of the entropy carried by the object that was swallowed.

In 1972, Jacob Bekenstein conjectured that black holes should have an entropy proportional to the area of the event horizon, where by the same year, he proposed no-hair theorems.

In 1973 Bekenstein suggested formula_1 as the constant of proportionality, asserting that if the constant was not exactly this, it must be very close to it. The next year, in 1974, Stephen Hawking showed that black holes emit thermal Hawking radiation corresponding to a certain temperature (Hawking temperature). Using the thermodynamic relationship between energy, temperature and entropy, Hawking was able to confirm Bekenstein&#x27;s conjecture and fix the constant of proportionality at formula_2:

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the area of the event horizon, formula_5 is the Boltzmann constant, and formula_6 is the Planck length. 

This is often referred to as the Bekenstein–Hawking formula. The subscript BH either stands for &quot;black hole&quot; or &quot;Bekenstein–Hawking&quot;. The black hole entropy is proportional to the area of its event horizon formula_4. The fact that the black hole entropy is also the maximal entropy that can be obtained by the Bekenstein bound (wherein the Bekenstein bound becomes an equality) was the main observation that led to the holographic principle. This area relationship was generalized to arbitrary regions via the Ryu–Takayanagi formula, which relates the entanglement entropy of a boundary conformal field theory to a specific surface in its dual gravitational theory.

Although Hawking&#x27;s calculations gave further thermodynamic evidence for black hole entropy, until 1995 no one was able to make a controlled calculation of black hole entropy based on statistical mechanics, which associates entropy with a large number of microstates. In fact, so called &quot;no-hair&quot; theorems appeared to suggest that black holes could have only a single microstate. The situation changed in 1995 when Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa calculated the right Bekenstein–Hawking entropy of a supersymmetric black hole in string theory, using methods based on D-branes and string duality. Their calculation was followed by many similar computations of entropy of large classes of other extremal and near-extremal black holes, and the result always agreed with the Bekenstein–Hawking formula. However, for the Schwarzschild black hole, viewed as the most far-from-extremal black hole, the relationship between micro- and macrostates has not been characterized. Efforts to develop an adequate answer within the framework of string theory continue.

In loop quantum gravity (LQG) it is possible to associate a geometrical interpretation with the microstates: these are the quantum geometries of the horizon. LQG offers a geometric explanation of the finiteness of the entropy and of the proportionality of the area of the horizon. It is possible to derive, from the covariant formulation of full quantum theory (spinfoam) the correct relation between energy and area (1st law), the Unruh temperature and the distribution that yields Hawking entropy. The calculation makes use of the notion of dynamical horizon and is done for non-extremal black holes. There seems to be also discussed the calculation of Bekenstein–Hawking entropy from the point of view of loop quantum gravity. The current accepted microstate ensemble for black holes is the microcanonical ensemble. The partition function for black holes results in a negative heat capacity. In canonical ensembles, there is limitation for a positive heat capacity, whereas microcanonical ensembles can exist at a negative heat capacity.

== The laws of black hole mechanics ==
The four laws of black hole mechanics are physical properties that black holes are believed to satisfy. The laws, analogous to the laws of thermodynamics, were discovered by Jacob Bekenstein, Brandon Carter, and James Bardeen. Further considerations were made by Stephen Hawking.

===Statement of the laws===
The laws of black hole mechanics are expressed in geometrized units.

====The zeroth law====
The horizon has constant surface gravity for a stationary black hole.

==== The first law====
For perturbations of stationary black holes, the change of energy is related to change of area, angular momentum, and electric charge by

:formula_8

where formula_9 is the energy, formula_10 is the surface gravity, formula_4 is the horizon area, formula_12 is the angular velocity, formula_13 is the angular momentum, formula_14 is the electrostatic potential and formula_15 is the electric charge.

==== The second law ====

The horizon area is, assuming the weak energy condition, a non-decreasing function of time:
:formula_16

This &quot;law&quot; was superseded by Hawking&#x27;s discovery that black holes radiate, which causes both the black hole&#x27;s mass and the area of its horizon to decrease over time.

==== The third law ====

It is not possible to form a black hole with vanishing surface gravity. That is, formula_17 cannot be achieved.

=== Discussion of the laws ===

==== The zeroth law ====

The zeroth law is analogous to the zeroth law of thermodynamics, which states that the temperature is constant throughout a body in thermal equilibrium. It suggests that the surface gravity is analogous to temperature. &quot;T&quot; constant for thermal equilibrium for a normal system is analogous to formula_10 constant over the horizon of a stationary black hole.

==== The first law ====
The left side, formula_19, is the change in energy (proportional to mass). Although the first term does not have an immediately obvious physical interpretation, the second and third terms on the right side represent changes in energy due to rotation and electromagnetism. Analogously, the first law of thermodynamics is a statement of energy conservation, which contains on its right side the term formula_20.

==== The second law ====
The second law is the statement of Hawking&#x27;s area theorem. Analogously, the second law of thermodynamics states that the change in entropy in an isolated system will be greater than or equal to 0 for a spontaneous process, suggesting a link between entropy and the area of a black hole horizon. However, this version violates the second law of thermodynamics by matter losing (its) entropy as it falls in, giving a decrease in entropy. However, generalizing the second law as the sum of black hole entropy and outside entropy, shows that the second law of thermodynamics is not violated in a system including the universe beyond the horizon.

The generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSL) was needed to present the second law of thermodynamics as valid. This is because the second law of thermodynamics, as a result of the disappearance of entropy near the exterior of black holes, is not useful. The GSL allows for the application of the law because now the measurement of interior, common entropy is possible. The validity of the GSL can be established by studying an example, such as looking at a system having entropy that falls into a bigger, non-moving black hole, and establishing upper and lower entropy bounds for the increase in the black hole entropy and entropy of the system, respectively. One should also note that the GSL will hold for theories of gravity such as Einstein gravity, Lovelock gravity, or Braneworld gravity, because the conditions to use GSL for these can be met.

However, on the topic of black hole formation, the question becomes whether or not the generalized second law of thermodynamics will be valid, and if it is, it will have been proved valid for all situations. Because a black hole formation is not stationary, but instead moving, proving that the GSL holds is difficult. Proving the GSL is generally valid would require using quantum-statistical mechanics, because the GSL is both a quantum and statistical law. This discipline does not exist so the GSL can be assumed to be useful in general, as well as for prediction. For example, one can use the GSL to predict that, for a cold, non-rotating assembly of formula_21 nucleons, formula_22, where formula_23 is the entropy of a black hole and formula_24 is the sum of the ordinary entropy.

==== The third law ====
The third law of black hole thermodynamics is controversial. Specific counterexamples called 
extremal black holes fail to obey the rule. The classical 
third law of thermodynamics, known as the Nernst theorem, which says the entropy of a system must go to zero as the temperature goes to absolute zero is also not a universal law.
However the systems that fail the classical third law have not been realized in practice, leading to the suggestion that the extremal black holes may not represent the physics of black holes generally.

A weaker form of the classical third law known as the &quot;unattainability principle&quot; states that an infinite number of steps are required to put a system in to its ground state. This form of the third law does have an analog in black hole physics.

=== Interpretation of the laws ===
The four laws of black hole mechanics suggest that one should identify the surface gravity of a black hole with temperature and the area of the event horizon with entropy, at least up to some multiplicative constants. If one only considers black holes classically, then they have zero temperature and, by the no-hair theorem, zero entropy, and the laws of black hole mechanics remain an analogy. However, when quantum-mechanical effects are taken into account, one finds that black holes emit thermal radiation (Hawking radiation) at a temperature

:formula_25

From the first law of black hole mechanics, this determines the multiplicative constant of the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy, which is (in geometrized units)

:formula_26

which is the entropy of the black hole in Einstein&#x27;s general relativity. Quantum field theory in curved spacetime can be utilized to calculate the entropy for a black hole in any covariant theory for gravity, known as the Wald entropy.

==Critique==
While black hole thermodynamics (BHT) has been regarded as one of the deepest clues to a quantum theory of gravity, there remain a philosophical criticism that &quot;the analogy is not nearly as good as is commonly supposed&quot;, that it “is often based on a kind of caricature of thermodynamics” and &quot;it’s unclear what the systems in BHT are supposed to be&quot;.

These criticisms where reexamined in detail, ending with the opposite conclusion, &quot;stationary black holes are not &quot;analogous&quot; to thermodynamic systems: they &quot;are&quot; thermodynamic systems, in the fullest sense.&quot;

==Beyond black holes==
Gary Gibbons and Hawking have shown that black hole thermodynamics is more general than black holes—that cosmological event horizons also have an entropy and temperature.

More fundamentally, Gerard &#x27;t Hooft and Leonard Susskind used the laws of black hole thermodynamics to argue for a general holographic principle of nature, which asserts that consistent theories of gravity and quantum mechanics must be lower-dimensional. Though not yet fully understood in general, the holographic principle is central to theories like the AdS/CFT correspondence.

There are also connections between black hole entropy and fluid surface tension.

<text>The Pulteney Association was a small group of British investors who in 1792 purchased a large portion of the Western New York land tract known as the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The Pulteney Associates were Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet (1729–1805), a Scottish lawyer who owned nine-twelfths; William Hornby, former Governor of Bombay, who owned two-twelfths; and Patrick Colquhoun, a Scottish merchant with a one-twelfth share. Some of their heirs owned land in western New York into the 1920s, with the last parcel of The Pulteney Association property, 10 acres (40,000 m2), being sold in December 1926.

==History==
In 1788, following the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War, Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham purchased all of Massachusetts&#x27;s preemptive right to land in Western New York, some (the &quot;Phelps and Gorham Purchase&quot;). The United States forced the previous occupants, nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, to cede the lands as they had been allies of Great Britain. After Massachusetts&#x27; claim was settled, New York state intended to sell the land for development and settlement.

Phelps and Gorham were to pay $1,000,000 in three equal annual installments for this land, payable in certain Massachusetts securities that were then valued at 20 cents on the dollar. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, they took title only when they had extinguished the Indian title. Later in 1788, they were able to extinguish Indian title to all lands &quot;east&quot; of the Genesee River between Lake Ontario and the Pennsylvania border, as well as a tract by paralleling the west bank of the Genesee River (&quot;The Mill Yard Tract&quot;), totalling some .

In 1790, with the price of Massachusetts securities soaring, Phelps and Gorham became unable to pay the second installment on the purchase contract, and the preemptive right to lands &quot;west&quot; of the Genesee River reverted to Massachusetts. The state resold that right to Robert Morris, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, a financier of the American Revolution, and the wealthiest man in the United States. (See Holland Land Company, The Holland Purchase, and The Morris Reserve.) Phelps and Gorham received the deed to the lands east of the Genesee to which they had extinguished title, but they conveyed all of the remaining unsold land to Morris.

In 1792, Morris&#x27;s London agent, William Temple Franklin, grandson of Benjamin Franklin, sold of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase east of the Genesee River to The Pulteney Associates. The Pulteney Purchase, or the Genesee Tract, as it was also known, comprised all of the present counties of Ontario, Steuben and Yates, as well as portions of Allegany, Livingston, Monroe, Schuyler and Wayne counties. After Sir William Pulteney&#x27;s death in 1805, it was known as the Pulteney Estate.

The Pulteney Estate was managed by a series of agents, including:
* Cpt. Charles Williamson (1792–1801)
* Robert Troup (1801–1832)
** Represented by John Johnstone, John Heslop and Robert Scott, successively as sub-agents, until 1814
* Joeseph Fellows (1832–1871)
* Edward A. Kingsland (1871–1894)
* Judge Mason and Mr. Rose (1894–1900), Mr. Rose thereafter

<doc id="339353" wikidata="Q1612490" url="?curid=339353" title="Exosquad">
<text>Exosquad is an American science fiction animated television series created by Universal Cartoon Studios for MCA TV&#x27;s Universal Family Network syndicated programming block. The series ran for two complete seasons in syndication from 1993 to 1994. Reruns later aired on USA Network.
==Premise== 
At the beginning of the 22nd century, an interplanetary war takes place between humanity and Neosapiens, a fictional race artificially created as workers/slaves for the Terrans. The narrative generally follows Able Squad, an elite Terran unit of exoframe pilots, on their missions all over the Solar System.

== Plot ==
The series is set in the years 2119–2121 AD, decades after humanity (&quot;Terrans&quot;) has expanded beyond Earth, terraforming and colonizing Venus and Mars. These three planets are &quot;the Homeworlds&quot;, the core first of the Terran interplanetary state and later of Neosapien Commonwealth. Not all Terrans are affiliated with the Homeworlds, however: there is an independent faction of Pirate Clans, descendants of Terran criminals exiled to the Outer Planets who live off looted Homeworlds&#x27; space freighters. The first episode opens with the Earth Congress dispatching the entire Exofleet, humanity&#x27;s space-based military, to counter the Pirate threat.

With war with the Pirate Clans looming, an uprising begins among the Neosapiens, an artificial humanoid race coexisting with Terrans. In the back-story, the Neosapiens were used primarily as slaves during the colonization of Mars and Venus and therefore have been engineered to be physically stronger and better adapted to hostile environments than humans. Their mistreatment by Terrans led to the First Neosapien Revolt fifty years before the series&#x27; begin, which was mercilessly crushed but had brought some positive changes into their lives. Still not content with his fate, the Neosapien Governor of Mars, Phaeton, sets a new insurrection, codenamed &quot;Operation [Neosapien] Destiny&quot;, in motion as soon as the Exofleet leaves to chase after the Pirate Clans. The absence of the Exofleet is also a part of Phaeton&#x27;s plan as it enables the Neosapiens&#x27; capture of the Homeworlds without much effort.

The series follows the progress of Able Squad, an elite unit of exoframe pilots composed of J.T. Marsh, Nara Burns, Maggie Weston, Kaz Takagi, Alec DeLeon, Rita Torres, Wolf Bronsky, and Marsala. Their exploits unfold against the backdrop of the ongoing Neosapien War, as the squad participates in events often crucial to turning its tide. The show features a realistic outlook on war: many characters die in combat, military operations are carefully planned and reconnoitered in advance, and psychological effects of warfare are explored. For example, separate episodes detail Exofleet&#x27;s reconnaissance of Venus prior to its recapture, the actual liberation, and the repulse of the first Neosapien reconquest attempt. Moreover, even after Venus is retaken by Terrans, several episodes deal with the remaining Venusian resistance and Neosapien forces who hid across Venus, refusing to surrender and awaiting reinforcements.

The second season draws to a close with the defeat of the Neosapiens and the liberation of Earth, but it ends with a cliffhanger suggesting that a third season would describe a war against a new alien race, and that the Terrans and the Neosapiens would be forced to ally with each other.

Moreover, a clone of Phaeton was discovered in the final episodes by the Terrans, who were at a loss as to what to do about his existence as they didn&#x27;t want to unleash another Phaeton on society, but also didn&#x27;t wish to condemn the clone for his predecessor&#x27;s actions. However, the series was cancelled soon after the end of the second season so a third season was never made.

== Production ==

The show was conceived in 1989 by Jeff Segal, who had been head writer and story editor of &quot;Challenge of the GoBots&quot; for Hanna-Barbera Productions prior to joining Universal as President of Universal Cartoon Studios. Segal intended to create another robotic boy-action property. The show was originally entitled &quot;Exoforce&quot;. It was modified in 1993 and the title was changed to &quot;Exosquad&quot; (as a result of a trademark conflict) when Playmates Toys made a deal for the master toy license. Segal receives &quot;Created by&quot; credit on the show, however Will Meugniot contributed immensely to the look and style of the show, and Michael Edens, as story editor, supervised development of episodic stories and helped to guide the story arc.

&quot;Exosquad&quot; was among the first animated series by Universal Animation Studios (then known as &quot;Universal Cartoon Studios&quot;) and was created under influence of anime imported from Japan. As a result, its complex story line covered a large number of topics from war through romance to genetic engineering and was able to appeal to a broad audience. Although the first season ran for only thirteen episodes in 1993, the rising popularity of the show allowed Universal to make the second one three times as long. In its second season, &quot;Exosquad&quot; was put together with another action series from Universal, &quot;Monster Force&quot;. The series animation was provided for Universal by AKOM in South Korea.

As the second season progressed, some characters, according to Michael Edens, &quot;took on a life of [their] own&quot;: for example, Nara Burns killing Phaeton and the Neosapien Thrax becoming a major recurring character after his initial appearance were not pre-planned. Another character, Alec DeLeon, was supposed to perish in the destruction of Mars but the Universal executives strongly opposed it, so he was killed several episodes later, on the Moon, only to be promptly resurrected in a Neo Mega body.

The show was purportedly cancelled after 52 episodes because at that time, many independent production companies were being taken over by larger networks, who wanted to produce their own content. &quot;Exosquad&quot; was eventually moved to poor time slots, such as 4 a.m., until the ratings were no longer sufficient to sustain it. The final episode detailed the post-war political and social climate prevalent in the &quot;Exosquad&quot; universe, and closed with J.T. Marsh engaging a group of alien space vessels, whose exact nature was to be explained in the third season or a feature movie. Michael Edens later remarked that the staff originally planned the aliens to be insectoid and that the Pirates&#x27; dark matter, Dr. Ketzer&#x27;s experiments, and the unactivated clone of Phaeton would have played a great role in fighting them. The idea of a film based on &quot;Exosquad&quot; was being promoted by executive producer Jeff Segal, and it was also planned to expand the fictional universe with a spin-off series, then codenamed &quot;Exo-Pirates&quot;. Both initiatives were scrapped with the cancellation of the third season.

== Themes ==
&quot;Exosquad&quot; had a very serious approach to the plot with several intertwined narrative threads and a number of characters displaying a full spectrum of human emotions, relationships and experiences, such as friendship, love, hatred, tragedy, treachery, and responsibility for others. Michael Edens, the story writer and editor in the second season, credited the show&#x27;s realism for much of its success. Prejudice and racism are recurring themes in the series, as both Terrans and Neosapiens are shown to harbor hatred and a sense of superiority towards each other. Interplanetary politics and space space war typical for military science fiction were presented with an assumption of the fictional future history of the Solar System up to that point. The Able Squad&#x27;s duties became more spread out as the second season unfolded, and there were separate story arcs on Mars, Venus, Earth, and in space. Espionage and intrigue were often featured instead of straightforward battles.

Will Meugniot, the executive producer of the series, once compared anime series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; and &quot;Exosquad&quot; to the Pacific and the European Theaters of World War II, respectively. Michael Edens recalled in an interview that the plot was supposed to remind of the Second World War, too, for example with the Neosapien reconquest attempt of Venus, capture of the Moon and battle for Chicago paralleling the battles of the Bulge, Okinawa, and Berlin, respectively.

The series is named after the multi-purpose mecha-like powered exoskeletons mostly utilized as armored combat vehicles or reinforced body armor by the characters.

== Home media ==

The first season of &quot;Exosquad&quot; was released on seven VHS cassettes shortly after its original run, and in 2007, it was made available on Hulu video on demand service. The complete second season was published on Hulu in February 2009. The first season has been made available on Zune Marketplace. Universal Studios Home Entertainment released the 13 episodes comprising the first season of &quot;Exosquad&quot; on DVD on April 14, 2009, as a two-disc set. Only three episodes in this set (&quot;Seeds of Deception&quot;, &quot;Resist&quot;, and &quot;Betrayal&quot;) have the actual Season One opening; the other ten episodes are incorrectly shown with the Season Two opening. The series became available on Peacock on July 15, 2020.

== Merchandise and other media ==

Between 1993 and 1996, Playmates Toys produced a line of action figures and model kits of exoframes and spaceships featured in the television series. The descriptions of the toys are a major source of &quot;Exosquad&quot; universe lore. The toys were often compared to the popular &quot;Robotech&quot; franchise, and Playmates acquired the license to &quot;Robotech&quot; to produce both toy lines under the same label, spawning rumors of a possible crossover. This possibility was considered by the authors but later abandoned. Today the Exosquad toys are considered highly collectible along with their boxes.

A Sega Genesis video game under the same title was developed by Appaloosa Interactive and published by Playmates in 1995. The series was also adapted into a comic book by Topps Comics in 1994. Additionally, an interactive movie book was released, as well as a board game.

<text>David Khari Webber Chappelle ( ; born August 24, 1973) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. He starred in and co-created the satirical comedy sketch series &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; (2003–2006) before quitting in the middle of production during the third season. After a hiatus, Chappelle returned to performing stand-up comedy across the U.S. By 2006, Chappelle was called the &quot;comic genius of America&quot; by &quot;Esquire&quot; and, in 2013, &quot;the best&quot; by a &quot;Billboard&quot; writer. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him No. 9 in their &quot;50 Best Stand Up Comics of All Time&quot;.

Chappelle has appeared in various films, including &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; (1993), &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1996), &quot;Con Air&quot; (1997), &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; (1998), &quot;Blue Streak&quot; (1999), &quot;Undercover Brother&quot; (2001), &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot; (2005), &quot;Chi-Raq&quot; (2015) and &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (2018). His first lead role was in the 1998 comedy film &quot;Half Baked&quot;, which he co-wrote. Chappelle also starred in the ABC comedy series &quot;Buddies&quot; (1993). In 2016, he signed a $20-million-per-release comedy-special deal with Netflix and released six stand-up specials under the deal.

He has received numerous accolades, including six Emmy Awards, six Grammy Awards, and the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2019, which is presented by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts as America&#x27;s highest comedy honor. Chappelle has received two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2016 and 2020. Chappelle received six Grammy Awards for Best Comedy Album for &quot;The Age of Spin&quot; (2018), &quot;Equanimity &amp; The Bird Revelation&quot; (2019), &quot;Sticks &amp; Stones&quot; (2019) and &quot;The Closer&quot; (2021) and &quot;What&#x27;s in a Name?&quot; (2022), and &quot;The Dreamer&quot; (2023).

== Early life and education ==
David Khari Webber Chappelle was born on August 24, 1973, in Washington, D.C. His father, William David Chappelle III, was a professor of vocal performance and the dean of students at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. His mother, Yvonne Seon (, formerly Chappelle), worked for Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, is a Unitarian Universalist minister, and worked as a professor and university administrator at several institutions including Wright State University and Prince George&#x27;s Community College. Chappelle has a stepmother and a stepbrother.

Chappelle grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland, and attended Woodlin Elementary School. His parents were politically active, and family house visitors included Pete Seeger and Johnny Hartman. Hartman predicted Chappelle would be a comedian and, around this time, Chappelle&#x27;s comic inspiration came from Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor. After his parents separated, Chappelle stayed in Washington with his mother while spending summers with his father in Ohio. In high school he worked as an usher in Ford&#x27;s Theatre. He attended DC&#x27;s Eastern High School for a short time before transferring to Duke Ellington School of the Arts, where he studied theater arts, graduating in 1991.

== Career ==
=== 1990–2002: Early career and breakthrough ===
Chappelle was featured in a montage of random people telling jokes in the first episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot;, airing on September 13, 1990. Following his high school graduation, Chappelle moved to New York City to pursue a career as a comedian. He performed at Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theater in front of the &quot;Amateur Night&quot; audience, but he was booed off stage. Chappelle described the experience as the moment that gave him the courage to continue his show business aspirations. He quickly made a name for himself on the New York comedy circuit, even performing in the city&#x27;s parks. In addition to weekend stand-up gigs, he honed his craft at Monday night &quot;open mic&quot; performances at places such as the Boston Comedy Club on West 3rd Street, as late as the summer 1994. In 1992, he won critical and popular acclaim for his television appearance in Russell Simmons&#x27; &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot; on HBO. It was his appearance on this show that allowed his popularity to truly begin rising, eventually allowing him to become a regular guest on late-night television shows such as &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Whoopi Goldberg nicknamed him &quot;The Kid&quot;. At 19, he made his film debut as &quot;Ahchoo&quot; in Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;Star Search&quot; three times but lost to competing comedian Lester Barrie; Chappelle later joked about becoming more successful than Barrie. The same year, Chappelle was offered the role of Benjamin Buford &quot;Bubba&quot; Blue in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. Concerned the character was demeaning and the movie would bomb, he turned down the part. He parodied the film in the 1997 short &quot;Bowl of Pork&quot;, where a dim-witted black man is responsible for the Rodney King beating, the LA riots and O. J. Simpson&#x27;s being accused of murder. Chappelle played another supporting role in an early Doug Liman film, &quot;Getting In&quot;, in 1994. At age 19, he was the opening act for R&amp;B soul singer Aretha Franklin.

Chappelle attracted the attention of television network executives and developed numerous pilots but none were picked up for development into a series. In 1995, he made a guest appearance on an episode of ABC&#x27;s popular sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. The storyline had Chappelle and real-life friend and comedian Jim Breuer ask Tim Taylor for advice on their girlfriends. The characters&#x27; single outing in the episode proved so popular that ABC decided to give them their own spin-off sitcom titled &quot;Buddies&quot;. However, after taping a pilot episode, Breuer was fired and replaced with actor Christopher Gartin. &quot;Buddies&quot; premiered in March 1996 to disappointing ratings and the show was canceled after only five episodes out of 13 that had been produced.

After the failure of &quot;Buddies&quot;, Chappelle starred in another pilot. According to Chappelle, the network was uncomfortable with the African-American cast and wanted white actors added. Chappelle resisted and subsequently accused the network of racism. Shortly afterward Chappelle&#x27;s father died and, after returning to Ohio, he considered leaving the entertainment business.

He later appeared as a stand-up insult comic who targets patrons of a nightclub in the 1996 comedy &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; starring Eddie Murphy, one of his major comedic influences. He had a minor role in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Con Air&quot;. At the beginning of 1998, he did a stand-up performance for HBO &quot;Comedy Half-Hour&quot;. That same year, he appeared in &quot;Pilots and Pens Lost&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;″s sixth season, in which he and the executives of the show&#x27;s unnamed television network satirize the treatment that scriptwriters and show creators were subjected to, as well as the executives&#x27; knee-jerk tendencies toward racial stereotypes.

He and Neal Brennan co-wrote the 1998 cult stoner film &quot;Half Baked&quot;, Chappelle&#x27;s first starring role, about a group of marijuana-smoking friends trying to get their other friend out of jail. It made money at the box office and remains a classic &quot;stoner&quot; film, a genre that includes the &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&quot; films as well as more recent fare like Judd Apatow&#x27;s &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;. In December 1998, Chappelle appeared as Tom Hanks&#x27; character&#x27;s friend and confidant in &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;. In 1999, he appeared in the Martin Lawrence film &quot;Blue Streak&quot;.

In 2000, Chappelle recorded his first hour-long HBO special, &quot;Dave Chappelle: Killin&#x27; Them Softly&quot;, in Washington, D.C. He also starred alongside Norm Macdonald in the 2000 comedy film &quot;Screwed&quot;. He followed this with an appearance as &quot;Conspiracy Brother&quot; in the 2002 racial satire &quot;Undercover Brother&quot;. During the early 2000s, Chappelle was a member of the Spitkicker artist collective, along with many hip-hop artists like De La Soul and Talib Kweli.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; ===
In 2003, Chappelle debuted his own weekly sketch comedy show on Comedy Central called &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;. The show parodied many aspects of American culture, including racial stereotypes, politics and pop culture. Along with comedy sketches, the show also featured musical performances by mostly hip-hop and soul artists. He promoted the work of other black comedians as well, most notably Paul Mooney and Charlie Murphy.

Due to the show&#x27;s popularity, Comedy Central&#x27;s new parent company Viacom offered Chappelle a $55 million contract (giving Chappelle a share of DVD sales) to continue production of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; for two more years while allowing him to do side projects. Chappelle has said that sketches are not his favorite form of comedy, and that the show&#x27;s format was similar to short films.

In June 2004, based on the popularity of the &quot;Rick James&quot; sketch, it was announced that Chappelle was in talks to portray James in a biopic from Paramount Pictures, also owned by Viacom. James&#x27; estate disagreed with the proposed comical tone of the film and put a halt to the talks.

That same month, Chappelle recorded his second comedy special, this time airing on Showtime, &quot;Dave Chappelle: For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;, at San Francisco&#x27;s Fillmore Auditorium, where Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and Robin Williams had performed.

==== Season 3 problems ====

Season 3 was scheduled to begin airing on May 31, 2005, but earlier in May, Chappelle surprised fans and the entertainment industry when he abruptly left during production and took a trip to South Africa. Chappelle said that he was unhappy with the direction the show had taken, and expressed in an interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine his need for reflection in the face of tremendous stress. Chappelle said on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; that the death of his father seven years prior influenced his decision to go to South Africa. By throwing himself into his work, he had not taken a chance to mourn his father&#x27;s death. He also said the rumors that he was in drug or psychiatric treatment only persuaded him to stay in South Africa. 

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired on February 3, 2006, Chappelle stated that burnout, losing his creative control, and a work environment that was uncomfortable, were some of the reasons he left the show. He did not rule out returning to &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; to &quot;finish what we started&quot;, but promised that he would not return without changes to the production. Chappelle expressed disdain at the possibility of his material from the unfinished third season being aired, saying that to do so would be &quot;a bully move&quot;, and that he would not return to the show if Comedy Central were to air the unfinished material. On July 9, 2006, Comedy Central aired the first episode of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show: The Lost Episodes&quot;. After the DVD release, Chappelle was interviewed by Anderson Cooper on CNN and reiterated he would not return to &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;. An uncensored DVD release of the episodes was made available on July 25.

Chappelle&#x27;s abrupt departure from the show continues to be a focus of interviews and profiles of him and of his own comedy. His decision to quit the show meant walking away from a $50 million contract with Comedy Central and forming a rift with longtime collaborator Neal Brennan. The show still plays in syndication on several television networks, despite the relatively small number of episodes compared to most American syndicated television programs. In &quot;Bird Revelation&quot;, Chappelle draws an analogy between his departure and the book &quot;Pimp&quot;, the memoir of Iceberg Slim.

=== 2004: &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot; ===
Chappelle was the star and a producer of the Michel Gondry-directed documentary &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot;, which chronicles his hosting a free concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn on September 18, 2004. Several musical artists, including Kanye West, The Roots, Erykah Badu, Mos Def, Dead Prez and Jill Scott, are featured in the movie both performing in the concert and in conversation off-stage; Chappelle brought Yellow Springs residents to Brooklyn at his own expense. Another highlight of the event was the temporary reunion of 1990s hip-hop group The Fugees.

Chappelle toured several cities in February and March 2006 to promote the film under the name &quot;Block Party All-Stars Featuring Dave Chappelle&quot;. Universal Pictures&#x27; genre division, Rogue Pictures, released the film in the U.S. on March 3, 2006. It was a success, grossing a total of $11.7 million on a $3 million budget.

=== 2005–2015: Infrequent comedy appearances ===
Chappelle has been known to make impromptu and unannounced appearances at comedy venues, and continued to do so following his post–&quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; return to stand-up comedy. In June 2005, Chappelle performed impromptu stand-up shows in Los Angeles, then went on a tour that began in Newport, Kentucky, not far from his Ohio home. On May 11, 2006, he made a prearranged, but quietly marketed, surprise appearance at Towson University&#x27;s annual Tigerfest celebration. He made another appearance on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Def Poetry&quot;, where he performed two poems, titled &quot;Fuck Ashton Kutcher&quot; and &quot;How I Got the Lead on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;&quot;.
In April 2007, Chappelle set a stand-up endurance record at the Laugh Factory Sunset Strip comedy club, beating comedian Dane Cook&#x27;s record of three hours and 50 minutes. In December of the same year, Chappelle broke his own record with a time of six hours and 12 minutes. Cook reclaimed the record in January 2008, with a time of seven hours. On November 19, 2009, Chappelle performed at the Laugh Factory again, where it was speculated that he would attempt to take back the record. However, according to the club owner, he was disqualified after he left the stage five hours into his routine. Chappelle again appeared on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; and, in celebration of the show&#x27;s 200th episode, he interviewed the show&#x27;s usual host, James Lipton. The episode aired on November 11, 2008. He appeared again on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; in 2013, for its 250th episode. In February 2009, Chappelle did a four-hour set at Comic Strip Live in New York. In August 2011, Chappelle appeared at Comedy Jam in San Francisco.

In August 2013, Chappelle returned to full-time touring stand-up, as a headliner, when he was featured during the Oddball Comedy &amp; Curiosity festival. Sponsored by Funny or Die, Chappelle co-headlined with comedy act Flight of the Conchords. During a stop in Hartford, Chappelle walked off the stage due to heckling from the crowd that lasted throughout his entire performance. The heckling was so raucous that it drowned out Chappelle&#x27;s voice over the P.A. system and included chants of &quot;White Power&quot;, a line used in a &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; episode, that was viewed as wildly uncalled-for and out-of-context by other audience members who later wrote about the event. A few days later, Chappelle stopped in Chicago for a performance. The comedy website ComedyHype.com acquired and released audio of him on stage responding to the heckling. Chappelle referenced the Hartford incident, stating that &quot;young, white, alcoholic[s]&quot; should be blamed for the prior incident, that he hoped North Korea would bomb Hartford, that in the future he would not stop in Hartford for gas, and finally summarizing his feelings on the situation by saying, &quot;Fuck Hartford!&quot; However, in August 2014 Chappelle returned to Hartford for a surprise appearance at the 2014 Oddball Festival and received standing ovations during his set.

In June 2014, Chappelle made his first major New York City appearance in eleven years, performing ten nights at Radio City Music Hall. Chappelle promoted the dates by appearing on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. In 2015, Chappelle appeared in the Spike Lee film &quot;Chi-Raq&quot;, his first film role in 13 years.

=== 2016–2019: Career comeback ===
On November 12, 2016, Chappelle made his hosting debut on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; the weekend after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election. The show also featured A Tribe Called Quest as the musical guest. In his opening monologue, Chappelle tackled Trump and the election head on. He ended his monologue by stating, &quot;I&#x27;m wishing Donald Trump luck, and I&#x27;m going to give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too.&quot; His performance on &quot;SNL&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike. At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, he received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his appearance. He donated the Emmy to his former high school while filming an episode of Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s Netflix series, &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot; (Season 10, Episode 2: &quot;Nobody Says, &#x27;I Wish I Had A Camera&#x27;&quot;).

On November 21, 2016, Netflix announced that they would be releasing three new stand-up comedy specials from Chappelle in 2017, with Chappelle being paid $20 million per special. The first two specials were released on Netflix on March 21, 2017, and hail directly from Chappelle&#x27;s personal comedy vault. &quot;Deep in the Heart of Texas&quot; was filmed at Austin City Limits Live in April 2015, and &quot;The Age of Spin&quot; was filmed at the Hollywood Palladium in March 2016. The specials marked the comedian&#x27;s first concert specials released in 12 years, and proved to be an immediate success as Netflix announced a month later that they were the most viewed comedy specials in Netflix&#x27;s history.
The third special, &quot;Equanimity&quot;, was filmed in September 2017 at the Warner Theater in Washington, D.C., and then on November 20, 2017, Chappelle filmed a fourth special, &quot;The Bird Revelation&quot;, at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles. On December 22, 2017, Netflix announced the expansion of the deal to include &quot;The Bird Revelation&quot;, which was released with &quot;Equanimity&quot; on December 31.

In January 2018 at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, Chappelle received a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for his first two 2017 specials &quot;The Age of Spin &amp; Deep in the Heart of Texas&quot;. In September 2018, Chappelle&#x27;s &quot;Equanimity&quot; special received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded). In October 2018, Chappelle returned to the big screen as &quot;Noodles&quot;, Jackson Maine&#x27;s best friend and retired musician in Bradley Cooper&#x27;s directorial debut, a remake of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. The film was a massive critical and commercial success. He was nominated along with the cast for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture. In 2018, Chappelle and Jon Stewart joined forces for a duo comedy tour in the United States, and across the United Kingdom. He has also collaborated with Aziz Ansari for three stand-up shows in Austin, Texas, at the Paramount Theater.

In February 2019, Chappelle was nominated for and won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for &quot;Equanimity&quot; and &quot;Bird Revelation&quot;.

In 2019, Chappelle was chosen to receive the annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor presented by John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. President of the Kennedy Center Deborah Rutter stated, &quot;Dave is the embodiment of Mark Twain&#x27;s observation that &#x27;against the assault of humor, nothing can stand&#x27;... and for three decades, Dave has challenged us to see hot-button issues from his entirely original yet relatable experience.&quot; The set of people honoring Chappelle included Jon Stewart, Bradley Cooper, Morgan Freeman, Lorne Michaels, Tiffany Haddish, Aziz Ansari, Sarah Silverman, Neal Brennan, Q-Tip, Mos Def, John Legend, Frederic Yonnet, Erykah Badu, Common, &quot;SNL&quot; cast members Kenan Thompson, Michael Che and Colin Jost, as well as Eddie Murphy. The Prize was awarded at the Kennedy Center gala on October 27, 2019. The ceremony was broadcast on PBS January 7, 2020. The Mayor of the District of Columbia, Muriel Bowser, declared the day of the award ceremony &quot;Dave Chappelle Day&quot; in Washington, D.C.

On August 26, 2019, Chappelle&#x27;s fifth Netflix special, &quot;Dave Chappelle: Sticks &amp; Stones&quot;, was released. The special garnered controversy, and backlash for jokes about abuse allegations against singers Michael Jackson and R. Kelly, as well as for jokes about the LGBT community and cancel culture. The following year, &quot;Sticks &amp; Stones&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album.

=== 2020–present ===
On June 12, 2020, Netflix released &quot;8:46&quot;, a 27-minute and 20-second video of newly recorded stand-up by Chappelle on the YouTube channel &quot;Netflix Is a Joke&quot;. The private event was held outdoors on June 6, 2020, in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where audience members observed social distancing rules and wore masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The title was chosen in reference to the 8 minutes and 46 seconds that police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on the neck of George Floyd, leading to his death. Chappelle touches on Floyd&#x27;s murder and subsequent protests and takes aim at Don Lemon, Laura Ingraham and Candace Owens.

Expanding on the concept of the socially distanced comedy presentation, beginning with a pair of performances in late June 2020 and officially kicking off with a Fourth of July celebration, &quot;Chappelle and friends&quot; hosted what became known as &quot;Chappelle Summer Camp&quot;, which brought live performances to a masked, socially distanced audience at Wirrig Pavilion, in Yellow Springs, Ohio. These shows featured regular performances from comedians Michelle Wolf, Mohammed Amer and Donnell Rawlings, as well as Chappelle&#x27;s tour DJ, DJ Trauma and frequent special guests including Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, Louis C.K., Sarah Silverman, David Letterman, Bill Burr, Michael Che, Brian Regan, Chris Tucker, Kevin Hart, Ali Wong, Trevor Noah, Tiffany Haddish, with musical guests John Mayer, Common, and many others. After several shows in July, some issues arose from neighbors&#x27; complaints of noise and disturbances, local zoning officials granted a special variance allowing the performances to continue through October 4, 2020. The Chappelle Summer Camp series of shows ended suddenly September 25, 2020, when Elaine Chappelle announced in a closed Facebook fan group that there had been a possible COVID-19 exposure in their inner circle, and all further performances were canceled.

It was announced that Chappelle would return to host &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; the weekend of the 2020 United States presidential election, his second time giving a post-presidential election monologue. Due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the vote count, the results were delayed and announced earlier that Saturday. In response to unfounded allegations that Joe Biden&#x27;s presidency had been stolen from Donald Trump, Chappelle&#x27;s offered jokes ranging from Trump&#x27;s handling of the pandemic to his resulting legacy, and the political future of the United States, in his 16-minute opening monologue:

Critics and audiences praised the monologue describing it as &quot;scathing&quot;, &quot;illuminating&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot;.

In December 2020, Chappelle&#x27;s company, &quot;Iron Table Holdings&quot; purchased a fire station near his Yellow Springs, Ohio, home, with plans to convert it into a comedy club. He also retrofitted a mechanic&#x27;s garage in the same village into a clubhouse, and dubbed it &quot;The Shack&quot;, for podcasting.

On October 5, 2021, Chappelle starred in his sixth Netflix special &quot;The Closer&quot;. In &quot;The Closer&quot;, Chappelle made jokes about gay and transgender people, particularly transgender women, that some considered transphobic. Simultaneously, Chappelle argued that he was not anti-transgender, bringing up his opposition to North Carolina&#x27;s anti-transgender bathroom laws and his friendship with the late Daphne Dorman. The special was met with some backlash, including from students of Chappelle&#x27;s alma mater Duke Ellington School. On October 20, Netflix employees organized a walkout demonstrating their support of the transgender community and demanding that &quot;The Closer&quot; be taken off of Netflix. CEO Ted Sarandos acknowledged that &quot;storytelling has real impact in the real world&quot; but refused to take down the special, stating that he &quot;does not believe it falls into hate speech&quot;. In November 2021, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; lampooned the controversy during its Weekend Update segment, stating, &quot;A Washington, D.C. art school is postponing renaming its theater, after alumni Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Netflix controversy. Well, of course, because God forbid, you should name a building after someone problematic in Washington, D.C.&quot; In summer of 2022, Chappelle announced that he would not give his name to the Duke Ellington School theater, instead insisting it should be named the Theater for Artistic Freedom and Expression.

&quot;Dave Chappelle: Live in Real Life&quot;, a documentary covering Chappelle&#x27;s concerts in Yellow Springs during the COVID-19 pandemic, premiered at Tribeca Film Festival in June 2021, followed by a series of roadshow events in the United States and Canada and a limited theatrical release on November 19, 2021.

In the early hours of May 4, 2022, Chappelle was performing at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California, as part of the Netflix Is a Joke Festival, where he was tackled onstage by a member of the audience, who was swiftly subdued by security. The attacker was later found to have been armed with a replica handgun containing a knife blade. Chappelle&#x27;s 4-night stint at the Hollywood Bowl ties him with Monty Python for the most headlined shows by a comedian at the venue.

On November 12, 2022, Chappelle hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the third time. On February 5, 2023, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for &quot;The Closer&quot;.

On December 31, 2023, Netflix released Chappelle&#x27;s latest special, &quot;The Dreamer&quot;, which debuted at No. 5 on the chart with 2.2 million views.

On January 18, 2025, Chappelle hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in its first show of 2025, marking Chappelle&#x27;s fourth time hosting. His 17-minute monologue included commentary on recent events, including the January 2025 Southern California wildfires, Jimmy Carter&#x27;s death, and Donald Trump&#x27;s reelection to the United States presidency.

== Influences ==
In his interview with &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; host James Lipton, he said that his biggest influences in comedy are Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Mort Sahl, Chris Rock, Paul Mooney, and Mel Blanc.

When asked about his earliest influence in comedy, Chappelle said:

When asked about the biggest influence on him in comedy, Chappelle spoke of Richard Pryor:

== Awards and accolades ==
Chappelle has received many awards and nominations for his work in stand-up and television including three consecutive Grammy Awards for Best Comedy Album. He has also received five Primetime Emmy Awards and one Screen Actors Guild Award nomination along with the ensemble of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;.

In 2017, Columbia, South Carolina, Mayor Steven Benjamin declared February 3 &quot;Dave Chappelle Day&quot; when Chappelle spoke at the Chappelle Auditorium at Allen University, a building named after his great-grandfather, Bishop William David Chappelle, who worked at the university.

In 2019, Chappelle was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Those to honor Chappelle at the event included Jon Stewart, Bradley Cooper, Aziz Ansari, Sarah Silverman, Chris Tucker, Frederic Yonnet and Lorne Michaels. The award ceremony was turned into a television special and released on Netflix and received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded) nomination.

His work, as well as that of Margaret Cho, was also the subject of a book by Canadian dramaturg Elizabeth Ludwig, &quot;American Stand-Up and Sketch Comedy&quot;, that was published at the end of 2010.

==Activism and advocacy==
=== Philanthropy ===
In 2004, he donated his time to Seeds of Peace International Camp, a camp located in Otisfield, Maine, which brings together young leaders from communities in conflict.

Chappelle supports his high school, Duke Ellington School of the Arts. He has financially contributed to the school over the years, visited and gave a commencement speech. During his acceptance speech at the 2017 Emmy Awards, Chappelle gave a shout-out to D.C. Public Schools. In November 2021, the school was set to rename their auditorium in Chappelle&#x27;s honor. Following controversy in response to jokes made in &quot;The Closer&quot;, the renaming ceremony was delayed until April 2022. Instead, Chappelle made an unannounced stop at the school to host a school assembly and Q&amp;A session, asking only students who had an issue with Chappelle to come forward to ask questions. Following the assembly, the school decided to go forward with renaming the auditorium, respecting the wishes of school co-founder Peggy Cooper Cafritz.

=== Politics ===
Chappelle endorsed Andrew Yang in the 2020 United States presidential election.

In December 2021, Chappelle told the Yellow Springs, Ohio, village council that he would cancel his planned business investments, including his restaurant and comedy club, if it approved a zoning change to allow a multifamily affordable housing project. The affordable housing had been negotiated between the village and the developer as a condition of approval for its plan to build 143 single-unit homes. Chapelle stated that he is not against affordable housing; he is against &quot;the poorly vetted, cookie-cutter, sprawl-style development deal which has little regard for the community, culture and infrastructure of the village&quot;. On February 7, 2022, he again spoke up against the zoning change at the council meeting held to vote on the approval, calling the council &quot;clowns&quot; and reminding them that his business was worth $65 million a year. The council failed to approve the change, deadlocking at 2–2, with one recusal. He has also criticized the city of San Francisco in a stand-up.

During an October 19, 2023 show in Boston, Chappelle described Israel&#x27;s actions during the Israel–Hamas war as war crimes. Chappelle also condemned the United States for aiding Israel and condemned Hamas for its October 7th attacks. The audience reaction to Chappelle&#x27;s statements was mixed; some audience members cheered, some heckled, and others walked out. In May 2024, in an appearance in Abu Dhabi, Chappelle said that &quot;genocide is striking the Gaza Strip amid the Israel-Hamas war&quot;, while urging Americans to fight antisemitism so Jews do not feel like they need to be protected by Israel. During his January 19, 2025, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; monologue, he exhorted President Donald Trump: &quot;Whether they like you or not, they’re all counting on you. Please do better next time. Do not forget your humanity and please have empathy for displaced people, whether they’re in the Palisades or Palestine&quot;.

Chapelle headlined a campaign event for actor Hill Harper, who was running against Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin in the Democratic primary ahead of the Michigan&#x27;s 2024 U.S. Senate election, at Saint Andrews Hall in Detroit.

== Personal life ==
Chappelle married Elaine Mendoza Erfe in 2001. The couple have two sons and one daughter. They live on a farm near Yellow Springs, Ohio. Chappelle also owned several houses in Xenia, Ohio. He told Yellow Springs&#x27; residents in September 2006: 

Chappelle converted to Islam when he was 17. He told &quot;Time&quot; magazine in May 2005:
 Chappelle appears in a video explaining the religious history of the Well of Zamzam in Mecca. He has also explained that his faith helped him use his career to benefit people.

Chappelle, born into slavery in 1857, served as a president of Allen University and led a delegation of African Americans who met President Woodrow Wilson at the White House. His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Palmer was a member of the South Carolina Legislature, then majority black, during Reconstruction. His grand-uncle W. D. Chappelle Jr. was a physician and surgeon who opened the People&#x27;s Infirmary around 1915, a small hospital and surgery practice in Columbia, South Carolina, when segregation prevented many African Americans from having access to healthcare.

<text>John Daniel Ehrlichman (; March 20, 1925 – February 14, 1999) was an American political aide who served as White House Counsel and Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs under President Richard Nixon. Ehrlichman was an important influence on Nixon&#x27;s domestic policy, coaching him on issues and enlisting his support for environmental initiatives.

Ehrlichman was a key figure in events leading to the Watergate break-in and the ensuing Watergate scandal, for which he was convicted of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and perjury, and served a year and a half in prison.

==Early life and education==
Ehrlichman was born in Tacoma, Washington, the son of Lillian Catherine (née Danielson) and Rudolph Irwin Ehrlichman. His family practiced Christian Science (his father was a convert from Judaism). In 1931, the family moved to southern California. He was an Eagle Scout, recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, graduated from Santa Monica High School in 1942, and attended the University of California, Los Angeles, for a year prior to his military service.

==Military service and early career==
At age 18 in 1943, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces.

In World War II, Ehrlichman received the Distinguished Flying Cross as a lead B-24 navigator in the Eighth Air Force. Earlier in the war, his father joined the Royal Canadian Air Force as an instructor pilot in 1940 and was killed in a crash in Torbay, Newfoundland (later Canada, from 1949) on May 6, 1942.

Taking advantage of the G.I. Bill, Ehrlichman returned to UCLA and graduated in 1948 with a B.A. in political science; he graduated from Stanford Law School in 1951.

After a short time back in southern California, Ehrlichman joined a Seattle law firm, becoming a partner, practicing as a land-use lawyer, noted for his expertise in urban land use and zoning. His uncle was president of the Municipal League, and Ehrlichman was active, supporting its efforts to clean up Lake Washington and to improve the civic infrastructure of Seattle and King County. He remained a practicing lawyer until 1969, when he entered politics full-time. His experience in environmentalism proved a major asset in his White House career.

==Political life==

Ehrlichman worked on Nixon&#x27;s unsuccessful 1960 presidential campaign and his unsuccessful 1962 California gubernatorial election campaign. He was an advance man for Nixon&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign.

Following Nixon&#x27;s victory, Ehrlichman became White House Counsel (John Dean would succeed him). Ehrlichman was Counsel for about a year before becoming Chief Domestic Advisor for Nixon. It was then that he became a member of Nixon&#x27;s inner circle. He and close friend H. R. Haldeman, whom he had met at UCLA, were referred to jointly as &quot;The Berlin Wall&quot; by White House staffers because of their German-sounding family names and penchant for isolating Nixon from other advisors and anyone seeking an audience with him. Ehrlichman created &quot;The Plumbers&quot;, the group at the center of the Watergate scandal, and appointed his assistant Egil Krogh to oversee its operations, focusing on stopping leaks of confidential information after the release of the Pentagon Papers in 1971.

Henry Paulson was Ehrlichman&#x27;s assistant in 1972 and 1973.

After the start of the Watergate investigations in 1973, Ehrlichman lobbied for an intentional delay in the confirmation of L. Patrick Gray as Director of the FBI. He argued that the confirmation hearings were deflecting media attention from Watergate and that it would be better for Gray to be left &quot;twisting, slowly, slowly in the wind.&quot;

White House Counsel John Dean cited the &quot;Berlin Wall&quot; of Ehrlichman and Haldeman as one of the reasons for his growing sense of alienation in the White House. This alienation led him to believe he was to become the Watergate scapegoat and to his eventual cooperation with Watergate prosecutors. On April 30, 1973, Nixon fired Dean. Ehrlichman and Haldeman resigned.
===Prison===
Ehrlichman was defended by Andrew C. Hall during the Watergate trials, in which he was convicted of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, perjury, and other charges on January 1, 1975 (along with John N. Mitchell and Haldeman). All three men were initially sentenced to between two and a half and eight years in prison. In 1977, the sentences were commuted to one to four years. Unlike his co-defendants, Ehrlichman voluntarily entered prison before his appeals were exhausted. He was released from the Federal Correctional Institution, Safford, after serving a total of 18 months. Having been convicted of a felony, he was disbarred from the practice of law. Ehrlichman and Haldeman sought and were denied pardons by Nixon, although Nixon later regretted his decision not to grant them. Ehrlichman applied for a pardon from President Reagan in 1987.

==Post-political life==
Following his release from prison, Ehrlichman held a number of jobs, first for a quality control firm, then writer, artist and commentator. Ehrlichman wrote several novels, including &quot;The Company&quot;, which served as the basis for the 1977 television miniseries &quot;&quot;. He served as the executive vice president of an Atlanta hazardous materials firm. In a 1981 interview, Ehrlichman referred to Nixon as a &quot;very pathetic figure in American history.&quot; His experiences in the Nixon administration were published in his 1982 book, &quot;Witness To Power&quot;. The book portrays Nixon in a very negative light, and is considered to be the culmination of his frustration at not being pardoned by Nixon before his own 1974 resignation. Shortly before his death, Ehrlichman teamed with best-selling novelist Tom Clancy to write, produce, and co-host a three-hour Watergate documentary, &quot;John Ehrlichman: In the Eye of the Storm&quot;. The completed but never-broadcast documentary, along with associated papers and videotape elements (including an interview Ehrlichman did with Bob Woodward as part of the project), is housed at the Richard B. Russell Library for Political Research and Studies at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia.

In 1987, Dreyer&#x27;s Grand Ice Cream hired Ehrlichman to do a television commercial for a light ice cream sold by the company, as part of a series of commercials featuring what the company called &quot;unbelievable spokespeople for an unbelievable product.&quot; After complaints from consumers, the company quickly pulled the ad.

Ehrlichman died of complications from diabetes in Atlanta in 1999, after discontinuing dialysis treatments.

==Drug war quote==
In 2016, an alleged quote from Ehrlichman was the lede for an anti-drug war article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; by journalist Dan Baum.

Baum states that Ehrlichman offered this quote in a 1994 interview for Baum&#x27;s 1996 book, &quot;Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure&quot;, but that he did not include it in that book or otherwise publish it for 22 years &quot;because it did not fit the narrative style&quot; of the book.

Multiple family members of Ehrlichman (who died in 1999) challenge the veracity of the quote:
In an expository piece focused on the quote, German Lopez does not address the family&#x27;s assertion that the quote was fabricated by Baum, but suggests that Ehrlichman was either wrong or lying:

==In the media==

John Ehrlichman was portrayed by J. T. Walsh in the film &quot;Nixon&quot;, and by Wayne Péré in &quot;Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House&quot;.

<text>Ivana Ranilović-Vrdoljak (born 1 September 1970 in Koprivnica, Croatia) better known by her stage name Vanna, is a Croatian pop singer.

==Biography==
As a child, Vanna won prizes in various national children and youth festivals. Her debut was at the 1990 Zagrebfest, a music festival held in Zagreb. In that year she left her hometown to live and study in Zagreb and whilst studying, she performed in a band called BOA singing back vocals.

In 1992 her professional career as a singer started when she joined a eurodance band called Electro Team who started to perform as a hip hop and pop rap group and became instant stars. Not only was she a singer but also a co-author and songwriter of all the songs performed by Electro Team. The song &quot;Tek je 12 sati&quot; with which the group turned to a more eurodance sound became a huge hit in 1993, and was popular elsewhere across the former Yugoslavia republics.

In 1997, Vanna left Electro Team to start a solo career and record her first album, &quot;I to sam ja&quot; which brought her own versions of country, blues and jazz standards. As a solo artist she turned to more mature and urban europop and r′n′b with elements of pop rock in some songs. Her first author album &quot;Ispod istog neba&quot; mostly oriented to electronic r′n′b was published in 1998 and won two Porin awards for best female vocal and best vocal cooperation in duet &quot;Ja ću budna sanjati&quot; with singer songwriter Zlatan Stipišić Gibonni . She has since recorded three more solo albums and has won several other awards. She came first at Zadarfest (held in Zadar) three years in succession (1999, 2000 and 2001). Her album &quot;24 sata&quot; which brought more faster europop songs was published in 2000. and reached gold..

In 2000., she came in second in Dora, the Croatian national competition for the Eurovision Song Contest with a song written by Bruno Kovačić and Ivana Plechinger. Being runner-up, she decided to participate again in 2001 and won with &quot;Strune ljubavi&quot;, a song by Tonči Huljić and Vjekoslava Huljić. Shortly after Dora, she gave birth to her daughter Jana. Vanna represented Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 held in Copenhagen on 12th of May 2001 and finished 10th. She sang the song in Croatian and in English, now entitled &quot;Strings of My Heart&quot;.

After Eurovision, Vanna released a live album called &quot;Vanna u Lisinskom&quot; published in 2001 and won Zadarfest again with the song &quot;Više nisi moj&quot;. She won prizes in several other festivals. In 2003, her fourth album &quot;Hrabra kao prije&quot; was published and brought a more organic r′n′b oriented pop sound with more elements of pop rock. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, Vanna took a successful turn to more solid power pop and pop rock music with some acoustic ballads on albums &quot;Ledeno doba&quot; from 2007, and &quot;Sjaj&quot; from 2011, which proved that she can successfully sing any genre not just pop and dance music.

In 2012, she made a guest appearance on the track &quot;Za tvoje oči&quot; from the album &quot;Praštam&quot; of the Serbian rock band Neverne Bebe. After seven years of a discography hiatus, her last studio album &quot;Izmješane boje&quot; was published in 2019 and brought a return to pop, dance and r′n′b music and won a Porin award for pop album of the year. 

Vanna is married to Andrija Vrdoljak, son of Croatian film director Antun Vrdoljak, and they have two children, Luka (born c. 1997.) and Jana (born c. 2001.). The family lives in Zagreb.

<doc id="339394" wikidata="Q2053736" url="?curid=339394" title="Parnassus plays">
<text>The Parnassus plays are three satiric comedies, or full-length academic dramas, each divided into five acts. They date from between 1598 and 1602. They were performed in London by students for an audience of students as part of the Christmas festivities of St John&#x27;s College at Cambridge University. It is not known who wrote them.

The titles of the three plays are
* The Pilgrimage to Parnassus
* The Return from Parnassus
* The Return from Parnassus: Or the Scourge of Simony
The second and third plays are sometimes referred to as Part One and Part Two of &quot;The Return from Parnassus&quot;.

The trilogy raises an Elizabethan question: After college – what comes next? Francis Bacon in his essay &quot;Of Seditions and Troubles&quot; pointed to a 16th-century problem – universities were producing more scholars than there were opportunities for them. The University Wits – Lily, Marlowe, Green, Peele, Nashe and Lodge – were scholars who found employment in theatre, not perhaps their first choice, but there was little else for them. Their great education tended to discourage them from taking up the humble trades of their fathers. The Parnassus plays may not provide a solution, but they at least illustrated the fears of such ambitious young scholastic dreamers.

For the most part, the plays follow the experiences of two students, Philomusus and Studioso. The first play tells the story of two pilgrims on a journey to Parnassus. The plot is an allegory understood to represent the story of two students progressing through the traditional course of education known as the trivium. The accomplishment of their education is represented by Mount Parnassus. The second play drops the allegory and describes the two graduates&#x27; unsuccessful attempts to make a living, as does the third play, which is the only one that was contemporaneously published. New in the third play is the serious treatment of issues regarding censorship.

It has been said that this trilogy of plays &quot;in originality and breadth of execution, and in complex relationship to the academic, literary, theatrical and social life of the period, ranks supreme among the extant memorials of the university stage&quot;, and that they are &quot;among the most inexplicably neglected key documents of Shakespeare&#x27;s age&quot;.

==Overview of the three plays==
The first play, &quot;The Pilgrimage to Parnassus&quot;, describes allegorically the progress of the two students through the university courses of logic, rhetoric, etc., and the temptations that are set before them by their meeting with &quot;Madido&quot;, a drunkard, &quot;Stupido&quot;, a puritan who hates learning, &quot;Amoretto&quot;, a lover, and &quot;Ingenioso&quot;, a disappointed student.

The first play was certainly intended to stand alone, but the favour with which it was received led to the writing of a sequel, &quot;The Return from Parnassus&quot;, which deals with the struggles of the two students after the completion of their studies at the university, and shows them discovering by bitter experience of how little pecuniary value their learning is.

A further sequel, &quot;The Return from Parnassus, Or the Scourge of Simony&quot;, is more ambitious than the two earlier plays. Knowledge of what occurs in the first two plays is not essential to understand the third play, but it is helpful to illuminate a few of the allusions that occur.

The trilogy of the Parnassus plays can be seen as a sustained questioning of the worth of a humanist education, and as a consideration of the employment crisis that faced graduates at the end of the Elizabethan period. The plays are lively and amusing, and contain a sense of taking stock of the writer&#x27;s place in society at the turn of the century. They are neglected by academic scholarship, and not greatly appreciated as plays in their own right, but they are known as a source for references to Shakespeare and Jonson, and for other allusions they contain.

An old farmer, Consiliodorus, gives advice to his son, Philomusus, and his nephew, Studioso, as the two young men are about to begin their journey to Parnassus. He advises them not to consort with wastrels and to eschew alcohol and sex, which will distract them. The first place the two young men travel through is the mountainous land of Logique on their way to the island of Dialectica, where they meet a poet, Madido. Madido doesn&#x27;t believe in Parnassus and thinks inspiration is only to be found in drink. Madido urges them not to bother with their journey, but to stay and drink with him. They decline and continue on.

Next, in the land of Rhetorique, Philomusus and Studioso overtake a character named Stupido, who set out on the same pilgrimage ten years ago, but has given up and now follows trivial pursuits. He disguises his lack of talent with a pose of not appreciating scholarship.

Philomusus and Studioso then encounter the lover, Amaretto, who encourages them to leave their pilgrimage, and instead linger in the land of Poetry and dally with wenches. This time Philomusus and Studioso are persuaded and abandon, at least for a while, the path to Parnassus.

Before it&#x27;s too late, Philomusus and Studioso have come to their senses, have decided to leave the amorous land of poetry. They continue on, and meet a character who is former student, Ingenioso. He tries to discourage Philomusus and Studioso from their pilgrimage by telling them that there is nothing but poverty on Mount Parnassus. Dromo enters drawing on a clown by a rope, because he feels that every play needs a clown. They finally arrive at the foothills of Mount Parnassus, and take a moment to gaze up at it in a spirit of celebration. Studioso invites the audience to applaud.

Consiliodorus, father to Philomusus and uncle to Studioso is meeting with a messenger, Leonarde, who will deliver a letter to Philomusus and Studioso. He sent those two young men to on a journey seven years ago, and now expects results. Consiliodorus exits as Philomusus and Studioso enter, both bemoaning that since leaving Parnassus fate hasn&#x27;t been kind, and the world is not a fruitful place for scholars. They meet a former student, Ingenioso, who tells them he has been living by the printing house and selling pamphlets. Now he is pursuing the support of a patron. The patron appears, and Ingenioso offers him immortality through his verse. Ingenioso then offers the patron a pamphlet that is dedicated to him. The patron glances at it, gives Ingenioso two small coins, and exits. Ingenioso, alone, is furious with the patron&#x27;s miserliness. Philomusus and Studioso reenter to hear how it went. Ingenioso now plans to go to London and live by the printers trade. Philomusus and Studioso decide to go along, and include Luxuioso, who has also left Parnassus to go to London. The four, now former students, take a moment to bid farewell to Parnassus.

The Draper and the Tayler, local businessmen both complain that they trusted Philomusus and Studioso, did some draping and tailoring, and Philomusus and Studioso ran away owing them money. The tapsters has a similar problem with another former student, Luxuioso. Philomusus and Studioso meet up, both complain of the lowly jobs they have taken, Philomusus is a sexton/gravedigger, and Studioso is a household servant, farmhand, waiter and tutor. Percevall enters with a grave-digging job for Philomusus. Percevall wants Philomusus to quickly dig a grave for his father, who may not be dead yet, but will be very soon. He also wants Philomusus to write out the soon-to-be-dead father&#x27;s will so that Percevall will inherit his fortune. Next Studioso enters with the boy he is tutoring, and attempts to give a lesson in Latin grammar. Then Luxurio and a boy enter, on the way to a fair. Luxurio has written some poems and plans to sell them at the fair by having the boy recite them. They give a demonstration.

Ingenioso has found a kind of patron in Gullio, a character that is partly based on Thomas Nashe&#x27;s portrait of &quot;an upstart&quot; in his pamphlet &quot;Pierce Penniless&quot;. Gullio &quot;maintains&quot; Ingenioso very neglectfully. Foppishly dressed Gullio falsely boasts of being a valiant, noble and romantic character. Ingenioso offers himself as a poet to memorialize Gullio in sonnets. Gullio then persuades Ingenioso to impersonate his mistress, Lesbia, while Gullio rehearses love poetry that Gullio himself has written and derived from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;. Gullio plans to eventually recite these verses as part of his wooing of Lesbia. In the next scene, Consiliodorus, father to Philomusus, uncle to Studioso, who funded their journey to Parnassus meets with the carrier and horse-back messenger Leonarde. Leonarde reports that he scolded Philomusus and Studioso and reminded them that their nurturing was costly. Leonarde thinks they may have found jobs as clerks. Consiliodorus is disappointed they are not doing as well as they should be doing.

Ingenioso composes amorous verses in the styles of Chaucer, Spenser, and William Shakespeare, the last alone being to the patron&#x27;s satisfaction. Gullio, a great admirer of &quot;sweet Mr. Shakespeare&quot;, says he will obtain a picture of him for his study and will &quot;worship sweet Mr Shakespeare and to honour him will lay his Venus and Adonis under my pillow, as we read of one – I do not well remember his name, but I&#x27;m sure he was a king – slept with Homer under his bed&#x27;s head&quot;. Percevall enters. He has a new position as the church warden and is now referred to as Mr. Warden. He&#x27;s looking for the Sexton, who is Philomusus. Philomusus hasn&#x27;t been doing a good job as Sexton, and Perceval informs him he is no longer the Sexton. Studioso then enters, he has also lost his position, which was to be tutor to a young boy and perform other household tasks. These two protagonists have reached a depth of hopeless misery ill-equipped for a world that does not appreciate scholars. At least they have each other, as they dejectedly agree to go wandering off in poverty together.

Ingenioso&#x27;s foolish patron, Gullio, had asked Ingenioso to write and deliver poetic messages to a young woman. This goes badly, Gullio blames Ingenioso, and yet another former scholar, Ingenioso, loses his position. Rather than go wandering off like Studioso and Philomusus, Ingenioso resorts, once again, to pamphleteering for the popular press.

Luxurio appears along with the boy. Luxurio&#x27;s attempt to sell his poems has not been fruitful, and he is now broke. He bids farewell to poetry. He intends to go away, drink the world dry, as he accepts his status as a beggar.

Before the play begins, Studioso and Philomusus travelled to Rome with the expectation of becoming rich, but they discovered that expatriate Englishmen don&#x27;t live as well as they had hoped. They then travelled around, and tried various honest jobs, but now they have run out of such opportunities, and must therefore turn to dishonest work. They establish a medical practice in London, with Philomusus masquerading as a fashionable French doctor, but they end that charade in time to avoid arrest.

Ingenioso has now become a satirist. On the excuse of discussing a recently published collection of extracts from contemporary poetry, John Bodenham&#x27;s &quot;Belvedere&quot;, he briefly criticises a number of writers of the day, including Edmund Spenser, Henry Constable, Michael Drayton, John Davies, John Marston, Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson, Shakespeare, and Thomas Nashe; the last of whom is referred to as dead. Ingenioso attempts to sell a book to a printer named Danter. Ingenioso&#x27;s last book lost money, but his new one is more promising, it&#x27;s about cuckolds in Cambridge.

Needing employment, Academico finds his old friend from college, Amaretto, whose father, Sir Raderick, has a position as a parson to offer. But Amoretto has just accepted a bribe to give it to Immerito. Amoretto pretends not to recognize Academico, and gets rid of him by an off-putting and lengthy discourse regarding technicalities of hunting. Immerito is examined by Sir Radeerick and the Recorder, who find him educated and pliable enough for the job. This practice of selling church positions is &quot;simony&quot;, which is referred to in the subtitle of this play.

Sir Raderick is worried about certain libels written about his family, which are going around in London. They are being written in verse by Furor Poeticus at the encouragement of Ingenioso. A confrontation occurs between the poets and sir Raderick, after he has taken possession of Prodigo&#x27;s forfeited land.

Studioso and Philomusus attempt other jobs. They apply to Richard Burbage&#x27;s theatre hoping to becoming actors, but they realize that actors don&#x27;t get paid enough. They are engaged by a company of fiddlers, but their first performance is at the front door of Sir Raderick&#x27;s house. The pages of Sir Raderick and Amoretto pretend to be their masters, and dismiss the fiddlers without payment. At last, Studioso and Philomusus decide to work as shepherds in Kent, while Ingenioso and Furor have to escape to the Isle of Dogs. Academico goes back to Cambridge.

==Authorship==
It is not known who wrote them or if they were all the work of one person. John Day was suggested as a possible author by Bolton Corney in 1868, based on a copy of the 1606 quarto, on which was hand-written, &quot;To my Lovinge Smallocke J: D:&quot;, and also based on Corney&#x27;s comparison of the handwriting, and on personal connections that Day had as a Cambridge man. But the suggestion has had little support. Some clues to the author&#x27;s identity are offered in the prologue to the second play, &quot;The Return from Parnassus&quot;, but they are not enough to make an identification. Whoever the author was, the plays indicate that he was intelligent, observant and well read. The author appears to have included a self-portrait in the guise of the character &quot;Judicio&quot;, who appears in third play and comments on a number of contemporary poets.

==Dating==
The three pieces were evidently performed at Christmas of different years, not later than Christmas 1602, because of the references to Queen Elizabeth I, who died in March 1603. The first play, &quot;Pilgrimage to Parnassus&quot; can not have been written earlier than 1598, because it mentions books that were not printed until that year. The prologue of the third play, &quot;The Return from Parnassus: Or the Scourge of Simony&quot;, states that that play had been written for the preceding year, so the year 1601 seems credible for the writing of the last play of the trilogy.

==Shakespeare in the text of the Parnassus plays==

William Shakespeare is alluded to often, and his works are quoted by one count at least 95 times in the three Parnassus plays. He is explicitly mentioned by name in the last two plays. At almost every turn he is satirized or mocked, which is to be expected in a satire, and also when the target of the satire has become very successful and well known.

The Parnassus plays are seen, at least in part, as extending the war of words that had been occurring between the university men and those who were not part of that group. The university men would include Cambridge alumni Thomas Nashe and Robert Greene, who both had attacked Shakespeare in print: Nashe in his pamphlet, &quot;Pierce Penniless&quot;, and Greene in &quot;Greene&#x27;s Groats-Worth of Wit&quot;. Shakespeare had replied in turn with some mockery of Nashe in his play &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;.

Shakespeare and his theatre company were on tour probably in 1601 and visited Oxford and Cambridge, sometime between the performances of parts two and three of the trilogy. This is indicated on the title-page of the first quarto of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1603), where the play is said to have been acted &quot;in the two Universities.&quot;

Just such a troupe of low-born actors is described in &quot;The Return to Parnassus; the Scourge of Simony&quot;, as they might be seen from the point-of-view of competitive and envious young scholars:
&lt;poem&gt;England affords those glorious vagabonds
That carried earst their fardels on their backes,
Coursers to ride on through the gazing streetes,
Sooping it in their glaring Satten sutes,
And Pages to attend their Maisterships:
With mouthing words that better wits have framed,
They purchase lands, and now Esquiers are namde.&lt;/poem&gt;

A tone of bitter mockery is established as Philomusus and Studiosus, out of desperation, audition for the professional stage, and are judged by Richard Burbage and Will Kemp, two important members of Shakespeare&#x27;s company, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, who find humor in the deficiencies of scholars not only as actors but also as dramatists:

&lt;poem&gt;KEMPE: The slaves are somewhat proud, and besides it is a good sport in a part to see them never speak in their walk, but at the end of the stage, just as though in walking with a fellow we should never speak but at a stile, a gate, or a ditch, where a man can go no further….

BURBAGE: A little teaching will mend these faults, and it may be besides they will be able to pen a part.

KEMPE: Few of the University [men] plaies well, they smell too much of that writer Ovid, and that writer Metamorphosis, and talk too much of Proserpina and Jupiter. Why heres our fellow Shakespeare puts them all downe, I and Ben Jonson too. O that Ben Jonson is a pestilent fellow, he brought up Horace giving the poets a pill, but our fellow Shakespeare hath given him a purge that made him bewray his credit.&lt;/poem&gt;

This well-known passage is bitterly ironic: The author of the Parnassus plays is holding up to scorn – for an academic audience – the opinions of two illiterate fools, Burbage and Kempe, who think that Metamorphosis is a writer, and that their colleague, Shakespeare, puts the university playwrights to shame.

The audition piece Philomusus is asked to perform is taken from the opening monologue of Shakespeare&#x27;s play, &quot;Richard III&quot;: &quot;Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this son of York.&quot; In this part of the trilogy, Shakespeare is seen as a poet, and also as a dramatist and actor.

In the second play, &quot;The Return from Parnasus&quot;, the character named Gullio, who is lovesick and a fool, is mocked for his worshipful devotion to &quot;pure Shakspeare and shreds of poetry that he hath gathered at the theaters.&quot; When Gullio later cries out, &quot;O sweet Mr. Shakspeare! I&#x27;ll have his picture in my study at the court,&quot; it suggests that young scholars who appreciated Shakespeare&#x27;s writing, also had a regard for his person.

The author of the Parnassus plays has the character Judico comment on a number of poets, and he considers Shakespeare:
&lt;poem&gt;Who loves not Adons love, or Lucrece rape?
His sweeter verse contaynes hart throbbing line,
Could but a graver subject him content
Without loves foolish lazy languishment.&lt;/poem&gt;

Apparently he admires the language and verse in Shakespeare&#x27;s early poems, but suggests that Shakespeare may have been wasting his talent by writing love poetry. This faint praise of Shakespeare the actor-poet contrasts with the greater praise he gives to Drayton, Nashe and others.

==Identifying allusions==
The question of whether or not the characters are meant to represent actual persons, and if so to what extent, has been much discussed. Much of the speculation centering around the London literary scene. However, sustained reference to the London scene, is not a part of the first play, but enters into the trilogy only for the second and third parts. It is thought that by the time the final part was written the author may have more or less identified Ingenioso with Nashe, though the character was not originally conceived with this intention. Ingenioso does speak in praise of Nashe, who died in 1601. The author of the plays was evidently very familiar with Nashe&#x27;s works, and all three parts are full of reminiscences of Nashe&#x27;s writings. In the third play Ingenioso announces that he is in trouble for the plays he has written, and he exits saying, &quot;now I am bound for the Ile of doggs … Fare well.&quot; A notorious dramatic satire titled &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot;, written by Nashe and Ben Jonson, and performed in 1597, was considered so slanderous that the Privy Council gave in to pressure from the City government and demanded theatrical performances be stopped and that London&#x27;s playhouses be torn down.

It is thought that the two students, Studioso and Philomusus are in part portrayals of Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd. Of course Shakespeare never attended university, but for the students there might be some satiric pleasure in imagining such a character attempting Cambridge, meeting failure, and in the end being forced to return to the country life from whence he came, as occurs in the plays.

It is thought that &quot;Furor Poeticus&quot; represents John Marston, and &quot;Luxurio&quot; represents Gabriel Harvey.

The courtier Gullio is not only a character in the play but is used to satirize Shakespeare&#x27;s patron the Earl of Southampton, who also attended St. John&#x27;s. Southampton would not have attended the performance in 1601, he was at the time under sentence of death for his part in the Essex conspiracy.

The printer Danter, who appears in the third play, is based on actual person, a printer named John Danter, who is noted for printing the piratical first quarto of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, as well as other plays and texts.

The college recorder, Francis Brackyn was an actual person, who is harshly satirized in &quot;The Return from Parnassus: Or the Scourge of Simony&quot; as the character &quot;Recorder&quot;. Brackyn had been ridiculed in another university play, &quot;Club Rules&quot;, and would be yet again as the title character in George Ruggle&#x27;s 1615 academic play &quot;Ignoramus&quot;.

==Printing history==
The third play, &quot;The Return from Parnassus; the Scourge of Simony&quot;, was licensed and entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register in 1605 by Owen Gwyn:

It was then published twice in 1606 – four years after its original performance – with many textual variations between the two editions. It was reprinted in the 18th century, and again in 1879. The third play was the only part that was published, and for many years the first two plays were considered lost. Then in 1886 W. D. Macray, the librarian of the Bodleian Library at Oxford, discovered the lost plays, while he was doing research among the manuscripts collected by Thomas Hearne, which are part of the Richard Rawlinson collection at the Bodleian Library. Macray immediately edited and published all three plays together.

The handwritten manuscripts of the first two plays consist of twenty folio leaves, and were written imperfectly by a copyist who may have had trouble at times reading his original.

A handwritten manuscript of the third play, &quot;The Return from Parnassus, or the Scourge of Simony&quot;, also exists. It was found in an old family library, according to Macray. The handwriting indicates that it is contemporary with the play&#x27;s first performances. It is a small quarto volume, bound in parchment. The manuscript is housed in the Folger Shakespeare Library.

Study of the handwritten manuscript of the third play, owned by James Halliwell-Phillipps, has helped to correct a number of errors that exist in the early printed editions.

==A reading==
A rehearsed reading of the &quot;Return from Parnassus, or The Scourge of Simony&quot; was performed 6 December 2009 as part of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre&#x27;s Read Not Dead series. The cast included David Oakes as Ingenious and Kevin Quarmby as Burbage.

<text>Weevils are beetles belonging to the superfamily Curculionoidea, known for their elongated snouts. They are usually small – less than in length – and herbivorous. Approximately 97,000 species of weevils are known. They belong to several families, with most of them in the family Curculionidae (the true weevils). It also includes bark beetles, which while morphologically dissimilar to other weevils in lacking the distinctive snout, is a subfamily of Curculionidae. Some other beetles, although not closely related, bear the name &quot;weevil&quot;, such as the leaf beetle subfamily Bruchinae, known as &quot;bean weevils&quot;, or the biscuit weevil (&quot;Stegobium paniceum&quot;), which belongs to the family Ptinidae.

Many weevils are considered pests because of their ability to damage and kill crops. The grain or wheat weevil (&quot;Sitophilus granarius&quot;) damages stored grain, as does the maize weevil (&quot;Sitophilus zeamais&quot;), among others. The boll weevil (&quot;Anthonomus grandis&quot;) attacks cotton crops; it lays its eggs inside cotton bolls and the larvae eat their way out. Other weevils are used for biological control of invasive plants.

A weevil&#x27;s rostrum, or elongated snout, hosts chewing mouthparts instead of the piercing mouthparts that proboscis-possessing insects are known for. The mouthparts are often used to excavate tunnels into grains. In more derived weevils, the rostrum has a groove in which the weevil can fold the first segment of its antennae.

Most weevils have the ability to fly (including pest species such as the rice weevil), though a significant number are flightless, such as the genus &quot;Otiorhynchus&quot;, and others can jump.

One species of weevil, &quot;Austroplatypus incompertus&quot;, exhibits eusociality, one of the few insects outside the Hymenoptera and the Isoptera to do so.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
Because so many species exist in such diversity, the higher classification of weevils is in a state of flux. They are generally divided into two major divisions, the Orthoceri or primitive weevils, and the Gonatoceri or true weevils (Curculionidae). E. C. Zimmerman proposed a third division, the Heteromorphi, for several intermediate forms. Primitive weevils are distinguished by having straight antennae, while true weevils have elbowed (geniculate) antennae. The elbow occurs at the end of the scape (first antennal segment) in true weevils, and the scape is usually much longer than the other antennal segments. Some exceptions occur, such as Nanophyini, primitive weevils with long scapes and geniculate antennae, while among the true weevils, Gonipterinae and &quot;Ramphus&quot; have short scapes and little or no &quot;elbow&quot;.

A 1995 classification system to family level was provided by Kuschel, with updates from Marvaldi &quot;et al.&quot; in 2002, and was achieved using phylogenetic analyses. The accepted families were the primitive weevils, Anthribidae, Attelabidae, Belidae, Brentidae, Caridae, and Nemonychidae, and the true weevils Curculionidae. Most other weevil families were demoted to subfamilies or tribes. Further work resulted in the elevation of Cimberididae to family from placement as a subfamily of Nemonychidae in 2017 and the recognition of the Cretaceous age family Mesophyletidae in 2018 from Burmese amber. The oldest weevils date to the Middle-Late Jurassic boundary, found in the Karabastau Formation of Kazakhstan, the Shar-Teg locality of Mongolia, the Daohugou locality in Inner Mongolia, China, and the Talbragar site in Australia. The extinct family Obrieniidae, with species dating from the Ladinian stage of the Triassic through to tentatively the Oxfordian, have sometimes been considered weevils. Genera of the family have only been found in three formations in Kazakhstan, with most named in 1993. However, their phylogenetic position is contested, with others considering it part of Archostemata.

The interfamilial relationships of Curculionoidea have been generally well resolved. The phylogeny by Li et al. (2023) based on phylogenomic data is suggested below:
==Families==
* Anthribidae—fungus weevils
* Attelabidae—leaf rolling weevils
* Belidae—primitive weevils
* Brentidae—straight snout weevils
* Caridae
* Cimberididae
* Curculionidae—true weevils
* Mesophyletidae
* Nemonychidae—pine flower weevils
* ?Obrieniidae

== Sexual dimorphism ==
&quot;Rhopalapion longirostre&quot; exhibits an extreme case of sexual dimorphism. The female rostrum is twice as long and its surface is smoother than in the male. The female bores egg channels into the buds of &quot;Alcea rosea&quot;. Thus, the dimorphism is not attributed to sexual selection. It is a response to ecological demands of egg deposition.

Another example of extreme dimorphism in weevils is that of the New Zealand giraffe weevil. Males measure up to and females , although there is an extreme range of body sizes in both sexes.

<text>The Omega Man (stylized as The Ωmega Man) is a 1971 American postapocalyptic action film directed by Boris Sagal and starring Charlton Heston as a survivor of a pandemic. It was written by John William Corrington and Joyce Corrington, based on the 1954 novel &quot;I Am Legend&quot; by Richard Matheson. The film&#x27;s producer, Walter Seltzer, went on to work with Heston again in the dystopian science-fiction film &quot;Soylent Green&quot; in 1973.

&quot;The Omega Man&quot; is the second adaptation of Matheson&#x27;s novel. The first was &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot; (1964), which starred Vincent Price. A third adaptation, &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, starring Will Smith, was released in 2007, and appropriated this film&#x27;s tagline.

== Plot ==
In March 1975, a Sino-Soviet border conflict escalates into full-scale war in which biological warfare destroys most of the human race. U.S. Army Col. Robert Neville, M.D., is a scientist based in Los Angeles. As he begins to succumb to the plague, he injects himself with an experimental vaccine, rendering him immune.

By August 1977, Neville believes he is the plague&#x27;s only immune survivor. Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the now-desolate Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of &quot;the Family&quot;, a cult of plague victims who were turned into homicidal nocturnal albino mutants. Through flashbacks, Neville remembers how martial law was imposed and the majority of people who succumbed to the plague were killed instantly by asphyxiation. At night, living atop a fortified apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in his own home. He is besieged by the Family, who seeks to kill him. The Family&#x27;s attempts to extract Neville from his residence have failed, due in part to their insistence on using archaic weaponry and siege warfare. When not hunting Neville, the Family destroys any remnant of science, blaming technology for the war, hence their reluctance to attempt more modern means to kill Neville.

One day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a healthy woman, who immediately flees. He pursues her outside, but later chalks it up to imagination, having earlier hallucinated about multiple telephones ringing. He finds the corpse of a Family member and remarks that the final stage of the disease will kill them all.

On another day, the Family finally captures Neville. After a summary trial, he is found guilty of heresy by the Family&#x27;s leader, Jonathan Matthias, a former news anchorman. Neville is sentenced to death and nearly burned at the stake tied to a large wooden wheel representing modern technology in Dodger Stadium. He is rescued by Lisa, the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and Dutch, a former medical student. Lisa and Dutch are part of a group of survivors, none of whom exceed the age of 30. Although their youth has given them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it, and will eventually succumb to mutation. Neville realizes salvaging humanity would take years as he will need a long time to duplicate the original vaccine. He believes extending his immunity to others may be possible by creating a serum from his own blood.
Neville and Lisa return to Neville&#x27;s apartment, where they begin treating Lisa&#x27;s brother Richie, who is succumbing to the disease. Neville and Lisa are about to have a romantic evening together, just as the generator runs out of fuel and the lights go off. The Family then attacks, sending Matthias&#x27; second-in-command, Brother Zachary, to climb up the outside of Neville&#x27;s building to the open balcony of his apartment. Neville leaves Lisa upstairs as he goes to the basement garage to restart the generator. Neville returns to the apartment to find Zachary right behind an unsuspecting Lisa. Neville shoots him and he falls off the balcony to his death, dropping his spear on the balcony as he goes.

If the serum works, Neville and Lisa plan to leave the ravaged city with the rest of the survivors, and start new lives in the wilderness, leaving the Family behind to die. Neville is successful in creating the serum and administers it to Richie. Once cured, Richie reveals the Family&#x27;s headquarters to Neville (the Los Angeles Civic Center), but insists that the Family is also human and that Neville&#x27;s cure should be administered to them, as well. Neville disagrees with him, so Richie goes to the Family by himself to try to convince them to take the serum. Matthias refuses to believe that Neville would try to help them, accuses Richie of being sent to spy on them, and has him executed. After finding a note that Richie left, Neville rushes to rescue him, but instead finds his dead body tied to a judge&#x27;s chair in a courtroom.

Meanwhile, Lisa quickly and unexpectedly succumbs to the disease and becomes one of the Family. Returning home, Neville tells Lisa about Richie&#x27;s death, but she already knows and has betrayed Neville by giving Matthias and his followers access to Neville&#x27;s home. Matthias, who finally has the upper hand, forces Neville to watch as the Family sets his home and equipment on fire. Neville breaks free, and once outside with Lisa, he turns and raises his gun to shoot Matthias, who is looking down from the balcony. The gun jams, giving Matthias enough time to hurl Zachary&#x27;s spear at Neville, mortally wounding him. The next morning, Dutch and the survivors discover Neville dying in a fountain. He hands Dutch a flask of the blood serum, and then dies. Dutch takes Lisa (weakened and compliant because of the sunlight) away, and the survivors leave the city forever.

==Cast==
* Charlton Heston as Robert Neville
* Anthony Zerbe as Jonathan Matthias
* Rosalind Cash as Lisa
* Paul Koslo as Dutch
* Eric Laneuville as Richie
* Lincoln Kilpatrick as Zachary
* Brian Tochi as Tommy

==Production==
The film differs from the novel (and the previous film) in several ways. In the novel, humanity is destroyed by a bacterial plague spread by bats and mosquitoes, which turns the population into vampire-like creatures; whereas, in this film version, biological warfare is the cause of the plague that kills most of the population by asphyxiation and turns most of the rest into nocturnal albino mutants. Screenwriter Joyce Corrington holds a doctorate in chemistry and felt that this was more suitable for an adaptation.

In Charlton Heston&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;In the Arena: An Autobiography&quot;, he mentioned that the &quot;crucifixion&quot; scene with Neville was not in the original script. As it turns out, the scene was felt to fit quite well into the storyline, so was left in.

Exterior filming took place throughout the Los Angeles area. Neville&#x27;s house is still on the backlot of the Warner Bros. Ranch. As part of the plot, the filmmakers needed to create a depopulated metropolis. Without CGI, this was accomplished by filming on Sunday mornings in the center of the Los Angeles&#x27; business district, which in late 1970 was quiet on early weekend mornings. Despite careful planning by the film crew, some exterior shots captured bystanders and moving cars in the background of some scenes.

===Interracial kiss===
Whoopi Goldberg (mistakenly) remarked that the kiss between the characters played by Charlton Heston and Rosalind Cash was one of the first interracial kisses to appear in a movie (in actual fact, several movies had shown interracial kissing long before this, with 1957&#x27;s &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; often quoted as being the first mainstream Hollywood movie to do so). In 1992, when Goldberg had her own network interview talk show, she invited Heston to be a guest, and asked him about the kiss. After discussing whether Heston received any flak for the kiss at the time, Goldberg said that she wished that society could get past interracial relationships being an issue, at which point Heston leaned forward and demonstrated on the unsuspecting Goldberg, to her delight.

Screenwriter Joyce H. Corrington stated that in developing the script for &quot;The Omega Man,&quot; the character of Lisa, played by Rosalind Cash, was created due to the rise of the Black Power movement, which was particularly prominent in American culture at the time the film was made. She goes on to remark that this created an effective and interesting dynamic between the characters of Lisa and Neville.

Heston wrote in his autobiography that &quot;The Omega Man&quot; was Cash&#x27;s first leading role in a film, and that she was understandably &quot;a little edgy&quot; about doing a love scene with him. Heston explained, &quot;It was in the seventies that I realized a generation of actors had grown up who saw me in terms of the iconic roles they remembered from their childhoods. &#x27;It&#x27;s a spooky feeling,&#x27; she told me, &#x27;to screw Moses.&#x27;&quot;

===Deleted scene===

The script for &quot;The Omega Man&quot; contains a scene in which Lisa visits her parents&#x27; grave. Unknown to Neville, Lisa is pregnant, and she seeks comfort from her deceased parents before Neville and she leave the city forever. While Lisa is talking to her parents&#x27; grave, she hears a sound and investigates a crypt. In it, she spots a female Family member depositing a dead newborn mutant. Lisa can see the mother&#x27;s grief and empathizes with the woman&#x27;s loss, despite their being on different sides. Lisa believes that all children, including her unborn baby, will suffer the same fate. Later, Lisa returns to Neville and tells him of the woman in the crypt. Neville asks Lisa if she &quot;took care&quot; of things and Lisa responds that since she may be a grieving parent in a few months, she will not kill a grief-stricken mother. Neville is shocked at first, but then embraces Lisa. While the scene was cut from the final film, the screen credit for &quot;Woman in Cemetery Crypt&quot; remains.

==Release==
The film opened at three theaters in Houston in July 1971.

== Reception ==
At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Omega Man&quot; received mixed reviews, with a combined average positive score of 65% from 34 critics.

Howard Thompson gave a mostly negative review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saying, &quot;the climax is as florid and phony as it can be,&quot; while A.D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;an extremely literate science-fiction drama.&quot; Roger Ebert awarded two stars out of four and found the mutants &quot;a little too ridiculous to quite fulfill their function in the movie.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film one star out of four, writing that director Boris Sagal &quot;must have resembled a juggler trying to keep four dramatic balls aloft. About midway through the film, the balls started bumping into each other, Sagal began to stumble, and by the time the crew was completing the final scene, Sagal was on the floor with the balls bouncing wildly away from his grasp.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;strictly a potboiler, but it&#x27;s without pretensions and never runs dry. Director Boris Sagal has captured some stark apocalyptic images and gotten some suitably vivid performances. Most importantly, he keeps things moving so fast that there&#x27;s not enough time to ponder credibility gaps big enough to fly a Boeing 747 through.&quot; Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Director Sagal displays no great affinity for science fiction — he&#x27;s from TV land — but he generally upholds interest and can certainly handle the shocks and suspense, which are both abundant and enjoyable in a Saturday matinee way.&quot;

Director Tim Burton said in an interview for his 2009 Museum of Modern Art exhibit, &quot;If I was alone on a desert island, I&#x27;d probably pick something that I could relate to—probably &quot;The Omega Man&quot; with Charlton Heston. I don&#x27;t know why that is one of my favorite movies, but it is.&quot; In another interview, with the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Burton remarked that no matter how many times he has seen it, if it is on television, he will stop to watch it. He said that when he originally saw &quot;The Omega Man&quot;, it was the first instance that he recalls seeing the use of certain types of &quot;cheesy one-liners&quot; in film. The film is full of irony-tinged one-liners that are spoken in a manner to elicit a comic response. Burton compares these to the famous one-liners in Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s film career, such as &quot;I&#x27;ll be back.&quot;

As with &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot;, &quot;The Omega Man&quot; was not to Richard Matheson&#x27;s liking, though it did not provoke much of a reaction from the author, either. &quot;&quot;The Omega Man&quot; was so removed from my book that it didn’t even bother me,&quot; Matheson said.

===Box office===
The film grossed $29,900 in its first week. It went on to earn $4 million in theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada.

== In popular culture ==
* The first short in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ &quot;Treehouse of Horror VIII&quot; (1997) special, &quot;The HΩmega Man&quot;, is an homage to the film, with its basic story happening in Springfield.
* Famous Paraguayan-Argentine comic-book writer Robin Wood and Argentine artist Ricardo Villagrán created the 1970s classic Argentine &quot;historieta&quot; (comic) &quot;Mark&quot; strictly based on &quot;The Omega Man&quot;&#x27;s postapocalyptic world. The eponymous hero and protagonist, Mark, is also based on Neville&#x27;s character concept of a man of action.
* Bob McKenzie, in the beginning of the film &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, states, &quot;I was kind of like a one-man force like Charlton Heston in &quot;Omega Man&quot;. Did you see it? It was beauty.&quot;
* The 1981 album &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; by The Police features a track &quot;Omegaman&quot; (also stylised as &quot;Ωmegaman&quot;) written by Andy Summers, based on the film.
* The music video for The Human League&#x27;s 1984 single &quot;Life on Your Own&quot; was based on the film.
* The scene in which Heston&#x27;s character watches &quot;Woodstock&quot; inspired Joel Hodgson to create &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

<text>Charles Joseph Parrott (October 20, 1893 – June 20, 1940), known professionally as Charley Chase, was an American comedian, actor, screenwriter and film director. He worked for many pioneering comedy studios but is chiefly associated with producer Hal Roach. Chase was the elder brother of comedian/director James Parrott.

==Life and career==
Born Charles Joseph Parrott in Baltimore, Maryland, Charley Chase began performing in vaudeville as a teenager and started his career in films by working at the Christie Film Company in 1912. He then moved to Keystone Studios, where he began appearing in bit parts in the Mack Sennett films, including those of Charlie Chaplin. By 1915 he was playing juvenile leads in the Keystones, and directing some of the films as Charles Parrott. His Keystone credentials were good enough to get him steady work as a comedy director with other companies; he directed many of Chaplin imitator Billy West&#x27;s comedies, which featured a young Oliver Hardy as a villain.
He worked at Henry Lehrman&#x27;s L-KO Kompany during its final months of existence. Then in 1920, Chase began working as a film director for the Hal Roach studio. Among his notable early work for Roach was supervising the first entries in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series. Chase became director-general of the Hal Roach studio in late 1921, supervising the production of all the Roach series except the Harold Lloyd comedies. Following Lloyd&#x27;s departure from the studio in 1923, Chase moved back in front of the camera with his own series of shorts, adopting the screen name Charley Chase.

Chase was a master of the comedy of embarrassment, and he played either hapless young businessmen or befuddled husbands in dozens of situation comedies. His screen persona was that of a pleasant young man with a dapper mustache and ordinary street clothes; this set him apart from the clownish makeup and crazy costumes used by his contemporaries. His earliest Roach shorts cast him as a hard-luck fellow named &quot;Jimmie Jump&quot; in one-reel (10-minute) comedies.
The first Chase series was successful and expanded to two reels (20 minutes); this would become the standard length for Chase comedies, apart from a few three-reel featurettes later. The direction of the Chase series was taken over by Leo McCarey, who, in collaboration with Chase formed the comic style of the series: characterization and farce instead of knockabout slapstick. Some of Chase&#x27;s starring shorts of the 1920s, particularly &quot;Mighty Like a Moose&quot;, &quot;Crazy Like a Fox&quot;, &quot;Fluttering Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Limousine Love&quot;, are often considered to be among the finest in silent comedy. Chase remained the guiding hand behind the films, assisting anonymously with the directing, writing, and editing.

Chase moved with ease into sound films in 1929 and became one of the most popular film comedians of the period. He continued to be very prolific in the talkie era, often putting his fine singing voice on display and including his humorous, self-penned songs in his comedy shorts. The two-reeler &quot;The Pip from Pittsburg&quot;, released in 1931 and co-starring Thelma Todd, is one of the most celebrated Charley Chase comedies of the sound era. Throughout the decade, the &quot;Charley Chase&quot; shorts continued to stand alongside Laurel and Hardy and Our Gang as the core output of the Roach studio. Chase was featured in the Laurel and Hardy feature &quot;Sons of the Desert&quot;; Laurel and Hardy made cameo appearances as hitchhikers in Chase&#x27;s &quot;On the Wrong Trek&quot;.

&quot;On the Wrong Trek&quot; was supposed to be the final Charley Chase short subject: by 1936 producer Hal Roach was now concentrating on making ambitious feature films. Chase played a character role in the Patsy Kelly feature &quot;Kelly the Second&quot;, and starred in a 55-minute feature, &quot;Bank Night&quot;, lampooning the popular Bank Night phenomenon of the 1930s. Chase&#x27;s feature was plagued with a host of production problems and legalities, and the film was drastically edited down to two reels and finally released as one last Charley Chase short, &quot;Neighborhood House&quot;. The 55-minute version included a subplot, in which gangsters raid the theater and hold Chase captive; this footage was removed. Featured players Margaret Irving, George Chandler, Charles Lane, and Tom Dugan were cast in the feature, but they do not appear in the revised short-subject version. Chase was then dismissed from the Roach studio.

==Later years and death==
In 1937, Chase began working at Columbia Pictures, where he spent the rest of his career starring in his own series of two-reel comedies, as well as producing and directing other Columbia comedies, including those of The Three Stooges, Andy Clyde, Smith and Dale, Walter Catlett, and Herman Bing. He directed the Stooges&#x27; classic &quot;Violent is the Word for Curly&quot; (1938). He is often credited with writing the film&#x27;s song &quot;Swinging the Alphabet&quot;, However, the tune actually originates with 19th-century songwriter Septimus Winner. Recent research asserts that the Chase family&#x27;s maid introduced the song to Chase and taught it to his daughters. Chase&#x27;s own shorts at Columbia favored broader sight gags and more slapstick than his earlier, subtler work, although he does sing in two of the Columbias, &quot;The Grand Hooter&quot; and &quot;The Big Squirt&quot; (both 1937). 

Chase reportedly suffered from depression and alcoholism for most of his professional career, and his tumultuous lifestyle began to take a serious toll on his health. His hair had turned prematurely gray, and he dyed it jet-black for his Columbia comedies. Years later Hal Roach said &quot;I never saw him drunk at the studio, and I never saw him sober outside of it.&quot; 

His younger brother, comedy writer-director James Parrott, had personal problems resulting from a drug treatment (his diet medications were actually addictive amphetamines) and died in 1939. Chase was devastated. He had refused to give his brother money to support his drug habit, and friends knew he felt responsible for Parrott&#x27;s death. He coped with the loss by throwing himself into his work and by drinking more heavily than ever, despite doctors&#x27; warnings. The stress ultimately caught up with him; just over a year after his brother&#x27;s death, Charley Chase died of a heart attack in Hollywood, California, on June 20, 1940. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery near his wife Bebe Eltinge in Glendale, California. 

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Charley Chase received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6630 Hollywood Boulevard on February 8, 1960.

==Revivals==
Hal Roach licensed his film library to Film Classics, which re-released the Chase films to theaters in the 1940s. (The company refilmed the titles to eliminate the MGM logo and trademark, and misspelled Chase&#x27;s name as &quot;Charlie&quot;.) In 1950 the Hal Roach comedies were released to syndicated television, and Charley Chase was introduced to new audiences.

Columbia&#x27;s Charley Chase comedies, unlike most of the Columbia short-subject series, were never re-released to theaters in later years; they only played first-run. Instead, the Chase &quot;scripts&quot; were recycled; 12 of the 20 stories were strong enough to be remade in the 1940s with other comedians. For example, Chase&#x27;s &quot;The Heckler&quot; (1940) was remade with Shemp Howard as &quot;Mr. Noisy&quot; (1946), &quot;The Wrong Miss Wright&quot; (1937) was remade with Vera Vague as &quot;You Dear Boy!&quot; (1943), &quot;The Big Squirt&quot; was remade with Bert Wheeler as &quot;The Awful Sleuth&quot; (1951), and &quot;The Nightshirt Bandit&quot; (1938) was remade with Andy Clyde as &quot;Go Chase Yourself&quot; (1948) and &quot;Pardon My Nightshirt&quot; (1956).

Producer Robert Youngson featured Charley Chase in his feature-length compilations of silent comedies, beginning with &quot;The Golden Age of Comedy&quot; (1957) and ending with &quot;4 Clowns&quot; (1970).

Since the 1990s, there has been a revival of interest in the films of Charley Chase, due in large part to the increased availability of his comedies. An extensive website researching his life and work, &quot;The World of Charley Chase&quot;, was created in 1996. Two books devoted to Chase followed: a biography, &quot;Smile When the Raindrops Fall&quot;, was published in 1998; &quot;The Charley Chase Scrapbook&quot;, compiled from Chase&#x27;s own collections of photos, writings, and souvenirs, was published in 2016.

Chase&#x27;s sound comedies for Hal Roach were briefly televised in the late 1990s on the short-lived American cable network the Odyssey Channel. Retrospectives of Chase&#x27;s work organized by &quot;The Silent Clowns Film Series&quot; were held in 1999, 2001, 2006, 2008, 2018, and 2022 in New York City.

A marathon of selected Charley Chase shorts from the silent era was broadcast in 2005 on the American cable television network Turner Classic Movies. In late 2006, Turner Classic Movies began to air Charley Chase&#x27;s sound-era comedies. In January 2011, several of his sound shorts were featured during Turner Classic Movies&#x27; tribute to Hal Roach Studios.

In 2007, &quot;Mighty Like a Moose&quot; (1926) was selected for inclusion in the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Film Registry, solidifying its reputation as one of the most celebrated comedies of the silent era and cementing Chase&#x27;s status as a pioneer of early film comedy.

Kino International released two Charley Chase DVD volumes in 2004 and 2005 for their &quot;Slapstick Symposium&quot; series. The films came from archives and collectors around the world. In 2009, VCI Entertainment released &quot;Becoming Charley Chase&quot;, a DVD boxed set of Charley Chase&#x27;s early silent films.

In 2013, Sony Home Entertainment released digital restorations of Charley Chase&#x27;s twenty short comedies for Columbia Pictures (1937–1940) as part of its &quot;Columbia Choice Collection&quot; DVD series.

During 2018–2022, the entire run of Charley Chase&#x27;s sound-era short comedies for Hal Roach, produced between 1929 and 1936, was released on DVD in four volumes by Kit Parker Films. In 2024 Parker released Blu-Ray and DVD volumes of Charley Chase&#x27;s vintage-1927 silent comedies.
