<text>In philosophy, supervenience refers to a relation between sets of properties or sets of facts. X is said to supervene on Y if and only if some difference in Y is necessary for any difference in X to be possible.

Examples of supervenience, in which case the truth values of some propositions cannot vary unless the truth values of some other propositions vary, include:
* Whether there is a table in the living room supervenes on the positions of molecules in the living room.
* The truth value of (A) supervenes on the truth value of its negation, (¬A), and vice versa.
* Properties of individual molecules supervene on the properties of individual atoms. 
* One&#x27;s moral character supervenes on one&#x27;s action(s).

Supervenience is of interest to philosophers because it differs from other nearby relations, for example &quot;entailment&quot;. Some philosophers believe it possible for some A to supervene on some B without being entailed by B. In such cases it may seem puzzling why A should supervene on B and equivalently why changes in A should require changes in B. Two important applications of supervenience involve cases like this. One of these is the supervenience of mental properties (like the sensation of pain) on physical properties (like the firing of &#x27;pain neurons&#x27;). A second is the supervenience of normative facts (facts about how things ought to be) on natural facts (facts about how things are).

It is sometimes claimed that what is at issue in these problems is the supervenience claim itself. For example, it has been claimed that what is at issue with respect to the mind-body problem is whether mental phenomena do in fact supervene on physical phenomena. This is incorrect. It is by and large agreed that some form of supervenience holds in these cases: Pain happens when the appropriate neurons fire. The disagreement is over why this is so. Materialists claim that we observe supervenience because the neural phenomena entail the mental phenomena, while dualists deny this. The dualist&#x27;s challenge is to explain supervenience without entailment.

The problem is similar with respect to the supervenience of normative facts on natural facts. Discussing the &quot;is-ought problem&quot; it is agreed that facts about how persons ought to act are not entailed by natural facts but cannot vary unless natural facts vary, and this rigid binding without entailment might seem puzzling.

The possibility of &quot;supervenience without entailment&quot; or &quot;supervenience without reduction&quot; is contested territory among philosophers.

== History ==

Supervenience, which means literally &quot;coming or occurring as something novel, additional, or unexpected&quot;, from &quot;super,&quot; meaning on, above, or additional, and &quot;venire,&quot; meaning to come in Latin, shows occurrences in the Oxford English Dictionary dating back to 1844.

Its systematic use in philosophy is considered to have begun in early 20th-century meta-ethics and emergentism. As G.E. Moore wrote in 1922, &quot;if a given thing possesses any kind of intrinsic value in a certain degree, then... anything &quot;exactly like it&quot;, must, under all circumstances, possess it in exactly the same degree&quot; (p. 261). This usage also carried over into the work of R. M. Hare. For discussion of the emergentist roots of supervenience see Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Supervenience.

In the 1970s, Donald Davidson was the first to use the term to describe a broadly physicalist (and non-reductive) approach to the philosophy of mind, called &quot;anomalous monism&quot;. As he said in 1970, &quot;supervenience might be taken to mean that there cannot be two events alike in all physical respects but differing in some mental respects, or that an object cannot alter in some mental respects without altering in some physical respects.&quot;

In subsequent years Terence (&quot;Terry&quot;) Horgan, David Lewis, and especially Jaegwon Kim formalized the concept and began applying it to many issues in the philosophy of mind. This raised numerous questions about how various formulations relate to one another, how adequate the formulation is to various philosophical tasks (in particular, the task of formulating physicalism), and whether it avoids or entails reductionism.

== Definitions ==

In the contemporary literature, there are two primary (and non-equivalent) formulations of supervenience (for both definitions let A and B be sets of properties).

(1) A-properties supervene on B-properties if and only if all things that are B-indiscernible are A-indiscernible. Formally:
*formula_1
(2) A-properties supervene on B-properties if and only if anything that has an A-property has some B-property such that anything that has that B-property also has that A-property. Formally:
*formula_2

For example, if one lets A be a set of mental properties, lets B be a set of physical properties, and chooses a domain of discourse consisting of persons, then (1) says that any two persons who are physically indiscernible are mentally indiscernible, and (2) says that any person who has a mental property has some physical property such that any person with that physical property has that mental property.

Some points of clarification: first, the definitions above involve quantification over properties and hence higher-order logic. Second, in (1), expressions of the form formula_3 capture the concept of sharing all properties, or being indiscernible with respect to a set of properties. Thus, (1) can be understood more intuitively as the claim that all objects that are indiscernible with respect to a base set of properties are indiscernible with respect to a supervenient set of properties, or, as it is also sometimes said, that B-twins are A-twins. Finally, supervenience claims typically involve some modal force, however, the way that modal force is specified depends on which more specific variety of supervenience one decides upon (see below).

(1) and (2) are sometimes called &quot;schemata&quot; because they do not correspond to actual supervenience relations until the sets of properties A and B, the domain of entities to which those properties apply, and a modal force have been specified. For modal forms of supervenience, the modal strength of the relation is usually taken to be a parameter (that is, the possible worlds appealed to may be physically possible, logically possible, etc.). Also, note that in the early literature properties were not always central, and there remain some who prefer to frame the relation in terms of predicates, facts, or entities instead, for example.

== Varieties of supervenience ==
Beginning in the 1980s, inspired largely by Jaegwon Kim&#x27;s work, philosophers proposed many varieties of supervenience, which David Lewis called the &quot;unlovely proliferation&quot;. These varieties are based both on (1) and (2) above, but because (1) is more common we shall focus on varieties of supervenience based on it.

We can begin by distinguishing between local and global supervenience:

* Local: For any two objects x and y, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

For example, if mental states locally supervene on brain states, then being in the same brain state entails being in the same mental state.

* Global: For any two worlds w1 and w2, if w1 and w2 are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

For example, if psychological properties globally supervene on physical properties, then any two worlds physically the same will be psychologically the same. The value of global supervenience is that it allows for supervenient properties to be determined not by local properties of an individual thing alone, but by some wider spatiotemporal distribution of things and properties. For example, something&#x27;s being a dollar bill depends not only on the paper and the inks it is made out of, but also on a widely dispersed variety of features of the world it occupies.

Both local and global supervenience come in many forms. Local supervenience comes in strong and weak varieties:

* Weak: For any world w, and for any two objects x in w and y in w, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.
* Strong: For any worlds w1 and w2, and for any two objects x in w1 and y in w2, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

The difference is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across possible worlds. For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, will also be psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can be different in different worlds. For example, my physical duplicates in the actual world will have the same thoughts as I have; but my physical duplicates in other possible worlds may have different thoughts than I have in the actual world.

There are also several kinds of global supervenience relations, which were introduced to handle cases in which worlds are the same at the base level and also at the supervenient level, but where the ways the properties are connected and distributed in the worlds differ. For example, it is consistent with global mental–physical supervenience on the simple formulation described above for two worlds to have the same number of people in the same physical states, but for the mental states to be distributed over those people in different ways (e.g. I have my father&#x27;s thoughts in the other world, and he has my thoughts). To handle this, property-preserving isomorphisms (1-1 and onto functions between the objects of two worlds, whereby an object in one world has a property if and only if the object which that function takes you to in the other world does) are used, and once this is done, several varieties of global supervenience can be defined.

Other varieties of supervenience include multiple-domains supervenience and similarity-based supervenience.

==Examples of supervenient properties==

===Value properties===
The value of a physical object to an is sometimes held to be supervenient upon the physical properties of the object. In aesthetics, the beauty of La Grande Jatte might supervene on the physical composition of the painting (the specific molecules that make up the painting), the artistic composition of the painting (in this case, dots), the figures and forms of the painted image, or the painted canvas as a whole. In ethics, the goodness of an act of charity might supervene on the physical properties of the agent, the mental state of the agent (his or her intention), or the external state of affairs itself. Similarly, the overall suffering caused by an earthquake might supervene on the spatiotemporal entities that constituted it, the deaths it caused, or the natural disaster itself. The claim that moral properties are supervenient upon non-moral properties is called moral supervenience.

===Mental properties===
In philosophy of mind, many philosophers make the general claim that the mental supervenes on the physical. In its most recent form this position derives from the work of Donald Davidson, although in more rudimentary forms it had been advanced earlier by others. The claim can be taken in several senses, perhaps most simply in the sense that the mental &quot;properties&quot; of a person are supervenient on their physical &quot;properties&quot;. Then:

* If two persons are indistinguishable in all of their physical properties, they must also be indistinguishable in all of their mental properties.

An alternative claim, advanced especially by John Haugeland, is a kind of &quot;weak local&quot; supervenience claim; or, weaker still, mere &quot;global&quot; supervenience. The claim that mental properties supervene globally on physical properties requires only a quite modest commitment: any difference between two possible worlds with respect to their instantiated mental properties entails at least &quot;some&quot; difference in the physical properties instantiated in those two worlds. Importantly, it does &quot;not&quot; require that the mental properties of an individual person supervene &quot;only&quot; on that person&#x27;s physical state.

This weak global thesis is particularly important in the light of direct reference theories, and semantic externalism with regard to the content both of words and (more relevant to our concerns here) of &quot;thoughts&quot;. Imagine two persons who are indistinguishable in their local physical properties. One has a dog in front of his eyes and the other has a dog-image artificially projected onto his retinae. It might be reasonable to say that the former is in the &quot;mental state&quot; of seeing a dog (and of knowing that he does so), whereas the latter is not in such a state of seeing a dog (but falsely believes that he sees one).

There is also discussion among philosophers about mental supervenience and our experience of duration. If all mental properties supervene only upon some physical properties at durationless moments, then it may be difficult to explain our experience of duration. The philosophical belief that mental and physical events exist as a series of durationless moments that lie between the physical past and the physical future is known as presentism.

===Computational properties===
There are several examples of supervenience to be found in computer networking. For example, in a dial-up internet connection, the audio signal on a phone line transports IP packets between the user&#x27;s computer and the Internet service provider&#x27;s computer. In this case, the arrangement of bytes in that packet supervenes on the physical properties of the phone signal. More generally, each layer of the OSI Model of computer networking supervenes on the layers below it.

We can find supervenience wherever a message is conveyed by a representational medium. When we see a letter &quot;a&quot; in a page of print, for example, the meaning &quot;Latin lowercase &quot;a&quot;&quot; supervenes on the geometry of the boundary of the printed glyph, which in turn supervenes on the ink deposition on the paper.

===Biological properties===
In biological systems phenotype can be said to supervene on genotype. This is because any genotype encodes a finite set of unique phenotypes, but any given phenotype is not produced by a finite set of genotypes. Innumerable examples of convergent evolution can be used to support this claim. Throughout nature, convergent evolution produces incredibly similar phenotypes from a diverse set of taxa with fundamentally different genotypes underpinning the phenotypes. One example is evolution on islands which is a remarkably predictable example of convergent evolution where the same phenotypes consistently evolve for the same reasons. Organisms released from predation tend to become larger, while organisms limited by food tend to become smaller. Yet there are almost infinite numbers of genetic changes that might lead to changes in body size. Another example of convergent evolution is the loss of sight that almost universally occurs in cave fish living in lightless pools. Eyes are expensive, and in lightless cave pools there is little reason for fish to have eyes. Yet, despite the remarkably consistent convergent evolution producing sightless cave fish, the genetics that produce the loss of sight phenotype is different nearly every time. This is because phenotype supervenes on genotype.

==Arguments against supervenience-based formulations of physicalism==
Although supervenience seems to be perfectly suited to explain the predictions of physicalism (i.e. the mental is dependent on the physical), there are four main problems with it. They are &quot;Epiphenomenal ectoplasm&quot;, the &quot;lone ammonium molecule problem&quot;, &quot;modal status problem&quot; and the &quot;problem of necessary beings.&quot;

=== Epiphenomenal ectoplasm ===

&quot;Epiphenomenal ectoplasm&quot; was proposed by Horgan and Lewis in 1983; they envisioned a possible world (a world that could possibly exist) &quot;W&quot; which is identical to our world in the distribution of all mental and physical characteristics (i.e. they are identical), except world &quot;W&quot; contains an experience called &quot;epiphenomenal ectoplasm&quot; that does not causally interact with that world. The possibility of such a world should be compatible with physicalism as this is a property of the actual world; but a supervenience-based definition of physicalism would imply that such a world could not exist, because it differs from the actual world with respect to a mental property, but is physically identical.
A typical response to this objection is Frank Jackson&#x27;s; he adjusted the supervenience-based definition of physicalism to state &quot;Physicalism is true at a possible world &quot;W&quot; if and only if any world which is a minimal physical duplicate (i.e. is physically identical) of &quot;W&quot; is a duplicate of &quot;W simpliciter.&quot;&quot; This avoids the problem because the &quot;ectoplasm&quot; world is not a minimal physical duplicate, so its identity with the actual world need not follow.

=== The lone ammonium molecule problem ===

The &quot;lone ammonium molecule problem&quot; provides a problem for Jackson&#x27;s solution to &quot;epiphenomenal ectoplasm&quot;. It was proposed by Jaegwon Kim in 1993 when he stated that according to Jackson&#x27;s idea of supervenience, a possible world &quot;W&quot; was identical to the actual world, except it possessed an extra ammonium molecule on one of Saturn&#x27;s rings. This may not seem to provide much of a problem, but because Jackson&#x27;s solution refers only to minimal physical duplicates, this allows for the mental properties of &quot;W&quot; to be vastly different from those in the actual world. If such a difference would cause mental differences on Earth, it would not be consistent with our understanding of physicalism.

=== Modal status ===

Suppose that the supervenience thesis for physicalism is stated as a nomological constraint, rather than a metaphysical one; this avoids any objection based on the thesis ruling out metaphysical possibilities which a physicalist would leave open. But the thesis would not rule out the metaphysical possibility of philosophical zombies, although their impossibility is a clear consequence of physicalism.

=== Problem of necessary beings ===

The &quot;problem of necessary beings&quot; was proposed by Jackson in 1998, in which he stated that the existence of a non-physical necessary being (in all possible worlds) would prove physicalism false. However, physicalism allows for the existence of necessary beings, because any minimal physical duplicate would have the same necessary being as the actual world. This however is paradoxical, based on the fact that physicalism both permits and prevents the existence of such beings.

<doc id="350992" wikidata="Q3401418" url="?curid=350992" title="Anti-competitive practices">
<text>Anti-competitive practices are business or government practices that prevent or reduce competition in a market. Antitrust laws ensure businesses do not engage in competitive practices that harm other, usually smaller, businesses or consumers. These laws are formed to promote healthy competition within a free market by limiting the abuse of monopoly power. Competition allows companies to compete in order for products and services to improve; promote innovation; and provide more choices for consumers. In order to obtain greater profits, some large enterprises take advantage of market power to hinder survival of new entrants. Anti-competitive behavior can undermine the efficiency and fairness of the market, leaving consumers with little choice to obtain a reasonable quality of service.

Anti-competitive behavior refers to actions taken by a business or organization to limit, restrict or eliminate competition in a market, usually in order to gain an unfair advantage or dominate the market. These practices are often considered illegal or unethical and can harm consumers, other businesses and the broader economy. Anti-competitive behavior is used by business and governments to lessen competition within the markets so that monopolies and dominant firms can generate supernormal profit margins and deter competitors from the market. Therefore, it is heavily regulated and punishable by law in cases where it substantially affects the market.

Anti-competitive practices are commonly only deemed illegal when the practice results in a substantial dampening in competition, hence why for a firm to be punished for any form of anti-competitive behavior they generally need to be a monopoly or a dominant firm in a duopoly or oligopoly who has significant influence over the market.

== Types ==
Anti-competitive behavior can be grouped into two classifications. Horizontal restraints regard anti-competitive behavior that involves competitors at the same level of the supply chain. These practices include mergers, cartels, collusions, price-fixing, price discrimination and predatory pricing. On the other hand, the second category is vertical restraint which implements restraints against competitors due to anti-competitive practice between firms at different levels of the supply chain e.g. supplier-distributor relationships. These practices include exclusive dealing, refusal to deal/sell, resale price maintenance and more.

=== Horizontal integration ===
Horizontal integration can result in economies of scale, economies of density and be anti-competitive. When two companies with similar products or product characteristics merge horizontally, there is less competition. Horizontal mergers can also easily lead to a monopoly, reducing consumers&#x27; choices and indirectly harming consumers&#x27; interests.

=== Vertical integration ===
Vertical integration can result in economies of scope and reduce the hold-up problem and be anti-competitive. In absence of perfect competition Chicago school of economics argues vertical integration may be pro-competitive by reducing double marginalization.

==Common anti-competitive actions==
* Dumping, also known as predatory pricing, is a commercial strategy for which a company sells a product at an aggressively low price in a competitive market at a loss. A company with large market share and the ability to temporarily sacrifice selling a product or service at below average cost can drive competitors out of the market, after which the company would be free to raise prices for a greater profit. For example, many developing countries have accused China of dumping. In 2006, the country was accused of dumping silk and satin in the Indian markets at a cheaper rate which affected the local manufacturers adversely.
* Exclusive dealing, where a retailer or wholesaler is obliged by contract to only purchase from the contracted supplier. This mechanism prevents retailers to lessen profit maximisation and/or consumer choice. In 1999, Dentsply entered a 7 years court complaint by the U.S, the dental wholesaler had been successfully sued for using monopoly power to restrain trade using exclusive dealings within contract requirements.
* Price fixing, where companies collude to set prices, effectively dismantling the free market by not engaging in competition with each other. In 2018, travel agency giant, Flight Centre was fined $12.5 million for encouraging a collusive price fixing plan between 3 international airlines from between 2005 and 2009.
* Refusal to deal, e.g., two companies agree not to use a certain vendor. In 2010, Cabcharge refused, on commercial terms, to allow its non-cash payment instruments to be accepted and processed electronically by Travel Tab/Mpos&#x27; system for the payment of taxi fares. Travel Tab/Mpos requested access to the instruments but Cabcharge refused twice. Penalties for the first and second refusal were $2 million and $9 million respectively.
* Dividing territories, an agreement by two companies to stay out of each other&#x27;s way and reduce competition in the agreed-upon territories. Also known as &#x27;market sharing&#x27;, a practice in which businesses geographically divide or allocate customers using contractual agreements that include non-competition on established customers, not producing the same goods or services and/or selling within specific regions. Boral and CSR formed a pre-mix concrete cartel and were penalized for bid rigging, price fixing and market sharing at an amount over $6.6million and a maximum of $100,000 on each of the 6 executives involved. The companies had agreed to recognize clients as belonging to suppliers without competition over regular meetings and phone conversations. Company market shares were monitored to ensure the agreement was not breached - this led to over-charging on construction quotes which were used by federal, state and local government projects.
* Tying, where products that are not naturally related must be purchased together. This incumbent strategy forces the buyer to purchase an unnecessary product from a separate market, implicitly lessening competition in various markets by increasing unnatural barriers to entry as entrants are unable to compete on a full line of products nor on price. In 2006, Apple iTunes iPod lost a $10 million 10 year antitrust case when iPods were sold between September 2006 to March 2009 that were only compatible with tracks from the iTunes Store or those downloaded from CDs.
* Resale price maintenance, when a manager sells to a distributor, the resale price is agreed to not fall below a specified minimum value. However, when the retail price decreases, the manufacturer does sell more products. This is interesting from a management perspective. This strategy is controversial, and the benefits are to protect some inefficient small stores or manufacturers from competition threats. But at the same time, this strategy can easily lead to the level price cartel of brand operators.
* Natural monopoly: This type of monopoly occurs when a firm can efficiently supply the entire market due to economies of scale, where larger production leads to lower costs. For example, in some cases, utilities (such as those providing electricity or water) may operate as natural monopolies due to high infrastructure and distribution costs.
* Technology monopoly: This type of monopoly occurs when one company has exclusive control over a particular technology or innovation, thus enabling them to dominate the market. For example, a company that owns a patent for a breakthrough technology may have a technology monopoly.
* Legal loopholes: This type of monopoly occurs when the government grants a company exclusive rights or privileges to operate in a particular market. For example, patents and Copyrights provide temporary monopolies to inventors and creators to encourage innovation and creativity.

Unfair competition includes a number of areas of law involving acts by one competitor or group of competitors which harm another in the field, and which may give rise to criminal offenses and civil causes of action. The most common actions falling under the banner of unfair competition include:
* Matters pertaining to antitrust law, known in the European Union as competition law. Antitrust violations constituting unfair competition occur when one competitor attempts to force others out of the market (or prevent others from entering the market) through tactics such as predatory pricing or obtaining exclusive purchase rights to raw materials needed to make a competing product.
* Trademark infringement and passing off, which occur when the maker of a product uses a name, logo, or other identifying characteristics to deceive consumers into thinking that they are buying the product of a competitor. In the United States, this form of unfair competition is prohibited under the common law and by state statutes, and governed at the federal level by the Lanham Act.
* Misappropriation of trade secrets, which occurs when one competitor uses espionage, bribery, or outright theft to obtain economically advantageous information in the possession of another. In the United States, this type of activity is forbidden by the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and the Economic Espionage Act of 1996.
* Trade libel, the spreading of false information about the quality or characteristics of a competitor&#x27;s products, is prohibited at common law.
* Tortious interference, which occurs when one competitor convinces a party having a relationship with another competitor to breach a contract with, or duty to, the other competitor is also prohibited at common law.
* Anti-competitive agreements: Firms may enter into agreements that limit competition, such as agreements to fix prices, limit production or supply, or divide markets. These agreements harm competition, reduce consumer choice and lead to higher prices or lower quality products or services.
* Mergers and acquisitions that harm competition: Mergers and acquisitions that result in a significant reduction in market competition may be considered anti-competitive. This may include actions such as acquiring a competitor to eliminate or reduce competition, or merging to form a dominant market player who may engage in anti-competitive behavior.
* Exclusive deals or tie-in arrangements: Companies may enter into exclusive deals or tie-in arrangements that require customers or suppliers to trade with them exclusively or purchase one product or service in order to obtain another. These practices can limit consumer choice and limit competition by preventing competitors from entering major distribution channels or markets.

Also criticized are:
* Absorption of a competitor or competing technology, where a powerful firm effectively co-opts or swallows its competitor rather than let it either compete directly or be absorbed by another firm
* Subsidies from government which allow a firm to function without being profitable, giving them an advantage over competition or effectively barring competition
* Regulations which place costly restrictions on firms that less wealthy firms cannot afford to implement
* Protectionism, tariffs and quotas which give firms insulation from competitive forces
* Patent misuse and copyright misuse, such as fraudulently obtaining a patent, copyright, or other form of intellectual property; or using such legal devices to gain advantage in an unrelated market
* Digital rights management which prevents owners from selling used media, as would normally be allowed by the first sale doctrine.
* Occupational licensing

Various unfair business practices such as fraud, misrepresentation, and unconscionable contracts may be considered unfair competition, if they give one competitor an advantage over others. In the European Union, each member state must regulate unfair business practices in accordance with the principles laid down in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, subject to transitional periods.

<doc id="350998" wikidata="Q5193681" url="?curid=350998" title="Culture of Öland">
<text>The Borgholm Castle built 1669-1681 for Queen Hedvig Eleonora, and designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. Located in the vicinity is also Solliden Palace, summer home to the royal family. The castle was once integrated with the Halltorps royal estate.

The agricultural landscape of southern Öland, which is known as the Stora Alvaret or Great Alvar, has been entered as a site of the UNESCO World heritage program. Features of this are the many windmills left standing and the special geological landscape called &quot;Alvar&quot;. This low lying limestone plateau is the habitat of a number of rare species of endemic wildflowers and butterflies.

For a decade, Öland has been organizing an annual harvest festival called Skördefesten that takes place every October. In terms of this event, the island&#x27;s farmers gather with farmers from the rest of the country and sell their crops and let those that are interested take part in everyday life on their farms, among other activities. There are also many art exhibitions for display during Skördefesten especially during the art night Konstnatten.

The romantic poet Erik Johan Stagnelius was born in the Öland parish of Gärdslösa in 1793 and lived there until 16 years of age. He wrote several poems about the island. More modern writers living on or writing about Öland include novelist Margit Friberg (1904–1997), poet Anna Rydstedt (1928–1994), novelist Birgitta Trotzig (1929-2011), poet Lennart Sjögren (1930-), children novelist Eva Bexell (1945-), poet Tom Hedlund (1945-), novelist Johan Theorin (1963-), poet and novelist Magnus Utvik (1964-) and novelist Per Planhammar (1965-).

<doc id="351001" wikidata="Q748078" url="?curid=351001" title="Neath Port Talbot">
<text>Neath Port Talbot () is a county borough in the south-west of Wales. Its principal towns are Neath, Port Talbot, Briton Ferry and Pontardawe. The county borough borders Bridgend County Borough and Rhondda Cynon Taf to the east, Powys and Carmarthenshire to the north; and Swansea to the west.

Neath Port Talbot is the eighth-most populous local authority area in Wales and the third most populous county borough. The population at the October 2024 about 141,900. The population in the coastal areas is mainly English-speaking, whereas in the valleys in the north of the borough there are many who are Welsh-speaking.

==Geography==
The local authority area stretches from the coast to the border of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The majority of the land is upland or semi-upland and 43% is covered by forestry with major conifer plantations in upland areas. Most of the lower-lying flat land is near the coast around Port Talbot. An extensive dune system stretches along much of the coast, broken by river mouths and areas of development. The upland areas are cut by five valleys: Vale of Neath, Dulais Valley, Afan Valley, Swansea Valley (or Tawe Valley), Upper Amman Valley.

Modern settlement patterns reflect the industrial history of the area, with urban development along the flatter areas of the valleys and some parts of the coast. Neath with a population of 47,020 is the largest town, followed by Port Talbot (35,633), Briton Ferry (7,186), Pontardawe (5,035), and Glynneath (4,368). The majority of the population live in the coastal plain around Port Talbot and the land around the River Neath in the vicinity of Neath. Many of the larger towns in the borough lie within the Swansea Urban Area.
==Demographics==
The population in the region reached its peak in the 1930s. Census figures show a population of 151,563 in 1931. The population has shown a steady decline throughout the rest of the 20th century. The population stood at 134,471 in 2001. In the 1990s, most areas within the region showed a fall or little change in population with the notable exception of Bryncoch South and Margam where the population grew by 47.29% and 41.36% respectively.
 Local council estimates show the population to have grown during the 2000s.

According to the ONS census of 2021, Neath Port Talbot is roughly 97% White British.

==Government and politics==
On 1 April 1996, Neath Port Talbot was created from the former districts of Neath, Port Talbot and part of Lliw Valley. Originally known as &quot;Neath and Port Talbot&quot; in the legislation, the name change happened on the following day. At the time of the reorganisation, many local people expected that Neath and Port Talbot districts would become separate unitary authorities, and there were protests when the new authority was announced.

===Local government===
The whole of the Neath Port Talbot area was once part of the county of West Glamorgan, which in turn is part of the historic county of Glamorgan. Since local government re-organisation in 1996, Neath Port Talbot is governed by Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council.

Neath Port Talbot is a staunch Labour stronghold, who have been in power since the authority&#x27;s formation in 1996; although after the 2022 local elections, Labour failed to retain control over the council after losing several council seats.

===Welsh politics===
The unitary authority contains two whole constituencies which are:
*Aberavon, current MS is David Rees, Labour since 2011
*Neath, current MS is Jeremy Miles, Labour since 2016

===United Kingdom politics===

*Aberafan Maesteg, current MP is Stephen Kinnock, Labour since 2024
*Neath and Swansea East, current MP is Carolyn Harris, Labour since 2024
*Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe, current MP is David Chadwick, Liberal Democrats since 2024.

==Economy and industry==

In 1991 Neath &amp; Port Talbot was a distinct travel to work area (albeit with different boundaries to the current county borough), but the 2001-based revision has merged the locality into a wider Swansea Bay travel to work area.

In June 2008, the economic activity and employment rates in Neath Port Talbot were below the Welsh average. However, earnings for full-time workers were higher than either the Welsh or British average.

Manufacturing accounts for over 22% of jobs in the county borough compared to under than 14% in Wales as a whole; just under 70% of local jobs are in services compared to a Welsh average of nearly 80%. The Port Talbot Steelworks, operated by Tata, is the largest employer with approximately 3,000 staff (although in 1979 its predecessor employed 12,600); other large employers include General Electric, Hi-Lex Cable Systems Ltd (closing in 2021 ), TRW Steering Systems recently closed, Envases (UK) Ltd, Crown Food UK &amp; Ireland, Toyoda Koki, Sofidel, Cornelius Electronics, Excel Electronics Assemblies, and Tedeco.

Port Talbot is also the site for Neath Port Talbot Hospital which is situated on Baglan Way, Port Talbot.

==Education==
The local Neath Port Talbot Council is the education authority in the area which operates primary schools and secondary schools within the county. The local education authority operates 6 infant schools, 6 junior schools, 56 primary schools, 11 secondary schools and 3 special schools.

Further Education in Neath Port Talbot is provided by a range of institutions. St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School &amp; Sixth Form Centre in Port Talbot and Ysgol Gyfun Ystalyfera have traditional sixth form settings. NPTC Group operates from several sites within the county borough. The largest sites are located in Neath, Port Talbot and Pontardawe.

The first dedicated higher education site in Neath Port Talbot opened in 2015 when Swansea University opened its science and innovation campus in Crymlyn Burrows.

The University of South Wales has a campus located at Baglan Energy Park in Port Talbot. The Baglan campus houses a Renewable Hydrogen Research and Development Centre.

==Media==

A separate daily edition of the &quot;South Wales Evening Post&quot; is published for the Neath Port Talbot area. The paper&#x27;s publisher, Reach plc, also produces a free weekly paper, the &quot;Neath Port Talbot Courier&quot;, which is inserted in Thursday&#x27;s edition of the South Wales Evening Post. The local council publishes a quarterly, &quot;Community Spirit&quot;, produced and funded in conjunction with seven other public sector partners.

Community radio station is XS broadcasts to both Neath (97.4) and Port Talbot (107.9). Nation Radio Wales briefly broadcast to the wider South Wales region from studios in Neath, but is now based in Cardiff. The county borough is within the local commercial radio licence areas of Hits Radio South Wales, its sister station Greatest Hits Radio South Wales, Swansea Bay Radio and Heart South Wales.

<doc id="351004" wikidata="Q817960" url="?curid=351004" title="Rhondda Cynon Taf">
<text>Rhondda Cynon Taf (; RCT; also spelt as Rhondda Cynon Taff) is a county borough in the south-east of Wales. It consists of five valleys: the Rhondda Fawr, Rhondda Fach, Cynon, Taff () and Ely valleys, plus several towns and villages away from the valleys.

Results from the 2011 census showed 19.1% of its 234,410 residents self-identified as having some ability in the use of the Welsh language. The county borough borders Merthyr Tydfil County Borough and Caerphilly County Borough to the east, Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan to the south, Bridgend County Borough and Neath Port Talbot to the west and Powys to the north. Its principal towns are - Aberdare, Llantrisant with Talbot Green and Pontypridd, with other key settlements/towns being - Maerdy, Ferndale, Hirwaun, Llanharan, Mountain Ash, Porth, Tonypandy, Tonyrefail and Treorchy.

The most populous individual town in Rhondda Cynon Taf is Aberdare () with a population of 39,550 (2011), followed by Pontypridd with 32,694 (2011). The largest built-up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics is the Tonypandy built-up area, with a population of 62,545 (2011), which covers much of the Rhondda valley. The National Eisteddfod will be held at Rhondda Cynon Taf in 2024, postponed twice from 2022.

==History==
The county borough was formed on 1 April 1996 under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, by the merger of the former Mid Glamorgan districts of Rhondda, Cynon Valley and Taff-Ely (with the exceptions of Creigiau and Pentyrch, which were added to Cardiff). Its name reflects all these, and thus also the rivers Rhondda, Cynon and Taff. Pontypridd, a University and Market Town, is the principal town of Rhondda Cynon Taf; situated north of the capital city of Cardiff. Pontypridd is often abbreviated “Ponty” by local residents.

The new county borough was described in the 1994 Act with different spellings in English and Welsh: Rhondda Cynon Taff (English) / Rhondda Cynon Taf (Welsh). In 1999, the council officially changed the borough&#x27;s English language name to Rhondda Cynon Taf, allowing the same spelling to be used in both languages.

Some of Wales&#x27; most notorious unsolved murders occurred in Rhondda Cynon Taf in 1993, the murders of Harry and Megan Tooze in Llanharry.

==Industry==
The district developed from the discovery and mining, primarily for export, of high-quality Welsh coals, such as steam coal, via Cardiff and Barry docks. The landscape was dominated by coal waste heaps and deep mine pit-heads. Many of the roads are lined with semi-ribbon development of closely packed Victorian terraces of houses which have given the Rhondda and Cynon valleys their distinctive appearance. In the nineteenth century the Rhondda had over 60 mines.

As deep mines closed, a number of very large open-cast coal mines were created and remain in operation, especially towards the north of the area.

The Welsh Development Agency, which was formed in 1976 to help reverse the economic down-turn in Wales caused by the recession in both the coal and steel industries, was very active in the Rhondda Cynon Taf area in supporting and encouraging industrial and commercial regeneration.
Recent investment in the area has included the Dragon International Film Studios, on the site of Llanilid open-cast mine. The location of the project has led it to become known locally as &quot;Valleywood&quot;, even though the Welsh valleys are some miles away.

==Environment==

The coal industry has had major adverse impacts on the quality of the environment, such that most of the rivers were severely polluted to the exclusion of all fish life. Recent decades have shown great improvement with the return of salmon recorded in the River Taff and the River Rhondda but the continued presence of man-made obstacles in the rivers is inhibiting regeneration of their pre-industrial numbers and condition.

The chemical industry has also had adverse effects due to the dumping of toxic waste in the now disused Brofiscin Quarry in the village of Groes-faen. Dumping took place over a 6-year period between 1965 and 1970 by the Monsanto Company. Clean-up costs have been estimated to be over £100million. A Dr Papageorge, formerly Monsanto&#x27;s chief scientist, estimates that between 60,000 and 80,000 tonnes of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated wastes were dumped there. Works costing £1.25million to reduce health risks to local residents and members of the public using a nearby footpath were completed at the quarry in 2012. Monsanto, BP and Veolia contributed to the cost of the clean-up while continuing to deny liability.

==Government==

The area is governed by Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council from headquarters in Pontypridd and is the host authority to the South East Wales Improvement Collaborative (SEWIC), Excellence Wales award winner 2010. There are four constituencies represented in the Senedd (Welsh Parliament). Since 2024, Rhondda Cynon Taf is in five UK Parliament constituencies, Merthyr Tydfil and Aberdare, Rhondda and Ogmore, Pontypridd, Cardiff West, and Cardiff North.

<text>Television in Hong Kong is primarily in Cantonese and English. It is delivered through analogue and digital terrestrial, cable, IPTV, and the Internet. Satellite TV is not common, although many housing estates have dishes and re-distribute a limited number of free channels through coaxial cables. The dominant broadcaster is TVB, ViuTV and HOY TV.

==History==
Hong Kong&#x27;s television history began with the launch of Rediffusion Television (RTV) on 29 May 1957 (later renamed as Asia Television (ATV)). RTV started off as a cable subscription service but became a free-to-air broadcaster in 1973, with Cantonese and English channels. In April 2016, the Executive Council decided not to renew ATV&#x27;s broadcast licence and its channels closed.

Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) was the territory&#x27;s first free-to-air commercial station (launching in 1967) and remains the predominant TV broadcaster today with multiple Cantonese channels and one English channel, on analogue and digital.

A short-lived network, known as Commercial Television, opened in 1975 and operated for about three years until its bankruptcy (see 1970s in Hong Kong).

Government-owned Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) (a radio broadcaster from 1949) starting making TV programmes in 1976—to be aired on TVB and ATV and later on HKCTV and Now TV. In 2016, RTHK took over the analogue frequency of ATV and now also has its own digital channels.

HKTVE, commonly known as ViuTV started broadcasting in 2016, digital-only, with a Cantonese channel and an English channel.

In May 2017, Fantastic Television started digital free-to-air broadcasting, but after a year they moved their content to HKCTV.

There was also an Internet television and VOD channel called Hong Kong Technology Venture (HKTV, owned by the City Telecom, which was renamed as the same name in 2013) which was launched in 2014 and can be viewed on smart TVs, set-top boxes, personal computers, smartphones, and tablet computers, then closed in 2018. And ATV was revived as the OTT platform in 2017 and is still running today.

==Subscription networks==
* &quot;Cable TV Hong Kong (Hong Kong Cable Television Ltd)&quot;: controlled by Forever Top, operates over 100 channels with programmes broadcast in English, Cantonese, Putonghua and other languages.
* &quot;Now TV (PCCW-HKT Interactive Multimedia Services Ltd)&quot;: provides 25 free channels and over 200 pay channels with programmes broadcast in English language (Supreme Sports Pack, World Entertainment Pack 1 &amp; 2, Movies Pack 1 &amp; 2, International News Pack, Kids Pack, Knowledge Pack), Cantonese, Putonghua, Japanese and Korean (Chinese Movies Pack &amp; Asian Entertainment Pack), Pinoy (Filipino Pack), French (French Pack) and Indian (Indian Pack 1–3).
* &quot;TVB&#x27;s MyTV Super&quot;

==Satellite TV==
* &quot;Phoenix Television&quot;: also broadcast in Greater China

==Programming==
Hong Kong&#x27;s soap drama, comedy series and variety show productions reach mass audiences throughout the Cantonese-speaking, and even Mandarin-speaking, world.

==Regulatory control==
Television in Hong Kong is not subject to China&#x27;s regulatory or &#x27;content&#x27; control and is under the purview of the Communications Authority in Hong Kong.

== Digital terrestrial television ==
Hong Kong was not required to follow China&#x27;s DTT standard, but the Hong Kong government nevertheless opted to use DMB-T/H (now known as DTMB) as the digital terrestrial television broadcast standard in 2004 (hence rejecting the DVB-T standard originally proposed in 1998 and trialled in 2000). The official start of DTT broadcasting was at 7pm on 31 December 2007 as the first digital TV signal transmitter in Tsz Wan Shan went online.

In October 2007, both broadcasting companies agreed to use the MPEG2 video standard for broadcasting free-to-air channels (TVB Jade, ATV Home, TVB Pearl and ATV World); the H.264 video codec was implemented for all DTT-only channels.

For the audio codec, usual DTMB set-top boxes would support MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (MP2) for stereo audio tracks, and Dolby AC-3 for 5.1 surround sound audio tracks. The official specification defines standard-definition broadcasting as 576i at 50 fields per second and high-definition broadcasting in 720p at 50 Hz or 1080i at 50 Hz.

All major transmitters were completed by 2008, covering at least 75 percent of the Hong Kong population. The current coverage reaches 99% of the population. Full digital television broadcasts began on 1 December 2020, postponed from the originally planned date in 2015.

Starting 1 December 2021, six digital television channels (being TVB Jade, ViuTVsix, ViuTV, RTHK TV 31, RTHK TV 32 and RTHK TV 33) will transit from frequencies in the 600/700 MHz bands to the 500 MHz band to support and boost telecommunication services for applications like 5G networks as well as improving network coverage. A six-month transition stage from 1 April will simulcast TV channels on both existing and new frequencies to smoothen the transition.

<text>William Allen Alsop (12 December 1947 – 12 May 2018) was a British architect and Professor of Architecture at University for the Creative Arts&#x27;s Canterbury School of Architecture.

He was responsible for several distinctive and controversial modernist buildings which are usually distinguished by their use of bright colours and unusual &quot;avant-garde&quot; forms. In 2000, Alsop won the Stirling Prize, the most prestigious architecture award in the United Kingdom, for the Peckham Library in London.

==Biography==
Alsop always wanted to be an architect, even before he really knew what architects did; when he was six years old, he designed a house for his mother to live in – its most striking specification was that it had to be built in New Zealand. When he was 16 his father, an accountant, died, and being bored with school, at the private Eaglehurst College he left to work for an architect, doing his A-levels at evening classes.

He was greatly influenced by his drawing tutor, Henry Bird while at foundation course at Northampton Art School. He recalled how he was taught to draw by him. He gave me a brick, told me to draw it and promptly left the room. I proceeded to draw it with all its shadows. On his return he went into a rage and chastised me for destroying the vision with shading, shouting: &#x27;What is wrong with a simple line?&#x27; He insisted that I redo the drawing with line only so that I could begin to see the brick and its proportions. I drew that brick for two three hour sessions per week, line only, for three months. Eventually, he admitted that I had mastered the brick and I was allowed to progress onto the tin can.

Alsop then studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture where at 23 he entered the competition to design the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and came second to the eventual winners, Richard Rogers &amp; Renzo Piano. He worked briefly for Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, a couple who had been instrumental in introducing modernism to Britain in the 1930s, then joined Cedric Price for four years.

After a short period with Roderick Ham, in 1981 Alsop set up a practice, Alsop &amp; Lyall, with his classmate John Lyall in Hammersmith. Jan Störmer later joined the practice and a decade later, in 1991, the practice was renamed Alsop &amp; Störmer after Lyall&#x27;s departure.

Alsop&#x27;s first major commission was a swimming pool for Sheringham in Norfolk in 1984, followed by a visitor centre for Cardiff Bay. Thereafter he worked on a number of projects in Germany, including the Hamburg Ferry Terminal. In 1992, Alsop came first, against competitor Norman Foster, in the competition to design the Hôtel du département des Bouches-du-Rhône (the county government office of Bouches-du-Rhône) in Marseille, France. The building, now considered a major work of late 20th century architecture and a Marseille landmark, nicknamed &quot;Le Grand Bleu&quot;, was designed by Alsop and Störmer, and developed its visual identity through the design process in collaboration with the architectural artist Brian Clarke, with the completed building externally clad in Yves Klein blue glass, with one elevation formed of a 1,200 m2 artwork by Clarke screenprinted in ceramic glaze onto the facade. Alsop and Störmer divided into separate practices in 2000, with Alsop renaming the practice Alsop Architects.

Alsop admitted to never being very good at handling finances, and his practice went through several difficult periods, including the cancellation in June 2004 of plans to build a &quot;Fourth Grace&quot; to be built on Liverpool&#x27;s Pier Head waterfront. Since 2001–2002, three historical buildings at the Pier Head in Liverpool have been known as the &quot;Three Graces&quot;: they are the Royal Liver Building (1908–11) by Walter Aubrey Thomas, the Cunard Building (1914–16) by Willinck &amp; Thicknesse with Arthur J. Davis, and the Port of Liverpool Building (1903–07) by Briggs &amp; Wolstenholme with Hobbs &amp; Thornely – the so-called &quot;Cloud Building&quot; – officially because of rising costs and unrealistic design.

In early 2006, Alsop sold his practice to a design conglomerate called the SMC Group to concentrate on architecture.

After leaving ARCHIAL (formerly Alsop Architects, then SMC Alsop), he joined RMJM&#x27;s London Headquarters as International Principal on 1 October 2009. The office&#x27;s name was &quot;Will Alsop at RMJM&quot;. Alsop&#x27;s latest practice was called All Design and had practices in London and Chongqing. Alsop&#x27;s London office was located in Battersea.

Alsop was a tutor of sculpture at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London for several years, and held many other academic posts, among others at the Vienna University of Technology, Universities of London and Hannover, and actively promoted the artistic contribution to built environments.

In 2013, Alsop became Professor of Architecture at the University for the Creative Arts&#x27;s Canterbury School of Architecture.

Alsop was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and was elected to the Royal Academy on 18 May 2000.

==Architectural style==
Alsop&#x27;s architectural heroes were Le Corbusier, Sir John Soane, John Vanbrugh and Mies van der Rohe. His &quot;avant-garde&quot;, modernist buildings are usually distinguished by their vibrant use of bright colour and unusual forms. Before Alsop begins to work on a new project, he uses painting to clear his mind, think freely and create an uncontaminated design approach. &quot;One of the reasons for painting is that you are not really in control of what you are doing – and that interests me a lot. Instead of having a specific starting point, which perhaps, in architectural terms, would lead through to a series of logical thoughts working towards a designed building, you can start anywhere.&quot; 
For him, the act of painting together with working closely with the client and the local community are necessary ingredients in urban design and architecture.

In 2004, Alsop published a book entitled &quot;Supercity&quot; which elicited much debate. It was the subject of a Channel 4 television documentary and an exhibition at the Urbis museum in Manchester. This book described his vision of a &quot;Supercity&quot; – a futuristic conurbation – stretching along the M62 corridor from Liverpool to Hull. It included a discussion of how the increasing interconnectivity of the cities along this corridor is changing the concepts of a &quot;city&quot;, and how they can be developed to merge the idea of the rural and urban. It also included a number of architectural ideas of possible buildings and communities in this city. Although there was some political support for his ideas, with &quot;The Times&quot; claiming that former British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott was a supporter, the Supercity has its critics.

Alsop featured significantly in Iain Sinclair&#x27;s book &quot;Ghost Milk&quot; (2011), especially the chapter &quot;In the belly of the architect&quot;. The book is a critique – written using the literary technique of psychogeography – of the capital used to drive through vanity planning projects such as the London Olympics, and Alsop&#x27;s unbuilt planning projects in the north of England, such as Supercity, are seen as typical of these, where the architect fantasizes about how architectural design solves social and economic problems.

Alsop&#x27;s architectural talents may be the subject of controversy built up an international reputation and a degree of celebrity and professional recognition, described by the &quot;Observer&quot; as &quot;number three in the hierarchy of British architects after Lords Rogers and Foster&quot;.

Notwithstanding this, like fellow avantgardist Dame Zaha Hadid, he actualised relatively few buildings from his designs. Alsop estimated that only about 10% of his designs have been built, something he stated did not worry him because of the enjoyment he derived in designing buildings even without a particular commission or competition in mind. In a 2007 interview, Alsop stated &quot;It&#x27;s like tennis – you have to keep doing it all the time, whether you have a client or not. I believe that absolutely. You can speculate in your sketchbook – you&#x27;re allowed to think about anything, with or without a client.&quot;

In April 2007, &quot;The Observer&quot; commented that Alsop&#x27;s approach to architecture could broadly be defined by his statement: &quot;I like people. I hope it shows.&quot;

==Personal life==
Alsop and his wife lived between an Edwardian mansion flat in London and a converted stable block in Norfolk. They have three adult children.

He had a twin sister, Elizabeth, who still lives in Northampton.

Alsop would try to relax as much as possible on weekends and also took a month off in the summer to go painting in Menorca with his friend Bruce McLean. Alsop enjoyed smoking and drinking. He was, according to an April 2007 article in &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;obviously not a man familiar with gyms&quot;.

Alsop died in London after a short illness on 12 May 2018 at the age of 70.

<text>Srirangam is a neighbourhood in the city of Tiruchirappalli in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. A river island, Srirangam is bounded by the Kaveri River on one side and its distributary Kollidam on the other side. Considered as the first among the 108 Divya Desams, a group of Vishnu temples, it is famous for the Ranganathaswamy Temple, the largest temple complex in India and the biggest functioning Hindu temple in the world. Srirangam is also home to a significant population of Sri Vaishnavas (followers of Lakshmi and Vishnu).

== Etymology ==
Old Tamil literature refers to the place as Tiruvarangam. The name owes itself to the legend that once the holy vimana (Sriranga Vimana) of Vishnu, which is believed to have become stranded at this place. An isle lying in the midst of the winding branches of a river is called &quot;arangam&quot; in Tamil. Thus, the spot came to be known as Srirangam in Sanskrit (&quot;Shri-Rangam&quot;) and Tiruvarangam (Thiru + Arangam = Thiruvarangam) in Tamil. &quot;Shri&quot; in Sanskrit and &quot;Thiru&quot; in Tamil are prefixes indicating respect and reverence, i.e. &quot;Holy Rangam&quot;. 

==Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple==
Srirangam is famous for its Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, a major pilgrimage destination for Hindus (especially Sri Vaishnavas) and the largest temple complex in India.

According to the UNESCO, Srirangam is the biggest functioning Hindu temple in the world, as it covers an area of about with a perimeter of 4 km (10,710 ft), Angkor Wat which is also dedicated to Vishnu is even bigger but services do not take place any more in the temple.

Srirangam is one of a few self-manifested shrines (Svayam Vyakta Kshetras) of Vishnu. The temple complex spans . It has seven &quot;prakaras&quot; (enclosures). These enclosures are formed by tall, thick rampart walls running around the sanctum. There are 21 towers, gopurams, in all &quot;prakaras&quot; decreasing in height inwards. The temple town lies on an islet formed by the rivers Kaveri and Kollidam.

The southern &quot;gopuram&quot; of the temple, called the &quot;Rajagopuram&quot;, is 239.5 feet tall and, as of 2016, is the tallest in Asia. The construction of the Rajagopuram began during the reign of Achyuta Deva Raya of the Vijayanagara empire. However, construction was halted after his death and the structure of the Rajagopuram remained incomplete for over 400 years. The completion of the Rajagopuram was undertaken and completed successfully by Sri Vedanta Desika Yatheendra Mahadesikan, the 44th jeeyar of Sri Ahobila Matha. The construction spanned 8 years before it was consecrated on 25 March 1987.

In historic times, just after the construction of this temple, the city of Srirangam lived completely within the walls of this temple, and is often described as a Hindu religious utopia.

The Srirangam temple is one of the three temples of the deity Ranganatha (Antya Ranga) that are situated in the natural islands formed in the Kaveri river. They are:

*Adi Ranga: the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangapatna, Srirangapatna taluk, Mandya district, Karnataka, India
*Madhya Ranga: the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Shivanasamudra, Kollegala taluk, Chamarajanagara district, Karnataka, India
*Antya Ranga: the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam, Srirangam taluk, Tiruchirappalli district, Tamil Nadu, India

There is a gopuram fully made of gold, which is protected by an electrical fence. Clothes such as silk sarees, dhoti and towels, which are used for religious purposes are auctioned here.

Ramanuja (11th century), one of the most celebrated theologians of Hinduism, made his monastic home by the temple at Srirangam. Here he wrote his famous commentaries on the &quot;Brahma Sutra&quot;, which expressed a qualified non-dualism of the Vedanta, his Vishishtadvaita. Ramanuja&#x27;s body is said to come out of the Earth after he was buried and was preserved at this temple. Although, Ramanujar hailed from Sriperumbudur and a pivotal point in his lifetime, receiving the Ashtakshara mantram, happened in Thirukoshtiyur, he made Srirangam his home after the demise of his Acharya in spirit, Alavanthar or Yamunacharya.

Inside the temple complex, there is a separate temple dedicated to the goddess Andal. Additionally, there is a museum, a library and a bookshop.

== Legend ==
According to the regional legend, the deity Rama is regarded to have performed &quot;aradhanam&quot; (puja) to Vishnu&#x27;s idol (deity in a reclining posture). He is regarded to have granted the idol to Vibhishana (the brother of Ravana of the Hindu epic Ramayana) to take back with him to Lanka. Rama informed him that he could not set the idol upon the earth; if he did so, the idol would become bound upon the site. While travelling towards Lanka, he came upon the banks of the river Kaveri. He placed the idol on the banks while an utsavam was in progress. When the utsavam got over, the idol refused to move, according to some accounts because Vishnu grew fond of Srirangam. When Vibhishana requested the deity to come along with him, Vishnu refused, but promised to bless Vibhishana by always facing the south (the direction of Lanka, home to Vibhishana). It is due this reason the idol of the deity (in a reclining posture) is believed to face the south. The Chola kings Dharmavarcholan and Killivalavan developed the shrine into the present size of the temple, with the contributions of Tirumangai Alvar. They built the basic foundations and main buildings.

After the rise of the Vijayanagara Empire, the emperor Krishnadevaraya offered his patronage to the city, treating it on par with Tirupati and bequeathing plenty of treasures, jewels and lands to the Srirangam temple. During his period the Srirangam temple was restructured, and many plans were executed for its growth and welfare of the people.

==Geography==
The Kaveri River diverges at the Upper Anaicut, a dam at the island&#x27;s westernmost point. The Kollidam River, the first and largest distributary of the Kaveri, flows to the north of the Srirangam Island, while the continuation of the Kaveri flows to the island&#x27;s south. While the Kollidam continues flowing east past the island unimpeded, the Grand Anaicut dams the Kaveri at the island&#x27;s eastern end, splitting the river into four streams. One stream flows northeast for a short distance, joining the Kollidam and cutting off Srirangam Island on its eastern end. The island is in length and wide. The town of Srirangam, a prominent Hindu Vaishnavite pilgrimage centre, is located at the centre of this island. Most of the island forms part of the Srirangam zone of the Tiruchirappalli Municipal Corporation and includes the suburbs of Srirangam, Thiruvanaikaval, Srinivasa Nagar and Gitapuram.

<text>Peckham Library is a library and community building situated in Peckham in south-east London, United Kingdom. It was designed by Alsop and Störmer, engineered by AKT II and won the Stirling Prize for Architecture in 2000.

It is a striking building best imagined as an inverted capital letter &#x27;L&#x27;, with the upper part supported by thin steel pillars set at apparently random angles. The exterior is clad with pre-patinated copper.

The Stirling Prize judges were impressed with the building&#x27;s approach. Alsop has taken the plan footprint of a conventional library and elevated it to create a public space beneath the building and to remove the quiet reading space from street level noise. The remaining, supporting buildings on the ground and 1st floors house the information and media centre. The building has five floors in total, with the library service taking up the fourth floor.

The library opened to the public on 8 March 2000, with an official opening by Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Chris Smith, on 15 May 2000.

The building attracted 500,000 visitors in its first year of opening in the wake of its receipt of the prize. This dropped to approximately 420,000 for 2006.

, a student service centre building at the RWTH Aachen in Germany was built in 2006, which has been compared to Peckham Library with a similar L design.

<text>Meze (also spelled mezze or mezé) (, ) is a selection of small dishes served as appetizers in eastern Mediterranean cuisines. It is similar to Spanish tapas and Italian antipasti. A &quot;meze&quot; may be served as a part of a multi-course meal or form a meal in itself. &quot;Meze&quot; are often served with spirits such as &quot;arak, rakia, raki, oghi, ouzo,&quot; or &quot;grappa&quot; at meyhane and ouzeri or at regular restaurants.
The word meze, used in all the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire, borrowed from Turkish meze meaning &#x27;appetizer&#x27;, which in turn had borrowed it from the Persian maze or maza (مَزه) meaning &#x27;taste&#x27; or &#x27;relish&#x27;.

==Common dishes==


In Turkey, &quot;meze&quot; often consist of &quot;beyaz peynir&quot; &#x27;white cheese&#x27;, &quot;kavun&quot; (sliced ripe melon), &quot;acılı ezme&quot; (hot pepper paste often with walnuts), &quot;haydari&quot; (thick strained yogurt with herbs), &quot;patlıcan salatası&quot; (cold eggplant salad), &quot;beyin salatası&quot; (brain salad), &quot;kalamar tava&quot; (fried calamari), midye dolma and &quot;midye tava&quot; (stuffed or fried mussels), enginar (artichokes), &quot;cacık&quot; (yogurt with cucumber and garlic), &quot;pilaki&quot; (foods cooked in a special sauce), &quot;dolma&quot; or &quot;sarma&quot; (rice-stuffed vine leaves or other stuffed vegetables, such as bell peppers), &quot;Arnavut ciğeri&quot; (a liver dish, served cold), octopus salad, and &quot;çiğ köfte&quot; (raw meatballs with bulgur). A selection of mezes can be served as appetizers in a multi-course dinner, or as snacks accompanying drinks such as rakı.

In Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria and the rest of the Balkans, &quot;mezé&quot;, &quot;mezés&quot; or &quot;mezédhes&quot; (plural) are small dishes, hot or cold, spicy or savory. Seafood dishes such as grilled octopus may be included, along with salads, sliced hard-boiled eggs, garlic bread, kalamata olives, fava spread, fried vegetables, &quot;melitzanosalata&quot; (eggplant salad), &quot;taramosalata&quot;, fried or grilled cheeses called &quot;saganaki&quot;, and sheep, goat, or cow cheeses. 

Popular &quot;meze&quot; dishes include the following:

Other &quot;meze&quot; dishes include cheeses (such as &quot;halloumi&quot;, &quot;labneh&quot;, &quot;tulum&quot;, or &quot;shanklish&quot;) or meat dishes (like &quot;afelia&quot;, &quot;lountza&quot;, or &quot;pastirma&quot;), fish (like fried whitebait, calamari).

In Greece, meze is commonly served as a plate of snacks to accompany drinks such as ouzo and tsipouro.

In Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Cyprus, and Israel, &quot;meze&quot; is often a meal in its own right. There are vegetarian, meat or fish &quot;mezes&quot;. Groups of dishes arrive at the table about four or five at a time (usually between five and ten groups). There is a set pattern to the dishes: typically olives, tahini, salad, and yogurt will be followed by dishes with vegetables and eggs, then small meat or fish dishes alongside special accompaniments, and finally more substantial dishes such as whole fish or meat stews and grills. Establishments will offer their own specialties, but the pattern remains the same. Naturally the dishes served will reflect the seasons. For example, in late autumn, snails will be prominent. As so much food is offered, it is not expected that every dish be finished, but rather shared at will and served at ease. Arak and Beer are often drank with mezze, especially if meats are ordered.

In the Balkans, &quot;meze&quot; is very similar to an Italian antipasto in that cured cold-cuts, cheese and salads are dominant and cooked foods are not included. In Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Montenegro it includes hard or creamy cheeses, &quot;kajmak&quot; (clotted cream) or &quot;smetana&quot; cream, salami, ham and other forms of &quot;suho/suvo meso&quot; (cured pork or beef), &quot;kulen&quot; (paprika flavoured, cured sausage), cured bacon, &quot;ajvar&quot;, and various savory pastries. For Muslims, &quot;meze&quot; replaces pork products with &quot;sudžuk&quot; (dry, spicy sausage) and the &quot;pastirma&quot;-like cured beef &quot;suho meso&quot;. In southern Croatia, Herzegovina, and Montenegro, cured meat such as &quot;pršut&quot; and &quot;panceta&quot; and regional products like olives are common. Albanian-style &quot;meze&quot; platters typically include &quot;prosciutto&quot; ham, salami, and brined cheese, accompanied with roasted bell peppers (&quot;capsicum&quot;) or green olives marinated in olive oil with garlic. In Bulgaria, popular &quot;mezes&quot; are &quot;lukanka&quot; (a spicy sausage), &quot;soujouk&quot; (a dry and spicy sausage) and &quot;sirene&quot; (a white brine cheese). The Bulgarian-made &quot;shopska&quot; salad is also a very popular &quot;meze&quot;. It is made with tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, peppers, and &quot;sirene&quot;. &quot;Ajvar&quot; and &quot;pindjur&quot; are popular &quot;mezes&quot; in North Macedonia. In Romania, &quot;mezelic&quot; means a quick appetizer and includes &quot;zacuscă&quot;, cheeses, and salamis, often accompanied by &quot;tuică&quot;.

<text>The Cathedral Church of St Peter and St Wilfrid, commonly known as Ripon Cathedral, and until 1836 known as Ripon Minster, is a cathedral in Ripon, North Yorkshire, England. Founded as a monastery by monks of the Irish tradition in the 660s, it was refounded as a Benedictine monastery by St Wilfrid in 672. The church became collegiate in the tenth century, and acted as a mother church within the large Diocese of York for the remainder of the Middle Ages. The present church is the fourth, and was built between the 13th and 16th centuries. In 1836 the church became the cathedral for the Diocese of Ripon. In 2014 the Diocese was incorporated into the new Diocese of Leeds, and the church became one of three co-equal cathedrals of the Bishop of Leeds.

The cathedral is notable architecturally for its gothic west front in the Early English style, considered one of the best of its type, as well as the Geometric east window. The seventh-century crypt of Wilfrid&#x27;s church is a significant example of early Christian architecture in England. The cathedral has Grade I listed building status.

==Background==
There has been a stone church on the site since 672, when Saint Wilfrid replaced the previous timber church of the monastery at Ripon (a daughter house of Saint Aidan&#x27;s monastery at Melrose) with one in the Roman style. This was one of the earliest stone buildings erected in the Kingdom of Northumbria. The crypt dates from this period.

==History==

Today&#x27;s church is the fourth to have stood on this site. Saint Wilfrid brought stonemasons, plasterers and glaziers from France and Italy to build his great basilica in AD 672. A contemporary account by Stephen of Ripon tells us:

Saint Wilfrid was buried in this church near the high altar. Devastated by the English king Eadred in AD 948 as a warning to the Archbishop of York, only the crypt of Wilfrid&#x27;s church survived but today this tiny 7th-century chapel rests complete beneath the later grandeur of Archbishop Roger de Pont l’Evêque&#x27;s 12th century minster. A second minster soon arose at Ripon, but it too perished – this time in 1069 at the hands of William the Conqueror. Thomas of Bayeux, first Norman Archbishop of York, then instigated the construction of a third church, traces of which were incorporated into the later chapter house of Roger&#x27;s minster.

The Early English west front was added in 1220, its twin towers originally crowned with wooden spires and lead. The east window was built as part of a reconstruction of the choir between 1286–8 and 1330, and was described by architecture critic Pevsner as a &#x27;splendid&#x27; example of the series of large Decorated Gothic windows constructed in Northern England. Major rebuilding had to be postponed due to the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses but resumed after the accession of Henry VII and the restoration of peace in 1485. The crossing tower was rebuilt after it collapsed in an earthquake in 1450 but was never completed. Between 1501 and 1522 the nave walls were raised higher and the aisles added. The church&#x27;s thirty-four misericords were carved between 1489 and 1494. The same (Ripon) school of carvers also carved the misericords at Beverley Minster and Manchester Cathedral. But in 1547, before this work was finished, Edward VI dissolved Ripon&#x27;s college of canons. All revenues were appropriated by the Crown and the tower never received its last Perpendicular arches. It was not until 1604 that James I issued his Charter of Restoration.

During the Civil War, much of the stained glass was smashed and some of the statues were destroyed.

==Cathedral status==
The minster finally became a cathedral (the church where the Bishop has his cathedra or throne) in 1836, the focal point of the newly created Anglican Diocese of Ripon – the first to be established since the Reformation.

==Dean and chapter==
As of 30 December 2020:
*Dean – John Dobson (since 14 June 2014 installation)
*Canon Precentor – Michael Gisbourne (since 16 September 2018 installation)
*Canon Educator (i.e. Canon Chancellor) – Barry Pyke (since 11 September 2016 installation; previously called &quot;Canon for Rural Engagement and Education&quot;)
*Canon Pastor – Ailsa Newby (since June 2017; Newby is also The Lady Newby by her marriage to the Liberal politician Lord Newby)

==Music==

The current director of music is Dr Ronny Krippner, with Tim Harper as assistant director of music.

===Organ===
The cathedral has a fine organ by Harrison and Harrison, which is a rebuild of the original Lewis instrument dating from 1878. The organ is on the screen and has casework by Gilbert Scott. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. The organ last underwent a major refurbishment in 2013. These works included a thorough cleaning and repair of all pipe work.

===Organists===
In 1447, the organ at Ripon Cathedral was played by a priest, Thomas Litster. Notable organists have included composers Charles Harry Moody and Ronald Edward Perrin.

===Bells===

A ring of 12 bells with an additional &#x27;flat sixth&#x27; bell is hung in the south-west tower. A diatonic ring of ten bells was cast in 1932, and three additional bells were installed in 2008 with two new trebles being added to give a diatonic ring of twelve, and an additional &#x27;flat sixth&#x27; bell to give a light ring of eight.

<text>Hittite (, or ), also known as Nesite (Nešite/Neshite, Nessite), is an extinct Indo-European language that was spoken by the Hittites, a people of Bronze Age Anatolia who created an empire centred on Hattusa, as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia. The language, now long extinct, is attested in cuneiform, in records dating from the 17th (Anitta text) to the 13th centuries BC, with isolated Hittite loanwords and numerous personal names appearing in an Old Assyrian context from as early as the 20th century BC, making it the earliest attested use of the Indo-European languages.

By the Late Bronze Age, Hittite had started losing ground to its close relative Luwian. It appears that Luwian was the most widely spoken language in the Hittite capital, Hattusa, in the 13th century BC. After the collapse of the Hittite New Kingdom during the more general Late Bronze Age collapse, Luwian emerged in the Early Iron Age as the main language of the so-called Syro-Hittite states, in southwestern Anatolia and northern Syria.

==Name==
&quot;Hittite&quot; is the modern scholarly name for the language, based on the identification of the Hatti (&quot;Ḫatti&quot;) kingdom with the Biblical Hittites ( ), although that name appears to have been applied incorrectly: The term &quot;Hattian&quot; refers to the indigenous people who preceded the Hittites, speaking a non-Indo-European Hattic language.

In multilingual texts found in Hittite locations, passages written in Hittite are preceded by the adverb (or , ), &quot;in the [speech] of Neša (Kaneš)&quot;, an important city during the early stages of the Hittite Old Kingdom. In one case, the label is &quot;Kanisumnili&quot;, &quot;in the [speech] of the people of Kaneš&quot;.

Although the Hittite New Kingdom had people from many diverse ethnic and linguistic backgrounds, the Hittite language was used in most secular written texts. In spite of various arguments over the appropriateness of the term, &quot;Hittite&quot; remains the most current term because of convention and the strength of association with the Biblical Hittites. The endonymic term , and its Anglicized variants (&quot;Nesite&quot;, &quot;Nessite&quot;, &quot;Neshite&quot;), have never caught on.

==Classification==
Hittite is one of the Anatolian languages and is known from cuneiform tablets and inscriptions that were erected by the Hittite kings. The script formerly known as &quot;Hieroglyphic Hittite&quot; is now termed Hieroglyphic Luwian. The Anatolian branch also includes Cuneiform Luwian, Hieroglyphic Luwian, Palaic, Lycian, Milyan, Lydian, Carian, Pisidian, Sidetic and Isaurian.

Unlike most other Indo-European languages, Hittite does not distinguish between masculine and feminine grammatical gender, and it lacks subjunctive and optative moods as well as aspect. Various hypotheses have been formulated to explain these differences.

Some linguists, most notably Edgar H. Sturtevant and Warren Cowgill, have argued that Hittite should be classified as a sister language to Proto-Indo-European, rather than as a daughter language. Their Indo-Hittite hypothesis is that the parent language (Indo-Hittite) lacked the features that are absent in Hittite as well, and that Proto-Indo-European later innovated them.

Other linguists, however, prefer the &quot;Schwund&quot; (&quot;loss&quot;) Hypothesis in which Hittite (or Anatolian) came from Proto-Indo-European, with its full range of features, but the features became simplified in Hittite.

According to Craig Melchert, the current tendency (as of 2012) is to suppose that Proto-Indo-European evolved and that the &quot;prehistoric speakers&quot; of Anatolian became isolated &quot;from the rest of the PIE speech community, so as not to share in some common innovations&quot;. Hittite and the other Anatolian languages split off from Proto-Indo-European at an early stage. Hittite thus preserved archaisms that would be lost in the other Indo-European languages.

Hittite has many loanwords, particularly religious vocabulary from the non-Indo-European Hurrian and Hattic languages. The latter was the language of the Hattians, the local inhabitants of the land of Hatti before they were absorbed or displaced by the Hittites. Sacred and magical texts from Hattusa were often written in Hattic, Hurrian and Luwian even after Hittite had become the norm for other writings.

== History ==
The Hittite language has traditionally been stratified into Old Hittite (OH), Middle Hittite (MH) and New Hittite or Neo-Hittite (NH, not to be confused with the polysemic use of &quot;Neo-Hittite&quot; label as a designation for the later period, which is actually post-Hittite), corresponding to the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms of the Hittite history (–1500 BC, 1500–1430 BC and 1430–1180 BC, respectively). The stages are differentiated on both linguistic and paleographic grounds.

Hittitologist Alwin Kloekhorst (2019) recognizes two dialectal variants of Hittite: one he calls &quot;Kanišite Hittite&quot;, and a second he named &quot;Ḫattuša Hittite&quot; (or Hittite proper). The first is attested in clay tablets from Kaniš/Neša (Kültepe), and is dated earlier than the findings from Ḫattuša.

==Script==

Hittite was written in an adapted form of Peripheral Akkadian cuneiform orthography from Northern Syria. The predominantly syllabic nature of the script makes it difficult to ascertain the precise phonetic qualities of some of the Hittite sound inventory.

The syllabary distinguishes the following consonants (notably, the Akkadian &quot;s&quot; series is dropped),
:&quot;b, d, g, ḫ, k, l, m, n, p, r, š, t, z&quot;, combined with the vowels &quot;a, e, i, u&quot;. Additionally, &quot;ya&quot; (= I.A : ), &quot;wa&quot; (= PI : ) and &quot;wi&quot; (= &quot;wi5&quot; = GEŠTIN : ) signs are introduced.

The Akkadian unvoiced/voiced series (k/g, p/b, t/d) do not express the voiced/unvoiced contrast in writing, but double spellings in intervocalic positions represent voiceless consonants in Indo-European (Sturtevant&#x27;s law).

==Phonology==

The limitations of the syllabic script in helping to determine the nature of Hittite phonology have been more or less overcome by means of comparative etymology and an examination of Hittite spelling conventions. Accordingly, scholars have surmised that Hittite possessed the following phonemes:

===Vowels===
*Long vowels appear as alternates to their corresponding short vowels when they are so conditioned by the accent.
*Phonemically distinct long vowels occur infrequently.

===Consonants===
===Plosives===
Hittite had two series of consonants, one which was written always geminate in the original script, and another that was always simple. In cuneiform, all consonant sounds except for glides could be geminate. It has long been noticed that the geminate series of plosives is the one descending from Proto-Indo-European voiceless stops, and the simple plosives come from both voiced and voiced aspirate stops, which is often referred as Sturtevant&#x27;s law. Because of the typological implications of Sturtevant&#x27;s law, the distinction between the two series is commonly regarded as one of voice. However, there is no agreement over the subject among scholars since some view the series as if they were differenced by length, which a literal interpretation of the cuneiform orthography would suggest.

Supporters of a length distinction usually point to the fact that Akkadian, the language from which the Hittites borrowed the cuneiform script, had voicing, but Hittite scribes used voiced and voiceless signs interchangeably. Alwin Kloekhorst also argues that the absence of assimilatory voicing is also evidence for a length distinction. He points out that the word &quot;&quot;e-ku-ud-du&quot; – [ɛ́kʷːtu]&quot; does not show any voice assimilation. However, if the distinction were one of voice, agreement between the stops should be expected since the velar and the alveolar plosives are known to be adjacent since that word&#x27;s &quot;u&quot; represents not a vowel but labialization.

===Laryngeals===
Hittite preserves some very archaic features lost in other Indo-European languages. For example, Hittite has retained two of the three laryngeals ( and word-initially). Those sounds, whose existence had been hypothesized in 1879 by Ferdinand de Saussure, on the basis of vowel quality in other Indo-European languages, were not preserved as separate sounds in any attested Indo-European language until the discovery of Hittite. In Hittite, the phoneme is written as &quot;ḫ&quot;. In that respect, Hittite is unlike any other attested Indo-European language and so the discovery of laryngeals in Hittite was a remarkable confirmation of Saussure&#x27;s hypothesis.

Both the preservation of the laryngeals and the lack of evidence that Hittite shared certain grammatical features in the other early Indo-European languages have led some philologists to believe that the Anatolian languages split from the rest of Proto-Indo-European much earlier than the other divisions of the proto-language. See #Classification above for more details.

==Morphology==

Hittite is the oldest attested Indo-European language, yet it lacks several grammatical features that are exhibited by other early-attested Indo-European languages such as Vedic, Classical Latin, Ancient Greek, Old Persian and Old Avestan. Notably, Hittite did not have a masculine–feminine gender system. Instead, it had a rudimentary noun-class system that was based on an older animate–inanimate opposition.

===Nouns===
Hittite inflects for nine cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative-locative, ablative, ergative, allative, and instrumental; two numbers: singular, and plural; and two animacy classes: animate (common), and inanimate (neuter). Adjectives and pronouns agree with nouns for animacy, number, and case.

The distinction in animacy is rudimentary and generally occurs in the nominative case, and the same noun is sometimes attested in both animacy classes. There is a trend towards distinguishing fewer cases in the plural than in the singular. The ergative case is used when an inanimate noun is the subject of a transitive verb. Early Hittite texts have a vocative case for a few nouns with &quot;-u&quot;, but it ceased to be productive by the time of the earliest discovered sources and was subsumed by the nominative in most documents. The allative was subsumed in the later stages of the language by the dative-locative. An archaic genitive plural &quot;-an&quot; is found irregularly in earlier texts, as is an instrumental plural in &quot;-it&quot;. A few nouns also form a distinct locative, which had no case ending at all.

The examples of &quot;pišna-&quot; (&quot;man&quot;) for animate and &quot;pēda-&quot; (&quot;place&quot;) for inanimate are used here to show the Hittite noun declension&#x27;s most basic form:

===Verbs===
The verbal morphology is less complicated than for other early-attested Indo-European languages like Ancient Greek and Vedic. Hittite verbs inflect according to two general conjugations (&quot;mi&quot;-conjugation and &quot;hi&quot;-conjugation), two voices (active and medio-passive), two moods (indicative mood and imperative), two aspects (perfective and imperfective), and two tenses (present and preterite). Verbs have two infinitive forms, a verbal noun, a supine, and a participle. Rose (2006) lists 132 &quot;hi&quot; verbs and interprets the &quot;hi&quot;/&quot;mi&quot; oppositions as vestiges of a system of grammatical voice (&quot;centripetal voice&quot; vs. &quot;centrifugal voice&quot;).

==Syntax==
Hittite is a head-final language: it has subject-object-verb word order, a split ergative alignment, and is a synthetic language; adpositions follow their complement, adjectives and genitives precede the nouns that they modify, adverbs precede verbs, and subordinate clauses precede main clauses.

Hittite syntax shows one noteworthy feature that is typical of Anatolian languages: commonly, the beginning of a sentence or clause is composed of either a sentence-connecting particle or otherwise a fronted or topicalized form, and a &quot;chain&quot; of fixed-order clitics is then appended.

==Decipherment==

The first substantive claim as to the affiliation of Hittite was made by Jørgen Alexander Knudtzon in 1902, in a book devoted to two letters between the king of Egypt and a Hittite ruler, found at El-Amarna, Egypt. Knudtzon argued that Hittite was Indo-European, largely because of its morphology. Although he had no bilingual texts, he was able to provide a partial interpretation of the two letters because of the formulaic nature of the diplomatic correspondence of the period.

Knudtzon was definitively shown to have been correct when many tablets written in the familiar Akkadian cuneiform script but in an unknown language were discovered by Hugo Winckler in what is now the village of Boğazköy, Turkey, which was the former site of Hattusa, the capital of the Hittite state. Based on a study of this extensive material, Bedřich Hrozný succeeded in analyzing the language. He presented his argument that the language is Indo-European in a paper published in 1915 (Hrozný 1915), which was soon followed by a grammar of the language (Hrozný 1917). Hrozný&#x27;s argument for the Indo-European affiliation of Hittite was thoroughly modern although poorly substantiated. He focused on the striking similarities in idiosyncratic aspects of the morphology that are unlikely to occur independently by chance or to be borrowed. They included the &quot;r&quot;/&quot;n&quot; alternation in some noun stems (the heteroclitics) and vocalic ablaut, which are both seen in the alternation in the word for &quot;water&quot; between the nominative singular, &quot;wadar&quot;, and the genitive singular, &quot;wedenas&quot;. He also presented a set of regular sound correspondences. After a brief initial delay because of disruption during the First World War, Hrozný&#x27;s decipherment, tentative grammatical analysis and demonstration of the Indo-European affiliation of Hittite were rapidly accepted and more broadly substantiated by contemporary scholars such as Edgar H. Sturtevant, who authored the first scientifically acceptable Hittite grammar with a chrestomathy and a glossary. The most up-to-date grammar of the Hittite language is currently Hoffner and Melchert (2008).

==Corpus==

More than 30,000 tablets or fragments have been excavated from the royal archives of the capital of the Hittite Kingdom Hattusa, close to the modern town of Boğazkale or Boğazköy. While Hattusa has yielded the majority of tablets, other sites where they have been found include: Maşat Höyük, Ortaköy, Kuşaklı or Kayalıpınar in Turkey, Alalakh, Ougarit and Emar in Syria, Amarna in Egypt.

The tablets are mostly conserved in the Turkish museums of Ankara, Istanbul, Boğazkale and Çorum (Ortaköy) as well as in international museums such as the Pergamonmuseum in Berlin, the British Museum in London and the Musée du Louvre in Paris.
===The transliteration and translation of the proclamation of Anitta===
This text has been found in three versions, the earliest of which is considered the oldest known of all Hittite language texts, dated from between the end of the 17th century BCE and the middle of the 16th century BCE.

<doc id="351026" wikidata="Q643919" url="?curid=351026" title="Torfaen">
<text>Torfaen (; ) is a county borough in the south-east of Wales. Torfaen is bordered by the county of Monmouthshire to the east, the city of Newport to the south, and the county boroughs of Caerphilly and Blaenau Gwent to the south-west and north-west. It is within the boundaries of the historic county of Monmouthshire, and between 1974 and 1996 was a district of Gwent, until it was reconstituted as a principal area in 1996.

==Toponymy==
Torfaen (meaning &quot;breaker of stones&quot;) is an old name for the river – today called Afon Lwyd (&quot;grey river&quot;) – which flows through the county borough from its source north of Blaenavon southward through Abersychan, Pontypool, and Cwmbran. The last three towns mentioned are a contiguous urban area.

==History==
The borough was formed in 1974 as a local government district of Gwent. It covered the whole area of three former districts and two parishes from another two districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Blaenavon Urban District
*Cwmbran Urban District
*Henllys parish from Magor and St Mellons Rural District
*Llanfrechfa Lower parish from Pontypool Rural District
*Pontypool Urban District
All the constituent parts of Torfaen had previously been in the administrative county of Monmouthshire prior to the reforms. Gwent County Council provided county-level services to the new borough.

Torfaen was reconstituted in 1996 as a county borough, taking over the county-level functions from the abolished Gwent County Council. The area is now governed by Torfaen County Borough Council, which is a principal council.

Torfaen has its own museum Torfaen Museum, in Pontypool Park, Pontypool.

==Area characteristics==
The area has a population of around 91,000. Much of the southern part of the county borough around Cwmbran is extensively urban. The north of the county borough is greener and retains extensive areas of countryside, especially on the route to Blaenavon.

The administrative centre is Pontypool in the centre of the county borough. Most of the administration of Torfaen County Borough Council is conducted from Pontypool Civic Centre.

==Local landmarks==
The highest point of the county is Coity Mountain.

===Pontypool Indoor Market===
A market hall of 1893-4, built when the existing facility became too small and needed replacing due to the greatly increased local population. The previous Vegetable Market (1875) which stood on the same site was demolished, but the first hall built in 1730 still survives in Commercial Street. The Market was designed by Robert Williams and D J Loughor (who was probably the engineer). This building is the only physical reminder of the work of the Pontypool Local Board who were replaced by the Pontypool Urban District Council following the 1894 Local Government Act.

Exterior
A large iron framed market hall with two full elevations and three secondary entrances through other street frontages, eg. Jubilee Building, Crane Street. Built of grey narrow coursed rock faced pennant limestone with some larger stones, and with yellow Ebbw Vale brick dressings and a Welsh slate roof. Single storey street elevations with windows onto secondary aisles which surround the main aisled hall. The Market Street elevation has a central doorway with four centred Tudor arch head. This has part glazed wooden doors with pilasters rising to a corbel frieze and a date panel 1893, and a parapet over with raised battlement type features at either end. This door is flanked on either side by four three-light windows with yellow brick frames and mullions. These are all in line, but the plinth below with yellow brick coping is stepped down the street. Additional doors flank these, again with pilasters but not rising to a parapet; then another three light window at the north end but only a single light one at the south corner. The end elevation has first a single light, then a two-light with king mullion, then five three-light windows, the most northerly one with a roundel in a gable above. The roofs behind these walls can be seen stepped up in three heights over the two aisles and the main nave. The nave roof has timber gable windows and glazing along the length of the roof on both slopes.
Crane Street entrance: This has another Tudor doorway as above, but flanked by one over one windows in plain heads. Above the entrance is a crow-stepped gable with block at apex and a three light window with stepped head above the door. Gable has date 1894 and inscription PLB (Pontypool Local Board).
Commercial Street entrance has another Tudor style doorway set into the ground floor of an early C19 terrace on the south west side of Commercial Street. Only the doorway and the dateplaque 1894 above it are late C19.

Interior
The market has a central nave supported on plain iron columns, and this has aisles on either side and then a secondary aisle which surrounds most of the structure. There are additional passageways giving access to the entrances in Commercial Street and in Crane Street. The columns carry light curved iron members, and a roof structure of light iron with timber rafters and sarking. The nave roof has bands of glazing running the full length on either side of the ridge. The interior appears to be very little altered. The stalls are mostly modern.

===Pontypool Park===

*Pontypool Park is the name given to the former principal residence of Pontypool (now a secondary school) and the park that surrounds it. The park contains Pontypool Leisure Centre and sports facilities and is the home of Pontypool RFC. The park includes a folly, shell grotto and ornamental ponds. Much of the area is given to woodland but there is extensive open grassland. The American Gardens were opened to the public in 2008, after being closed to visitors for many years, and a restoration project is under way. Torfaen County Borough Council is currently mapping all the trees from the park to remove and then replant those dying and diseased.

===Cwmbran Centre===

*Cwmbran Centre is advertised as the second largest under-cover shopping centre in Wales. The centre includes many familiar high-street stores.

===Blaenavon===

*The former coal-mining and iron-working town of Blaenavon in the northern part of the county borough is now a recognised UNESCO World Heritage Site.
== Media ==
Torfaen has its own community radio station, Vitalize Radio, which is run on a voluntary basis in Pontypool to serve the community. Additionally, Cwmbran has its own community-focused radio station: Able Radio is a volunteer-run radio station which supports adults with autism and learning disabilities, and claims to be &quot;the first Radio Station run by people with Learning Disabilities and Autism in the world&quot;. In recent years, Able Radio station has increased the scope of their activities, including television productions and their gardening project and associated produce shop, SustainAble. There is also the Cwmbran and District Amateur Radio Society, which focuses on ham radio.

There are also various local community news services, most notably Cwmbran Life and Inside Torfaen. The South Wales Argus serves as the main newspaper.

==Politics==
Torfaen is historically a safe Labour Party seat. At present the MP is Nick Thomas-Symonds. Constituents in Croesyceiliog North, Croesyceiliog South, Llanyrafon North and Llanyrafon South wards are served by the Monmouth MP, Conservative David Davies. Torfaen is also a Senedd constituency, presided over by Labour MS, Lynne Neagle.

Torfaen Council has historically been a Labour-controlled authority, however the 2008 Local Elections saw Labour fail to win enough seats to hold a majority, resulting in a coalition with Plaid Cymru and Independent Councillors.

In the 2022 Local Elections, Labour regained majority control of Torfaen County Borough Council, winning 30 out of a possible 40 seats.

The main council offices for ‘Torfaen County Borough Council’ are situated in The Civic Centre, Pontypool.

In 2012 Torfaen County Borough Council was criticised for keeping 2,400 laptop computers, originally intended to be used by secondary school pupils and teachers, unused for at least a year &quot;because it couldn&#x27;t figure out what to do&quot; with the equipment, which originally cost over a million pounds.

<doc id="351029" wikidata="Q3396731" url="?curid=351029" title="Cardiff Bay">
<text>Cardiff Bay (; colloquially &quot;The Bay&quot;) is an area and freshwater lake in Cardiff, Wales. The site of a former tidal bay and estuary, it is the river mouth of the River Taff and Ely. The body of water was converted into a lake as part of a pre-devolution UK Government regeneration project, involving the damming of the rivers by the Cardiff Bay Barrage in 1999. The barrage impounds the rivers from the Severn Estuary, providing flood defence and the creation of a permanent non-tidal high water lake with limited access to the sea, serving as a core feature of the redevelopment of the area in the 1990s. 

Surrounding the lake is a area of redeveloped former derelict docklands which shares its name. The area is situated between Cardiff city centre and Penarth, in the communities of Butetown and Grangetown. Its waterfront is home to notable attractions, in particular regarding Welsh politics and devolved institutions, such as the Senedd building (housing the Senedd, the Welsh Parliament), Pierhead Building and Tŷ Hywel; and cultural attractions including the Wales Millennium Centre and Norwegian Church. The presence of devolved institutions in Cardiff Bay has led to its name&#x27;s use as a metonym for devolved Welsh politics. According to Cardiff Council, the creation of Cardiff Bay is regarded as one of the most successful regeneration projects in the United Kingdom. The bay was formerly tidal, with access to the sea limited to a couple of hours each side of high water but now provides 24-hour access through three locks.

The Cardiff Bay Wetlands Reserve is situated along the northern edge of the lake, on the site of a former salt marsh.

==History==

On 15 June 1910 the Terra Nova Expedition left the Roath Basin in Cardiff&#x27;s docklands and headed south to Antarctica. On board were Captain Robert Falcon Scott and members of his British Antarctic Expedition, who aimed to be the first to reach the South Pole. Scott&#x27;s entire party of five died on the return journey from the pole.

Cardiff Bay played a major part in Cardiff’s development by being the means of exporting coal from the South Wales Valleys to the rest of the world, helping to power the industrial age. The coal mining industry helped fund the building of Cardiff into the capital city of Wales and helped the Third Marquis of Bute, who owned the docks, become the richest man in the world at the time.

As Cardiff exports grew, so did its population; dockworkers and sailors from across the world settled in neighbourhoods close to the docks, known as Tiger Bay, and communities from up to 50 different nationalities, including Norwegian, Somali, Yemeni, Greek, Spanish, Italian, Caribbean and Irish helped create the unique multicultural character of the area.

After the Second World War most of the industry closed down and the area became a neglected part of Cardiff, a wasteland of derelict docks and mudflats. Social exclusion of the area&#x27;s inhabitants rose and Cardiff Bay had above average levels of unemployment. But, in 1999, new life was injected into the area by the building of the Cardiff Bay Barrage, one of the most controversial building projects of the day but also one of the most successful.

==Development==

The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation (CBDC) was created in 1987 to stimulate the redevelopment of 1,100 hectares (2,700 acres) of derelict land. The Development Corporation aimed to attract private capital by spending public money to improve the area. Despite opposition by environmentalists and wildlife organisations, the mudflats at the mouths of the River Taff and River Ely were inundated, with loss of habitat for wading birds. The Barrage has created several new habitats for freshwater species with the wetlands to the south of the Hamadryad Park.

When the Development Corporation was wound up in on 31 March 2000, it had achieved many of its objectives. The whole area was unrecognisable from ten years before. Much private land was now open to the public, particularly around the inner harbour and the north side of Roath basin. Work is progressing to complete a 13 kilometre walkway around the bay. In addition, the development has enabled land in the city centre to be redeveloped for higher-value uses.

Connecting the bay area to the centre of Cardiff was a primary goal when plans to develop the docklands were first mooted. Original plans included a grand boulevard (similar to where Lloyd George Avenue is located now) with high-density commercial and residential units straddling both sides. This would have created significant demand for quality public transport provisions facilitating connections to the new Bay area but public transport was often of poor quality and, but there are now much-improved connections through the Cardiff Bus BayCar service and rail service from Cardiff Queen Street to Cardiff Bay railway station.

On 30 January 2013 the planning consultant, Adrian Jones, stated that Cardiff Bay was a contender for the &quot;worst example of waterside regeneration in Britain&quot;.

==Appearances in the media==

Cardiff Bay was used as the high-tech urban setting for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Boom Town&quot; and the show&#x27;s spinoff, &quot;Torchwood&quot;, whose makers deliberately avoided stereotypical portrayals of Wales in order to portray Cardiff as the modern urban centre it is today. In &quot;Torchwood&quot; series, there is a giant secret base underneath the bay, named &quot;The Hub&quot;, from where the Torchwood team works. There is also a lift from the hub into the plaza with a perception filter making anyone who stands on the spot &quot;not noticed&quot;. In the third series of Torchwood entitled &quot;Children Of Earth&quot;, Cardiff Bay was the centre of a bomb explosion, destroying the Torchwood Hub and Cardiff Bay. Roald Dahl Plass features prominently. In the episode &quot;Utopia&quot;, the Plass is home to a rift that the Doctor uses to refuel his TARDIS. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot; made use of office buildings in Cardiff Bay.

==Transport==

Cardiff Bay railway station is northeast of Mermaid Quay and is served by services to Cardiff Queen Street which run at a frequency of every 10 minutes, although the station is currently being upgraded with 2 extra platforms to allow new Metro services to Aberdare, Treherbert &amp; Merthyr Tydfil to operate. These metro services are expected to begin in 2025, with a core frequency of every 5 minutes. Alongside this, three new metro stations are expected to open in the area by 2027, serving the areas around Porth Teigr, Roath Lock, and the Senedd building.

<doc id="351034" wikidata="Q1146606" url="?curid=351034" title="Cutty Sark for Maritime Greenwich DLR station">
<text>Cutty Sark for Maritime Greenwich is a light metro station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in Greenwich, south-east London, so named for its proximity to the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; in the Maritime Greenwich district. It is the most central of the Greenwich DLR stations, being situated in Greenwich town centre. The station was designed, built and maintained by a private contractor from opening in 1999 to 2021, with the reliability of escalators at the station criticised by passengers.

==Location==
The northernmost of the Greenwich DLR stations, Cutty Sark for Maritime Greenwich is located in the Maritime Greenwich district of south-eastern London. Its name comes from the clipper ship named &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; which is housed to the north of the station. A number of well-known tourist attractions are in the surrounding area, including the National Maritime Museum, Royal Observatory, Greenwich Hospital, Greenwich foot tunnel, Trinity College of Music, and the Old Royal Naval College.

It is located close to the south bank of the River Thames and is below ground. Along with all other stations on the Lewisham extension, it is in Travelcard Zones 2 and 3, with passengers charged the lower of two possible fares.

==History==
In the mid 1990s, Cutty Sark station was proposed as part of a southern extension of the DLR to Lewisham. The station would serve the historic Greenwich town centre and nearby tourist attractions.

However, Cutty Sark was dropped from the project owing to its high construction costs (around £50 million) for the private consortium that would design, build, finance and maintain the extension. Following protests by Greenwich Council and promises of local funding, Cutty Sark was added back to the project in 1996 – with a mixed-use development to be built on top of the station by a developer working with English Partnerships. Construction started in October 1996, with a long, three-storey deep station box built in Greenwich town centre to house the future station, with the cutter heads of the tunnel boring machines also extracted at the site. 

Cutty Sark station opened on 3 December 1999 as part of the opening of the DLR extension to Lewisham. As with other stations on the extension, the station was designed by consultant W S Atkins. Since its opening, the extension has seen growth as a result of it connecting, along with two National Rail connections, the Canary Wharf financial centre with Greenwich.

The quality and reliability of the escalators at the station has been criticised, with passengers noting that escalators had been broken for years. When escalators are unavailable, passengers must use a 121-step staircase (or a small lift) to enter and leave the deep-level station. Between 1999 and 2021, the escalators were maintained by CGL Rail, the private contractor that built and maintained the Lewisham extension of the DLR. A local Labour councillor accused CGL Rail of handing the station back to TfL in a &quot;shameful state&quot;. In April 2024, TfL stated that they planned to repair and refurbish the escalators to improve their reliability. Local residents started a petition for full replacement of the escalators. In February 2025, TfL announced that the station would close temporarily to allow all four escalators to be replaced at a cost of £4 million. 

==Station layout==
One of only four completely underground stations on the DLR network, Cutty Sark station has an island platform with a track each side of it. This is similar to its cross-river sister station, Island Gardens. The platforms are below street level.

The need for increased capacity has posed issues for the station. While most on the network have had their platforms extended as part of Transport for London&#x27;s three-carriage capacity enhancement project, the two-car-long island platform at Cutty Sark cannot be lengthened due to cost (estimated at £30m) and risk of damage to the heritage site at street level. This is addressed by using selective door operation, allowing three-car trains to stop at the station by only having the doors near the centre of the train open in both end carriages; the first and last two sets of doors on each train do not open. Customers are warned of the need to move to the centre to leave the train by on-board announcements. A similar situation applies at Elverson Road.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Cutty Sark for Maritime Greenwich is:
* 12 tph to Bank
* 12 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 22 tph in each direction, with up to 8 tph during the peak hours running to and from instead of Bank.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 188 and 199, and night routes N1 and N199 serve the station.

<doc id="351035" wikidata="Q596885" url="?curid=351035" title="Blaenau Gwent">
<text>Blaenau Gwent (; ) is a county borough in the south-east of Wales. It borders the unitary authority areas of Monmouthshire and Torfaen to the east, Caerphilly to the west and Powys to the north. Its main towns are Abertillery, Brynmawr, Ebbw Vale and Tredegar. Its highest point is Coity Mountain at .

==Government==
The borough was formed in 1974 as a local government district of Gwent. It covered the whole area of five former districts and a single parish from a sixth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Abertillery Urban District
*Brynmawr Urban District
*Ebbw Vale Urban District
*Llanelly parish from Crickhowell Rural District
*Nantyglo and Blaina Urban District
*Tredegar Urban District
Brynmawr and Llanelly had been in the administrative county of Brecknockshire prior to the reforms, whilst the other areas had all been in the administrative county of Monmouthshire. Gwent County Council provided county-level services for the new borough.

The new borough was named Blaenau Gwent, meaning uplands of Gwent. The name had previously been an alternative name for the ancient parish of Aberystruth which had covered a large part of the area and had its parish church at Blaina.

Blaenau Gwent was reconstituted in 1996 as a county borough, taking over the county-level functions from the abolished Gwent County Council. At the same time Llanelly was transferred to the reconstituted Monmouthshire. The area is now governed by Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council, which is a principal council.

===Politics===
Blaenau Gwent hit the headlines at the 2005 UK General Election when an independent candidate, Peter Law, won the Westminster seat. He had resigned from the Labour Party after an internal party row following the retirement of incumbent MP Llew Smith, and defeated the official Labour candidate, Maggie Jones, by a margin of 9,121 votes. The seat had previously been held by Aneurin Bevan and Michael Foot, and was considered one of Labour&#x27;s safest. Law died on 25 April 2006 and in the by-election, a former supporter of his, Dai Davies won, running as an independent candidate. Peter Law&#x27;s widow, Trish Law, won his former Welsh Assembly seat, also running as an independent candidate. In 2007 she retained her seat. Dai Davies held the Westminster seat for the People&#x27;s Voice from 2006 – 2010 when he lost his seat in a huge majority to Labour&#x27;s Nick Smith of 10,516 votes. Alun Davies recaptured the seat for Labour at the Assembly elections in 2011 and then Labour won a landslide victory in the 2012 local elections taking 33 seats out of 42. Plaid Cymru nearly won the seat in the 2016 Assembly election, and Labour lost the council in the 2017 local elections.

From 2024, all of Blaenau Gwent would be in the Blaenau Gwent and Rhymney UK Parliament constituency.

== Archaeology ==
In February 2020, ancient cairns dated back to 4,500 year-old used to bury the leaders or chieftains of neolithic tribes people were revealed in the Cwmcelyn valley by the Aberystruth Archaeological Society.

&quot;It is thousands of years old undoubtedly, and came at a time when people first started settling here in Wales, farming and working the land by clearing the heavily wooded mountain sides of the Gwent valleys. The site is also found opposite the huts, so there could be some connection, though we think this burial may even be from a slightly earlier period than that&quot; said archaeologist Ian Fewings.

==Education==

== List of wards ==
==Other information==
In 2011 Blaenau Gwent had the highest level of severe child poverty in Wales, as revealed in statistical data published in a report by Save the Children.

<doc id="351036" wikidata="Q377164" url="?curid=351036" title="Staple (fastener)">
<text>A staple is a type of two-pronged fastener, usually metal, used for joining, gathering, or binding materials together. Large staples might be used with a hammer or staple gun for masonry, roofing, corrugated boxes and other heavy-duty uses. Smaller staples are used with a stapler to attach pieces of paper together; such staples are a more permanent and durable fastener for paper documents than the paper clip.
==Etymology==

The word &quot;staple&quot; originated in the late thirteenth Century, from Old English &quot;stapol&quot;, meaning &quot;post, pillar&quot;. The word&#x27;s first usage in the paper-fastening sense is attested from 1895.

==History==
In ancient times, the staple had several different functions.

Large metal staples dating from the 6th century BC have been found in the masonry works of the Persian empire (ancient Iran). For the construction of the Pasargadae and later Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht, these staples, which are known as &quot;dovetail&quot; or &quot;swallowtail&quot; staples, were used for tightening stones together.

The home stapling machine was developed by Henry Heyl in 1877 and registered under US Patent No. 195,603. Heyl&#x27;s companies, American Paper-Box Machine Company, Novelty Paper Box Company, and Standard Box Company, all of Philadelphia, manufactured machinery using staples in paper packaging and for saddle stitching.

==Advantages==

* Most kinds of staples are easier to produce than nails or screws.
* The crown of the staple can be used to bridge materials butted together.
* The crown can bridge a piece and fasten it without puncturing, with a leg on either side, e.g. fastening electrical cables to wood framing.
* The crown provides greater surface area than other comparable fasteners. This is generally more helpful with thinner materials.

==Disadvantages==
* Staples generally have lower holding power compared to nails or screws. This can make them unsuitable for heavy-duty applications where strong connections are required.
* Once a staple has been driven, it is difficult to remove without causing damage to the surrounding material. This contrasts with screws, which can often be removed and reused.
* When used to hold paper together, staples create a more or less permanent attachment. Removing them without damaging the paper can be challenging, whereas paperclips can be easily added and removed without harming the paper.
* While it&#x27;s possible to remove and reuse staples, doing so can be difficult and often renders the staple unusable for future use. Paperclips, in contrast, are designed to be reusable.

==Paper staples==

The term &quot;stapling&quot; is used for both fastening sheets of paper together with bent legs or fastening sheets of paper to something solid with straight legs; however, when differentiating between the two, the term &quot;tacking&quot; is used for straight-leg stapling, while the term &quot;stapling&quot; is used for bent-leg stapling.

===Specifications===

Modern staples for paper staplers are made from zinc-plated steel wires glued together and bent to form a long strip of staples. Staple strips are commonly available as &quot;full strips&quot; with 210 staples per strip. Both copper plated and more expensive stainless steel staples which do not rust are also available, but uncommon.

Some staple sizes are used more commonly than others, depending on the application required. Some companies have unique staples just for their products. Staples from one manufacturer may or may not fit another manufacturer&#x27;s unit even if they look similar and serve the same purpose.

Staples are often described as X/Y (e.g. 24/6 or 26/6), where the first number X is the gauge of the wire (AWG), and the second number Y is the length of the shank (leg) in millimeters. Some exceptions to this rule include staple sizes like No. 10.

Common sizes for the home and office include: 26/6, 24/6, 24/8, 13/6, 13/8 and No. 10 for mini staplers. Common sizes for heavy duty staplers include: 23/8, 23/12, 23/15, 23/20, 23/24, 13/10, and 13/14.

Stapleless staplers cut and bend paper without using metal fasteners.

There are few standards for staple size, length and thickness. This has led to many different incompatible staples and staplers systems, all serving the same purpose or applications.

24/6 staples are described by the German DIN 7405 standard.

In the United States, the specifications for non-medical industrial staples are described in ASTM F1667-15, Standard Specification for Driven Fasteners: Nails, Spikes, and Staples. A heavy duty office staple might be designated as F1667 STFCC-04: ST indicates staple, FC indicates flat top crown, C indicates cohered (joined into a strip), and 04 is the dash number for a staple with a length of 0.250 inch (6 mm), a leg thickness of 0.020 inch (500 μm), a leg width of 0.030 inch (800 μm), and a crown width of 0.500 inch (13 mm).

===In the home===

Staples are most commonly used to bind a stack of individual paper pages. A mechanical or electrical stapler may apply them by passing them through the paper pages and then clinching the staple legs that protrude from the bottom of the page stack.

When using a stapler, the papers to be fastened are placed between the main body and the anvil. The papers are pinched between the body and the anvil, then a drive blade pushes on the crown of the staple on the end of the staple strip. The staple breaks from the end of the strip and the legs of the staple are forced through the paper. As the legs hit the grooves in the anvil they are bent to hold the pages together. Many staplers have an anvil in the form of a &quot;pinning&quot; or &quot;stapling&quot; switch. This allows a choice between bending in or out. The outward bent staples are easier to remove and are for temporary fastening or &quot;pinning&quot;.

Most staplers are capable of stapling without the anvil to drive straight leg staples for tacking.

There are various types of staples for paper, including heavy-duty staples, designed for use on documents 20, 50, or over 100 pages thick. There are also speedpoint staples, which have slightly sharper teeth so they can go through paper more easily.

===In business===
Staples are commonly considered a neat and efficient method of binding paperwork because they are relatively unobtrusive, low cost, and readily available.

Large staples found on corrugated cardboard boxes have folded legs. They are applied from the outside and do not use an anvil; jaw-like appendages push through the cardboard alongside the legs and bend them from the outside.

Saddle stitch staplers, also known as &quot;booklet staplers,&quot; feature a longer reach from the pivot point than general-purpose staplers and bind pages into a booklet or &quot;signature&quot;. Some can use &quot;loop-staples&quot; that enable the user to integrate folded matter into ring books and binders.

Outward clinch staples are blind staples. There is no anvil, and they are applied with a staple gun. When applied, each staple leg forms a curve bending outwards. This is in part caused by the shape of the crown, which is like an inverted &quot;V&quot;, and not flat as in ordinary staples. Also, the legs are sharpened with an inside bevel point, causing them to tend to go outwards when forced into the base material. These staples are used for upholstery work, especially in vehicles, where they are used for fastening fabric or leather to a foam base. These staples are also used when installing fiberglass insulation batts around air ducts- the FSK paper sheathing is overlapped, and the two layers are stapled together before sealing with tape.

===In packaging===
Staples are used in various types of packaging.
* Staples can attach items to paperboard for carded packaging
* Staples of stitches can be used to attach the manufacturer&#x27;s joint of corrugated boxes
* Staples are used to close corrugated boxes. Small (nominally -inch crown) staples can be applied to a box with a post stapler. Wider crown (nominally -inch) staples can be applied with a blind clincher
* Staples can help fabricate and attach paperwork to wooden boxes and crates.

==In construction==
Construction staples are commonly larger, have a more varied use, and are delivered by a staple gun or hammer tacker. Staple guns do not have backing anvils and are exclusively used for tacking (with the exception of outward-clinch staplers used for fastening duct insulation). They typically have staples made from thicker metal. Some staple guns use arched staples for fastening small cables, e.g. phone or cable TV, without damaging the cable. Devices known as hammer tackers or staple hammers operate without complex mechanics as a simple head loaded with a strip of staples drives them directly; this method requires a measure of skill. Powered electric staplers or pneumatic staplers drive staples easily and accurately; they are the simplest manner of applying staples, but are hindered by a cord or hose. Cordless electric staplers use a battery, typically rechargeable and sometimes replaceable.

==In medicine==


Surgical staples are used for the closing of incisions and wounds, a function also performed by sutures.

<doc id="351038" wikidata="Q1199980" url="?curid=351038" title="Derbyshire Dales">
<text>Derbyshire Dales ( ) is a local government district in Derbyshire, England. The district was created in 1974 as West Derbyshire; the name was changed to Derbyshire Dales in 1987. The council is based in the town of Matlock, and the district also includes the towns of Ashbourne, Bakewell, Darley Dale and Wirksworth, as well as numerous villages and extensive rural areas. Much of the district is within the Peak District National Park.

The neighbouring districts are High Peak, Sheffield, North East Derbyshire, Amber Valley, South Derbyshire, East Staffordshire and Staffordshire Moorlands.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 as one of nine districts within Derbyshire. The new district covered the area of six former rural and urban districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Ashbourne Rural District
*Ashbourne Urban District
*Bakewell Rural District
*Bakewell Urban District
*Matlock Urban District
*Wirksworth Urban District 
The new district was initially named &quot;West Derbyshire&quot;, reflecting its position within the wider county. The council changed the name to &quot;Derbyshire Dales&quot; with effect from 1 January 1987.

==Governance==


Derbyshire Dales District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Derbyshire County Council. The district is also entirely covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government. In the parts of the district within the Peak District National Park town planning is the responsibility of the Peak District National Park Authority. The district council appoints two of its councillors to serve on the 30-person National Park Authority.

Since 2014 the district has been a non-constituent member of the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority (formerly known as the Sheffield City Region); the council sends representatives to meetings of the combined authority, but the electorate of Derbyshire Dales do not vote in elections for the Mayor of South Yorkshire.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2023. Following the 2023 election an alliance of the Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Greens formed to lead the council as a joint administration.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1995 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and two by-elections in February 2024, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 34 councillors representing 21 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The district is entirely within the Derbyshire Dales parliamentary constituency, created in 2010. The constituency is slightly larger than the district, also including parts of Amber Valley.

===Premises===
The council is based at Matlock Town Hall on Bank Road in Matlock. The oldest part of the building was built as a house called Bridge House. It was bought by the local council in 1894 and a large Italianate extension facing Bank Road was completed in 1898. The building served as the headquarters of Matlock Urban District Council between 1894 and 1974. Following local government reorganisation further large extensions were added in 1979.

==Places and parishes==

The district is entirely divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Ashbourne, Bakewell, Darley Dale, Matlock and Wirksworth take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

<text>Viral marketing is a business strategy that uses existing social networks to promote a product mainly on various social media platforms. Its name refers to how consumers spread information about a product with other people, much in the same way that a virus spreads from one person to another. It can be delivered by word of mouth, or enhanced by the network effects of the Internet and mobile networks.

The concept is often misused or misunderstood, as people apply it to any successful enough story without taking into account the word &quot;viral&quot;.

Viral advertising is personal and, while coming from an identified sponsor, it does not mean businesses pay for its distribution. Most of the well-known viral ads circulating online are ads paid by a sponsor company, launched either on their own platform (company web page or social media profile) or on social media websites such as YouTube. Consumers receive the page link from a social media network or copy the entire ad from a website and pass it along through e-mail or posting it on a blog, web page or social media profile. Viral marketing may take the form of video clips, interactive Flash games, advergames, ebooks, brandable software, images, text messages, email messages, or web pages. The most commonly utilized transmission vehicles for viral messages include pass-along based, incentive based, trendy based, and undercover based. However, the creative nature of viral marketing enables an &quot;endless amount of potential forms and vehicles the messages can utilize for transmission&quot;, including mobile devices.

The ultimate goal of marketers interested in creating successful viral marketing programs is to create viral messages that appeal to individuals with high social networking potential (SNP) and that have a high probability of being presented and spread by these individuals and their competitors in their communications with others in a short period.

The term &quot;viral marketing&quot; has also been used pejoratively to refer to stealth marketing campaigns—marketing strategies that advertise a product to people without them knowing they are being marketed to.

==History==
The emergence of &quot;viral marketing&quot;, as an approach to advertisement, has been tied to the popularization of the notion that ideas spread like viruses. The field that developed around this notion, memetics, peaked in popularity in the 1990s. As this then began to influence marketing gurus, it took on a life of its own in that new context.

The brief career of Australian pop singer Marcus Montana is largely remembered as an early example of viral marketing. In early 1989, thousands of posters declaring &quot;Marcus is Coming&quot; were placed around Sydney, generating discussion and interest within the media and the community about the meaning of the mysterious advertisements. The campaign successfully made Montana&#x27;s musical debut a talking point, but his subsequent music career was a failure.

The term viral strategy was first used in marketing in 1995, in a pre-digital marketing era, by a strategy team at Chiat / Day advertising in LA (now TBWA LA), led by Lorraine Ketch and Fred Sattler, for the launch of the first PlayStation for Sony Computer Entertainment. Born from a need to combat huge target cynicism the insight was that people reject things pushed at them but seek out things that elude them. Chiat / Day created a &#x27;stealth&#x27; campaign to go after influencers and opinion leaders, using street teams for the first time in brand marketing and layered an intricate omni-channel web of info and intrigue. Insiders picked up on it and spread the word. Within 6 months, PlayStation was number one in its category—Sony&#x27;s most successful launch in history.

There is debate on the origin and the popularization of the specific term &quot;viral marketing&quot;. The term is found in &quot;PC User&quot; magazine in 1989 with a somewhat differing meaning. It was later used by Jeffrey Rayport in the 1996 &quot;Fast Company&quot; article &quot;The Virus of Marketing&quot;, and Tim Draper and Steve Jurvetson of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson in 1997 to describe Hotmail&#x27;s practice of appending advertising to outgoing mail from their users.

Doug Rushkoff, a media critic, wrote about viral marketing on the Internet in 1996. The assumption is that if such an advertisement reaches a &quot;susceptible&quot; user, that user becomes &quot;infected&quot; (i.e., accepts the idea) and shares the idea with others &quot;infecting them&quot;, in the viral analogy&#x27;s terms. As long as each infected user shares the idea with more than one susceptible user on average (i.e., the basic reproductive rate is greater than one—the standard in epidemiology for qualifying something as an epidemic), the number of infected users grows according to an exponential curve. Of course, the marketing campaign may be successful even if the message spreads more slowly, if this user-to-user sharing is sustained by other forms of marketing communications, such as public relations or advertising.

Bob Gerstley wrote about algorithms designed to identify people with high &quot;social networking potential.&quot; Gerstley employed SNP algorithms in quantitative marketing research. In 2004, the concept of the &quot;alpha user&quot; was coined to indicate that it had now become possible to identify the focal members of any viral campaign, the &quot;hubs&quot; who were most influential. Alpha users could be targeted for advertising purposes most accurately in mobile phone networks, due to their personal nature.

In early 2013 the first ever Viral Summit was held in Las Vegas. The summit attempted to identify similar trends in viral marketing methods for various media.

==What makes things go viral==
According to the book &quot;Contagious: Why Things Catch On&quot;, there are six key factors that drive virality. They are organized in an acronym called STEPPS which stands for:
* Social Currency – the better something makes people look, the more likely they will be to share it
* Triggers – things that are top of mind are more likely to be tip of tongue
* Emotion – when we care, we share
* Public – the easier something is to see, the more likely people are to imitate it
* Practical Value – people share useful information to help others
* Stories – Trojan Horse stories carry messages and ideas along for the ride
The goal of a viral marketing campaign is to widely disseminate marketing content through sharing &amp; liking.

Another important factor that drives virality is the propagativity of the content, referring to the ease with which consumers can redistribute it. This includes the effort required to share the content, the network size and type of the chosen distribution medium, and the proximity of shareable content with its means of redistribution (i.e. a &#x27;Share&#x27; button).

== Psychology of Viral Marketing ==
To form deeper connections with viewers and increase the chances of virality, many marketers use psychological principles. They argue that this approach is scientific and can foster an environment where the odds of gaining traction are much higher. 

People find psychological safety and can develop a sense of trust when more people interact with online content. For this reason, marketers work to develop media that resonates with viewers on a deeper, emotional level as this approach frequently results in higher engagement. This level of interaction serves as a sign of approval, reducing the personal risk that is subconsciously linked to associating oneself with a company or brand’s content.

Professor Jonah Berger at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School of Business affirms that marketing campaigns that trigger psychological responses linked to strong emotions tend to perform better. In particular, Berger found that positive emotions like happiness, joy, and excitement have more successful share rates than their negative counterparts. This outcome results from the human instinct to respond more positively to content with activating emotions, increasing the desire to share content, which contributes to its virality.

Viral marketing utilizes the primitive feeling of frisson to increase their view and share counts. This feeling of excitement is considered powerful because of its ability to cause a physical response. From increased heart rates to full body chills, Professor Brent Coker at the University of Melbourne describes that this approach to marketing triggers a primitive response that immerses the viewer in the content on a deeper level.  

Researchers Juliana Fernandes from the University of Florida and Sigal Segev from the Florida International University also found that people are more inclined to share emotional campaigns over those that are heavily informational. They claim that consumers do not often care to learn about a product’s actual features and benefits. Instead, people prefer to be immersed in experience-based content that creates an emotional impact. Companies and brands can benefit from treating their content in this manner and go viral more frequently than those who do not.

Social proof is another psychological phenomenon that impacts viral content. Experts in this field argue that it is a natural instinct to want to behave similarly to others because it results in positive validation. This phenomenon explains the human need to conform, so marketers focus on creating engaging content that encourages interactions and causes a snowball effect. This subconsciously influences people to like, comment, and share if they already see others doing the same.

Social proof goes further by providing people with a form of social currency. When individuals interact with and share content, they become associated with the topics at hand. People naturally tend to perceive one another, and this pattern carries over to the digital world. As a result, many people tend to be vigilant about the viral marketing they engage with, since they want to be perceived positively. Companies and brands have the opportunity to develop social currency themselves by aligning with their target audiences and creating marketing campaigns that fit their interests or match their values. The more the content aligns with a company’s intended audience, the higher the chances a campaign is to go viral. 

==Methods and metrics==

According to marketing professors Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein, to make viral marketing work, three basic criteria must be met, i.e., giving the right message to the right messengers in the right environment:

#Messenger: Three specific types of messengers are required to ensure the transformation of an ordinary message into a viral one: market mavens, social hubs, and salespeople. Market mavens are individuals who are continuously &#x27;on the pulse&#x27; of things (information specialists); they are usually among the first to get exposed to the message and who transmit it to their immediate social network. Social hubs are people with an exceptionally large number of social connections; they often know hundreds of different people and have the ability to serve as connectors or bridges between different subcultures. Salespeople might be needed who receive the message from the market maven, amplify it by making it more relevant and persuasive, and then transmit it to the social hub for further distribution. Market mavens may not be particularly convincing in transmitting the information.
#Message: Only messages that are both memorable and sufficiently interesting to be passed on to others have the potential to spur a viral marketing phenomenon. Making a message more memorable and interesting or simply more infectious, is often not a matter of major changes but minor adjustments. It should be unique and engaging with a main idea that motivates the recipient to share it widely with friends – a &quot;must-see&quot; element.
#Environment: The environment is crucial in the rise of successful viral marketing – small changes in the environment lead to huge results, and people are much more sensitive to environment. The timing and context of the campaign launch must be right.

Whereas Kaplan, Haenlein and others reduce the role of marketers to crafting the initial viral message and seeding it, futurist and sales and marketing analyst Marc Feldman, who conducted IMT Strategies&#x27; viral marketing study in 2001, carves a different role for marketers which pushes the &#x27;art&#x27; of viral marketing much closer to &#x27;science&#x27;.

===Metrics===
To clarify and organize the information related to potential measures of viral campaigns, the key measurement possibilities should be considered in relation to the objectives formulated for the viral campaign. In this sense, some of the key cognitive outcomes of viral marketing activities can include measures such as the number of views, clicks, and hits for specific content, as well as the number of shares in social media, such as likes on Facebook or retweets on Twitter, which demonstrate that consumers processed the information received through the marketing message. Measures such as the number of reviews for a product or the number of members for a campaign web page quantify the number of individuals who have acknowledged the information provided by marketers. Besides statistics that are related to online traffic, surveys can assess the degree of product or brand knowledge, though this type of measurement is more complicated and requires more resources.

Related to consumers&#x27; attitudes toward a brand or even toward the marketing communication, different online and social media statistics, including the number of likes and shares within a social network, can be used. The number of reviews for a certain brand or product and the quality assessed by users are indicators of attitudes. Classical measures of consumer attitude toward the brand can be gathered through surveys of consumers.
Behavioral measures are very important because changes in consumers&#x27; behavior and buying decisions are what marketers hope to see through viral campaigns. There are numerous indicators that can be used in this context as a function of marketers&#x27; objectives. Some of them include the most known online and social media statistics such as number and quality of shares, views, product reviews, and comments. Consumers&#x27; brand engagement can be measured through the K-factor, the number of followers, friends, registered users, and time spent on the website. Indicators that are more bottom-line oriented focus on consumers&#x27; actions after acknowledging the marketing content, including the number of requests for information, samples, or test-drives. Nevertheless, responses to actual call-to-action messages are important, including the conversion rate.
Consumers&#x27; behavior is expected to lead to contributions to the bottom line of the company, meaning increase in sales, both in quantity and financial amount. However, when quantifying changes in sales, managers need to consider other factors that could potentially affect sales besides the viral marketing activities. Besides positive effects on sales, the use of viral marketing is expected to bring significant reductions in marketing costs and expenses.

=== Methods ===
Viral marketing often involves and utilizes: 
* Customer participation and polling services
* Industry-specific organization contributions
* Web search engines and blogs
* Mobile smartphone integration
* Multiple forms of print and direct marketing
* Target marketing web services
* Search engine optimization (SEO)
* Social media optimization (SMO)
* Television and radio
* Influencer marketing

Viral target marketing is based on three important principles:
# Social profile gathering
# Proximity market analysis
# Real-time key word density analysis

By applying these three important disciplines to an advertising model, a VMS company is able to match a client with their targeted customers at a cost-effective advantage.

The Internet makes it possible for a campaign to go viral very fast; it can, so to speak, make a brand famous overnight. However, the Internet and social media technologies themselves do not make a brand viral; they just enable people to share content to other people faster. Therefore, it is generally agreed that a campaign must typically follow a certain set of guidelines in order to potentially be successful:
* It must be appealing to most of the audience.
* It must be worth sharing with friends and family. 
* A large platform, e.g. YouTube or Facebook must be used.
* An initial boost to gain attention is used, e.g. seeding, buying views, or sharing to Facebook fans.
* The content is of good quality.
* Demographics - It must be correlated with the Region &amp; Society.

=== Drivers of success ===
Wilert Puriwat and Suchart Tripopsakul, who read over countless academic journals on viral marketing, gathered there knowledge to propose what they called the &quot;7I&#x27;s of effective word-of-mouth marketing campaigns.&quot; These seven I&#x27;s can be used to highlight where the success of a viral marketing campaign comes from. While what Puriwat and Tripopsakul publish outlines what makes an effective campaign, there is also forewarnings that negative word-of-mouth messages about a brand or product have more power over a consumers purchasing decision. With that being said, the 7I&#x27;s are as follow:

* Invisibility: The more distant an advertisement feels from being an advertisement, the more likely it is that the population will share the message with the people they are connected to. Puriwat and Tripopsakul suggest in their paper that marketers should be &quot;balancing the branding element with the quality of content&quot; to create an effect campaign.
* Identity: Identity has to do with the marketing&#x27;s ability to positively promote the sharers personal traits that they wish to exemplify. To get the consumers themselves to share your marketing campaign it must match the aspects that they are wishing to emit to the people they are sharing with, especially over social media.
* Innovation: Marketing campaigns that venture off from what has been done before raises the likelihood that word will spread. Deviating from the norm through means such as surprising the audience or using humor can create the innovation needed to engage the audience and distance themselves from being just another advert.
* Insight: What insight means in this context is that the marketing team should be looking at ways that their campaign can have an effect on the consumer on an emotional level. Instead of just sharing a marketing campaign that tells the viewer how great the product or service is, the campaign should elicit a positive feeling in the viewer that confirms how they feel. This leads to an increased likelihood that the advertisement would be share.
* Instantaneity: The instantaneity of a given campaign has to do with how well the initial deliverable can be intertwined with recent trends and current popular topics. This all-encompassing leg of the 7I&#x27;s covers topics such as timeliness on when the campaign is initially launched, how trendy it is to share the viral advert with the people around you, and also includes the use of the correct celebrity for the moment. Using celebrities in ads is not a new idea, however the right celebrity to elicit the correct feeling in the viewer goes a long way in increasing success.
* Integration: The integration of the viral marketing scheme is how well does the viral moment feed consumers into other marketing avenues for the company. While successfully creating a viral marketing campaign benefits the company by increasing the total amount impressions based on the financial investment, you still need the consumers to further interact with your brand outside of sharing. This can be done through the channeling of consumers to other marketing avenues such as websites and personal social media pages that can increase brand familiarity.
* Interactivity: The interactivity of a marketing campaign draws its importance based on the fact that a normal marketing campaign pushes its consumers to just buy or agree with what is being promoted. This differs from viral marketing since you know need to close the gap between the brand and the viewer to the point that there is public interaction between the two. Often times this public interaction is negative in nature without viral marketing since forewarnings on products are often shared between consumers. This is why having an interactive avenue through viral marketing can correct the balance between negative and positive discussion of a brand through consumer to consumer networks.

Using these seven described aspects of viral marketing, the two ran a statistical test utilizing a survey of 286 people on their thoughts of recent viral marketing efforts. The questions in the survey gauged whether each point from the 7I&#x27;s were met in the campaign using Likert scale questions and ended with questions on brand preference and brand recognition. While many conclusions were drawn from the statistical analysis, the prominent ones to be shared were based around age groups and interaction results. Wilert and Tripopsakul found that viral marketing is a tool that has shown to be more beneficial in targeting a younger demographic than the older audience. They also found that consumers who partook in any interaction with a brands viral marketing campaign more often than not had a positive increase in that brands perception.

== Social networking ==
The growth of social networks significantly contributed to the effectiveness of viral marketing. As of 2009, two-thirds of the world&#x27;s Internet population visits a social networking service or blog site at least every week. Facebook alone has over 1 billion active users. In 2009, time spent visiting social media sites began to exceed time spent emailing. A 2010 study found that 52% of people who view news online forward it on through social networks, email, or posts.

=== Social media ===
The introduction of social media has caused a change in how viral marketing is used and the speed at which information is spread and users interact. This has prompted many companies to use social media as a way to market themselves and their products, with Elsamari Botha and Mignon Reyneke stating that viral messages are &quot;playing an increasingly important role in influencing and shifting public opinion on corporate reputations, brands, and products as well as political parties and public personalities to name but a few.&quot;

== Influencers ==
In business, it is indicated that people prefer interaction with humans to a logo. Influencers build up a relationship between a brand and their customers. Companies would be left behind if they neglected the trend of influencers in viral marketing, as over 60% of global brands have used influencers in marketing in 2016.
Influencers correlate to the level of customers&#x27; involvement in companies&#x27; marketing. First, unintentional influences, because of brand satisfaction and low involvement, their action is just to deliver a company&#x27;s message to a potential user. Secondly, users will become salesmen or promoters for a particular company with incentives. For example, ICQ offered their users benefits to promote a product to their friends. A recent trend in business is to offer incentives to individual users for re-posting an advertisement&#x27;s message to their own profiles.

Marketers and agencies commonly consider celebrities as a good influencer with endorsement work. This conception is similar to celebrity marketing. Based on a survey, 69% of company marketing department and 74% of agencies are currently working with celebrities in the UK. The celebrity types come along with their working environment. Traditional celebrities are considered singers, dancers, actors or models. These types of public characters are continuing to be the most commonly used by company marketers. The survey found that 4 in 10 company having worked with these traditional celebrities in the prior year. However, people these years are spending more time on social media rather than traditional media such as TV. The researchers also claim that customers are not firmly believed celebrities are effectively influential.

Social media stars such as YouTuber Zoella or Instagrammer Aimee Song are followed by millions of people online. Online celebrities have connection and influence with their followers because they frequently and realisticly converse and interact on the Internet through comments or likes.

This trend captured by marketers who are used to explore new potential customers. Agencies are placing social media stars alongside singers and musicians at the top of the heap of celebrity types they had worked with. And there are more than 28% of company marketers having worked with one social media celebrity in the previous year.

===Benefits===
====For companies====
Using influencers in viral marketing provides companies several benefits. It enables companies to spend little time and budget on their marketing communication and brand awareness promotion. For example, Alberto Zanot, in the 2006 FIFA Football World Cup, shared Zinedine Zidane&#x27;s headbutt against Italy and engaged more than 1.5 million viewers in less than the very first hour. Secondly, it enhances the credibility of messages. These trust-based relationships grab the audience&#x27;s attention, create customers&#x27; demand, increase sales and loyalty, or simply drive customers&#x27; attitude and behavior. In the case of Coke, Millennials changed their mind about the product, from parents&#x27; drink to the beverage for teens. It built up Millennials&#x27; social needs by &#x27;sharing a Coke&#x27; with their friends. This created a deep connection with Gen Y, dramatically increased sales (+11% compared with last year) and market share (+1.6%).

==== Benefits for influencers ====
No doubt that harnessing influencers would be a lucrative business for both companies and influencers. The concept of &#x27;influencer&#x27; is no longer just an &#x27;expert&#x27; but also anyone who delivers and influence on the credibility of a message (e.g. blogger) In 2014, BritMums, network sharing family&#x27;s daily life, had 6,000 bloggers and 11,300 views per month on average and became endorsers for some particular brand such as Coca-Cola, Morrison. Another case, Aimee Song who had over 3.6m followers on the Instagram page and became Laura Mercier&#x27;s social media influencers, gaining $500,000 monthly.

====For consumers====
Decision-making process seems to be hard for customers these days. Millers (1956) argued that people suffered from short-term memory. This links to difficulties in customers&#x27; decision-making process and Paradox of Choice, as they face various adverts and newspapers daily. 
Influencers serve as a credible source for customers&#x27; decision-making process. Neilsen reported that 80% of consumers appreciated a recommendation of their acquaintances, as they have reasons to trust in their friends delivering the messages without benefits and helping them reduce perceived risks behind choices.

=== Risks of using the wrong influencer ===

==== Risks for the company ====
The main risk coming from the company is for it to target the wrong influencer or segment. Once the content is online, the sender won&#x27;t be able to control it anymore. It is therefore vital to aim at a particular segment when releasing the message. This is what happened to the company BlendTech which released videos showing the blender could blend anything, and encouraged users to share videos. This mainly caught the attention of teenage boys who thought it funny to blend and destroy anything they could; even though the videos went viral, they did not target potential buyers of the product. This is considered to be one of the major factors that affects the success of the online promotion. It is critical and inevitable for the organisations to target the right audience. Another risk with internet is that a company&#x27;s video could end up going viral on the other side of the planet where their products are not even for sale.

==== Risks emanating from the influencers ====
According to a paper by Duncan Watts and colleagues entitled: &quot;Everyone&#x27;s an influencer&quot;, the most common risk in viral marketing is that of the influencer not passing on the message, which can lead to the failure of the viral marketing campaign. A second risk is that the influencer modifies the content of the message. A third risk is that influencers pass on the wrong message. This can result from a misunderstanding or as a deliberate move.

== Notable examples ==
=== Hotmail Tagline ===
Between 1996 and 1997, Hotmail was one of the first internet businesses to become extremely successful utilizing viral marketing techniques by inserting the tagline &quot;Get your free e-mail at Hotmail&quot; at the bottom of every e-mail sent out by its users. Hotmail was able to sign up 12 million users in 18 months. At the time, this was historically the fastest growth of any user based media company. By the time Hotmail reached 66 million users, the company was establishing 270,000 new accounts each day.

=== Dollar Shave Club YouTube Video ===
On March 6, 2012, Dollar Shave Club launched their online video campaign. In the first 48 hours of their video debuting on YouTube they had over 12,000 people signing up for the service. The video cost just $4500 to make and as of November 2015 has had more than 21 million views. The video was considered one of the best viral marketing campaigns of 2012 and won &quot;Best Out-of-Nowhere Video Campaign&quot; at the 2012 AdAge Viral Video Awards.

=== Oreo Power Outage ===
During the 2013 Super Bowl, the Mercedes-Benz stadium suffered from a massive power outage. Oreo took advantage of the power outage and created a viral marketing campaign, incorporating a black and white image of an Oreo. The image included a text that stated, “You can still dunk in the dark.” A caption was also included that stated “No Power? No problem.” Due to Oreo’s quick thinking and clever marketing created traction and caused thousands of tweets and retweets. The marketing tactic that Oreo used to bring traction to the Oreo Company is referred to as newsjacking, which companies use to bring more customers to their brand using clever marketing tactics.

=== Spotify Wrapped ===
Spotify Wrapped is a viral marketing campaign by Spotify released annually since 2016 between November 29 and December 6, allowing users to view a compilation of data about their activity on the platform over the preceding year, and inviting them to share a colorful pictorial representation of it on social media. Other brands started releasing similar features, like Apple with Apple Music Replay. In 2021, 120 million users accessed Spotify Wrapped.

=== Elf Original Song ===
Since Elf is an older brand, they have to get creative in how they market their products to their newer audience. They created a 15 second song called #Eyes lips face in October 2019 for their customers to utilize in whatever form they choose on social media. Elf stands for eyes, lips and face. Social media can help bring traction and awareness to these brands to bring in the most people possible which is more money for them. Elf created a campaign to bring awareness to their brand. Elf made history with this marketing tactic, being the first makeup company to utilize a song, an original song at that, as a promotion tool. “Elf collaborated with Grammy-winning producer iLL Wayno and rising artist Holla FyeSixWun to create a catchy 15-second clip” (House of Marketers) These artists strategically handpicked specific influencers with big platforms to help further their song. These chosen influencers made videos with Elf&#x27;s song in the background bringing further awareness to the makeup brand. 
=== McDonald&#x27;s Grimace Shake ===
In June 2023, McDonald&#x27;s inadvertently took advantage of viral marketing with the rollout of Grimace&#x27;s Birthday Meal, and more specifically, the Grimace Shake. During its release, a popular trend emerged where people would take videos of themselves drinking the Grimace Shake and then would be found in disturbing positions with purple goo (assumed to be from the shake) splattered across them. McDonald&#x27;s, while not responsible for the trend themselves, did eventually go on to recognize it in a Twitter post that read (as Grimace): &quot;meee pretending i don&#x27;t see the grimace shake trendd&quot;. While the Grimace&#x27;s Birthday campaign was already a success for McDonald&#x27;s, the trend boosted sales even higher and kept them high all the way until the end of the promotion on June 29.

=== Ghostface Real Estate Listing ===
In Autumn 2019, a real estate listing for a century-old home in Lansing, Michigan went viral when the listing agent (James Pyle) used the Ghostface character from the &quot;Scream&quot; movie in marketing photos that showcased the home on Realtor.com and Zillow. The listing went live on September 27, 2019, and quickly began trending on Facebook, garnering 300,000 views in 2 days, at which point a story on the unusual popularity of the listing appeared in a local newspaper. Pyle stated that wanted to do something fun and novel for the Halloween season but to keep the photos professional at the same time, and hired photographer Bradley Johnson to take several pictures of him dressed as Ghostface raking leaves in the backyard, preparing to carve a pumpkin in the kitchen, standing on the front and back porches, and peeking out behind curtains and doors. The following day, the story was picked up by several radio stations, including K102.5 in Kalamazoo, WCRZ in Burton, WOMC and ALT97 in Detroit, as well as the Metro Times newspaper in Detroit. Following the increased attention on the Zillow listing, over the next few days the story appeared on major news networks.
Pyle stated that a normal listing typically received under 150 views, and his goal was to get between 500 and 1,000 views of the home. However, the Zillow listing ended up receiving over 20,000 views by October 1, one million views by October 2 and exceeded 1.2 million views by October 3. It was estimated that the combined views of the listings on both sites (Zillow and Realtor.com) exceeded 5 million in 5 days. The listing received a cash offer within 4 days and the immense popularity resulted in the home becoming overbooked during the open house and subsequent viewings. Due to the success of the listing, Pyle was scheduled to appear on “Good Morning America” on October 2, 2019. He was quoted as saying that he didn&#x27;t think he would ever be able to duplicate the success of the listing, but he planned to try some additional variations for future listings. The listing continued to be popular even after the house was off the market. This approach was so successful that it became a recommended practice on Realtor.com.

<doc id="351048" wikidata="Q7614010" url="?curid=351048" title="Steve Sparks (pitcher, born 1965)">
<text>Steven William Sparks (born July 2, 1965) is a former knuckleball-throwing right-handed Major League Baseball pitcher and broadcaster. A graduate from Holland Hall School, he attended Sam Houston State University in 1987. In addition to the knuckler, Sparks threw an occasional slider and low-80s fastball.

Currently, he serves as the color commentator for the radio broadcasts of the Houston Astros, after being hired in 2013.

==Professional career==

===Milwaukee Brewers===
Sparks was drafted in the 5th round by the Milwaukee Brewers. He learned to throw the knuckle ball in 1991. He bounced around in the Brewers minor league system until 1995, which was when the Brewers added him to the starting rotation to begin the season. Before the 1995 season, Sparks was infamously known for having ripped a phone book and dislocating his non throwing shoulder, having kept him from making the team in 1994.

Sparks pitched in 33 games for the Brewers in 1995, also making 27 starts. He finished 9–11 with 3 complete games.

The following season, Sparks split time between pitching with the Brewers and pitching in AAA. He pitched in 11 games at AAA, going 2–6 with a 4.99 ERA while with the Brewers he pitched in 20 games (13 starts) and recording a record of 4–7 with a 6.60 ERA. He was beset by control issues, striking out 21 and walking 52 in 88.2 innings. He also allowed 19 home runs.

Sparks underwent Tommy John surgery in 1997. After the 1997 season, Sparks was let go by the organization, ending his 10-year run with the Brewers organization.

===Anaheim Angels===
In 1998, Sparks signed with the Angels while he recovered from surgery. On June 16, Sparks made his return since the end of the 1996 season, pitching en route to his first win since July 1996. For the season, Sparks finished with a 9–4 record in 22 games (20 starts). In 1999, Sparks&#x27; control issues returned, prohibiting him from gaining his effectiveness from the previous year. In 26 starts, he finished with a record of 5-11 and a 5.42 ERA. He induced 82 walks while striking out 73 in 147.2 innings.

===Detroit Tigers===
In 2000, the Tigers signed Sparks to a minor league deal. He made four appearances with the team before getting demoted to AAA, he went 5–7 in 14 starts at the minor league level. He got called back up on July 22. He finished the season in the rotation, going 7–5.

In 2001, Sparks enjoyed the best season of his career, setting career highs in wins (14), ERA (3.65), innings (232), complete games (8) and strikeouts (116).

Sparks regressed the following year, going 8–16 in 30 starts for the Tigers and recording the highest ERA in the American League (5.52). Sparks was demoted to the bullpen in 2003 in favor of rookie pitcher Jeremy Bonderman. Sparks was let go after 42 games and signed with the Oakland A&#x27;s 4 days later.

===Oakland Athletics===
Sparks latched on with the A&#x27;s and pitched in 9 games. His record between the A&#x27;s and Tigers was 0–6 in 51 games.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
In 2004, the Diamondbacks signed Sparks to a 1-year deal. Sparks finished 3–7 in 29 games (18 starts).

===San Diego Padres===
On January 25, 2005, Sparks was signed to a minor league deal with the Padres. He was injured for most of the season, only appearing in 3 starts in AAA. He was let go at mid season.

===Oakland Athletics (second stint)===
Sparks signed a minor league deal with the A&#x27;s, making 11 starts for the AAA level.

===Houston Astros===
After the 2005 season, he was signed by the Houston Astros to a minor league contract, but after being cut, he retired at age 40.

==Personal life==
Sparks lives in Houston and works as a color analyst for Houston Astros radio broadcasts.

<text>Konstantinos G. Karamanlis (, ; 8 March 1907 – 23 April 1998) was a Greek statesman who was the four-time Prime Minister of Greece and two-term president of the Third Hellenic Republic. A towering figure of Greek politics, his political career spanned portions of seven decades, covering much of the latter half of the 20th century.

Born near Serres in Macedonia, Karamanlis practiced law until his election to the Hellenic Parliament in 1936 as a member of the conservative People&#x27;s Party. Rising through the ranks of Greek politics after World War II, Karamanlis became Minister of Labour in 1947, and in 1951 he was named Minister for Public Works in Alexandros Papagos&#x27;s Greek Rally administration. He was appointed prime minister by King Paul of Greece after Papagos&#x27;s death in 1955. During his first term, he applied a program of rapid industrialization, heavy investment on infrastructure and improvement on agricultural production, which led to the post-war Greek economic miracle. He also implemented the extension of full voting rights to women, which had stood dormant since 1952. In foreign affairs, he pursued an aggressive policy toward Greek membership in the European Economic Community (EEC), and abandoned the government&#x27;s previous strategic goal for enosis (the unification of Greece and Cyprus) in favour of Cypriot independence.

In 1963, Karamanlis resigned following a disagreement with King Paul amidst spiralling political crises in Greece. He spent the next eleven years in self-imposed exile in Paris, while the country fell under military dictatorship after the 1967 coup d&#x27;état. After the fall of the junta in 1974, Karamanlis was recalled to Athens to assume interim premiership. This period, known as the Metapolitefsi, saw the country&#x27;s transition to a pluralist democracy. His new party, New Democracy, won a commanding victory in the November 1974 elections, which were followed by a plebiscite that abolished the monarchy and established the Third Hellenic Republic. In 1980, Karamanlis resigned as prime minister and was elected President of the Republic. In 1981, he oversaw Greece&#x27;s formal entry into the European Economic Community. He resigned from the presidency in 1985 but was again elected in 1990, and served until his retirement from active politics in 1995. Karamanlis died in 1998 at the age of 91.

== Early life ==
Karamanlis was born in the village of Proti, near the city of Serres, Macedonia, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire. He became a Greek citizen in 1913, after the region of Macedonia was annexed by Greece in the aftermath of the First and Second Balkan War. His father was Georgios Karamanlis, a teacher who fought during the Greek Struggle for Macedonia, in 1904–1908. After spending his childhood in Macedonia, he went to Athens to attain his degree in law. He practised law in Serres, entered politics with the conservative People&#x27;s Party and was elected Member of Parliament for the first time in the 1936 election at the age of 28. Health problems made him not participate in the Greco-Italian War.

During the Axis occupation, he spent his time between Athens and Serres, while in July 1944, he left to the Middle East to join the Greek government in exile.

== First premiership ==
After World War II, Karamanlis quickly rose through the ranks of Greek politics. His rise was strongly supported by fellow party-member and close friend Lambros Eftaxias, who served as Minister for Agriculture under the premiership of Konstantinos Tsaldaris. Karamanlis&#x27;s first cabinet position was Minister for Labour in 1947 under the same administration. In 1951, along with most prominent members of the People&#x27;s Party, Karamanlis joined the Greek Rally of Alexandros Papagos. When this party won the Greek legislative election on 9 September 1951, Karamanlis became Minister of Public Works in the Papagos administration. He won the admiration of the US Embassy for the efficiency with which he built road infrastructure and administered American aid programs.
When Papagos died after a brief illness (October 1955), King Paul of Greece appointed the 48-year-old Karamanlis as prime minister. The King&#x27;s appointment took the Greek political world by surprise, as it bypassed Stephanos Stephanopoulos and Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, two senior Greek Rally politicians who were widely considered as the heavyweights most likely to succeed Papagos. After becoming prime minister, Karamanlis reorganized the Greek Rally as the National Radical Union. One of the first bills he promoted as prime minister implemented the extension of full voting rights to women, which stood dormant although nominally approved in 1952. Karamanlis won three successive elections (February 1956, May 1958 and October 1961).

In 1959 he announced a five-year plan (1959-64) for the Greek economy, emphasizing improvement of agricultural and industrial production, heavy investment on infrastructure and the promotion of tourism, setting the bases of the post-WWII Greek economic miracle, though implementation was disrupted by the 1967 Coup d&#x27;état and the 7 years of dictatorship that followed. 

=== London-Zürich Agreements ===
On the international front, Karamanlis abandoned the government&#x27;s previous strategic goal for enosis (the unification of Greece and Cyprus) in favour of independence for Cyprus. In 1958, his government engaged in negotiations with the United Kingdom and Turkey, which culminated in the Zurich Agreement as a basis for a deal on the independence of Cyprus. In February 1959 the plan was ratified in London by the Cypriot leader Makarios III.

=== Merten affair ===
Max Merten was &quot;Kriegsverwaltungsrat&quot; (military administration counselor) of the Nazi German occupation forces in Thessaloniki. He was convicted in Greece and sentenced to a 25-year term as a war criminal in 1959. On 3 November of that year, Merten benefited from an amnesty for war criminals, and was set free and extradited to the Federal Republic of Germany, after political and economic pressure from West Germany (which, at the time, hosted thousands of Greek Gastarbeiter). Merten&#x27;s arrest also enraged Queen Frederica, a woman with German ties, who wondered whether &quot;this is the way mister district attorney understands the development of German and Greek relations&quot;.

In Germany, Merten was eventually acquitted from all charges due to &quot;lack of evidence.&quot; On 28 September 1960 German newspapers Hamburger Echo and Der Spiegel published excerpts of Merten&#x27;s deposition to the German authorities where Merten claimed that Karamanlis, the then Minister for the Interior, Takos Makris and his wife, Doxoula (whom he described as Karamanlis&#x27;s niece) along with then Deputy Minister of Defense Georgios Themelis were informers in Thessaloniki during the Nazi occupation of Greece. Merten alleged that Karamanlis and Makris were rewarded for their services with a business in Thessaloniki which belonged to a Greek Jew sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. He also alleged that he had pressured Karamanlis and Makris to grant amnesty and release him from prison.

Karamanlis rejected the claims as unsubstantiated and absurd, and accused Merten of attempting to extort money from him prior to making the statements. The West German government (Third Adenauer cabinet) also decried the accusations as calumniatory and libelous. Karamanlis accused the opposition party of instigating a smear campaign against him. Although Karamanlis never pressed charges against Merten, charges were pressed in Greece against Der Spiegel by Takos and Doxoula Makris and Themelis, and the magazine was found guilty of slander in 1963. Merten did not appear to testify during the Greek court proceedings. The Merten Affair remained at the centre of political discussions until early 1961.

Merten&#x27;s accusations against Karamanlis were never corroborated in a court of law. Historian Giannis Katris, an ardent critic of Karamanlis, argued in 1971 that Karamanlis should have resigned the premiership and pressed charges against Merten as a private individual in German courts, in order to fully clear his name. Nonetheless, Katris rejects the accusations as &quot;unsubstantiated&quot; and &quot;obviously fallacious&quot;.

=== European vision ===
Karamanlis as early as 1958 pursued an aggressive policy toward Greek membership in the EEC. He considered Greece&#x27;s entry into the EEC a personal dream because he saw it as the fulfillment of what he called &quot;Greece&#x27;s European Destiny&quot;. He personally lobbied European leaders, such as Germany&#x27;s Konrad Adenauer and France&#x27;s Charles de Gaulle followed by two years of intense negotiations with Brussels. His intense lobbying bore fruit and on 9 July 1961 his government and the Europeans signed the protocols of Greece&#x27;s Treaty of Association with the European Economic Community (EEC). The signing ceremony in Athens was attended by top government delegations from the six-member bloc of Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands, a precursor of the European Union. Economy Minister Aristidis Protopapadakis and Foreign Minister Evangelos Averoff were also present. German Vice-Chancellor Ludwig Erhard and Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak, a European Union pioneer and a Karlspreis winner like Karamanlis, were among the European delegates.

This had the profound effect of ending Greece&#x27;s economic isolation and breaking its political and economic dependence on US economic and military aid, mainly through NATO. Greece became the first European country to acquire the status of associate member of the EEC outside the six nation EEC group. In November 1962 the association treaty came into effect and envisaged the country&#x27;s full membership at the EEC by 1984, after the gradual elimination of all Greek tariffs on EEC imports. A financial protocol clause included in the treaty provided for loans to Greece subsidised by the community of about $300 million between 1962 and 1972 to help increase the competitiveness of the Greek economy in anticipation of Greece&#x27;s full membership. The Community&#x27;s financial aid package as well as the protocol of accession were suspended during the 1967–74 junta years and Greece was expelled from the EEC. As well, during the dictatorship, Greece resigned its membership in the Council of Europe fearing embarrassing investigations by the Council, following torture allegations.

Soon after returning to Greece during metapolitefsi Karamanlis reactivated his push for the country&#x27;s full EEC membership in 1975 citing political and economic reasons. Karamanlis was convinced that Greece&#x27;s membership in the EEC would ensure political stability in a nation having just undergone a transition from dictatorship to Democracy.

In May 1979 he signed the full treaty of accession. Greece became the tenth member of the EEC on 1 January 1981 three years earlier than the original protocol envisioned and despite the freezing of the treaty of accession during the junta (1967–1974).

== Crises and self-exile ==
In the 1961 elections, the National Radical Union won 50.8 percent of the popular vote and 176 seats. The elections were denounced by both main opposition parties, EDA and the Centre Union, who refused to recognise the result based on numerous cases of voter intimidation and irregularities, such as sudden massive increases in support for ERE against historical patterns, or the voting by deceased persons. The Centre Union alleged that the election result had been staged by the shadowy &quot;para-state&quot; (παρακράτος) agents, including the army leadership, the Greek Central Intelligence Service, and the notoriously right-wing National Guard Defence Battalions, according to a prepared emergency plan code-named &quot;Pericles&quot;. Although irregularities certainly occurred, the existence of &quot;Pericles&quot; was never proven, nor is it certain that the interference in the elections radically influenced the outcome. Nevertheless, Centre Union leader George Papandreou initiated an &quot;unrelenting struggle&quot; (&quot;ανένδοτος αγών&quot;) until new and fair elections were held.

===Lambrakis assassination===
Karamanlis&#x27;s position was further undermined, and Papandreou&#x27;s claims of an independently acting &quot;para-state&quot; given more credence, following the assassination of Grigoris Lambrakis, a leftist member of Parliament, by right-wing extremists during a pro-peace demonstration in Thessaloniki in May 1963, who were later revealed to have close links to the local gendarmerie. Karamanlis was shocked by the assassination, was heavily criticized by the opposition of Georgios Papandreou, and he stated:

The final straw for Karamanlis&#x27;s government was his clash with the Palace in summer 1963, over the projected visit of the royal pair to Britain. Karamanlis opposed the trip, as he feared that it would provide the occasion for demonstrations against the political prisoners still held in Greece since the Civil War. Karamanlis&#x27;s relations with the Palace had been declining for some time, particularly with Queen Frederika and the Crown Prince, but the Prime Minister also clashed with King Paul over the latter&#x27;s opposition to proposed constitutional amendments that would empower the government, the extravagant lifestyle of the royal family, and the near-monopoly that the King claimed over control of the armed forces. When the King rejected his advice to postpone the trip to London, Karamanlis resigned and left the country. In his absence, ERE was led by a committee composed of Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Konstantinos Rodopoulos and Panagis Papaligouras.

In the 1963 election, the National Radical Union, under his leadership, was defeated by the Centre Union under George Papandreou. Disappointed with the result, Karamanlis fled Greece under the name &quot;Triantafyllides&quot;. He spent the next 11 years in self-imposed exile in Paris, France. Karamanlis was succeeded by Panagiotis Kanellopoulos as the ERE leader.

In 1966, Constantine II of Greece sent his envoy Demetrios Bitsios to Paris on a mission to convince Karamanlis to return to Greece and resume a role in Greek politics. According to uncorroborated claims that were made by the former monarch only after both men had died, in 2006, Karamanlis replied to Bitsios that he would return under the condition that the King were to impose martial law, as was his constitutional prerogative.

U.S. journalist Cyrus L. Sulzberger has separately claimed that Karamanlis flew to New York to visit Lauris Norstad and lobby US support for a coup d&#x27;état in Greece that would establish a strong conservative regime under himself; Sulzberger alleges that Norstad declined to involve himself in such affairs.

Sulzberger&#x27;s account, which unlike that of the former King was delivered during the lifetime of those implicated (Karamanlis and Norstad), rested solely on the authority of his and Norstad&#x27;s word.

When in 1997, the former King reiterated Sulzberger&#x27;s allegations, Karamanlis stated that he &quot;will not deal with the former king&#x27;s statements because both their content and attitude are unworthy of comment.&quot; The deposed King&#x27;s adoption of Sulzberger&#x27;s claims against Karamanlis was castigated by left-leaning media, typically critical of Karamanlis, as &quot;shameless&quot; and &quot;brazen&quot;. It bears noting that, at the time, the former King referred exclusively to Sulzberger&#x27;s account, to support the theory of a planned coup by Karamanlis, and made no mention of the alleged 1966 meeting with Bitsios, which he would refer to only after both participants had died and could not respond.

On 21 April 1967, constitutional order was usurped by a coup d&#x27;état led by officers around Colonel George Papadopoulos. The King accepted to swear in the military-appointed government as the legitimate government of Greece, but launched an abortive counter-coup to overthrow the junta eight months later. Constantine and his family then fled the country.

== Stasi smear campaign ==
In 2001, former agents of the Eastern German secret police, the Stasi, claimed to Greek investigative reporters that during the Cold War, they had orchestrated an operation of evidence falsification, to present Karamanlis as having planned a coup and thus damage his reputation in an apparent disinformation propaganda campaign. The operation allegedly centered on a falsified conversation between Karamanlis and Strauss, a Bavarian officer of the King.

== Second premiership ==

=== Metapolitefsi (restoration of democracy) ===
In 1974, the invasion of Cyprus by the Turks led to the collapse of the military junta. On 23 July 1974, President Phaedon Gizikis called a meeting of old guard politicians, including Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Spiros Markezinis, Stephanos Stephanopoulos, Evangelos Averoff and others. The heads of the armed forces also participated in the meeting. The agenda was to appoint a national unity government that would lead the country to elections.

Former prime minister Panagiotis Kanellopoulos was originally suggested as the head of the new interim government. He was the interim prime minister originally deposed by the dictatorship in 1967 and a distinguished politician who had repeatedly criticized Papadopoulos and his successor. Raging battles were still taking place in Cyprus&#x27; north when Greeks took to the streets in all the major cities, celebrating the junta&#x27;s decision to relinquish power before the war in Cyprus could spill all over the Aegean. But talks in Athens were going nowhere with Gizikis&#x27; offer to Panagiotis Kanellopoulos to form a government.

Nonetheless, after all the other politicians departed without reaching a decision, Evangelos Averoff remained in the meeting room and further engaged Gizikis. He insisted that Karamanlis was the only political personality who could lead a successful transition government, taking into consideration the new circumstances and dangers both inside and outside the country. Gizikis and the heads of the armed forces initially expressed reservations, but they finally became convinced by Averoff&#x27;s arguments. Admiral Arapakis was the first, among the participating military leaders, to express his support for Karamanlis.

After Averoff&#x27;s decisive intervention, Gizikis decided to invite Karamanlis to assume the premiership. Throughout his stay in France, Karamanlis was a vocal opponent of the Regime of the Colonels, the military junta that seized power in Greece in April 1967. He was now called to end his self-imposed exile and restore democracy to the place where it was originally invented. Upon news of his impending arrival cheering Athenian crowds took to the streets chanting: Έρχεται! Έρχεται! &quot;He is coming! He is coming!&quot; Similar celebrations broke out all over Greece. Athenians in their thousands also went to the airport to greet him. Karamanlis was sworn in as prime minister under President pro tempore Phaedon Gizikis who remained in power in the interim, till December 1974, for legal continuity reasons until a new constitution could be enacted during metapolitefsi and was subsequently replaced by duly elected President Michail Stasinopoulos.

During the inherently unstable first weeks of the metapolitefsi, Karamanlis was forced to sleep aboard a yacht watched over by a destroyer for fear of a new coup. Karamanlis attempted to defuse the tension between Greece and Turkey, which were on the brink of war over the Cyprus crisis, through the diplomatic route. Two successive conferences in Geneva, where the Greek government was represented by George Mavros, failed to avert a full-scale invasion by Turkey on 14 August 1974 or the subsequent Turkish occupation of 37 percent of Cyprus. As a protest, Karamanlis led the country outside of the military branch of NATO and remained out until 1980.

The steadfast process of transition from military rule to a pluralist democracy proved successful. During this transition period of the metapolitefsi, Karamanlis legalized the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) that was banned since the civil war. The legalization of the communist party was considered by many as a gesture of political inclusionism and rapprochement. At the same time he also freed all political prisoners and pardoned all political crimes against the junta. Following through with his reconciliation theme he also adopted a measured approach to removing collaborators and appointees of the dictatorship from the positions they held in government bureaucracy, and declared that free elections would be held in November 1974, four months after the collapse of the Regime of the Colonels.

===Greek republic referendum===
Influenced by Gaullist principles, Karamanlis founded the conservative party of &quot;New Democracy&quot; and in the 1974 elections achieved a record 54.4% victory (the greatest electoral victory in modern Greek history), obtained a massive parliamentary majority and he was elected prime minister.

The elections were soon followed by the 1974 plebiscite on the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a Hellenic Republic, the televised 1975 trials (Greek Junta Trials) of the former dictators (who received death sentences for high treason and mutiny that were later commuted to life incarceration) and the writing of the new Constitution.

In 1977, &quot;New Democracy&quot; again won the elections, and Karamanlis continued to serve as prime minister until 1980. The external policy of his governments, for the first time since the war, favoured a multi-polar approach between US, Soviet Union and the Third World; a policy continued also by his successor Andreas Papandreou.

Under Karamanlis&#x27;s premiership, his government also undertook numerous nationalizations in several sectors, including banking and transportation. Karamanlis&#x27;s policies of economic statism, which fostered a large state-run sector, have been described by many as &quot;socialmania&quot;.

== First and second Presidency ==
===Accession of Greece to the European Communities===

Following his signing of the Accession Treaty with the European Economic Community (now the European Union) in 1979, Karamanlis relinquished the Premiership and was elected President of the Republic in 1980 by the Parliament, and in 1981 he oversaw Greece&#x27;s formal entry into the European Economic Community as its tenth member. He served until 1985, then resigned and was succeeded by Christos Sartzetakis by the dubious processes of Andreas Papandreou, which caused a constitutional crisis. His phrase became famous during the 1989 political crisis to characterize the state of affairs at the end of the second term of Papandreou: &quot;Hellas has been transformed to an endless bedlam.&quot;

In 1990, he was re-elected President by a conservative parliamentary majority (under the conservative government of then Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis) and served until 1995, when he was succeeded by Kostis Stephanopoulos.

== Later life ==
Karamanlis retired in 1995, at the age of 88, having won 5 parliamentary elections, and having spent 14 years as prime minister, 10 years as President of the Republic, and a total of more than sixty years in active politics. For his long service to democracy and as a pioneer of European integration from the earliest stages of the European Union, Karamanlis was awarded one of the most prestigious European prizes, the Karlspreis, in 1978. He bequeathed his archives to the Konstantinos Karamanlis Foundation, a conservative think tank he had founded and endowed.

Karamanlis died after a short illness in 1998, at the age of 91.

Karamanlis married Amalia Megapanou Kanellopoulou (1929–2020) in 1951, the niece of Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, a prominent politician. They divorced in 1972 in Paris, without ever having children. Karamanlis remained childless all his life.

== Legacy ==

Karamanlis has been praised for presiding over an early period of fast economic growth for Greece (1955–63) and for being the primary engineer of Greece&#x27;s successful bid for membership in the European Union.

His supporters lauded him as the charismatic &quot;Ethnarches&quot; (National Leader). Some of his left-wing opponents have accused him of condoning rightist &quot;para-statal&quot; groups, whose members undertook &quot;Via kai Notheia&quot; (Violence and Corruption), i.e., fraud during the electoral contests between ERE and Papandreou&#x27;s &quot;Center Union&quot; party, and were responsible for the assassination of Gregoris Lambrakis. Some of Karamanlis&#x27;s conservative opponents have criticized his socialist economic policies during the 1970s, which included the nationalization of Olympic Airways and Emporiki Bank and the creation of a large public sector. Karamanlis has also been criticized by Ange S. Vlachos for indecisiveness in his management of the Cyprus crisis in 1974 even though it is widely acknowledged that he skillfully avoided an all-out war with Turkey during that time.

Karamanlis is recognised for his successful restoration of Democracy during metapolitefsi and the repair of the two great national schisms by legalising the communist party and by establishing the system of parliamentary democracy in Greece. His successful prosecution of the junta during the junta trials and the heavy sentences imposed on the junta principals also sent a message to the army that the era of immunity from constitutional transgressions by the military was over. Karamanlis&#x27;s policy of European integration is also acknowledged to have ended the paternalistic relation between Greece and the United States.

His nephew Kostas Karamanlis later became the leader of the New Democracy party (Nea Demokratia) and Prime Minister of Greece from 2004 to 2009. Another nephew, also named Kostas Karamanlis, served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from 2019 to 2023.

== Controversies ==
Karamanlis has been heavily criticised for his stance on the Cyprus problem since the late 1950s where he forced Makarios III to sign the Zürich and London Agreements, threatening to withdraw Greek political support for the Greek Cypriots if he didn&#x27;t. In the summer of 1974, during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the Metapolitefsi, Karamanlis refused point blank to send help to Cyprus when asked by the acting President of Cyprus Glafcos Clerides infamously stating in the conversation &quot;Η Κύπρος κείται μακράν&quot; (&quot;Cyprus lies far away&quot;) for military aid. The only military aid Cyprus received from Greece was in the last days of the Junta regime, where Greek commandos from A&#x27; Raider Squadron under the codename Operation Niki which also stood to disprove the claim that Cyprus was too far. Karamanlis not only refused to prosecute the armed forces chiefs who refused to go to Cyprus&#x27; aid when Dimitrios Ioannidis had ordered them too, but also kept them in places of charge in the Armed Forces, dismissing both their role in the Cypriot coup d&#x27;état against Makarios, including Bonanos, Phaedon Gizikis and Petros Arapakis among others.

== Tributes ==
On 29 June 2005 an audio-visual tribute celebrating Konstantinos Karamanlis&#x27;s contribution to Greek culture took place at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus. George Remoundos was the stage director and Stavros Xarhakos conducted and selected the music. The event under the title of &quot;Cultural Memories&quot; was organised by the Konstantinos G. Karamanlis Foundation. In 2007 several events were held to celebrate 100 years since his birth.

<doc id="351052" wikidata="Q2193488" url="?curid=351052" title="The Wuzzles">
<text>The Wuzzles is an American short-lived animated television series created by Fred Wolf and produced by Disney Television Animation (then known as Walt Disney Pictures Television Animation Group) in their first of two productions. The series was broadcast from September 14 to December 7, 1985, on CBS. An idea pitched by Michael Eisner for his new Disney television animation studio, the premise is that the main characters are hybrids of two different animals. The series ran for one season of 13 episodes.

== Premise ==
&quot;The Wuzzles&quot; features a variety of short, rounded animal characters. Each is a roughly even, and colorful, mix of two different animal species (as the theme song mentions, &quot;livin&#x27; with a split personality&quot;), and all the characters sport wings on their backs, although only Bumblelion and Butterbear are seemingly capable of flight. All of the Wuzzles live on the Isle of Wuz. Double species are not limited to the Wuzzles themselves. From the appleberries they eat to the telephonograph in the home, or a luxury home called a castlescraper, nearly everything on Wuz is mixed together in the same way that the Wuzzles are. The characters in the show were marketed extensively — featured in children&#x27;s books, as poseable figures and plush toys (similar to Care Bears), and in a board game.

Disney premiered two animated series on the same day in the same time slot, 8:30 AM ET, in the United States, with the other being &quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; on NBC, and both series were successful during their first seasons. However, &quot;The Wuzzles&quot; ended production after its initial run. CBS canceled the show, and ABC picked it up and showed reruns during the 1986–1987 season; they aired it at 8:00 AM so that the two Disney shows would not be in competition with one another.

The series was a bigger success in the United Kingdom, where the first episode aired as a theatrical featurette in 1986 alongside a re-release of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Bambi&quot;. In the United Kingdom, &quot;The Wuzzles&quot; and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; were originally screened on the same channel (ITV) in 1985/1986; therefore, both series enjoyed high popularity. Reruns of the show were aired on both the Disney Channel and Toon Disney. Songwriter Stephen Geyer composed the theme song and performed the lead vocal.

== Characters ==
* The Narrator (voiced by Stan Freberg): The never-seen narrator welcomes the viewer to &quot;the Land of Wuz&quot; and is heard throughout each episode talking about different things.
* Bumblelion (voiced by Brian Cummings): Half bumblebee and half lion, Bumblelion is mostly lion in appearance. He is a short, squat orange furred creature with a pink mane, fuzzy antennae, a lion&#x27;s tail, small insect wings, and horizontal brown stripes up his tummy. He lives in a beehive, likes sports, is courageous, and has a crush on Butterbear. He is said to be the sort who &quot;rush[es] in where angels fear to tread&quot;. He and Eleroo are best friends.
* Eleroo (voiced by Henry Gibson): Half elephant and half kangaroo. One of the larger Wuzzles, Eleroo is purple, with the body shape and tail of a kangaroo and an elephant&#x27;s trunk and ears. He has a horizontally striped pouch (despite the fact that pouches are found only on female kangaroos). Eleroo has trouble remembering what he stores in his pouch. He is sweet, but accident-/disaster-prone. He and Bumblelion are best friends.
* Butterbear (voiced by Kathleen Helppie-Shipley): Half butterfly and half bear, Butterbear is mostly bear in appearance. She has yellow fur with a white tummy, larger wings than the other Wuzzles, and short antennae with flowers on their ends. She is a keen gardener who is gentle and patient despite the crazy adventures of her friends.
* Moosel (voiced by Bill Scott): Half moose and half seal, Moosel has a moose-like head with antlers, although he also sports flippers like a pinniped. Moosel, the smallest Wuzzle, is blue and purple. He has a vivid imagination, which makes him believe in monsters. He is the youngest of the Wuzzles. He and Rhinokey are best friends.
* Hoppopotamus (voiced by Jo Anne Worley): Half rabbit and half hippopotamus. She is called Hoppo by her friends. Hoppo is the largest Wuzzle. She is a hippopotamus with a rabbit&#x27;s ears, buck teeth and a fluffy tail. She has blue fur with a purple tummy, and she loves to sing and act. Hoppo is a pushy demanding diva, but she can be sweet. However, when toughness is called for (particularly in dealing with the regular villain, Crocosaurus), she is the toughest Wuzzle of all. Hoppo has a crush on Bumblelion, but Bumblelion has his heart set on Butterbear.
* Rhinokey (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer): Half rhinoceros and half monkey, Rhinokey is mostly monkey in appearance. Rhinokey is a Wuzzle who has a rhino-like snout with a horizontal-striped horn, pink fur, and rhino-like legs. He is in a posture that is very much like that of a monkey&#x27;s. Rhinokey is a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky prankster. He loves to play practical jokes. He can be obnoxious, particularly with Hoppopotamus, but he loves his friends. He and Moosel are best friends.

===Antagonists===
* Crocosaurus (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer): Half crocodile and half dinosaur, and the main antagonist of the series. Crocosaurus (normally referred to as Crock in the series) is bad-tempered, lazy, vile, ignorant, a bully, and does anything to get what he wants. He always wants the best of what the other Wuzzles have, but does not want to apply the effort to acquire it himself.
* Brat (voiced by Bill Scott): Half wild boar, half dragon, and Crocosaurus&#x27;s chief sidekick. Brat sputters, raspberries, cries, laughs, yells, growls, and grunts in his speech, but Crocosaurus always understands what he is saying. Like Crocosaurus, he is very lazy and has a strong dislike towards the other Wuzzles coupled with a desire to have the best of what they have without applying any effort towards acquiring it. As his name implies, Brat is very bad-tempered and is often shown throwing tantrums when he does not get his own way. He is also greatly lacking in intelligence, and his incompetence often sees himself and Crocosaurus falling victim to their own devices, which in turn occasionally sees the two of them falling out.
* Flizard (voiced by Brian Cummings): Half frog, half lizard, and Crocosaurus&#x27;s other sidekick. Flizard is not particularly intelligent, but he means well, is more amiable in his manner than either Crocosaurus or Brat, and relatively more tolerant of the Wuzzles, but nevertheless very loyal to Crocosaurus; on occasions where Crocosaurus and Brat fall out, it is often up to Flizard to try and patch things up between them. His character essentially emphasizes tolerance of others whom one is not particularly close to, while staying loyal to one&#x27;s friends regardless of whether their plans are morally right or not. Flizard does not appear in every episode, only making sporadic appearances throughout the series.

Butterbear and Rhinokey appeared in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode &quot;The Lost Cargo of Kit Cloudkicker!&quot; Unlike their original TV series&#x27; appearances, their designs are more realistic and animalistic and Rhinokey resembles a gorilla instead of a monkey. Additionally, they were created by a relic called the Stone of What Was, which bears Bumblelion&#x27;s likeness and fuses any two animals that touch it into one chimeric monstrosity.

<text>Muqtada al-Sadr (; born 4 August 1974) is an Iraqi Shia Muslim cleric, politician and militia leader. He inherited the leadership of the Sadrist Movement from his father, and founded the now dissolved Mahdi Army militia in 2003 that resisted the American occupation of Iraq. He also founded the Promised Day Brigade insurgent group after the dissolution of the Mahdi Army; both were backed by Iran. In 2014, he founded the Peace Companies militia and serves as its current head. In 2018, he joined his Sadrist political party to the Saairun alliance, which won the highest number of seats in the 2018 and 2021 Iraqi parliamentary elections.

== Titles ==
He belongs to the prominent al-Sadr family that hails from Jabal Amel in Lebanon, before later settling in Najaf. Sadr is the son of Muhammad al-Sadr, an Iraqi religious figure and politician who stood against Saddam Hussein, and the nephew of Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr. He is often styled with the honorific title &quot;Sayyid&quot;.

His formal religious standing within the Shi&#x27;i clerical hierarchy is comparatively mid-ranking. As a result of this, in 2008 Sadr claimed for himself neither the title of &quot;mujtahid&quot; (the equivalent of a senior religious scholar) nor the authority to issue any fatwas. In early 2008, he was reported to be studying to be an ayatollah, something that would greatly improve his religious standing.

== Family ==
Muqtada al-Sadr is the fourth son of a famous Iraqi Shia cleric, the late Grand Ayatollah Muhammad al-Sadr. He is also the son-in-law of Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr. Both were revered for their concern for the poor.

Muqtada is a citizen of Iraq; his great-grandfather is Ismail as-Sadr. Mohammed Sadeq al-Sadr, Muqtada al-Sadr&#x27;s father, was a respected figure throughout the Shi&#x27;a Islamic world. He was murdered, along with two of his sons, allegedly by the government of Saddam Hussein. Muqtada&#x27;s father-in-law was executed by the Iraqi authorities in 1980. Muqtada is a cousin of the disappeared Musa al-Sadr, the Iranian-Lebanese founder of the popular Amal Movement.

In 1994, Sadr married one of Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr&#x27;s daughters. As of 2008, he had no children.

== Political positions ==
Muqtada al-Sadr gained popularity in Iraq following the toppling of the Saddam government by the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Sadr has on occasion stated that he wishes to create an &quot;Islamic democracy&quot;.

Sadr commands strong support (especially in the Sadr City district in Baghdad, formerly named &quot;Saddam City&quot; but renamed after the elder Sadr). After the fall of the Saddam government in 2003, Muqtada al-Sadr organized thousands of his supporters into a political movement, which includes a military wing formerly known as the &quot;Jaysh al-Mahdi&quot; or Mahdi Army. The name refers to the Mahdi, a long-since disappeared Imam who is believed by Shi&#x27;as to be due to reappear when the end of time approaches. This group periodically engaged in violent conflict with the United States and other Coalition forces, while the larger Sadrist movement has formed its own religious courts and organized social services, law enforcement and prisons in areas under its control. Western media often referred to Muqtada al-Sadr as an &quot;anti-American&quot; or &quot;radical&quot; cleric.

His strongest support came from the class of dispossessed Shi&#x27;a, like in the Sadr City area of Baghdad. Many Iraqi supporters see in him a symbol of resistance to foreign occupation. The Mahdi army was reported to have operated death squads during the Iraqi Civil War.

In a statement received by AFP on 15 February 2014, Sadr announced the closure of all offices, centers and associations affiliated with Al-Shaheed Al-Sadr, his father, inside and outside Iraq, and announced his non-intervention in all political affairs, adding that no bloc will represent the movement inside or outside the government or parliament. Several times he has called for all paramilitary groups recognised by the Iraqi state to be dissolved after the complete defeat of ISIL and that all foreign forces (including Iran) then leave Iraqi territory. He surprised many when he visited the crown princes of both Saudi Arabia, for the first time in 11 years, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2017 and earlier and was criticized in some Iranian circles. In April 2017, he distinguished himself from other Iraqi Shiite leaders in calling on Iranian-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down and save the country from more bloodshed. Sadr&#x27;s efforts to strengthen relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq mirror those of former Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.

Muqtada is widely suspected of ordering numerous assassinations against high-ranking Shi&#x27;ite clergy, including a 2003 bombing of the house of Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Saeed al-Hakim, and the 10 April 2003 murder of Grand Ayatollah Abdul-Majid al-Khoei at a mosque in Najaf. On 13 October 2003, fighting broke out in Karbala, when al-Sadr&#x27;s men attacked supporters of moderate Shi&#x27;ite Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani near the Imam Hussein shrine.

==Opposition to US presence==
=== 2003 ===
Shortly after the US-led coalition ousted Saddam Hussein and his Ba&#x27;ath regime, al-Sadr voiced opposition to the Coalition Provisional Authority. He subsequently stated that he had more legitimacy than the Coalition-appointed Iraqi Governing Council. He granted his first major Western television interview to Bob Simon of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, in which al-Sadr famously said &quot;Saddam was the little serpent, but America is the big serpent.&quot;

In May 2003, al-Sadr issued a fatwa that became known as the &quot;al-Hawasim&quot; (meaning &#x27;the finalists&#x27; – a term used to refer to the looters of post-invasion Iraq) &quot;fatwa&quot;. The fatwa allowed theft and racketeering on the condition that the perpetrators pay the requisite khums to Sadrist imams, saying that &quot;looters could hold on to what they had appropriated so long as they made a donation (khums) of one-fifth of its value to their local Sadrist office.&quot; The fatwa alienated many older members of his father&#x27;s movement, as well as mainstream Shiites, and the Shia establishment and property-owning classes from the Sadrists. However, the fatwa strengthened his popularity among the poorest members of society, notably in Sadr City. It has been claimed that the original fatwa was actually issued by Sadr&#x27;s advisor Grand Ayatollah Kazem Husseini Haeri, and that al-Sadr was simply loyally issuing the same instruction.

Al-Sadr is suspected in US news media of having ordered the assassination of rival Shia leader Abdul-Majid al-Khoei in 2003, a charge he denies and which remains unproven.

=== 2004 ===
In his 2004 sermons and public interviews, al-Sadr repeatedly demanded an immediate withdrawal of all US-led coalition forces, all foreign troops under United Nations control, and the establishment of a new central Iraqi government, not connected to the Ba&#x27;ath party or the Allawi government.

In late March 2004, American authorities (759th MP Battalion) in Iraq shut down Sadr&#x27;s newspaper &quot;al-Hawza&quot; on charges of inciting violence. Sadr&#x27;s followers held demonstrations protesting the closure of the newspaper. On 4 April, fighting broke out in Najaf, Sadr City, and Basra. Sadr&#x27;s Mahdi Army took over several points and attacked coalition soldiers, killing dozens of foreign soldiers, and taking many casualties of their own in the process. At the same time, Sunni rebels in the cities of Baghdad, Samarra, Ramadi, and, most notably, Fallujah, staged uprisings as well, causing the most serious challenge to American control of Iraq up to that time.

During the first siege of Fallujah in late March and April 2004, Muqtada&#x27;s Sadrists sent aid convoys to the besieged Sunnis there.

Paul Bremer, then the US administrator in Iraq, declared on 5 April 2004 that al-Sadr was an outlaw and that uprisings by his followers would not be tolerated.

That day, al-Sadr called for a jihad against American forces. To do this he needed to gain temporary control of Al Kut, An Najaf and the suburb of Baghdad named after his grandfather, Sadr City. On the night of 8 April, his Mahdi Army dropped eight overspans and bridges around the Convoy Support Center Scania, thus severing northbound traffic into Baghdad. The next day his militia ambushed any and every convoy trying to get in or out of Baghdad International Airport, known to the soldiers as BIAP. This led to the worst convoy ambush of the war, the ambush of the 724th Transportation Company (POL), which resulted in eight KBR drivers killed and three soldiers killed. One was Matt Maupin, who was initially listed as the first American soldier missing in action. These series of attacks demonstrated an unexpected level of sophistication in planning. The Mahdi Army knew it could not win a head on fight with the United States military coalition and it took full advantage of a major American vulnerability by attacking convoy trucks that supplied the troops. BIAP was where the newly arrived 1st Cavalry Division drew its supplies. The 1st Cavalry Division was replacing the 1st Armored Division in and around Baghdad. The 1st Armored Division had already been deployed to Iraq for a year. CENTCOM commander General John Abizaid decided to extend the Division beyond its 1-year deployment, for an additional 120 days, to use in the fight against the Mahdi Army. On 11 April, the Mahdi Army launched an attack on the southwest wall at BIAP behind which several hundred trucks parked. By the end of April, the American 1st Armored Division had suppressed the Mahdi Army&#x27;s uprising but al Sadr had achieved his goal of making it a significant resistance force fighting against the U.S. led coalition forces occupying Iraq.

=== 2005–2006 ===
It is generally frowned upon in Iraq for clerics to actively participate in secular politics, and like the other leading religious figures, Muqtada al-Sadr did not run in the 2005 Iraqi elections. It is believed he implicitly backed the National Independent Cadres and Elites party that was closely linked with the Mahdi Army. Many of his supporters, however, backed the far more popular United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) of Grand Ayatollah Sistani.

On 26 August 2005, an estimated 100,000 Iraqis marched in support of al-Sadr and his ideals.

On 25 March 2006, Sadr was in his home and escaped a mortar attack; this attack was disputed, as the ordnance landed more than 50 meters from his home.

Sadr&#x27;s considerable leverage was apparent early in the week of 16 October 2006, when Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki ordered the release of one of Sadr&#x27;s senior aides. The aide had been arrested a day earlier by American troops on suspicion of participating in kidnappings and killings.

=== 2007 ===
On 13 February, several sources in the US government claimed that Muqtada al-Sadr had left Iraq and fled to Iran in anticipation of the coming security crackdown. US military spokesman Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell reinforced this account on 14 February, but a member of Iraq&#x27;s parliament and an aide to al-Sadr have denied the claims.

On 30 March it was reported that Sadr, through clerics speaking on his behalf, &quot;delivered a searing speech ... condemning the American presence in Iraq ... [and] call[ing] for an anti-occupation mass protest on April 9.&quot; This call to protest was significant in that, since the beginning of the American troop surge (which began on 14 February 2007), al-Sadr had ordered his &quot;militia to lie low during the new Baghdad security plan so as not to provoke a direct confrontation with the Americans&quot;.

In a statement stamped with Sadr&#x27;s official seal and distributed in the Shiite holy city of Najaf a day before the demonstration, on Sunday, 8 April 2007, Muqtada al-Sadr urged the Iraqi army and police to stop cooperating with the United States and told his guerilla fighters to concentrate on pushing American forces out of the country. &quot;You, the Iraqi army and police forces, don&#x27;t walk alongside the occupiers, because they are your arch-enemy,&quot; the statement said.

On 17 April 2007, several ministers loyal to al-Sadr left the Iraqi government. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated that the withdrawal of these ministers had not weakened his government and that he would name technocrats to replace them soon.

On 25 April 2007, Sadr condemned the construction of Azamiyah wall around a Sunni neighbourhood in Baghdad, by calling for demonstrations against the plan as a sign of &quot;the evil will&quot; of American &quot;occupiers&quot;

On 25 May 2007, Sadr delivered a sermon to an estimated 6,000 followers in Kufa. Sadr reiterated his condemnation of the United States&#x27; occupation of Iraq and demanded the withdrawal of foreign forces, al-Sadr&#x27;s speech also contained calls for unity between Sunni and Shi&#x27;a. In June 2007, al-Sadr vowed to go ahead with a planned march to the devastated Askariyya shrine in central Iraq, al-Sadr said the march was aimed at bringing Shi&#x27;is and Sunnis closer together and breaking down the barriers imposed by the Americans and Sunni religious extremists.

In a statement issued 29 August 2007, Muqtada al-Sadr announced that an order to stand down for six months had been distributed to his loyalists following the deaths of more than 50 Shia Muslim pilgrims during fighting in Karbala the day before. The statement issued by Sadr&#x27;s office in Najaf said: &quot;I direct the Mahdi army to suspend all its activities for six months until it is restructured in a way that helps honour the principles for which it is formed.&quot; The intention behind the ceasefire was thought in part to be to allow al-Sadr reassert control over the movement, which is thought to have splintered. &quot;We call on all Sadrists to observe self-restraint, to help security forces control the situation and arrest the perpetrators and sedition mongers, and urge them to end all forms of armament in the sacred city,&quot; said the statement, referring to the 28 August clashes in Karbala. Asked if the unexpected order meant no attacks on American troops, as well as a ban on Shia infighting, a senior Sadr aide said: &quot;All kinds of armed actions are to be frozen, without exception.&quot;

=== 2008–2011 ===
In March 2008, during the Battle of Basra, the Sadr Movement launched a nationwide civil disobedience campaign across Iraq to protest raids and detentions against the Mahdi Army.

In August 2008, Sadr ordered most of his militiamen to disarm but said he will maintain elite fighting units to resist the Americans if a timetable for the withdrawal of US troops is not established. &quot;Weapons are to be exclusively in the hands of one group, the resistance group,&quot; while another group called &quot;Momahidoun&quot; is to focus on social, religious and community work, Sadrist cleric Mudhafar al-Moussawi said.

In response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, al-Sadr called for reprisals against US troops in Iraq: &quot;I call upon the honest Iraqi resistance to carry out revenge operations against the great accomplice of the Zionist enemy.&quot;

On 1 May 2009, al-Sadr paid a surprise visit to Ankara where, in his first public appearance for two years, he met with Turkish President Abdullah Gül and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for talks that focused on the &quot;political process&quot; and requested Turkey play a greater role in establishing stability in the Middle East. Spokesman Sheikh Salah al-Obeidi confirmed the nature of the talks that had been requested by al-Sadr and stated, &quot;Turkey is a good, old friend. Trusting that, we had no hesitation in travelling here.&quot; After the meeting al-Sadr visited supporters in Istanbul, where al-Obeidi says they may open a representative office.

In a press conference on 6 March 2010, ahead of the 2010 Iraqi parliamentary election, Sadr called on all Iraqis to participate in the election and support those who seek to expel US troops out of the country. Sadr warned that any interference by the United States will be unacceptable.

On 5 January 2011, Sadr returned to the Iraqi city of Najaf in order to take a more proactive and visible role in the new Iraqi government. Three days later, thousands of Iraqis turned out in Najaf to hear his first speech since his return, in which he called the US, Israel, and the UK &quot;common enemies&quot; against Iraq. His speech was greeted by the crowd chanting &quot;Yes, yes for Muqtada! Yes, yes for the leader!&quot; while waving Iraqi flags and al-Sadr&#x27;s pictures. Subsequently, he returned to Iran to continue his studies.

By late 2011, it appeared that the United States would largely withdraw from Iraq, a demand that helped make Sadr a popular leader amongst supporters almost immediately following the invasion. Sadr also controlled the largest bloc of parliament, and had reached a sort of détente with prime minister Nouri al Maliki, who needed Sadrist support to retain his post.

==Post-US withdrawal==
===2011–2020===
On 5 January 2011, Sadr returned from Iran, to Najaf, having spent four years out of the country after vowing never to return unless the American military forces left. 
Prior to his arrival in Najaf, he had been instrumental in the formation of the 2011 Iraqi government.

Following the US withdrawal from Iraq, Sadr continued to be an influential figure in Iraqi politics, associated with the Al-Ahrar bloc, whose Shi&#x27;a factions are still at war with not only the government but also the Sunni factions. However, whereas during the war al-Sadr was known for advocating violence, in 2012 he began to present himself as a proponent of moderation and tolerance and called for peace. According to Britannica, &quot;although Sadr himself was once an image of Iraqi Shiʿi militancy, he came to see sectarianism as a source of dysfunction and corruption in government and began steering his supporters away from sectarianism.&quot;

In February 2014, Sadr announced that he was withdrawing from politics and dissolving the party structure to protect his family&#x27;s reputation.

However, later in 2014, he called for the formation of &quot;Peace Companies&quot;, often mistranslated &quot;Peace Brigades&quot;, to protect Shia shrines from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In June, these Peace Companies marched in Sadr City. In addition to guarding shrines, the Peace Companies participated in offensive operations such as the recapture of Jurf al-Nasr in October 2014. They suspended their activities temporarily in February 2015, but were active in the Second Battle of Tikrit in March.

Sadr is considered a populist by Western observers. In 2015 he entered into an alliance with the Iraqi Communist Party and other secular groups &quot;under an umbrella of security and corruption concerns&quot;, both long-standing issues of daily life in the country. In March 2015, Sadr criticized the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying that &quot;It [Saudi invasion of Yemen] is at odds with Islamic-Arabic unity&quot;.
On 26 February 2016, Sadr led a one million-strong demonstration in Baghdad&#x27;s Tahrir Square to protest corruption in Iraq and the government&#x27;s failure to deliver on reforms. &quot;Abadi must carry out grassroots reform,&quot; Sadr said in front of the protesters. &quot;Raise your voice and shout so the corrupt get scared of you,&quot; he encouraged the people. On 18 March, Sadr&#x27;s followers began a sit-in outside the Green Zone, a heavily fortified district in Baghdad housing government offices and embassies. He called the Green Zone &quot;a bastion of support for corruption&quot;. On 27 March, he walked into the Green Zone to begin a sit-in, urging followers to stay outside and remain peaceful. He met with Abadi on 26 December to discuss the reform project he proposed during protests early in the year. Following the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack in Syria on 4 April 2017, Sadr called for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to step down. In July 2017, Sadr visited Saudi Arabia and met Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.

In 2017 he condemned the Trump administration&#x27;s open support of Israeli claims about Jerusalem and advocated the closure of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad due to American announcements related to their forthcoming embassy move in Israel which he saw as a &#x27;declaration of war on Islam.&#x27;

In April 2018, Sadr wrote: &quot;I am ready to intervene between the Islamic Republic (Iran) and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to resolve some issues, even gradually, and that is for nothing but the best of Iraq and the region.&quot;

In May 2018, Sadr&#x27;s Sairoon electoral list won 54 seats in the first Iraqi parliamentary election since the Islamic State was declared defeated in Iraq. He rejected U.S. interference in the formation of the new Iraqi government, saying: &quot;The U.S. is an invader country; we do not allow it to interfere&quot; in Iraqi affairs.&quot; In a country riven by sectarian tensions and regional politics, Sadr has transformed himself again: He has now positioned himself as an Iraqi nationalist; his newly formed Istiqāmah (&quot;Integrity&quot;) Party allied himself with communists and smaller groups including Sunnis, secularists, liberals, and political independents; criticized, corruption, Iran&#x27;s outsized influence in Iraq; and strongly criticized the sectarian nature of Iraq&#x27;s politics. Following the May 2018 elections the son of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and General Soleimani lobbied Sadr and others to forge a political coalition allied with Tehran.

After months of winning parliamentary elections, Sadr favored the return of Iraqi Jews to Iraq, which received positively by majority of the Iraqis.

On 7 December 2019, an armed drone attack targeted Sadr&#x27;s home in Baghdad. Sadr was out of the country at the time; the attack caused little damage and no casualties.

After the assassination of Qasem Soleimani in January 2020 and the Iraqi parliament&#x27;s resolution favouring expulsion of US troops, the Iraqi Shia leader called for &quot;the immediate cancellation of the security agreement with the US, the closure of the US embassy, the expulsion of US troops in a &#x27;humiliating manner&#x27;, and criminalizing communication with the US government&quot;. Following the 8 January 2020 Iranian rocket attacks on US led military bases, however, Sadr held back and urged his followers not to attack U.S. elements in Iraq.

On 25 December 2020, Sadr warned Iran and the United States not to involve Iraq in their conflict.

===2021–present===

On 13 June 2022, 73 MPs from Sadr’s bloc resigned from parliament amid the 2022 Iraqi political crisis.

On August 29, 2022, Sadr announced his retirement from Iraq politics and the closure of most of his offices and institutions.

In May 2024, Sadr called for the closure of the US embassy in Baghdad following Israeli airstrikes on the Tel al-Sultan refugee camp in Gaza.

On 5 December 2024, Sadr posted a message on Twitter urging &quot;Iraq&#x27;s government, people, parties, militias and security forces&quot; not to intervene in Syria amid the collapse of government forces due to a rebel offensive launched in late November.

<text>Henry Chichele ( , also Checheley; – 12 April 1443) was Archbishop of Canterbury (1414–1443) and founded All Souls College, Oxford.

==Early life==
Chichele was born at Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, in 1363 or 1364; Chichele told Pope Eugene IV, in 1443, in asking leave to retire from the archbishopric, that he was in his eightieth year. He was the third and youngest son of Thomas Chichele, who appears in 1368 in extant town records of Higham Ferrers, as a suitor in the mayor&#x27;s court, and in 1381–1382, and again in 1384–1385, was mayor: in fact, for a dozen years he and Henry Barton, schoolmaster of Higham Ferrers grammar school, and one Richard Brabazon, filled the mayoralty in turns.

Thomas Chichele&#x27;s occupation does not appear but his eldest son, William, is on the earliest extant list (1383) of the Grocers&#x27; Company in London. On 9 June 1405 Henry Chichele was admitted, in succession to his father, to a burgage in Higham Ferrers. His mother, Agnes Pincheon, is said to have been of gentle birth. There is therefore no foundation in fact for the account (copied into the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; from a local historian, John Cole, Wellingborough, 1838) that he was picked up, as a poor ploughboy &quot;eating his scanty meal off his mother&#x27;s lap&quot;, by William of Wykeham. This story was unknown to Arthur Duck, Fellow of All Souls, who wrote Chichele&#x27;s life in 1617.

===Education===
The first recorded appearance of Chichele himself is at New College, Oxford, as &quot;Checheley&quot;, eighth among the undergraduate fellows, in July 1387, in the earliest extant hall-book, which contains weekly lists of those dining in Hall. It is often claimed that he was one of the earliest scholars of Winchester College, which was historically the sole feeder of New College. However, Winchester was not operational until 1394, by which time Chichele had already left Winchester and Oxford, and he does not feature in the College&#x27;s complete &quot;Register of Scholars&quot;. He probably did study under William of Wykeham in Winchester, although not as a scholar of Winchester College, and for this reason can be considered an Old Wykehamist.

Chichele appears in the Hall-books of New College up to the year 1392/93, when he was a B.A. and was absent for ten weeks from about 6 December to 6 March, presumably for the purpose of his ordination as a sub-deacon, which was performed by the bishop of Derry, acting as suffragan to the bishop of London. He was then already beneficed, receiving a royal ratification of his estate as parson of Llanvarchell in the diocese of St Asaph on 20 March 1391/92 (&quot;Cat. Pat. Rolls&quot;). 

==Career==

===Legal career===
In the Hall-book, marked 1393/94, but really for 1394/95, Chichele&#x27;s name does not appear. He had then left the University of Oxford and gone up to London to practise as an advocate in the principal ecclesiastical court, the Court of Arches. His rise was rapid. Already on 8 February 1395/96 he was, on a commission with several knights and clerks to hear an appeal in a case of John Molton, Esquire v. John Shawe, citizen of London, from Sir John Cheyne kt., sitting for the constable of England in a court of chivalry.

Like other ecclesiastical lawyers and civil servants of the day Chichele was paid with ecclesiastical preferments. On 13 April 1396, he obtained ratification of the parsonage of St Stephen Walbrook, presented on 30 March by the abbot of Colchester, no doubt through his brother Robert, who restored the church and increased its endowment. In 1397 he was made archdeacon of Dorset by Richard Mitford, bishop of Salisbury, but litigation was still going on about it in the papal court until 27 June 1399, when the pope extinguished the suit, imposing perpetual silence on Nicholas Bubwith, master of the rolls, his opponent. In the first year of Henry IV Chichele was parson of Sherston, Wiltshire, and prebendary of Nantgwyly in the college of Abergwili, Wales; on 23 February 1401/2, now called doctor of laws, he was pardoned for bringing in, and allowed to use, a bull of the pope providing to him the chancellorship of Salisbury Cathedral, and canonries in the nuns&#x27; churches of Shaftesbury and Wilton in that diocese; and on 9 January 1402/3 he was archdeacon of Salisbury.

===Royal service===
This year his brother Robert Chichele was senior sheriff of London. On 7 May 1404, Pope Boniface IX provided him to a prebend at Lincoln, notwithstanding he already held prebends at Salisbury, Lichfield, St Martins-le-Grand and Abergwyly, and the living of Brington. On 9 January 1405 he found time to attend a court at Higham Ferrers and be admitted to a burgage there. In July 1405 Chichele began a diplomatic career by a mission to the new Roman Pope Innocent VII, who was professing his desire to end the schism in the papacy by resignation, if his French rival at Avignon would do likewise. Next year, on 5 October 1406, he was sent with Sir John Cheyne to Paris to arrange a lasting peace and the marriage of Prince Henry with the French princess Marie, which was frustrated by her becoming a nun at Poissy next year. 

In 1406 renewed efforts were made to stop the schism, and Chichele was one of the envoys sent to the new Pope Gregory XII. Here he utilised his opportunities. On 31 August 1407 Guy Mone (he is always so spelt and not Mohun, and was probably from one of the Hampshire Meons; there was a John Mone of Havant admitted a Winchester scholar in 1397), Bishop of St Davids, died, and on 12 October 1407 Chichele was by the pope provided to the bishopric of St Davids. Another bull the same day gave him the right to hold all his benefices with the bishopric. He was consecrated on 17 June 1408.

At Siena in July 1408 he and Sir John Cheyne, as English envoys, were received by Gregory XII with special honour, and Bishop Repingdon of Lincoln, ex-Wycliffite, was one of the new batch of cardinals created on 18 September 1408, most of Gregory&#x27;s cardinals having deserted him. These, together with Benedict&#x27;s revolting cardinals, summoned a general council at Pisa. In November 1408 Chichele was back at Westminster, when Henry IV received the cardinal archbishop of Bordeaux and determined to support the cardinals at Pisa against both popes. In January 1409 Chichele was named with Bishop Hallam of Salisbury and the prior of Canterbury to represent the Southern Convocation at the council, which opened on 25 March 1409, arriving on 24 April. Obedience was withdrawn from both the existing popes, and on 26 June a new pope elected instead of them.

Chichele and the other envoys were received on their return as saviours of the world; though the result was summed up by a contemporary as trischism instead of schism, and the Church as giving three husbands instead of two. Chichele now became the subject of a leading case, the court of kings bench deciding, after arguments reheard in three successive terms, that he could not hold his previous benefices with the bishopric, and that, spite of the maxim &quot;Papa potest omnia&quot;, a papal bull could not supersede the law of the land (&quot;Year-book ii.&quot; H. iv. 37, 59, 79). Accordingly, he had to resign livings and canonries (28 April 1410). As, however, he had obtained a bull (20 August 1409) enabling him to appoint his successors to the vacated preferments, including his nephew William, though still an undergraduate and not in orders, to the chancellorship of Salisbury, and a prebend at Lichfield, he did not go empty away. In May 1410 he went again on an embassy to France; on 11 September 1411 he headed a mission to discuss Henry V&#x27;s marriage with a daughter of the duke of Burgundy; and he was again there in November.

In the interval Chichele found time to visit his diocese for the first time and be enthroned at St Davids on 11 May 1411. He was with the English force under the earl of Arundel which accompanied the duke of Burgundy to Paris in October 1411 and there defeated the Armagnacs, an exploit which revealed to England the weakness of the French. On 30 November 1411 Chichele, with two other bishops and three earls and the prince of Wales, knelt to the king to receive public thanks for their administration. That he was in high favour with Henry V is shown by his being sent with Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick (1382–1439) to France in July 1413 to conclude peace. Immediately after the death of Thomas Arundel Archbishop of Canterbury the king recommended him to the pope for promotion to the archbishopric on 13 March 1414, signified his royal assent of Chichele&#x27;s postulation on 23 March 1414, translated by papal bull on 28 April 1414, and received the pall without going to Rome for it on 24 July.

These dates are important as they help to save Chichele from the charge, versified by Shakespeare (&quot;Henry V&quot;. act 1. sc. 2) from Hall&#x27;s Chronicle, of having tempted Henry V into the conquest of France for the sake of diverting parliament from the disendowment of the Church. There is no contemporary authority for the charge, which seems to appear first in Redman&#x27;s rhetorical history of Henry V, written in 1540 with an eye to the political situation at that time, As a matter of fact, the parliament at Leicester, in which the speeches were supposed to have been made, began on 30 April 1414 before Chichele was archbishop. The rolls of parliament show that he was not present in the parliament at all. Moreover, parliament was so far from pressing disendowment that on the petition of the House of Commons it passed a savage act against the heresies commonly called Lollardy which aimed at the destruction of the king and all temporal estates, making Lollards felons and ordering every justice of the peace to hunt down their schools, conventicles, congregations and confederacies.

===Later career===
In his capacity of archbishop, Chichele remained what he had always been chiefly, the lawyer and diplomatist. He was present at the siege of Rouen, and the king committed to him personally the negotiations for the surrender of the city in January 1419 and for the marriage of Katherine. He crowned Katherine at Westminster (20 February 1421), and on 6 December baptised her child Henry VI. He was a persecutor of heretics. No one could have attained or kept the position of archbishop at the time without being so. He presided at the trial of John Claydon, skinner and citizen of London, who after five years imprisonment at various times had made public abjuration before the late archbishop, Arundel, but now was found in possession of a book in English called &quot;The Lanterne of Light&quot;, which contained the heresy that the principal cause of the persecution of Christians was the illegal retention by priests of the goods of this world, and that archbishops and bishops were the special seats of Antichrist. As a relapsed heretic, he was left to the secular arm by Chichele, which resulted in burning at Smithfield.

On 1 July 1416 Chichele directed a half-yearly inquisition by archdeacons to hunt out heretics. On 12 February 1420 proceedings were begun before him against William Taylor, priest, who had been excommunicated 14 years earlier for heresy. Though Chichele absolved Taylor of the charges, Taylor was brought before him again on 11 February 1423 for saying that prayers ought not to be addressed to saints, but only to God. This time, he was found guilty of heresy by Bishop Chichele and executed by burning . A striking contrast was exhibited in October 1424, when a Stamford friar, John Russell, who had preached that any religious &quot;potest concumbere cum muliere&quot; and not mortally sin, was sentenced only to retract his doctrine.

In 1422, in Higham Ferrers, he established a college called &quot;Chichele College&quot; for secular canons. The College had provision for 8 priests, 4 clerks, 6 choristers and a song and grammar master.

Further persecutions of a number of Lollards took place in 1428. The records of convocation in Chichele&#x27;s time are a curious mixture of persecutions for heresy, which largely consisted in attacks on clerical endowments, with negotiations with the ministers of the crown for the object of cutting down to the lowest level the clerical contributions to the public revenues in respect of their endowments. Chichele was tenacious of the privileges of his see, and this involved him in a constant struggle with Henry Beaufort, bishop of Winchester. In 1418, while Henry V was alive, he successfully protested against Beaufort&#x27;s being made a cardinal and legate a latere to supersede the legatine jurisdiction of Canterbury. But during the regency, after Henry VI&#x27;s accession, Beaufort was successful, and in 1426 became cardinal and legate.

==Relations with the papacy==
This brought Chichele into collision with Martin V. The struggle between them has been represented as one of a patriotic archbishop resisting the encroachments of the papacy on the Church of England. In point of fact it was almost wholly personal, and was rather an incident in the rivalry between the Duke of Gloucester and his half-uncle, Cardinal Beaufort, than one involving any principle. Chichele, by appointing a jubilee to be held at Canterbury in 1420, after the manner of the Jubilee ordained by the Popes, threatened to divert the profits from pilgrims from Rome to Canterbury. A ferocious letter from the pope to the papal nuncios, on 19 March 1423, denounced the proceeding as calculated to ensnare simple souls and extort from them a profane reward, thereby setting up themselves against the apostolic see and the Roman pontiff, to whom alone so great a faculty has been granted by God (&quot;Cat. Pap. Reg.&quot; vii. 12). Chichele also incurred the papal wrath by opposing the system of papal provision which diverted patronage from English to Italian hands, but the immediate occasion was to prevent the introduction of the bulls making Beaufort a cardinal. Chichele had been careful enough to obtain Papal provisions for himself, his pluralities, his bishopric and archbishopric.

==Educational foundations==
In addition to his accomplishments as an archbishop and statesman, Chichele is remembered for his educational foundations. He endowed a &quot;hutch&quot; (chest or loan-fund) for poor scholars at New College, and another for the University of Oxford at large. He founded three colleges: two at Oxford, one at Higham Ferrers. His first college at Oxford was St Bernard&#x27;s College, founded by Chichele under licence in mortmain in 1437 for Cistercian monks, on the model of Gloucester Hall and Durham College for the southern and northern Benedictines. Nothing more than a site and building was required by way of endowment, as the young monks, who were sent there to study under a provisor, were supported by the houses of the order to which they belonged. The site was five acres, and the building is described in the letters patent &quot;as a fitting and noble college mansion in honour of the most glorious Virgin Mary and St Bernard in Northgates Street outside the Northgate of Oxford.&quot; It was suppressed with the Cistercian abbeys in 1540, and, on 11 December 1546, granted to Christ Church, Oxford, which sold it to Thomas White in 1554 for St John&#x27;s College, Oxford.

The college at Higham Ferrers was a much earlier design. On 2 May 1422, Henry V granted for 300 marks (£200) licence to found, on three acres at Higham Ferrers, a perpetual college of eight chaplains and four clerks, of whom one was to teach grammar and the other song. A papal bull having also been obtained, the archbishop, in the course of a visitation of Lincoln diocese, executed his letters patent founding the college, dedicating it to the Virgin Mary, St Thomas à Becket and St Edward the Confessor, and handed over the buildings to its members, the vicar of Higham Ferrers being made the first master or warden. He further endowed it in 1434 with lands in Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire, and his brothers, William and Robert, gave some houses in London in 1427 and 1438. The foundation was closely modelled on Winchester College, with its warden and fellows, its grammar and song schoolmasters, but a step in advance was made by the masters being made fellows and so members of the governing body. Attached was also a bede or almshouse for twelve poor men. Both school and almshouse had existed before, and this was merely an additional endowment. The endowment was in 1535 worth some £200 a year, about a fifth of that of Winchester College. The college at Higham Ferrers fell with other colleges not part of the universities. On 18 July 1542 it was surrendered to Henry VIII, and its possessions granted to Robert Dacres on condition of maintaining the grammar school and paying the master £10 a year, the same salary as the headmasters of Winchester and Eton, and maintaining the almshouse.

All Souls College, Oxford was considerably later. The patent for it, dated 20 May 1438, is for a warden and 20 scholars. A papal bull for the college was obtained on 21 June 1439, and further patents for endowments from May 1441 to January 1443. Early in 1443, not long before his death, Chichele opened the college.

==Death==
Chichele died on 12 April 1443. He is buried in Canterbury Cathedral, in a &quot;cadaver tomb&quot; between the upper choir and the choir ambulatory, adjacent to the north-east transept. The neighbouring gateway, from the transept into the choir, is known as the &quot;Chichele Gate&quot;. His elaborate and colourful tomb, built years before his death, depicts his naked corpse on the lower level, while on the upper level he is depicted resplendent in archiepiscopal vesture, his palms together in prayer. &quot;I was pauper-born,&quot; reads the inscription on his tomb, &quot;then to primate raised. Now I am cut down and served up for worms. Behold my grave.&quot;

<text>Christopher John Spedding (born Peter Robinson, 17 June 1944) is an English guitarist and record producer. In a career spanning more than 50 years, Spedding is best known for his studio session work. By the early 1970s, he had become one of the most sought-after session guitarists in England. Spedding has played on and produced many albums and singles. He has also been a member of eleven rock bands: the Battered Ornaments, Frank Ricotti Quartet, King Mob, Mike Batt and Friends, Necessaries, Nucleus, Ricky Norton, Sharks, Trigger, and the Wombles. In May 1976, Spedding also produced the first Sex Pistols recordings.

AllMusic has described Spedding as &quot;one of the UK&#x27;s most versatile session guitarists, [he] has had a long career on two continents that saw him tackle nearly every style of rock and 

Spedding, a long-time friend of Chrissie Hynde, was a regular concert feature artist with the Pretenders on their US tour in March/April 1980. He appeared regularly during the band&#x27;s encores, playing the guitar solos on their version of the Kinks&#x27; song &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot;.

As well as his celebrated work as a session musician, Spedding pursued a solo career, releasing his debut album &quot;Songs Without Words&quot; in 1970. Since then, he has released fourteen studio albums, and two live albums. His only solo hit was 1975&#x27;s &quot;Motor Bikin.

==Career==
Chris Spedding was born in Staveley, Derbyshire, but was raised in Sheffield and Birmingham by adoptive parents Muriel and Jack Spedding, and renamed Christopher John Spedding.

Whilst still with the Battered Ornaments, which without the departing Pete Brown left Spedding as their frontman, he joined the Frank Ricotti Quartet, and played guitar on the album &quot;Our Point of View&quot;, released in July 1969. He was also invited to play on Jack Bruce&#x27;s first and third solo albums, &quot;Songs for a Tailor&quot; (1969) and &quot;Harmony Row&quot; (1971).

Spedding then recorded his own instrumental album, &quot;Songs Without Words&quot; (1970) for Harvest Records, which was released only in Japan.

During this time, he was also playing jazz-fusion with Nucleus and recorded and toured with Mike Gibbs, featuring as lead soloist on the track &quot;Five for England&quot; on Gibbs&#x27;s &quot;Tanglewood ″63&quot; album. He played guitar on the Pete Atkin/Clive James album &quot;Driving Through Mythical America&quot;. He was a session player on Harry Nilsson&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;Nilsson Schmilsson&quot;, recorded in London. In 1970, he played on the original recording of Jesus Christ Superstar, and in 1971 he also played on &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; by Linda Hoyle and &quot;Coming from Reality&quot; by Sixto Rodriguez, who was later the subject of the 2012 documentary &quot;Searching for Sugar Man&quot;. During 1972–74, Spedding played a central role in Sharks, initially with ex-Free bassist Andy Fraser. They recorded two albums and toured with Roxy Music. After that, he toured and recorded with John Cale. He also played with Roy Harper&#x27;s occasional backing band Trigger, notably on 1975&#x27;s &quot;HQ&quot; album. In 1972–76, he played in Mike Batt&#x27;s novelty band The Wombles taking part in their UK tour in full costume wielding his trademark Gibson Flying V.

In 1975, Spedding had a Top 20 solo hit in the UK with &quot;Motor Bikin, which he promoted with popular television appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Supersonic&quot;, dressed in leather motorcycling gear, with greased hair. On his 1976 single &quot;Pogo Dancing&quot; he was backed by punk rock band The Vibrators. When further hits failed to materialise, he subsequently became better known as a session guitarist, appearing and recording with Bryan Ferry, Roxy Music, Elton John, Brian Eno, Jack Bruce, Nick Mason, Art Garfunkel, Typically Tropical, Katie Melua and Ginger Baker, amongst others. His own album &quot;Chris Spedding&quot; (1975) was produced by Mickie Most. Spedding recorded a version of the American singer-songwriter Garland Jeffreys&#x27; song, &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;, on his own &quot;Hurt&quot; album. The song has since been covered by the Circle Jerks and is featured on &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;.

Spedding was the producer of the Sex Pistols&#x27; first demos, which were recorded on 12 May 1976 at London&#x27;s Majestic Studios, where he had recorded his contributions to Eno&#x27;s album &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; and the Sharks track &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. The three tracks recorded were &quot;Problems&quot;, &quot;No Feelings&quot; and &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot;; there are persistent rumours that he played guitar and bass on their debut album, &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;, however both Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones and Spedding himself deny this entirely. The following year, Spedding featured extensively on the concept album &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot;, issued in 1978.

Spedding moved to New York City, joined the Necessaries as a guitarist and songwriter, collaborated with drummer/percussionist David Van Tieghem, and worked extensively with Robert Gordon. Before long he was back in the UK and recorded another album of his own, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Like Everybody Else&quot; (1980). The same year he appeared on Joan Armatrading&#x27;s album &quot;Me Myself I&quot;, playing lead guitar on a number of tracks, including the chart-hit title track. His live album, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was released in 1981. In 1982 he played on Nina Hagen&#x27;s recording &quot;NunSexMonkRock&quot;, and over the next few years he continued his session work on such albums as Tom Waits&#x27; &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;, while periodically releasing solo material (&quot;Mean and Moody&quot; (1985), &quot;Enemy Within&quot; (1986) and &quot;Cafe Days&quot; (1990). He worked on several solo releases by Jerry Harrison (of Talking Heads) including the critically acclaimed album Casual Gods released in 1988, spawning the No. 7 hit on US Album Rock Tracks chart: &quot;Rev It Up&quot;.

He played on the tracks &quot;Not Such A Bad Boy&quot;, &quot;So Bad&quot; and &quot;No Values&quot; on Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot; released in 1984. Spedding recalls Ringo Starr, engineer Geoff Emerick and producer George Martin working on the same sessions as well as McCartney and his wife, Linda. In the same year he played on Roger Daltrey&#x27;s solo album &quot;Parting Should Be Painless&quot;. Spedding was producer of the first two albums by the Canadian rockabilly band, The Razorbacks, entitled &quot;Go to Town&quot; (1988) and &quot;Live a Little&quot; (1989). In 1995, he played on Willy DeVille&#x27;s &quot;Big Easy Fantasy&quot;, and later that year, on his album &quot;Loup Garou&quot;.
Accepting an invitation, Spedding toured with a reformed Roxy Music in 2001. By now in his late fifties, Spedding&#x27;s own blues rock offerings &quot;One Step Ahead of the Blues&quot; (2002) and &quot;Click Clack&quot; (2005) were released, followed by &quot;It&#x27;s Now Or Never&quot; in 2007. He was one of only two musicians from the 1976 album &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot; to return for Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Black Smoke Band&#x27;s 2006–2012 tour of Europe. He then featured on the 2012 album &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds – The New Generation&quot;, touring with the show in 2012 and 2014.

On 31 October 2011 the 11 track CD &quot;King Mob&quot; album was released featuring Spedding on guitar, Glen Matlock on bass, Martin Chambers on drums, Sixteen on guitar and fronted by Stephen W. Parsons, aka Snips a former member of Sharks. Although both the album and live shows received positive reviews, King Mob announced that they were disbanding in September 2012.

In June 2014 Spedding appeared as a special guest playing guitar with Bryan Ferry at the 2014 Glastonbury Festival. In 2017 and 2019 he toured the US with Ferry.

<text>Christopher J. Chambers (born August 12, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for 10 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Wisconsin Badgers. He was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft, and also played for the San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs.

After his playing career, Chambers served in 2021 as the first-ever University of Fort Lauderdale head football coach.

==Early life==
Chambers attended Bedford High School in Bedford, Ohio. While there, he was a three-sport letterman in football, basketball and track. In football, he won All-America accolades and was a two-time all-state selection. In basketball, he was a third-team all-state performer as a senior. He was a high school teammate of wide receiver Lee Evans, who also played for the Wisconsin Badgers.

In track, he won the state championship in the 400-meter dash as a senior with a time of 47.1 seconds. He also ran the 200-meter dash in 21.4 seconds.

==College career==
Following high school, Chambers was a four-year letterman at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Chambers played in 43 games during his career, starting the final 33. He was also a backup guard on the Badgers basketball team during his freshman year in 1997–98.

Chambers topped the football team in receiving his sophomore season when he totaled 28 catches for 563 yards and seven touchdowns, including an 80-yard grab against Michigan. He missed two games as a junior with a broken finger, but still led the team in receiving with 41 catches for 578 yards and four scores, and was an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection. Despite playing in only nine games as a senior because of a stress fracture in his right foot, Chambers put together the most productive season of his career with 52 receptions for 813 yards and five touchdowns. He was a second-team All-Big Ten Conference selection. He had the best game of his career when he hauled in 11 passes for 191 yards against Iowa. That game came one week after he had 11 receptions for 173 yards and a touchdown against Purdue.

He finished his collegiate career with 127 receptions for 2,004 yards and 16 touchdowns. He also rushed for 17 yards on two carries, returned one kickoff for 15 yards and fielded five punts for two yards. He currently ranks fourth on the school&#x27;s all-time list for receptions and yardage, and fifth in receiving touchdowns. He was part of Badger teams that won the Rose Bowl following the 1998 and 1999 seasons.

==Professional career==
===Miami Dolphins===

====2001====

Chambers was drafted by the Miami Dolphins 52nd overall in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft. Chambers turned in one of the most productive seasons of any rookie wide receiver in club history. He started seven of the 16 games in which he played, and finished with 48 receptions for 883 yards and seven touchdowns. His yardage and touchdown totals both led the team, as did his 18.4-yards per reception average. His reception figure ranked third on the team behind those of fellow receivers Oronde Gadsden and James McKnight. Chambers finished the year ranked 18th in the AFC in receiving yards, while his average per catch was first among the top 20 receivers in both the AFC and NFC. Chambers topped the 100-yard receiving mark three times. He also returned 36 kickoffs for a 22.5-yard average with a long of 47. Chambers missed the team&#x27;s first-round playoff game on January 13, 2002, against the Baltimore Ravens due to a sprained ankle suffered the last week of the regular season.

====2002====
In 2002, Chambers started all 15 games in which he played. He missed the team&#x27;s October 20 contest against the Buffalo Bills while recovering from a concussion suffered on a hit by then-Denver Broncos safety Kenoy Kennedy. Chambers led team with 52 receptions for 734 yards and also scored three touchdowns. He totaled 78 rushing yards on six carries, including a long run of 45 yards. He had seven catches of 25 yards or longer (second-most on the team), trailing only James McKnight (9). Chambers led the team in receptions five times and in receiving yards on five occasions as well. His rushing total on the year was the fourth-highest single-season total by a Dolphins wide receiver at the time, and it was the highest figure since Nat Moore had 89 yards in 1977.

====2003====
Chambers started all 16 games in 2003, becoming the first Dolphins wide receiver to do so since Oronde Gadsden in 2000. He finished the season with 64 catches for 963 yards and 11 touchdowns, leading the team in all three categories. His reception total tied for 14th in the AFC, while his yardage figure ranked seventh. He tied for fifth in the conference in overall touchdowns and was first in the AFC and third in the NFL in receiving scores. Chambers accounted for the most catches by a Dolphin since 1999 when Tony Martin had 67 receptions. Chambers&#x27; yardage total was the most by a Dolphin since Martin had 1,037 yards in 1999, and his 11 touchdowns were the most since Mark Clayton hauled in 12 receiving scores in 1991. Of Chambers&#x27; 64 receptions, eight went for 25 yards or longer, topping the team. Over the course of the season, he led the team in receptions nine times and in receiving yards on nine occasions. His average per reception of 15.0 tied for the ninth-highest figure among the top 50 receiving yardage leaders in the AFC. He also rushed for 30 yards on four attempts on the year.

====2004====
Chambers started 15 games in 2004, missing only an October 3 contest against the New York Jets with a knee injury. He led Miami in both receiving yards and touchdowns with 898 yards and seven scores. His 69 receptions were second on the team only to tight end Randy McMichael&#x27;s 73. It marked the fourth straight year in which Chambers led the team in receiving yardage, which made him just the third Dolphin ever to achieve this feat, joining Paul Warfield (1970–1973) and Nat Moore (1974–1977). Chambers had six receptions of 25 yards or longer – the most on the team. He also rushed for 76 yards on nine attempts during the course of the season, including a season-long 24-yard run against the Arizona Cardinals on November 7. He led team in receptions seven times and in receiving yards on five occasions during the course of the season. His reception total was 15th in the AFC while his yardage figure ranked 18th. Chambers accounted for four 100-yard receiving games on the year, tied for the sixth-highest single-season figure in club history and the most by a Dolphin since Tony Martin had five in 1999.

====2005====
In 2005, Chambers started all 16 games in which he played. He led Miami with 82 receptions for 1,118 yards and 11 touchdowns – figures which earned him his first Pro Bowl selection. His reception total tied for sixth in the AFC and 13th in the NFL, while his yardage figure was third in the conference and 12th in the league. His eleven touchdown catches tied for the second-highest figure in the conference and third in the NFL, trailing only Indianapolis&#x27; Marvin Harrison (12) and Carolina&#x27;s Steve Smith (12). Chambers set career highs for both receptions and receiving yards, while his touchdown total equaled his career best from 2003. Over the final six games of the season, he recorded 43 catches for 620 yards and six touchdowns. With 82 catches on the year, Chambers became the first wide receiver to increase his receiving totals in each of his first five NFL seasons since Muhsin Muhammad did it from 1996 to 2000 with the Carolina Panthers. In addition, Chambers became just the second Dolphins wide receiver to do it, joining O.J. McDuffie (1993–1997). He became the first Dolphin to record 1,000 or more receiving yards since Tony Martin had 1,037 receiving yards in 1999. Overall, it marked the 14th time a Dolphin had a 1,000 receiving yard season, and he is the sixth different Dolphin player to reach that plateau, joining Mark Clayton (five times), Mark Duper (four), Irving Fryar (two), O.J. McDuffie (one) and Tony Martin (one). Chambers also rushed for 92 yards on 12 attempts during the course of the season, good for third on the team in rushing.

Chambers&#x27; best game of the season (and his career) came on December 4 against the Buffalo Bills. In the game, which the Dolphins trailed by 20 points entering the fourth quarter, Chambers caught 15 passes for 238 yards and a touchdown. Key receptions included a 57-yard grab on the final drive with under two minutes left, as well as the game-winning touchdown on a pass from Sage Rosenfels with only six seconds remaining. His impressive performance earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. His yardage total was the highest for any player in the NFL in 2005, and the most by any player since Plaxico Burress had 253 yards for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2002.

A high school and college teammate, Bills wide receiver Lee Evans, also had a career day during the game with 117 receiving yards and three touchdowns—both personal bests.

====2006====
Chambers suffered a down season in 2006 after a Pro Bowl performance the year before. The Dolphins&#x27; offense struggled as a whole, and he never seemed to be a favorite target for quarterback Joey Harrington, and finished third on the team in both receptions and receiving yards. He also ranked third on the team in rushing with eight rushes for 95 yards. Chambers led the team in receptions four times and in reception yardage four times during a season in which he started all 16 games. He was held without a catch on December 17 at the Buffalo Bills, breaking his streak of making at least one reception in 60 consecutive games.

===San Diego Chargers===
====2007====
Just before the October 16, 2007 NFL trade deadline, the San Diego Chargers acquired wide receiver Chris Chambers from the Miami Dolphins for a 2nd round pick in the upcoming 2008 NFL draft. Signed through 2009, Chambers was reunited with Chargers coach Norv Turner, who was Miami&#x27;s offensive coordinator in 2002–03. The Chargers hoped that Chambers&#x27; experience this season with Dolphins head coach Cam Cameron, whose offense is a derivative of the Norv Turner offense, would help make the transition to the Chargers smoother. The decision to go after Chambers was made after the team realized that receiver Eric Parker&#x27;s toe injury was not healing fast enough for him to have an impact in 2007 and he was subsequently placed on injured reserve to make room on the roster for Chambers.

The Chargers are responsible for $3.5M of Chambers&#x27; $5.4M 2007 salary. Chambers was scheduled to earn $5.1M and $4.55M in 2008 and 2009 respectively.

In Chambers&#x27; first games with the Chargers, he caught two passes for 35 yards and a touchdown. On the season, Chambers had 66 receptions for 970 yards and 4 touchdowns. While with the Chargers, Chambers produced 35 receptions, 555 yards, and 4 touchdowns, in addition another 16 catches for 268 yards, and one more score in their three playoff games that year.

====2008====
As of Week 15 in the 2008 season with the San Diego Chargers, Chambers had 26 receptions for 357 yards with 5 touchdowns, and 1 rushing yard on 1 rushing attempt. Chambers&#x27; was inactive in weeks 6 and 7 due to an ankle injury sustained during a game against the Miami Dolphins. Chambers finished the 2008 season with 33 receptions for 462 yards and 5 touchdowns.

====2009====
Chambers was released by the Chargers on November 2 At the time of his release, Chambers had only 9 receptions for 122 yards with 1 touchdown.

===Kansas City Chiefs===

Chambers was claimed off waivers by the Kansas City Chiefs on November 3. He made his Chiefs debut in week 9, catching 3 passes for 70 yards and 2 touchdowns. On November 22, Chambers helped the Chiefs upset the defending Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers with 119 receiving yards, including a 61-yard catch and run in overtime that set up the Chiefs&#x27; game-winning field goal.

On March 8, 2010, Chambers re-signed a 3-year, $15 million contract with the Kansas City Chiefs. He was released on July 28, 2011.

On April 19, 2018, Chambers signed a one-day contract to retire as a member of the Dolphins.

<text>The West Midlands is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of International Territorial Level for statistical purposes. It covers the western half of the area known traditionally as the Midlands. The region consists of the counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Midlands and Worcestershire. The region has seven cities: Birmingham, Coventry, Hereford, Lichfield, Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton and Worcester.

The West Midlands region is geographically diverse, from the urban central areas of the West Midlands conurbation to the rural counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire which border Wales, and Worcestershire. The region is landlocked; however, the longest river in the UK, the River Severn, traverses the region south-eastwards, flowing through the county towns of Shrewsbury and Worcester, and the Ironbridge Gorge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Staffordshire is home to the industrialised Potteries conurbation, including the city of Stoke-on-Trent and the Staffordshire Moorlands area, which borders the south-eastern Peak District National Park near Leek. The region also encompasses five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: the Wye Valley, Shropshire Hills, Cannock Chase, Malvern Hills and parts of the Cotswolds. Warwickshire is home to the towns of Stratford upon Avon, birthplace of writer William Shakespeare; Rugby, the birthplace of Rugby football; and Nuneaton, birthplace to author George Eliot.

==Geography==

The official region contains the ceremonial counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Midlands and Worcestershire.

There is some confusion in the use of the term &quot;West Midlands&quot;, as the name is also used for the much smaller West Midlands county and conurbation which is in the central belt of the Midlands and on the eastern side of the West Midlands Region. It is also still used by various organisations within that area, such as West Midlands Police and West Midlands Fire Service.

The highest point in the region is Black Mountain, at 703 metres (2,307 ft) in west Herefordshire on the border with Powys, Wales.

The region contains five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), including the Shropshire Hills, Malvern Hills and Cannock Chase, and parts of the Wye Valley and Cotswolds. The Peak District national park also stretches into the northern corner of Staffordshire.

==Modern history==

===Second World War===
The RAF Fauld explosion on 27 November 1944 in east Staffordshire produced a 100-foot deep crater, and is the UK&#x27;s largest explosion, being caused by around 4,000 tonnes of high explosive, and may be the world&#x27;s largest non-nuclear explosion.

Birmingham was the third most bombed city in the UK after London and Liverpool; Spitfires were built in Castle Bromwich, Lancasters at Austin&#x27;s works in Longbridge at Cofton Hackett, and the Birmingham Small Arms Company at Small Heath produced the M1919 Browning machine gun. Boulton Paul Aircraft had their main aircraft factory in the north of Wolverhampton. RAF Defford, in the south of Worcestershire between Pershore and Croome Park, was where many important airborne radars were developed, such as H2S (radar) and anti-submarine radars.

===Scientific heritage===
Thomas Wedgwood, son of Josiah Wedgwood, discovered the first photo-sensitive (light-sensitive) chemicals – silver nitrate and silver chloride in the 1790s.

Sir Norman Lockyer of Rugby discovered helium in 1868, for which he used electromagnetic spectroscopy.

Edward Weston of Oswestry, who emigrated to the US, built the first accurate voltmeter in the late 1880s, and the Weston cell in 1893.

Francis W. Aston of Harborne, educated at the University of Birmingham, developed mass spectrometry in 1919, which helped him to identify the first isotopes, receiving the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1922.

Dennis Gabor invented holography at British Thomson-Houston in Rugby in 1947, receiving the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1971.

James Glaisher in 1862 took a record balloon flight with Henry Tracey Coxwell for the BAAS near Wolverhampton. They reached the composition of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere until then was not understood; the altitude records for the UK have not been exceeded since; Project Excelsior in the US in 1960 would later reach .

Philip Lawley of Burton upon Trent was first person to realise that chemical damage to DNA caused cancer (at the Chester Beatty Research Institute in London) in the early 1960s.

Francis Galton (d. 1911) of the Darwin–Wedgwood family&#x27;s Birmingham branch was an early eugenicist rooted in improving animal breeding stock and examining heredity. He invented terms eugenics and &quot;nature versus nurture&quot;. His limited calls for human eugenics were widened by the German Society for Racial Hygiene in 1905 founded by Alfred Ploetz, which coupled with the racial superiority fallacies of Aryanism reached its nadir in genocidal antisemitism. Moral teachings and inherent repulsions towards human eugenics were overcome by a minority of those in power espousing racial equality; European media and leaders lamented loss of Empire, advocated ultranationalism and prized military physical advantage; Galton saw human eugenics as part of all means to &quot;do better&quot;.

===Industrial heritage===
Much of the Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom began in Birmingham and the Black Country area of West Midlands. The Industrial Revolution is thought to have begun when Abraham Darby substituted coke in the place of charcoal to smelt iron, at his Old Furnace. The Black Country may be regarded as the world&#x27;s first industrial landscape, while nearby Ironbridge Gorge claims to be the Birthplace of Industry. The world&#x27;s first cast iron bridge in 1779 spans the Gorge. The first self-propelled locomotive to run on rails in 1803 at Coalbrookdale, was built by Richard Trevithick. The first iron rails for horse-drawn transport, were made at Coalbrookdale in 1768 by Richard Reynolds at Ketley Ironworks. Iron rails only became widely successful in 1820 when made out of wrought iron at Bedlington Ironworks in north-east England.
Birmingham&#x27;s industrial development was triggered by discussions at the Lunar Society of Birmingham at Soho House, Boulton&#x27;s house, and products were carried along the BCN Main Line canal. Soho Manufactory was the first man-made-powered factory in world. Chance Brothers of Smethwick built the glass for The Crystal Palace in 1851. Smethwick Engine, now at Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, is the oldest working steam engine, made in 1779, and is the oldest working engine in the world. Smethwick was a main centre for making lighthouse lanterns.

Valor Fires in Erdington developed the first radiant gas fire in 1967, a balanced flue fire in 1973, and a natural flame gas fire in 1978. The Erdington site, owned by Iceland&#x27;s BDR Thermea, closed in May 2012. The company also built gas cookers; since 2011 the company has been part of Glen Dimplex, who have a site at Cooper&#x27;s Bank, south of Gornalwood.
Ditherington Flax Mill in Shrewsbury was the first iron-framed building in the world in 1797. Thomas Bolton &amp; Sons of Froghall, Staffordshire, made the world&#x27;s first transatlantic telegraph cable in 1857, having supplied a submarine cable across the English Channel in 1850. On 10 July 1890, a trunk circuit telephone line was opened between London and Birmingham by the National Telephone Company; for the first time this allowed phone calls between the London and the north. The world&#x27;s first coaxial cable was laid between London and Birmingham in 1936 to give 40 channels for telephone traffic. and brought into use in 1938, later extended to Manchester in 1940.

Alexander Parkes invented the first man-made plastic (thermoplastic) in Birmingham in 1856. Princess Square, Wolverhampton, was the site of Britain&#x27;s first traffic lights in 1927. Infrared cameras were developed at the Royal Radar Establishment in Malvern (with EMI Electronics) in 1967. The world&#x27;s first Maglev train operated at Birmingham Airport in 1983. The tallest freestanding structure in the region was the chimney of Ironbridge power station at 673 ft. John Baskerville of Birmingham, a former stone carver, largely invented fonts, or typefaces, for printing.

Much of the UK&#x27;s car industry would be centred in Coventry and Birmingham; most of this has now gone. Midland Motor Cylinder (part of Birmid Industries) of Smethwick was the largest producer of automobile cylinder blocks in Europe. Fort Dunlop was Europe&#x27;s largest tyre plant. Metro-Cammell in Birmingham made most of the 1970s and 1980s London Underground trains. MG Rover (a company of Rover) closed in 2005 (from 1885), The Ryton plant, which made the Peugeot 206, closed at the end of 2006, with production moving to Trnava in Slovakia, and some to a plant at Kolín in the Czech Republic. Alfred Herbert of Coventry was the largest machine-tool manufacturer in the UK for many decades; it was brought down in the 1970s by advancing technology overseas, and complacent strategic decisions of the management, finally closing in 1982; many Midlands manufacturing companies followed similar fates in the 1970s and 1980s.
Henry Wiggin &amp; Co of Hereford developed the metal alloys necessary for other Midlands&#x27; (and beyond) automotive and aerospace companies – Inconel, Incoloy and Nimonic. It was the lack of vanadium for high-melting point alloys, caused by Royal Navy action, that prevented German Me 262 engines being serviceable; had German Second World War engineers had a greater supply of vanadium and molybdenum, the engine life (around 12 hours maximum, from entering service in April 1944 to the end of the war) of their jet engine would have increased much more, which would have been significant to the war&#x27;s outcome. Bristol Siddeley developed the rocket engines for Black Arrow at Ansty; in fact all of R-R&#x27;s rocket engines were developed and built there at R-R&#x27;s Industrial and Marine Gas Turbine Division; Britain&#x27;s smaller rocket engines for missiles were built by Bristol Aerojet in what is now North Somerset. High Duty Alloys at Redditch constructed (forged) the compressor and turbine blades for Whittle&#x27;s first engines, and many of the early jet engines; it made Concorde&#x27;s airframe from the Hiduminium R.R.58 aluminium alloy.

Maxaret, the world&#x27;s first ABS braking system, was invented in Coventry by Dunlop in the early 1950s for aircraft; John Boyd Dunlop was a Scottish vet who had first produced the first pneumatic tyres in 1889. Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, grandson of Matthew Boulton, and born in the area, invented the aileron, an important flight control surface in 1868, decades before the first actual flight. Triumph Engineering was a famous motorbike firm in Meriden. About a quarter of all British WWI planes were built in Coventry. The Jensen Interceptor FF was the first production four-wheel-drive car in the world, designed by Major Tony Rolt, and built at their factory in West Bromwich.

Cadbury launched &quot;Dairy Milk&quot; in 1905, &quot;Bournville&quot; in 1906, &quot;Fruit &amp; Nut&quot; in 1928, &quot;Whole Nut&quot; in 1930, &quot;Cadbury Roses&quot; in 1938, and the &quot;Cadbury Creme Egg&quot; in 1971. George and Richard Cadbury built their factory in 1879 and Bournville in 1893, named after the Bourn brook. Iceland (supermarket) opened its first store in Oswestry in 1970 – heralding the onset of frozen food in the UK. Alfred Bird invented egg-free custard in 1837 in Birmingham – accidentally given to guests at his home, being created as his wife had an allergy to eggs; he then invented baking powder in 1843 as his wife also had an allergy to yeast.

===Culture===
J. R. R. Tolkien grew up in Birmingham, Kings Heath, then part of Worcestershire, and was inspired by Moseley Bog and Sarehole, and perhaps by the Perrott&#x27;s Folly. Philip Larkin came from Coventry. Rowland Hill (stamps) was from Kidderminster. The writer George Eliot came from Nuneaton. Anthony E. Pratt from Birmingham invented Cluedo.

Frederick Gibberd of Coventry designed Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. Edward Cave from Rugby made Britain&#x27;s first magazine in 1731 – The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine. Philip Astley from Newcastle-under-Lyme invented the modern day circus in 1768 – Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre.

The Castlemorton Common Festival in May 1992 near Malvern, led to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

The Nowka Bais is a Bengali boat racing festival which takes place annually in Birmingham. It is a cultural event in the West Midlands, United Kingdom attracting not only the Bangladeshi diaspora but a variety of cultures. It is also the largest kind of boat race in the United Kingdom.

==Regional assembly==

The official representative body of the region is the West Midlands Leaders Board which has limited administrative functions such as regional planning and economic development. The board is not an elected body, but is made up of members appointed from local councils across the region and is known as a quango. It is based on &quot;Edward Street&quot; in Birmingham, near the National Indoor Arena. From March 2010, the funding decisions at regional level were taken over by Advantage West Midlands, the Regional Development Agency.

==Demographics==

===Religion===
===Ethnicity===
The West Midlands is the second most ethnically diverse region of the UK (London being the most diverse). This is in large part due to the West Midlands conurbation, which is highly diverse. The ethnic makeup of the West Midlands as a whole as measured by the 2011 census was as follows:

===Teenage pregnancy===
For top-tier authorities in the West Midlands, Stoke-on-Trent has the highest teenage pregnancy rate. For council districts, Nuneaton and Bedworth in Warwickshire has the highest rate closely followed by Tamworth. For top-tier authorities, Shropshire has the lowest rate, and for council districts Malvern Hills has the lowest rate.

===Social deprivation===
The region, from studies of multiple deprivation, shows similarities with Yorkshire and the Humber, and is more deprived than the neighbouring East Midlands. From the Indices of deprivation 2007, it can be seen that, in common with Northern England, the region has more Lower Area Super Output Areas in the 20% most deprived districts than in the 20% least deprived districts. The region&#x27;s most deprived council districts, in descending order, are Birmingham (10th highest in England), Sandwell (14th), Stoke-on-Trent (16th), Wolverhampton (28th), Walsall (45th), Coventry (61st), and Dudley (100th).

The least deprived districts in 2007 (before Shropshire became a unitary authority in 2009) were Bromsgrove, South Staffordshire, Warwick, Wychavon, and Lichfield. At county level, the least deprived areas, in descending order, were Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Solihull, Staffordshire, and Shropshire.

In March 2011 the region had the second highest overall unemployment claimant count in England at 4.7%, second to North East England. The highest in the region was Wolverhampton at 7.7%, the joint second highest (with Manchester) unemployment rate in England. Next is Sandwell with 7.1%, Birmingham with 7.0%, and Walsall with 6.4%. The lowest rate in the region is the district of Stratford-on-Avon, with 1.6% – one of the lowest unemployment rates in England.

==Politics==
===Elections===
In the 2015 general election, the Conservatives gained the largest share of the region by popular vote and took control of the number of seats, with 42% of the region&#x27;s electorate voting Conservative, 33% Labour, 16% UKIP, 6% Liberal Democrat and 3% Green. The Conservatives gained 2 seats with virtually no swing from Labour to Conservative.

In the 2017 general election, South Staffordshire (Gavin Williamson) had the second-highest Conservative vote proportion in the UK – 69.8%. David Firth, at the University of Warwick, invented the BBC election exit poll. 6 ft 9 Daniel Kawczynski, a Shropshire MP, is the tallest MP ever.

Although having a slightly smaller percentage of the vote than the neighbouring East Midlands, the geographic area of the West Midlands is more Conservative, due to Labour&#x27;s vote now consigned to the urban areas of Birmingham, Coventry and Stoke-on-Trent. The number of seats is more favoured towards Labour than the geographic spread, with 35 Conservative seats and 24 Labour. All of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire is now Conservative.

===Political parties===
The Green Party of England and Wales was formed at the Bridge Inn in Napton-on-the-Hill, Warwickshire, in February 1973, originating from an article by Paul R. Ehrlich about population growth in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. In 1975, it became the Ecology Party and then the Green Party in 1985.

===ITL===
In the ONS International Territorial Levels (ITL), the West Midlands form a level-1 ITL region, coded &quot;UKG&quot;, which is subdivided as follows:

==Local government==
The region consists of the following administrative subdivisions:

Key: †two-tier non-metropolitan county | *metropolitan county including the West Midlands Combined Authority and mayor

===Demography===

The West Midlands&#x27; population accounts for almost 11% of England&#x27;s overall population. 49.36% of the region&#x27;s population resides in the West Midlands county, 20.17% in Staffordshire, 10.49% in Worcestershire, 9.91% in Warwickshire, 8.56% in Shropshire, and 3.37% in Herefordshire.

==Economy==
Business Link West Midlands was based on the Quinton Business Park in Quinton, next to Highways England. NHS West Midlands, the strategic health authority was in Edgbaston. The West Midlands Ambulance Service is in Brierley Hill, near the headquarters of West Midlands Police, where the Child Support Agency (CSA) was headquartered. The region&#x27;s Manufacturing Advisory Service was on Wolverhampton Science Park, north of the city centre; this function is now represented by Made in the Midlands, north of Wolverhampton.

The DIT West Midlands for the region is based at the West Midlands Chambers of Commerce on &quot;Harborne Road&quot;, south of NHS West Midlands west of Five Ways. Most of the region is covered by the Midlands Air Ambulance, except Warwickshire is covered by the Warwickshire &amp; Northamptonshire Air Ambulance, based at Coventry Airport; both are charity-funded. Sir Anthony Bamford of Staffordshire is the richest British industrialist, at around £3.15bn in 2014; Sir James Dyson is second (£3bn).

==Education==

===Secondary education===
Selective schools are in low numbers as follows: Birmingham (8), Walsall (2), Wolverhampton (1), Warwickshire (6), Stoke-on-Trent (1), and Telford and Wrekin (2). The highest proportion per head therefore is Warwickshire (its population is between 550,000 and 600,000 people). The other counties and metropolitan boroughs have none, their public education systems are comprehensive in intake. The grammar and independent schools tend to produce pass-rate examination results among the top twenty ranked regionally. Many pupils compete for entrance examinations to attend such long-established Grammar Schools and most have significant parent sponsorship. In 2016 two of the top ten such schools nationally were in Warwickshire, where in the CV37 postal district prices were 34% higher than the county as a whole.

Around 275,000 secondary schools are in the region, the greatest number after the South East, Greater London and North West.

At GCSE based on % of entrants&#x27; pass rates, the best performing local government area in 2010 was Solihull, closely followed by Warwickshire and Shropshire. Dudley, Herefordshire, Telford and Wrekin, Birmingham and Staffordshire (in descending order) are above the English average, at which rate, is approximately Worcestershire. The area consistently having fewest passes is Sandwell, followed by Stoke-on-Trent. Struggling pupils in Wolverhampton and Walsall also attain fewer passes than the English average in most GCSE years, sometimes by a very narrow margin. For metropolitan boroughs, Solihull then Dudley perform best. Dudley is the best metropolitan borough at A-level passes and has a consistent post-2000 history of being better than Solihull.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, schools have been off-rolling pupils. Pupils likely to perform poorly in examinations are expelled before the examinations to improve the school performance in league tables. Expelled pupils then disproportionately get involved in gangs and in crime. Knife crime in the West Midlands is the highest outside London.

In 2010, regionally in persistent truancy at secondary school, Sandwell had the highest rate at 6.9%; Bromsgrove had the lowest at 2.3%.

===Tertiary education===
There are thirty-seven FE colleges (FECs). There are six LSCs for the area (which fund FECs), and the Learning and Skills Council head office is based in Coventry. The five largest FE colleges in the region – Bournville College, North Warwickshire and Hinckley College, Solihull College, South &amp; City College Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent College – each have more than 25,000 students.

School children in Shropshire and Solihull are most likely to attend university, followed by Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire.

===School league tables===
Below is a list of the top twenty state schools in the West Midlands by 2010 A level results:
* 1. King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Girls, Kings Heath (1212)
* 2. Sutton Coldfield Grammar School for Girls
* 3. King Edward VI Five Ways, Bartley Green
* 4. King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys, Kings Heath
* 5. Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School for Girls
* 6. Queen Mary&#x27;s Grammar School, Walsall
* 7. King Edward VI College, Stourbridge
* 8. Newport Girls High School
* 9. King Edward VI Handsworth
* 10. King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon
* 11. King Edward VI Aston
* 12. Bishop Vesey&#x27;s Grammar School, Sutton Coldfield
* 13. Wolverhampton Girls&#x27; High School
* 14. Thomas Telford School, Telford
* 15. St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Stoke-on-Trent
* 16. Queen Mary&#x27;s High School, Walsall
* 17. Rugby High School for Girls
* 18. St Augustine&#x27;s High School, Redditch
* 19. Hereford Sixth Form College
* 20. Moorlands Sixth Form College, Cheadle, Staffordshire

===Universities===


The University of Birmingham is the main university in the region and has the most funding. It has a large research grant, as does the University of Warwick, which is the next largest in terms of funding. Birmingham and Warwick are members of the Russell Group of public research universities. Keele and Aston have a moderate research grant, but none of the other universities do. Keele, although having the largest campus in the UK (by area), is one of the smallest universities in the region. There are medical schools at Warwick, Keele and Birmingham. Birmingham and Warwick receive more than twice as much total income than any other university in the region – around £400 million each.

Around 45% of students are from the region, and 35% from other parts of the UK, while 20% are from overseas. The region attracts students from South East England owing to good access via the M40 and the West Coast Main Line, but there is a good mix from other regions too, except the North East (especially) and Yorkshire. Students native to the West Midlands are most likely to study in the region (40%), then the East Midlands (12%), the North West (11%), and then Yorkshire (9%). Very few go to the East of England or the North East. The region has a net export of university students to other regions.

At time of graduation in 2010 almost 60% of graduates remained in the West Midlands, with 10% going to London, 7% to the South-East, and around 5% to the East Midlands. Very few go to Yorkshire, the North-East, or even (neighbouring) Wales.

==Transport==

===Railways===

Served by many lines in the urban areas such as the West Coast Main Line and branches. The Welsh Marches Line and the Cotswold Line transect the region as well as the Cross Country Route and Chiltern Line. There are plans to reopen the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway. The HS2 (High Speed Two) project is planned to connect London to Birmingham by 2026.

===Road===
Several notable roads pass through the region, with most converging around the central conurbation. The M5, which connects South West England to the region, passes through Worcestershire, near to Worcester, and through the West Midlands county, past West Bromwich, with its northern terminus at its junction with the M6 just south of Walsall. The M6, which has its southern terminus just outside the southeast of the region at its junction with the M1, and which connects the region to North West England, passes Rugby and Nuneaton in Warwickshire, Coventry and Birmingham, and Stafford and Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire. The M6 toll provides an alternative route to the M6 between Coleshill and Cannock, passing north of Sutton Coldfield and just south of Lichfield.

The M40 connects the region through South East England to London, with its northern terminus at its junction with the M42; it passes close to Warwick and Banbury. The M42 connects the M5 at Bromsgrove, passing around the south and east of Birmingham, joining the M40 and M6, passing Solihull and Castle Bromwich, to Tamworth, northeast of Birmingham. The M50 connects the M5 from near Tewkesbury to Ross-on-Wye in the southwest. The M54 connects Wellington in the west, passing Telford, to the M6 near Cannock. The A5 road traverses the region northwest–southeast, passing through Shrewsbury, Telford, Cannock, Tamworth and Nuneaton.

The longest elevated road viaduct in the UK is the section from Gravelly Hill to Castle Bromwich on the M6, opened on 24 May 1972; the Bromford Viaduct is the longest viaduct in the UK. The section of the A45 in Coventry from Willenhall to Allesley in 1939 was one of the UK&#x27;s first ever large planned road schemes; road schemes on that scale had not been previously built, with few large road schemes outside of London, or were piecemeal.

Princes Square in Wolverhampton had Britain&#x27;s first automatic traffic lights on 5 November 1927. On 13 January 2012, 34-year-old Ben Westwood of Wednesfield, was caught by the police, when speeding at 180 mph, in an Audi RS5 with a Lamborghini engine, from Wolverhampton up to Stafford on the M6, and back again. He was travelling so fast that he was outpacing the Central Counties Air Operations Unit Eurocopter helicopter. He and the vehicle had been in fifteen smash and grab raids and he was jailed for nine years at Wolverhampton Crown Court in August 2012.

===Transport policy===
As part of the transport planning system, the Regional Assembly is under statutory requirement to produce a regional transport strategy (RTS) to provide long term planning for transport in the region. This involves region-wide transport schemes such as those carried out by Highways England and Network Rail.

Within the region, the local transport authorities carry out transport planning through the use of a local transport plan (LTP) which outlines their strategies, policies and implementation programme. The most recent LTP is that for the period 2006–11. In the West Midlands region, the following transport authorities have published their LTP online: Herefordshire, Shropshire U.A., Staffordshire, Telford and Wrekin U.A., Warwickshire, West Midlands and Worcestershire. The transport authority of Stoke-on-Trent U.A. publishes a joint local transport plan in partnership with Staffordshire County Council to cover the North Staffordshire Major Urban Area, which includes Stoke-on-Trent and the more urban parts of Newcastle-under-Lyme and Staffordshire Moorlands.

==Media==
=== Television ===

The West Midlands region of the BBC is based at the Mailbox in Birmingham. From there, the regional programme Midlands Today is produced, as well as the BBC&#x27;S flagship daytime series &quot;Doctors&quot;. ITV Central broadcasts from Birmingham, off Broad Street on Gas Street next to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, with its ITV News Central regional programme.

Some northern parts of the region, including Biddulph, receive BBC North West Tonight and Granada Reports both of which are based at MediaCityUK in Salford and are broadcast from the Winter Hill transmitter.

The BBC has its engineering training centre at Wood Norton, Worcestershire, off the A44 north of Evesham in Norton and Lenchwick. BBC English Regions is based at Birmingham.

==Sport==
The National Sports Centre at Lilleshall Hall is in Sheriffhales, Shropshire, north-east of Telford; it was largely established by the Central Council of Physical Recreation in 1949 as a National Recreation Centre; the south of England had theirs at Bisham Abbey on the Thames. St George&#x27;s Park National Football Centre is at Tatenhill near Byrkley Park in Needwood Forest, near former the RAF Tatenhill off the A515, four miles west of Burton upon Trent.

The Tough Guy Competition, now a widespread sport competition in the US, began in 1987 on a farm at Perton in Staffordshire. The main British athletics championships are held in Birmingham in late June. The Olympic Movement started at Much Wenlock, and also to the east of region, where Baron de Coubertin formulated his ideas for sport and the Olympics at Rugby School in 1883, with the headmaster Thomas Arnold, whose son would be the famous poet Matthew Arnold and whose great-grandson would be Aldous Huxley.

<text>In the field of optics, transparency (also called pellucidity or diaphaneity) is the physical property of allowing light to pass through the material without appreciable scattering of light. On a macroscopic scale (one in which the dimensions are much larger than the wavelengths of the photons in question), the photons can be said to follow Snell&#x27;s law. Translucency (also called translucence or translucidity) allows light to pass through but does not necessarily (again, on the macroscopic scale) follow Snell&#x27;s law; the photons can be scattered at either of the two interfaces, or internally, where there is a change in the index of refraction. In other words, a translucent material is made up of components with different indices of refraction. A transparent material is made up of components with a uniform index of refraction. Transparent materials appear clear, with the overall appearance of one color, or any combination leading up to a brilliant spectrum of every color. The opposite property of translucency is opacity. Other categories of visual appearance, related to the perception of regular or diffuse reflection and transmission of light, have been organized under the concept of cesia in an order system with three variables, including transparency, translucency and opacity among the involved aspects.

When light encounters a material, it can interact with it in several different ways. These interactions depend on the wavelength of the light and the nature of the material. Photons interact with an object by some combination of reflection, absorption and transmission.
Some materials, such as plate glass and clean water, transmit much of the light that falls on them and reflect little of it; such materials are called optically transparent. Many liquids and aqueous solutions are highly transparent. Absence of structural defects (voids, cracks, etc.) and molecular structure of most liquids are mostly responsible for excellent optical transmission.

Materials that do not transmit light are called opaque. Many such substances have a chemical composition which includes what are referred to as absorption centers. Many substances are selective in their absorption of white light frequencies. They absorb certain portions of the visible spectrum while reflecting others. The frequencies of the spectrum which are not absorbed are either reflected or transmitted for our physical observation. This is what gives rise to color. The attenuation of light of all frequencies and wavelengths is due to the combined mechanisms of absorption and scattering.

Transparency can provide almost perfect camouflage for animals able to achieve it. This is easier in dimly-lit or turbid seawater than in good illumination. Many marine animals such as jellyfish are highly transparent.

== Etymology ==
* late Middle English: from Old French, from medieval Latin - &#x27;visible through&#x27;, from Latin , from - &#x27;through&#x27; + &#x27;be visible&#x27;.
* late 16th century (in the Latin sense): from Latin - &#x27;shining through&#x27;, from the verb , from - &#x27;through&#x27; + &#x27;to shine&#x27;.
* late Middle English , from Latin &#x27;darkened&#x27;. The current spelling (rare before the 19th century) has been influenced by the French form.

== Introduction ==

With regard to the absorption of light, primary material considerations include:
* At the electronic level, absorption in the ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) portions of the spectrum depends on whether the electron orbitals are spaced (or &quot;quantized&quot;) such that electrons can absorb a quantum of light (or photon) of a specific frequency. For example, in most glasses, electrons have no available energy levels above them in the range of that associated with visible light, or if they do, the transition to them would violate selection rules, meaning there is no appreciable absorption in pure (undoped) glasses, making them ideal transparent materials for windows in buildings.
* At the atomic or molecular level, physical absorption in the infrared portion of the spectrum depends on the frequencies of atomic or molecular vibrations or chemical bonds, and on selection rules. Nitrogen and oxygen are not greenhouse gases because there is no molecular dipole moment.

With regard to the scattering of light, the most critical factor is the length scale of any or all of these structural features relative to the wavelength of the light being scattered. Primary material considerations include:
* Crystalline structure: whether the atoms or molecules exhibit the &#x27;long-range order&#x27; evidenced in crystalline solids.
* Glassy structure: Scattering centers include fluctuations in density or composition.
* Microstructure: Scattering centers include internal surfaces such as grain boundaries, crystallographic defects, and microscopic pores.
* Organic materials: Scattering centers include fiber and cell structures and boundaries.

Diffuse reflection - Generally, when light strikes the surface of a (non-metallic and non-glassy) solid material, it bounces off in all directions due to multiple reflections by the microscopic irregularities &quot;inside&quot; the material (e.g., the grain boundaries of a polycrystalline material or the cell or fiber boundaries of an organic material), and by its surface, if it is rough. Diffuse reflection is typically characterized by omni-directional reflection angles. Most of the objects visible to the naked eye are identified via diffuse reflection. Another term commonly used for this type of reflection is &quot;light scattering&quot;. Light scattering from the surfaces of objects is our primary mechanism of physical observation.

Light scattering in liquids and solids depends on the wavelength of the light being scattered. Limits to spatial scales of visibility (using white light) therefore arise, depending on the frequency of the light wave and the physical dimension (or spatial scale) of the scattering center. Visible light has a wavelength scale on the order of 0.5 μm. Scattering centers (or particles) as small as 1 μm have been observed directly in the light microscope (e.g., Brownian motion).

=== Transparent ceramics ===
Optical transparency in polycrystalline materials is limited by the amount of light scattered by their microstructural features. Light scattering depends on the wavelength of the light. Limits to spatial scales of visibility (using white light) therefore arise, depending on the frequency of the light wave and the physical dimension of the scattering center. For example, since visible light has a wavelength scale on the order of a micrometre, scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale. Primary scattering centers in polycrystalline materials include microstructural defects such as pores and grain boundaries. In addition to pores, most of the interfaces in a typical metal or ceramic object are in the form of grain boundaries, which separate tiny regions of crystalline order. When the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent.

In the formation of polycrystalline materials (metals and ceramics) the size of the crystalline grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline particles present in the raw material during formation (or pressing) of the object. Moreover, the size of the grain boundaries scales directly with particle size. Thus, a reduction of the original particle size well below the wavelength of visible light (about 1/15 of the light wavelength, or roughly 600 nm / 15 = 40 nm) eliminates much of the light scattering, resulting in a translucent or even transparent material.

Computer modeling of light transmission through translucent ceramic alumina has shown that microscopic pores trapped near grain boundaries act as primary scattering centers. The volume fraction of porosity had to be reduced below 1% for high-quality optical transmission (99.99 percent of theoretical density). This goal has been readily accomplished and amply demonstrated in laboratories and research facilities worldwide using the emerging chemical processing methods encompassed by the methods of sol-gel chemistry and nanotechnology.
Transparent ceramics have created interest in their applications for high energy lasers, transparent armor windows, nose cones for heat seeking missiles, radiation detectors for non-destructive testing, high energy physics, space exploration, security and medical imaging applications. Large laser elements made from transparent ceramics can be produced at a relatively low cost. These components are free of internal stress or intrinsic birefringence, and allow relatively large doping levels or optimized custom-designed doping profiles. This makes ceramic laser elements particularly important for high-energy lasers.

The development of transparent panel products will have other potential advanced applications including high strength, impact-resistant materials that can be used for domestic windows and skylights. Perhaps more important is that walls and other applications will have improved overall strength, especially for high-shear conditions found in high seismic and wind exposures. If the expected improvements in mechanical properties bear out, the traditional limits seen on glazing areas in today&#x27;s building codes could quickly become outdated if the window area actually contributes to the shear resistance of the wall.

Currently available infrared transparent materials typically exhibit a trade-off between optical performance, mechanical strength and price. For example, sapphire (crystalline alumina) is very strong, but it is expensive and lacks full transparency throughout the 3–5 μm mid-infrared range. Yttria is fully transparent from 3–5 μm, but lacks sufficient strength, hardness, and thermal shock resistance for high-performance aerospace applications. A combination of these two materials in the form of the yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) is one of the top performers in the field.

== Absorption of light in solids ==

When light strikes an object, it usually has not just a single frequency (or wavelength) but many. Objects have a tendency to selectively absorb, reflect, or transmit light of certain frequencies. That is, one object might reflect green light while absorbing all other frequencies of visible light. Another object might selectively transmit blue light while absorbing all other frequencies of visible light. The manner in which visible light interacts with an object is dependent upon the frequency of the light, the nature of the atoms in the object, and often, the nature of the electrons in the atoms of the object.

Some materials allow much of the light that falls on them to be transmitted through the material without being reflected. Materials that allow the transmission of light waves through them are called optically transparent. Chemically pure (undoped) window glass and clean river or spring water are prime examples of this.

Materials that do not allow the transmission of any light wave frequencies are called opaque. Such substances may have a chemical composition which includes what are referred to as absorption centers. Most materials are composed of materials that are selective in their absorption of light frequencies. Thus they absorb only certain portions of the visible spectrum. The frequencies of the spectrum which are not absorbed are either reflected back or transmitted for our physical observation. In the visible portion of the spectrum, this is what gives rise to color.

Absorption centers are largely responsible for the appearance of specific wavelengths of visible light all around us. Moving from longer (0.7 μm) to shorter (0.4 μm) wavelengths: Red, orange, yellow, green, and blue (ROYGB) can all be identified by our senses in the appearance of color by the selective absorption of specific light wave frequencies (or wavelengths). Mechanisms of selective light wave absorption include:

*Electronic: Transitions in electron energy levels within the atom (e.g., pigments). These transitions are typically in the ultraviolet (UV) and/or visible portions of the spectrum.
*Vibrational: Resonance in atomic/molecular vibrational modes. These transitions are typically in the infrared portion of the spectrum.

=== UV-Vis: electronic transitions ===
In electronic absorption, the frequency of the incoming light wave is at or near the energy levels of the electrons within the atoms that compose the substance. In this case, the electrons will absorb the energy of the light wave and increase their energy state, often moving outward from the nucleus of the atom into an outer shell or orbital.

The atoms that bind together to make the molecules of any particular substance contain a number of electrons (given by the atomic number Z in the periodic table). Recall that all light waves are electromagnetic in origin. Thus they are affected strongly when coming into contact with negatively charged electrons in matter. When photons (individual packets of light energy) come in contact with the valence electrons of an atom, one of several things can and will occur:
* A molecule absorbs the photon, some of the energy may be lost via luminescence, fluorescence and phosphorescence.
* A molecule absorbs the photon, which results in reflection or scattering.
* A molecule cannot absorb the energy of the photon and the photon continues on its path. This results in transmission (provided no other absorption mechanisms are active).

Most of the time, it is a combination of the above that happens to the light that hits an object. The states in different materials vary in the range of energy that they can absorb. Most glasses, for example, block ultraviolet (UV) light. What happens is the electrons in the glass absorb the energy of the photons in the UV range while ignoring the weaker energy of photons in the visible light spectrum. But there are also existing special glass types, like special types of borosilicate glass or quartz that are UV-permeable and thus allow a high transmission of ultraviolet light.

Thus, when a material is illuminated, individual photons of light can make the valence electrons of an atom transition to a higher electronic energy level. The photon is destroyed in the process and the absorbed radiant energy is transformed to electric potential energy. Several things can happen, then, to the absorbed energy: It may be re-emitted by the electron as radiant energy (in this case, the overall effect is in fact a scattering of light), dissipated to the rest of the material (i.e., transformed into heat), or the electron can be freed from the atom (as in the photoelectric effects and Compton effects).

=== Infrared: bond stretching ===

The primary physical mechanism for storing mechanical energy of motion in condensed matter is through heat, or thermal energy. Thermal energy manifests itself as energy of motion. Thus, heat is motion at the atomic and molecular levels. The primary mode of motion in crystalline substances is vibration. Any given atom will vibrate around some mean or average position within a crystalline structure, surrounded by its nearest neighbors. This vibration in two dimensions is equivalent to the oscillation of a clock&#x27;s pendulum. It swings back and forth symmetrically about some mean or average (vertical) position. Atomic and molecular vibrational frequencies may average on the order of 1012 cycles per second (Terahertz radiation).

When a light wave of a given frequency strikes a material with particles having the same or (resonant) vibrational frequencies, those particles will absorb the energy of the light wave and transform it into thermal energy of vibrational motion. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared light. Reflection and transmission of light waves occur because the frequencies of the light waves do not match the natural resonant frequencies of vibration of the objects. When infrared light of these frequencies strikes an object, the energy is reflected or transmitted.

If the object is transparent, then the light waves are passed on to neighboring atoms through the bulk of the material and re-emitted on the opposite side of the object. Such frequencies of light waves are said to be transmitted.

=== Transparency in insulators ===
An object may be not transparent either because it reflects the incoming light or because it absorbs the incoming light. Almost all solids reflect a part and absorb a part of the incoming light.

When light falls onto a block of metal, it encounters atoms that are tightly packed in a regular lattice and a &quot;sea of electrons&quot; moving randomly between the atoms. In metals, most of these are non-bonding electrons (or free electrons) as opposed to the bonding electrons typically found in covalently bonded or ionically bonded non-metallic (insulating) solids. In a metallic bond, any potential bonding electrons can easily be lost by the atoms in a crystalline structure. The effect of this delocalization is simply to exaggerate the effect of the &quot;sea of electrons&quot;. As a result of these electrons, most of the incoming light in metals is reflected back, which is why we see a shiny metal surface.

Most insulators (or dielectric materials) are held together by ionic bonds. Thus, these materials do not have free conduction electrons, and the bonding electrons reflect only a small fraction of the incident wave. The remaining frequencies (or wavelengths) are free to propagate (or be transmitted). This class of materials includes all ceramics and glasses.

If a dielectric material does not include light-absorbent additive molecules (pigments, dyes, colorants), it is usually transparent to the spectrum of visible light. Color centers (or dye molecules, or &quot;dopants&quot;) in a dielectric absorb a portion of the incoming light. The remaining frequencies (or wavelengths) are free to be reflected or transmitted. This is how colored glass is produced.

Most liquids and aqueous solutions are highly transparent. For example, water, cooking oil, rubbing alcohol, air, and natural gas are all clear. Absence of structural defects (voids, cracks, etc.) and molecular structure of most liquids are chiefly responsible for their excellent optical transmission. The ability of liquids to &quot;heal&quot; internal defects via viscous flow is one of the reasons why some fibrous materials (e.g., paper or fabric) increase their apparent transparency when wetted. The liquid fills up numerous voids making the material more structurally homogeneous.

Light scattering in an ideal defect-free crystalline (non-metallic) solid that provides &quot;no scattering centers&quot; for incoming light will be due primarily to any effects of anharmonicity within the ordered lattice. Light transmission will be highly directional due to the typical anisotropy of crystalline substances, which includes their symmetry group and Bravais lattice. For example, the seven different crystalline forms of quartz silica (silicon dioxide, SiO2) are all clear, transparent materials.

== Optical waveguides ==


Optically transparent materials focus on the response of a material to incoming light waves of a range of wavelengths. Guided light wave transmission via frequency selective waveguides involves the emerging field of fiber optics and the ability of certain glassy compositions to act as a transmission medium for a range of frequencies simultaneously (multi-mode optical fiber) with little or no interference between competing wavelengths or frequencies. This resonant mode of energy and data transmission via electromagnetic (light) wave propagation is relatively lossless.

An optical fiber is a cylindrical dielectric waveguide that transmits light along its axis by the process of total internal reflection. The fiber consists of a core surrounded by a cladding layer. To confine the optical signal in the core, the refractive index of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The refractive index is the parameter reflecting the speed of light in a material. (Refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in a given medium. The refractive index of vacuum is therefore 1.) The larger the refractive index, the more slowly light travels in that medium. Typical values for core and cladding of an optical fiber are 1.48 and 1.46, respectively.

When light traveling in a dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle, the light will be completely reflected. This effect, called total internal reflection, is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels along the fiber bouncing back and forth off of the boundary. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the critical angle, only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles will be propagated. This range of angles is called the acceptance cone of the fiber. The size of this acceptance cone is a function of the refractive index difference between the fiber&#x27;s core and cladding. Optical waveguides are used as components in integrated optical circuits (e.g., combined with lasers or light-emitting diodes, LEDs) or as the transmission medium in local and long-haul optical communication systems.

=== Mechanisms of attenuation ===
Attenuation in fiber optics, also known as &quot;transmission loss&quot;, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) with respect to distance traveled through a transmission medium. It is an important factor limiting the transmission of a signal across large distances. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the very high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. 

In optical fibers, the main source of attenuation is scattering from molecular level irregularities, called Rayleigh scattering, due to structural disorder and compositional fluctuations of the glass structure. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of infrared missile domes. Further attenuation is caused by light absorbed by residual materials, such as metals or water ions, within the fiber core and inner cladding. Light leakage due to bending, splices, connectors, or other outside forces are other factors resulting in attenuation. At high optical powers, scattering can also be caused by nonlinear optical processes in the fiber.

== As camouflage ==

Many marine animals that float near the surface are highly transparent, giving them almost perfect camouflage. However, transparency is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different refractive indices from seawater. Some marine animals such as jellyfish have gelatinous bodies, composed mainly of water; their thick mesogloea is acellular and highly transparent. This conveniently makes them buoyant, but it also makes them large for their muscle mass, so they cannot swim fast, making this form of camouflage a costly trade-off with mobility. Gelatinous planktonic animals are between 50 and 90 percent transparent. A transparency of 50 percent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as cod at a depth of ; better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water, where the light is brighter and predators can see better. For example, a cod can see prey that are 98 percent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water. Therefore, sufficient transparency for camouflage is more easily achieved in deeper waters. For the same reason, transparency in air is even harder to achieve, but a partial example is found in the 
glass frogs of the South American rain forest, which have translucent skin and pale greenish limbs. Several Central American species of clearwing (ithomiine) butterflies and many dragonflies and allied insects also have wings which are mostly transparent, a form of crypsis that provides some protection from predators.

<text>A transparency, also known variously as a viewfoil or foil (from the French word &quot;feuille&quot; or sheet), or viewgraph, is a thin sheet of transparent flexible material, typically polyester (historically cellulose acetate), onto which figures can be drawn. These are then placed on an overhead projector for display to an audience. Many companies and small organizations use a system of projectors and transparencies in meetings and other groupings of people, though this system is being largely replaced by video projectors and interactive whiteboards.

== Printing ==
Transparencies can be printed using a variety of technologies. In the 1960s and 70s the GAF OZALID &quot;projecto-viewfoil&quot; used a diazo process to make a clear sheet framed in cardboard and protected by a rice paper cover. In the 1980&#x27;s laser printers or copiers could make foil sheets using standard xerographic processes. Specialist transparencies are available for use with laser printers that are better able to handle the high temperatures present in the fuser unit. For inkjet printers, coated transparencies are available that can absorb and hold the liquid ink—although care must be taken to avoid excessive exposure to moisture, which can cause the transparency to become cloudy; they must also be loaded correctly into the printer as they are only usually coated on one side.

== Uses ==
Uses for transparencies are as varied as the organizations that use them.

Certain classes, such as those associated with mathematics or history and geography use transparencies to illustrate a point or problem. Until the advent of LaTeX, math classes in particular used rolls of acetate to illustrate sufficiently long problems and to display mathematical symbols missing from common computer keyboards.

Aerospace companies, like Boeing and Beechcraft, used transparencies for years in management meetings in order to brief engineers and relevant personnel about new aircraft designs and changes to existing designs, as well as bring up illustrated problems.

Some churches and other religious organizations used them to show sermon outlines and illustrate certain topics such as Old Testament battles and Jewish artifacts during worship services, as well as outline business meetings.

== Spatial light modulators (SLMs) ==
Many overhead projectors are used with a flat-panel LCD which, when used this way, is referred to as a spatial light modulator or SLM. Data projectors are often based on some form of SLM in a projection path. An LCD is a transmissive SLM, whereas other technologies such as Texas Instrument&#x27;s DLP are reflective SLMs. Not all projectors use SLMs (e.g., some use devices that produce their own light rather than function as transparencies). An example of non-SLM system are organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).

<text>The PS &quot;General Slocum&quot; was an American sidewheel passenger steamboat built in Brooklyn, New York, in 1891. During her service history, she was involved in a number of mishaps, including multiple groundings and collisions.

On June 15, 1904, &quot;General Slocum&quot; caught fire and sank in the East River of New York City. At the time of the disaster, she was on a chartered run carrying members of St. Mark&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran Church (German Americans from Little Germany, Manhattan) to a church picnic. An estimated 1,021 out of the 1,342 people on board died.

The &quot;General Slocum&quot; disaster was the worst maritime disaster of the 20th century until the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; surpassed it eight years later in 1912. It remains the worst maritime disaster in New York City history, and the second-worst on U.S. waterways, after the explosion and sinking of the steamboat &quot;Sultana&quot;, and until the September 11 attacks in 2001 was the deadliest manmade disaster of any sort in the New York area.

The events surrounding the &quot;General Slocum&quot; fire have been explored in a number of books, plays, and movies.

==Construction and design==

The hull of &quot;General Slocum&quot; was built by Divine Burtis Jr., a Brooklyn boatbuilder who was awarded the contract on February 15, 1891; the superstructure was built by John E. Hoffmire &amp; Son. Her keel was long and the hull was wide constructed of white oak and yellow pine. &quot;General Slocum&quot; measured 1,284 tons gross, and had a hull depth of . She was constructed with three decks (main, promenade and hurricane), three watertight compartments and 250 electric lights. She drew unladen and was long overall.

&quot;General Slocum&quot; was powered by a single-cylinder, surface-condensing vertical-beam steam engine with a bore and stroke, built by W. &amp; A. Fletcher Company of Hoboken, New Jersey. Steam was supplied by two boilers at a working pressure of . &quot;General Slocum&quot; was a sidewheel boat. Each wheel had 26 paddles and was in diameter. Her maximum speed was about . The ship was usually crewed by a contingent of 22, including Captain William H. Van Schaick and two pilots. She had a legal capacity of 2,500 passengers.

Cabins, storeroom, and machinery spaces were below the main deck. Crew quarters were the second compartment aft from the bow, with a hatch and ladder leading to the main deck. Aft of the quarters was the &quot;forward cabin&quot;, also fitted with a companionway to the main deck; it was originally intended to be a cabin space, but had been used as a storeroom and lamp room. The forward cabin also housed the ship&#x27;s steering engine and dynamo. The forward cabin, measuring approximately (length × width), was used for general storage and to store and refuel the ship&#x27;s lamps from oil barrels kept there. Oil had been spilled on the deck of the Lamp Room numerous times, and it was frequented by crew who habitually used open flames in the room. Aft of the forward cabin was the machinery space for engines and boilers. The stern compartment below the main deck (aft of the machinery) was used as an aftersaloon.

The forward part of the main deck was enclosed just forward of the companionway to the forward cabin. The promenade deck, above the main deck, was open except for a small section amidships. The hurricane deck, above the promenade, was where the lifeboats and life rafts were stowed. The pilot house was above the hurricane deck, with a small stateroom immediately aft.

==Service history==
&quot;General Slocum&quot; was named for Civil War General and New York Congressman Henry Warner Slocum. She was owned by the Knickerbocker Steamboat Company. She operated in the New York City area as an excursion steamer for the next 13 years under the same ownership.

&quot;General Slocum&quot; experienced a series of mishaps following her launch in 1891. Four months after her launching, she ran aground off Rockaway. Tugboats had to pull her free.

A number of incidents occurred during 1894. On July 29, while returning from Rockaway with about 4,700 passengers, &quot;General Slocum&quot; struck a sandbar with enough force to knock out her electrical generator. The next month, &quot;General Slocum&quot; ran aground off Coney Island during a storm. Passengers had to be transferred to another ship. In September 1894, &quot;General Slocum&quot; collided with the tug &quot;R. T. Sayre&quot; in the East River, causing substantial damage to &quot;General Slocum&#x27;s&quot; steering.

In July 1898, &quot;General Slocum&quot; collided with the &quot;Amelia&quot; near Battery Park. On August 17, 1901, while carrying what was described as 900 intoxicated anarchists from Paterson, New Jersey, some of the passengers started a riot on board and tried to take control of the vessel. The crew fought back and kept control of the ship. The captain docked the ship at the police pier, and police took 17 men into custody.

In June 1902, &quot;General Slocum&quot; ran aground with 400 passengers aboard. Passengers had to camp out overnight while the ship remained stuck.

==1904 disaster==

&quot;General Slocum&quot; worked as a passenger ship, taking people on excursions around New York City. On Wednesday, June 15, 1904, the ship had been chartered for $350 by St. Mark&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Little Germany district of Manhattan. This was an annual rite for the group, which had made the trip for 17 consecutive years. Nearly 1,400 passengers, mostly women and children, boarded &quot;General Slocum&quot;, which was to sail up the East River and then eastward across the Long Island Sound to Locust Grove, a picnic site in Eatons Neck, Long Island. The official post-disaster report stated there were 1,358 passengers and 30 officers and crew; fewer than 150 of the passengers were estimated to be adult males over 21. Of those on board, there were 957 deaths and 180 injuries. Less than twenty minutes elapsed between the start of the fire and the collapse of the hurricane deck.

===The fire===

The ship got underway from the recreation pier at Third Street on the East River at 9:30 am; it passed west of Blackwell Island (now Roosevelt Island) and turned east, remaining south of Wards Island. As it was passing East 90th Street, a fire started in the forward cabin or Lamp Room, the third compartment aft from the bow under the main deck; the fire was possibly caused by a discarded cigarette or match. The disastrous fire was fueled by the straw, oily rags, and lamp oil strewn around the room. The first notice of a fire was at 10 a.m.; eyewitnesses claimed the initial blaze began in various locations, including a paint locker filled with flammable liquids and a cabin filled with gasoline. Passengers on the main deck were aware of the fire at the entrance to Hell Gate. Captain Van Schaick was not notified until 10 minutes after the fire was discovered. A 12-year-old boy had tried to warn him earlier, but was not believed. After he was notified of the fire, Van Schaick ordered full speed ahead; approximately 30 seconds later, he directed the pilot to beach the ship on North Brother Island. Following this last command, Van Schaick descended to the hurricane deck and remained there until he was able to jump into shallow water after the ship was beached.

Although the captain was ultimately responsible for the safety of passengers, the owners had made no effort to maintain or replace the ship&#x27;s safety equipment. The main deck was equipped with a standpipe connected to a steam pump, but the fire hose attached to the forward end of the standpipe, a length of &quot;cheap unlined linen,&quot; had been allowed to rot and burst in several places. When the crew tried to put out the fire; they were unable to attach a rubber hose because the coupling of the linen hose remained attached to the standpipe. The ship was also equipped with hand pumps and buckets, but they were not used during the disaster; the crew gave up firefighting efforts after failing to attach the rubber hose. The crew had not practiced a fire drill that year, and the lifeboats were tied up and inaccessible. Some claimed the lifeboats were wired and painted in place.

Survivors reported that the life preservers were useless and fell apart in their hands, while desperate mothers placed life jackets on their children and tossed them into the water, only to watch in horror as their children sank instead of floating. Most of those on board were women and children who, like most Americans of the time, could not swim; victims found that their heavy wool clothing absorbed water and weighed them down in the river.

It was discovered that Nonpareil Cork Works, supplier of cork materials to manufacturers of life preservers, placed iron bars inside the cork materials to meet minimum content requirements ( of &quot;good cork&quot;) at the time. Nonpareil&#x27;s deception was revealed by David Kahnweiler&#x27;s Sons, who inspected a shipment of 300 cork blocks. Many of the life preservers had been filled with cheap and less effective granulated cork and brought up to proper weight by the inclusion of the iron weights. Canvas covers, rotted with age, split and scattered the powdered cork. Managers of the company (Nonpareil Cork Works) were indicted but not convicted. The life preservers on the &quot;Slocum&quot; had been manufactured in 1891 and had hung above the deck, unprotected from the elements, for 13 years.

===Beaching on North Brother Island===

Captain Van Schaick decided to continue his course rather than run the ship aground or stop at a nearby landing. By going into headwinds and failing to immediately ground the ship, he fanned the fire and promoted its spread from fore to aft; the investigating commission later faulted Van Schaick for passing up opportunities to beach the vessel in Little Hell Gate (west of the Sunken Meadows) or the Bronx Bills (east of the Sunken Meadows), which also would have put the prevailing winds astern, keeping flames from spreading along the length of the ship. Van Schaick later argued he was trying to avoid having the fire spread to riverside buildings and oil tanks. Flammable paint also helped the fire spread out of control, driven aft mainly along the port side of the ship; passengers, who were on the upper promenade and hurricane decks, were forced into the aft starboard quarter.

Ten minutes after the ship was beached, the fire had essentially engulfed the vessel; no more than twenty minutes had elapsed since the first flames came up from the Lamp Room. Some passengers jumped into the river to escape the fire, but the heavy women&#x27;s clothing of the day made swimming almost impossible and dragged them underwater to drown. An estimated 100 to 500 died when the overloaded starboard section of the hurricane deck collapsed, casting those passengers into deep water, and others were battered by the still-turning paddles as they tried to escape into the water or over the sides. The commission estimated that 400 to 600 people drowned after the ship was beached, as they jumped off the aft portion of the boat into deep water; those jumping off the bow landed in shallower water.

&quot;General Slocum&quot; remained beached on North Brother Island for approximately 90 minutes before breaking free and drifting east for approximately ; by the time she sank in shallow water off the Bronx shore at Hunts Point,  an estimated 1,021 people, including 2 of the 30 crew members, had either burned to death or drowned. There were 431 survivors. The actions of two tugboats which arrived a few minutes after the &quot;Slocum&quot; was beached were credited with saving between 200 and 350 people.

The 1904 Coast Guard Report estimated the following figures for casualties of a total of 1,388 persons involved in the disaster:

The captain lost sight in one eye owing to the fire. Reports indicate that Captain Van Schaick deserted &quot;General Slocum&quot; as soon as it settled, jumping into a nearby tug, along with several crew. He was hospitalized at Lebanon Hospital.

Many acts of heroism were performed by the passengers, witnesses, and emergency personnel. Staff and patients from the hospital on North Brother Island participated in the rescue efforts, forming human chains and pulling victims from the water.

=== Aftermath ===
Eight people were indicted by a federal grand jury after the disaster: the captain, two inspectors, and the president, secretary, treasurer, and commodore of the Knickerbocker Steamship Company.

Most boatmen felt that Van Schaick &quot;was unjustly made a scapegoat for the resulting tragedy, instead of the owners of the steamer or the effectiveness of the life saving and fire fighting equipment then required — and the inspections of it by government inspectors&quot;. He was the only person convicted. He was found guilty on one of three charges: criminal negligence, for failing to maintain proper fire drills and fire extinguishers. The jury could not reach a verdict on the other two counts of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. He spent three years and six months at Sing Sing prison before he was paroled. President Theodore Roosevelt declined to pardon Van Schaick. Van Schaick was finally released when the federal parole board under the William Howard Taft administration voted to free him on August 26, 1911. He was pardoned by President Taft on December 19, 1912; the pardon became effective on Christmas Day. After his death in 1927, Schaick was buried in Oakwood Cemetery (Troy, New York).

The Knickerbocker Steamship Company, which owned the ship, paid a relatively small fine despite evidence that they might have falsified inspection records. The disaster motivated federal and state regulation to improve the emergency equipment on passenger ships.

The neighborhood of Little Germany, which had been in decline for some time before the disaster as residents moved uptown, almost disappeared afterward. With the trauma and arguments that followed the tragedy and the loss of many prominent settlers, most of the Lutheran Germans remaining in the Lower East Side eventually moved uptown. The church whose congregation chartered the ship for the fateful voyage was converted to a synagogue in 1940 after the area was settled by Jewish residents.

The victims were interred in cemeteries around New York, with 58 identified victims buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens, and 46 identified victims buried in Green-Wood Cemetery, both in Brooklyn. Many victims were buried at Lutheran Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens (now Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery) where an annual memorial ceremony is held at the historical marker.

In 1906, a marble memorial fountain was erected in the north central part of Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan by the Sympathy Society of German Ladies, with the inscription: &quot;They are Earth&#x27;s purest children, young and fair.&quot;

The sunken remains of &quot;General Slocum&quot; were salvaged and converted into a 625-gross register ton barge named &quot;Maryland&quot;, which sank in the South River in 1909 and again in the Atlantic Ocean off the southeast coast of New Jersey near Strathmere and Sea Isle City during a storm on December 4, 1911, while carrying a cargo of coal. All four people aboard &quot;Maryland&quot; survived the sinking.

The victims included one Emily Ziegler, the girlfriend of a saloonkeeper named John Flammang Schrank who later suffered a mental breakdown culminating in an attempted assassination of Theodore Roosevelt.

===Survivors===
On January 26, 2004, the last surviving passenger from &quot;General Slocum&quot;, Adella Wotherspoon (née Liebenow), died at the age of 100. At the time of the disaster, she was a six-month-old infant. Wotherspoon was the youngest survivor of the tragedy that took the lives of her two older sisters. When she was one year old, she unveiled the Steamboat Fire Mass Memorial on June 15, 1905, at Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery, in Middle Village, Queens. Before Wotherspoon&#x27;s death, the previous oldest survivor was Catherine Connelly (née Uhlmyer) (1893–2002) who was 11 years old at the time of the disaster.

<doc id="351084" wikidata="Q568753" url="?curid=351084" title="Transparency (market)">
<text>In economics, a market is transparent if much is known by many about: What products and services or capital assets are available, market depth (quantity available), what price, and where. Transparency is important since it is one of the theoretical conditions required for a free market to be efficient. Price transparency can, however, lead to higher prices. For example, if it makes sellers reluctant to give steep discounts to certain buyers (e.g. disrupting price dispersion among buyers), or if it facilitates collusion, and price volatility is another concern. A high degree of market transparency can result in disintermediation due to the buyer&#x27;s increased knowledge of supply pricing.

There are two types of price transparency: 1) I know what price will be charged to me, and 2) I know what price will be charged to you. The two types of price transparency have different implications for differential pricing. A transparent market should also provide necessary information about quality and other product features, although quality can be exceedingly difficult to estimate for some goods, such as artworks.

While the stock market is relatively transparent, hedge funds are notoriously secretive. Researchers in this area have found concerns by hedge funds about the crowding out of their trades through transparency and undesirable effects of incomplete transparency. Some financial professionals, including Wall Street veteran Jeremy Frommer are pioneering the application of transparency to hedge funds by broadcasting live from trading desks and posting detailed portfolios online.

In the United States, the goal of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) is to foster greater transparency in business ownership within the United States. By mandating companies to disclose their beneficial owners to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the CTA aims to curb illicit financial activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing. This requirement seeks to enhance accountability and deter the misuse of anonymous shell corporations for unlawful purposes. Ultimately, the CTA seeks to promote integrity in corporate governance and bolster confidence in the U.S. financial system by ensuring that the true individuals behind corporate entities are known and accountable.

== Critical transparency ==
There is a rich literature in accounting that takes a critical perspective to market transparency, focusing on the nuances and boundaries. For example, some researchers question its utility (e.g. Etzioni). This also connects to the performativity of quantitative models or &quot;reactivity&quot;. Specific cases include transparency in the art market. There are also studies from finance that note concerns with market transparency, such as perverse effects including decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. This is one motivation for markets that are selectively transparent, such as &quot;dark pools&quot;.

Dynamics of transparency may also differ between investment markets, cambist markets where goods trade without being used up, and other types of markets, e.g. goods and services.

In fair value accounting (FVA), transparency may be complicated by the fact that level 2 and 3 assets cannot strictly be marked-to-market, given that no direct market exists, creating questions about what transparency means for these assets. Level 2 assets may be marked-to-model, a topic of interest in the social studies of finance, while Level 3 assets may require inputs including management expectations or assumptions.

==In the Forex market==

There are few markets that require the level of privacy, honesty, and trust between its participants as the Forex (FX) market. This creates great obstacles for traders, investors, and institutions to overcome as there is a lack of transparency, leading to the need to develop trust with trading partners and developing these relationships through social means, such as &quot;gifts of information&quot;, which is even seen on the trading floors of global investment banks that service institutional investors.

With little to no transparency, trader&#x27;s ability to verify transactions becomes virtually impossible, at least if one does not have faith that the market exchange is operating in a well-run fashion, a problem that is unlikely with the major brokerage services open to institutional investors (e.g. Reuters, Bloomberg, and Telerate). In a situation with a problematic market exchange lacking transparency, there would be no trust between the client and the broker, yet surprisingly, there is nonetheless demand to trade in dark pools. This has also become an area of financial innovation.

Forex markets are now also a target for new blockchain innovations, which would allow trading outside of centralized exchanges or change the way these exchanges operate.

<text>The Belgian Grand Prix (; ; ) is a motor racing event which forms part of the Formula One World Championship.
The first national race of Belgium was held in 1925 at the Spa region&#x27;s race course, an area of the country that had been associated with motor sport since the very early years of racing. To accommodate Grand Prix motor racing, the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps race course was built in 1921 but until 1924 it was used only for motorcycle racing. After the 1923 success of the new 24 hours of Le Mans in France, the Spa 24 Hours, a similar 24-hour endurance race, was run at the Spa track.

Since its inception, Spa-Francorchamps has been known for its unpredictable weather. At one stage in its history it had rained at the Belgian Grand Prix for twenty years in a row. Frequently drivers confront a part of the course that is clear and bright while another stretch is rainy and slippery.

The Belgian Grand Prix was designated the European Grand Prix six times between 1925 and 1973, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe. It is one of the most popular races on the Formula One calendar, due to the scenic and historical Spa-Francorchamps circuit being a favourite of drivers and fans.

==History==

===Spa-Francorchamps (pre-WWII) and Bois de la Cambre===

In 1925, the first Belgian Grand Prix was held at the very fast, 9-mile Spa-Francorchamps circuit located in the Ardennes region of eastern Belgium, about half an hour from Liege. This race was won by the Italian works Alfa driver Antonio Ascari, whose son Alberto would win the race in 1952 and 1953. After winning the Belgian race, Antonio Ascari was killed in his next race at the 1925 French Grand Prix. The Grand Prix did not come back until 1930, and the circuit had been modified, bypassing the Malmedy chicane. The race was won by Louis Chiron, and in 1931, the Grand Prix had become something of an endurance race, with Briton William Grover-Williams and Caberto Conelli winning. 1933 was won by Tazio Nuvolari, and 1935 was won by Rudolf Caracciola in a Mercedes, by which time the circuit had re-installed the Malmedy Chicane. The 1939 race saw the birth of the Raidillon corner; it was a bypass of the Ancienne Douane section. In contrast to popular belief, only the small kink to the left at the bottom of the drop is named Eau Rouge, which directly leads into Raidillon, a very long right uphill corner; and the tricky left blind corner at the top has no name. The conditions were dreadful, and the race was marred by the death of British driver Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Seaman while leading the race. Going into Clubhouse corner, Seaman was pushing hard; he skidded off the rain-soaked road, hit a tree and his Mercedes caught fire. Seaman received life-threatening burns, and he succumbed to his injuries later in hospital. The race was won by Seaman&#x27;s teammate Hermann Lang. World War II broke out, and the Belgian Grand Prix did not return until June 1946, when the 2 to 4.5 litres race at the Bois de la Cambre public park in the Belgian capital of Brussels was won by Frenchman Eugène Chaboud in a Delage.

=== Old Spa-Francorchamps ===
Spa was modified to make it even faster, shortening it to 8.7 miles (14.1 km). All of the slow corners were taken out – the Stavelot hairpin was bypassed and made into a fast banked corner and the Malmedy chicane was also bypassed. At this time, every corner except La Source was ultra-high speed. Spa over this time became known as one of the most extreme, challenging and fearsome circuits in motorsports history. 1950 saw the introduction of the Formula One World Championship; the race was dominated by the Alfa Romeos of Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio and Italian Nino Farina. Their closest challenger, Alberto Ascari, ran into fuel problems and fell back. The race was won by Fangio, and Farina won the next year&#x27;s race in his works Alfa after Fangio dropped back with hub problems. 1953 saw Ascari dominate in his Ferrari while the Maseratis fell apart. Fangio crashed and José Froilán González had a steering failure and stopped out near the banked Stavelot corner. 1955 saw Mercedes dominate, Fangio and his British teammate Stirling Moss led the race distance. Moss followed Fangio closely for most of the race, the Argentine took victory as he had the year before in a Maserati. 1956 saw a wet race, with Moss in a Maserati lead, and Fangio, now driving for Ferrari, made a bad start and dropped to fifth at the start, although he got up to second behind Moss. The track was drying, and Moss lost a wheel at Raidillon corner. He did not hit anything and went back to take over his teammate Cesare Perdisa&#x27;s car and was able to finish 3rd. The gearbox in Fangio&#x27;s car broke, and his teammate Peter Collins won the race.

The 1957 race was cancelled because there was no money for the race to be held, thanks to the extreme prices of fuel in Belgium and the Netherlands caused by the Suez crisis. 1958 saw Spa upgraded with new facilities, a resurfaced track and also the pit straight was made wider. But Spa had gained a reputation as a totally unforgiving, frightening and a very mentally challenging circuit, even in those safety-absent days, and most racing events there – particularly the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa – had smaller-than-average fields because a number of drivers feared the circuit and did not like racing there. The layout was still the same as before, and the extremely small, almost non-existent margin for error as described before had been realised very quickly. The circuit was extremely challenging, mainly because each corner on the circuit was so fast, and also because of the circuit&#x27;s long length in addition to the fact that it was almost exclusively made up of fast corners and straights. The circuit was very fast, and each corner had to be taken correctly to maintain speed through the next one. Lifting off or taking the wrong racing line would result in several seconds being lost. Spa was located in a region where the weather was unpredictable; in many races there, while one part of the track was dry and had sunshine, another at the same time was soaking wet and it was raining there. There were no radios in the days of the old Spa circuit, so drivers had no idea of circuit conditions and could encounter rain without warning, where there had been none on the previous lap. The nature of the circuit meant that cars spinning off could hit telegraph poles, houses, stone walls, embankments or trees. Many drivers were killed or seriously injured at Spa during the 1950s in all disciplines of motorsport that competed there.

1958 was won by Briton Tony Brooks, driving a Vanwall, from his teammate Stirling Moss. The race was not run in 1959, but 1960 was to be one of the darkest weekends in the history of Formula One. Grand Prix racing had moved forward to a new kind of car design – new British independent teams such as Cooper and Lotus had pioneered the rear-mid-engined car, much like the Auto Union Grand Prix cars of the 1930s. These cars were considerably lighter, faster and easier to drive than their front-engined predecessors, and it became obvious that rear-mid-engined cars were the way to go in purpose-built automobile racing. But this new type of cars had not been driven at Spa before, so no one knew how they would perform there. The high-speed bends at Spa were now much faster with these new cars – and in those days, the cars or circuits for that matter had absolutely no safety features of any kind. The cylinder-shaped bodywork was made of very thin highly flammable magnesium or fibreglass, and the tube-frame chassis of that day offered little crash resistance (as opposed to a modern-day monocoque, pioneered by Lotus only a few years later). Cars were not crash-tested and lacked roll bars (made mandatory in 1961) and fire extinguishers. Although drivers did wear helmets, they were made of weak and lightweight material and not scientifically designed or tested. Drivers in those days did not wear seatbelts – they found it preferable to be thrown from a car that might be on fire to reduce the chance of injury or death.

During practice, Stirling Moss, now driving a privately entered Lotus, had a wheel come off his car and he crashed heavily at the Burnenville right-hander. Moss, who was considered one of the best racing drivers in the world at the time, was thrown out of his car and landed unconscious in the middle of the track. The Englishman broke both legs, three vertebrae, several ribs and had many cuts and abrasions; he survived but did not race for most of that year. Briton Mike Taylor, also driving a Lotus, suffered a steering failure and crashed into trees next to the track near Stavelot. Taylor then was trapped in the car for some time with serious head and neck injuries. The accident ended his racing career; he later successfully sued Lotus founder Colin Chapman in British court for sale of faulty machinery. The race itself, however, was to be even more disastrous. On lap 17, Briton Chris Bristow, driving a Cooper, was fighting for sixth with Belgian Willy Mairesse. Bristow had never driven at Spa before, and was regarded as a brash and daring driver who had a reputation for being rather wild; the relatively inexperienced 22-year-old Englishman had been in many accidents during his short career. Mairesse was also known as an aggressive driver who had a win-at-all-costs mentality and was known to be difficult to pass, particularly on his home track. Bristow and Mairesse touched wheels, and the Englishman lost control at Malmedy, overturned and crashed into an embankment on the right side of the track. The car rolled several times, Bristow was thrown from his car and was decapitated by some barbed-wire fencing next to the circuit, killing him instantly; his body partially landed on the track where it stayed for some time. Mairesse continued, but retired from the race later on with gearbox trouble. 5 laps later, 26-year-old Briton Alan Stacey, running in sixth place and driving a works Lotus, suffered a freak accident when he was hit in the face by a bird on the Masta straight not far from where Bristow had been killed. Stacey then lost control of his car at 140 mph (228 km/h) and it climbed up and flew off an embankment next to the track. After penetrating 10 feet of thick bushes, the car landed on a spot in a field some 25 feet lower than the track. On impact with the field, it then exploded and burst into flames, killing him. It was not known whether the impact broke his neck or if the fire burned him alive while unconscious. Australian Jack Brabham won the race, and British future great Jim Clark scored his first Formula One points by finishing 5th – but Clark, like a number of other drivers, developed an intense dislike for the circuit after he had to swerve at extreme speeds to avoid running over Bristow&#x27;s headless body. It was the worst Formula One event in terms of fatalities until the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

1961 saw Ferrari make use of their superior horsepower, and they romped home 1–2–3–4, with Phil Hill winning. 1962 saw Clark win his first race, going on to win the next three Belgian Grands Prix. 1963 was a rain-soaked race with Clark finishing 4.5 minutes in front of second-placed Bruce McLaren. 1966 featured cars built under new regulations with the engine capacity up to a maximum of 3 litres from 1.5 – engines had now twice as much horsepower as before. This year saw another rain-soaked race: on the first lap, as the field reached the far side of the circuit, a heavy rainstorm caused seven drivers to hydroplane off at Burnenville. Briton Jackie Stewart had a high speed accident at the Masta Kink, where he went through a woodcutter&#x27;s hut, hit a telegraph pole, and dropped into a much lower part of the circuit where the car landed upside down. The BRM Stewart was driving had bent itself over his legs, so he could not get out by himself and the Scot ended up being stuck in his car for nearly 30 minutes. The fuel tanks, which were bags located inside the car that flanked the driver, had ruptured and were soaking him with flammable fuel, and he also had broken ribs and collarbone. Stewart&#x27;s BRM teammate Graham Hill and Bob Bondurant, both of whom had gone off near Stewart, came to help. Because of the absence of safety precautions in those days, they had to borrow spanners from a nearby spectator, and the two drivers got Stewart out. There were other bad accidents on the circuit; some of the cars were hanging off 30-feet-high ledges. Stewart&#x27;s crash at this race inspired his subsequent crusade for safety at racetracks. There was so much water on the track that the Climax engine in Clark&#x27;s Lotus was flooded and failed. Briton John Surtees won the race in a Ferrari, followed by Austrian Jochen Rindt in a Cooper.

1967 saw American Dan Gurney in his Eagle win after Clark had mechanical problems – it was to be Eagle&#x27;s only F1 victory. Briton Mike Parkes crashed heavily at 150 mph at Blanchimont after slipping on some oil that had dropped off of Jackie Stewart&#x27;s BRM. After his car hit and climbed up an embankment, the works Ferrari driver was thrown out of his car, receiving serious leg and head injuries. He was in a coma for a week, and initially his legs were in danger of needing amputation. He survived, but never raced in Formula One again. 1968 saw a number of firsts: wings as an aerodynamic device were introduced for the first time in Formula One. The European constructors, particularly Colin Chapman and Mauro Forghieri, were influenced by American Jim Hall&#x27;s Chaparral 2E and 2F sports cars&#x27; very large high strutted wings. New Zealander Chris Amon qualified his rear-wing equipped Ferrari on pole position by 4 seconds over Stewart in a Matra. Come race day, McLaren won their first ever victory as a constructor, with its founder Bruce McLaren winning – but the race saw yet another serious accident. Briton Brian Redman crashed his works Cooper heavily at high speed into a parked Ford Cortina road car at Burnenville, and the Cooper caught fire. He was seriously burned and also badly broke his right arm; he did not race for most of that year.

The following season, safety issues came to a head. Average lap speeds were past 150 mph (240 km/h), but the circuit still had virtually no safety features and as a result the race over the years was becoming less and less popular with the drivers. The Grand Prix was scheduled for 8 June 1969 as part of that year&#x27;s season. When Jackie Stewart visited the circuit on behalf of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association he demanded many improvements to safety barriers and road surfaces, in order to make the track safe for racing. When the track owners did not want to pay for the safety improvements, the British, French and Italian teams withdrew from the event, and it was cancelled in early April. The exclusion of the Belgian Grand Prix that year was not popular with the press, particularly British journalist Denis Jenkinson. One last race was held there in 1970 with barriers and a temporary chicane at the fast Malmedy corner installed at the circuit, but even this did not stop the cars still averaging over around the track. The race was won by Mexican Pedro Rodriguez in a BRM with New Zealander Chris Amon finishing 1.1 seconds behind in a March. But Spa was still too fast and too dangerous, and in 1971 the Belgian Grand Prix was cancelled, as the track was not up to mandatory FIA-mandated safety specs that year. The event was then eventually relocated.

===Zolder and Nivelles===

Following that decision, the Belgians decided to alternate their Grand Prix between Zolder in northern Belgium and a circuit at Nivelles-Baulers near Brussels. The first race at Nivelles in 1972 was won by Emerson Fittipaldi. Zolder hosted the race the following year and it was won by Jackie Stewart. Formula One returned to Nivelles in 1974. Once again the race was won by Fittipaldi, but the circuit was unpopular among the Formula One circus and after that event the organizers were unable to sustain a Grand Prix at Nivelles, and the track faded from the racing scene.

The Belgian Grand Prix would be held at Zolder a further nine times. Niki Lauda scored back-to-back victories at the track in 1975 and 1976, and in 1977 Gunnar Nilsson scored his only F1 victory at Zolder. The following year Mario Andretti dominated the race for Lotus, driving the 79 in its debut race. In 1979, Jody Scheckter won the race in his Ferrari, and in 1980 Didier Pironi became a first time winner in his Ligier.

The 1981 meeting was a chaotic event wrapped in the midst of the FISA–FOCA war and the poor conditions of the Zolder circuit, including its very narrow pitlane. During Friday practice, Osella mechanic Giovanni Amadeo was accidentally run over in the pitlane by Argentine Carlos Reutemann. He died of his injuries the day after the race. On race day, as a result of the poor conditions of Zolder and the accident on Friday, there was drivers&#x27; strike which caused the race to be started later than scheduled. Then, when the race started after yet another delay, there was a starting-grid accident involving an Arrows mechanic: Riccardo Patrese stalled his Arrows on the grid, so his mechanic Dave Luckett jumped onto the circuit to try and start Patrese&#x27;s car; however, the organizers started the race and the whole field went into motion while Luckett was still on the road. Next, the other Arrows driver, Italian Siegfried Stohr, hit the back of Patrese&#x27;s car, where Luckett was standing. Luckett was knocked unconscious and laid sprawled on the circuit. Then, when the field reached the pit straight again (by which time Luckett had been removed from the road, although the track still had Stohr&#x27;s broken Arrows car on the circuit and the surface was littered with debris) a number of track marshals jumped onto the tarmac and frantically waved their arms to try to make the field stop while waving yellow flags instead of red flags. The cars went by at full racing speeds. When they came back again for the third lap they voluntarily stopped themselves. The race was restarted and was won by Reutemann. Luckett survived the incident, but neither Patrese nor Stohr started the second race.

Gilles Villeneuve died during practice at Zolder in 1982 after a collision with West German Jochen Mass going into the fast Butte corner. Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari flipped a number of times and the Canadian was thrown out of his car during the accident; he was severely injured and died during the night at a hospital near the circuit. John Watson won the race for McLaren.

=== Return to Spa-Francorchamps ===
Spa-Francorchamps had been shortened to 4.3 mi (7 km) in 1979; the parts that went into and through the urban countryside that swept past towns and other obstructions had been cut out and replaced with a new series of corners right before the Les Combes left-hand corner, and the new track rejoined the old on the straight leading up to Blanchimont. The first race at the shortened Spa circuit was won by Frenchman Alain Prost, and the circuit was an immediate hit with drivers, teams and fans.

The Belgian Grand Prix returned to Zolder in 1984 and this was the last F1 race held at the Flemish circuit with Italian Michele Alboreto taking victory in a Ferrari.

1985 saw the event postponed because of a new asphalt that had been laid down specifically to help the cars on the often rain-soaked Spa circuit. But to the embarrassment of the organizers, the weather was hot, and the track surface broke up so badly the drivers could not drive on it. The event was moved from its original date in early June to mid-September. When mid-September came around, Brazilian Ayrton Senna took his first of five Belgian Grands Prix in a wet/dry race, driving a Lotus. Nigel Mansell dominated the 1986 event, and he and Senna took each other out the following year when Mansell attempted to pass the Brazilian on the outside of a wide corner. Senna won the next four Belgian Grands Prix, the first two being rain-soaked events. The 1988 event was the first Belgian Grand Prix to be held in late August/early September instead of May or June (excluding the rescheduled 1985 event) and it has remained in this time frame ever since. The 1990 event had to be restarted twice after a multi-car accident at the La Source hairpin on the first start and then Paolo Barilla crashing at Eau Rouge on the second start. In 1992 German Michael Schumacher won his first of 91 Grand Prix victories in a Benetton, a year after making his Formula 1 debut at the circuit. Damon Hill won the 1993 event after battling with Senna and Schumacher.

1994 saw a chicane installed at the bottom of Eau Rouge in response to the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola that year. 1995 saw the chicane gone, and Schumacher won this and the next two Belgian Grands Prix. The 1998 event ran in torrential conditions. The race was originally stopped after an accident involving thirteen of the twenty-two runners at the first corner. After the restart, heavy rain caused low visibility, and Michael Schumacher ran into the back of David Coulthard, an event that angered Schumacher so much he stormed into the McLaren garage to confront Coulthard, claiming he had tried to kill him. Coulthard later admitted he had been at fault, due to his own inexperience. Only eight drivers were classified finishers (two of whom were five laps behind, one of whom was Coulthard) and Damon Hill secured a victory ahead of his teammate Ralf Schumacher to record the Jordan team&#x27;s first Formula One win.

Schumacher won his 52nd Grand Prix at Spa in 2001, surpassing Alain Prost&#x27;s all-time record of 51 wins. Schumacher also won his seventh World Drivers&#x27; Championship title at Spa in 2004. There was no Belgian Grand Prix in 2003 because of the country&#x27;s tobacco advertising laws. In 2006, the FIA announced the Belgian Grand Prix would not be on the calendar, since the local authorities would not be able to complete major repair work at Spa-Francorchamps before the September race. The Belgian Grand Prix returned in 2007, when Kimi Räikkönen took pole position and his third Belgian Grand Prix win in a row.

In 2008, McLaren&#x27;s Lewis Hamilton survived a frantic last two laps in a late shower of rain to win the race. Hamilton lost the lead to Ferrari&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen with an early spin but fought back in the closing laps to re-take the lead with two laps to go. On a soaking track, Hamilton passed Räikkönen, lost the lead again with a spin, re-took it and then saw Räikkönen crash. Ferrari&#x27;s Felipe Massa took second leaving him eight points behind Hamilton. However, the stewards decided after the race to apply a 25-second penalty, considered a drive-through penalty under the regulations, for Hamilton&#x27;s pass on Räikkönen after they had deemed that Hamilton had cut a corner in the Bus Stop chicane. This left Hamilton in third place behind Ferrari&#x27;s Felipe Massa and BMW Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld. The penalty cut Hamilton&#x27;s lead over Massa to just two points with five races remaining. McLaren appealed the decision but were turned down as it is not permissible to appeal drive-through penalties. The stewards&#x27; decision was criticised by former world champion Niki Lauda calling it &quot;completely wrong&quot;.

In 2009, Bernie Ecclestone said in an interview that he would like the Belgian Grand Prix to rotate with a Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, rather than the Nürburgring rotating with the Hockenheimring. This rotation never eventualised and the Belgian Grand Prix is contracted to be held through 2022.

The 2021 race became particularly notable for becoming the shortest Formula One World Championship race in history and the only World Championship Grand Prix not to have any running under full green flag conditions in its duration with only two full completed laps completed behind the safety car before the race was red-flagged on lap 3 and not restarted due to adverse weather conditions with the race classification being counted back to the end of lap 1 with Max Verstappen classified first, George Russell second and Lewis Hamilton third, with half points being awarded. The controversy surrounding the awarding of points for this race led to Formula One and the FIA changing the points structure for shortened races ahead of the 2022 Formula One World Championship. The 2022 race was won by Verstappen from 14th, the second lowest position the race has been won from, after Michael Schumacher in 1995. The race&#x27;s contract was extended to the 2023 season. In October 2023 the race&#x27;s contract was extended to the 2025 season. In January 2025 the race&#x27;s contract was extended again and it was announced that the Grand Prix would be held in 4 of the next 6 seasons. With races being held in 2026, 2027, 2029, and 2031.

<doc id="351088" wikidata="Q7834769" url="?curid=351088" title="Transparency (telecommunication)">
<text>In telecommunications, transparency can refer to: 
#The property of an entity that allows another entity to pass through it without altering either of the entities. 
#The property that allows a transmission system or channel to accept, at its input, unmodified user information, and deliver corresponding user information at its output, unchanged in form or information content. The user information may be changed internally within the transmission system, but it is restored to its original form prior to the output without the involvement of the user.
#The quality of a data communications system or device that uses a bit-oriented link protocol that does not depend on the bit sequence structure used by the data source.

Some communication systems are not transparent.
Non-transparent communication systems have one or both of the following problems:
* user data may be incorrectly interpreted as internal commands. For example, modems with a Time Independent Escape Sequence or 20th century Signaling System No. 5 and R2 signalling telephone systems, which occasionally incorrectly interpreted user data (from a &quot;blue box&quot;) as commands.
* output &quot;user data&quot; may not always be the same as input user data. For example, many early email systems were not 8-bit clean; they seemed to transfer typical short text messages properly, but converted &quot;unusual&quot; characters (the control characters, the &quot;high ASCII&quot; characters) in an irreversible way into some other &quot;usual&quot; character. Many of these systems also changed user data in other irreversible ways – such as inserting linefeeds to make sure each line is less than some maximum length, and inserting a &quot;&gt;&quot; at the beginning of every line that begins with &quot;From &quot;. Until 8BITMIME, a variety of binary-to-text encoding techniques have been overlaid on top of such systems to restore transparency – to make sure that any possible file can be transferred so that the final output &quot;user data&quot; is actually identical to the original user data.

<doc id="351091" wikidata="Q1936217" url="?curid=351091" title="Transparency (human–computer interaction)">
<text>Any change in a computing system, such as a new feature or new component, is transparent if the system after change adheres to previous external interface as much as possible while changing its internal behavior. The purpose is to shield change from all systems (or human users) on the other end of the interface. Confusingly, the term refers to the overall &quot;invisibility&quot; of the component, it does not refer to &quot;visibility of component&#x27;s internals&quot; (as in white box or open system). The term &quot;transparent&quot; is widely used in computing marketing in substitution of the term &quot;invisible&quot;, since the term &quot;invisible&quot; has a bad connotation (usually seen as something that the user can&#x27;t see, and has no control over) while the term &quot;transparent&quot; has a good connotation (usually associated with not hiding anything). The vast majority of the times, the term &quot;transparent&quot; is used in a misleading way to refer to the actual invisibility of a computing process, which is also described by the term &quot;opaque&quot;, especially with regards to data structures. Because of this misleading and counter-intuitive definition, modern computer literature tends to prefer use of &quot;&quot; over &quot;transparent&quot;.

The term is used particularly often with regard to an abstraction layer that is invisible either from its upper or lower neighboring layer.

Also temporarily used later around 1969, in IBM and Honeywell programming manuals, the term referred to a certain computer programming technique. An application code was transparent when it was clear of the low-level detail (such as device-specific management) and contained only the logic solving a main problem. It was achieved through encapsulation – putting the code into modules that hid internal details, making them invisible for the main application.

== Examples ==
For example, the Network File System is transparent, because it introduces the access to files stored remotely on the network in a way uniform with previous local access to a file system, so the user might even not notice it while using the folder hierarchy. The early File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is considerably less transparent, because it requires each user to learn how to access files through an &quot;ftp&quot; client.

Similarly, some file systems allow transparent compression and decompression of data, enabling users to store more files on a medium without any special knowledge; some file systems encrypt files transparently. This approach does not require running a compression or encryption utility manually.

In software engineering, it is also considered good practice to develop or use abstraction layers for database access, so that the same application will work with different databases; here, the abstraction layer allows other parts of the program to access the database transparently (see Data Access Object, for example).

In object-oriented programming, transparency is facilitated through the use of interfaces that hide actual implementations done with different underlying classes.

== Types of transparency in distributed system ==

Transparency means that any form of distributed system should hide its distributed nature from its users, appearing and functioning as a normal centralized system.

There are many types of transparency:
* Access transparency – Regardless of how resource access and representation has to be performed on each individual computing entity, the users of a distributed system should always access resources in a single, uniform way. Example: SQL Queries
* Location transparency – Users of a distributed system should not have to be aware of where a resource is physically located. Example: Pages in the Web
* Migration transparency – Users should not be aware of whether a resource or computing entity possesses the ability to move to a different physical or logical location.
* Relocation transparency – Should a resource move while in use, this should not be noticeable to the end user.
* Replication transparency – If a resource is replicated among several locations, it should appear to the user as a single resource.
* Concurrent transparency – While multiple users may compete for and share a single resource, this should not be apparent to any of them.
* Failure transparency – Always try to hide any failure and recovery of computing entities and resources.
* Persistence transparency – Whether a resource lies in volatile or permanent memory should make no difference to the user.
* Security transparency – Negotiation of cryptographically secure access of resources must require a minimum of user intervention, or users will circumvent the security in preference of productivity.

Formal definitions of most of these concepts can be found in RM-ODP, the Open Distributed Processing Reference Model (ISO 10746).

The degree to which these properties can or should be achieved may vary widely. Not every system can or should hide everything from its users. For instance, due to the existence of a fixed and finite speed of light there will always be more latency on accessing resources distant from the user. If one expects real-time interaction with the distributed system, this may be very noticeable.

<doc id="351094" wikidata="Q347986" url="?curid=351094" title="Steve Jones (musician)">
<text>Stephen Philip Jones (born 3 September 1955) is an English guitarist, best known as a member of the punk band Sex Pistols. Following the split of the Sex Pistols, he formed the Professionals with former bandmate Paul Cook. He has released two solo albums, and worked with Johnny Thunders, Iggy Pop, Cheap Trick, Bob Dylan and Thin Lizzy. In 1995, he formed the short-lived supergroup Neurotic Outsiders with members of Guns N&#x27; Roses and Duran Duran. He played with Suicidal Tendencies frontman Mike Muir&#x27;s Cyco Miko, which is still an ongoing project. Jones was ranked No. 97 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2015 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

==Early life==
Jones was born in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London, where he grew up with his young mother, who worked as a hairdresser, and his grandparents. He first moved to Benbow Road in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and then to Nine Elms in Battersea. Jones befriended future bandmate Paul Cook in his childhood. He was an only child and his father, Don Jarvis, a professional boxer, left when he was two years old. He revealed in his 2016 autobiography &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; that he was sexually abused by his stepfather, Ron Dambagella, which he blamed for his later sex addiction and inability to form lasting relationships. 

He was a student at the Christopher Wren School, now Phoenix High School, London in White City Estate, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, though he rarely attended. He revealed that he was functionally illiterate until he was in his 40s. With 14 criminal convictions, he was the subject of a council-care order and spent a year in a remand centre, which he said was more enjoyable than being at home. Jones has said that the Sex Pistols saved him from a life of crime.

==Career==
===1970s===
Jones co-founded The Strand (named after a Roxy Music song) with Paul Cook and Wally Nightingale in the early 1970s but later changed its name to The Swankers. After the band dropped Nightingale in August 1975 they reformed as the Sex Pistols with Jones, Cook, Glen Matlock, and John Lydon. Jones was the oldest member of the band.

In October 1976, Jones was filmed as an extra in the movie &quot;The Squeeze&quot;, released in 1977.

Jones is a self-taught guitar player, primarily playing Gibson Les Paul electric guitars in his early years. He had allegedly only been playing for three months before his first Sex Pistols gig, and has said that practising under the influence of black beauties helped him focus well on learning the instrument.

His usual guitar was a cream-coloured Gibson Les Paul Custom which Malcolm McLaren had acquired from Sylvain Sylvain of The New York Dolls. According to the Sex Pistols documentary &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot;, he had stolen equipment from a truck parked behind the Hammersmith Odeon where David Bowie was playing the Ziggy Farewell concerts, when he and some of his friends posed as road-crew members, stealing amplifiers and other equipment.

Bill Price, the engineer on &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;, called Jones one of the tightest guitar players he has ever worked with; this is due to his &quot;chuggy&quot; playing in the studio as Price described it as having very little sustain and echo, which required overdubs to hide.

Due to bassist Sid Vicious&#x27;s musical incompetence, Jones played the primary bass-guitar parts for &quot;Bodies&quot; and &quot;Holidays in the Sun&quot; on &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; (a part played by Vicious is buried in the mix on &quot;Bodies&quot; and Matlock appears on the other songs as they had previously been recorded as singles and B-sides).

When the Sex Pistols were interviewed by Bill Grundy on the Thames Television&#x27;s local news &quot;Today&quot; programme on 1 December 1976, Jones swore at Grundy after being goaded to do so, catalyzing the notoriety of the band.
After the Sex Pistols broke up in 1978, Jones and drummer Paul Cook co-founded the Professionals. They released four singles, recorded a self-titled LP that was shelved until 1990, and released &quot;I Didn&#x27;t See It Coming&quot; in November 1981. The band&#x27;s American tour to promote the album was cut short when band members Paul Cook, Paul Myers, and Ray McVeigh were injured in a car accident. While the Professionals did return to America in the spring of 1982 after recovery, Jones&#x27;s and Myers&#x27;s drug problems further hampered the band&#x27;s prospects. They declined an opening spot offer on tour for The Clash, and broke up.

===1980s===
Jones was a member of Chequered Past (led by Michael Des Barres) from 1982 to 1985. They released a self-titled album in 1984. Jones performed alongside Sex Pistols bandmate Paul Cook on Johnny Thunders&#x27; solo album &quot;So Alone&quot;. Siouxsie and the Banshees thought for a while to engage Jones after the departure of two of their original members. Rehearsals took place in early 1980, and Jones recorded the guitars parts on three songs of the album &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;. The experience did not go further than a simple recording session.

Jones played with Thin Lizzy, Billy Idol, Joan Jett, Kraut, Adam Ant, Bob Dylan, Iggy Pop, Andy Taylor, the Dano Jones Band, Megadeth, Neurotic Outsiders, and had a solo career in the 1980s and early 1990s. His song &quot;Mercy&quot;, from the album of the same name, was used in a &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode called &quot;Stone&#x27;s War&quot; and was featured on the &quot;Miami Vice II&quot; soundtrack album and in the film &quot;Homeboy&quot; 1988. &quot;Pleasure and Pain&quot;, also from the album &quot;Mercy&quot;, was included in the 1986 film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;, a biopic of Jones&#x27;s Sex Pistols bandmate Sid Vicious. In 1989, he released his second solo album, titled &quot;Fire and Gasoline&quot;, which featured Jones on guitar and vocals, Terry Nails on bass, and drummer Mickey Curry. Jones was a guest star in an episode of the television sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot;. He had previously played a private detective in &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;, and had a role in the 1981 film, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains&quot;.

===1990s===
In 1991 a project called Fantasy 7 (known as F7) was recorded, and remains officially unreleased. They toured locally in Los Angeles and a few shows in South America featuring singer Mark McCoy. In 1995, Jones played guitar on the self-titled and only album released by the band P, who featured Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers and actor Johnny Depp.

In 1996, Jones formed Neurotic Outsiders, that featured himself on guitar and vocals, former Guns N&#x27; Roses members Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum on rhythm guitar and drums, and John Taylor from Duran Duran, on bass. They released a self-titled album in 1996. &quot;I call him Uncle Steve&quot;, remarked Amanda Rootes of Fluffy, who supported the Outsiders on tour. &quot;I&#x27;ve got uncles just like him, East End gangster types.&quot; Also in 1996, he played guitar on most of the tracks for Cyco Miko&#x27;s Lost My Brain! (Once Again).

He played with Andy Taylor, guitarist of Duran Duran, by touring with the Power Station in the 1990s. Also in 1996, recorded guitar tracks for &quot;The Great Milenko&quot;, an album by Insane Clown Posse. Jones produced the self-titled debut albums of the Los Angeles-based Buckcherry and American Pearl, released in 1999 and 2000.

===2000s===
He participated in the Sex Pistols reunion concerts and currently resides in Los Angeles. He has since engaged in session work, playing guitar on Lisa Marie Presley&#x27;s 2005 album, &quot;Now What&quot;. Jones played lead guitar on two tracks. &quot;Here Today, Gone Tomorrow&quot; which was originally recorded for the Ramones tribute album &quot;We&#x27;re a Happy Family&quot; but only appeared as a hidden track on &quot;Now What&quot;.

The Sex Pistols, including Jones, played a gig for the 30th anniversary of &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; at the Brixton Academy on 8 November 2007. Due to popular demand, four further gigs were added for the subsequent days, making five in total. A further gig in Brixton on 12 November was followed by one at the MEN Arena in Manchester on 17 November. The Glasgow S.E.C.C on 18 November completed the tour. In 2008, he played guitar on four songs on the David Byrne &amp; Brian Eno collaboration, &quot;Everything That Happens Will Happen Today&quot;.

Jones has recently played with Hollywood United F.C., an American amateur soccer team based in Los Angeles, made up mainly of celebrities and former professional footballers. In 2008, the Sex Pistols appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival as the headlining act on the Saturday night, the Peace &amp; Love festival in Sweden, and the Live at Loch Lomond festival in Scotland.

===2010s===
Jones made a cameo appearance on &quot;Portlandia&quot;&#x27;s second-season finale, &quot;Brunch Village&quot;, which aired on 9 March 2012. In May 2012, Jones appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; in a sketch playing himself as the roommate to Prince Charles (played by Craig Ferguson), as well as playing guitar on a cover of Ninian Hawick&#x27;s &quot;Scottish Rite Temple Stomp&quot; in a cold open to a week of shows shot in Scotland. He later appeared on Ferguson&#x27;s last show in December 2014, playing guitar during a rendition of Dead Man Fall&#x27;s &quot;Bang Your Drum.&quot;

Jones was ranked 97th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. After an appearance as the guest on Russell Brand&#x27;s FX television program &quot;Brand X with Russell Brand&quot; in 2013, Jones assumed the duties of the house band on that program. He performed solo on the electric guitar. In 2013 and 2014, Jones appeared as recurring character &quot;Krull&quot; during the sixth and seventh seasons of Showtime television series &quot;Californication&quot;, playing the road manager of Tim Minchin&#x27;s character Atticus Fetch.

==Equipment==
While with the Sex Pistols, Jones mostly played two Gibson Les Paul Customs, a black 1954 Gibson Les Paul Custom and his most famous white 1974 Gibson Les Paul Custom (with the pin-up girls on it) that formerly belonged to Sylvain Sylvain of the New York Dolls. In the late &#x27;90s, Jones was offered free Burny Les Paul Customs, straps, picks and cables if he played their guitar. They made two models for him which he used on the 2002–2003 North American Piss Off Tour. At around 2005 he went back to using Gibsons, but has still been seen playing his Burny. In 2008, Gibson put out a &quot;Steve Jones Signature Les Paul Model&quot; to the exact specs of his original white 1974 Les Paul Custom.

While Jones typically, since the 1980s, plays through Marshall JCM 800 Stacks, he used a silverface Fender Twin Reverb (reportedly stolen from Bob Marley at the Hammersmith Apollo) with Gauss speakers to record &quot;Never Mind The Bollocks&quot;. He also used Musicman Amps and a Fender Super Reverb during the 1978 US Tour.

Jones also plays Hamer Sunburst double-cut guitars, and prefers the White Les Paul Custom as his primary guitar.

==&quot;Jonesy&#x27;s Jukebox&quot;==
In February 2004, Jones began hosting a daily radio program in Los Angeles, called &quot;Jonesy&#x27;s Jukebox&quot;, on Indie 103.1 FM, where he could do whatever he wanted (within FCC rules), with no direction from station management. Jones mixed an eclectic playlist with rambling and often humorous interviews of guests from the entertainment industry. He kept an acoustic guitar in the studio and frequently performed stream of consciousness songs about the current topic of discussion. Notable guests included Eddie Vedder, Chrissie Hynde, Johnny Ramone, Billy Corgan, Susanna Hoffs, Leif Garrett, Brian Wilson, Pete Townshend, Iggy Pop, Josh Homme, Robert Plant, Gary Oldman, Corey Taylor and Johnny Rotten.

Indie 103.1&#x27;s last broadcast of &quot;Jonesy&#x27;s Jukebox&quot; was on 14 January 2009. Indie 103.1 ceased to exist as a broadcast-radio station on 15 January 2009. In November 2009, he guested on BBC Radio&#x27;s 6Music with five Sunday shows, titled &quot;A Month of Sundays with Steve Jones&quot;, playing a mix of tunes from his childhood through to the current day. In December 2009, the show was revived and ran via internet radio on IAmRogue.com , a website run by producer Ryan Kavanaugh. This incarnation of the show ended in late March 2010. Jones was picked up by LA radio Station, KROQ, in October 2010 to continue his &quot;Jonesy&#x27;s Jukebox&quot; segment. Jones&#x27;s last show on KROQ was March 2013.

Jonesy&#x27;s Jukebox returned to the radio in late 2015 on 95.5 KLOS in Los Angeles. Starting 1 January 2016, the show expanded to five days a week, Monday to Friday. KLOS is a mainstream classic rock station featuring bands like Van Halen, Aerosmith and Pink Floyd. Guests on the show often reflect the KLOS format and have included Paul Cook, Lars Ulrich, Dave Mustaine, Simple Minds, Paul Stanley, Dave Vanian, Captain Sensible, Danny Trejo, Puddles Pity Party, Ozzy Osbourne, Slash, Gary Oldman, Johnny Depp, Lenny Kravitz, Judas Priest, Yes, Juliette Lewis, Bill Burr, Mike Tramp, The Zombies, Brian May, Jack Black, David Coverdale, Rob Schneider, Stewart Copeland, Rick Springfield, Retta, John Cooper Clarke, Seymour Stein, Dave Davies, Micky Dolenz, Duff McKagan, Corey Taylor, Linda Ramone, Fred Armisen, Billy Idol, Chris Jericho, Liz Carey, Carmine Appice, Gary Numan, Josh Homme, Adam Sandler, Ace Frehley, Dave Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Jerry Cantrell, Kim Thayil, Mike McCready and Anthony Kiedis. Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy are frequent recurring guests. Beginning late 2019, due to Jones&#x27; health, following a heart attack, the show was cut back to once a week.

In 2018 Steve Jones received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame due to his work as a radio disc jockey. 

==Personal life==
Around 1990 Jones was able to quit drugs and alcohol with the help of a 12-step program. Jones is a vegetarian. In 2019, Jones had surgery following a heart attack. He has never married, and resides in Southern California, where he has worked as a disc jockey on several local radio stations. Jones is a supporter of Chelsea F.C., having supported the club since his childhood.

<doc id="351097" wikidata="Q1292186" url="?curid=351097" title="West Midlands conurbation">
<text>The West Midlands conurbation is the large conurbation in the West Midlands region of England. The area consists of two cities and numerous towns: to the east, the city of Birmingham, along with adjacent towns of Solihull and Sutton Coldfield; and to the west, the city of Wolverhampton and the area called the Black Country, containing the towns of Dudley, Walsall, West Bromwich, Oldbury, Willenhall, Bilston, Darlaston, Tipton, Smethwick, Wednesbury, Rowley Regis, Stourbridge and Halesowen. 

It is broken down into multiple Travel to Work Areas: &quot;Birmingham&quot;, &quot;Wolverhampton&quot;, &quot;Dudley &amp; Sandwell&quot;, &quot;Walsall &amp; Cannock&quot;, Hagley is within the &quot;Kidderminster&quot; area and the extreme south-east corner is within the &quot;Warwick &amp; Stratford upon Avon&quot; area. The conurbation is mainly in the West Midlands county, including parts of the surrounding counties of Staffordshire (e.g. Little Aston, Perton and Essington) and Worcestershire (such as Hagley and Hollywood), with Coventry a separate area in the county.

According to the 2011 Census the area had a population of 2,440,986, making it the third most populated in the United Kingdom behind Greater London and Greater Manchester.

With the West Midlands also being a region and county, the conurbation is sometimes known as Birmingham-Wolverhampton. though it is the term Birmingham &amp; The Black Country that has gained the widest traction as an alternative to the conurbation&#x27;s official name: an example of this is the tagline used by BBC Radio WM - &quot;The sound of Birmingham &amp; The Black Country&quot;.

==Constituent parts==

Although the exact boundaries of any conurbation are open to debate, dependent on what criteria are used to determine where an urban area ceases, the Office for National Statistics defines the West Midlands Built Up Area as including the urban areas of Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Solihull, West Bromwich, Dudley, and Walsall amongst others. These settlements are not coterminous with the Metropolitan Boroughs of the same name.

Coventry is separated from the West Midlands conurbation by the Meriden Gap, and other urban areas, such as Cannock and Codsall remain separate from the conurbation. Coventry is 19 miles east of Birmingham.


==Administration==
Occasionally the conurbation is seen as being coterminous with the West Midlands Metropolitan county; however, this includes Coventry, which is separate from the main urban area, and excludes the parts of the surrounding counties of Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire that fall within the conurbation.

For administrative purposes, the vast majority of the conurbation falls within the six Metropolitan Boroughs of Birmingham, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton.

Two Local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) cover the majority of the conurbation area: Black Country LEP comprises the local authorities of Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton while the Greater Birmingham &amp; Solihull LEP includes those two authorities and a number of satellite boroughs, many remote from the conurbation and not traditionally associated with it (Bromsgrove, Cannock Chase, East Staffordshire, Lichfield, Redditch, Tamworth and Wyre Forest).

==Settlements==

===2011 Census===
The West Midlands Built Up Area consists of the below subdivisions. Due to the change in methodology between the 2001 and 2011 Census, and the amount of change between 2011 Census and previous census data, it is impossible to compare the data directly between 2011 and earlier Censuses. 
In the 2011 Census, Coleshill and Water Orton are two separate built-up areas with populations of 6,341 and 3,444 respectively. Prior to 2011, they were considered part of the West Midlands Urban Area.

=== Prior censuses ===
Prior to the 2011 census, the conurbation was known by the ONS as the West Midlands Urban Area, which contained the following Urban Sub-Divisions:

<doc id="351114" wikidata="Q977991" url="?curid=351114" title="Skegness">
<text>Skegness ( ) is a seaside town and civil parish in the East Lindsey District of Lincolnshire, England. On the Lincolnshire coast of the North Sea, the town is east of Lincoln and north-east of Boston. With a population of 21,128 as of 2021, it is the largest settlement in East Lindsey. It incorporates Winthorpe and Seacroft, and forms a larger built-up area with the resorts of Ingoldmells and Chapel St Leonards to the north. The town is on the A52 and A158 roads, connecting it with Boston and the East Midlands, and Lincoln respectively. Skegness railway station is on the Nottingham to Skegness (via Grantham) line.

The original Skegness was situated farther east at the mouth of The Wash. Its Norse name refers to a headland which sat near the settlement. By the 14th century, it was a locally important port for coastal trade. The natural sea defences which protected the harbour eroded in the later Middle Ages, and it was lost to the sea after a storm in the 1520s. Rebuilt along the new shoreline, early modern Skegness was a small fishing and farming village, but from the late 18th century members of the local gentry visited for holidays. The arrival of the railways in 1873 transformed it into a popular seaside resort. This was the intention of The 9th Earl of Scarbrough, who owned most of the land in the vicinity; he built the infrastructure of the town and laid out plots, which he leased to speculative developers. This new Skegness quickly became a popular destination for holiday-makers and day trippers from the East Midlands factory towns. By the interwar years the town was established as one of the most popular seaside resorts in Britain. The layout of the modern seafront dates to this time and holiday camps were built around the town, including the first Butlin&#x27;s holiday resort which opened in Ingoldmells in 1936.

The package holiday abroad became an increasingly popular and affordable option for many British holiday-makers during the 1970s; this trend combined with declining industrial employment in the East Midlands to harm Skegness&#x27;s visitor economy in the late 20th century. Nevertheless, the resort retains a loyal visitor base. Tourism increased following the recession of 2007–09 owing to the resort&#x27;s affordability. In 2011, the town was England&#x27;s fourth most popular holiday destination for UK residents, and in 2015 it received over 1.4 million visitors. It has a reputation as a traditional English seaside resort owing to its long, sandy beach and seafront attractions which include amusement arcades, eateries, Botton&#x27;s fairground, the pier, nightclubs and bars. Other visitor attractions include Natureland Seal Sanctuary, a museum, an aquarium, a heritage railway, an annual carnival, a yearly arts festival, and Gibraltar Point nature reserve to the south of the town.

Despite the arrival of several manufacturing firms since the 1950s and Skegness&#x27;s prominence as a local commercial centre, the tourism industry remains very important for the economy and employment but the tourism service economy&#x27;s low wages and seasonal nature, along with the town&#x27;s aging population, have contributed towards high levels of relative deprivation. Poor transport and communication links are barriers to economic diversification. Residents are served by five state primary schools and a preparatory school, two state secondary schools (one of which is selective), several colleges, a community hospital, several churches and two local newspapers. The town has a police station, a magistrates&#x27; court and a lifeboat station.

== Geography ==
=== Topography and geology ===

The civil parish of Skegness includes most of the linear settlement of Seacroft to the south and the village of Winthorpe and the suburban area of Seathorne to the north, all of which have been absorbed into the town&#x27;s urban area. The neighbouring parishes are: Ingoldmells to the north, Addlethorpe to the north-west, Burgh le Marsh to the west and Croft to the south. The town is approximately north-east of Boston and east of Lincoln.

Skegness fronts the North Sea. It is located on a low-lying flat region called Lincoln Marsh, which runs along the coast between Skegness and the Humber and separates the coast from the upland Wolds. Much of the parish&#x27;s elevation is close to sea level, although a narrow band along the seafront is above peaking at on North Parade; the A52 road is elevated at ; there is a short narrow bank parallel to the shoreline between the North Shore Golf Club and Seathorne which is above sea level.

The bedrock under the town is part of the Ferriby Chalk Formation, a sedimentary layer formed around 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous; it runs north-west from Skegness in a narrow band to Fotherby and Utterby north of Louth in the Wolds. The surface layers are tidal-flat deposits of clay and silt, deposited since the end of the last ice age. The shoreline consists of blown sand and beach deposits in the form of clay, silt and sand.

=== Coastal erosion ===
There has been coastal erosion in the area for thousands of years, though it was relatively sheltered until the Middle Ages by a series of offshore barrier islands or shoals of boulder clay. Rising sea levels and more intense sea storms from the 13th century onward likely eroded these islands, increasingly exposing the coast to the tides. Records from the Middle Ages show that local people maintained sand banks as a form of sea defence; fines were levied for grazing animals on the dunes, which could weaken the defences. Skegness was flooded in 1525 or 1526, requiring the village to be rebuilt inland, and loss of land continued during the century. A clay embankment, Roman Bank, was built in the late 16th century and was followed in &quot;c&quot;. 1670 by another closer to the sea (Green Bank), running from what is now North Shore Road to Cow Bank, following a line from St Andrew&#x27;s Drive to Drummond Road. By the late 19th century, sands were accreting at Skegness; the retaining sea wall erected in 1878 was designed to support the resort town&#x27;s seafront development rather than to protect it from the sea. Nevertheless, this wall largely saved the town during the 1953 flood, when only gardens, the amusements and part of the pier were damaged.

In the early 21st century, Longshore drift carries particles of sediment southwards along the Lincolnshire coast. At Skegness, the sand settles out in banks which run at a slight south-west angle to the coast. Sand continues to accrete at the southern end of the town&#x27;s shore, but coastal erosion continues immediately north of the settlement. Modern sea defences have been built along a stretch of coast between Mablethorpe (to the north) and Skegness to prevent erosion, but currents remove sediment and the defences hinder dune development; a nourishment scheme began operation in 1994 to replace lost sand.

=== Climate ===
The British Isles experience a temperate, maritime climate with warm summers and cool winters. Lincolnshire&#x27;s position on the east of the British Isles allows for a sunnier and warmer climate relative to the national average, and it is one of the driest counties in the UK. In Skegness, the average daily high temperature peaks in August at and a peak average daily mean of occurs in July and August. The lowest daily mean temperature is in January; the average daily high for that month is and the daily low is .


== History ==
=== Prehistoric and medieval ===
There is evidence of late Iron-Age and early Roman saltmaking activity in the Skegness area. Place names and a report of a castle in the medieval settlement have been interpreted as evidence that a Roman fort existed in the town before being lost to the sea in the late Middle Ages. The archaeologist Charles Phillips suggested that Skegness was the terminus of a Roman road running from Lincoln through Burgh le Marsh and the location of a Roman ferry which crossed The Wash to Norfolk. If the Roman fortifications indeed existed, it is likely that the Anglo-Saxons used them as a coastal shore fort. Later, the Vikings settled in Lincolnshire; their influence is detected in many local place names. Skegness&#x27;s name combines the Old Norse words &quot;Skeggi&quot; and &quot;ness&quot;, and means either &quot;Skeggi&#x27;s headland&quot; or &quot;beard-shaped headland&quot;; Skeggi (meaning &quot;bearded one&quot;) may be the name of a Viking settler or it could derive from the Old Norse word &quot;&quot; &quot;beard&quot; and have been used to describe the shape of the landform. Skegness was not named in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086. It is usually identified with the &quot;Domesday&quot; settlement called Tric. The historian Arthur Owen and the linguist Richard Coates have argued that Tric derived its name from &quot;Traiectus&quot;, Latin for &quot;crossing&quot;, referring to the Roman ferry that Phillips argues launched from Skegness. The name Skegness appears in the 12th century, and further references are known from the 13th.

Natural sea defences (including a promontory or cape, as the place name suggests, and barrier shoals and dunes) protected a harbour at Skegness in the Middle Ages. It was relatively small and its trade in the 14th century was predominantly coastal; its economic fortunes were probably closely related to those of nearby coastal ports, such as Wainfleet, which in turn depended on the larger port at Boston which was heavily involved in the wool trade. It was also an important fishing port. During the medieval period the offshore barrier islands which sheltered the coast were destroyed, very likely in the 13th century during a period of exceptionally stormy weather. This left the coast exposed to the sea; later in the Middle Ages, frequent storms and floods eroded sea defences. Between the 14th and 16th centuries, Skegness was one of several coastal settlements to incur major loss of land. Local people attempted to make artificial banks, but they were costly. Rising sea levels further threatened the coast and in 1525 or 1526 Skegness was largely washed away in a storm, along with the hamlets of East and West Meales.

=== Later fishing and farming village ===
Skegness was rebuilt along the new coastline. By 1543, when the antiquarian John Leland visited the town, he noted that &quot;For old Skegnes is now buildid a pore new thing&quot;; the settlement was principally a small farming and fishing village throughout the early modern period, with the marshland providing good summer pasture for sheep. Over the course of the 16th century, the sea continued to encroach into the land at Skegness, while depositing sand banks further south, leading to the creation of Gibraltar Point. Roman Bank, a clay sea defence upon which the A52 road now runs through Skegness, was built in the latter part of the century. Much of the land in and around Skegness came into the hands of Nicholas Saunderson, 1st Viscount Castleton, who enclosed of saltmarsh in 1627 and later in the 17th century reclaimed more marshland which had emerged from the sea, sheltered behind the growing Gibraltar Point. His descendant was responsible for erecting Green Bank between Roman Bank and the shore in &quot;c&quot;. 1670, allowing more lands to be converted to agriculture. The Lords Castleton enclosed a large portion of the land around Skegness by 1740, over . The Castleton estate passed through the male line which became extinct in 1723 on the death of the 5th Viscount, who bequeathed his estate to his cousin Thomas Lumley; in 1739 Lumley became 3rd Earl of Scarbrough. By 1845, the Scarbrough estate comprised at Skegness. Although the population rose above 300 by 1851, the settlement &quot;was still very much an undeveloped village of fishermen, farmers and farm hands&quot; in the early 1870s.

=== Early resort ===
Local gentry began visiting the village for leisure from the late 18th century. The sea air was thought to have health-giving qualities. To capitalise on this trend, the Skegness Hotel opened in 1770; visitors could reach it by omnibus from Boston, which was the terminus of several stagecoaches. The first reference to bathing machines on Skegness&#x27;s shores dates to 1784 though they are thought to have been present earlier. Private houses also opened their doors to lodgers, and other hotels opened. Born and raised at Somersby, the poet Alfred Tennyson holidayed at Skegness as a young man; some scholars have drawn parallels between his poetry and the landscape he encountered on these visits.

=== Railways and the modern resort ===

The East Lincolnshire Railway, running along the coast between Boston and Grimsby, opened in 1848. In 1871, a branch line was built to Wainfleet All Saints with rolling stock operated by the Great Northern Railway; an extension to Skegness was approved by shareholders that year and the railways arrived at Skegness in 1873. The line was designed to bring day trippers to the seaside. Rising wages and better holiday provision meant that some working-class people from the East Midlands factory towns could afford to have a holiday for the first time. With agriculture in depression, the major landowner Richard Lumley, 9th Earl of Scarbrough had seen his local rental income decline; his agent, H. V. Tippet, decided that the earl&#x27;s fortunes might be revived if he turned Skegness into a seaside resort. A road plan was developed and the earl took out a mortgage of £120,000 to fund developments. In 1878, the full plan laid out plots for 787 houses in a grid-aligned settlement on of land between the shoreline and Roman Bank north of the High Street. Scarbrough Avenue would run inland from the centre of the Parade and was bisected by Lumley Avenue, with a new church in the roundabout. At the end of Scarbrough Avenue would be a pier.

 The earl spent thousands of pounds on laying roads and the sewerage system, and building the sea wall (finished in 1878). He provided or invested in other amenities, including the gas and water supply, Skegness Pier (opened in 1881), the pleasure gardens (finished in 1881), the steamboats (launched by 1883) and bathing pools (1883). He donated land and money towards the building of St Matthew&#x27;s Church, two Methodist chapels, a school and the cricket ground. Housebuilding was left to speculative builders; the earliest development was concentrated along Lumley Road, which offered a direct route from the train station to the seafront. Newspapers across the Midlands advertised properties, and shops began opening. By 1881 almost a thousand people had moved into the town. According to the local historian Winston Kime, Skegness had become known as a &quot;trippers&#x27; paradise&quot; by 1880. The August bank holiday in 1882 saw 20,000 descend on the town to enjoy the beach and the sea, the many games and amusements that had popped up in the town, the pleasure boat trips that had just started launching from the pier, and the donkey rides. Building contracted after the 1883 season, although in 1888 the accreted sands in front of the sea wall south of the pier were converted into the Marine Gardens, a lawn with trees and hedges. The undeveloped lands north of Scarbrough Avenue were fenced in and planted with trees in a space called The Park. This stagnation coincided with a declining number of day-trippers, which fell from a peak of 230,277 in 1882 to 118,473 in 1885. The local historian Richard Gurnham could not find a clear explanation for this decline in contemporary reports, though one newspaper article from 1884 blamed &quot;the depression of trade&quot; in Nottingham for a fall in visitor numbers compared with the previous year.

=== 1890s to 1945: boom years ===

Fortunes changed during the 1890s; in the words of the historian Susan Barton, &quot;Skegness and other &#x27;lower&#x27; status resorts provided cheap amusements, beach entertainers, street traders and, by the end of the nineteenth century, spectacular entertainment for a mass market&quot;. Convalescent homes began opening in the town, the earliest being the Nottinghamshire Convalescent Home for Men (1891). Holiday homes or camps for the poor opened in 1891 and 1907. The town became an urban district in 1895. In 1908 the famous &quot;Jolly Fisherman&quot; poster was used by the GNR to advertise day trips from King&#x27;s Cross in London. By 1913 more than 750,000 people made excursions to the town. Aside from bathing and enjoying the sands, visitors to Skegness found entertainment in the pier, which had a concert hall, saloon and theatre. Other theatres and picture houses opened in the early 20th century. Britain&#x27;s first switchback railway had opened in the town in 1885 or 1887. A fairground operated on the central beach before the First World War and the Figure 8 roller coaster replaced the switchback in 1908. By 1911, the population had reached 3,775.

Seventy-one local servicemen who died in the First World War are commemorated on the town&#x27;s war memorial. Aside from a seaplane base briefly established by the town in 1914, the conflict brought little change to the town&#x27;s fabric. Its popularity as a tourist destination grew in the interwar years and boomed during the 1930s. The urban district council purchased the seafront in 1922 and its surveyor R. H. Jenkins oversaw the construction of Tower Esplanade (1923), the boating lake (1924, extended in 1932), the Fairy Dell paddling pool, and the Embassy Ballroom and an outdoor pool in 1928, and remodelled the foreshore north of the pier in 1931. Billy Butlin (who had been a stall holder on the beach since 1925) built permanent amusements south of the pier in 1929. In 1932 the first illuminations were turned on; the following year Butlin launched a carnival. Cinemas and casinos joined the theatres of the Edwardian period as popular attractions, while some of the apartments and houses by the seafront were converted into shops, cafés and arcades. In 1936, Butlin built his own all-in holiday camp in Ingoldmells, providing entertainment and facilities for guests. It was joined in 1939 by The Derbyshire Miners&#x27; Holiday Camp. This coincided with growth in the residential area, mostly speculative developments and some council housing; North Parade was built up with hotels in the 1930s and the Seathorne Estate was also laid out in 1925. By 1931, the town&#x27;s population had reached 9,122.

During the Second World War, the Royal Air Force billeted thousands of trainees in the town for its No. 11 Recruit Centre. The Butlin&#x27;s camp was occupied by the Royal Navy, who called it HMS &quot;Royal Arthur&quot; and used it for training seamen. Aerial bombing of the town began in 1940; there were fatalities on several occasions, the greatest being on 24 October 1941 when twelve residents were killed. Fifty-seven local servicemen died in the conflict and are named on the town&#x27;s war memorial.

=== Since the Second World War ===
Since the Second World War, self-catered holidays have become popular, prompting the growth of caravan parks and chalet accommodation. By 1981, 20 caravan sites were in operation and five years later there were over 100,000 holiday caravans and chalets in Skegness and Ingoldmells. Increasingly the lodgings in the town centre closed or were converted into flats or shops. The 1970s also witnessed the advent of the cheap package airline holiday abroad, which took visitors away from British seaside towns. The decline in coal mining in the East Midlands in the 1980s caused what the BBC described as a &quot;damaging dip in trade&quot;. Nevertheless, holiday-makers continued to visit the town and, in the 1980s and 1990s, people ventured to Skegness for their second holiday alongside trips abroad; it also proved popular among the elderly in the winter months. The resort&#x27;s popularity grew during the late 2000s Great Recession, as it offered a cheaper alternative to holidays abroad. Between 2006 and 2008, 870,000 people made overnight trips to Skegness; this figure had risen to 1,030,000 for 2010–12.

The fabric of the town centre has also changed. North and South Bracing were built in 1948–49. Butlin&#x27;s left the main amusement park and it was extensively refurbished by Botton Bros in 1966; the switchback on North Parade was demolished in 1970. Residential development has included council estates near St Clement&#x27;s Church and Winthorpe, and various private developments. The seafront was fully developed in the 1970s and the last of The Park built on in 1982. In 1971, the pier entrance was remodelled; seven years later, a large section was swept away in a storm. The Embassy Ballroom and the swimming baths were replaced in 1999 with the Embassy Theatre Complex, which includes a theatre, indoor swimming pool, leisure centre and car park. By 2001, European Union grants had provided millions of pounds towards regeneration schemes. Most of the seafront&#x27;s hotels, cinemas and theatres have been turned into amusement arcades, nightclubs, shops and bingo halls. What remained of Frederica Terrace, one of Skegness&#x27;s oldest buildings, had been converted into entertainment bars and arcades before it was destroyed in a fire in 2007.

== Economy ==
According to VisitEngland, in 2011 Skegness was the fourth most popular holiday destination in England among UK residents. In 2015, Skegness and Ingoldmells received 1,484,000 visitors, of which 649,000 were day visitors; this brought in £212.83 million in direct expenditure, with an estimated economic impact of £289.60 million. The town council has described local employment as &quot;heavily reliant&quot; on tourism. One estimate suggested that in 2015 2,846 jobs were supported directly by the visitor economy (accounting for around a third of the town&#x27;s employed residents), with tourism indirectly supporting nearly 900 more. Over half of these jobs were in accommodation and food and drink, with a further 18.1% in retail. Skegness&#x27;s visitor economy has been described by the district council as &quot;counter-cyclical&quot;; while continuing to serve a loyal client base, it provides a cheap alternative to holidays abroad and has therefore proven popular when the economy has been slower for the rest of the region. The seafront is a hub for the tourism industry, much of which is geared towards the provision of food (most famously fish and chips), amusement arcades and other attractions, including the Botton&#x27;s Pleasure Beach funfair. The pubs, bars and nightclubs, and neon-lit amusements have earned it the nickname &quot;Skegvegas&quot; (after Las Vegas).

Before the 1950s, the only major manufacturing interest in Skegness was Alfred Hayward&#x27;s rock factory which had opened in the 1920s. After the Second World War, some other light industry arrived, including Murphy Radio and the nylon makers Stiebels; in 1954 the bearings and packaging systems manufacturer Rose Brothers (Gainsborough) Ltd opened a factory on Church Road in a former laundry. The urban district council opened an industrial estate off Wainfleet Road in 1956 which Murphy and Stiebels moved to. Murphy&#x27;s successor left the town in the 1970s, but Stiebels and the ride manufacturer R. G. Mitchell were still operating on the estate in the late 1980s, while Rose-Forgrove (which had opened a larger factory in 1977) and Sanderson Forklifts had factories elsewhere in the town. The latter went into administration in 1990, and the Rose Bearings factory was sold to NMB-Minebea in 1992; they closed it in 2010. The ride manufacturer R. G. Mitchell was purchased in 2005 by Photo-Me International; operation resumed under the name Jolly Roger Amusement Rides, which continues to operate on the industrial estate as of 2020. According to Google Maps, in 2020 there were three other manufacturers operating on the industrial estate: Unique Car Mats (UK) Ltd (founded in 1989), Windale Furnishings Ltd (a caravan seating maker founded in 1993), and Parragon Rubber Company. A range of services have outlets on the estate, including a medical practice, two skilled trades, a solicitor, five vehicle repair garages, three other repair services and a mobile disco. There is also a recycling centre and driving test centre; 16 shops ranging from a cheesemonger to tyre dealers; 12 wholesalers in electrics, building materials, plumbing and hardware supply, and 11 other wholesalers in fields including clothing, restaurant equipment, meat and plastic sheeting. The district council have proposed extending the estate as of 2016. The council also opened the Aura Skegness Business Centre there in 2004.
Along with Louth, Skegness is &quot;one of the main shopping and commercial centres&quot; in East Lindsey, most likely due to it being the closest service hub for a large part of the surrounding rural area. Management Horizon Europe&#x27;s 2008 UK shopping index measured the presence of national suppliers; Skegness was the highest ranked shopping destination in the district. It also ranked highest in the 2013–14 Venuescore survey. The High Street and Lumley Road are key retail areas, along with the Hildreds Centre (a small shopping mall which opened in 1988), Skegness Retail Park (developed between 2000 and 2005), and the Quora Retail Park on Burgh Road which opened in 2017 and includes several supermarkets; other supermarkets operate elsewhere. Occupancy rates are relatively high: in 2015, 4% of ground-floor retail units were vacant, which is less than half the national average and down from 9% in 2009. Nevertheless, Skegness is relatively weak at offering higher value comparison goods, with Lincoln and Grimsby being key destinations for high-value shopping.

== Demography ==
=== Population change ===
The poll tax returns for 1377 recorded 140 people living in Skegness over the age of 14; in 1563 there were 14 households, and in the late 17th century there were ten families. The first census of the parish was conducted in 1801 and recorded a population of 134. It had risen above 300 by 1841 and reached 366 ten years later, before dropping back to 349 in 1871. Following the initial development of the seaside resort, the population rose rapidly, contracted in the 1880s and then rose sharply so that by 1921 the resident population was over 9,000. This figure reached 12,539 in 1951, and continued to rise at varying rates over the century. It had reached 18,910 in 2001 and 19,579 in the 2011 census. As designated by the Office for National Statistics, the Skegness built-up area incorporates the contiguous conurbation extending north through Ingoldmells to Chapel St Leonards; this had a population of 24,876 in 2011 which makes it the largest settlement in the East Lindsey district (followed by Louth) and represents about 18% of the district&#x27;s population.

=== Ethnicity and religion ===
According to the 2011 census, Skegness&#x27;s population was 97.6% White; 1% Asian or British Asian; 0.4% Black, African, Caribbean or Black British; and 0.9% mixed or multi-ethnic; and 0.1% other. The population is therefore less ethnically diverse than England as a whole. 94.2% of the town&#x27;s population were born in the United Kingdom, compared with 86.2% nationally; 3.5% were born in European Union countries other than the UK and Ireland, of which more than three quarters (2.7% of the total) were born in post-2001 accession states; for England, the figures were 3.7% and 2.0% respectively. 1.8% of the population was born outside the EU, whereas the total for England was 9.4%.

In the 2011 census, 68.2% of Skegness&#x27;s population said they were religious and 24.9% said they did not follow a religion, very similar to England as a whole (68.1% and 24.7% respectively). However, compared to England&#x27;s population, Christians were a higher proportion of the Skegness population (66.8%), and all other groups were present at a lower proportion than the national rates. There were 8 Sikhs in Skegness, making up a negligible proportion of the population compared with 0.8% nationally; Hindus composed 0.1% (compared with 1.5% in England), Muslims 0.5% against 5% nationally, Jewish people 0.1% compared with 0.5% for all of England, and Buddhists 0.2% of the town&#x27;s population, contrasting with 0.5% nationally.
=== Household composition, age, health and housing ===

In the 2011 census, 47.8% of the population were male and 52.2% female. Of the population over 16, 45.3% were married, compared to 46.6% in England; 28.8% were single (a smaller proportion than in England where it is 34.6%), 12.8% divorced (compared with 9% in England), 10.3% widowed (higher than the 6.9% for all of England), 2.6% separated and 0.2% in same-sex civil partnerships (2.7% and 0.2% respectively in England). In 2011, there were 9,003 households in Skegness civil parish. It has a slightly higher than average proportion of one-person households (35.9% compared with England&#x27;s figure of 30.2%); most other households consist of one family (58.1% of the total, compared with 61.8% in England). There are higher than average rates of one-person (16.8%) and one-family (10.8%) households aged over 65 (the figures for England are 12.4% and 8.1% respectively). In 2016, East Lindsey had Lincolnshire&#x27;s second-highest rate of conception among females aged 15 to 17 (28.7 per 1,000).

East Lindsey has a high proportion of elderly residents, driven partly by high in-migration and by the out-migration of younger residents; the local authority has described this as a &quot;demographic imbalance&quot;. A 2005 study by the town council reported that for every two people aged 16–24 who left the town, three people aged 60 or above moved in. The 2011 census showed Skegness&#x27;s population to be older than the national average; the mean age was 44.3 and the median 46 years, compared with 39.3 and 39 for England. 21% of the population was under 20, versus 24% of England&#x27;s, and 32.2% of Skegness&#x27;s population was aged over 60, compared with 22% of England&#x27;s population. This high proportion of elderly residents has increased the proportion of infirm people in the district. In 2011, 69.6% of the population were in good or very good health, compared to 81.4% in England, and 9.9% in very bad or bad health, against 5.4% for England. 28.6% of people (12.8% in 16–64 year-olds) also reported having their day-to-day activities limited, compared with 17.6% in England (8.2% in 16–64 year-olds).

As of 2011, Skegness has a lower proportion of people who own their homes with or without a mortgage (54.7%) than in England (63.3%), a greater proportion of people who privately rent (27.5% compared with 16.8%) and a slightly smaller proportion of social renters (15.7% compared with 17.7% nationally). The proportion of household spaces which are detached houses is higher than average (32.4% compared with 22.3%), as is the proportion which are apartments in a converted house (9.8% compared with 4.3%) and flats in a commercial building (2.2% compared with 1.1%). The proportion of terraced household spaces is much lower (8.9% against 24.5% nationally), while the proportion of purpose-built flats is also lower (14% versus 16.7%). 2.3% of household spaces are caravans or other mobile structures, compared with 0.4% nationally. Since the end the 20th century, a growing number of people have opted to live in static caravans for a large part of the year; a 2011 report estimated that 6,600 people (mostly older and from former factory cities in the Midlands) were living in such properties in Skegness.

=== Workforce and deprivation ===
In 2011, 60% of Skegness&#x27;s residents aged between 16 and 74 were economically active, compared with 69.9% for all of England. 51.7% were in employment, compared with 62.1% nationally. The proportion in full-time employment is comparatively low, at 27.7% (against 38.6% for England). The proportion of retirees is higher, at 21.7% compared with 13.7% for England. The proportion of long-term sick or disabled is 7.9%, nearly double England&#x27;s 4%; 2.3% of people were long-term unemployed, compared with 1.7% in all of England. The 2011 census revealed that the most common industry residents worked in were: wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles (21.2%), accommodation and food services (17.3%), and human health and social work (11.7%). The proportion of people employed in accommodation and food services was over three times the national figure (5.6%), while the proportion working in wholesale and retail trade and vehicle repair was also higher than in England as a whole (15.9%). Most other industries were under-represented comparatively, with both financial services (0.8% versus 4.4% nationally) and information and communication (0.6% against 4.1% nationally) especially so.

The tourism industry in Skegness is dominated by low-paid, low-skilled and seasonal work. Compared with the whole of England, the workforce has a relatively high proportion of people in elementary occupations (18.9%), sales and customer service occupations (12.1%), caring, leisure and other service occupations (12.2%), as well as skilled trades (12.9%), managers and directors (12.9%) and process plant and machine operatives (8.7%). There is a much lower proportion of people in professional, associate professional, technical, administrative and secretarial occupations than in England as a whole (combined 22.3% versus 41.7% of England&#x27;s population aged 16–74).

A lack of more varied, higher skilled and better paid work and further education opportunities leads many more skilled, ambitious or qualified young people to leave. There is a chronic difficulty in attracting professionals to the area, including teachers and doctors; this is partly due to the perceived remoteness of the area, seasonality and social exclusion. Skegess&#x27;s poor transport links with other towns and limited public transport have also been identified by consultants as a &quot;barrier&quot; to economic growth, diversification, investment and commutability. While the digital nature of the information technology sector could provide opportunities for growth, weak broadband has stymied this sector&#x27;s development in the town. Employers also find it difficult to attract higher skilled workers, including chefs; a report prepared for the town council cites a lack of &quot;work readiness&quot; among young people as a common problem facing employers. The proportion of residents aged 16 to 74 with no qualifications was 40.8%, much higher than the national figure (22.5%); the proportion of residents whose highest qualification is at Level 1, 2 or 3 (equivalent to GCSEs or A-Levels) is lower in each category than the national population; 10.7% of the population have a qualification at Level 4 (Certificate of Higher Education) or above, compared with 27.4% nationally.

In a 2013 ONS study of 57 English seaside resorts, Skegness and Ingoldmells (combined) was the most deprived seaside town; 61.5% of their statistical areas (LSOAs) were in the most deprived quintile nationally; only 7.7% fell in the least-deprived three quintiles. The government&#x27;s Indices of Multiple Deprivation (2019) place large parts of Skegness among the 10% most deprived parts of England; two of its neighbourhoods were ranked among the ten most deprived areas in Lincolnshire. There is limited research into the causes of deprivation in the town. A local official quoted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2013 attributed high levels of deprivation to the seasonal and low-paid nature of work in the tourism industry, which constitutes a large part of Skegness&#x27;s economy; and also the tendency for retirees (often in variable health) from former industrial areas in the East Midlands to move to the town and spend most of the year living there in caravans. In 2019, the town council listed several key challenges: the low-paid, low-skilled and seasonal nature of work in the tourism industry; a consequential dependency on benefits and a reduced tax base; the under-funding of public services; poor infrastructure; a lack of training for and consequent out-migration of talented young people; and difficulty attracting skilled workers.

== Transport ==
=== Railway ===
Skegness railway station is the eastern terminus for the Grantham to Skegness &quot;Poacher&quot; line. East Midlands Railway operates hourly services to/from via .

As of 2020, trains run the full length of the Poacher Line and the Nottingham to Grantham Line to provide connections throughout the East Midlands; Nottingham, Grantham, and have direct connections, while , and require a change at Nottingham.

Opened in 1873, it was the final station on the Firsby–Skegness branch of the East Lincolnshire Railway. The number of people travelling by car and coach probably overtook the number using the train in the 1930s, a trend solidified in the post-war years. The station was earmarked for closure in the Beeching cuts in the 1960s, but a third of the summer visitors still used it and lobbying by the urban district council preserved passenger services. The line was nevertheless closed to freight traffic in 1966 and the main interconnecting line, the East Lincolnshire Railway, was dismantled from Firsby to Grimsby in 1970. The passenger timetable was reduced to save costs in 1977, but a full timetable returned in 1989 and improvement works were carried out in 2001 and 2011; the latter saw the old station master&#x27;s house demolished. 

=== Road ===
The A52 road from Newcastle-under-Lyme to Mablethorpe passes through Skegness, via Nottingham, Grantham and Boston. The A158 from Lincoln terminates in the town. The A1028 connects Skegness with the A16, which runs from Grimsby to Peterborough via Louth.

=== Buses ===
Omnibus services reached the village from Boston before the development of the resort; by the 1840s, Brown&#x27;s omnibus made the journey from Boston three days a week. 

Stagecoach Lincolnshire is the main bus operator in the town, with regular services on routes to Ingoldmells and Chapel St Leonards; there are Lincolnshire InterConnect services up the coast as far as Mablethorpe and inland to Boston and Lincoln.

=== Air ===
Skegness Water Leisure Park, located to the north of the town, has its own light aircraft airfield named &quot;Skegness Airfield&quot; (ICAO: EGNI), operated by Skegness Aerofield Club. It is equipped with two runways and PPR (Prior Permission Required) is required for landing.

The main international airport serving Skegness is East Midlands Airport at Castle Donington, south of Nottingham and approximately from Skegness. Humberside Airport, near Immingham in North Lincolnshire, is approximately away, but operates a much smaller range of passenger services.

== Government and politics ==
=== Local government ===

Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lincolnshire since the Middle Ages, the ancient parish of Skegness was in the Marsh division of the ancient wapentake of Candleshoe in the Parts of Lindsey. In 1875, it was placed in the Spilsby Poor Law Union, but in 1885 Skegness became a local board of health and urban sanitary district. In 1894, Skegness Urban District was created in its place. The civil parish of Winthorpewhich had previously been part of the Spilsby union, rural sanitary district and, from 1894, rural districtwas abolished in 1926; most of it was merged into Skegness Urban District and a portion into Addlethorpe civil parish. In 1974, the urban district was merged with the municipal borough of Louth, the Alford, Horncastle, Mablethorpe and Sutton, and Woodhall Spa urban districts, and the rural districts of Horncastle, Louth and Spilsby to create East Lindsey, a district of Lincolnshire; by statutory instrument Skegness civil parish became the urban district&#x27;s successor.

Skegness Town Council, the parish-level government body beneath the district council, is composed of 21 councillors from four wards: Clock Tower (1 seat), St Clements (7 seats), Winthorpe (5 seats) and Woodlands (8 seats). There are seven representatives for Skegness on East Lindsey District Council, which uses different wards: three councillors are returned for Scarbrough and Seacroft ward, and two each from St Clements and Winthorpe wards. Skegness sends two councillors to Lincolnshire County Council, one each for Skegness North and Skegness South divisions.

Skegness Urban District Council meetings were held at 23 Algitha Road until 1920, when the authority purchased the Earl of Scarbrough&#x27;s estate office at Roman Bank for £3,000 and used those as offices; these burned down in 1928; a new town hall opened in 1931 and was later extended. In the 1950s, the council acquired for £50,000 the former convalescent home run by the National Deposit Friendly Society on North Parade (this had been built in 1927); this was converted into offices, which were opened in 1964. The town council took over the building and it continues as the town hall as of 2019.

=== National and European politics ===

In national politics, Skegness fell within the Lincolnshire parliamentary constituency until 1832; in 1818 four residents were entitled to vote, and in 1832 there were seven electors. That year the county was divided up and the village was included (with all of Lindsey) in North Lincolnshire. In 1867, it was transferred to the new Mid Lincolnshire constituency, which was abolished in 1885, after which Skegness was placed in the Horncastle constituency. Another reorganisation saw the parish incorporated into the East Lindsey seat in 1983; this was abolished in 1995 and Skegness was transferred into the new constituency of Boston and Skegness. The incumbent MP is Richard Tice of Reform UK, who has held the constituency since winning it from Matt Warman of the Conservative Party in the 2024 general election. The constituency was previously a Conservative Party stronghold and was held by Conservative members of parliament since it was created. Between 1999 and the United Kingdom&#x27;s departure from the European Union (EU) in 2020, Skegness was represented in the European Parliament by the East Midlands constituency.

At the first election after it was created (1997), the current seat was highly marginal, with the Conservatives receiving 42.4% of the vote and Labour 41.0%. By 2019 the Conservatives had increased their vote share to 76.7% (their second-highest nationally), while Labour&#x27;s share had fallen to 14.0%.

The same period saw support for the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) grow, reaching a peak in 2015, when it polled second and secured UKIP&#x27;s second-highest vote share in any constituency in that election. The constituency is estimated to have had the highest vote share in favour of leaving the EU in the 2016 EU referendum, at 75.6%. In the aftermath the town became the focus of international media attention, with Reuters labelling it &quot;Brexit-on-Sea&quot; and suggesting that many of its residents were &quot;more nostalgic and more socially conservative&quot; than those in diverse, liberal, urban areas, and keen to see state funds paid to the EU redirected into supporting the town. Afterwards support for UKIP fell and the party did not stand in 2019, although support for leaving the EU remained high. The Brexit Party did not contest the parliamentary seat in 2019, but in the European Parliament elections held earlier that year, it has been estimated that Boston and Skegness probably had the third-highest vote share for the Brexit Party of any constituency.

== Public services ==
=== Utilities and communications ===
As part of the Earl of Scarbrough&#x27;s scheme, gas works were opened in the town in 1877 and were lighting the streets the following year. The urban district council (UDC) declined to purchase the gas company in 1902; the UDC attempted to take it over in 1911, and (after much dispute with the company) purchased it in 1914. The works were extended in the 1920s. The UDC&#x27;s gas company was nationalised in 1949 and its functions taken over by the East Midlands Gas Board, which merged into British Gas Corporation in 1973 and was privatised in 1986.

The town&#x27;s water works opened in 1879 and were extended in the 1920s. To meet growing demand, Lord Scarbrough had a new borehole sunk at Welton le Marsh in 1904, with a pumping station and pipes which transported fresh water to the town; the water company was purchased by Skegness Urban District Council in 1909. The first sewerage disposal system was designed by D. Balfour as part of the Earl of Scarbrough&#x27;s development scheme; a sewerage farm and works were erected at Seacroft. The development was principally funded by the Earl, with a quarter of the funds contributed by the Spilsby Sanitary Authority. A sewerage disposal works opened at Burgh Le Marsh in 1936. Responsibility for water was later taken over by the East Lincolnshire Water Board; in 1973 this merged into the Anglian Water Authority, which was privatised as Anglian Water in 1989.

The Mid-Lincolnshire Electricity Supply Company brought electricity to the town in 1932. The company was nationalised in 1948 and its function taken over by the East Midlands Electricity Board. Street lighting was electrified in the late 1950s. Electricity supply was privatised in 1990.

Skegness&#x27;s first post office opened in 1870; it moved premises in 1888 and 1905, before moving to Roman Bank in 1929. As of 2020, Royal Mail&#x27;s Skegness Delivery Office operates there; Post Offices also operate on Burgh Road and Drummond Road in Skegness, and at Winthorpe Avenue in Seathorne. A wireless telegraph station operated at Winthorpe from 1926 to 1939. Lincolnshire County Library Service opened a branch in 1929 which was run by volunteers. In the 1930s, the council purchased a former shop on Roman Bank and converted it into the current library, run by full-time staff. , it opens every day except Sunday.

=== Emergency services and justice ===

In 1827 the village was afforded its first police constable, which it shared with Ingoldmells. The town&#x27;s first police station opened in 1883 on Roman Bank. In 1932, Skegness became a divisional police headquarters. Its current building opened in 1975. Criminal cases were heard in Spilsby until Skegness was granted its own petty sessions in 1908; these operated only during summer until 1929, when cases were heard there year-round; a court opened on Roman Bank that year. The building was replaced in 1975 and the Spilsby magistrates court closed in 1980, transferring all cases to Skegness. By 1913, the town had a fire brigade. A station was added to the Town Hall on the corner of Roman Bank and Algitha Road in the late 1920s. A new station was built on Churchill Avenue in 1973. It continues to operate as of 2020.

Skegness had a signal station by 1812 and four years later a mortar-fired brass lifeline was put in place in the village. In 1825, a lifeboat was purchased for Wainfleet Haven and first launched from Gibraltar Point in 1827; it moved to Skegness in 1830. A new boathouse was built in 1864 on South Parade and rebuilt in 1892. Motorised tractors were used to pull the boats after 1926 and the last sailing boat was retired four years later. The current lifeboat station was built in 1990.

=== Healthcare ===
Skegness and District General Hospital opened in 1913 as a cottage hospital; it underwent major redevelopment works in 1939, was taken over by the National Health Service nine years later and extended in 1985. As of June 2020, it is a community hospital run by the Lincolnshire Community Health Services NHS Trust; some of its services are provided by the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (ULH). It contains two in-patient wards, with 39 beds (including three in palliative care) and its services include a 24-hour, walk-in Urgent Care Centre. ULH runs Accident and Emergency departments at Lincoln County Hospital and Pilgrim Hospital in Boston. As of 2020, the town has two GP practices (on Hawthorn Road and Churchill Avenue), four dental practices (three on Algitha Road and one on Ida Road), and three opticians. There are community mental health services provided at Holly Lodge. There is a health centre on Cecil Avenue and the hospital includes a contraception and general health advice centre.

== Education ==

Skegness&#x27;s first elementary school was established in 1839. Winthorpe&#x27;s first schoolhouse opened in 1865. As part of Lord Scarbrough&#x27;s town plan, Skegness National School opened on Roman Bank in 1880; in 1932 it was replaced with another elementary school, Skegness Senior Council School, which existed until it became a secondary modern school in the 1940s. The county-council run Infants&#x27; School was founded on Cavendish Road in 1908, followed by Skegness County Junior School in 1935 (renamed Skegness Junior School in 1999), the Seathorne Junior School in 1951 (replacing the Winthorpe School which closed) and Richmond Junior School in 1976. As of 2020, the town is served by five coeducational state primary schools, four of which are academies: the Skegness Infant Academy (established when the infant school became an academy in 2012); Skegness Junior Academy (which replaced the Junior School in 2012); Seathorne Primary Academy (which replaced Seathorne Primary School in 2019); The Richmond School; and Beacon Primary Academy (opened as a new school in 2014). As of 2020, one private primary school operates in the town: The Viking School, which opened in 1982.

Before 1933, the only secondary education available to Skegness&#x27;s children was at Magdalen College School, a grammar school in Wainfleet. In 1933, it closed and was replaced by the coeducational Skegness Grammar School, which opened in the town and continues to select pupils using the eleven-plus examination; it provides boarding facilities for pupils who do not live locally. Having previously been grant-maintained and a foundation status school, Skegness Grammar School converted to an academy in 2012. At its last Ofsted inspection report in 2017, it was assessed as &quot;requiring improvement&quot;. As of 2020, there are 456 pupils on the roll, out of a capacity of 898. The passage of the Education Act 1944 made secondary education compulsory for pupils aged 11–15 from 1945. The Skegness Secondary Modern School opened as a result; it was renamed the Lumley Secondary Modern School in 1956. Another school, the Morris Secondary Modern, opened in 1955. They merged in 1986 to form the Earl of Scarbrough School, which closed in 2004 and reopened as St Clements College, a community school which converted into Skegness Academy in 2010. It is coeducational and has a sixth form; at its 2020 Ofsted inspection, it was assessed as &quot;requiring improvement&quot;. There were 893 pupils on roll in that year, out of a capacity of 1,340.

Both of the secondary schools provide education for pupils aged 16–18. Other providers of further education include the Skegness College of Vocational Training (a private centre founded in 1975); First College, which formed in 2000 following a merger of the East Lindsey Information Technology Centre (East Lindsey ITeC) which had opened in Skegness in 1984; and the Skegness TEC, which in 2017 replaced the Lincolnshire Regional College in Skegness (founded in 2009).

== Religious sites ==

The three Anglican places of worship are the churches of St Clement and St Matthew in Skegness, and St Mary&#x27;s Church in Winthorpe. St Clement&#x27;s and St Mary&#x27;s have medieval origins. When the seaside resort was being planned in the 1870s, St Clement&#x27;s was too small and far from the new town so the much larger St Matthew&#x27;s Church was built on Scarbrough Avenue and consecrated in 1885. As of 2020, services are usually held every Sunday in St Matthew&#x27;s, and in St Mary&#x27;s and St Clement&#x27;s on all but the first Sunday of the month. The parishes of Skegness and Winthorpe were united in 1978; its legal name is Skegness with Winthorpe. The parish forms part of the Skegness Group, which includes the parishes of Ingoldmells and Addlethorpe. It is in the Calcewaithe and Candleshoe rural deanery in the archdeaconry and diocese of Lincoln.

Skegness also has a Roman Catholic church, the Church of the Sacred Heart on Grosvenor Road; it has been based there since 1950, having previously occupied the town&#x27;s first purpose-built Catholic church since 1898.

As of 2020, Skegness Methodist Chapel on Algitha Road holds services on Sundays and mid-morning prayers on Mondays. St Paul&#x27;s Baptist Church also holds regular Sunday services. The Salvation Army has had a unit in the town since 1913 and built its citadel on the High Street in 1929; it remains in use as of 2020. The Assemblies of God Pentecostal Church was registered as a charity in 1996; it later changed its name to the New Day Christian Centre and moved to new premises in 2011; as of 2020 it operates on North Parade as The Storehouse Church and, as well as running church services, provides Skegness&#x27;s only food bank. As of 2020, there is a seventh-day adventist church on Philip Grove.

In 2019, East Lindsey Council approved plans for a mosque and community centre on Roman Bank.

== Culture ==
=== Visitor attractions ===
The &quot;Rough Guides&quot; describe Skegness as &quot;every inch the traditional English seaside town&quot;. Its long, wide, sandy beach is a main attraction for visitors; described as &quot;sparklingly clean&quot; by &quot;Rough Guides&quot;, in 2019 it was re-awarded the Foundation for Environmental Education&#x27;s Blue Flag award which recognises the beach&#x27;s high-quality water, facilities, beach safety, management and environmental education facilities. Between 1 May and 30 September, dogs are banned from the beach. Donkey rides are offered for children there.

The seafront includes Skegness Pier, which houses amusements; to the south, Botton&#x27;s Pleasure Beach is a funfair with roller coasters and other rides. Further south still is the Jubilee Clock Tower and the boating lake and Fairy Dell paddling pool. The western side of Grand Parade houses amusements and eateries, punctuated by the entrance to Tower Gardens, a park; its pavilion, which dated to 1879, was demolished in 2019–20 and a community centre and café built on its site. Opposite the gardens is the Embassy Theatre. The town&#x27;s nightlife includes bars, pubs and nightclubs.

Natureland Seal Sanctuary, on North Parade, rescues and houses distressed seals; it also features penguins, aquariums, and other animals. The town has an aquarium (Skegness Aquarium), which opened on Tower Esplanade in 2015. Further into the town, The Village Church Farm (formerly Church Farm Museum) contains exhibitions about historical farming life. A volunteer-run heritage railway, the Lincolnshire Coast Light Railway, moved to Skegness in 1990 and opened to fare-paying members of the public in 2009; it operates along a length of track.

To the south of Skegness is Gibraltar Point, a national nature reserve, consisting of unspoilt marshland. It was among England&#x27;s earliest bird observatories when it was established in 1949 and, as of 2020, is open to the public. Alongside walkways and paths, it has a visitor centre, café and toilet facilities.

=== Arts and music ===

Skegness Carnival operates as an annual event in August as of 2020; the town hosted its first carnival in 1898, but the modern event dates to 1933. Since 2009, Skegness has held a music, art and cultural event, the SO Festival; in 2013 the district council estimated that it generated £1m for the area. In 1928, as part of the local authority&#x27;s foreshore development, the Embassy Ballroom was built on Grand Parade. It was remodelled in 1982 and completely rebuilt in 1999 as the Embassy Theatre Complex, which is Skegness&#x27;s only theatre as of 2020. The town has two cinemas: the Tower Cinema (opened in 1922) and an ABC Cinema (opened in 1936), as of 2020.

The Skegness Boys&#x27; Brigade Band started in 1908; it was disbanded on the outbreak of the First World War. A new band was formed in 1923 or 1928, as Skegness Town Band, which later changed its name to Skegness Silver Band. The band continues to operate as of 2020. The Skegness Excelsior Band also operated in the interwar period. The town&#x27;s amateur dramatic society, the Skegness Playgoers, was founded in 1937. As of 2020, they aim to put on two productions a year at the Embassy Theatre.

=== Sport ===
Skegness is home to Skegness Town A.F.C., which plays at the Vertigo Stadium on Wainfleet Road; known as The Lilywhites, the club was founded in 1947 and has been in the Northern Counties East Football League since 2018. Another team, Skegness United F.C., folded in 2018. The town has a rugby club, Skegness R.U.F.C., which plays in the Midlands 4 East (North) division of the Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire Rugby Football Union, and has a clubhouse on Wainfleet Road. Skegness Cricket Club traces its origins to at least 1877 and has its ground on Richmond Drive. There is also the Skegness Yacht Club, Indoor Bowls Club and Skegness Town Bowls Club. Skegness Stadium, just outside the town, hosts stock car racing. Seacroft golf course is a traditional 18-hole links course at the southern end of Skegness. It was designed by Willie Fernie and opened in 1900, replacing a 9-hole course built in 1895.

=== Media ===
In 1922, the proprietors of the &quot;Lincolnshire Standard&quot; group of newspapers established a local version for the town, the &quot;Skegness Standard&quot;; it switched to tabloid in 1981; the &quot;Standard&quot; continues as a weekly as of 2020. Founded in 2001, the &quot;East Lindsey Target&quot; became the &quot;East Coast and The Wolds Target&quot; in 2017, and continues as of 2020. Former newspapers include the &quot;Skegness Herald&quot; (1882–1917) and the &quot;Skegness News&quot; (1909–1964; revived in 1985 but merged into the &quot;Skegness Standard&quot; in 2007).

Skegness is covered by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire. Local radio stations that broadcast to Skegness are BBC Radio Lincolnshire, Hits Radio Lincolnshire and Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire. Coastal Sound radio (founded in 2016) is a community radio service broadcasting from Skegness to the area and beyond by way of the internet.

== Historic buildings ==

Skegness&#x27;s oldest buildings are the medieval churches of St Clement, in Skegness, and St Mary, in Winthorpe. St Clement&#x27;s has a 13th-century tower; the rest of the building may be medieval, but probably dates to the mid-16th century when it is thought to have been rebuilt. There were restorations in 1884 and the 20th-century and it is grade-II* listed. St Mary&#x27;s is grade-I listed and is mostly 15th-century, with some late 12th-century elements. There are some 16th-century monumental brasses, and a medieval standing cross in the churchyard, which is a scheduled monument. Other buildings which predate the modern resort town include the Ivy House Farmhouse on Burgh Road, which dates to the mid or late 18th century, Church Farmhouse on Church Road, which dates to the early 18th century and hosts the Church Farm Museum, the 18th-century Church Farmhouse on Church End, Winthorpe, and the early-19th-century Burnside Farmhouse. The houses at 1–5 St Andrew&#x27;s Drive are mid- to late-19th-century cottages and thought to have been built to house coastguards.

Parts of the Victorian development have been recognised for their special interest. These include the Church of St Matthew and the war memorial in its churchyard, the Jubilee Clock Tower (built in 1898 and a landmark in the town), and portions of original railings dating from the 1870s which are situated to the south and north of the clock tower; these are all grade-II listed structures. A large portion of the later esplanade, boating lake, land north of the pier and tower gardens is also grade-II listed. South Parade and Grand Parade contain 19th- and 20th-century boarding houses in the Queen Anne revival style. Modern buildings of note include the Sun Castle (1932), County Hotel (1935) and The Ship Hotel (&quot;c&quot;. 1935).

== Notable people ==

Skegness has been home to several people associated with the entertainment industry. Billy Butlin first set up his amusements stall on the seafront in the 1920s, opened the fairground rides south of the pier in 1929 and then established the first of his all-in holiday camps at Ingoldmells in 1936. Among performers connected with the town was the comedian Arthur Lucan, who grew up in the Boston area and busked in Skegness after leaving home. The actress Elizabeth Allan was born in the town. The rock singer and songwriter Graham Bonnet was born in Skegness in 1947. The comedian Dave Allen worked as a redcoat at Butlins early in his career. The disgraced clergyman Harold Davidson performed in a circus act in the amusement park in 1937 (while campaigning for his reinstatement to the priesthood), but died that year in the town after being mauled by one of his lions. The clown Jacko Fossett retired to Skegness.

Several notable religious figures either lived in the town or served it in some capacity: Edward Steere was curate from 1858 to 1862, George William Clarkson was rector from 1944 to 1948, Roderick Wells was rector from 1971 to 1978, and Kenneth Thompson lived in the town.

Local sportspeople include Anne Pashley (died 2016), the Olympic athlete and (latterly) opera singer, who was born at Wallace&#x27;s holiday camp in Skegness in 1935.

Among golfers, Mark Seymour died in Skegness in 1952, and Helen Dobson was born there in 1971.

Others with links to Skegness include the poet and art critic William Cosmo Monkhouse, who died in the town in 1901, and the novelist Vernon Scannell, who was born there in 1922. The former tabloid editor Neil Wallis started his journalistic career at the &quot;Skegness Standard&quot; in the 1960s. Reginald J. G. Dutton, who created the shorthand Dutton Speedwords, chaired Skegness Urban District Council.

<text>The Bell X-2 (nicknamed &quot;Starbuster&quot;) was an X-plane research aircraft built to investigate flight characteristics in the Mach 2–3 range. The X-2 was a rocket-powered, swept-wing research aircraft developed jointly in 1945 by Bell Aircraft Corporation, the United States Army Air Forces and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to explore aerodynamic problems of supersonic flight and to expand the speed and altitude regimes obtained with the earlier X-1 series of research aircraft.

==Design and development==
The Bell X-2 was developed to provide a vehicle for researching flight characteristics at speeds and altitudes in excess of the capabilities of the Bell X-1 and D-558 II, while investigating aerodynamic heating problems in what was then called the &quot;thermal thicket&quot;.

The Bell X-2 had a prolonged development period due to the advances needed in aerodynamic design, control systems, materials that retained adequate mechanical properties at high temperature, and other technologies that had to be developed. Not only did the X-2 push the envelope of manned flight to speeds, altitudes and temperatures beyond any other aircraft at the time, it pioneered throttleable rocket engines in U.S. aircraft (previously demonstrated on the Me 163B during World War II) and digital flight simulation. The XLR25 rocket engine, built by Curtiss-Wright, was based on the smooth variable-thrust JATO engine built by Robert Goddard in 1942 for the Navy.

Providing adequate stability and control for aircraft flying at high supersonic speeds was only one of the major difficulties facing flight researchers as they approached Mach 3. For, at speeds in that region, they knew they would also begin to encounter a &quot;thermal barrier&quot;, severe heating effects caused by aerodynamic friction. Constructed of stainless steel and a copper-nickel alloy called K-Monel, and powered by a liquid propellant (alcohol and oxygen) two-chamber Curtiss-Wright XLR25 2,500 to 15,000 lbf (11 to 67 kN) sea level thrust, continuously throttleable rocket engines, the swept-wing Bell X-2 was designed to probe the supersonic region.

==Operational history==
Following a drop launch from a modified B-50 bomber, Bell test pilot Jean &quot;Skip&quot; Ziegler completed the first unpowered glide flight of an X-2 at Edwards Air Force Base on 27 June 1952. Ziegler and aircraft #2 (46-675) were subsequently lost on 12 May 1953, in an inflight explosion during a captive flight intended to check the aircraft&#x27;s liquid oxygen system. A B-50 crew member, Frank Wolko, was also killed during the incident. The wreckage of the aircraft fell into Lake Ontario and was not recovered.

Lt. Col. Frank K. &quot;Pete&quot; Everest completed the first powered flight in the #1 airplane (46-674) on 18 November 1955. By the time of his ninth and final flight in late July 1956 the project was years behind schedule, but he had established a new speed record of Mach 2.87 (1,900 mph, 3,050 km/h). About this time, the YF-104A was demonstrating speeds of Mach 2.2 or 2.3 in a fighter configuration. The X-2 was living up to its promise, but not without difficulties. At high speeds, Everest reported its flight controls were only marginally effective. High speed center of pressure shifts along with fin aeroelasticity were major factors. Moreover, simulation and wind tunnel studies, combined with data from his flights, suggested the airplane would encounter very severe stability problems as it approached Mach 3.

Captains Iven C. Kincheloe and Milburn G. &quot;Mel&quot; Apt were assigned the job of &quot;envelope expansion&quot; and, on 7 September 1956, Kincheloe became the first pilot ever to climb above 100,000 ft (30,500 m) as he flew the X-2 to a peak altitude of 126,200 ft (38,470 m). Just 20 days later, on the morning of 27 September, Apt was launched from the B-50 for his first flight in a rocket airplane. He had been instructed to follow the &quot;optimum maximum energy flight path&quot;. With nozzle extenders and a longer than normal motor run, Apt flew an extraordinarily precise profile; he became the first man to exceed Mach 3, reaching Mach 3.2 (2,094 mph, 3,370 km/h) at 65,500 ft (19,960 m).

The flight had been flawless to this point, but shortly after attaining top speed, Apt attempted a banking turn while the aircraft was still above Mach 3 (lagging instrumentation may have indicated he was flying at a slower speed or perhaps he feared he was straying too far from the safety of his landing site on Rogers Dry Lake). The X-2 tumbled violently out of control and he found himself struggling with three sequential coupling modes, control coupling, inertial roll coupling and supersonic spinning. &quot;Inertia coupling&quot; and a subsonic inverted spin had overtaken Chuck Yeager in the X-1A nearly three years before. Yeager, although exposed to much higher vehicle inertial forces, was able to recover. Apt attempted to recover from a spin, but could not. The rudder lock was still on in the attempted spin recovery. He fired the ejection capsule, which was itself only equipped with a relatively small drogue parachute. Apt was probably disabled by the severe release forces. As the capsule fell for several minutes to the desert floor, he did not exit so that he could use his personal parachute before ground impact, and was killed. The aircraft continued to fly in a series of glides and stalls before landing and breaking into three pieces (separate from the capsule). A proposal to salvage the aircraft and modify it for a hypersonic test program was not approved. The aircraft was scrapped.

The subsequent investigation into the X-2&#x27;s fatal flight raised numerous contributing factors into the crashlargely focusing on Apt&#x27;s decision to turn the aircraft while still above Mach 3. Some cited his lack of experience with rocket planes, but, as historian Chris Petty notes, &quot;he had in fact flown the complex profile almost perfectly, but this, combined with additional seconds of thrust from the XLR25 [engine], had carried the X-2 well beyond the envelope of knowledge and into the uncertain stability predicted by the GEDA [Goodyear Electronic Differential Analyzer computer].&quot; In short, Petty suggests that Apt did his job too well and may have been pushed to exceed Mach 3 by the AFFTC and conflicting priorities within it. Petty quotes Base commander General Stanley Holtoner: &quot;I think that every supervisory guy from me on down has criticized himself, because if we had told this boy [Apt] to stop at a specific speed, this wouldn&#x27;t have happened.&quot;

One point that became clear even before the investigation was that the X-2&#x27;s escape mechanism was woefully inadequate. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporting on the event, Everest had criticized the relatively new detachable capsule, maintaining that &quot;some safety had been sacrificed in preference to delaying the X-2 flight tests while the escape mechanism was modified.&quot; Another NACA research pilot, Scott Crossfield, described it more bluntly as a &quot;way to commit suicide to keep from getting killed.&quot;

While the X-2 had delivered valuable research data on high-speed aerodynamic heat build-up and extreme high-altitude flight conditions (although it is unclear how much, as the unmanned Lockheed X-7 and IM-99 were among the winged vehicles operating at comparable or higher velocities in this era), this tragic event terminated the program before the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics could commence detailed flight research with the aircraft. The search for answers to many of the riddles of high-Mach flight had to be postponed until the arrival three years later of the most advanced of all the experimental rocket aircraft, the North American X-15.

===Flight test program===
Two aircraft completed a total of 20 flights (27 June 1952 – 27 September 1956).

*&quot;46-674&quot;: seven glide flights, 10 powered flights, crashed 27 September 1956, subsequently scrapped
*&quot;46-675&quot;: three glide flights, destroyed 12 May 1953
