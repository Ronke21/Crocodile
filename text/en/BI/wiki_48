<text>Republika Srpska (, , also referred to as the Republic of Srpska or Serb Republic) is one of the two entities within Bosnia and Herzegovina, the other being the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Situated in the northern and eastern regions of the country, it recorded a population of 1,228,423 in the 2013 census. Its largest city and administrative hub is Banja Luka, located on the banks of the Vrbas River.

Republika Srpska was established in 1992 at the onset of the Bosnian War with the stated purpose of safeguarding the interests of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the conflict, the expulsion of the majority of Croats and Bosniaks from territories controlled by Republika Srpska occurred, while expulsion of the majority Serbs from from territories controlled by Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina occurred in modern-day Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina region. In 1995 the Dayton Agreement officially recognized Republika Srpska as one of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s two constituent entities. Today, it is predominantly inhabited by the Serb population of the country.

The entity operates under a parliamentary system, with legislative power vested in the National Assembly, which comprises 83 seats. While Republika Srpska is relatively centralized, it is administratively divided into 64 municipalities, known as &quot;opštine&quot; (singular: &quot;opština&quot;). The current legislative term marks the tenth session since its inception.

==Name==

In the name &#x27;, &#x27; is a noun derived from the ethnonym of the Serbs with a different suffix than &#x27; ‘Serbia’. In Serbian, many names of countries are formed with the &#x27; suffix (e.g. &#x27; ‘Bulgaria’, &#x27; ‘Denmark’, &#x27; ‘Finland’, &#x27; ‘Croatia’, &#x27; ‘Ireland’, &#x27; ‘Turkey’). An analogous English formation would be &quot;Serbland&quot; (which has been used sporadically). The government uses the name “Republic of Srpska” in English.

Although is variously glossed in English as “Serb Republic”, “Bosnian Serb Republic”, or “Republic of Srpska”, the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and English-language news sources such as the BBC, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; generally refer to the entity by its transliteration.

According to &quot;Glas Srpske&quot;, a Banja Luka daily, the modern entity&#x27;s name was created by its first minister of culture, Ljubomir Zuković.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Archaeological evidence in Republika Srpska, as well as bordering areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, attest to pronounced human activity in the Paleolithic. Specifically, in 1976, near the modern-day town of Stolac in the then relatively hospitable Neretva basin, archaeological artifacts in the form of cave engravings in Badanj and deer bones in the area were discovered to show hunter-gatherer activity from as far back as 14,000–10,000 BC. Within the wider region of Herzegovina, similar discoveries tie the region&#x27;s early activities to Montenegro and coastal Croatia.

With the Neolithic, however, came more permanent settlement. Naturally, this occurred along the rivers of Bosnia and Herzegovina as farming spread from the southeast; most notably, the Butmir culture developed near today&#x27;s East Sarajevo on the river Bosna. A variety of idols, mostly of female character, were found in the Butmir site, along with dugouts.

With the Indo-European migrations of the Bronze Age came the first use of metal tools in the region. Along with this came the construction of burial mounds—tumuli, or kurgans. Remains of these mounds can be found in northwestern Bosnia near Prijedor, testament to not only denser settlement in the northern core of today&#x27;s Republika Srpska but also Bronze Age relics.

With the influx of the Iron Age, the Glasinac culture, developing near Sokolac in eastern Republika Srpska, was one of the most important of the country&#x27;s long-standing Indo-European inhabitants, the Illyrians. Later, these Illyrians—the Autariatae—were influenced by the Celts after the Gallic invasion of the Balkans.

=== Roman period ===

With the end of the Illyrian Wars, most of Bosnia and Herzegovina came under Roman control within the province of Illyricum. In this period, the Romans consolidated the region through the construction of a dense road network and the Romanisation of the local population. Among these roads was the &quot;Via Argentaria&quot;, or &#x27;Silver Way&#x27;, which transported silver from the eastern mines of Bosnia to Roman population centres. Modern placenames, such as the Una and Sana rivers in the northwest, have Latin origins, meaning &quot;the one&quot; and &quot;the healthy&quot;, respectively. This rule was not uninterrupted, however; with the suppression of the once-dominant Illyrian population came revolts such as the Bellum Batonianum. After 20 AD, however, the entirety of the country was conquered by the Romans and it was split between Pannonia and Dalmatia. The most prominent Roman city in Bosnia was the relatively small Servitium, near modern-day Gradiška in the northern part of the entity.

Christianity spread to the region relatively late at least partially due to the countryside&#x27;s mountainous nature and its lack of large settlements. In the fourth century, however, the country began to be Christianised en masse. With the split of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires in 395, modern-day Republika Srpska fell under the Western Roman Empire. Testament to its and Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s later religious polarisation, it was later conquered as a frontier of the Eastern Roman Empire, a harbinger for religious division to come.

=== Middle Ages ===

With the loosening of Roman grip on the region came the Migration Period which, given Republika Srpska&#x27;s position in southeastern Europe, involved a wide variety of peoples. Among the first was the invasion of Germanic peoples from the east and north, and the territory became a part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in 476.

By 535, the territory was taken once again by the Byzantine Empire. At this time, the Empire&#x27;s grip was once again relatively loose and Slavs invaded the surrounding area. Modern-day Republika Srpska was therefore split between the mediaeval Kingdom of Croatia and, according to De Administrando Imperio, mediaeval Serbian &quot;županije&quot;, including, Bosna, Zachlumia, Travunija, and Serbia, then including land in eastern Bosnia. Parts of present-day Srpska were locations of settlement of the original White Serb people.
By the end of the 11th century, the entirety of Bosnia became part of the Hungarian Crown Lands. Under Hungarian rule the area was known as the Banate of Bosnia. Later, however, with the rule of Ban Kulin, who is regarded as the founder of Bosnia, the region became &quot;de facto&quot; independent. In 1377, the Banate of Bosnia became the medieval Kingdom of Bosnia, under Tvrtko I of House of Kotromanić. The capitals of the kingdom were all located in its centre, while the northern periphery remained under nominal Hungarian rule as the region of Usora. Architectural legacies from this period include Kastel Fortress in Banja Luka, the fortress of Doboj as well as castles, churches, and monasteries across the country.

With the growth of the Ottoman Empire, Stefan Tomašević, the last Kotromanić ruler, surrendered Bosnia and Serbia to Ottoman tributary status. A Catholic, he was unpopular among the Orthodox population of Serbia, as well as the members of the Bosnian Church. Refusing to pay tribute to Mehmed the Conqueror, King Stefan was executed and much of Bosnia fell under direct Ottoman rule in 1463 as the Eyalet of Bosnia. The entirety of the country fell in 1482, with the founding of the Sanjak of Herzegovina.

=== 16th to 19th centuries ===

Ottoman rule in modern-day Republika Srpska saw another addition to its religious fabric—Islam. Members of the Bosnian Church, as well as many Orthodox and Catholic Bosnians, gradually converted to Islam. Ottoman rule left a profound architectural legacy in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. The most famous mosque from this period is the Ferhadija mosque, located in Banja Luka. In addition, the subject of Ivo Andrić&#x27;s book &quot;The Bridge on the Drina,&quot; Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge in Višegrad, was constructed by Mimar Sinan, the most famous Ottoman architect, in 1577, for Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha. Years earlier, the same Grand Vizier was born into an Orthodox family in a small town in Bosnia and taken from his parents as a child for upbringing as a janissary. His bridge is a symbol of the religious and cultural spans—and eventually conflict—that characterise Republika Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

With the Ottoman-Habsburg conflicts of the late 17th and 18th centuries, parts of northern Republika Srpska became a part of the Habsburg Empire for relatively short periods of time. Rule was more permanent following Austro-Hungarian invasion in 1878. Characterised by economic and social development not seen in the by-then backwards Ottoman Empire, Austro-Hungarian rule was welcomed by many. However, many Muslims left Bosnia, leaving Serbs as the majority in the entirety of the Condominium.

=== 20th century ===

With the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, carried out by Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Yugoslavist Mlada Bosna, World War I broke out in 1914. Following the war, the territory of modern-day Republika Srpska was incorporated into the Vrbas, Drina, and Zeta banovinas of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, renamed Yugoslavia in 1929.

Following the outbreak of World War II and the invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, modern-day Republika Srpska fell under the rule of the Nazi puppet state, The Independent State of Croatia. Around 300,000 Serbs are estimated to have died under the Ustashe regime as a result of their genocide campaign; a slew of massacres, as well as the use of a variety of concentration and extermination camps, took place in Republika Srpska during the war. The Jasenovac concentration camp, located in modern-day Croatia, was the site of the deaths of some 100,000 people, about 47,000-52,000 of which were Serbs. Massacres also occurred at Garavice and Kruščica concentration camp in the eastern part of Bosnia. The regime systematically and brutally massacred Serbs in villages in the countryside, using a variety of tools. The scale of the violence meant that approximately every sixth Serb living in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the victim of a massacre and virtually every Serb had a family member that was killed in the war, mostly by the Ustaše. An estimated 209,000 Serbs or 16.9% of its Bosnia population were killed on the territory of Bosnia–Herzegovina during the war. Today, monuments honouring these victims can be found across Republika Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Yugoslav royalist and Serbian nationalist movement Chetniks, a guerilla force that engaged in tactical or selective collaboration with the occupying forces for almost all of the war, pursued genocide against Croats and Bosniaks, which included thousands of Croat and Bosniak civilians killed on the territory of modern-day Republika Srpska. The Chetniks killed an estimated 50,000 to 68,000 Muslims and Croats. A December 1941 directive, attributed to Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, explicitly ordered the ethnic cleansing of Muslims and Croats from Sandžak and Bosnia and Herzegovina. About 300 villages and small towns were destroyed, along with a large number of mosques and Catholic churches. The Chetniks were almost exclusively made up of Serbs except for a large number of Montenegrins who identified as Serbs.

During the entire course of WWII in Yugoslavia, 64.1% of all Bosnian Partisans were Serbs.

After World War II came a period of relative peace and economic development. Ljubija mine and companies like Agrokomerc played a vital role in much of the economic development of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Literacy rates increased greatly, and the University of Banja Luka was founded in 1975.

=== Bosnian War ===

==== Bosnian War and the proclamation of the Republika Srpska====


Representatives of main political parties and some other national organisations and institutions of Serb people in Bosnia and Herzegovina met on 13 October 1990 in Banja Luka and formed the &#x27;Serbian National Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27; as a Serb political body. In a session on 14–15 October 1991, the People&#x27;s Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, then part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, approved the &#x27;Memorandum on Sovereignty&#x27;, as had already been done by Slovenia and Croatia, as a way to proclaim independence from the rest of Yugoslavia. The memorandum was adopted despite opposition from 83 Serb deputies belonging to the Serb Democratic Party (most of the Serb parliamentary representatives) as well as the Serbian Renewal Movement and the Union of Reform Forces, who regarded the move as illegal.

On 24 October 1991, the Serb deputies formed the Assembly of the Serb People in Bosnia and Herzegovina (&quot;Skupština srpskog naroda u Bosni i Hercegovini&quot;) to be the highest representative and legislative body of the Bosnian Serb population, ending the tripartite coalition.

The Union of Reform Forces soon ceased to exist but its members remained in the assembly as the Independent Members of Parliament Caucus. The assembly undertook to address the achievement of equality between the Serbs and other peoples and the protection of the Serbs&#x27; interests, which they contended had been jeopardised by decisions of the Bosnian parliament. On 9 January 1992, the assembly proclaimed the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina (), declaring it part of Yugoslavia.

On 28 February 1992, the assembly adopted the Constitution of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the name adopted instead of the previous &quot;Republika srpskog naroda Bosne i Hercegovine&quot;), which would include districts, municipalities, and regions where Serbs were the majority and also those where they had allegedly become a minority because of persecution during World War II. The republic was part of Yugoslavia and could enter into union with political bodies representing other peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Bosnian parliament, without its Serb deputies, held a referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 29 February and 1 March 1992, but most Serbs boycotted it since the assembly had previously (9–10 November 1991) held a plebiscite in the Serb regions, 96% having opted for membership of the Yugoslav federation formed by Serbia and Montenegro.
The referendum had a 64% turnout and 92.7% or 99% (according to different sources) voted for independence. On 6 March the Bosnian parliament promulgated the results of the referendum, proclaiming the republic&#x27;s independence from Yugoslavia. The republic&#x27;s independence was recognised by the European Community on 6 April 1992 and by the United States on 7 April. On the same day the Serbs&#x27; assembly in session in Banja Luka declared a severance of governmental ties with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The name &quot;Republika Srpska&quot; was adopted on 12 August 1992.

The political controversy escalated into the Bosnian War, which would last until the autumn of 1995.

The war was ended by the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, reached at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, on 21 November and formally signed in Paris on 14 December 1995. Annex 4 of the Agreement is the current Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, recognising Republika Srpska as one of its two main political-territorial divisions and defining the governmental functions and powers of the two entities. The boundary lines between the entities were delineated in Annex 2 of the Agreement.

Between 1992 and 2008, the Constitution of Republika Srpska was amended 121 times. Article 1 states that Republika Srpska is a territorially unified, indivisible, and inalienable constitutional and legal entity that shall perform its constitutional, legislative, executive, and judicial functions independently.

===Impact of war===
The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina resulted in major changes in the country, some of which were quantified in a 1998 UNESCO report. Some two million people, about half the country&#x27;s population, were displaced. In 1996 there were some 435,346 ethnic Serb refugees from the Federation in Republika Srpska, while another 197,925 had gone to Serbia. In 1991, 27% of the non-agricultural labour force was unemployed in Bosnia and this number increased due to the war. By 2009, the unemployment rate in Bosnia and Herzegovina was estimated at 29%, according to the CIA&#x27;s &quot;The World Factbook&quot;. Republika Srpska&#x27;s population of Serbs had increased by 547,741 due to the influx of ethnic Serb refugees from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the former unrecognised state of the Republic of Serbian Krajina in the new Republic of Croatia.
In Eastern Bosnia, Bosnian Serbs besieged the town of Srebrenica, among others. Srebrenica was declared a UN &#x27;Safe Area&#x27; in 1993 and it served as an enclave for Bosniak refugees for the final years of the Bosnian War. In the middle of July 1995, more than 8,000 Muslim Bosniaks, mainly men and boys, in and around the town of Srebrenica, were killed in what became known as the Srebrenica massacre, which was subsequently designated as an act of genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice.

Acts of ethnic cleansing against the non-Serb populations reduced the numbers of other groups. Serb police, soldiers, and irregulars attacked Muslims and Croats, and burned and looted their homes. Some were killed on the spot; others were rounded up and killed elsewhere, or forced to flee. The number of Croats was reduced by 135,386 (the majority of the pre-war population), and the number of Bosniaks by some 434,144. Some 136,000 of approximately 496,000 Bosniak refugees forced to flee the territory of what is now Republika Srpska have since returned home.
, 40% of Bosniaks and 8.5% of Croats had returned to Republika Srpska, while 14% of Serbs who left their homes in territories controlled by Bosniaks or Croats, also returned to their pre-war communities.

In the early 2000s, discrimination against non-Serbs was alleged by NGOs and the Helsinki Commission. The International Crisis Group reported in 2002 that in some parts of Republika Srpska a non-Serb returnee is ten times more likely to be the victim of violent crime than a local Serb. The Helsinki Commission, in a 2001 statement on &#x27;Tolerance and Non-Discrimination&#x27;, pointed at violence against non-Serbs, stating that in the cities of Banja Luka and Trebinje, mobs attacked people who sought to lay foundations for new mosques.

Non-Serbs have reported continuing difficulties in returning to their original homes and the assembly has a poor record of cooperation in apprehending individuals indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.

Organisations such as the Society for Threatened Peoples, reporting to the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2008, have made claims of discrimination against non-Serb refugees in Republika Srpska, particularly areas with high unemployment in the Drina Valley such as Srebrenica, Bratunac, Višegrad, and Foča.

According to the Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees of Bosnia and Herzegovina, European Union Police Mission, UNHCR, and other international organisations, security in both Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2015 was satisfactory.

==Politics==
According to its constitution, Republika Srpska has its own president, legislature (the 83-member unicameral National Assembly of Republika Srpska), executive government, police force, court system, customs service (under the state-level customs service), and postal service. It also has official symbols, including a coat of arms, a flag (a variant of the Serbian flag without the coat of arms displayed) and its entity anthem. The Constitutional Law on the Coat of Arms and Anthem of Republika Srpska was ruled not in concordance with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina as it states that those symbols &#x27;represent the statehood of Republika Srpska&#x27; and are used &#x27;in accordance with moral norms of the Serb people&#x27;. According to the Constitutional Court&#x27;s decision, the Law was to be corrected by September 2006. Republika Srpska later changed its emblem.

Although the constitution names Sarajevo as the capital of Republika Srpska, the northwestern city of Banja Luka is the headquarters of most of the institutions of government, including the parliament, and is, therefore, the &quot;de facto&quot; capital. After the war, Republika Srpska retained its army, but in August 2005, the parliament consented to transfer control of Army of Republika Srpska to a state-level ministry and abolish the entity&#x27;s defence ministry and army by 1 January 2006. These reforms were required by NATO as a precondition of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s admission to the Partnership for Peace programme. Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the programme in December 2006.

In July 2023, legislation was passed to criminalise insult and defamation with up to 10 years in prison. This is likely to jeopardize freedom of speech and silence critics. Critics have said that this could make the Republika Srpska an authoritarian regime.

==Geography==

Situated in Southeast Europe, Republika Srpska is located on the Balkan Peninsula, with its northern extents reaching into the Pannonian Basin. Republika Srpska lies between latitudes 42° and 46° N and longitudes 16° and 20° E. The entity is split into two main parts by the Brčko District; a hilly western part and a more varied eastern part, with high mountains in the south and flat, fertile farmland in the north. Republika Srpska, unlike its counterpart entity, is landlocked.

Like the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska is split into a Bosnian region in the north and a Herzegovinian region in the far south. Within these two macroregions exist smaller geographical regions, from the forested hills of Bosanska Krajina in the northwest to the fertile plains of Semberija in the northeast.

Republika Srpska covers , excluding the Brčko District, which is held in condominium by both entities, but is &quot;de facto&quot; sovereign within Bosnia and Herzegovina. Republika Srpska, if it were a country, would be 146th largest in the world. Elevation varies greatly, with Maglić, a peak in the Dinaric Alps near Montenegro, reaching , and parts nearer the Adriatic going down to sea level. The largest and most popular ski resort in Bosnia and Herzegovina is situated on the slopes of the mountain Jahorina, in the eastern part of the entity. Other major mountains in Republika Srpska include Volujak, Zelengora, Lelija, Lebršnik, Crvanj, Orjen, Klekovača, Vitorog, Kozara, Romanija, Treskavica and Trebević.

===Boundary===
Republika Srpska shares international borders with Croatia to the north, Serbia to the east, and Montenegro to the southeast. Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Inter-Entity Boundary Line (IEBL) marks Republika Srpska&#x27;s administrative division with the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and essentially follows the front lines at the end of the Bosnian War with some adjustments (most importantly in the western part of the country and around Sarajevo) as defined by the Dayton Agreement. The total length of the IEBL is approximately km. The IEBL is an administrative demarcation uncontrolled by military or police and there is free movement across it.

=== Forests ===
Republika Srpska is one of the most forested areas in Europe, with over 50% of its area consisting of forest cover. Perućica is one of the last old-growth forests in Europe.

Two densely-wooded national parks—Sutjeska National Park and Kozara National Park—are located in the entity.

===Waters===

Most rivers belong to the Black Sea drainage basin. The principal rivers are the Sava, a tributary of the Danube that forms the northern boundary with Croatia; the Bosna, Vrbas, Sana and Una, which all flow north and empty into the Sava; the Drina, which flows north and forms a significant part of the eastern boundary with Serbia, and is also a tributary of the Sava. The Trebišnjica is one of the longest sinking rivers in the world. It belongs to the Adriatic Sea drainage basin. Skakavac Waterfall on the Perućica is one of the highest waterfalls in the country, at about in height. The most important lakes are Bileća Lake, Lake Bardača (which includes a protected wetland area) and Balkana Lake.

===National Parks===

==Demographics==

, Republika Srpska has a total population of 1,228,423 and a population density of 49.9 inhabitants per square kilometre; both of these figures are much lower than in Republika Srpska&#x27;s counterpart entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Republika Srpska comprises 48% of the land area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is home to 34.79% of the country&#x27;s total population. The overall life expectancy in Republika Srpska at birth was 77.15 years in 2019.

The Republika Srpska Bureau of Statistics estimated a population of 1,114,819 in 2023.

The total fertility rate in Republika Srpska is, as of 2019, 1.34 children per mother—one of the world&#x27;s lowest. In 2019, the total number of live births, according to the Institute of Statistics of Republika Srpska (RZS), was 9,274. That same year, the number of deaths was 15,081, resulting in a natural population decrease for 5,807 inhabitants. Along with this natural population decrease, the entity faces considerable emigration. A large number of people have left the entity in recent years for the nearby European Union and beyond.


=== Education ===

Literacy in Republika Srpska stands at 96.8 percent as of 2013. Free primary education is provided as a right to all people in Republika Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are 187 primary schools in addition to 11 music schools and 4 centres of education for students with learning disabilities. Secondary education exists in three main channels: three-year vocational schools, four-year technical schools, and four-year grammar schools (&quot;gimnazije&quot;). Ten independent grammar schools exist, while an additional 30 are integrated into other schools. Music schools offer another option for students to continue their education following primary school.

The oldest and largest public university in Republika Srpska is the University of Banja Luka, which was established in 1975. The second of two public universities in Republika Srpska is University of East Sarajevo. After the end of the Yugoslav wars several private institutions of higher education were established, including: American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slobomir University, and University Sinergija. The Academy of Sciences and Arts of Republika Srpska, founded in 1996, is the highest representative institution of science and art in Republika Srpska. National and University Library of Republika Srpska is a national library, located in Banja Luka. The Museum of Contemporary Art (MSURS) houses a collection of Yugoslav and international art and is located in Banja Luka.

===Ethnic groups===

===Healthcare===
The health care system of Republic of Srpska is intended to provide organized and planned health care to the population on its territory, both in public and private health care institutions. Health care activities are performed by health care workers and associates under the conditions and in the manner primarily prescribed by law and regulations, adopted on the basis, and in accordance with, the Law on Health Care of the Republic of Srpska.

The public sector of Srpska includes 54 health centers, along with family medicine clinics, 11 hospitals, 4 specialised hospitals, 1 clinical centre and 7 institutes.

According to the 2013 census, around 85% of the residents of Republika Srpska identify as Christian. Members of the Serbian Orthodox Church form the largest religious group, accounting for a little less than 83% of the population, followed by followers of Islam and Roman Catholicism. 0.59% of people describe themselves as atheist or agnostic.Religion plays an important role in ethnic identification in Republika Srpska. Serbs generally identify as followers of Eastern Orthodoxy, Croats as followers of the Catholic Church, and Bosniaks as followers of Islam. Religious architecture takes on a similarly diverse character in the entity, with its mix of mosques and churches.

==Economy==

Republika Srpska uses the Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark (KM). The currency is pegged to the euro at a unit rate of 1.95583 convertible marks. Along with the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska is classified as an upper-middle income economy by the United Nations. According to the IRBRS, the entity&#x27;s development bank, Republika Srpska&#x27;s nominal GDP per capita is 8,739 km (€4,457) as of 2017.

Republika Srpska&#x27;s corporate tax rate is lower than that of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is among the lowest in the region.

In November 2020 governments of Serbia and Srpska announced construction of three hydropower plants on the Drina estimated at EUR 520 million.

===External trade===
===Taxation and salaries===

Since 2001, Republika Srpska initiated significant reforms in the sector of the tax system, which lowered the tax burden to 28.6%, one of the lowest in the region. The 10% rate of capital gains tax and income tax are among the lowest in Europe. VAT has been introduced in 2006. These tax advantages have led to some companies moving their business to Republika Srpska from the other entity.

As of 2018, there are 266,309 employed people within legal entities in Republika Srpska. The average net wage, according to the Institute of Statistics of Republika Srpska (RZS), is 896 km (€458) per month as of February 2019, a nominal growth of 1.0% compared to the previous month.

<text>A  (plural &quot;flamines&quot;) was a priest of the ancient Roman religion who was assigned to one of fifteen deities with official cults during the Roman Republic. The most important of these were the three (or &quot;major priests&quot;), who served the important Roman gods Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus. The remaining twelve were the (&quot;lesser priests&quot;). Two of the served deities whose names are now unknown; among the others are deities about whom little is known other than the name. During the Imperial era, the cult of a deified emperor () also had a flamen.

The fifteen Republican flamens were members of the Pontifical College, who administered state-sponsored religion. When the office of flamen was vacant, a could serve as a temporary replacement, although only the is known to have substituted for the , one of the .

== Etymology ==
The etymology of remains obscure, and perhaps undecidable. The term is traditionally connected with the Proto-Germanic verb &quot;*blōtaną&quot; (&quot;to sacrifice&quot;; cf. Gothic &quot;blotan&quot;), by positing a Proto-Indo-European stem &quot;*bʰleh₂d-m(e)n-&quot; (or &quot;*bʰleh₂g-m(e)n-&quot;), which could have originally meant &quot;sacrifice&quot;. However, the link remains uncertain since it is impossible to decide whether the Latin form reflects an earlier &quot;flă-men&quot;, &quot;flăd-men&quot; or &quot;flăg-smen&quot;.

Indo-European scholar G. Dumézil attempted to link the term to the Sanskrit word &quot;brahman&quot;. Dumézil himself notes that the etymology has problems in terms of phonological shifts, and the cognates have not been universally accepted by modern scholars.
Andrew Sihler considers the claim that &quot;flamen&quot; might be a cognate of the Vedic term to be as plausible. He notes that the hypothesis of a connection to Gothic &quot;blotan&quot; and via Proto-Indo-European &quot;*bʰleh₂d-m(e)n-&quot; is equally plausible.

==History==
At the time of the religious reformation by Augustus, the origins and functions of many of the long-neglected gods resident in Rome were confusing even to the Romans themselves. The obscurity of some of the deities assigned a &quot;flamen&quot; (for example Falacer, Palatua, Quirinus and Volturnus) suggests that the office dated back to Archaic Rome. Many scholars assume that the existed at least from the time of the early Roman kings, prior to the establishment of the Republic. The Romans themselves credited the foundation of the priesthood to Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome. According to Livy, Numa created the offices of the three and assigned them each a fine robe of office and a curule chair. The were circumscribed by many taboos.

The &quot;flamen&quot; was a sacred position within Roman society; however, it could be used for political purposes. Certain people could be appointed as &quot;flamines&quot; to stop them from gaining power. For example, &quot;flamines&quot; were not allowed to ride a horse; therefore, this would make it extremely difficult for such a person to lead and command an army. By attaining such a position, the &quot;flamines&quot; were not permitted to run or hold a political office. There may have been &quot;flamines&quot; appointed simply to stop their progression in power and politics for reasons such as making enemies or simply jealousy.

In post-Antiquity usage, the designation &quot;flamen&quot; can apply, by extension, to priests in general.

== Appointment ==
The &quot;flamen&quot; was a high position within Roman society and religion. Therefore, the selection process was difficult for those wishing to be chosen as &quot;flamen&quot;. In the case of the &quot;Flamen Dialis&quot;, they were appointed by the Pontifex Maximus. By the Pontifical College, three nominations were given to the , those whom Romans believed to be the most worthy of such position. The Pontifex Maximus did not just select a new &quot;Flamen Dialis&quot;, but &quot;scrutinized each candidate&#x27;s qualifications in order to ensure that he and his wife were fit to serve.&quot; After the &quot;flamen&quot; and his wife were chosen, they then had to participate in a Roman tradition and ceremony known as &quot;captio&quot;. This ceremony was performed by an augur. It was the augur&#x27;s job to make sure the gods would accept the new &quot;flamen&quot;. This was done by asking for the king of the gods, Jupiter&#x27;s blessing, and the gods would respond by providing the proper signs to the people. These ceremonies were known as &quot;comitia calata&quot; (&quot;callate assemblies&quot;) and they were performed on the Capitoline Hill.

== Privileges and disadvantages ==
Such a position in Roman society came with many privileges which in turn gave &quot;flamines&quot; a unique power. In law and criminal courts, the &quot;flamen&quot; wielded great power. When a person was deemed a criminal, they could appeal to a &quot;flamen,&quot; who had the power of pardoning criminals. There were also several other privileges that the &quot;flamen&quot; possessed. According to Cyril Bailey these include: exemption from the &quot;Patria Potestas&quot; (lit. power of the father) of his father; the wearing of the &quot;toga praetexta&quot;; and, the privileges of having a lictor of his own, of sitting on the curule chair, and having an ex officio place in the Senate. During the sack of Rome by the Gauls in 390 BCE, the &quot;flamines&quot; were also given a special task. In an attempt to preserve Roman culture and history, the &quot;flamines&quot; and other religious orders such as the vestals were in charge of the sacred and religious items of Rome. Their objective was to take these treasures out of Rome so they would not be destroyed by the Gauls. Ralph Mathisen writes, &quot;Their sacred cult should not be abandoned as long as a single person survived to observe it&quot;.

The &quot;flamines&quot; were also prohibited from many different actions and rituals. In the case of death, &quot;flamines&quot; were in charge of performing ritual sacrificing. However, other than that, contact with anything related to death was prohibited so that the &quot;flamen&quot; could partake in his religious duties. One extreme example was in the case of the &quot;flamen&quot;&#x27;s wife (Latin, &quot;flaminica&quot;). They were not allowed to wear &quot;Calcei Morticini&quot;, &quot;shoes made from the skin of an animal that had died of natural causes.&quot; Since the animal was not part of a religious ritual or offered to the gods, these shoes would be seen as impure and disrespectful to the gods.

Another disadvantage for the &quot;flamines&quot; was that they &quot;were also forbidden to touch, see, or refer to yeast, raw meat, goats, dogs, ivy, or beans,&quot; because it was thought that these could interfere with the &quot;flamen&quot;&#x27;s religious practices. Most of these were associated with unsanitariness or death. When these &quot;flamines&quot; would have to perform ritual sacrifices, it was almost impossible for the flamen to avoid contact with raw meat. However, Roman accounts do not include such events in their writings. Another thing &quot;flamines&quot; were forbidden from was binding. They could not be bound to anything because it could hinder and jeopardize their position as &quot;flamen&quot;. Therefore, the only bind they were tied to was their religious position and priesthood.

== Marriage ==

A &quot;flamen&quot; had to be married. The &quot;flamen&quot; and his wife, the &quot;flaminica&quot;, were required to be patricians, and their parents had to be married through the ancient ceremony of &quot;confarreatio&quot;. This only applied to the &quot;flamen,&quot; because when they married his wife would become part of his family. Through the process of &quot;confarreatio&quot;, the wife would pass from the &quot;manus&quot; (hand) of her father to the hand of her husband. This transferred the father&#x27;s authority to her husband who would also become part of the religious cult. It was necessary for the wife to be a virgin and previously unwed before marriage to a prospective &quot;flamen&quot;. The &quot;flamen&quot; and the wife served together. In the case of either&#x27;s death, the surviving priest would then step down from their position. It was viewed as unlucky to be widowed.

&quot;The flamen&quot; and &quot;flaminica&quot; could not separate or divorce. The only way to escape a marriage was through death, because, once they attained their positions, they became the property of the deity they were assigned to. Since they ruled together, they were also responsible for performing certain rituals together. During certain practices and rituals, the &quot;flamen&quot; and &quot;flaminica&quot; had to follow certain rules, such as leaving during purification rituals. Another ritual practiced by the priest and priestess pertained to their bed. Only the &quot;flamen&quot; and &quot;flaminica&quot; were allowed to sleep in the bed for ritual reasons, and under no circumstance could they spend the night away from the bed for any longer than three days. This was meant to create and ensure a strong relationship between the couple. The end of the bed was lined with &quot;a thin layer of clay.&quot;

== Garb ==
The official costume of a &quot;flamen&quot;, allegedly of great antiquity, was a hat called an &quot;apex&quot; and a heavy cloak called a &quot;laena&quot;. The &quot;laena&quot; was a double-thick wool cloak with a fringed edge, and was worn over the flamen&#x27;s toga with a clasp to hold it around his throat. The &quot;apex&quot; was a leather skull-cap with a chin-strap and a point of olive wood on its top, like a spindle, with a little fluff of wool at the base of the spindle. This was the traditional outfit during a ritual or sacrifice performed by the &quot;flamen&quot;. The &quot;flamen&quot; would not wear the &quot;laena&quot; on a daily occurrence. The &quot;flamen&quot; would also wear special shoes known as &quot;calcei&quot;. The &quot;flamen&quot; dress represented status. Only &quot;flamines&quot; were able to wear such a costume. It separated them from average citizens, politicians, and military figures. The responsibility for the creation of such a costume fell in the hands of the &quot;flaminica&quot;. The costume was handmade and a ritual blade known as &quot;secespikta&quot; was used in the process. The &quot;laena&quot; had to be made of wool, because wool was seen as pure and the most appropriate clothing to serve the gods.

== Duties and obligations ==
The &quot;flamen&quot; and the &quot;flaminica&quot; had special roles that could not be done by the other. This position in Roman society was held to a specific standard with strict rules. The &quot;flamen&quot; could not perform the duties of the &quot;flaminica&quot; and she could not perform the duties of her husband. One example would be the honour killing and sacrifice of a ram, which was known as an offering to Jupiter and could only be done by the &quot;flaminica&quot; on market days. The &quot;flamen&quot; couldn&#x27;t perform his sacred duties without the &quot;flaminica&quot;. These positions of serving the gods were meant to be served together as husband and wife. This was a partnership where each person was dependent on the other. This is why, when one died, the other would have to step down, because they were not allowed to replace their partner or continue by themselves.

==Flamines maiores==
The three were required to be patricians:
*The oversaw the cult of Jupiter, the sky deity and ruler of the gods.
*The oversaw the cult of Mars, the god of war, leading public on the days sacred to Mars. The sacred spears of Mars were ritually shaken by the &quot;Flamen Martialis&quot; when the legions were preparing for war.
*The oversaw the cult of Quirinus, who presided over organized Roman social life and was related to the peaceful aspect of Mars. The &quot;Flamen Quirinalis&quot; led public on the days sacred to Quirinus.

A fourth was dedicated to Julius Caesar as a divinity () of the Roman state. Thereafter, any deceased emperor could be made &quot;divus&quot; by vote of the senate and consent of his successor, and as a &quot;divus&quot; he would be served by a flamen. The &quot;flamen&quot;&#x27;s role in relation to living emperors is uncertain; no living emperor is known to have received official divine worship; see Imperial cult.

A &quot;flamen&quot; could also be represented by a , or by a member without that title who could act as a substitute for the &quot;flamen&quot; (&quot;qui vice flaminis fungebatur&quot;).

== Flamines minores ==
The twelve could be plebeians. Some of the deities whose cult they tended were rather obscure, and only ten are known by name:

* , the flamen for Carmentis
* , for Ceres
* , for Falacer
* , for Flora
* , for Furrina
* , for Palatua
* , for Pomona
* , for Portunus
* , for Vulcan
* , for Volturnus

There were two other during the Republican period, but the names of the deities they cultivated are unknown. The &quot;flamines minores&quot; seem mostly connected to agriculture or local cults. The change to an urban way of life may explain why these deities lost their importance or fell into oblivion.

The and are not recorded in calendars as their festivals were moveable. Some information exists for the ritual roles of the in connection with the cult of the god Quirinus and in connexion with the cult of the goddess Maia on the Kalends of May. Also preserved is the list of deities invoked by the when he officiated at sacrifices to the goddesses Ceres and Tellus.

Scholars disagree about some differences among and . Some maintain the difference was not substantial. Others, among them Dumézil, believe that inherent differences lay in the right of the &quot;auspicia maiora&quot; and the ritual of inauguration that concerned only the by birth as , that is, as children of parents married through the ritual of &quot;confarreatio&quot;, which was the form of marriage in turn required for . The also had the privilege of having , assistants who carried out day-to-day business. The difference would thus be akin to that between magistracies with and those with only.

<doc id="347424" wikidata="Q276692" url="?curid=347424" title="Hajime Sorayama">
<text>is a Japanese illustrator known, along for his design work on the original Sony AIBO, for his precisely detailed, erotic portrayals of feminine robots. He describes his highly detailed style as &quot;superrealism&quot;, which he says &quot;deals with the technical issue of how close one can get to one&#x27;s object.&quot;

Modern English-language editions of Sorayama&#x27;s art books give his name as &quot;Hajime Sorayama&quot;, using conventional Western order, with given name followed by surname. Some older publications give his name as &quot;Sorayama Hajime&quot;, using native Japanese name order, which puts the family name first.

==Early life==
Hajime Sorayama was born in 1947 in Imabari, Ehime prefecture, Japan. He received his basic education at Imabari Kita High School where he began drawing Playboy inspired pin-ups. He was influenced by Makoto Oda&#x27;s book &quot;Nandemo Mite yaro (&quot;I&#x27;ll go and see everything&quot;)&quot; about his travels through Europe and Asia; Sorayama took interest in Greece and decided to enter Christian Shikoku Gakuin University to study English literature and Ancient Greek. In his second year, he founded the school magazine, &quot;Pink Journal&quot;, but criticism motivated him to leave for Tokyo&#x27;s Chuo Art School in 1967 to study art.

Sorayama graduated in 1968 at the age of 21, and gained an appointment in an advertising agency. He became a freelance illustrator in 1972. In 1978, he drew his first robot. Of this subject, he wrote: &quot;A friend of mine, the designer Hara Koichi, wanted to use C-3PO from &quot;Star Wars&quot; for a Suntory poster presentation. But time was short and there were problems with copyright fee[s], so I was asked to come up with something.&quot;

==Career==
Sorayama is known for his fine art, illustration, and industrial design. Of the distinction between the first two, Soryama commented in an interview: &quot;Unlike art, illustration is not a matter of emotion or hatreds, but an experience that comes naturally through logical thinking.&quot;

Sorayama began drawing erotic art of gynoid robots in 1983. His pin-up work appeared monthly for years in the pages of &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine, and Playboy TV later aired made a television special on Sorayama&#x27;s art. In an interview, he said pin-up was his &quot;mania&quot;, commenting that &quot;I&#x27;ve been drawing them since high school. Back then, there was this thing for the Playboy and Penthouse playmates. Now, it&#x27;s the girl-next-door, idol type, but in our day, these pin-ups were like goddesses. I guess I could describe it as my own goddess cult.&quot;

His style has influenced other works such as the 2015 film &quot;Ex Machina&quot;.

In the 2000s, Sorayama&#x27;s first-generation AIBO design (the robotics of which were developed by Sony&#x27;s Toshitada Doi) received the Grand Prize of Best Design award, the highest design award conferred by Japan. AIBO has since been included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) and the Smithsonian Institution. It was included in the book &quot;Objects of Design&quot; by Paola Antonelli and has been the subject of special studies at Carnegie Mellon University. The Nike &quot;White Dunk Project&quot; included Sorayama among the 25 most inspiring Japanese artists.

The artist released another retrospective, &quot;Master Works&quot;, in early 2010, and a new book, &quot;Vibrant Vixens&quot;, in May 2013 and updated version &quot;XL Masterworks&quot; in 2014. He worked with filmmakers in Hollywood on fantasy and science fiction projects, including a film about &quot;Penthouse&quot;. During 2012 and 2013, Sorayama collaborated with American fashion designer Marc Ecko. In 2013 Sorayama was a contributor to the art book &quot;Star Wars Art Concept&quot;.

In 2016, South Korean fashion label Juun.J released a series of garments in collaboration with Sorayama. French fashion brand Dior collaborated with Sorayama for their Pre-Fall 2019 menswear collection. The collection was a commercial and critical hit, and Sorayama worked with Dior on a follow-up Summer capsule collection.

<text>The National Baptist Evangelical Life and Soul Saving Assembly of the United States of America (NBELSSA) is an African-American missions body first formed as an auxiliary of the National Baptist Convention of America, Inc. This body was founded in 1920 in Kansas City, Missouri by Captain Allan Arthur Banks, Sr. The NBELSSA operated within the NBC of America until 1936 or 1937, when it became an independent group. The main emphasis of the NBELSSA was in evangelism (including charity &amp; relief work) and education (especially its Bible correspondence school). In 1952 this Assembly claimed 644 churches and was headquartered in Boise, Idaho. Many of these churches were evidently dually affiliated with other National Baptist conventions. More recently, the NBELSSA was headquartered at the Second Baptist Church of Detroit, Michigan, and was still operating a correspondence school.

<text>The Elsbett, or Elko (known for &quot;Elsbett Konstruktion&quot;), engine is an 89 horsepower (66 Kilowatt), direct-injection diesel engine that was invented by Ludwig Elsbett It is designed to run on pure plant oil (PVO). Elsbett AG, the current manufactuerer, is based in Thalmässing, Bavaria. 

The design limits of the loss of energy as heat by a variety of technologies: 
* The fuel charge is injected in such a manner as to &quot;blend perfectly with the air&quot; and combust within a central core of hot air, not contacting the chamber walls. 
* The engine also doesn&#x27;t use any water cooling. Instead, oil is used as the singular coolant.

<text>The French Grand Prix (), formerly known as the Grand Prix de l&#x27;ACF (Automobile Club de France), is an auto race held as part of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s annual Formula One World Championship. It is one of the oldest motor races in the world as well as the first &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. It ceased, shortly after its centenary, in with 86 races having been held, due to unfavourable financial circumstances and venues. The race returned to the Formula One calendar in with Circuit Paul Ricard hosting the race, but was removed from the calendar after .

Unusually even for a race of such longevity, the location of the Grand Prix has moved frequently with 16 different venues having been used over its life, a number only eclipsed by the 23 venues used for the Australian Grand Prix since its 1928 start. It is also one of four races (along with the Belgian, Italian and Spanish Grands Prix) to have been held as part of the three distinct Grand Prix championships (the World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship in the late 1920s, the European Championship in the 1930s and the Formula One World Championship since 1950).

The Grand Prix de l&#x27;ACF was tremendously influential in the early years of Grand Prix racing, leading the establishment of the rules and regulations of racing as well as setting trends in the evolution of racing. The power of the original organiser, the Automobile Club de France, established France as the home of motor racing organisation.

==History==
===Origins===
France was one of the first countries to hold motor racing events of any kind. The first competitive motor race, the Paris to Rouen Horseless Carriages Contest was held on 22 July 1894, and was organized by the Automobile Club de France (ACF). The race was 126 km (78 mi) long and was won by Count Jules-Albert de Dion in his De Dion Bouton steam powered car in just under 7 hours. This race was followed by races starting in Paris to various towns and cities around France such as Bordeaux, Marseille, Lyon and Dieppe, and also to various other European cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin, Innsbruck and Vienna. The 1901 Paris-Berlin race was noteworthy as the race winner, Henri Fournier averaged an astonishing 57 mph (93 km/h) in his Mors, but there were details of other incidents. A competitor driving a 40H.P. Panhard suddenly found the road blocked by a tram in the village of Metternich, and he deliberately ran into the vehicle to avoid the crowd of spectators. The tram was knocked off the rails; the car was hardly damaged. And in Reims, a future location of many French Grands Prix, another competitor in a Mors hit and killed a child who wandered onto the road.

But these races, held on public dirt roads that were not all closed to the public came to a halt in 1903. The Paris-Madrid race, a 1,307 km (812 mi) long competition from the French capital to the Spanish capital held in May of that year had over 300 entrants. Some of the cars were doing 140 km/h (87 mph)- an astonishingly fast speed for the time- not even rail locomotives were capable of hitting these speeds. It was not known at the time how safe these races would be or how these cars- made mostly of wood would perform, and development of the car had improved significantly over 9 years. The race was a disaster, with 8 people killed and over 15 injured in multiple accidents- and all of this happened before any of the competitors reached the Spanish border. Crowds of onlookers would stand right on the edge of the track, and children were wandering into the roads which became very dusty, and visibility was limited at best. The most notable fatality of this race was one Marcel Renault, one of the 3 brothers who founded the Renault car company, a manufacturer that would go on to have lots of success in Grand Prix racing many decades later and be a huge influence on French motorsport. When Renault reached the village of Payré just south of Grand Poitiers he lost control of his 16HP Renault in poor visibility caused by excess dust. The car went into a gutter and crashed into a tree, and Renault sustained a horrific wound in the side of his head and dislocated his shoulder. Fellow competitor Leon Théry stopped his Decauville in order to help Renault and his riding-mechanic Vauthier, still trapped in their car. No doctors were on hand, but Théry found one at the next village and sent him to the place of accident- the doctor rode a bicycle to get to the accident. The doctor conveyed Renault back to the nearest hospital in Grand Poitiers, where Renault succumbed to his injuries two days later, while Vauthier survived with minor injuries. Accidents continued throughout the day; cars hit trees and disintegrated, they overturned and caught fire, axles broke and inexperienced drivers crashed on the rough roads. The race was eventually called off by the French government and there was no declared winner. The cars were impounded by the French authorities, towed to the nearest rail stations by horses and transported back to Paris by train. The race created a political uproar in France, and a French magazine did their own investigation into the race. Speed, dust created by the cars, poor organization and lack of crowd control were to blame for these tragedies and even French Prime Minister Émile Combes was held partially responsible because he was the ultimate authority on allowing the race to proceed.

Other races were organized by American newspaper publisher James Gordon Bennett called the Gordon Bennett Cup, 4 of which were in France. 3 city-to-city races in 1900, 1901 and 1902, all starting in Paris were organized by Bennett and they attracted top racers from the United States and Western Europe. But after the 1903 Paris-Madrid race, the French government banned point-to-point car races on open public roads, so Bennett moved the 1903 race to Ireland on a closed circuit 2 months after Paris-Madrid, the first of its kind. This race was won by Belgian Camille Jenatzy in a Mercedes, who was one of the bravest and most fearless racing drivers of his time. The 1904 race was held in western Germany while the last Gordon Bennett Cup race was held in an 137 km (85 mi) circuit in Auvergne in south-central France. The race started in Clermont-Ferrand, and was run over 4 laps, and was won by Théry in a Brasier.

===The world&#x27;s oldest Grand Prix===
====Closed public road courses====
The French &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, open to international competition was first run on 26 June 1906 under the auspices of the Automobile Club de France in Sarthe with a starting field of 32 automobiles. The Grand Prix name (&quot;Great Prize&quot;) referred to the prize of 45,000 French francs to the race winner. The franc was pegged to gold at 0.290 grams per franc, which meant that the prize was worth 13kg of gold, or US$210,700 adjusted for inflation. The earliest French Grands Prix were held on circuits consisting of public roads near towns through northern and central France, and they usually were held at different towns each year, such as Le Mans, Dieppe, Amiens, Lyon, Strasbourg, and Tours. Dieppe in particular was an extremely dangerous circuit – 9 people (5 drivers, 2 riding mechanics, and 2 spectators) in total were killed at the three French Grands Prix held at the 79km (49-mile) circuit.

The 1906 race was the first ever national race named &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; mention appeared in France in 1900 as a sub-category name for entries for the Circuit du Sud-Ouest in Pau, where the word &quot;Grand Prix&quot; was initially used for horse racing competitions, the name Grand Prix was then used to describe the whole race in 1901); other, later, international events in the 1900s and 1910s in Europe and the United States had their own names with the term &quot;Prize&quot; in them, such as &quot;Grand Prize&quot; in America or &quot;Kaiserpreis&quot; (English: Emperor&#x27;s Prize) in Germany. The French Grand Prix race was run on a very fast 66-mile (106km) one-off anti-clockwise closed public road circuit east of the small western French city of Le Mans, starting in the village of Saint-Mars-la-Briere. It then went down the Route D323 and turned a hard left onto Route D357 near the commune of Yvre-l-Eveque onto a 4-mile straight towards the village of La Butte, then down a 15-mile straight through Bouloire and then into a twisty section in Saint-Calais. The circuit then went north on Route D1 through Berfay and then entered a purpose-built twisty section made of wooden logging track in a forest before Vibraye and then went north again, entering a series of fast corners in and near Lamnay, and then turned west at La Ferte-Bernard. The circuit then went down Route D323 again and down multiple straights 3 to 6 miles long with a few fast corners at Sceaux-sur-Huisne and Conerre, before returning to the pits at Saint-Mars-la-Briere. Circuits in Europe that went through multiple rural towns like this one became ever more common on public road circuits in France and other European countries. Long straights also became a staple of circuits in France, particularly at future iterations of the relocated Sarthe circuit at Le Mans- a city that would host another race that would become a fixed staple in motor racing circles. The Hungarian Ferenc Szisz won this very long 12hour race on a Renault from Italian Felice Nazzaro in a Fiat, where laps on this circuit took just under an hour and the horse carriage road surface was made of dirt; even so this did not stop the fastest lap average speed being 73.37 mph (118.09 km/h)- an astonishingly fast speed for the time. The 1908 race saw Mercedes humiliating the French organizers and finishing 1-2-3 at the lethal circuit at Dieppe, where no less than 4 people were killed during the weekend. The 1913 race was won by Georges Boillot on a one-off 19-mile (31km) circuit near Amiens in northern France. Amiens was another deadly circuit – it had a 7.1 mile straight and 5 people were killed during its use during pre-race testing and the race weekend itself.

The 1914 race, run on a 23mile circuit near Lyon is perhaps the most legendary and dramatic Grand Prix of the preWWI racing era. This circuit, which was popular with drivers and spectators had a twisty and demanding section down to the town of Le Madeline and then an 8.3 mile straight interrupted by a hairpin which returned to the pits. This race was a hard-fought battle between the French Peugeots and the German Mercedes. Although the Peugeots were fast and Boillot ended up leading for 12 of the 20 laps after Max Sailer in a Mercedes unexpectedly dropped out with engine failure on Lap 6, the Dunlop tyres they used wore out badly compared to the Continentials that the Mercedes cars were using. Boillot&#x27;s four-minute lead was wiped out by Christian Lautenschlager in a Mercedes while Boillot stopped an incredible eight times for tyres. Although Boillot drove very hard to try to catch Lautenschlager, he had to retire on the last lap due to engine failure, and for the second time in 6 years Mercedes finished 1–2–3; a humiliating result for the organizers and Peugeot.

Because of World War I and the amount of damage it did to France, the Grand Prix was not brought back until 1921, and that race was won by American Jimmy Murphy with a Duesenberg at the Sarthe circuit at Le Mans, which was the now legendary circuit&#x27;s first year of operation. Bugatti made its debut at the 1922 race at an 8.3mile (13km) one-off public road circuit near Strasbourg near the French-German border – which was very close to Bugatti&#x27;s headquarters in Molsheim. It rained, and the muddy semi-rectangular circuit, made up of long straights, 90 degree corners, a fast kink and a hairpin was in a dreadful condition. This race became a duel between Bugatti and Fiat – and Felice Nazzaro won in a Fiat, although his nephew and fellow competitor Biagio Nazzaro was killed after the axle on his Fiat broke, threw a wheel and hit a tree; the 32-year old and his riding mechanic both suffered fatal head injuries. The 1923 race at another one-off circuit near Tours featured another new Bugatti – the Type 32. This car was insultingly dubbed the &quot;Tank&quot;, owing to its streamlined shape and very short wheelbase. This car was quick on the long straights of this very fast 14 mile (23 km) public road circuit – but it handled badly and was outpaced by Briton Henry Segrave in a supercharged Sunbeam, supercharging being a common feature of Grand Prix cars during this period. Segrave won the race, and the Sunbeam would be the last British car to win an official Grand Prix until Stirling Moss&#x27;s victory with a Vanwall at the 1957 British Grand Prix. Segrave, a known teetotaler was given a glass of champagne after his victory, because apparently there wasn&#x27;t any water available in the pits area. The 1924 race was held again at Lyon, but this time on a shortened 14mile variant of the circuit used in 1914. Two of the most successful Grand Prix cars of all time, the Bugatti Type 35 and the Alfa Romeo P2 both made their debuts at this race. The Bugattis, with their advanced alloy wheels suffered tyre failure, and Italian Giuseppe Campari won in his Alfa P2.

====France&#x27;s first permanent circuit and other public road circuits====

In 1925, the first permanent autodrome in France was built, it was called Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry, located 20 miles south of the centre of Paris. The 7.7mile (12.3km) circuit included a 51degree concrete banking, an asphalt road course and then-modern facilities, including pit garages and grandstands. Purpose-built autodromes like Montlhéry were often built near the country&#x27;s largest cities (with the exception of Indianapolis and the Nürburgring). After the construction of Brooklands near London in England in 1907, and Indianapolis in the United States in 1908 and after World War I, Monza near Milan in Italy was opened in 1922, and Sitges–Terramar near Barcelona in Spain was also opened in 1923. The French were then prompted to construct a purpose-built racing circuit at Montlhéry in the north and then Miramas in the south. The Nürburgring in western Germany followed in 1927, to complement eastern Germany&#x27;s AVUS street circuit. Montlhery first held the Grand Prix de l&#x27;ACF in 1925 as part of the inaugural World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, the first time Grands Prix were grouped together to form a championship. The circuit drew huge crowds and they were witnesses to the spectacular sight of fast cars racing on Montlhéry&#x27;s steep banking and asphalt road course, which had many fast corners and long straights, and was located in a forest. The first race at Montlhéry was marred by the fatal accident of Antonio Ascari in an Alfa P2, when he crashed at a very fast left-hand kink returning to the oval portion. Miramas, a high-banked concrete oval track like Brooklands and part of Montlhéry was completed in 1926, and it played host to the Grand Prix that year. This race saw only three cars compete, all Bugattis, and was won by Frenchman Jules Goux, who had also won the Indianapolis 500 in 1913.

The 1927 race at Montlhéry was won by Frenchman Robert Benoist in a Delage. 1929 saw a brief return to Le Mans, which was won by William Grover-Williams in a Bugatti; this was the man who had won the first ever Monaco Grand Prix earlier in the year; Grover-Williams had also won the 1928 race in a Bugatti at the 17-mile (28 km) Saint-Gaudens circuit in the south, not far from Toulouse. The 1930 French Grand Prix, held at Pau back down in the south was one of the more memorable French Grands Prix of the pre-World War II period. This race, held in September on a one-off triangular 9.8mile (15.8-km) public road circuit just a few kilometres away from the current Pau Grand Prix track saw a special supercharged version of the famous Bentley 4½ Litre called the Blower Bentley compete in the race with Briton and &quot;Bentley Boy&quot; Tim Birkin driving. The Bentley team had been dominating the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and this Blower Bentley had its headlights and mudguards removed, as these were not needed for this race, giving it the appearance of an open-wheel car. The Bentley, which was much larger and heavier than the small Bugattis around it performed well – at this very fast circuit which was made up of very long straights and tight hairpins actually suited the powerful Blower Bentley, and it enabled Birkin to pass the pits at 130 mph (208 km/h) (very fast for that time), and he overtook car after car – to the amazement of the crowd. But he finished second to Frenchman Philippe Étancelin in a Bugatti.

Montlhéry would also be part of the second Grand Prix championship era; the European Championship when it began in 1931. Other public road circuits also played host to French Grand Prix, such as the fast, straight and slow corner-dominated 4.8mile Reims-Gueux circuit in the Champagne wine region of Northern France 144km (90mi) east of Paris for 1932, where Italian legend Tazio Nuvolari won in an Alfa Romeo. But from 1933 to 1937 Montlhéry would become the sole host of the event. The 1934 French Grand Prix marked the return of Mercedes-Benz to Grand Prix racing after 20 years, with an all-new car, team, management, and drivers, headed by Alfred Neubauer. 1934 was the year where the German Silver Arrows debuted (an effort heavily funded by Hitler&#x27;s Third Reich), with Auto Union having already debuted its powerful mid-engined Type–A car for a race at AVUS in Germany. Although the Monégasque driver Louis Chiron won in an Alfa, the Silver Arrows dominated the race. The high-tech German cars seemed to float over the rough concrete banking at Montlhéry where all the other cars seemed to be visibly affected by the concrete surface. Makeshift chicanes were placed at certain points on the high-speed circuit in an effort by the French to slow the very fast German cars down for the 1935 race, but this effort came to nothing as Mercedes superstar Rudolf Caracciola won that year&#x27;s race.

====Reims, Rouen and Charade====

The French Grand Prix returned to the Reims-Gueux circuit for 1938 and 1939, where the Silver Arrows continued their domination of Grand Prix racing. The Reims-Gueux circuit had its straights widened and facilities updated for the 1938 race. It was around this time that the French Grand Prix had some of its prestige transferred after 2 years of being a sportscar race- the Monaco Grand Prix had gained a huge amount of prestige and would become the premier French-related Grand Prix event, taking place in a tiny principality surrounded by France; but the French Grand Prix was still an important race now held traditionally on the first weekend of July. But when World War II began, the French Grand Prix did not come back until 1947, where it was held at the one-time Parilly circuit near Lyon, a race that was marred by an accident involving Pierre Levegh crashing into and killing 3 spectators. After that, Grand Prix racing returned to Reims-Gueux, where another manufacturer – Alfa Romeo – would dominate the event for 4 years. 1950 was the first year of the Formula One World Championship, but all the Formula One-regulated races were held in Europe. The race was won by Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio, who also won the next year&#x27;s race – the longest Formula One race ever held in terms of distance covered, totalling 373 miles.

The prestigious French event was held for the first time at the Rouen-Les-Essarts public road circuit in 1952, where it would be held four more times over the next 16 years. Rouen was a very high speed circuit located in the northern part of the country, that was made up mostly of high speed bends. But the race returned to Reims in 1953, where the triangular circuit, which was originally made up of three long straights (with a few slight kinks) two tight 90 degree right hand corners and a very slow right hand hairpin had been modified to bypass the town of Gueux, making what was already regarded as a very fast circuit even faster. Reims now had two straights (including the even longer back straight), three very fast bends and two very slow and tight hairpins. This race was a classic, with Fangio in a Maserati and Briton Mike Hawthorn in a Ferrari having a race-long battle for the lead, with Hawthorn taking the checkered flag. 1954 was another special event, and this marked Mercedes&#x27;s return to top-flight road racing led by Alfred Neubauer, 20 years after their first return to Grand Prix racing – in France. After two wins for the works Maserati team that year at Buenos Aires and Spa, Fangio was now driving for Mercedes and he and teammate Karl Kling effectively dominated the race from start to finish with their advanced W196&#x27;s. It was not a popular win – Mercedes, a German car manufacturer, had won on French soil – only 9 years after the German occupation of France had ended. The French Grand Prix was cancelled in 1955 because of the Le Mans disaster, and Mercedes withdrew from all racing at the end of that year. The race continued to be held at Reims in 1956, another spell at a lengthened Rouen-Les-Essarts in 1957 and back to Reims again from 1958 to 1961, 1963 and one last event in 1966 at this circuit, located where champagne is made. The 1956 race saw a one-off appearance by Bugatti- they entered a new mid-engined Grand Prix car (which was a novelty at the time, and only the second Grand Prix car ever to be designed this way after the 1930s Auto Unions) designed by renowned Italian engineer Colombo and driven by Maurice Trintignant, but the car was underpowered, overweight, and over-complicated, and it proved to be very difficult to drive; it retired early in the race. The 1958 race was marred by the fatal accident of Italian Luigi Musso, driving a works Ferrari, and it was also Fangio&#x27;s last Formula One race. Hawthorn, who like many other F1 drivers at the time, held Fangio in very high regard; and was about to lap Fangio (driving in an outdated Maserati) on the last lap on the pit straight when he slowed down and let Fangio cross the line before him so the respected Argentine driver could complete the whole race distance. Hawthorn won, and Fangio finished fourth. 1961 saw the race being held in weather, and the track broke up at the hairpins. The race came down to a slipstreaming battle between American Dan Gurney in a Porsche and Italian Giancarlo Baghetti in the sharknose Ferrari. Baghetti won the race- which astonishingly was his first ever championship Grand Prix by less than a car&#x27;s length from Gurney.

Rouen-Les-Essarts hosted the event in 1962 and 1964, and Gurney won both these events, one in a Porsche and another in a Brabham. In 1965 the race was held at the 5.1 mile Charade Circuit in the hills surrounding Michelin&#x27;s hometown of Clermont-Ferrand in central France. Unlike the long straights that made up Reims and the fast curves that made up Rouen, Charade was known as a mini-Nürburgring and was twisty, undulating and very demanding. In 1966, 34 years after first hosting this prestigious event Reims staged its last French Grand Prix, with Australian Jack Brabham winning in a car bearing his name. The short Bugatti Circuit at Le Mans held the race in 1967, but the circuit was not liked by the Formula One circus, and it never returned. Rouen-Les-Essarts hosted the event in 1968, and it was a disastrous event; Frenchman Jo Schlesser crashed and was killed at the very fast &quot;Six Frères&quot; corner in his burning Honda, and Formula One did not return to the public-road circuit. Charade hosted two more events, and then Formula One moved to the newly built, modern Circuit Paul Ricard on the French riviera for 1971. Paul Ricard Circuit, located in Le Castellet, just outside Marseille and not far from Monaco, was a new type of modern facility, much like Montlhéry had been in the 1920s. It had run-off areas, a wide track and ample viewing areas for spectators. Charade hosted the event one last time in 1972; Formula One cars had become too fast for public road circuits; the circuit was littered with rocks and Austrian Helmut Marko was hit in the eye by a rock thrown up from Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi&#x27;s Lotus which ended his racing career.

====Le Castellet and Dijon-Prenois====
Formula One returned to Paul Ricard in 1973; the French Grand Prix was never run on public road circuits like Reims, Rouen and Charade ever again. Paul Ricard circuit also had a driving school, the École de Pilotage Winfield, run by the Knight brothers and Simon Delatour, that honed the talents of people such as France&#x27;s first (and so far only) Formula One World Champion Alain Prost, and Grand Prix winners Didier Pironi and Jacques Laffite. The event was run at the new fast, up-and-down Prenois circuit near Dijon in 1974, before returning to Ricard in 1975 and 1976. The race was originally scheduled to be run at Clermont-Ferrand for 1974 and 1975, but the circuit was deemed too dangerous for Formula One. The two venues alternated the venue until 1984, with Ricard getting the race in even-numbered years and Dijon in odd-numbered years (except 1983). 1977 saw a new part of the Dijon circuit built called the &quot;Parabolique&quot;. This was done to increase lap times which had been very nearly below a minute in 1974, and the race featured a battle between American Mario Andretti and Briton John Watson; Andretti came out on top to win. Lotus teammates Andretti and Swede Ronnie Peterson dominated the race in 1978 with their dominant 79s, a car that dominated the field in a way not seen since the dominating Alfa Romeo and domineering Ferrari in the early 1950s. The 1979 race was another classic, with the famous end-of-race duel for second place between Frenchman René Arnoux in a 1.5-liter turbocharged V6 Renault and Canadian Gilles Villeneuve in a 3-liter Flat-12 Ferrari. It is considered to be one of the all-time great duels in motorsports, with Arnoux and Villeneuve banging wheels and cars around the fast Dijon circuit before Villeneuve came out on top. The race was won by Arnoux&#x27;s French teammate Jean-Pierre Jabouille, which was the first race ever won by a Formula One car with a turbo-charged engine. 1980 saw rookie Prost qualify his slower McLaren seventh and Australian Alan Jones beat French Ligier drivers Laffite and Pironi on their home soil, and the 1981 race was the first of 51 victories by future 4-time world champion Prost; driving a Renault, the French marque won the next three French Grands Prix. The 1982 event at Ricard was a memorable one for France – it was a turbo-charged engine/French walkover and 4 French drivers finished in the top 4 positions – each of them driving a car with a turbo-charged engine. Renault driver René Arnoux won from his teammate Prost and Ferrari drivers Pironi and Patrick Tambay finished 3rd and 4th. But this French triumph was internally sour: Arnoux violated an agreement that if he was in front of Prost, he would let him by because Prost was better placed in the championship. Much to the chagrin of Prost and the French Renault team&#x27;s management Arnoux did not do this, despite the management holding out pit boards ordering him to let Prost past. Prost won the next year at the same place, beating out Nelson Piquet in a Brabham with a turbocharged BMW engine; Piquet had led the previous year&#x27;s race but retired with engine failure.

Dijon was last used in 1984, and by then turbo-charged engines were almost ubiquitous, save the Tyrrell team who were still using the Cosworth V8 engine. The international motorsports governing body at the time, FISA, had instituted a policy of long-term contracts with only one circuit per Grand Prix. The choice was between Dijon and Ricard – the small Prenois circuit had cars lapping in the 1 minute 1 second range, and Ricard was the main testing facility for Formula One at the time. So it was Ricard that was chosen, and it hosted the race from 1985 to 1990. From 1986 onwards Formula One used a shortened version of the circuit, after Elio de Angelis&#x27;s fatal crash at the fast Verriere bends. De Angelis was not injured by the crash, however his car caught fire and there were no marshals to help him as it was a test session, and he died of smoke inhalation in hospital the next day. These two fast corners and the whole top section of the circuit was not used for the last five races. Prost won the final three races there, the 1988 one being a particularly dramatic win; he overtook his teammate Ayrton Senna at the Curbe de Signes at the end of the ultra fast Mistral Straight and held onto the lead all the way to the finish, and the 1990 (by which time turbo-charged engines had been banned) event was led for more than 60 laps by Italian Ivan Capelli and Brazilian Maurício Gugelmin in underfunded, Adrian Newey designed Leyton-House cars – two cars that had failed to qualify at the previous event in Mexico. Prost, now driving for Ferrari after driving for McLaren from 1984 to 1989, made a late-race charge and passed Capelli to take the victory; Gugelmin had retired earlier.

====Magny-Cours====

In 1991, the race moved to the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours, where it stayed for another 17 years. Magny-Cours was the seventh venue to host the French Grand Prix as a part of the Formula One World Championship, and the sixteenth in total. The move to Magny-Cours was an attempt to stimulate the economy of the area, but many within Formula One complained about the remote nature of the circuit. Highlights of Magny-Cours&#x27;s time hosting the French Grand Prix include Prost&#x27;s final of six wins on home soil in 1993, and Michael Schumacher&#x27;s securing of the 2002 championship after only 11 races. The 2004 and 2005 races were in doubt because of financial problems and the addition of new circuits to the Formula One calendar. These races went ahead as planned, but it still had an uncertain future.

In 2007 it was announced by the FFSA, the race promoter, that the 2008 French Grand Prix was put on an indefinite &quot;pause&quot;. This suspension was due to the financial situation of the circuit, known to be disliked by many in F1 due to the circuit&#x27;s location. Then Bernie Ecclestone confirmed (at the time) that the 2007 French Grand Prix would be the last to be held at Magny-Cours. This turned out not to be true, because funding for the 2008 race was found, and this race at Magny-Cours was the last French Grand Prix for 10 years.

===Absence===

After various negotiations, the future of the race at Magny-Cours took another turn, with increased speculation that the 2008 French Grand Prix would return, with Ecclestone himself stating &quot;We&#x27;re going to maybe resurrect it for a year, or something like that&quot;. On 24 July, Ecclestone and the French Prime Minister met and agreed to possibly maintain the race at Magny Cours for 2008 and 2009. The change in fortune was completed on July, when the FIA published the calendar with a 2008 French Grand Prix scheduled at Magny-Cours once again. The 2009 race, however, was again cancelled on 15 October 2008, with the official website citing &quot;economic reasons&quot;. A huge makeover of Magny-Cours (&quot;2.0&quot;) was planned, but cancelled in the end. The race&#x27;s promoter FFSA then started looking for an alternative host. There were five different proposals for a new circuit: in Rouen with 3 possible layouts (a street circuit, in the dock area, or a permanent circuit near the airport), a street circuit located near Disneyland Resort Paris, Versailles, and in Sarcelles (&quot;Val de France&quot;), but all were cancelled. A final location in Flins-Les Mureaux, near the Flins Renault Factory was being considered however that was cancelled as well on 1 December 2009. In 2010 and 2011, there was no French Grand Prix on the Formula 1 calendar, although the Circuit Paul Ricard was a candidate for 2012.

10 French drivers have won the French Grand Prix; 7 before World War I and II and 3 during the Formula One championship. French driver Alain Prost won the race six times at three different circuits; however German driver Michael Schumacher has won eight times – the joint most anybody has ever won any Grand Prix (Lewis Hamilton has since won the British and Hungarian Grands Prix eight times). Monégasque driver Louis Chiron won it five times, and the Argentine driver Juan Manuel Fangio and British driver Nigel Mansell both won four times.

===Return to Le Castellet===
In December 2016, it was confirmed that the French Grand Prix would return in 2018 at the Circuit Paul Ricard and it held a contract to host the French Grand Prix until 2022.
In an announcement to the nation on 13 April 2020, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said that restrictions on public events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic would continue until mid-July, putting the 2020 French Grand Prix, scheduled for 28 June, at risk of postponement. The race was later cancelled with no intention to reschedule for the 2020 championship. The race returned for the 2021 season.

The promoters of the French Grand Prix confirmed that the race was not going to be on the 2023 calendar, stating that they aim for a rotational race deal, sharing its slot with other Grands Prix.

===Races sometimes considered to be French Grand Prix===
Beginning in the early 1920s, French media represented eight races held in France before 1906 as being Grands Prix de l&#x27;Automobile Club de France, leading to the first French Grand Prix being known as the ninth Grand Prix de l&#x27;ACF. This was done to give the Grand Prix the appearance of being the world&#x27;s oldest motor race. The winners of these races, along with their original titles, are listed here.

<text>Podolia or Podillia is a historic region in Eastern Europe, located in the west-central and south-western parts of Ukraine and in northeastern Moldova (i.e. northern Transnistria).

Podolia is bordered by the Dniester River and the Eastern Bug River. Covering an area of , it features an elongated plateau and fertile agricultural land. Its main rivers are the Dniester and the Southern Bug, which serve as important trade channels. Podolia is known for its cherries, mulberries, melons, gourds, and cucumbers.

The region has a rich history, dating back to the Neolithic period, with various tribes and civilizations occupying it over time. It became part of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, the Golden Horde, the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Ottoman Empire, the Austrian Habsburg monarchy, and the Russian Empire. In the 20th century, Podolia underwent various political changes, with both Poland and the Soviet Union controlling parts of it at different times.

Podolian culture is renowned for its folk icon-painting tradition, with red, green, and yellow colors dominating the art. Collections of these iconic works can be found in the Vinnytsya Art Museum and the Museum of Ukrainian Home Icons in Radomysl Castle.

==Etymology==

The name derives from Proto-Slavic &quot;*po&quot; and &quot;*dolъ&quot; (cf. English dale, German &quot;Tal&quot;).

==Geography==

The area is part of the vast East European Plain, confined by the Dniester River and the Carpathian arc in the southwest. It comprises an area of about , extending for from northwest to southeast on the left bank of the Dniester. In the same direction run two ranges of relatively low hills, separated by the Southern Bug. The Podolian Upland, an elongated, up to high plateau stretches from the Western and Southern Bug rivers to the Dniester, and includes mountainous regions with canyon-like fluvial valleys.

Podolia lies east of historic Red Ruthenia, i.e. the eastern half of Galicia, beyond the Seret River, a tributary of the Dniester. In the northwest, it borders on Volhynia. It is largely made up of the present-day Ukrainian Vinnytsia Oblast and southern and central Khmelnytskyi Oblast. The Podolian lands also include parts of the adjacent Ternopil Oblast in the west and Kyiv Oblast in the northeast. In the east it consists of the neighbouring parts of Cherkasy, Kirovohrad and Odesa Oblasts, as well as the northern half of Transnistria.

Two large rivers, with numerous tributaries, drain the region: the Dniester, which forms its boundary with Moldova and is navigable throughout its length, and the Southern Bug, which flows almost parallel to the former in a higher, sometimes swampy, valley, interrupted in several places by rapids. The Dniester forms an important channel for trade in the areas of Mohyliv-Podilskyi, Zhvanets, and other Podolian river ports.

In Podolia, &#x27;black earth&#x27; (&quot;chernozem&quot;) soil predominates, making it a very fertile agricultural area. Marshes occur only beside the Bug. A moderate climate predominates, with average temperatures at Kamianets-Podilskyi of ( in January, in July).

Russian-ruled Podolia in 1906 had an estimated population of 3,543,700, consisting chiefly of Ukrainians. Significant minorities included Poles and Jews, as well as 50,000 Romanians, some Germans, and some Armenians.

The chief settlements include Kamianets-Podilskyi, the traditional capital, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, Rîbnița, Mohyliv-Podilskyi, Haisyn, Balta, Bar, Camenca, Yampil, Bratslav, and Letychiv.

Podolia is known for its cherries, mulberries, melons, gourds, and cucumbers.

==History==

===Early history===
The region has had human inhabitants since at least the beginning of the Neolithic period. Herodotus mentions it as the seat of the Graeco-Scythian Alazones and possibly the Neuri. Subsequently, the Dacians and the Getae arrived. The Romans left traces of their rule in Trajan&#x27;s Wall, which stretches through the modern districts of Kamianets-Podilskyi, Nova Ushytsia, and Khmelnytskyi.

During the Migration Period, many peoples passed through this territory or settled within it for some time, leaving numerous traces in archaeological remains. Nestor in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; mentions four apparently Slavic tribes: the Buzhans and Dulebes along the Southern Bug River, and the Tivertsi and Ulichs along the Dniester. The Avars invaded in the 7th century. Later. the Bolokhoveni occupied the same territory in the 13th century.

Prince Oleg extended his rule over this territory known as the Ponizie, or &quot;lowlands&quot;. These lowlands later became a part of the principalities of Volhynia, Kiev, and Galicia. In the 13th century, Bakota served as its political and administrative centre.

===Lithuanian and Polish rule===
During the 13th century, the Mongols plundered Ponizie; Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, freed it from their rule following his victory against the Golden Horde in the Battle of Blue Waters of 1362, annexing it to Lithuania under the name of &quot;Podolia&quot;, which has the same meaning as Ponizie, and in 1366 western Podolia with Kamieniec Podolski passed under Polish sovereignty. In 1375, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kamianets-Podilskyi was founded. Polish colonisation began in the 14th century.
After the death of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas in 1430, Podolia was incorporated into Podolian Voivodeship of the Kingdom of Poland, with the exception of its eastern part, the Bracław Voivodeship, which remained with Lithuania, both forming part of the Polish–Lithuanian union. With the Union of Lublin of 1569, eastern Podolia passed from Lithuania to Poland with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Kamieniec Podolski Fortress was nicknamed the &quot;gateway to Poland&quot;, whereas the city of Kamieniec Podolski itself as one of Poland&#x27;s major cities enjoyed voting rights during the royal election period. Podolia was invaded several times by the Crimean Tatars and Turks, and during the Deluge, also by Transylvanians and Russians, with notable Polish victories at Udycz (1606), Czarny Ostrów (1657), Uścieczko (1694).

From 1672, Podolia became part of the Ottoman Empire, when and where it was known as Podolia Eyalet. During this time, it was a province, with its center being Kamaniçe, and was divided into the sanjaks of Kamaniçe, Bar, Mejibuji and Yazlovets (Yazlofça). It returned to Poland in 1699 with the Treaty of Karlowitz.

The region was the site of two notorious massacres, the Batoh massacre of 1652, in which several thousand Poles were murdered by the Cossacks, and the Massacre of Uman of 1768, in which several thousand Poles, Jews and Uniates were murdered by haidamaks.

In 1768, the Bar Confederation was formed by the Poles, including Casimir Pulaski in Bar in Podolia. Podolia remained part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until its Partitions of Poland in 1772 and 1793, when the Austrian and Russian Empires annexed the western and eastern parts respectively.

===Russian and Austrian rule===

From 1793 to 1917, part of the region was the Podolia Governorate in southwestern Russia bordering with Austria across the Zbruch River and with Bessarabia across the Dniester. Its area was .

In 1772 First Partition of Poland, the Austrian Habsburgs had taken control of a small part of Podolia west of the Zbruch River (sometimes also called &quot;Southern Podolia&quot;) around Borschiv, in what is today Ternopil Oblast. At this time, Emperor Joseph II toured the area, was impressed by the fertility of the soil, and was optimistic about its future prospects. Poland disappeared as a state in a third partition in 1795 but the Polish gentry continued to maintain local control in both eastern and western Podolia over a peasant population which was primarily ethnically Ukrainian whose similarity to the other East Slavs already subject to the Habsburg monarchy was showcased in a 1772 book by Adam F. Kollár and was used as an argument in favor of annexation by the Habsburgs. The Ternopil (Tarnopol) region of western Podolia was briefly taken by Russia in 1809 but reverted to Austrian rule in 1815. Within the Austrian Empire, western Podolia was part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria which, in 1867 with the formation of Austria-Hungary, became an ethnic Pole-administered autonomous unit under the Austrian crown. At the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Austrian Podolia witnessed a large-scale emigration of its peasant population to western Canada.

Several battles of the Polish uprisings of 1809, 1830–1831 and 1863–1864 were fought in Podolia.

As to the Jewish community in Podolia, the Haskalah or Jewish Enlightenment reached it in the 19th century, introduced by Jews from Western Europe. Says I A. Bar-Levy (Weissman), author of the &quot;Yizkor Book&quot; for Podolia: &quot;It brought an end to the cultural separation of Jews from the surrounding world. Jews began to learn modern sciences and languages, read world literature and participate in the cultural life of the nations among whom they lived.&quot; Just as was the case in other areas of former Poland, Jews started to learn the language of the country they lived in and to write about secular subjects. The writers of the Haskalah in Podolia included: the forerunner Isaac Satanow (1733–1805), Menachim Mendel Lapin, author and translator, Ben-Ami (Mordecai Rabinowitz), who wrote in Russian, and many others.

===Between Poland and the Soviet Union===

With the collapse of Austria-Hungary following World War I in November 1918, western Podolia was included in the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, but came under Polish control in 1919 which was confirmed in the Poland–Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic agreement in April 1920. Podolia was briefly occupied in 1920 by Soviets during the course of the Polish–Soviet War. At same war, Poland briefly occupied eastern Podolia in 1919 and again in 1920. After the Peace of Riga the Polish control of western Podolia was recognized by the USSR. USSR retained eastern Podalia. There were pogroms during this period.

In Poland from 1921 to 1939, western Podolia was part of the Tarnopol Voivodeship. Eastern Podolia remained in the Ukrainian SSR and between 1922 and 1940, in the southwestern part, the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created.

In 1927 there was a massive uprising of peasants and factory workers in Mohyliv-Podilskyi, Kamianets-Podilskyi, Tiraspol and other cities of southern Ukrainian SSR against Soviet authorities. Troops from Moscow were sent to the region and suppressed the unrest, causing around 4000 deaths, according to US correspondents sent to report about the insurrection, which was at the time completely denied by the Kremlin official press.

In 1939 after the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939, the area became part of Soviet Ukraine. Many local inhabitants were deported to labour camps. In January 1940, the Czortków uprising, an unsuccessful Polish uprising against Soviet occupiers, took place in pre-war Polish Podolia. Following German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, most of Podolia was occupied by Nazi Germany and incorporated into the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. The area of Podolia between the Southern Bug below Vinnytsia and the Dniester was occupied by Axis Romania as part of Transnistria.

Starting in July 1941, the Jewish inhabitants were subjected to mass extermination by shooting in a German campaign carried out by four &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; (&quot;operational groups&quot;) specially organized for the purpose. Reliable estimates including German, Soviet, and local records indicate that upwards of 1.6 million, perhaps as many as 2 million, Jews were murdered in this fashion. Most were buried in mass graves, but there were also instances of communities being forced &quot;en masse&quot; into community buildings or synagogues that were then burnt, or herded into local mines that were subsequently dynamited.

The Germans operated the Stalag 310, Stalag 329, Stalag 349 and Stalag 355 prisoner-of-war camps in Podolia.

In 1944 the Soviets re-occupied Podolia and in 1945, when Poland&#x27;s eastern border was formally realigned along the Curzon line, the whole of Podolia remained in the Ukrainian and Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republics. Most remaining Poles and Jews fled or were expelled to the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland.

== Culture ==
The Podillia&#x27;s folk icon-painting tradition is well known in Ukraine. Its manifestation is long home iconostases painted on canvas at the end of the 19th to the beginning of the 20th centuries. Red, green and yellow colours prevail, the faces of the saints are a little bit longer, their eyes almond-like. On these iconostases, the most venerated family saints were painted. The collections of Podillya&#x27;s folk iconostases are possessed by Vinnytsya Art Museum and The Museum of Ukrainian Home Icons in the Radomysl Castle. Podillia is also notable as the birthplace of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidic Judaism, and as the cradle of the Frankist movement, a controversial Jewish religious sect.

<text>Figure skates are a type of ice skate used by figure skaters. The skates consist of a &quot;boot&quot; and a &quot;blade&quot; that is attached with screws to the sole of the boot. Inexpensive sets for recreational skaters are available, but most figure skaters purchase boots and blades separately and have the blades mounted by a professional skate technician.

==History==
The bladed skate was invented prior to the 14th century, probably in Holland. Up to this point, skates were not sharpened, made from the legs of large animals, and strapped to the skater&#x27;s shoes. Skaters used poles, like those used in skiing, to push themselves forward, which were discarded after the invention of the bladed skate because skaters were able to push off from one skate and glide on the other. The use of bladed skates resulted in the development of stroking and gliding, figure skating&#x27;s most basic elements, as well as the invention of the Dutch roll, the sport&#x27;s first figure.

During the 19th century, new forms of ice skates were developed to allow for even more control and safer gliding. Specific &quot;figure&quot; skates were created in response to the rise of figure skating&#x27;s popularity in the 19th century, coinciding with the beginnings of formalized competitions such as the World Figure Skating Championships. The name &quot;figure&quot; skating arises from the compulsory portion of the competition, dropped in the 1990s, requiring skaters to trace out precise figures on the ice, including perfect figure 8 circles. Figure skates are now manufactured with extreme precision for use in competitive sports. Blades are specifically designed to include various types of toe picks that allow for skaters to reach new heights for jumps and spins, depending on the skater&#x27;s level.

==Boots==
Figure skating boots are traditionally made by hand from many layers of leather. The design of figure skating boots changed significantly during the 20th century. Old photographs of skaters such as Sonja Henie from the 1920s and 1930s show them wearing thin, supple boots reaching to mid-calf. Modern skating boots, on the other hand, are extremely rigid to support the foot and ankle in jumps, and are cut much lower—just over ankle height—to allow the foot to flex. Because the stiffness of the boots makes good fit essential, many skaters either order custom boots or have their boots &quot;bumped out&quot; over pressure points by a skate technician.

In recent years, boots made of synthetic materials with heat-modifiable linings have become popular with many skaters because they combine strength with lighter weight than leather boots, and are easier to &quot;break in.&quot; The latest development in boot technology is a boot that is hinged at the ankle to provide lateral support while allowing more flexibility. Boots used in ice dance are usually slightly lower in the back to allow for greater bend in the ankle. Some boots also come with a flexible elastic back.

The typical colors for boots are black for men and white for women, although other colors are available.

==Blades==
Figure skates differ most visibly from hockey skates in having a set of large, jagged teeth called &quot;toe picks&quot; on the front of the blade. The toe picks are used primarily in jumping, footwork and spins and should not be used for stroking. Toe pick designs have become quite elaborate and sometimes include additional picks on the sides of the blade, often referred to as a k-pick.

The skate blades are typically made of tempered carbon steel, coated with a high-quality chrome. Lightweight aluminum and stainless steel blades are becoming more popular with skaters. Blades are about thick and may have a slightly tapered cross-section. There are different blades for different levels of skaters which often correspond to a skater&#x27;s age, size and skill level. Blades for advanced skaters often have larger toe picks and different curves than blades for beginner, intermediate and recreational levels.

When viewed from the side, the blade of a figure skate is not flat, but curved slightly, forming an arc of a circle with a radius of . This curvature is referred to as the &quot;rocker&quot; of the blade. The &quot;sweet spot&quot; of the blade is below the ball of the foot. This spot is usually located near the stanchion of the blade, and is the part of the blade where all spins are spun on.

The blade is also &quot;hollow ground&quot;; a groove on the bottom of the blade that creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. In figure skating it is always desirable to skate on only one edge of the blade, never on both at the same time (which is referred to as a &quot;flat&quot;). The apparently effortless power and glide across the ice exhibited by elite figure skaters fundamentally derives from efficient use of the edges to generate speed.

Ice dancers&#x27; and synchronized skaters&#x27; blades are about an inch shorter in the rear than those used by skaters in other disciplines, to accommodate the intricate footwork and close partnering in dance. They also possess a smaller pick near the bottom to allow for better edge-work and less focus on jumping.

Skating, when the &quot;physics of steel blades traveling across ice&quot; is exploited, provides for human movement impossible in other media. For example, the minimal friction required between the narrow steel blade and the ice that melts beneath it allows a skater to glide across an ice rink. As a result of this lack of friction, the skater&#x27;s body is &quot;simultaneously motionless with respect to itself and in motion with respect to its surroundings and to a fixed visual point of view&quot;. The lack of friction also allows a skater to spin continuously in place faster and for a longer time than on any other media and surface by allowing for both linear and sustained rotational motion, which presents &quot;a constantly changing three-dimensional picture to a fixed observer&quot; of the skater, who does this by either moving their body parts around the spinning center or by holding a single position. The skater can also jump higher and further, as well as stay in the air longer, than with any other media and surface. As writer Ellyn Kestnbaum states, &quot;The use of special dance floors and shoes or equipment and media such as bodies of water, skis, trapezes and trampolines can also enable people to achieve many of these effects, but none allows for combining them with quite the fluidity of ice skating&quot;.

===Blade types===
Various specialty blade types exist, including:
* Tapered figure skating blades have a design which causes them to be thicker at the front near the toe picks and thinner at the tail of the blade; therefore, the edges are not parallel.
* Side-honed figure skating blades have a concave design which causes them to be thicker at the stanchions and the edge stripe and thinner in between. They are easily recognizable because they cause reflections to be inverted.
* Parabolic figure skating blades were first introduced by HD Sports in order to employ new scientific developments in the creation of figure skating blades. The middle section of parabolic blades is thinner than that of normal blades, while both ends are typically wider than those of regular blades. This translates into less steel and a lighter blade overall. Their design is meant to improve skaters&#x27; blade stability, footwork, and edges.

===Blade sharpness===
Blades for figure skates require a certain sharpness level to maintain control on the ice. Blades are typically sold unsharpened, and it is the responsibility of the customer to make sure the blades get sharpened before leaving the shop. Typically, the blades can be expected to be sharpened by the owner of the skate shop, but knowing one&#x27;s skill level is necessary to get a correct sharpness. A deeply sharpened &quot;V&quot; cut on the blade should be reserved for professional figure skaters, as stopping on blades this sharp without an adequate amount of skill and strength can easily cause injuries such as sprains if one is not experienced enough. Figure skating blades that are too sharp can also be cause for concern, as the skater may find their feet slipping out to the side, making falls and sprains much more likely. Skates are sharpened by a grindstone, and the deeper the cut, the quicker the user can stop or turn on the ice. Professional skaters have their skates sharpened to the deepest possible cut in order to pull off complicated spins, jumps, and footwork. The ability to stop on a dime is important in events such as the Grand Prix, where even a single point deducted can cost the competitor the lead. If a competitor is in the unfortunate position of finding their blades to be too dull to support themselves adequately after a jump combination, they could touch down on the ice or fall, which can ruin an otherwise point-grabbing sequence.

==Skate guards==
Skate guards are a cover for the blades of skates. These guards act as a cover to protect the blades from wear and tear, or to keep the blades from rusting over. Typically, blades are composed of a stainless steel frame, but even this durable material is prone to rust if left covered in moisture, such as the water and ice produced by a long day marking up the rink. The best type of skate guard for this scenario is a terry cloth guard, called &quot;&quot;soakers&quot;,&quot; which absorb any leftover moisture and prevents the appearance of rust on the blades. Another common type of skate guard are made of hard plastic, and they are used by competitors and skaters when walking around in skates when off the ice. These durable covers delay the dulling of the blades by providing a protective barrier between the blade and the ground. Oftentimes, skate guards can be seen being used by competitors after their performances while they wait for their scores to be announced at the Kiss and Cry area. Since scores are presented soon after the performance has ended, many skaters do not have time to remove the tight laces of their skates before their placement is announced. Skate guards are also a method of personalizing one&#x27;s skates, and as such, there is a decent market within the skating community for personalized and customized skate guards. Since the purpose of the guards is to protect the blades, guards can be decorated with any number of markings or materials, even being bedazzled or gold plated if the owner desires.

<text>The Second Baptist Church, located at 441 Monroe Street within Greektown in Detroit, Michigan, is the oldest African-American church in the Midwestern United States. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974 listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

==History==
The church was organized in March 1836 by 13 former slaves who left the First Baptist Church due to discrimination. Second Baptist was Detroit&#x27;s seventh major church. With the Detroit River and Canada&#x27;s border only a thousand yards away, the Second Baptist Church quickly undertook the mission of helping free slaves and constructed a room under the sanctuary where escaping slaves stayed until they could continue their journey. Church leaders assisted in creating the Amherstburg Baptist Association and the Canadian Anti-Slavery Baptist Association, each of which were abolitionist groups in Canada. From its founding until the end of the Civil War, the church served as a &quot;station&quot; on the Underground Railroad, hosting some 5,000 slaves before their eventual departure to Canada.

Second Baptist also opened the city&#x27;s first school for black children in 1839, and in 1843 and 1865 hosted a &quot;State Convention of Colored Citizens&quot; to petition the Michigan government for Negro Suffrage. Ralph Bunche, who later became the first African-American to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, was baptized in the church. Second Baptist was instrumental in the formation of over 30 other African-American churches.

==Building==
The current building was erected in 1914 and contains three floors. It replaced an earlier structure which was destroyed by fire. Additions to the building were made in 1926 and 1968 and flank the original structure. The 1914 and 1926 buildings are brick with Gothic Revival accents in limestone.

The footprint of the 1914 building is rectangular with a gabled roof. The facade is dominated by a large lancet window with wood tracery. Below the window twin entrance doors inside gothic arches are framed by a crenellated parapet.

The 1968 addition is in the Brutalist style and has four floors by Nathan Johnson. Horizontal bands of windows wrap the second and third floors with fourth floor windows set into a grille of precast concrete. Below the windows of the second and third floors are precast concrete panels that also wrap the structure. The flat roof extends several feet on all sides to form a broad cornice.

==Current status==
The Second Baptist Church is a member of the predominantly black Progressive National Baptist Convention and of the predominantly white American Baptist Churches in the USA. Reverend Lawrence W. Rodgers is the Senior Pastor, the 24th person to hold that position at Second Baptist.

<text>Larb (; , , ), also spelled laab, laap, larp, or lahb, is a traditional Lao minced meat salad and a national dish of Laos. Known for its bold and harmonious flavors, it is a cornerstone of Lao cuisine, often accompanied by sticky rice and green papaya salad.

Larb features minced meat, often pork, chicken, beef, duck, or fish, seasoned with lime juice, fish sauce, roasted ground rice, and fresh herbs like mint, with chili commonly added for heat. Larb is typically served with sticky rice and is integral to Lao cultural and celebratory meals. 

Originating in Laos, larb has influenced the cuisines of neighboring regions, particularly northeastern and northern Thailand (Isan and Lanna), which share historical ties with the former Lan Xang Kingdom. Variants of larb also appear in the cuisines of other Tai-speaking peoples, such as those in Shan State, Myanmar, and Yunnan Province, China. Despite regional adaptations, larb&#x27;s roots remain distinctly Lao.

==History==
Commissioned by the Chinese Qianlong emperor in 1751, the Qing Imperial Illustrations of Tributary Peoples describes the Lao people as the following: &quot;The Laowo (Lao) are customarily called Wojia [...] They like to eat raw meat.&quot;

Étienne François Aymonier, who visited Laos in 1883, described laab as a favorite dish of Lao people – a mixture of chopped onions or scallions, lemongrass leaves, fermented fish and chili mixed with fresh and boiled fish. The dish was eaten with steam-cooked sticky rice. Another French visitor, Doctor Estrade, who arrived in 1893, described larb as a Lao main dish made with boiled fish, chili and ground roasted sticky rice.

Depending on the method of preparation, it may be known by different names, including &quot;nam tok, goi/saa, yum/sua,&quot; and can be made with beef, buffalo, chicken, duck, fish, pork, shrimp, game meat, mushroom or even algae. Laab can be served raw, which is known as &quot;laab diip&quot; (raw) or &quot;aharn suer&quot; (tiger food), or cooked, and usually served with a soup made with the bones of the meat being used.

Historically, laab dishes were more common amongst the aristocracy and traditional recipes for laab served to Laotian royalty are in a collection of handwritten recipes from Phia Sing (1898–1967), royal chef and master of ceremonies. Laab is considered to be an auspicious and lucky dish because traditionally meat was not readily available, and most Laotians would normally eat laab at special occasions, such as wedding, New Year celebrations and festivals. Many Laotians will bless their family and guests with a meal consisting of laab for luck and good fortune. During the New Year celebration, many Lao families believe that eating laab on day one of the three-day celebration will bring good fortune for the rest of the year.

Prior to the collapse of the monarchy, in Laotian high society, servants were never allowed to prepare the best and most delicate dishes. The women of Laotian high society considered it an honorable task and great opportunity to display their culinary talents to prepare laab for their esteemed guests. Among ordinary Laotians, when preparing laab, housewives would prepare the ingredients in separate containers as a &quot;mise en place&quot;, leaving the final honor of mixing all the ingredients in a large bowl to the head of the household. As tradition goes, the head of the family would start with malaxating the mincemeat – softening and incorporating it with a cupful of stock from the soup, then adding the toasted ground rice, pepper powder, garlic, salt, padaek sauce and finally chopped aromatics before serving.

Laab has a meaning in the Lan Na dialect (1292–1775), the neighboring kingdom of Lan Xang (1353–1707, present day Laos). The name derived from the full word of &quot;จิ๊นลาบ&quot;, the word &quot;จิ๊น&quot; translates to animal meat while &quot;ลาบ&quot; means to chop into smaller pieces or mince in Lanna script (closely linked to Tai Tham). However, in ancient Lanna dialect, the word “ฟัก” (&quot;fak&quot;) was always used for &quot;mince&quot;.

==Types==

===Lao style===
In Laos, depending on how the dish is prepared, it may be known by different names, including &quot;nam tok, goi/saa, yum/sua.&quot; Modern &quot;laab&quot; is most often made with chicken, beef, duck, fish, pork or mushrooms, flavored with fish sauce, lime juice, padaek, roasted ground rice and fresh herbs. The meat can be either raw or cooked; it is minced and mixed with chili, mint, roughly ground toasted rice (&quot;khao khoua&quot;) and, optionally, assorted vegetables according to personal preference. The dish is served at room temperature and usually with a serving of sticky rice and raw or fresh vegetables. Traditionally, beef laab will only contain offal, bile, and all of the other ingredients without lime juice. Fish and shrimp laab are also traditionally absent lime juice but incorporate minced galangal. Compared to other laab, fish and shrimp laab does require an extra step. The deboned fish filet, or shrimp is minced, then pounded in a mortar and pestle until it turns to a gluey paste.  Padaek juice is carefully added to the mixture, and stirred to a desired consistency, before finishing off with the finely chopped galangal and other aromatic herbs.
* Nam tok: &quot;Nam tok&quot; (, ) is a Lao and Thai word meaning &#x27;&#x27;. The name is derived either from the dripping of the meat juices during the grilling or from the juices running out of the medium rare beef as it is sliced. It refers to a popular Lao meat dish in both Laos and Isan, where it is commonly known as &quot;ping sin nam tok&quot; (Laos) or &quot;nuea yang nam tok&quot; (Thailand). This dish can be regarded as a variation on the standard &quot;laab&quot;, and is made from barbecued pork or beef, usually the neck, which is sliced in bite-size pieces. The meat is then brought to a boil with some stock to create sauce. The heat is turned off, and then sliced shallots, ground roasted rice, chili powder, lime juice, and fish sauce are added, along with shredded coriander leaves, spring onions and mint leaves.
* Goi/Saa: &quot;Goi&quot; (), &quot;Saa&quot; () is a laab-like dish with the meat sliced thinly, rather than minced. In Luang Prabang and northern Laos this method of preparation is referred to as &quot;saa&quot;, whereas in Vientiane and southern Laos it is known as &quot;goi&quot;. Raw &quot;goi&quot; or &quot;saa&quot; made with the freshest and highest quality fish is served to the most honored guests because it is the most delicate and complicated dish to prepare. A properly made &quot;goi&quot; or &quot;saa&quot; requires great knife skills and talent. The raw fish is filleted, deboned and sliced. The fish is then left to soak in a marinade consisting of saltwater brine and lime juice for 2 up to a maximum of 15 minutes depending on preference. This denaturing of the proteins &quot;cooks&quot; the fish much like the Latin American dish ceviche. Once marinated, the meat is squeezed until dry to remove the excess liquid. The left-over marinade from the fish is then combined with padaek and brought to a boil before being left to cool to form a sauce. When everything is ready, the fish is mixed with the sauce, roasted rice powder, pepper flakes, and finely chopped aromatic herbs, such as fennel, galangal, lemongrass, Laotian parsley, shallot, green onions, and mint. The mixture can further be seasoned with more salt or lime to taste. The final dish is a pale pink fish salad with green aromatics and always served with the soup stock of the fish bone, fresh vegetables and sticky rice. A similar dish exists in Vietnam known as&quot; bo tai chanh.&quot;
* Niao/Niaow: Another style, similar to method of making fish and shrimp laab, is a beef or water buffalo version called &quot;laab niaow&quot; (sticky laab), where a piece of raw lean meat is minced and then pounded together with fresh galangal, grilled garlic, shallots, dried chilli pepper, padaek liquid and beef broth into a thick paste or mixture. Finally, cooked and sliced liver, heart, spleen, rice powder (khao khoua), fried aromatics (chopped garlic, green onions, lemongrass), and fresh aromatics (chopped green onions and coriander) are stirred into the mixture and topped off as garnish before serving.
* Yum/Sua: Another style more ancient, which was popular amongst the aristocrats and served to Lao royalty is &quot;yum gai tom (boiled chicken)&quot; or &quot;sua gai (chicken)&quot;. The recipes for the royal &quot;yum gai tom&quot; is found in Phia Sing&#x27;s writing. &quot;Yum gai tom&quot; or &quot;sua gai&quot; is prepared by boiling a whole chicken with lemongrass, ginger, and kefir lime leaves. Once the chicken is cooked, the meat is removed from the carcass and chopped or shredded. Added to this are chopped cucumbers and tomatoes (optional), chili peppers, half-roasted shallots and garlic, and toasted rice powder. Broth is added to moisten, along with lime juice, and fish sauce. Pepper and salt are added to taste. It is finished with spring onions on top and coriander to garnish.

===Tai Nyuan/Lan Na style===
Laab in the old kingdom of Lanna (1292–1775), is a local delicacy popular to aristocrats in the area. The name derived from the full word of &quot;จิ๊นลาบ&quot;, the word &quot;จิ๊น&quot; means animal meat while &quot;ลาบ&quot; means to chop into smaller pieces or mince in Lanna script (closely linked to Tai Tham).

Laab was enjoyed in both raw or cooked forms depends on the likings. The cooked laab is mostly roasted and, therefore, called &quot;ลาบคั่ว&quot; (roasted laab)&quot;.&quot;

The raw laab are known as &quot;ลาบเลือด&quot; (blood laab), popularly eaten alongside alcohol. In the ancient times, it is made solely by men and women were banned from the process due to the notion that women could contaminate the dish with menstruated blood.

Lanna people often eat laab during auspicious celebrations such as the new year or Songkran, housewarming, weddings, ordination, and other Buddhist festivities. It is influenced by the Thai word &quot;ลาภ&quot; (derived from Pali) homophone: meaning unexpected luck or fortune. 

The &quot;laab&quot; from northern Thailand where the Lao have migrated, &quot;laab Lan Na&quot;, is different from the internationally more well-known Lao style &quot;laab&quot;. The northern Thai &quot;laab&quot; of the Tai Nyuan/Khon Muang (northern Thai people) does not contain fish sauce and is not sour, as neither lime juice nor any other souring agent is used. Instead, the northern Thai version uses a mix of dried spices as flavoring and seasoning which includes ingredients such as cumin, cloves, long pepper, star anise, prickly ash seeds and cinnamon amongst others, derived from the location of northern Thailand&#x27;s Lan Na Kingdom on one of the spice routes to China, in addition to ground dried chillies, and, in the case of &quot;laab&quot; made with pork or chicken, the blood of the animal. The dish can be eaten raw (&quot;laab dip&quot;), but also after it has been stir-fried for a short time (&quot;laab suk&quot;). If blood is omitted from the preparation of the stir-fried version, the dish is called &quot;laab khua&quot; (). There is also a kind of &quot;laab&quot; called &quot;laab luat&quot; () or &quot;lu&quot; (). This dish is made with minced raw pork or beef, raw blood, kidney, fat and bile, and mixed with spices, crispy fried onions, fresh herbs and other ingredients. &quot;Laab&quot; and its other variations are served with an assortment of fresh vegetables and herbs, and eaten with glutinous rice. This version of &quot;laab&quot; is thought to have originated in the town of Phrae, in northern Thailand. This style of &quot;laab&quot; can also be found in parts of northern Laos.

==Health risks of consuming raw==
The risks from eating raw meat include contracting trichinosis, caused by an infectious worm, along with fatal bacterial or potentially rabies infection.
The consumption of raw &quot;laab&quot; and &quot;lu&quot; made with raw pork has led to several cases of human &quot;Streptococcus suis&quot; infections in Thailand, some of them with a deadly result.

The consumption of raw freshwater fish can lead to an infection by &quot;Opisthorchis viverrini&quot; (Southeast Asian liver fluke), a parasitic flatworm that can live for many years inside the human liver. Northern Thailand, where certain fishes are consumed fermented, has the highest recorded rate of medically untreatable cholangiocarcinoma.

<text>The series (typically localized as River City) is a video game series started by Technōs Japan. The series is now handled by Arc System Works who purchased all of the intellectual property rights from Technōs&#x27; successor, Million Corp. The first game in the series is fully titled , which roughly translates to &quot;Hot Blood Tough Guy Kunio&quot;, with Nekketsu being the name of the series&#x27; title character Kunio&#x27;s high school. The kun suffix after his name is an informal Japanese honorific usually applied to young males. The series originated in arcades, before appearing on the Famicom console. Kunio later became Technōs Japan&#x27;s main mascot, appearing on the company&#x27;s logo in several games and television commercials.

A few of the early &quot;Kunio&quot; games for the NES were localized for the North American market. These include &quot;Renegade&quot;, &quot;River City Ransom&quot;, &quot;Super Dodge Ball&quot;, &quot;Crash &#x27;n&#x27; the Boys: Street Challenge&quot; and &quot;Nintendo World Cup&quot;, which are heavily &quot;Americanized&quot; versions of the &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; games. Technōs Japan has released over twenty &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; titles for the Famicom, Game Boy, and Super Famicom in Japan. In addition, licensed ports of the games were made for other platforms such as the PC-Engine (through Naxat Soft), Mega Drive (through Pal Soft) and the X68000 (through Sharp).

==Development==
The original game &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot; was created by Yoshihisa Kishimoto. He pitched a semi-autobiographical game based on his teenage high school years, with the protagonist Kunio-kun loosely based on himself. Kishimoto recalled his experiences as a high school student regularly getting into fights on a daily basis, which was partly triggered by a break-up with a girl who dumped him. Kishimito was also a fan of Bruce Lee&#x27;s Hong Kong martial arts films, particularly &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973). He combined elements from Lee&#x27;s &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; with that of his own life to create the concept for &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot;. He went on to design &quot;Double Dragon&quot; (1987), which was originally envisioned as a direct sequel to the original &quot;Kunio-Kun&quot; game, before becoming a new game with a different cast and setting.

The game&#x27;s title and its protagonist, Kunio (variously renamed &quot;Alex&quot; and &quot;Crash Cooney&quot; in the United States), were named after Technōs Japan&#x27;s former president, Kunio Taki. Many of the later games in the &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; series, particularly those under the &quot;Downtown Nekketsu&quot; moniker, were the handiwork of two men: Mitsuhiro &quot;Yoshimitsu&quot; Yoshida and Hiroyuki &quot;Mokeke&quot; Sekimoto.

&quot;Renegade&quot;, the Western localization of &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot;, spawned its own separate spin-off series developed by British company Ocean Software for home computers. There were two &quot;Renegade&quot; sequels: &quot;&quot; (1988) and &quot;Renegade III: The Final Chapter&quot; (1989).

Kunio first appears in the original &quot;Nekketsu Renegade Kunio-kun&quot;, where he is described as a second year student at Nekketsu High School (in the &quot;Downtown Nekketsu&quot; sub-series, he is described as a third year student, establishing a loose continuity between later games). His surname is never revealed, but the live-action television series lists his surname as Fu&#x27;unji. In some games (such as &quot;Nekketsu Hockey Club&quot; and &quot;Baseball Monogatari&quot;), he is the only student at Nekketsu to wear an all-white uniform, while at other games everyone at Nekketsu wears white.

<text>Jean-Pierre Wimille (26 February 1908 – 28 January 1949) was a French racing driver and a member of the French Resistance during World War II. He was a two-time victor of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, winning in 1937 and 1939. He is generally regarded as one of the best French drivers of his era.

== Biography ==

Wimille was born in Paris, France to a father who was employed as the motoring correspondent for the Petit Parisien newspaper. Jean-Pierre Wimille developed a fascination with racing cars at a young age. He was 22 years old when he made his Grand Prix debut, driving a Bugatti 37A at the 1930 French Grand Prix in Pau.

=== Driving career ===

In 1931, Wimille finished second at the Monte Carlo Rally, driving a Lorraine-Dietrich. Driving a Bugatti T51, in 1932 he won the La Turbie hill climb, the Grand Prix de Lorraine and the Grand Prix d&#x27;Oran. In 1934 he was the victor at the Algerian Grand Prix in Algiers driving a Bugatti T59 and in January 1936 he finished second in the South African Grand Prix held at the Prince George Circuit in East London, South Africa then won the French Grand Prix in his home country.

Still in France, that same year Wimille won the Deauville Grand Prix, a race held on the city&#x27;s streets. He won in his Bugatti T59 in an accident-marred race that killed drivers Raymond Chambost and Marcel Lehoux in separate incidents. Of the 16 cars that started the race, only three managed to finish.

In 1936, Wimille traveled to Long Island, New York to compete in the Vanderbilt Cup where he finished second, behind the winner, Tazio Nuvolari. He also competed in the 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race, winning in 1937 and again in 1939. In 1940, Wimille developed with Marcel Lesurque an electric car able to reach 50 km/h.

=== World War II ===

When World War II came, and following the German occupation of France in 1940, Wimille and fellow Grand Prix race drivers Robert Benoist and William Grover-Williams joined the Special Operations Executive, which aided the French Resistance. Of the three, Wimille was the only one to survive.

=== Post-World War II ===

Wimille married Christiane de la Fressange with whom he had a son, François, born in 1946. At the end of the War, he became the No. 1 driver for the Alfa Romeo team between 1946 and 1948, winning several Grand Prix races including his second French Grand Prix. He had a long-standing affair with French singer Juliette Greco, whom he met in 1947 at the Tabou in Paris.

From 1946 on, Wimille built and designed cars in Paris under the brand-name Wimille. Between 1946 and 1950 around eight cars were built, at first with Citroën engines, later with Ford V8 engines.

=== Death ===

Wimille died when he lost control of his Simca-Gordini and crashed into a tree during practice runs for the 1949 Buenos Aires Grand Prix. He is buried in the Cimetière de Passy in Paris. There is a memorial to him at the Porte Dauphine on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris.

<text>The Progressive National Baptist Convention (PNBC), incorporated as the Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc., is a Baptist denomination emphasizing civil rights and social justice. The headquarters of the Progressive National Baptist Convention are in Washington, D.C. Part of the Black church tradition, since its organization, the denomination has member churches outside the United States, particularly in the Caribbean and Europe. It is a member of the National Council of Churches and the Baptist World Alliance.

==History==

The Progressive National Baptist Convention formed in 1961 after civil-rights-oriented Baptist ministers led by L. Venchael Booth of Zion Baptist Church in Cincinnati, failed to replace Joseph H. Jackson, the long-time head of the National Baptist Convention (NBC USA). The older group stood aloof from the civil rights movement which was often led by local Baptist ministers; the National Baptist Convention (NBC USA) often preached spiritual salvation rather than political activism. The dissidents nominated Gardner C. Taylor as president of the NBC USA.

After a fist fight between reformers and conservatives, in which one elderly minister was accidentally killed, Jackson&#x27;s supporters won. Martin Luther King  was ousted from the NBC USA and his goal of using the united power of the black Baptist community to promote civil rights came to nothing. His defeat prompted the formation of the new predominantly African American Baptist denomination.

Thirty-three delegates from 14 states gathered at Zion Baptist Church in Cincinnati to discuss the issue. The vote to organize passed by one vote. L. Venchael Booth, pastor of Zion Baptist in Cincinnati, was elected first president of the convention. The convention was originally formed as the &quot;Progressive Baptist Convention&quot; and the word &quot;National&quot; was added to the name in 1962. The convention has grown from the original founding numbers to member congregations throughout the United States, the Caribbean, Europe and Africa.

Following a path of political activism, the Progressive National Baptist Convention supported groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and methods such as affirmative action. Famous civil rights leaders who were members of the PNBC include Martin Luther King Jr., Benjamin Mays, Ralph Abernathy, Wyatt Tee Walker, and Gardner C. Taylor. The Progressive National Baptist Convention bills the &quot;progressive concept&quot; as &quot;fellowship, progress, and peace.&quot;

In 1969, Uvee Mdodana Arbouin became the first ordained woman pastor in the convention.

In the early 2000s, the Progressive National Baptists united with the National Baptist Convention, National Baptist Convention of America, and National Missionary Baptist Convention as the Joint National Baptist Convention; in 2024, the PNBC cooperated with the four conventions again in order to establish a joint agenda for African American Baptists.

The Progressive National Baptist Convention celebrated its 50th Annual Session in Washington, D.C., in August 2011. The PBNC has partnered with the predominantly white mainline American Baptist Churches USA since 1970.

In 2022, the Progressive National Baptist Convention elected Jacqueline A. Thompson as second vice president, which made her the first woman to hold an elected leadership role in the Progressive National Baptist Convention.

On January 22, 2024, before the Joint National Baptist Convention, the PNBC called for a ceasefire in Gaza.

== Statistics ==
According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, in 1963, the PNBC had 500,000 members in 394 churches before growing to 2.5 million members in 1991 spread throughout 1,400 churches. Since then, the convention&#x27;s U.S.-based membership has stagnated, similar to the National Baptist Convention of America at the time. By 2009, the same organization numbered the PNBC as having 1,010,000 members in 1,500 churches. In 2020, the Association of Religion Data Archives reported the PNBC had 254,571 members in 363 churches in the United States. According to a census published by the Baptist World Alliance in 2022, however, it self-reported 1,500,000 members in 1,362 churches altogether. In another study by the World Council of Churches, its global membership was approximately 2,500,000.

==Doctrine==
In the Progressive National Baptist Convention, many members and affiliates identify with Progressive Baptist theology—being theologically moderate to liberal; this contrasts with the theologically conservative to moderate National Baptist Convention, National Baptist Convention of America, and National Missionary Baptist Convention. The Progressive National Baptist Convention collectively also recognizes the ordination of women. Contrasting, its predecessor—the NBC USA—has no official position on women&#x27;s ordination, though women do serve as pastors in the convention and in other leadership capacities. According to the PNBC, it creates &quot;opportunities for women in ministry to learn and serve.&quot; The Progressive National Baptist Convention also allows locally autonomous congregations to determine policy regarding same-sex marriages, and the PNBC has not taken an official stance on the issue, leaving room for diversity of opinion.

<text>In organic chemistry, an imino acid is any molecule that contains both imine (&gt;C=NH) and carboxyl (-C(=O)-OH) functional groups.

Imino acids are structurally related to amino acids, which have amino group instead of imine—a difference of single vs double-bond between nitrogen and carbon. The simplest example is dehydroglycine.

-Amino acid oxidase is an enzyme that is able to convert amino acids into imino acids. Also the direct biosynthetic precursor to the amino acid proline is the imino acid (&quot;S&quot;)-Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C). 

== Related terminology ==
Secondary amino acids, amino acids containing a secondary amine group are sometimes named imino acids, though this usage is obsolescent. The only proteinogenic amino acid of this type is proline, although the related non-proteinogenic amino acids hydroxyproline and pipecolic acid have often been included in studies of this class of compounds.

The term &quot;imino acid&quot; is also the obsolete term for &quot;imidic acids&quot;, structures containing the -C(=NH)-OH group, and should not be used for them.

<text>Fred Rerun Berry (born Fred Allen Berry; March 19, 1951 – October 21, 2003) was an American actor and street dancer. He was best known for his role as Freddie &quot;Rerun&quot; Stubbs on the 1970s television show &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; and its sequel series &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot;

==Career==
Berry was born on March 19, 1951, in St. Louis, Missouri, and grew up in the inner-city projects. He had aspirations of becoming a successful dancer and actor as a child. Early in his career, Berry was a member of the Los Angeles–based dance troupe The Lockers, with whom he appeared on the third episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1975. He additionally appeared on the dance music show &quot;Soul Train&quot;, and was featured in the program&#x27;s signature line dance segment doing the memorable early 1970s dance step &quot;the slo-mo&quot;.

Berry achieved more widespread fame playing the character Freddie &quot;Rerun&quot; Stubbs on the ABC sitcom &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;, which aired from 1976 to 1979 as he was in his mid 20s. The role was originally set for a skinny and white actor. The character was called Rerun as a sobriquet because he continuously repeated all of his classes during summer school. Rerun became one of the show&#x27;s top characters, wearing a trademark red beret and suspenders while sporting the dance moves that Berry previously used during his time with The Lockers. In 1985, Berry returned to reprise his role in the series &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot;. He was fired before the first season ended due to a salary dispute, in which Berry requested more money than the rest of the cast.

Berry struggled with drug and alcohol issues throughout his life. In 1996, he told People magazine, “I was a millionaire by the time I was 29, but then the stress of success got to me. The fat jokes got to me. And I got heavily into drugs and alcohol.” In a 1996 interview, he said that he had been experimenting with drugs and alcohol since he was a teenager, and becoming more successful meant he could afford more drugs. Berry attempted suicide three times, but later recovered and spent his time visiting many churches.

During the 1990s, Berry became a motivational speaker and Baptist minister, and lost 100 lbs after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

In 2001, he appeared as himself on the second Classic TV Stars edition of The Weakest Link where he was the first contestant voted off.

==Personal life and death==
Berry was married six times to four different women, the first two of whom he married twice each. He had three children: DeShannon, Portia and Freddy, who works as Fred Berry Jr.

Berry was born with the name Allen as his middle name, later legally changing his middle name to Rerun due to the widespread public association to his role as the character on &quot;What’s Happening!!&quot;

On October 21, 2003, Berry was found dead at his Los Angeles home, where he was recovering from a stroke. The cause of death was listed as natural causes. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.

<text>Raúl González Blanco (; born 27 June 1977), known mononymously as Raúl, is a Spanish football manager and former player who played as a forward. He is the current manager of Real Madrid Castilla, the reserve team of La Liga club Real Madrid. Regarded as one of the greatest forwards of all time, during a stage in his career he was simultaneously the all-time top scorer for Real Madrid, the Spain national team, and had the most goals in the UEFA Champions League. Raúl made over 1,000 appearances in his career.

Raúl spent 16 years of his career playing for Real Madrid, becoming the holder for most appearances with the club (741). With &quot;Los Blancos&quot;, he won six La Liga titles, three Champions Leagues, four Supercopa de España titles, one UEFA Super Cup, and two Intercontinental Cups. In 2001, he was runner-up in the Ballon d&#x27;Or, and two years later became captain of Real Madrid. Raúl left the club in 2010 with 323 goals scored for them, signing for Bundesliga side Schalke 04. He won a DFB-Pokal and DFL-Supercup in Germany before moving to Qatari club Al Sadd and then American club New York Cosmos. For Spain, Raúl scored 44 goals in 102 appearances and is regarded as one of his nation&#x27;s greatest ever players. He represented &quot;La Roja&quot; in three FIFA World Cups and two UEFA European Championships, being named in the Euro Team of the Tournament for 2000. He became the captain of the national team in 2002 and retired from international football in 2006. 

One of the most successful players in Champions League history, Raúl was named the UEFA Club Forward of the Year three years in a row (1999–2000, 2000–01 and 2001–02) and was the top goalscorer in the competition in 1999–2000 and 2000–2001. He was named the top international goalscorer in the world by International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics in 1999. Further awards include two Pichichi trophies, five Don Balón Awards, and the Best Player award at the 1998 Intercontinental Cup. In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players and was named in UEFA’s list of the 50 best European players of the 1954–2004 period. He was named in the European Team of the Year by European Sports Media in 1997, 1999, and 2000.

==Club career==

===Youth clubs===
Raúl&#x27;s career began at his local team CD San Cristóbal de los Ángeles playing for their &quot;Alevín&quot; team and the &quot;Infantil&quot; the next season. He signed with Atlético Madrid&#x27;s &quot;Infantil&quot; team and won a national title with the &quot;Cadete&quot; team the following season. Following Atlético&#x27;s then-president Jesús Gil decision to close their youth academy as a cost-saving measure, Raúl moved on to Real Madrid&#x27;s &quot;Cadete&quot; team in La Fábrica. The following season, he was promoted to the &quot;Juvenil C&quot; team and subsequently went on to play for their &quot;Juvenil B&quot; and &quot;Juvenil A&quot; team. While with the Real youth set-up, Raúl won the Dallas Cup in 1993 and 1994.

===Real Madrid===
He first started his professional career in the 1994–95 season with Real Madrid C. He scored 16 goals in just nine games (including five in one match against CD Corralejo) and was swiftly promoted to the first team by coach Jorge Valdano, replacing Emilio Butragueño in a symbolic &quot;passing of the crown.&quot; He became the youngest player – 17 years and 124 days – ever to play for the senior side, though the record was broken by Alberto Rivera later that same season. On 29 October 1994, in an away game against Real Zaragoza at La Romareda, he created a goal for strike partner Iván Zamorano, heralding the demise of Butragueño in the process. The next week, Raúl scored his first goal in his second senior game on a home debut against Madrid rivals and former youth club Atlético Madrid in a bitter derby match. Fully establishing himself as a fixture in the first team, Raúl registered a total of nine goals in 28 appearances to help Real Madrid win the 1994–95 league championship in his first season.With Real Madrid, he won several honours at the club, including further La Liga titles in 1996–97 (scoring 21 La Liga goals), 2000–01 (scoring 24 La Liga goals), and 2002–03 (scoring 16 La Liga goals in a campaign truncated by a bout of appendicitis for which Raúl was hospitalised). During the period from 1998 to 2002, Raúl and Real Madrid also won three UEFA Champions League trophies in 1998, 2000, and 2002. For most of this time, Raúl struck up a prolific scoring partnership with Fernando Morientes and later Ronaldo. During a La Liga game against fierce rivals Barcelona at the Nou Camp in October 1999, Raúl silenced the hostile home crowd of almost 100,000 fans when he scored and then memorably celebrated his goal by putting a finger to his lips as though to tell them to be quiet. Raúl took over the captaincy of Real Madrid when Fernando Hierro was transferred in 2003, a responsibility he held until leaving the club in 2010. Despite appearing in two finals, in 2002 (in which he scored) and 2004, Raúl never lifted the Copa del Rey.
He became the first player to score 50 Champions League goals when he scored in a 2–1 group stage win over Olympiacos on 28 September 2005, and was also the first to make 100 appearances in the competition. He was also the first player to score in two Champions League finals, since the competition was renamed, scoring in the finals of both 2000 against Valencia in the Stade de France, Saint-Denis, and 2002 against Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park, Glasgow.

Raúl holds the distinction of having never been sent off in his 17 years at the professional level. On 11 November 2008, Raúl scored his 300th goal for Real Madrid with a hat-trick against Real Unión, with Real winning the match 4–3 but being eliminated on away goals after drawing 6–6 on aggregate. In total, Raúl scored 323 goals for Real Madrid, breaking the long-standing club record of Alfredo Di Stéfano (307) with a volleyed goal against Sporting de Gijón on 15 February 2009. He is presently fifth on the all-time list of La Liga goalscorers, behind Argentine Lionel Messi, Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo, Spaniard Telmo Zarra and Mexican Hugo Sánchez.
Raúl and fellow long-serving teammate Iker Casillas were both awarded &quot;contracts for life&quot; in 2008, the terms of which stipulated that the contracts would be renewed annually for as long as they played 30 matches each season. On 23 September 2009, Raúl equalled Manolo Sanchís&#x27; league appearance record for Real Madrid, and is second in La Liga behind Andoni Zubizarreta, who played in 622 matches.

Along with years of captaincy for both Real Madrid and Spain, Raúl was known as &quot;El Capitan&quot; (&quot;The Captain&quot;).

Raúl&#x27;s last touch with the ball as a Real Madrid player before an injury ruled him out of action for the rest of that season was to score his last goal, the opening goal scored on 24 April 2010 in a 2–1 away victory against Real Zaragoza in La Romareda, coincidentally the stadium where he made his debut in 1994. It was scored in the 50th minute after Raúl (himself only on the pitch as a substitute for Rafael van der Vaart after 15 minutes) had signalled he could not physically continue and was prepared to be substituted off for Karim Benzema one minute after the goal. Before the substitution could be made, Real Madrid launched a counter-attack to create a goal. Though Raúl ran to a slow hobble, he shuffled into the box and was able to poke the ball from Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s pass.

Having spent the rest of the season recovering from that injury, the club confirmed on 25 July 2010 that Raúl would be leaving the club, a day after his teammate Guti confirmed he was also leaving after a 15-year spell.

===Schalke 04===

Raúl signed a two-year contract with Schalke 04 on 28 July 2010. Schalke head coach Felix Magath hailed the signing and told the club website, &quot;It&#x27;s great news for FC Schalke 04, I am pleased that we have succeeded in signing such an exceptional footballer and world-class striker switching to the Bundesliga for Schalke 04.&quot; Raúl chose Schalke because they qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League.

Raúl scored his first goal for the club during his first match on 1 August 2010 with a brace in a 3–1 victory over Bayern Munich in the final match of the pre-season competition LIGA total! Cup 2010. One week later, he made his competitive debut in the 2010 DFL-Supercup on 7 August 2010 again against Bayern, but this time he failed to score in the 2–0 defeat. Raúl made his Bundesliga debut on 21 August 2010 in a 2–1 defeat against Hamburger SV. and scored his first goal for Schalke in the Bundesliga against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 25 September 2010 in a 2–2 draw. After a quiet start, he rediscovered his goalscoring form in the Bundesliga with a brace against FC St. Pauli on 5 November in a 3–0 win, and on 20 November, he scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 4–0 win over Werder Bremen. On 18 December, he scored his second hat-trick for Schalke in a 3–0 win against 1. FC Köln.

Raúl scored another crucial goal on 2 March 2011 in a 1–0 victory over Bayern Munich in the semi-final of 2010–11 DFB-Pokal. After being absent for six years, Schalke ultimately reached the finals since 2005. In the final match, they played against MSV Duisburg, the first 2. Bundesliga team which reached the final since 2004. Raúl never won a domestic cup with Real Madrid (the Copa del Rey), but on 21 May 2011, in his first season, he finally won a domestic cup and got his maiden trophy with his new club. They won the tournament with a 5–0 win at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. This success was followed with victory two months later on 23 July 2011 in the 2011 DFL-Supercup against the league champions and rivals Borussia Dortmund.

In European play, Raúl has since become the highest goal scorer in all UEFA competitions with 73 goals, ahead of Milan veteran Filippo Inzaghi with 70 goals. He scored 71 goals in the Champions League (66 goals with Real Madrid and five with Schalke 04) and in addition his two goals with &quot;Los Blancos&quot;, one goal in the 2000 UEFA Super Cup and the other one in the 1998 Intercontinental Cup. On 22 October 2010, Raúl scored twice against Hapoel Tel Aviv in a 3–1 win, which tied him with German legend Gerd Müller for the most European goals. Raúl fully broke this record on 15 February 2011 on his return to Spain with a crucial away goal in the round of 16 tie against Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium in a 1–1 draw.

In the quarter-finals, Raúl scored two goals against Internazionale: one goal in the first leg, a 5–2 away win at the San Siro, and one in the second leg, a 2–1 home win at the Veltins-Arena. Schalke progressed to the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history, where they played against Manchester United. Schalke lost the first match 2–0, which was their first home defeat this season in the tournament, and lost again 4–1 in Old Trafford. Despite the defeat, Raúl considered it an honour that he had swapped shirts with Ryan Giggs. On 19 November 2011, he captained Schalke for the first time due to an injury to Benedikt Höwedes in a 4–0 home win against 1. FC Nürnberg. He also scored the second goal and assisted the fourth in that match.

Raúl scored another hat-trick against Werder Bremen on 17 December 2011. The goals came in a 5–0 win that cemented Schalke&#x27;s position in third place going into the winter break. On 19 February 2012, he scored the 400th goal of his career; at that time he had scored 323 with Real Madrid, 44 with Spain and 33 with Schalke. On 5 April 2012, in the second leg of the UEFA Europa League match against Athletic Bilbao, he scored his 77th goal in a European competition.

With his goal in the semifinals of the German Cup against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, together with his team, he qualified for the final of said competition. His great performances in the European Cup this season earned him to be included in the best eleven of the competition awarded by UEFA.

At a press conference on 19 April 2012, Raúl announced he would leave Schalke after his contract expired in June, and that &quot;[his] future is not in Europe&quot;. Raúl had such an impact at Schalke that, on his departure, the club opted to retire the number 7 shirt for an indefinite period. However, in 2013, the number 7 shirt was given to Max Meyer, Schalke&#x27;s new prodigy.

===Al Sadd===

On 12 May 2012, it was announced Raúl had signed a deal with Qatari Football Club Al Sadd for the 2012–13 Qatar Stars League season. He played his first competitive match for the club on 5 August in the 2012 Sheikh Jassem Cup, scoring a penalty in extra time in order to secure a 2–0 win against Mesaimeer. The veteran also took on the role of captain after Abdulla Koni was substituted. On 13 April 2013, Raúl captained Al Sadd to the 2012–13 Qatar Stars League title. Raúl scored 9 goals in 22 appearances to help Al Sadd win their first title in five years. He scored in the 2013 Emir of Qatar Cup final defeat to Al Rayyan. Raúl was also presented with the post-season QFA-sanctioned Fair Play Award in May 2013, while he had also been shortlisted for QSL Player of the Year award.

On 22 August 2013, Raúl played for Real Madrid in the first half of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu and scored the first goal. He then played the second half for Al Sadd as Real Madrid won 5–0. On 5 March 2014, Raúl announced he would retire from professional football at the end of the Qatari football season.

===New York Cosmos===
On 30 October 2014, Raúl returned to professional football and signed with the New York Cosmos in the United States. He made his North American Soccer League (NASL) debut on 4 April 2015 in a 1–0 win against the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, partially owned by his former Real Madrid strike partner Ronaldo, leaving with a hamstring injury in the second half. The following week, at the Indy Eleven, he scored his first goal to equalise in a 1–1 draw. Raúl scored four times as the undefeated Cosmos won the spring season with five wins and five draws.

On 16 October 2015, it was again announced Raúl would retire at the end of the season. The Cosmos finished with the best regular season record, winning the North American Supporters&#x27; Trophy. On 7 November, he scored the winning goal as his team came from behind to win 2–1 against the Strikers in the semi-finals, earning a place at Soccer Bowl 2015, which they won 3–2 against the Ottawa Fury eight days later. Raúl set up the third and final goal for Gaston Cellerino&#x27;s hat-trick. He reiterated his decision to retire after the Soccer Bowl.

==International career==
Raúl began his Spain career at the youth level and represented the nation at the 1995 FIFA U-20 World Cup, scoring three goals from five matches. He was also part of the under-21 side that reached the final of the 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, and even scored his side&#x27;s temporary equaliser in the final, although he later missed his penalty in the resulting shoot-out, which was won by Italy. In total, he scored 17 goals at the various youth levels for Spain. 

With the senior team, Raúl went on for many years to score a national record 44 goals in 102 caps for Spain. However, David Villa later equaled Raúl&#x27;s record in 2010 and surpassed it on 25 March 2011 in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier. Of his 44 international goals, Raúl scored 32 goals in competitive matches, six of which were in the finals of major tournaments and 12 from friendly matches. He is regarded as one of his nation&#x27;s greatest ever players. 

===1998 FIFA World Cup===
On 9 October 1996, Raúl debuted for the Spanish senior squad against the Czech Republic, playing 90 minutes of a goalless 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification draw at the Letná Stadion in Prague. In his third match on 14 December against Yugoslavia at the Mestalla Stadium, he recorded his first international goal in a 2–0 qualifying victory. At the final tournament in France, Raúl featured in every match as Spain were eliminated from Group D. He scored in their opening match to put them 2–1 up in an eventual 2–3 loss to Nigeria in Nantes.

===UEFA Euro 2000===
On 27 March 1999, in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier, Raúl scored four goals in Spain&#x27;s 9–0 rout of Austria. Four days later, he scored three goals in a 6–0 away win against San Marino during the same qualifying tournament. On 5 June, against the same opponents in Villarreal, he was again on target in a 9–0 rout. Raúl played every minute of Spain&#x27;s Euro 2000 finals campaign in Belgium and the Netherlands. He scored the first goal in their 2–1 win over Slovenia at the Amsterdam Arena. Spain were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual champions France; Raúl missed a last minute penalty which would have taken the tie to extra-time.

===2002 FIFA World Cup===
At the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, Raúl opened a 3–1 win over the Slovenes in Spain&#x27;s first Group B match, and added two more in a 3–2 win over South Africa in Daejeon to advance as group winners. He suffered a groin injury in the round of 16 win over the Republic of Ireland, and missed the remainder of the tournament, in which Spain went out to South Korea in the quarter-finals.

===UEFA Euro 2004===
On 7 September 2002, Raúl scored in a 2–0 away win over Greece in Euro 2004 qualifying, putting him on 29 goals in 56 international games, equalling the national goalscoring record set by the recently retired Fernando Hierro. He broke the record on 12 February 2003 when he scored twice in a 3–1 friendly win over Germany at Son Moix in Palma, Mallorca. He started every match at the Euro 2004 finals in Portugal, in which Spain crashed out at the group stage.

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
Raúl earned his 89th cap on 8 October 2005 in a 2–0 away win over Belgium in 2006 World Cup qualifying, levelling with Hierro as Spain&#x27;s most-capped outfield player. However, he played less frequently across the campaign as new manager Luis Aragonés preferred to partner David Villa and Fernando Torres.

At the final tournament in Germany, he came on at half-time for Luis García in the second group match in Stuttgart, with Spain trailing Tunisia 0–1. When goalkeeper Ali Boumnijel could not retain Cesc Fàbregas&#x27; shot in the 72nd minute, Raúl equalised from close range as Spain eventually won 3–1.

On 15 August 2006, Raúl won his 100th cap for Spain, in a goalless friendly draw with Iceland in Reykjavík. He was last chosen for the national team on 6 September, in a 3–2 defeat against Northern Ireland in Belfast, a match in which he hit the post late on.

==Managerial career==

===Real Madrid U15s===
On 17 August 2018, Raúl was appointed youth coach at Real Madrid, taking charge of the &quot;Cadete B&quot; (under-15) squad.

===Real Madrid Castilla===
On 20 June 2019, he was appointed manager of Real Madrid Castilla. His debut on 25 August was a 1–1 draw at Las Rozas in Segunda División B.

Raúl&#x27;s team made the promotion playoffs in 2021, losing to the seeded Ibiza after a goalless draw in the semi-finals. He then talked down rumours that he would replace his former teammate Zinedine Zidane as first-team manager.

Two years later, Castilla again made the playoffs, in the new Primera Federación. The final against Eldense went to extra time and a 3–3 draw in the second leg, with the team from the Valencian Community winning promotion due to a better regular season finish. Raúl&#x27;s press conference after the game was cancelled for security reasons due to an invasion of the pitch and facilities by celebrating fans of the home team.

==Player profile==

===Style of play===

Raúl is widely regarded as one of the greatest forwards of all time. He wore the number 7 jersey for most of his career and mainly played as a centre-forward. He was also capable of playing as a number 10 behind the forwards. Raúl was a left-footed player who was capable of scoring goals from any distance, and he often scored goals using chips. He possessed excellent ball control, vision, and aerial ability.

Although primarily renowned as a prolific goalscorer, Raúl was also a highly creative and hardworking player that was capable of assisting teammates, and he occasionally played as an attacking midfielder in his later career. 

===Reception===
In addition to these characteristics, Raúl is remembered for his leadership and discipline, as he never received a red card and he was rarely booked. For his speed, elegance, and goalscoring, he was nicknamed &quot;El Ferrari&quot;, or &quot;The Ferrari,&quot; by compatriot Fernando Hierro, another emblematic Real Madrid player. He was also an accurate penalty taker. In 2013, former England centre-back Rio Ferdinand praised Raúl for his clever movement off the ball, and his ability to exploit gaps in defenses, describing him as: &quot;the most intelligent player [he&#x27;d] played against.&quot;

==Media==
Raúl has been sponsored by German sportswear company Adidas. He has advertised Adidas Predator football boots, and in 2004, Adidas made a commercial featuring him and other players on mopeds, including Zinedine Zidane, Michael Ballack, Alessandro Del Piero, and David Trezeguet.

Raúl has featured in Pepsi commercials, including an advertisement for the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, where he and other players including David Beckham, Roberto Carlos, and Gianluigi Buffon took on a team of Sumo players.

Raúl features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series. His regular goal celebration of kissing the ring finger – a show of affection to his wife – appears in &quot;FIFA 18&quot;; because of his celebration, he is also nicknamed &quot;&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==
Raúl married Mamen Sanz in 1999 and the couple have four sons and a daughter: Jorge, Hugo, twins Héctor and Mateo, and María. Jorge and Hugo were both playing football in New York in 2016; Jorge at Fordham Preparatory School, and Hugo in New York City FC&#x27;s academy. In 2022, his daughter Maria was signed by Real Madrid&#x27;s U15 football team.

<doc id="347486" wikidata="Q464506" url="?curid=347486" title="Doc Maynard">
<text>David Swinson &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard (March 22, 1808March 13, 1873) was an American doctor and businessman. He was one of Seattle&#x27;s primary founders. Maynard was Seattle&#x27;s first doctor, merchant prince, second lawyer, Sub-Indian Agent, Justice of the Peace, and architect of the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855.

==Early life==
Maynard was born to a family of means near Castleton, Vermont. At the age of 17 he was accepted into Castleton Medical School (which at the time was associated with Middlebury College). He was top in his class and apprenticed to Dr. Theodore Woodward (not to be confused with Dr. Theodore E. Woodward).

In 1828 he married Lydia A. Rickey; they had a daughter, Frances, in 1830 and a son, Henry, in 1834. According to court papers, he discovered in 1841 that she was unfaithful to him but remained with her until 1850.

In 1832, the Maynards moved to Cleveland, Ohio, at the time a town of 500. He made and lost small fortunes in business and political ventures including railroading and a medical school that collapsed in the Panic of 1837. Maynard left Cleveland in 1850, either promising to send for his family when he was settled elsewhere, or giving Lydia the chance to file for divorce on the grounds of desertion; either way, she never actually completed the divorce.

Maynard took the railroad to St. Louis, and from there set out for California. He circulated among several wagon trains fighting cholera, which he had learned about during the 1849 epidemic in Cleveland. When the leader of one small wagon train heading for Oregon Territory died, he assumed leadership and thus ended up on Puget Sound. He and widow Catherine Troutman Broshears (June 19, 1816 - Oct 20, 1906) fell in love during their journey; however her brother, Mike Simmons, refused them permission to marry, perhaps on the grounds that Maynard was still married.

==Early ventures in Seattle==
Maynard joined in the logging activity at New York-Alki (later Seattle), near the mouth of the Duwamish River on Puget Sound. Instead of selling his wood to shippers at $4 a cord, he leased a vessel from Captain Felker, using the wood itself as security, and sold the load in San Francisco at ten times the price. With that money, he bought the fixings for a general store and briefly set up in competition to the only other such store on Puget Sound, which was in Olympia and owned by Catherine&#x27;s brother. Mike soon agreed to his sister marrying Maynard, apparently on condition that they move the store to Duwamps and do something about that prior marriage.

In April 1852, Maynard claimed, as a married man, a tract of land of 640 acres in what is now Seattle&#x27;s Pioneer Square neighborhood, and hired Indians to help him build a combination cabin and store. According to historian Bill Speidel, the land he preferred was the undeveloped southern part of Carson Boren&#x27;s claim, but while Boren was out of town, Arthur Denny shifted Carson&#x27;s claim north to make room for Maynard. Maynard&#x27;s building became a hub of activity when Maynard became King County&#x27;s first Justice of the Peace.

Maynard laid out streets in his claim according to the cardinal directions (north/south) but Boren and Denny insisted on orienting the streets according to their stretch of shoreline. Seattle&#x27;s downtown still shows awkward bends and jogs where the plats meet, but the rest of King County follows Maynard&#x27;s original design. In reference to the disagreement Arthur Denny would go on to comment that &quot;Maynard was king of all he surveyed, and some of what Boren and I surveyed as well.&quot; In a study conducted by the City of Seattle in the 1930s it was determined that Denny has platted his streets in violation of donation land claim law under which the original land claims were filed.

Doc Maynard&#x27;s character and approach to city-building differed from that of his contemporaries William Bell, Arthur Denny, David Denny, Henry Yesler, and Carson Boren. In part, this may have been because he was much older and had already participated in the development of one city. He drank liquor (while the Denny Party were mostly teetotalers) and, with his friend Captain Felker, found someone to start a good brothel in Seattle — the infamous Mother Damnable — believing that vice was essential to the economic success of a frontier town of that time.

Maynard&#x27;s political skills helped defuse difficult situations with the Indian tribes, in particular between the Duwamish and the more powerful Snohomish, led by Chief Patkanim. As part of his diplomacy, Maynard worked to rename the settlement after the Duwamish&#x27;s leader, Chief Sealth (or &quot;Seattle&quot;) in exchange for an annual payment to Sealth (local legend has it that the tribes believed having one&#x27;s name spoken after their death would disturb the named one in the afterlife; hence the payoff to Sealth to make up for that in advance). This friendly relationship paid off during the Battle of Seattle (1856) when both Sealth and Patkanim kept their fighters out of the battle.

Maynard was one of 44 delegates to attend the Monticello Convention in 1852. His political skills were helpful in drafting a Memorial to Congress persuading the legislature to divide the Oregon Territory and create a separate Washington Territory, north of the Columbia River; in return, the legislature passed an unusual bill granting Maynard a divorce. He married Catherine on January 15, 1853.

Maynard developed many clever ways to improve his property and his city. For example, he obtained the right to host the post office at his store; as a result, everyone had to come to his establishment to get their mail. He sold a lot cheaply to blacksmith Lewis Wyckoff; people needing smithing therefore came to Seattle instead of its rival Port Madison. Perhaps his greatest coup was persuading Henry Yesler to set up a steam sawmill on land sliced from the north part of Maynard&#x27;s claim and the south part of Boren&#x27;s. This sawmill helped establish Seattle&#x27;s economic ascendancy.

When the only lawyer in Seattle died in a canoeing accident, Maynard studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1856. In 1857, Doc Maynard traded his &quot;downtown&quot; acreage for Charles C. Terry&#x27;s farm in West Seattle, but this new enterprise did not prosper; he and Catherine then opened a two-room hospital in what is now Pioneer Square. This enterprise failed because a number of settlers refused to use the hospital after the Maynards insisted on serving both whites and Indians.

==Later life==

Doc Maynard was known as a friend to the Indians; when Washington became a territory in 1853 Doc Maynard was appointed as the man in charge of Indian relations. During the Seattle Indian war Doc Maynard protected the natives and ensured that they did not starve.

Although Maynard was originally one of the city&#x27;s largest landholders and strongest boosters, he is considered not to have prospered as well as his contemporaries. Among the reasons given for this are that his friendly relations with Chief Seattle and other natives made him suspect to his fellow settlers. The surviving city fathers minimized his role in their reminiscences in response to Maynard&#x27;s autocratic rule of early Seattle. At any rate, he died in a mansion furnished with every comfort. It is important to note that Maynard&#x27;s stated purpose was not to get rich but rather to build the greatest city in the world.

Near the end of his life, Maynard&#x27;s first wife Lydia sold any rights she may have had in Maynard&#x27;s property to a person who promptly sued Maynard for Lydia&#x27;s share of Maynard&#x27;s property in Seattle (claiming that they had never been divorced; while he was still married when he built his fortune, the common law is not entirely clear as to her claim). Lydia arrived penniless in Seattle to testify on Maynard&#x27;s behalf; he and Catherine let her stay in their mansion on friendly terms. As Bill Speidel has written, Maynard was seen strolling around town, the only man in Seattle with a wife on either arm.

The ultimate result of this land dispute is that the east half of Maynard&#x27;s claim reverted to public land, as neither of his wives had satisfied their requirements for their share; the legal battle passed through several hands until it was ultimately decided against all the Maynards in the United States Supreme Court case of &quot;Maynard v. Hill&quot;.

<text>Estonians or Estonian people () are a Baltic Finnic ethnic group native to the Baltic region, primarily their nation state of Estonia.

Estonians primarily speak the Estonian language, a language closely related to other Finnic languages, e.g. Finnish, Karelian and Livonian. The Finnic languages are a subgroup of the larger Uralic family of languages, which also includes e.g. the Sami languages. These languages are markedly different from most other native languages spoken in Europe, most of which have been assigned to the Indo-European family of languages. Estonians can also be classified into subgroups according to dialects (e.g. Võros, Setos), although such divisions have become less pronounced due to internal migration and rapid urbanisation in Estonia in the 20th century.

There are approximately 1 million ethnic Estonians worldwide, with the vast majority of them residing in their native Estonia. Estonian diaspora communities formed primarily in Finland, the United States, Sweden, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

==History==

===Prehistoric roots===
Estonia was first inhabited about 10,000 years ago, soon after the ice from the Baltic Ice Lake had melted. Living in the same area for more than 5,000 years would put Estonians&#x27; ancestors among Europe&#x27;s oldest permanent inhabitants. On the other hand, some recent linguistic estimations suggest that Finno-Ugric speakers arrived around the Baltic Sea considerably later, perhaps during the Early Bronze Age (ca. 1800 BCE). It has also been argued that Western Uralic tribes reached Fennoscandia first, leading into the development of the Sámi peoples, and arrived in the Baltic region later in the Bronze Age or the transition to the Iron Age at the latest. This lead into the formation of Baltic Finnic peoples, who would later become such groups as Estonians and Finns.

The oldest known endonym of the Estonians is , literally meaning &quot;land people&quot; or &quot;country folk&quot;. It was used until the mid-19th century, when it was gradually replaced by &quot;Eesti rahvas&quot; &quot;Estonian people&quot; during the Estonian national awakening. &quot;Eesti&quot;, the modern endonym of Estonia, is thought to have similar origins to &quot;Aesti&quot;, the name used by the Germanic peoples for the neighbouring people living northeast of the mouth of the Vistula. The Roman historian Tacitus in 98 CE was the first to mention the &quot;&quot;Aesti&quot; in writing. In Old Norse, the land south of the Gulf of Finland was called &quot;Eistland&quot; and the people &quot;eistr&quot;. The &quot;Wanradt–Koell Catechism&quot;, the first known book in Estonian, was printed in 1525, while the oldest known examples of written Estonian originate in 13th-century chronicles.

===National consciousness===

Although Estonian national consciousness spread in the course of the 19th century during the Estonian national awakening, some degree of ethnic awareness preceded this development. By the 18th century the self-denomination spread among Estonians along with the older . Anton thor Helle&#x27;s translation of the Bible into Estonian appeared in 1739, and the number of books and brochures published in Estonian increased from 18 in the 1750s to 54 in the 1790s. By the end of the century more than a half of adult peasants could read. The first university-educated intellectuals identifying themselves as Estonians, including Friedrich Robert Faehlmann (1798–1850), Kristjan Jaak Peterson (1801–1822) and Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald (1803–1882), appeared in the 1820s. The ruling elites had remained predominantly German in language and culture since the conquest of the early 13th century. Garlieb Merkel (1769–1850), a Baltic-German Estophile, became the first author to treat the Estonians as a nationality equal to others; he became a source of inspiration for the Estonian national movement, modelled on Baltic German cultural world before the middle of the 19th century. However, in the middle of the century, the Estonians became more ambitious and started leaning toward the Finns as a successful model of national movement and, to some extent, toward the neighbouring Latvian national movement. By the end of 1860 the Estonians became unwilling to reconcile with German cultural and political hegemony. Before the attempts at Russification in the 1880s, their view of Imperial Russia remained positive.

Estonians have strong ties to the Nordic countries stemming from important cultural and religious influences gained over centuries during Scandinavian and German rule and settlement. According to a poll done in 2013, about half of the young Estonians considered themselves Nordic, and about the same number viewed Baltic identity as important. The Nordic identity among Estonians can ovelap with other identities, as it is associated with being Finno-Ugric and their close relationship with the Finnish people and does not exclude being Baltic. In Estonian foreign ministry reports from the early 2000s Nordic identity was preferred over Baltic one.

After the Treaty of Tartu (1920) recognised Estonia&#x27;s 1918 independence from Russia, ethnic Estonians residing in Russia gained the option of opting for Estonian citizenship (those who opted were called &quot;optandid&quot; – &#x27;optants&#x27;) and returning to their fatherland. An estimated 40,000 Estonians lived in Russia in 1920. In sum, 37,578 people moved from Soviet Russia to Estonia (1920–1923).

==Emigration==
During the period of Tsarist rule of Estonia (1710-1917), over 100,000 Estonians migrated to the neighbouring areas of the Russian Empire, especially to the then capital city Saint Petersburg. According to the 1897 census, 6,852 native Estonian-speakers also lived in the Russian Partition of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in what is now Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia and western Ukraine, of which over 4,360 lived in territories of today&#x27;s Poland.
During World War II, when Estonia was invaded by the Soviet Army in 1944, large numbers of Estonians fled their homeland on ships or smaller boats over the Baltic Sea. Many refugees who survived the risky sea voyage to Sweden or Germany later moved from there to Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States or Australia. Some of these refugees and their descendants returned to Estonia after the nation regained its independence in 1991.

Over the years of independence, many Estonians have chosen to work abroad, primarily in Finland, but also in the UK, Benelux, Sweden, and Germany. 

Recognising the problems arising from low birth rate and emigration, the Estonian government has launched various measures to increase the birth rate and to lure migrant Estonians back to Estonia. For example, a campaign &quot;Talendid koju!&quot; (&quot;Bringing talents home!&quot;) has aimed to coordinate and promote the return of Estonians who have particular skills needed in Estonia.

===Estonians in Canada===
One of the largest permanent Estonian communities outside Estonia is in Canada, with about 24,000 people (according to some sources up to 50,000 people). In the late 1940s and early 1950s, about 17,000 arrived in Canada, initially in Montreal. Toronto is currently the city with the largest population of Estonians outside of Estonia. The first Estonian World Festival was held in Toronto in 1972. 

== Genetics ==

=== Uniparental haplogroups ===
Y-chromosome haplogroups among Estonians include N1c (35.7%), R1a (33.5%) and I1 (15%). R1a, common in Eastern Europe, was the dominant Y-DNA haplogroup among the pre-Uralic inhabitants of Estonia, as it is the only one found in the local samples from the time of the Corded Ware culture and Bronze Age. Appearance of N1c is linked to the arrival of Uralic-speakers. It originated in East Eurasia and is commonly carried by modern Uralic-speaking groups but also other North Eurasians, including Estonians&#x27; Baltic-speaking neighbors Latvians and Lithuanians. Compared to the Balts, Estonians have been noticed to have differences in allelic variances of N1c haplotypes, showing more similarity with other Finno-Ugric-speakers.

When looking at maternal lineages, nearly half (45 %) of the Estonians have the haplogroup H . About one in four (24.2 %) carry the haplogroup U, and the majority of them belong to its subclade U5. 

=== Autosomal DNA ===
Autosomally Estonians are close with Latvians, Lithuanians and Russians (especially Northwestern Russians). However, they are shifted towards the Finns, who are isolated from most European populations. Northeastern Estonians are particularly close to Finns, while Southeastern Estonians are close to the Balts; other Estonians plot between these two extremes.

Estonians have high steppe-like admixture, and less farmer-related and more hunter-gatherer-related admixture than Western and Central Europeans. The same pattern is found also in the Balts, Finns and Mordvins, for example. Uralic peoples typically carry a Siberian-related component, which is also present in Estonians and makes up about five percent of their ancestry on average. Although they have a smaller share of it than other Balto-Finns, it is one factor that distinguishes them from the Balts. Estonians can also be modelled to have considerably more Finnish-like ancestry than Baltic-speakers.

Estonians have a high sharing of IBD (identity-by-descent) segments with other studied Balto-Finnic groups (Finns, Karelians and Vepsians) and the Sami people, as well as with the Polish people.

<text>The Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club (FCC) in Hong Kong is a members-only club and meeting place for the media, business and diplomatic community. It is located at 2 Lower Albert Road in Central, next to the Hong Kong Fringe Club, and they both occupy the Old Dairy Farm Depot at the top of Ice House Street, one of the few remaining colonial buildings in the Central district.

==History==

The Club was founded in Chongqing in 1943 and moved to Hong Kong from Shanghai, where it was set up on 23 June or 25 June 1949. The Club has been located in several buildings since its inception in Hong Kong. It has occupied the North Block of the Old Dairy Farm Depot since 1982. On 14 August 2018, the Club hosted a lunch talk which pro-independence activist Andy Chan gave a speech. Beijing had tried to block the talk, but the club did not change the plan on ground of freedom of speech. As retaliation, Victor Mallet, the vice-president of FCC, was denied renewal of his visa.

In 2022, the government added a new national security clause to the club&#x27;s lease &quot;to safeguard national security and to sufficiently protect the Government&#x27;s rights and interests.&quot;

==Membership==
The FCC has the following membership categories:

* Correspondent
* Journalist
* Associate (in this category anyone can join although there is a waiting list which can vary from several months to several years)
* Corporate
* Diplomatic

The membership of the FCC (which totals around 2,400) includes foreign correspondents, reporters and members of the business and diplomatic community. The majority of members (around 1,600) are in the associate membership category. Previously it also included the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, but no Chief Executive since Donald Tsang has accepted an offer of membership.

When prominent international figures from the worlds of commerce, politics or entertainment visit Hong Kong, many choose to address the FCC&#x27;s speaker lunches as the best means of reaching their desired audience – both directly and through media coverage of the events. Past speakers include the former chief executive Sir Donald Tsang, former Chief Secretary Mrs Anson Chan. 

==Features==

The heart of the FCC building is The Main Bar (on the ground floor) which maintains its reputation for colourful characters both from the media and other professions. The FCC has two restaurants on the first floor: the Main Dining Room focused primarily on western-style cuisine, and the Chinese Restaurant.

In the basement is Bert&#x27;s Bar, named after the late Bert Okuley, long time FCC member and jazz pianist. Bert&#x27;s features live jazz several nights each week, often with the house band under the leadership of Musical Director 
Allen Youngblood.

The basement also contains The Work Room where local and visiting members can use the broadband-connected facilities to prepare their articles, and a small but well-equipped Health Club with fitness equipment, a sauna and a steam room.

==In popular culture==
* The Club is featured in John le Carré&#x27;s 1977 novel &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot;.
* The FCC has appeared several times in films:
** &quot;Chinese Box&quot; (1997), directed by Wayne Wang. Features the Main Bar.
** &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot; (1955), directed by Henry King. The FCC was located at Conduit Road at that time.
** Series 4, episode 1 of the British television series &quot;Cracker&quot;.

<text>A cubicle is a partially enclosed office workspace that is separated from neighboring workspaces by partitions that are usually tall. Its purpose is to isolate office workers and managers from the sights and noises of an open workspace so that they may concentrate with fewer distractions. Cubicles are composed of modular elements such as walls, work surfaces, overhead bins, drawers, and shelving, which can be configured depending on the user&#x27;s needs. Installation is generally performed by trained personnel, although some cubicles allow configuration changes to be performed by users without specific training.

Cubicles in the 2010s and 2020s are usually equipped with a computer, monitor, keyboard and mouse on the work surface. Cubicles typically have a desk phone. Since many offices use overhead fluorescent lights to illuminate the office, cubicles may or may not have lamps or other additional lighting. Other furniture often found in cubicles includes office chairs and filing cabinets.

The office cubicle was created by designer Robert Propst in Scottsdale, AZ for Herman Miller, and released in 1967 under the name &quot;Action Office II&quot;. Although cubicles are often seen as being symbolic of work in a modern office setting due to their uniformity and blandness, they afford the employee a greater degree of privacy and personalization than in previous work environments, which often consisted of desks lined up in rows within an open room. They do so at a lower cost than individual, private offices. In some office cubicle workspaces, employees can decorate the walls of their cubicle with posters, pictures and other items.

A cubicle is also called a cubicle desk, office cubicle, cubicle workstation, or simply a cube. An office filled with cubicles is sometimes called a sea of cubicles, and additionally called pods (such as 4-pod or 8-pod of cubes) or a cube farm. Although humorous, the phrase usually has negative connotations. Cube farms are found in multiple industries including technology, insurance, and government offices.

== Etymology ==
The term cubicle comes from the Latin &quot;cubiculum&quot;, for bed chamber. It was used in English as early as the 15th century. It eventually came to be used for small chambers of all sorts, and for small rooms or study spaces with partitions which do not reach to the ceiling. Like the older carrel desk, a cubicle seeks to give a degree of privacy to the user while taking up minimal space in a large or medium-sized room. 

A satirical joke in the 1870 edition of &quot;Punch, or the London Charivari&quot; magazine uses &quot;cubicle&quot; in the context of an advertisement for a college dormitory - &quot;The dormitories separate cubicles.&quot; The joke appears to ridicule the overly studious word, asking, &quot;But stay, what &quot;is&quot; a cubicle? Did we ever sleep in a cubicle? No; we should as soon have thought of slumber in a bicycle.&quot; The article goes on to explain the Latin origin of the word &quot;cubicle&quot; and its definition.

In 1879, the word &quot;cubicle&quot; appeared in reference to electrical engineering, referring to what is today known as electrical enclosures for switchgears and circuit breakers.

==History==
Prior to the widespread adoption of cubicles beginning in the 1960s, office workers often worked at desks arranged in rows in an open room, where they were exposed to the sounds and activity of those working around them.

=== Action Office I ===

In 1960, Herman Miller created the Herman Miller Research Corporation under the supervision of George Nelson. The corporation&#x27;s first major project was an evaluation of the &quot;office&quot; as it had evolved during the 20th Century, and in particular, how it functioned in the 1960s. 

Propst concluded from his studies that during the 20th century the office environment had changed substantially, particularly in relation to the amount of information being processed. The amount of information an employee had to analyze, organize, and maintain had increased dramatically. Despite this, the basic layout of the corporate office had remained largely unchanged, with employees sitting behind rows of traditional desks in a large open room, devoid of privacy. Propst&#x27;s studies suggested that an open environment actually reduced communication between employees, and impeded personal initiative. On this, Propst commented &quot;One of the regrettable conditions of present day offices is the tendency to provide a formula kind of sameness for everyone.&quot; In addition, the employees&#x27; bodies were suffering from long hours of sitting in one position. Propst concluded that office workers require both privacy and interaction, depending on which of their many duties they were performing.

In 1964, Propst and the Research Corporation developed a plan, which Nelson&#x27;s office executed in the form of the Action Office I (AO-1), and introduced it in the Herman Miller lineup. AO-1 featured desks and workspaces of varying height which allowed the worker a freedom of movement, and to assume the work position best suited for the task. AO-1 was ideally suited to small professional offices in which managers and employees often interacted using the same furnishings, but wasn&#x27;t suitable for large corporation offices. In addition, it was expensive and difficult to assemble. Despite its shortcomings, Nelson won the Alcoa Award for the design, neglecting to mention Propst&#x27;s contribution.

=== First appearances ===
The first offices to incorporate the &quot;Action Office&quot; design were in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which contracted with George Nelson and Herman Miller in 1963 to design an innovative office space that could maximize efficiency in a small area. The result was based on Nelson&#x27;s CPS (Comprehensive Panel System), and featured &quot;pods&quot; of four cubicles arranged in a swastika pattern, each with an L-shaped desk and overhead storage. Surviving photos of the Federal Reserve Bank offices reveal a design that would not appear much different from a cubicle of today. In 1964 this design was re-used for the Women&#x27;s Medical Clinic of Lafayette, Indiana. Nelson also used the design in his own New York design offices.

===Action Office II===
Following the poor sales of Action Office 1, Propst and Nelson decided that Action Office I had failed. For several years, Propst and Nelson fought over a disagreement on the work environment best suited to the employee of a corporate office, and Nelson was eventually taken off the project. Nelson&#x27;s departure left Propst free to indulge in his concept of an office capable of constant change to suit the changing needs of the employee, without having to purchase new furnishings, and allowing the employee a degree of privacy, and the ability to personalize the work environment without impacting the environment of the workers nearby. Propst recognized that people are more productive within a territorial enclave that they can personalize, but also that they require vistas outside their space. Propst&#x27;s concept was the &quot;back-up&quot;, a two- or three-sided vertical division that defined territory and afforded privacy without hindering the ability to view or participate in surrounding activities.

The unit also supported multiple workstation furnishings, which benefited from the vertically oriented work-space. The AO-2 lineup met with unprecedented success, and other manufacturers quickly copied it. In 1978, &quot;Action Office II&quot; was renamed simply &quot;Action Office&quot;, and by 2005 had attained sales totaling $5 billion.

Despite the success and his contributing ideas, Nelson criticized the &quot;Action Office II&quot; line. In 1970, he sent a letter to Robert Blaich, Herman Miller&#x27;s Vice-President for Corporate Design and Communication, in which he described the system&#x27;s &quot;dehumanizing effect as a working environment.&quot;.

=== Internet era ===
In 1994 designer Douglas Ball planned and built several iterations of the Clipper or CS-1, a &quot;capsule&quot; desk that resembled the streamlined front fuselage of a fighter plane. Meant as a computer workstation, it had louvers and an integrated ventilation system, as well as a host of built-in features typical of the ergonomic desk. An office space filled with these instead of traditional squarish cubicles would look like a hangar filled with small flight simulators. It was selected for the permanent design collection of the Design Museum in the United Kingdom.

Many cube farms were built during the dotcom boom of 1997-2003. Between 2000 and 2002, IBM partnered with the office furniture manufacturer Steelcase, and researched the software, hardware, and ergonomic aspects of the cubicle of the future (or the office of the future) under the name &quot;Bluespace&quot;. They produced several prototypes of this hi-tech multi screened work space and even exhibited one at Walt Disney World. Bluespace offered movable multiple screens inside and outside, a projection system, advanced individual lighting, heating and ventilation controls, and guest-detecting privacy systems.

=== Open-plan offices ===

During the 2000s and 2010s, open plan offices arose again as a modern response to cubicles, inspired by tech companies in Silicon Valley. Though they predate cubicles and were re-popularized by architects including Frank Lloyd Wright in 1939, 21st-century open plans are sometimes described as a &quot;fad.&quot; Open plans have negative consequences on employees&#x27; productivity, mental health, and health. 

In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, open-plan offices such as those in True Manufacturing Co. began to put up plexiglass partitions. Demand was so high and materials scarce the use of glass partitions as a protective screen was also widely used - essentially, once again dividing open plans into cubicles.

==Impact on society==

It is unlikely that any other office furnishings has had as much of a social impact as the introduction of the office cubicle in the 1960s, though the outcome of the cubicle&#x27;s arrival is still open to debate. 

Author Thomas Hine speculated that the cubicle contributed to breaking the glass ceiling for women in the 1960s. Because women could be excluded from male-dominated open office &quot;bull pens,&quot; cubicles allowed women to be promoted into middle management positions without making men uncomfortable.

Writer Geoffrey James of &quot;Inc.&quot; is also a proponent of cubicles. James argues that cubicles encourage diversity in the workplace, as opposed to open floor plans which he claims favors the socially privileged and creates an uncomfortable environment for others. Therefore, he claims open floor spaces systemically encourage ageism, racism, sexism, and ableism by focusing on young white men as the norm. However, cubicles lead to more overall comfort and therefore more equality in the workplace. 

Cultural commentary about cubicles was done in the 1990s and early 2000s. In expensive cities like New York and London, open-floor plans became popular because traditional cubicle or office setups were too costly. In 1989, controversial cartoonist Scott Adams spoke through his comic strip, &quot;Dilbert&quot;, to satirize cubicle culture. He depicted an IT company employee who works in a cubicle. In 2001, he teamed up with the design company IDEO to create &quot;Dilbert&#x27;s Ultimate Cubicle&quot;. It included both whimsical aspects, a modular approach and attention to usually-neglected ergonomic details like the change in light orientation as the day advances. 

In 1991, Douglas Coupland has coined the phrase &quot;veal-fattening pen&quot;, a deprecation of cubicles in his novel &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture&quot;. In 1999, cubicles were depicted in sci-fi movie &quot;The Matrix&quot;, in which a programmer who is moonlighting as a hacker spends his days in a drab cubicle. The 1999 comedy &quot;Office Space&quot; depicts a bored group of IT workers who work in cubicles.

<text>The Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia (; ) is a self-governing body of the Eastern Orthodox Church that territorially covers the countries of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The current primate of the Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church is Rastislav of Prešov (born Ondrej Gont), Metropolitan of the Czech Lands and Slovakia since 2014.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
The Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia presents both an ancient history as well as a very modern history. The present-day church occupies the land of Great Moravia, where the brothers Ss. Cyril and Methodius began their mission to the Slavs, introducing the liturgical and canonical order of the Eastern Orthodox Church, translated into Church Slavonic, using mostly Greek calques to explain concepts for which no Slavic term existed. In doing this they developed the first Slavic alphabet, a mixture of Greek and Hebrew-based characters with a few invented characters of their own to represent unique Slavic sounds.

This was done at the express invitation of the powerful ruler Rastislav of Moravia. Yet within the Moravian state there was a Frankish party among the nobility who desired closer ties with East Francia, whose ruler, Louis the German, was Ratislav&#x27;s nominal suzerain, and a Frankish bishop had ecclesiastical jurisdiction over a small part of Ratislav&#x27;s domain that had earlier converted to Christianity. Despite the Photian Schism, the churches of Rome and Constantinople still preserved some semblance of unity, and Pope Nicholas I did not want to see the formation of a large independent Frankish church in Central Europe. When an appeal of the ecclesiastical issue was made to Rome, Nicholas summoned both Cyril and Methodius and the complaining Frankish parties to his court to hear them out. Nicholas died before their arrival, but the new Pope Adrian II reached a compromise after hearing both sides: Old Church Slavonic was confirmed as a liturgical language alongside Greek, Hebrew and Latin, and Methodius was confirmed as bishop with a Frankish co-adjutor, Wiching. Adrian was convinced by Cyril&#x27;s impassioned defence of the Slavic liturgy in which he cited 1 Corinthians 14:19 &quot;Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.&quot; Cyril fell ill while the brothers were still at Rome, and on his deathbed he asked Methodius to swear to return to Moravia and complete the mission to the Slavs instead of returning to the monastic life on Mount Olympus as he had intended to do.

Methodius kept his word and returned, but his mission was interrupted by the death of Ratislav, as the new ruler, Svatopluk I of Moravia sided with the pro-Frankish party and had Methodius imprisoned for almost three years, until he was freed through the intercession of Pope John VIII. For the next ten years, Methodius continued his work, but the death of John VIII in 882 removed his papal protection, and Methodius died in 885. After this, Pope Stephen V of Rome confirmed his Swabian co-adjutor Wiching as bishop. Methodius&#x27;s disciples were imprisoned, expelled to Bulgaria, like Gorazd and many others, or enslaved. The expelled, led by Clement of Ohrid and Naum of Preslav, were of great importance to the Eastern Orthodox faith in the already Christian from year 864 Bulgaria, after they were released from prison and escorted to the Danube. In AD 870 the Fourth Council of Constantinople granted the Bulgarians the right to have the oldest organized autocephalous Slavic Orthodox Church that little later, from autonomous Bulgarian archbishopric, became patriarchate. A major event that strengthened the process of Christianization was the development of the Cyrillic script in Bulgaria at the founding by Naum and Clement of the Preslav Literary School in the 9th century. The Cyrillic script and the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic were declared official in Bulgaria in 893.

=== Survival and revival ===

The Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical order survived in present-day eastern Slovakia and neighboring regions due to its nearness and influence to Kievan Rus&#x27;, especially among the population of the Rusins, until the middle of the 17th century when the Union of Uzhhorod was brought about in the Kingdom of Hungary. During the times of suppression, remaining Eastern Orthodox Christians from the region kept their ties with neighboring Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Buda of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć and later with the Metropolitanate of Karlovci. One of the most northern parishes of the Serbian Orthodox Church existed in the Slovak city of Komárno with local church built in the 18th century still standing today.

After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, legal restraints to Eastern Orthodoxy were removed. In the new state, Eastern Orthodox communities were mainly located in the eastern parts of the country, including Carpatho-Rus&#x27; that was incorporated into Czechoslovakia in 1919. In that region, the city of Mukachevo was located with its traditions going back to the old Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Mukachevo, that existed before the Union of Uzhhorod. In the spirit of Eastern Orthodox revival, many people in the region left the Uniate (Greek Catholic) Church. Since there were no Eastern Orthodox bishops in Czechoslovakia, local leaders looked to the Serbian Orthodox Church because Serbs were historically and ethnically close to the Czechs, Slovaks and Rusins. That view was also supported by state authorities of Czechoslovakia (1920). In order to regulate the ecclesiastical order, Bishop Dositej Vasić of Niš (Serbia) arrived in Prague and met with leaders of Eastern Orthodox community, receiving them into full communion (1921).

Among those seeking to restore ties with Eastern Orthodox Church was a Catholic priest Matěj Pavlík, who had been interested in Eastern Orthodoxy for years. The Serbian Orthodox Church thus consented to receive him in full communion and he became Archimandrite with the name Gorazd, in honor of Saint Gorazd of Moravia, disciple and successor of Saint Methodius, Archbishop of Moravia. On September 25, 1921, Archimandrite Gorazd was consecrated Bishop of Moravia and Silesia at the Cathedral of the Holy Archangel Michael in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, by Serbian Patriarch Dimitrije. Bishop Gorazd received jurisdiction over Czech Lands.

As the Orthodox leader in the new nation of Czechoslovakia, Bishop Gorazd laid the foundations of the Orthodox Church throughout Bohemia, Moravia, and also into Slovakia. In Bohemia, he oversaw the building of eleven churches and two chapels. He also published the essential books for the conduct of church services that were translated into Czech. He provided aid to those in Slovakia and Carpatho-Rus&#x27;, which then was part of Czechoslovakia, and who wanted to return to Eastern Orthodox Faith from the Unia, Union with Rome. Thus, in the inter-war period, Bishop Gorazd built the small Czech church that during World War II would show how firmly it was connected to the Czech nation.

By 1931, Eastern Orthodox renewal in eastern Slovakia and Carpatho-Rus&#x27; was progressing very well, allowing the creation of the second Diocese that was named: Eparchy of Mukačevo and Prešov. That diocese was also created under the auspices of the Serbian Orthodox Church. First bishop of Mukachevo and Prešov was Damaskin Grdanički. In 1938, he was succeeded by Bishop Vladimir Rajić.

In 1938, Nazi Germany succeeded in annexing the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia during the Munich Conference. In the same year, after the First Vienna Award, southern parts of Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia were annexed by Hungary. Since the city of Mukačevo was taken by Hungary, bishop Vladimir had to move to the city of Khust. In 1939, Nazi Germany annexed the remainder of the Czech lands into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and installed a pro-Nazi regime in Slovakia. At the same time, Hungary occupied the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia and in 1941 Hungarian authorities arrested bishop Vladimir Rajić and deported him back to Serbia.

Years of Nazi occupation (1938/9-1944/5) were marked by renewed restrictions and persecutions. By 1942, Reinhard Heydrich, architect of the Final Solution, had become governor of the Czech Protectorate. After the May 27, 1942 assassination attack on Heydrich&#x27;s car in Prague, Czech and Slovak partisans took refuge in the crypt of the Ss. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral before continuing their escape. They were aided by senior church laymen, who kept Bishop Gorazd informed. However, their presence was discovered by the Nazis, and on June 18 the Nazis attacked their hiding place in the cathedral, forcing them to commit suicide. The Orthodox priests, laymen, and Bishop Gorazd were arrested and killed by firing squads on September 4, 1942.

In reprisal the Nazis forbade the church to operate in Bohemia and Moravia. Churches and chapels were closed, and a rounding up of Czechs was conducted, including the whole village of Lidice, whose inhabitants were either killed or sent to forced labor camps. For the Orthodox the whole church fell under the Nazi persecution and was decimated. A total of 256 Orthodox priests and laymen were executed, and church life came to a stop.

===Post-War developments===

In 1945, after the incorporation of Carpatho-Rus&#x27; by the USSR as Zakarpattia Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR, eastern parts of the Eparchy of Mukačevo and Prešov were transferred from the jurisdiction of Serbian Orthodox Church to the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church, and on that territory a new Eparchy of Mukačevo and Užgorod was formed, while the western part of the diocese remained in Czechoslovakia and was reorganized as the Eparchy of Prešov.

After World War II, the Orthodox Church in Czechoslovakia began its recovery without its bishop. On December 9, 1951, the Patriarch of Moscow granted autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Czechoslovakia, recognized by nearly all Orthodox local churches, though this action was not recognized by Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, who made claims to jurisdiction, regarding the Czechoslovak church as being autonomous under its authority. The Patriarch of Constantinople later issued a &quot;tomos&quot;, or official proclamation, of autocephaly in 1998.

When the Communists came to power in April 1950, the government convoked a synod of the Slovak Greek Catholic Church in Prešov, where five priests and a large number of laymen signed a document declaring that the union with Rome was disbanded and asking to be received into the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate, later the Orthodox Church of Czechoslovakia. Greek Catholic faithfuls and clergy were presented with the choice of remaining in union with Rome and becoming Latin-rite Catholics or keeping their Byzantine rite and become Orthodox. The government transferred control of the Greek Catholic churches and other property to the Orthodox Church.

During the Prague Spring in 1968, the former Greek Catholic parishes were allowed to restore communion with Rome. As a result of anti-Russian sentiment, of the 292 parishes involved, 205 voted in favor. This was one of the few reforms by Dubček that survived the Soviet invasion the same year. However, most of church buildings remained in the hands of Orthodox Church as they had originally been built as Orthodox churches and/or the congregations of these churches had in large measure voted to have their parishes placed under the omophorion of the Orthodox Church in 1950. After communism was overthrown in the 1989 Velvet Revolution, most of the Church property was returned to the Slovak Greek Catholic Church by 1993.

The martyrdom of Bishop Gorazd was recognized by the Serbian Orthodox Church on May 4, 1961, which canonized Gorazd as a New Martyr. Subsequently, on August 24, 1987, he was canonized at the Cathedral of St. Gorazd in Olomouc, Moravia.

Archbishop Rastislav of Prešov was elected by the Extraordinary Synod held on January 11, 2014, as the new primate. On December 9, 2013, the Synod removed Archbishop Simeon (Jakovlevic) of Brno and Olomouc from his position as &quot;Locum Tenens&quot; (&quot;ad interim&quot; administrator following the resignation of the previous primate, Archbishop Krystof, over allegations of sexual relations with women), and appointed Archbishop Rastislav in his place, an action against which Archbishop Simeon protested and which was deplored by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, who had supported Krystof.

== Administration ==
After Czechoslovakia separated in 1993, church activities continued in each new country as separate legal entities: in the Czech Republic as the Orthodox Church in the Czech Lands and in the Slovak Republic as the Orthodox Church in Slovakia, with canonical unity maintained as the Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia. The church is now organized into four eparchies divided into two administrative centers: the Metropolitan Council for the Czech Republic resident in Prague, and the Metropolitan Council for the Slovak Republic in Prešov. Under the Council of the Czech Lands (Prague) are the eparchies of Prague and Olomouc-Brno, while the eparchies of Prešov and Michalovce are under the Council of Slovakia (Prešov).

After the death of Metropolitan Dorotheus of Prague and All Czechoslovakia, Archbishop Nicholas of Prešov was elected the new metropolitan, and the church&#x27;s primatial see was moved from Prague to Prešov. Metr. Nicholas reposed (died) on January 30, 2006, and succeeded by Archbishop Christopher of Prague and the Czech Lands since May 2, 2006.

In the Czech Republic, there are 82 parishes: 51 in Bohemia and 31 in Moravia and Silesia. In Slovakia, there are 90 parishes: 69 in the eparchy of Prešov and 21 in the eparchy of Michalovce. The Orthodox Theological Faculty of the University of Prešov functions as a seminary for future priests of combined Church, with a satellite campus in Olomouc.

The Monastery of Saint Procopius of Sazava is located in Most, and the Monastery of the Dormition of the Theotokos in Vilémov.

The current primate of the Czechoslovak Orthodox Church is (born Ondrej Gont), Metropolitan of the Czech Lands and Slovakia since 2014.

<text>Rodney Cline Carew (born October 1, 1945) is a Panamanian-American former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a second baseman, first baseman and designated hitter from 1967 to 1985 for the Minnesota Twins and the California Angels. The most accomplished contact hitter in Twins history, he won the 1977 AL Most Valuable Player Award, setting a Twins record with a .388 batting average. Carew appeared in 18 consecutive All-Star Games and led the AL in hits three times, with his 239 hits in ranking as the 12th most in a season at the time and the 16th most as of 2024, tied with Willie Keeler’s 239 hits from . He won seven AL batting titles, the second most AL batting titles in history behind Ty Cobb, and on July 12, 2016, the AL batting title was renamed to the Rod Carew American League batting title.

In 1977, Carew was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award for his involvement in local community affairs. On August 4, 1985, he became the 16th member of the 3,000 hit club with a single to left field off Frank Viola. His 3,053 hits are 27th all time, and his career batting average of .328 is 34th all time. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991 in his first year of eligibility; he appeared on upwards of 90 percent of the ballots. He was also elected to the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame, Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame, and Angels Hall of Fame. After retiring as a player, Carew served as a coach for the Angels and the Milwaukee Brewers.

==Early life==
Carew is the son of Olga Teoma, and Eric Carew Sr., a painter. Carew is a Zonian and was born to a Panamanian mother on a train in the town of Gatún, which, at that time, was in the Panama Canal Zone. The train was racially segregated; white passengers were given the better forward cars, while non-whites, like Carew&#x27;s mother, were forced to ride in the rearward cars. Traveling on the train was Dr. Rodney Cline, who delivered the baby. In appreciation for this, Mrs. Carew named the boy Rodney Cline Carew. Carew later acknowledged in 2020 that he and his father Eric had a very tumultuous relationship, even stating &quot;Baseball was the one thing that kept me from killing my father.&quot; In his memoir &quot;One Tough Out&quot;, Carew stated that his father was a violent alcoholic who would often physically abuse him and his mother, and that Carew eventually came close to killing him with a machete.

At age 14, Carew and his siblings immigrated to the United States to join his mother in the Washington Heights section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City. Although Carew attended George Washington High School, he never played baseball for the high school team. According to Carew, his interest in baseball redeveloped at the age of 18; as when he was younger and still in Panama, his mother convinced him he could get away from his father if he played baseball. Carew later played semi-professional baseball for the Bronx Cavaliers, which is where he was discovered by Minnesota Twins scout Monroe Katz (whose son, Steve, played with Carew on the Cavaliers). Katz then recommended Carew to another Twins scout, Herb Stein, who arranged a tryout in April 1964, and Carew performed so well that manager Sam Mele finished the tryout early so that the Yankees would not see him. Herb Stein along with Katz signed Carew to an amateur free agent contract (at the Stella D&#x27;Oro Restaurant in the Bronx) on June 24, 1964 for a monthly salary of $400 ().

Starting his minor league career, Carew was assigned to play second base with the Melbourne Twins in the Cocoa Rookie League and hit .325 over the final 37 games of the season. Over the next two years he would end up hitting .302 in Class A playing second base for the Wilson Tobs and the Orlando Twins.

==Major league career==
===Minnesota Twins===
In the top of the second inning on April 11, 1967, at Memorial Stadium against the Baltimore Orioles, Carew hit a single for his first major league hit in his first plate appearance, he would finish the game going 2–4. A few weeks later against the Washington Senators, Carew went 5–5 with a double and a stolen base for the first 5–hit game of his career. He was elected to the first of his 18 consecutive All-Star game appearances, and won the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year award receiving 19 of 20 first place votes. In a game against the Detroit Tigers at Metropolitan Stadium on May 18, 1969, Cesar Tovar led off the bottom of the third with a single. With Carew at bat, pitcher Mickey Lolich balked and Tovar moved to second base, then stole third. Carew walked, then executed a double steal with Tovar as Tovar stole home and Carew stole second. Carew then stole third base, followed by a steal of home. This marked the 41st time in Major League history and the 20th time in AL history that a runner had stolen every base in an inning. Carew stole home seven times in 1969, leading the major leagues in this category and just missing Ty Cobb&#x27;s record of eight. Carew&#x27;s seven steals of home in 1969 was the most in the majors since Pete Reiser stole seven for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946. Manager Billy Martin had worked with Carew throughout the 1969 season to learn how to steal home, and teammate Sandy Valdespino had taught Carew how to bunt more effectively, at the end of the season he led the AL with a .332 batting average, the second-place finisher, Reggie Smith, had a .309 average.
Carew had hit for the cycle on May 20, 1970, against the Kansas City Royals, going 4–5 with a stolen base, this was the first cycle hit by a member of the Twins. Later that year, on June 22, he was injured at second base attempting to convert a double play, he had surgery to repair ligaments in his left leg, and missed 92 games. In 1972, Carew led the AL in batting, hitting .318; he had no home runs for the only time in his career. This was the first time since 1918, when Zack Wheat won the National League batting championship, that a player won the batting title with no home runs.

The start of the 1973 season was slow, Carew was only hitting .246 by the end of April. Carew performed well during the summer months, including a 5-hit performance on August 14. By the end of September he was back in the major league lead with a .353 average. When the season concluded he won his third batting title, with a major league leading .350 batting average. His 203 hits and 11 triples also led the AL. The next season, Carew had his best year to date, from his first at bat on April 5, against the Kansas City Royals, he never batted below .300 for the entire year. Through June 27, he was batting .400 but cooled off near the end of the season. His 213 hits were a career-high, and led the majors, and he collected his fourth career batting title with a .364 batting average.

In 1975, Carew won his fourth consecutive AL batting title. He joined Ty Cobb as the only players to lead the major leagues in batting average for three consecutive seasons. Seeing time predominantly at second base early in his career, Carew moved to first base in September 1975 and stayed there for the rest of his career. Carew missed out on winning another batting title in 1976 as his .331 average was only .002 behind the league leader George Brett. Carew still collected career highs in stolen bases, games played and triples, and had 200 hits for the third time in his career.

In the 1977 season, Carew batted .388, which was the highest since Boston&#x27;s Ted Williams hit .388 in 1957; he won the 1977 AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. He also set career highs with 239 hits (at that time the most by any player since 1930), 100 RBIs and 128 runs scored. In the summer of 1977, Carew appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; with the caption &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Best Hitter&quot;. He won his seventh and final batting title in 1978 when he hit .333. He had finished in the top 15 in AL MVP voting in every season between 1972 and 1978.

===California Angels===

In 1979, allegedly frustrated by the Twins&#x27; inability to keep young talent, some racist comments by Calvin Griffith, and the Twins&#x27; overall penny-pinching negotiating style, Carew announced his intention to leave the Twins. On February 3, Carew was traded to the Angels for outfielder Ken Landreaux, catcher/first baseman Dave Engle, right-handed pitcher Paul Hartzell, and left-handed pitcher Brad Havens. Although it would have represented an infusion of talent, the Twins were unable to complete a possibly better deal with the New York Yankees in January in which Carew would have moved to the Yankees in exchange for Chris Chambliss, Juan Beníquez, Dámaso García, and Dave Righetti. In 2020, Carew denied the longtime allegations that the controversial comments which Griffith made in 1978 suggesting support for Minnesota having a low African-American population and the idea that blacks preferred wrestling to baseball was what triggered his trade to the Angels when he stated, &quot;When he traded me prior to the 1979 season, Calvin told me he wanted me to be paid what I was worth. Later that year the Angels made me the highest paid player in baseball. A racist wouldn&#x27;t have done that.&quot;

Though Carew did not win a batting title after 1978, he hit between .305 and .339 from 1979 to 1983. In 1982, Carew broke his hand early in the season. Newspaper reports characterized him as swinging one-handed that season due to pain, but he put together a 25-game hitting streak at one point in the season. He played in 138 games that year and hit .319. The Angels went to the playoffs in 1982, which was Carew&#x27;s fourth and final appearance in postseason play. The team lost a five-game series (three games to two) to the Milwaukee Brewers. Carew played in all five games, but he hit .176 (three hits in 17 at-bats). Carew grounded out to end the fifth and final game by hitting a routine groundball to shortstop Robin Yount off a pitch from Pete Ladd, a minor-league journeyman who replaced the injured Brewers closer Rollie Fingers.

On August 4, 1985, Carew joined an elite group of ballplayers when he got his 3,000th base hit against Minnesota Twins left-hander Frank Viola at the former Anaheim Stadium. The 1985 season was his last. After the season, Rod Carew was granted free agency, after the Angels declined to offer him a new contract. He received an offer from the Boston Red Sox to be their minor league hitting instructor. His only offer to continue his playing career in 1986 was from the San Francisco Giants. He declined the offer and opted to retire. Carew suspected that baseball owners were colluding to keep him (and other players) from signing. On January 10, 1995, nearly a decade after his forced retirement, arbitrator Thomas Roberts ruled that the owners had violated the rules of baseball&#x27;s second collusion agreement. Carew was awarded damages equivalent to what he would have likely received in 1986: $782,035.71. Carew finished his career with 3,053 hits and a lifetime batting average of .328.

Through 2017, Carew still holds many places in the Twins record books, including: highest career batting average (.334), second-highest on-base percentage (.393, tied with Buddy Myer), fourth-highest in intentional walks (99), fifth in hits (2,085), and fifth in stolen bases (271). He also holds many spots in the Angels record books, including: highest career on-base percentage (.393), second-highest batting average (.314), and sixth-highest in both intentional walks (45) and sacrifice hits (60). Carew&#x27;s career total of 17 steals of home ties him for 17th on the all-time MLB list with former New York Giant MVP Larry Doyle and fellow Hall of Famer Eddie Collins.

===Career statistics===
In 2,469 games over 19 seasons, Carew posted a .328 batting average (3,053-for-9,315) with 1,424 runs, 445 doubles, 112 triples, 92 home runs, 1,015 RBI, 353 stolen bases, 1,018 bases on balls, .393 on-base percentage and .429 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .985 fielding percentage playing at first and second base. In 14 ALCS games, he hit .220 (11-for-50) with 6 runs, 4 doubles, 1 RBI, 2 stolen bases and 5 walks. He also had a batting average of .300 or higher in 15 consecutive seasons (1969-1983). Carew recorded 7 five-hit games and 51 four-hit games in his 19-year MLB career. Carew was also an effective pinch hitter in his career, recording a .315 batting average (40-for-127) with 3 home runs and 33 RBI in that role.

==Outside baseball==

===Military service===
During the 1960s, Carew served a six-year commitment in the United States Marine Corps Reserve as a combat engineer. He later said that his military experience helped him in his baseball career. Carew said, &quot;When I joined the Marine Corps, it was a life-changing event for me because I learned about discipline. When I first came up to the big leagues in 1967, I was a little bit of a hothead. But after two weeks of war games every summer, I realized that baseball was not do-or-die. That kind of discipline made me the player I became.&quot;

===Confusion over conversion to Judaism===
There is no evidence that Carew ever formally converted to Judaism, although he wore a chai necklace during his playing days. His first wife, Marilynn Levy, is Jewish, and he was a member of Temple Beth Shalom in Santa Ana, California. Their three daughters, Charryse, Stephanie, and Michelle, were raised in the Jewish tradition and had their bat mitzvahs there. When one daughter, Michelle, died of leukemia at age 18, services were held at Beth Shalom, and she was buried in the family plot at the United Hebrew Brotherhood Cemetery in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, where Rod Carew played for the Minnesota Twins. Carew, however, still identified as Episcopalian during their relationship.

A 2007 &quot;Salon&quot; article named Carew one of the 18 best Jewish ballplayers of all time; the article clarified that Carew was not Jewish but commended him for raising his children in the faith and for marrying Levy in spite of death threats he received. Carew and Levy, who began their relationship in 1968, were married in 1970 and divorced in 2000.

Another source propagating the story is &quot;The Chanukah Song&quot;, written and performed by Adam Sandler in 1994. The tune (which quickly became a holiday perennial) lists famous Jews of the 20th century: &quot;...O. J. Simpson... not a Jew! But guess who is: Hall of Famer Rod Carew! He converted!&quot; Carew later wrote Sandler and explained the situation, adding that he thought the song was &quot;pretty funny&quot;. (Sandler dropped Carew from later versions of the song, but Neil Diamond mentions the ballplayer in his rendition, recorded in 2009.)

==After retirement==
Carew moved to the community of Anaheim Hills, California, while playing with the Angels and remained there after his retirement. Carew was hired as the Angels&#x27; hitting coach on November 5, 1991, and served in a similar capacity with the Milwaukee Brewers. He is credited with helping develop young hitters like Garret Anderson, Jim Edmonds, and Tim Salmon. Carew has also worked at various times as a minor league and spring training hitting and base running coach for the Twins and serves as an international youth baseball instructor for Major League Baseball.

Carew married his second wife Rhonda in December 2001; she has two children, Cheyenne and Devon. Devout Christians, the family attends Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California.

On January 19, 2004, Panama City&#x27;s National Stadium was renamed &quot;Rod Carew Stadium&quot;. In 2005, Carew was named the second baseman on the Major League Baseball Latino Legends Team.

Carew&#x27;s number 29 was retired by the Twins on July 19, 1987, and by the Angels in 1986. Carew was the fourth inductee into the Angels&#x27; Hall of Fame on August 6, 1991. Carew was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991, his first year of eligibility, the 22nd player so elected; he went into the Hall with a Twins cap. In 1999, he ranked #61 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for Major League Baseball&#x27;s All-Century Team. Carew was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2010.
Carew has three biological children from his first marriage—Charryse, Stephanie, and Michelle. In September 1995, his youngest of three daughters, Michelle, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a relatively rare leukemia for a young person. Doctors wanted to perform a bone marrow transplant, but Michelle&#x27;s rare ethnic heritage complicated the search for a matching donor; her father was black with West Indian and Panamanian roots and her mother was of Russian-Jewish ancestry. Carew pleaded for those of similar ethnic background to come forward. When no matching bone marrow donor was found, an umbilical cord blood transplant was performed in March 1996. Michelle died on April 17, 1996, at the age of 18. A statue of her has been installed in Angel Stadium of Anaheim.

Carew began using chewing tobacco in 1964 and was a regular user up to 1992, when a cancerous growth in his mouth was discovered and removed. The years of use had severely damaged his teeth and gums, and Carew has spent a reported $100,000 in restorative dental work.

In September 2015, Carew suffered a massive heart attack while on a California golf course. He was hospitalized for more than six weeks, and had several surgical procedures, which culminated with implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Carew recovered sufficiently to take part in the Twins&#x27; 2016 spring training as an instructor, coach, and launch the &quot;Heart of 29&quot; Campaign. Further, Carew became involved in the branding and launching of a Left Ventricular Assist Device wear company, Carew Medical Wear. In February 2016, Carew indicated that his doctors informed him that he would eventually need a heart transplant. The transplant was done on December 15, 2016. Carew&#x27;s transplanted heart was donated by former Baltimore Ravens tight end Konrad Reuland. Reuland had attended middle school with Carew&#x27;s children and was inspired by Carew to become a professional athlete in elementary, after meeting him as a child. Reuland later became a high school athlete in baseball, as well as basketball and football. Carew participated in the 2018 Rose Parade aboard the Donate Life float on New Year&#x27;s Day, in honor of Reuland.

In a pre-game ceremony before the 2016 MLB All Star Game in San Diego, the American League batting championship trophy was named the &quot;Rod Carew American League Batting Championship Award&quot;.

In 2016, Rod Carew was awarded the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award.

On August 23, 2024, Carew became a citizen of the United States.

<text>The Critique of Pure Reason (; 1781; second edition 1787) is a book by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, in which the author seeks to determine the limits and scope of metaphysics. Also referred to as Kant&#x27;s &quot;First Critique&quot;, it was followed by his &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; (1788) and &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; (1790). In the preface to the first edition, Kant explains that by a &quot;critique of pure reason&quot; he means a critique &quot;of the faculty of reason in general, in respect of all knowledge after which it may strive &quot;independently of all experience&quot;&quot; and that he aims to decide on &quot;the possibility or impossibility of metaphysics&quot;.

Kant builds on the work of empiricist philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume, as well as rationalist philosophers such as René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Christian Wolff. He expounds new ideas on the nature of space and time, and tries to provide solutions to the skepticism of Hume regarding knowledge of the relation of cause and effect and that of René Descartes regarding knowledge of the external world. This is argued through the transcendental idealism of objects (as appearance) and their form of appearance. Kant regards the former &quot;as mere representations and not as things in themselves&quot;, and the latter as &quot;only sensible forms of our intuition, but not determinations given for themselves or conditions of objects as things in themselves&quot;. This grants the possibility of a priori knowledge, since objects as appearance &quot;must conform to our cognition...which is to establish something about objects before they are given to us.&quot; Knowledge independent of experience Kant calls &quot;&quot;a priori&quot; knowledge, while knowledge obtained through experience is termed &quot;a posteriori&quot;&quot;. According to Kant, a proposition is &quot;a priori&quot; if it is necessary and universal. A proposition is necessary if it is not false in any case and so cannot be rejected; rejection is contradiction. A proposition is universal if it is true in all cases, and so does not admit of any exceptions. Knowledge gained &quot;a posteriori&quot; through the senses, Kant argues, never imparts absolute necessity and universality, because it is possible that we might encounter an exception.

Kant further elaborates on the distinction between &quot;analytic&quot; and &quot;synthetic&quot; judgments. A proposition is analytic if the content of the &quot;predicate-concept&quot; of the proposition is already contained within the &quot;subject-concept&quot; of that proposition. For example, Kant considers the proposition &quot;All bodies are extended&quot; analytic, since the predicate-concept (&#x27;extended&#x27;) is already contained within—or &quot;thought in&quot;—the subject-concept of the sentence (&#x27;body&#x27;). The distinctive character of analytic judgments was therefore that they can be known to be true simply by an analysis of the concepts contained in them; they are true by definition. In synthetic propositions, on the other hand, the predicate-concept is not already contained within the subject-concept. For example, Kant considers the proposition &quot;All bodies are heavy&quot; synthetic, since the concept &#x27;body&#x27; does not already contain within it the concept &#x27;weight&#x27;. Synthetic judgments therefore add something to a concept, whereas analytic judgments only explain what is already contained in the concept.

Before Kant, philosophers held that all &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge must be analytic. Kant, however, argues that our knowledge of mathematics, of the first principles of natural science, and of metaphysics, is both &quot;a priori&quot; and synthetic. The peculiar nature of this knowledge cries out for explanation. The central problem of the &quot;Critique&quot; is therefore to answer the question: &quot;How are synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; judgments possible?&quot; It is a &quot;matter of life and death&quot; to metaphysics and to human reason, Kant argues, that the grounds of this kind of knowledge be explained.

Though it received little attention when it was first published, the &quot;Critique&quot; later attracted attacks from both empiricist and rationalist critics, and became a source of controversy. It has exerted an enduring influence on Western philosophy, and helped bring about the development of German idealism. The book is considered a culmination of several centuries of early modern philosophy and an inauguration of late modern philosophy.

==Background==

=== Early rationalism ===
Before Kant, it was generally held that truths of reason must be analytic, meaning that what is stated in the predicate must already be present in the subject (e.g., &quot;An intelligent man is intelligent&quot; or &quot;An intelligent man is a man&quot;). In either case, the judgment is analytic because it is ascertained by analyzing the subject. It was thought that all truths of reason, or necessary truths, are of this kind: that in all of them there is a predicate that is only part of the subject of which it is asserted. If this were so, attempting to deny anything that could be known &quot;a priori&quot; (e.g., &quot;An intelligent man is not intelligent&quot; or &quot;An intelligent man is not a man&quot;) would involve a contradiction. It was therefore thought that the law of contradiction is sufficient to establish all &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge.

David Hume at first accepted the general view of rationalism about &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge. However, upon closer examination of the subject, Hume discovered that some judgments thought to be analytic, especially those related to cause and effect, were actually synthetic (i.e., no analysis of the subject will reveal the predicate). They thus depend exclusively upon experience and are therefore &quot;a posteriori&quot;.

=== Kant&#x27;s rejection of Hume&#x27;s empiricism ===
Before Hume, rationalists had held that effect could be deduced from cause; Hume argued that it could not and from this inferred that nothing at all could be known &quot;a priori&quot; in relation to cause and effect. Kant, who was brought up under the auspices of rationalism, was deeply impressed by Hume&#x27;s skepticism. &quot;I freely admit that it was the remembrance of David Hume which, many years ago, first interrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my investigations in the field of speculative philosophy a completely different direction.&quot;

Kant decided to find an answer and spent at least twelve years thinking about the subject. Although the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; was set down in written form in just four to five months, while Kant was also lecturing and teaching, the work is a summation of the development of Kant&#x27;s philosophy throughout those twelve years.

Kant&#x27;s work was stimulated by his decision to take seriously Hume&#x27;s skeptical conclusions about such basic principles as cause and effect, which had implications for Kant&#x27;s grounding in rationalism. In Kant&#x27;s view, Hume&#x27;s skepticism rested on the premise that all ideas are presentations of sensory experience. The problem that Hume identified was that basic principles such as causality cannot be derived from sense experience only: experience shows only that one event regularly succeeds another, not that it is caused by it.

In section VI (&quot;The General Problem of Pure Reason&quot;) of the introduction to the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, Kant explains that Hume stopped short of considering that a synthetic judgment could be made &#x27;a priori&#x27;. Kant&#x27;s goal was to find some way to derive cause and effect without relying on empirical knowledge. Kant rejects analytical methods for this, arguing that analytic reasoning cannot tell us anything that is not already self-evident, so his goal was to find a way to demonstrate how the synthetic a priori is possible.

To accomplish this goal, Kant argued that it would be necessary to use synthetic reasoning. However, this posed a new problem: how is it possible to have synthetic knowledge that is not based on empirical observation; that is, how are synthetic a priori truths possible? This question is exceedingly important, Kant maintains, because he contends that all important metaphysical knowledge is of synthetic a priori propositions. If it is impossible to determine which synthetic a priori propositions are true, he argues, then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible.

==Synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; judgments==
Kant argues that there are synthetic judgments such as the connection of cause and effect (e.g., &quot;... Every effect has a cause.&quot;) where no analysis of the subject will produce the predicate. Kant reasons that statements such as those found in geometry and Newtonian physics are synthetic judgments. Kant uses the classical example of 7 + 5 = 12. No amount of analysis will find 12 in either 7 or 5 and vice versa, since an infinite number of two numbers exist that will give the sum 12. Thus Kant concludes that all pure mathematics is synthetic though &quot;a priori&quot;; the number 7 is seven and the number 5 is five and the number 12 is twelve and the same principle applies to other numerals; in other words, they are universal and necessary. For Kant then, mathematics is synthetic judgment &quot;a priori&quot;. Conventional reasoning would have regarded such an equation to be analytic a priori by considering both 7 and 5 to be part of one subject being analyzed, however Kant looked upon 7 and 5 as two separate values, with the value of five being applied to that of 7 and synthetically arriving at the logical conclusion that they equal 12. This conclusion led Kant into a new problem as he wanted to establish how this could be possible: How is pure mathematics possible? This also led him to inquire whether it could be possible to ground synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge for a study of metaphysics, because most of the principles of metaphysics from Plato through to Kant&#x27;s immediate predecessors made assertions about the world or about God or about the soul that were not self-evident but which could not be derived from empirical observation (B18-24). For Kant, all post-Cartesian metaphysics is mistaken from its very beginning: the empiricists are mistaken because they assert that it is not possible to go beyond experience and the dogmatists are mistaken because they assert that it is possible to go beyond experience through theoretical reason.

Therefore, Kant proposes a new basis for a science of metaphysics, posing the question: how is a science of metaphysics possible, if at all? According to Kant, only practical reason, the faculty of moral consciousness, the moral law of which everyone is immediately aware, makes it possible to know things as they are. This led to his most influential contribution to metaphysics: the abandonment of the quest to try to know the world as it is &quot;in itself&quot; independent of sense experience. He demonstrated this with a thought experiment, showing that it is not possible to meaningfully conceive of an object that exists outside of time and has no spatial components and is not structured following the categories of the understanding (&quot;Verstand&quot;), such as substance and causality. Although such an object cannot be conceived, Kant argues, there is no way of showing that such an object does not exist. Therefore, Kant says, the science of metaphysics must not attempt to reach beyond the limits of possible experience but must discuss only those limits, thus furthering the understanding of ourselves as thinking beings. The human mind is incapable of going beyond experience so as to obtain a knowledge of ultimate reality, because no direct advance can be made from pure ideas to objective existence.

Kant writes: &quot;Since, then, the receptivity of the subject, its capacity to be affected by objects, must necessarily precede all intuitions of these objects, it can readily be understood how the form of all appearances can be given prior to all actual perceptions, and so exist in the mind &quot;a priori&quot;&quot; (A26/B42). Appearance is then, via the faculty of transcendental imagination (&quot;Einbildungskraft&quot;), grounded systematically in accordance with the categories of the understanding. Kant&#x27;s metaphysical system, which focuses on the operations of cognitive faculties (&quot;Erkenntnisvermögen&quot;), places substantial limits on knowledge not found in the forms of sensibility (&quot;Sinnlichkeit&quot;). Thus it sees the error of metaphysical systems prior to the Critique as failing to first take into consideration the limitations of the human capacity for knowledge. Transcendental imagination is described in the first edition of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; but Kant omits it from the second edition of 1787.

It is because he takes into account the role of people&#x27;s cognitive faculties in structuring the known and knowable world that in the second preface to the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; Kant compares his critical philosophy to Copernicus&#x27; revolution in astronomy. Kant (Bxvi) writes: Hitherto it has been assumed that all our knowledge must conform to objects. But all attempts to extend our knowledge of objects by establishing something in regard to them &quot;a priori&quot;, by means of concepts, have, on this assumption, ended in failure. We must therefore make trial whether we may not have more success in the tasks of metaphysics, if we suppose that objects must conform to our knowledge.Kant&#x27;s view is that in explaining the movement of celestial bodies, Copernicus rejected the idea that the movement is only in the stars in order to allow that such movement is also due to the motion of ourselves as spectators. Thus, the Copernican revolution in astronomy shifted our understanding of the universe from one that is geocentric, without reference to the motion of ourselves as spectators, to one that is heliocentric with reference to the motion of ourselves as spectators. Likewise, Kant aims to shift metaphysics from one that requires our understanding to conform to the nature of objects to one that requires the objects of experience to conform to the necessary conditions of our knowledge. Consequently, knowledge does not depend solely on the object of knowledge but also on the capacity of the knower.

=== Transcendental idealism ===
Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism should be distinguished from idealistic systems such as that of George Berkeley which deny all claims of extramental existence and consequently turn phenomenal objects into things-in-themselves. While Kant claimed that phenomena depend upon the conditions of sensibility, space and time, and on the synthesizing activity of the mind manifested in the rule-based structuring of perceptions into a world of objects, this thesis is not equivalent to mind-dependence in the sense of Berkeley&#x27;s idealism. Kant defines &quot;transcendental idealism&quot;:

==Kant&#x27;s approach==
In Kant&#x27;s view, &quot;a priori&quot; intuitions and concepts provide some &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge, which also provides the framework for &quot;a posteriori&quot; knowledge. Kant also believed that causality is a conceptual organizing principle imposed upon nature, albeit nature understood as the sum of appearances that can be synthesized according to a priori concepts.

In other words, space and time are a form of perceiving and causality is a form of knowing. Both space and time and conceptual principles and processes pre-structure experience.

Things as they are &quot;in themselves&quot;—the thing in itself, or —are unknowable. For something to become an object of knowledge, it must be experienced, and experience is structured by the mind—both space and time being the forms of intuition (&quot;Anschauung&quot;; for Kant, intuition is the process of sensing or the act of having a sensation) or perception, and the unifying, structuring activity of concepts. These aspects of mind turn things-in-themselves into the world of experience. There is never passive observation or knowledge.

According to Kant, the transcendental ego—the &quot;Transcendental Unity of Apperception&quot;—is similarly unknowable. Kant contrasts the transcendental ego to the empirical ego, the active individual self subject to immediate introspection. One is aware that there is an &quot;I,&quot; a subject or self that accompanies one&#x27;s experience and consciousness. Since one experiences it as it manifests itself in time, which Kant proposes is a subjective form of perception, one can know it only indirectly: as object, rather than subject. It is the empirical ego that distinguishes one person from another providing each with a definite character.

==Contents==
The &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; is arranged around several basic distinctions. After the two Prefaces (the A edition Preface of 1781 and the B edition Preface of 1787) and the Introduction, the book is divided into the Doctrine of Elements and the Doctrine of Method.

=== Doctrine of Elements and of Method ===
The Doctrine of Elements sets out the &quot;a priori&quot; products of the mind, and the correct and incorrect use of these presentations. Kant further divides the Doctrine of Elements into the Transcendental Aesthetic and the Transcendental Logic, reflecting his basic distinction between sensibility and the understanding. In the &quot;Transcendental Aesthetic&quot; he argues that space and time are pure forms of intuition inherent in our faculty of sense. The &quot;Transcendental Logic&quot; is separated into the Transcendental Analytic and the Transcendental Dialectic:
* The Transcendental Analytic sets forth the appropriate uses of &quot;a priori&quot; concepts, called &quot;the categories&quot;, and other principles of the understanding, as conditions of the possibility of a science of metaphysics. The section titled the &quot;Metaphysical Deduction&quot; considers the origin of the &quot;categories&quot;. In the &quot;Transcendental Deduction&quot;, Kant then shows the application of the &quot;categories&quot; to experience. Next, the &quot;Analytic of Principles&quot; sets out arguments for the relation of the &quot;categories&quot; to metaphysical principles. This section begins with the &quot;Schematism&quot;, which describes how the imagination can apply pure concepts to the object given in sense perception. Next are arguments relating the &quot;a priori&quot; principles with the schematized &quot;categories&quot;.
* The Transcendental Dialectic describes the transcendental illusion behind the misuse of these principles in attempts to apply them to realms beyond sense experience. Kant’s most significant arguments are the &quot;Paralogisms of Pure Reason&quot;, the &quot;Antinomy of Pure Reason&quot;, and the &quot;Ideal of Pure Reason&quot;, aimed against, respectively, traditional theories of the soul, the universe as a whole, and the existence of God. In the Appendix to the &quot;Critique of Speculative Theology&quot; Kant describes the role of the transcendental ideas of reason.

The Doctrine of Method contains four sections. The first section, &quot;Discipline of Pure Reason&quot;, compares mathematical and logical methods of proof, and the second section, &quot;Canon of Pure Reason&quot;, distinguishes theoretical from practical reason.

==I. Transcendental Doctrine of Elements==

===Transcendental Aesthetic===
The Transcendental Aesthetic, as the &quot;Critique&quot; notes, deals with &quot;all principles of a priori sensibility.&quot; As a further delimitation, it &quot;constitutes the first part of the transcendental doctrine of elements, in contrast to that which contains the principles of pure thinking, and is named transcendental logic&quot;. In it, what is aimed at is &quot;pure intuition and the mere form of appearances, which is the only thing that sensibility can make available a priori.&quot; It is thus an analytic of the a priori constitution of sensibility; through which &quot;Objects are therefore given to us..., and it alone affords us intuitions.&quot; This in itself is an explication of the &quot;pure form of sensible intuitions in general [that] is to be encountered in the mind a priori.&quot; Thus, pure form or intuition is the a priori &quot;wherein all of the manifold of appearances is intuited in certain relations.&quot; from this, &quot;a science of all principles of a priori sensibility [is called] the transcendental aesthetic.&quot; The above stems from the fact that &quot;there are two stems of human cognition...namely sensibility and understanding.&quot;

This division, as the critique notes, comes &quot;closer to the language and the sense of the ancients, among whom the division of cognition into αισθητα και νοητα is very well known.&quot; An exposition on a priori intuitions is an analysis of the intentional constitution of sensibility. Since this lies a priori in the mind prior to actual object relation; &quot;The transcendental doctrine of the senses will have to belong to the first part of the science of elements, since the conditions under which alone the objects of human cognition are given precede those under which those objects are thought&quot;.

Kant distinguishes between the matter and the form of appearances. The matter is &quot;that in the appearance that corresponds to sensation&quot; (A20/B34). The form is &quot;that which so determines the manifold of appearance that it allows of being ordered in certain relations&quot; (A20/B34). Kant&#x27;s revolutionary claim is that the form of appearances—which he later identifies as space and time—is a contribution made by the faculty of sensation to cognition, rather than something that exists independently of the mind. This is the thrust of Kant&#x27;s doctrine of the transcendental ideality of space and time.

Kant&#x27;s arguments for this conclusion are widely debated among Kant scholars. Some see the argument as based on Kant&#x27;s conclusions that our representation (&quot;Vorstellung&quot;) of space and time is an &quot;a priori&quot; intuition. From here Kant is thought to argue that our representation of space and time as &quot;a priori&quot; intuitions entails that space and time are transcendentally ideal. It is undeniable from Kant&#x27;s point of view that in Transcendental Philosophy, the difference of things as they appear and things as they are is a major philosophical discovery. Others see the argument as based upon the question of whether synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; judgments are possible. Kant is taken to argue that the only way synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; judgments, such as those made in geometry, are possible is if space is transcendentally ideal.

In Section I (Of Space) of Transcendental Aesthetic in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; Kant poses the following questions: What then are time and space? Are they real existences? Or, are they merely relations or determinations of things, such, however, as would equally belong to these things in themselves, though they should never become objects of intuition; or, are they such as belong only to the form of intuition, and consequently to the subjective constitution of the mind, without which these predicates of time and space could not be attached to any object? The answer that space and time are real existences belongs to Newton. The answer that space and time are relations or determinations of things even when they are not being sensed belongs to Leibniz. Both answers maintain that space and time exist independently of the subject&#x27;s awareness. This is exactly what Kant denies in his answer that space and time belong to the subjective constitution of the mind.

====Space and time====
Kant gives two expositions of space and time: &quot;metaphysical&quot; and &quot;transcendental&quot;. The metaphysical expositions of space and time are concerned with clarifying how those intuitions are known independently of experience. The transcendental expositions purport to show how the metaphysical conclusions give insight into the possibility of already obtained &quot;a priori&quot; scientific knowledge (A25/B40).

In the transcendental exposition, Kant refers back to his metaphysical exposition in order to show that the sciences would be impossible if space and time were not kinds of pure &quot;a priori&quot; intuitions. He asks the reader to take the proposition, &quot;two straight lines can neither contain any space nor, consequently, form a figure,&quot; and then to try to derive this proposition from the concepts of a straight line and the number two. He concludes that it is simply impossible (A47-48/B65). Thus, since this information cannot be obtained from analytic reasoning, it must be obtained through synthetic reasoning, i.e., a synthesis of concepts (in this case two and straightness) with the pure (&quot;a priori&quot;) intuition of space.

In this case, however, it was not experience that furnished the third term; otherwise, the necessary and universal character of geometry would be lost. Only space, which is a pure &quot;a priori&quot; form of intuition, can make this synthetic judgment, thus it must then be &quot;a priori&quot;. If geometry does not serve this pure &quot;a priori&quot; intuition, it is empirical, and would be an experimental science, but geometry does not proceed by measurements—it proceeds by demonstrations.

The other part of the Transcendental Aesthetic argues that time is a pure &quot;a priori&quot; intuition that renders mathematics possible. Time is not a concept, since otherwise it would merely conform to formal logical analysis (and therefore, to the principle of non-contradiction). However, time makes it possible to deviate from the principle of non-contradiction: indeed, it is possible to say that A and non-A are in the same spatial location if one considers them in different times, and a sufficient alteration between states were to occur (A32/B48). Time and space cannot thus be regarded as existing in themselves. They are &quot;a priori&quot; forms of sensible intuition.

The current interpretation of Kant states that the subject possesses the capacity to perceive spatial and temporal presentations &quot;a priori&quot;. The Kantian thesis claims that in order for the subject to have any experience at all, then it must be bounded by these forms of presentations (&quot;Vorstellung&quot;). Some scholars have offered this position as an example of psychological nativism, as a rebuke to some aspects of classical empiricism.

Kant&#x27;s thesis concerning the transcendental ideality of space and time limits appearances to the forms of sensibility—indeed, they form the limits within which these appearances can count as sensible; and it necessarily implies that the thing-in-itself is neither limited by them nor can it take the form of an appearance within us apart from the bounds of sensibility (A48-49/B66). Yet the thing-in-itself is held by Kant to be the cause of that which appears, and this is where an apparent paradox of Kantian critique resides: while we are prohibited from knowledge of the thing-in-itself, we can attribute it as being something beyond ourselves as a causally responsible source of representations within us. Kant&#x27;s view of space and time rejects both the space and time of Aristotelian physics and the space and time of Newtonian physics.

===Transcendental Logic===

In the Transcendental Logic, there is a section (titled The Refutation of Idealism) that is intended to free Kant&#x27;s doctrine from any vestiges of subjective idealism, which would either doubt or deny the existence of external objects (B274-79). Kant&#x27;s distinction between the appearance and the thing-in-itself is not intended to imply that nothing knowable exists apart from consciousness, as with subjective idealism. Rather, it declares that knowledge is limited to phenomena as objects of a sensible intuition. In the Fourth Paralogism (&quot;... A Paralogism is a logical fallacy&quot;), Kant further certifies his philosophy as separate from that of subjective idealism by defining his position as a &quot;transcendental idealism&quot; in accord with empirical realism (A366–80), a form of direct realism. &quot;The Paralogisms of Pure Reason&quot; is the only chapter of the &quot;Dialectic&quot; that Kant rewrote for the second edition of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. In the first edition, the Fourth Paralogism offers a defence of transcendental idealism, which Kant reconsidered and relocated in the second edition.

Whereas the Transcendental Aesthetic was concerned with the role of the sensibility, the Transcendental Logic is concerned with the role of the understanding, which Kant defines as the faculty of the mind that deals with concepts. Knowledge, Kant argued, contains two components: intuitions, through which an object is given to us in sensibility, and concepts, through which an object is thought in understanding. In the Transcendental Aesthetic, he attempted to show that the &quot;a priori&quot; forms of intuition were space and time, and that these forms were the conditions of all possible intuition. It should therefore be expected that we should find similar &quot;a priori&quot; concepts in the understanding, and that these pure concepts should be the conditions of all possible thought. The Logic is divided into two parts: the Transcendental Analytic and the Transcendental Dialectic. The Analytic Kant calls a &quot;logic of truth&quot;; in it he aims to discover these pure concepts which are the conditions of all thought, and are thus what makes knowledge possible. The Transcendental Dialectic Kant calls a &quot;logic of illusion&quot;; in it he aims to expose the illusions that we create when we attempt to apply reason beyond the limits of experience.

The idea of a transcendental logic is that of a logic that gives an account of the origins of our knowledge as well as its relationship to objects. Kant contrasts this with the idea of a general logic, which abstracts from the conditions under which our knowledge is acquired, and from any relation that knowledge has to objects. According to Helge Svare, &quot;It is important to keep in mind what Kant says here about logic in general, and transcendental logic in particular, being the product of abstraction, so that we are not misled when a few pages later he emphasizes the pure, non-empirical character of the transcendental concepts or the categories.&quot;

Kant&#x27;s investigations in the Transcendental Logic lead him to conclude that understanding and reason can only legitimately be applied to things as they appear phenomenally to us in experience. What things are in themselves as being noumenal, independent of our cognition, remains limited by what is known through phenomenal experience.

====First Division: Transcendental Analytic====
The Transcendental Analytic is divided into an Analytic of Concepts and an Analytic of Principles, as well as a third section concerned with the distinction between phenomena and noumena. In Chapter III (Of the ground of the division of all objects into phenomena and noumena) of the Transcendental Analytic, Kant generalizes the implications of the Analytic in regard to transcendent objects preparing the way for the explanation in the Transcendental Dialectic about thoughts of transcendent objects, Kant&#x27;s detailed theory of the content (&quot;Inhalt&quot;) and origin of our thoughts about specific transcendent objects. The main sections of the Analytic of Concepts are The Metaphysical Deduction and The Transcendental Deduction of the Categories. The main sections of the Analytic of Principles are the Schematism, Axioms of Intuition, Anticipations of Perception, Analogies of Experience, Postulates and follow the same recurring tabular form:

In the 2nd edition, these sections are followed by a section titled the Refutation of Idealism.

=====The metaphysical deduction=====
In the Metaphysical Deduction, Kant aims to derive twelve pure concepts of the understanding (which he calls &quot;categories&quot;) from the logical forms of judgment. In the following section, he will go on to argue that these categories are conditions of all thought in general. Kant arranges the forms of judgment in a &quot;table of judgments&quot;, which he uses to guide the derivation of the &quot;table of categories&quot;.

The role of the understanding is to make judgments. In judgment, the understanding employs concepts which apply to the intuitions given to us in sensibility. Judgments can take different logical forms, with each form combining concepts in different ways. Kant claims that if we can identify all of the possible logical forms of judgment, this will serve as a &quot;clue&quot; to the discovery of the most basic and general concepts that are employed in making such judgments, and thus that are employed in all thought.

Logicians prior to Kant had concerned themselves to classify the various possible logical forms of judgment. Kant, with only minor modifications, accepts and adopts their work as correct and complete, and lays out all the logical forms of judgment in a table, reduced under four heads:

Under each head, there corresponds three logical forms of judgment:

This Aristotelian method for classifying judgments is the basis for his own twelve corresponding concepts of the understanding. In deriving these concepts, he reasons roughly as follows. If we are to possess pure concepts of the understanding, they must relate to the logical forms of judgment. However, if these pure concepts are to be applied to intuition, they must have content. But the logical forms of judgment are by themselves abstract and contentless. Therefore, to determine the pure concepts of the understanding we must identify concepts which &quot;both&quot; correspond to the logical forms of judgment, &quot;and&quot; are able to play a role in organising intuition. Kant therefore attempts to extract from each of the logical forms of judgment a concept which relates to intuition. For example, corresponding to the logical form of &quot;hypothetical&quot; judgment (&#x27;If &quot;p&quot;, then &quot;q&quot;&#x27;), there corresponds the category of causality (&#x27;If one event, then another&#x27;). Kant calls these pure concepts &#x27;categories&#x27;, echoing the Aristotelian notion of a category as a concept which is not derived from any more general concept. He follows a similar method for the other eleven categories, then represents them in the following table:

These categories, then, are the fundamental, primary, or native concepts of the understanding. These flow from, or constitute the mechanism of understanding and its nature, and are inseparable from its activity. Therefore, for human thought, they are universal and necessary, or &quot;a priori&quot;. As categories they are not contingent states or images of sensuous consciousness, and hence not to be thence derived. Similarly, they are not known to us independently of such consciousness or of sensible experience. On the one hand, they are exclusively involved in, and hence come to our knowledge exclusively through, the spontaneous activity of the understanding. This understanding is never active, however, until sensible data are furnished as material for it to act upon, and so it may truly be said that they become known to us &quot;only on the occasion of sensible experience&quot;. For Kant, in opposition to Christian Wolff and Thomas Hobbes, the categories exist only in the mind.

These categories are &quot;pure&quot; conceptions of the understanding, in as much as they are independent of all that is contingent in sense. They are not derived from what is called the &quot;matter&quot; of sense, or from particular, variable sensations. However, they are not independent of the universal and necessary form of sense. Again, Kant, in the &quot;Transcendental Logic&quot;, is professedly engaged with the search for an answer to the second main question of the Critique: How is pure physical science, or sensible knowledge, possible? Kant, now, has said, and, with reference to the kind of knowledge mentioned in the foregoing question, has said truly, that &quot;thoughts, without the content which perception supplies, are empty&quot;. This is not less true of &quot;pure&quot; thoughts, than of any others. The content which the pure conceptions, as categories of pure physical science or sensible knowledge, cannot derive from the matter of sense, they must and do derive from its pure form. And in this relation between the pure conceptions of the understanding and their pure content there is involved, as we shall see, the most intimate community of nature and origin between sense, on its formal side (space and time), and the understanding itself. For Kant, space and time are &quot;a priori&quot; intuitions. Out of a total of six arguments in favor of space as &quot;a priori&quot; intuition, Kant presents four of them in the Metaphysical Exposition of space: two argue for space &quot;a priori&quot; and two for space as intuition.

=====The transcendental deduction=====
In the Transcendental Deduction, Kant aims to show that the categories derived in the Metaphysical Deduction are conditions of all possible experience. He achieves this proof roughly by the following line of thought: all representations must have some common ground if they are to be the source of possible knowledge (because extracting knowledge from experience requires the ability to compare and contrast representations that may occur at different times or in different places). This ground of all experience is the self-consciousness of the experiencing subject, and the constitution of the subject is such that all thought is rule-governed in accordance with the categories. It follows that the categories feature as necessary components in any possible experience.

=====The schematism=====
In order for any concept to have meaning, it must be related to sense perception. The 12 categories, or &quot;a priori&quot; concepts, are related to phenomenal appearances through schemata. Each category has a schema. It is a connection through time between the category, which is an &quot;a priori&quot; concept of the understanding, and a phenomenal &quot;a posteriori&quot; appearance. These schemata are needed to link the pure category to sensed phenomenal appearances because the categories are, as Kant says, heterogeneous with sense intuition. Categories and sensed phenomena, however, do share one characteristic: time. Succession is the form of sense impressions and also of the Category of causality. Therefore, time can be said to be the schema of Categories or pure concepts of the understanding.

=====The refutation of idealism=====
In order to answer criticisms of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; that Transcendental Idealism denied the reality of external objects, Kant added a section to the second edition (1787) titled &quot;The Refutation of Idealism&quot; which turns the &quot;game&quot; of idealism against itself by arguing that self-consciousness presupposes external objects. Defining self-consciousness as a determination of the self in time, Kant argues that all determinations of time presuppose something permanent in perception and that this permanence cannot be in the self, since it is only through the permanence that one&#x27;s existence in time can itself be determined. This argument inverted the supposed priority of inner over outer experience that had dominated philosophies of mind and knowledge since René Descartes. In Book II, chapter II, section III of the Transcendental Analytic, right under &quot;The Postulates of Empirical Thought&quot;, Kant adds a &quot;Refutation of Idealism (&quot;Widerlegung des Idealismus&quot;)&quot;, where he refutes both Descartes&#x27; problematic idealism and Berkeley&#x27;s dogmatic idealism. According to Kant, in problematic idealism the existence of objects is doubtful or impossible to prove, while in dogmatic idealism the existence of space and therefore of spatial objects is impossible. In contradistinction, Kant holds that external objects may be directly perceived and that such experience is a necessary presupposition of self-consciousness.

=====Appendix: &quot;Amphiboly of Concepts of Reflection&quot;=====
As an Appendix to the First Division of Transcendental Logic, Kant intends the &quot;Amphiboly of the Conceptions of Reflection&quot; to be a critique of Leibniz&#x27;s metaphysics and a prelude to Transcendental Dialectic, the Second Division of Transcendental Logic. Kant introduces a whole set of new ideas called &quot;concepts of reflection&quot;: identity/difference, agreement/opposition, inner/outer and matter/form. According to Kant, the categories do have but these concepts have no synthetic function in experience. These special concepts just help to make comparisons between concepts judging them either different or the same, compatible or incompatible. It is this particular action of making a judgment that Kant calls &quot;logical reflection.&quot; As Kant states: &quot;Through observation and analysis of appearances we penetrate to nature&#x27;s inner recesses, and no one can say how far this knowledge may in time extend. But with all this knowledge, and even if the whole of nature were revealed to us, we should still never be able to answer those transcendental questions which go beyond nature. The reason of this is that it is not given to us to observe our own mind with any other intuition than that of inner sense; and that it is yet precisely in the mind that the secret of the source of our sensibility is located. The relation of sensibility to an object and what the transcendental ground of this [objective] unity may be, are matters undoubtedly so deeply concealed that we, who after all know even ourselves only through inner sense and therefore as appearance, can never be justified in treating sensibility as being a suitable instrument of investigation for discovering anything save always still other appearances eager as we yet are to explore their non-sensible cause.&quot; (A278/B334)

====Second Division: Transcendental Dialectic====
Following the systematic treatment of a priori knowledge given in the transcendental analytic, the transcendental dialectic seeks to dissect dialectical illusions. Its task is effectively to expose the fraudulence of the non-empirical employment of the understanding. The Transcendental Dialectic shows how pure reason should not be used. According to Kant, the rational faculty is plagued with dialectic illusions as man attempts to know what can never be known.

This longer but less dense section of the Critique is composed of five essential elements, including an Appendix, as follows: (a) Introduction (to Reason and the Transcendental Ideas), (b) Rational Psychology (the nature of the soul), (c) Rational Cosmology (the nature of the world), (d) Rational Theology (God), and (e) Appendix (on the constitutive and regulative uses of reason).

In the introduction, Kant introduces a new faculty, human reason, positing that it is a unifying faculty that unifies the manifold of knowledge gained by the understanding. Another way of thinking of reason is to say that it searches for the &#x27;unconditioned&#x27;; Kant had shown in the Second Analogy that every empirical event has a cause, and thus each event is conditioned by something antecedent to it, which itself has its own condition, and so forth. Reason seeks to find an intellectual resting place that may bring the series of empirical conditions to a close, to obtain knowledge of an &#x27;absolute totality&#x27; of conditions, thus becoming unconditioned. All in all, Kant ascribes to reason the faculty to understand and at the same time criticize the illusions it is subject to.

=====The paralogisms of pure reason=====
One of the ways that pure reason erroneously tries to operate beyond the limits of possible experience is when it thinks that there is an immortal Soul in every person. Its proofs, however, are paralogisms, or the results of false reasoning.

======The soul is substance======
Every one of my thoughts and judgments is based on the presupposition &quot;I think&quot;. &quot;I&quot; is the subject and thinking is the predicate. Yet the ever-present &quot;logical subject&quot; of every thought should not be confused with a permanent, immortal, &quot;real substance&quot; (soul). The logical subject is a mere idea, not a real substance. Unlike Descartes, who believes that the soul may be known directly through reason, Kant asserts that no such thing is possible. Descartes declares &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot;, but Kant denies that any knowledge of &quot;I&quot; may be possible. &quot;I&quot; is only the background of the field of apperception and as such lacks the experience of direct intuition that would make self-knowledge possible. This implies that the self in itself could never be known. Like Hume, Kant rejects knowledge of the &quot;I&quot; as substance. For Kant, the &quot;I&quot; that is taken to be the soul is purely logical and involves no intuitions. The &quot;I&quot; is the result of the &quot;a priori&quot; consciousness continuum, not of direct intuition &quot;a posteriori&quot;. It is apperception as the principle of unity in the consciousness continuum that dictates the presence of &quot;I&quot; as a singular logical subject of all the representations of a single consciousness. Although &quot;I&quot; seems to refer to the same &quot;I&quot; all the time, it is not really a permanent feature but only the logical characteristic of a unified consciousness.

======The soul is simple======
The only use or advantage of asserting that the soul is simple is to differentiate it from matter and therefore prove that it is immortal, but the substratum of matter may also be simple. Since we know nothing of this substratum, both matter and soul may be fundamentally simple and therefore not different from each other. Then the soul may decay, as does matter. It makes no difference to say that the soul is simple and therefore immortal. Such a simple nature can never be known through experience. It has no objective validity. According to Descartes, the soul is indivisible. This paralogism mistakes the unity of apperception for the unity of an indivisible substance called the soul. It is a mistake that is the result of the first paralogism. It is impossible that thinking (&quot;Denken&quot;) could be composite for if the thought by a single consciousness were to be distributed piecemeal among different consciousnesses, the thought would be lost. According to Kant, the most important part of this proposition is that a multi-faceted presentation requires a single subject. This paralogism misinterprets the metaphysical oneness of the subject by interpreting the unity of apperception as being indivisible and the soul simple as a result. According to Kant, the simplicity of the soul as Descartes believed cannot be inferred from the &quot;I think&quot; as it is assumed to be there in the first place. Therefore, it is a tautology.

======The soul is a person======
In order to have coherent thoughts, I must have an &quot;I&quot; that is not changing and that thinks the changing thoughts. Yet we cannot prove that there is a permanent soul or an undying &quot;I&quot; that constitutes my person. I only know that I am one person during the time that I am conscious. As a subject who observes my own experiences, I attribute a certain identity to myself, but, to another observing subject, I am an object of his experience. He may attribute a different persisting identity to me. In the third paralogism, the &quot;I&quot; is a self-conscious person in a time continuum, which is the same as saying that personal identity is the result of an immaterial soul. The third paralogism mistakes the &quot;I&quot;, as unit of apperception being the same all the time, with the everlasting soul. According to Kant, the thought of &quot;I&quot; accompanies every personal thought and it is this that gives the illusion of a permanent I. However, the permanence of &quot;I&quot; in the unity of apperception is not the permanence of substance. For Kant, permanence is a schema, the conceptual means of bringing intuitions under a category. The paralogism confuses the permanence of an object seen from without with the permanence of the &quot;I&quot; in a unity of apperception seen from within. From the oneness of the apperceptive &quot;I&quot; nothing may be deduced. The &quot;I&quot; itself shall always remain unknown. The only ground for knowledge is the intuition, the basis of sense experience.

======The soul is separated from the experienced world======
The soul is not separate from the world. They exist for us only in relation to each other. Whatever we know about the external world is only a direct, immediate, internal experience. The world appears, in the way that it appears, as a mental phenomenon. We cannot know the world as a thing-in-itself, that is, other than as an appearance within us. To think about the world as being totally separate from the soul is to think that a mere phenomenal appearance has independent existence outside of us. If we try to know an object as being other than an appearance, it can only be known as a phenomenal appearance, never otherwise. We cannot know a separate, thinking, non-material soul or a separate, non-thinking, material world because we cannot know things, as to what they may be by themselves, beyond being objects of our senses. The fourth paralogism is passed over lightly or not treated at all by commentators. In the first edition of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, the fourth paralogism is addressed to refuting the thesis that there is no certainty of the existence of the external world. In the second edition of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, the task at hand becomes the Refutation of Idealism. Sometimes, the fourth paralogism is taken as one of the most awkward of Kant&#x27;s invented tetrads. Nevertheless, in the fourth paralogism, there is a great deal of philosophizing about the self that goes beyond the mere refutation of idealism. In both editions, Kant is trying to refute the same argument for the non-identity of mind and body. In the first edition, Kant refutes the Cartesian doctrine that there is direct knowledge of inner states only and that knowledge of the external world is exclusively by inference. Kant claims mysticism is one of the characteristics of Platonism, the main source of dogmatic idealism. Kant explains skeptical idealism by developing a syllogism called &quot;The Fourth Paralogism of the Ideality of Outer Relation:&quot;

# That whose existence can be inferred only as a cause of given perceptions has only a doubtful existence.
# And the existence of outer appearances cannot be immediately perceived but can be inferred only as the cause of given perceptions.
# Then, the existence of all objects of outer sense is doubtful.

Kant may have had in mind an argument by Descartes:

It is questionable that the fourth paralogism should appear in a chapter on the soul. What Kant implies about Descartes&#x27; argument in favor of the immaterial soul is that the argument rests upon a mistake on the nature of objective judgment not on any misconceptions about the soul. The attack is mislocated.

These Paralogisms cannot be proven for speculative reason and therefore can give no certain knowledge about the Soul. However, they can be retained as a guide to human behavior. In this way, they are necessary and sufficient for practical purposes. In order for humans to behave properly, they can suppose that the soul is an imperishable substance, it is indestructibly simple, it stays the same forever, and it is separate from the decaying material world. On the other hand, anti-rationalist critics of Kant&#x27;s ethics consider it too abstract, alienating, altruistic or detached from human concern to actually be able to guide human behavior. It is then that the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; offers the best defense, demonstrating that in human concern and behavior, the influence of rationality is preponderant.

=====The antinomy of pure reason=====
Kant presents the four antinomies of reason in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; as going beyond the rational intention of reaching a conclusion. For Kant, an antinomy is a pair of faultless arguments in favor of opposite conclusions. Historically, Leibniz and Samuel Clarke (Newton&#x27;s spokesman) had just recently engaged in a titanic debate of unprecedented repercussions. Kant&#x27;s formulation of the arguments was affected accordingly.

The Ideas of Rational Cosmology are dialectical. They result in four kinds of opposing assertions, each of which is logically valid. The antinomy, with its resolution, is as follows:

* &quot;Thesis&quot;: The world has, as to time and space, a beginning (limit).
* &quot;Antithesis&quot;: The world is, as to time and space, infinite.
: &quot;Both are false. The world is an object of experience. Neither statement is based on experience.&quot;

* &quot;Thesis&quot;: Everything in the world consists of elements that are simple.
* &quot;Antithesis&quot;: There is no simple thing, but everything is composite.
: &quot;Both are false. Things are objects of experience. Neither statement is based on experience.&quot;

* &quot;Thesis&quot;: There are in the world causes through freedom.
* &quot;Antithesis&quot;: There is no freedom, but all is nature.
: &quot;Both may be true. The thesis may be true of things-in-themselves (other than as they appear). The antithesis may be true of things as they appear.&quot;

* &quot;Thesis&quot;: In the series of the world-causes there is some necessary being.
* &quot;Antithesis&quot;: There is nothing necessary in the world, but in this series all is contingent.
: &quot;Both may be true. The thesis may be true of things-in-themselves (other than as they appear). The antithesis may be true of things as they appear.&quot;

According to Kant, rationalism came to fruition by defending the thesis of each antinomy while empiricism evolved into new developments by working to better the arguments in favor of each antithesis.

=====The ideal of pure reason=====
Pure reason mistakenly goes beyond its relation to possible experience when it concludes that there is a Being who is the most real thing (&quot;ens realissimum&quot;) conceivable. This &quot;ens realissimum&quot; is the philosophical origin of the idea of God. This personified object is postulated by Reason as the subject of all predicates, the sum total of all reality. Kant called this Supreme Being, or God, the Ideal of Pure Reason because it exists as the highest and most complete condition of the possibility of all objects, their original cause and their continual support.

======Refutation of the ontological proof of God&#x27;s existence of Anselm of Canterbury======
The ontological proof can be traced back to Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109). Anselm presented the proof in chapter II of a short treatise titled &quot;Discourse on the existence of God.&quot; It was not Kant but the monk Gaunilo and later the Scholastic Thomas Aquinas who first challenged the success of the proof. Aquinas went on to provide his own proofs for the existence of God in what are known as the Five Ways.

The ontological proof considers the concept of the most real Being (&quot;ens realissimum&quot;) and concludes that it is necessary.
The ontological argument states that God exists because he is perfect. If he did not exist, he would be less than perfect. Existence is assumed to be a predicate or attribute of the subject, God, but Kant asserted that existence is not a predicate. Existence or Being is merely the infinitive of the copula or linking, connecting verb &quot;is&quot; in a declarative sentence. It connects the subject to a predicate. &quot;Existence is evidently not a real predicate ... The small word &quot;is&quot;, is not an additional predicate, but only serves to put the predicate &quot;in relation&quot; to the subject.&quot; (A599) Also, we cannot accept a mere concept or mental idea as being a real, external thing or object. The Ontological Argument starts with a mere mental concept of a perfect God and tries to end with a real, existing God.

The argument is essentially deductive in nature. Given a certain fact, it proceeds to infer another from it. The method pursued, then, is that of deducing the fact of God&#x27;s being from the a priori idea of him. If man finds that the idea of God is necessarily involved in his self-consciousness, it is legitimate for him to proceed from this notion to the actual existence of the divine being. In other words, the idea of God necessarily includes existence. It may include it in several ways. One may argue, for instance, according to the method of Descartes, and say that the conception of God could have originated only with the divine being himself, therefore the idea possessed by us is based on the prior existence of God himself. Or we may allege that we have the idea that God is the most necessary of all beings—that is to say, he belongs to the class of realities; consequently it cannot but be a fact that he exists. This is held to be proof &quot;per saltum&quot;. A leap takes place from the premise to the conclusion, and all intermediate steps are omitted.

The implication is that premise and conclusion stand over against one another without any obvious, much less necessary, connection. A jump is made from thought to reality. Kant here objects that being or existence is not a mere attribute that may be added onto a subject, thereby increasing its qualitative content. The predicate, being, adds something to the subject that no mere quality can give. It informs us that the idea is not a mere conception, but is also an actually existing reality. Being, as Kant thinks, actually increases the concept itself in such a way as to transform it. You may attach as many attributes as you please to a concept; you do not thereby lift it out of the subjective sphere and render it actual. So you may pile attribute upon attribute on the conception of God, but at the end of the day you are not necessarily one step nearer his actual existence. So that when we say &quot;God exists&quot;, we do not simply attach a new attribute to our conception; we do far more than this implies. We pass our bare concept from the sphere of inner subjectivity to that of actuality. This is the great vice of the Ontological argument. The idea of ten dollars is different from the fact only in reality. In the same way the conception of God is different from the fact of his existence only in reality. When, accordingly, the Ontological proof declares that the latter is involved in the former, it puts forward nothing more than a mere statement. No proof is forthcoming precisely where proof is most required. We are not in a position to say that the idea of God includes existence, because it is of the very nature of ideas not to include existence.

Kant explains that, being, not being a predicate, could not characterize a thing. Logically, it is the copula of a judgment. In the proposition, &quot;God is almighty&quot;, the copula &quot;is&quot; does not add a new predicate; it only unites a predicate to a subject. To take God with all its predicates and say that &quot;God is&quot; is equivalent to &quot;God exists&quot; or that &quot;There is a God&quot; is to jump to a conclusion as no new predicate is being attached to God. The content of both subject and predicate is one and the same. According to Kant then, existence is not really a predicate. Therefore, there is really no connection between the idea of God and God&#x27;s appearance or disappearance. No statement about God whatsoever may establish God&#x27;s existence. Kant makes a distinction between &quot;in intellectus&quot; (in mind) and &quot;in re&quot; (in reality or in fact) so that questions of being are &quot;a priori&quot; and questions of existence are resolved &quot;a posteriori&quot;.

======Refutation of the cosmological (&quot;prime mover&quot;) proof of God&#x27;s existence======
The cosmological proof considers the concept of an absolutely necessary Being and concludes that it has the most reality. In this way, the cosmological proof is merely the converse of the ontological proof. Yet the cosmological proof purports to start from sense experience. It says, &quot;If anything exists in the cosmos, then there must be an absolutely necessary Being. &quot; It then claims, on Kant&#x27;s interpretation, that there is only one concept of an absolutely necessary object. That is the concept of a Supreme Being who has maximum reality. Only such a supremely real being would be necessary and independently existent, but, according to Kant, this is the Ontological Proof again, which was asserted &quot;a priori&quot; without sense experience.

Summarizing the cosmological argument further, it may be stated as follows: &quot;Contingent things exist—at least I exist; and as they are not self-caused, nor capable of explanation as an infinite series, it is requisite to infer that a necessary being, on whom they depend, exists.&quot; Seeing that this being exists, he belongs to the realm of reality. Seeing that all things issue from him, he is the most necessary of beings, for only a being who is self-dependent, who possesses all the conditions of reality within himself, could be the origin of contingent things. And such a being is God.

Kant argues that this proof is invalid for three chief reasons. First, it makes use of a category, namely, Cause. And, as has been already pointed out, it is not possible to apply this, or any other, category except to the matter given by sense under the general conditions of space and time. If, then, we employ it in relation to Deity, we try to force its application in a sphere where it is useless, and incapable of affording any information. Once more, we are in the now familiar difficulty of the paralogism of Rational Psychology or of the Antinomies. The category has meaning only when applied to phenomena. Yet God is a noumenon. Second, it mistakes an idea of absolute necessity—an idea that is nothing more than an ideal—for a synthesis of elements in the phenomenal world or world of experience. This necessity is not an object of knowledge, derived from sensation and set in shape by the operation of categories. It cannot be regarded as more than an inference. Yet the cosmological argument treats it as if it were an object of knowledge exactly on the same level as perception of any thing or object in the course of experience. Thirdly, according to Kant, it presupposes the Ontological argument, already proved false. It does this, because it proceeds from the conception of the necessity of a certain being to the fact of his existence. Yet it is possible to take this course only if idea and fact are convertible with one another, and it has just been proved that they are not so convertible.

======Physico-theological (&quot;watch maker&quot;) proof of God&#x27;s existence======
The physico-theological proof of God&#x27;s existence is supposed to be based on &quot;a posteriori&quot; sensed experience of nature and not on mere &quot; a priori&quot; abstract concepts. It observes that the objects in the world have been intentionally arranged with great wisdom. The fitness of this arrangement could never have occurred randomly, without purpose. The world must have been caused by an intelligent power. The of the relation between all of the parts of the world leads us to infer that there is only one cause of everything. That one cause is a perfect, mighty, wise, and self-sufficient Being. This physico-theology does not, however, prove with certainty the existence of God. For this, we need something absolutely necessary that consequently has all-embracing reality, but this is the Cosmological Proof, which concludes that an all-encompassing real Being has absolutely necessary existence. All three proofs can be reduced to the Ontological Proof, which tried to make an objective reality out of a subjective concept.

In abandoning any attempt to prove the existence of God, Kant declares the three proofs of rational theology known as the ontological, the cosmological and the physico-theological as quite untenable. However, it is important to realize that while Kant intended to refute various purported proofs of the &quot;existence&quot; of God, he also intended to demonstrate the impossibility of proving the &quot;non-existence&quot; of God. Far from advocating for a rejection of religious belief, Kant rather hoped to demonstrate the impossibility of attaining the sort of substantive metaphysical knowledge (either proof or disproof) about God, free will, or the soul that many previous philosophers had pursued.

==II. Transcendental Doctrine of Method==
The second book in the &quot;Critique&quot;, and by far the shorter of the two, attempts to lay out the formal conditions of the complete system of pure reason.

In the Transcendental Dialectic, Kant showed how pure reason is improperly used when it is not related to experience. In the Method of Transcendentalism, he explained the proper use of pure reason.

===The discipline of pure reason===
In section I, the discipline of pure reason in the sphere of dogmatism, of chapter I, the discipline of pure reason, of Part II, transcendental discipline of method, of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, Kant enters into the most extensive discussion of the relationship between mathematical theory and philosophy.

Discipline is the restraint, through caution and self-examination, that prevents philosophical pure reason from applying itself beyond the limits of possible sensual experience. Philosophy cannot possess dogmatic certainty. Philosophy, unlike mathematics, cannot have definitions, axioms or demonstrations. All philosophical concepts must be ultimately based on &quot;a posteriori&quot;, experienced intuition. This is different from algebra and geometry, which use concepts that are derived from &quot;a priori&quot; intuitions, such as symbolic equations and spatial figures. Kant&#x27;s basic intention in this section of the text is to describe why reason should not go beyond its already well-established limits. In section I, the discipline of pure reason in the sphere of dogmatism, Kant clearly explains why philosophy cannot do what mathematics can do in spite of their similarities. Kant also explains that when reason goes beyond its own limits, it becomes dogmatic. For Kant, the limits of reason lie in the field of experience as, after all, all knowledge depends on experience. According to Kant, a dogmatic statement would be a statement that reason accepts as true even though it goes beyond the bounds of experience.

Restraint should be exercised in the polemical use of pure reason. Kant defined this polemical use as the defense against dogmatic negations. For example, if it is dogmatically affirmed that God exists or that the soul is immortal, a dogmatic negation could be made that God does not exist or that the soul is not immortal. Such dogmatic assertions cannot be proved. The statements are not based on possible experience. In section II, the discipline of pure reason in polemics, Kant argues strongly against the polemical use of pure reason. The dogmatic use of reason would be the acceptance as true of a statement that goes beyond the bounds of reason while the polemic use of reason would be the defense of such statement against any attack that could be raised against it. For Kant, then, there cannot possibly be any polemic use of pure reason. Kant argues against the polemic use of pure reason and considers it improper on the grounds that opponents cannot engage in a rational dispute based on a question that goes beyond the bounds of experience.

Kant claimed that adversaries should be freely allowed to speak reason. In return, they should be opposed through reason. Dialectical strife leads to an increase of reason&#x27;s knowledge. Yet there should be no dogmatic polemical use of reason. The critique of pure reason is the tribunal for all of reason&#x27;s disputes. It determines the rights of reason in general. We should be able to openly express our thoughts and doubts. This leads to improved insight. We should eliminate polemic in the form of opposed dogmatic assertions that cannot be related to possible experience.

According to Kant, the censorship of reason is the examination and possible rebuke of reason. Such censorship leads to doubt and skepticism. After dogmatism produces opposing assertions, skepticism usually occurs. The doubts of skepticism awaken reason from its dogmatism and bring about an examination of reason&#x27;s rights and limits. It is necessary to take the next step after dogmatism and skepticism. This is the step to criticism. By criticism, the limits of our knowledge are proved from principles, not from mere personal experience.

If criticism of reason teaches us that we cannot know anything unrelated to experience, can we have hypotheses, guesses, or opinions about such matters? We can only imagine a thing that would be a possible object of experience. The hypotheses of God or a soul cannot be dogmatically affirmed or denied, but we have a practical interest in their existence. It is therefore up to an opponent to prove that they do not exist. Such hypotheses can be used to expose the pretensions of dogmatism. Kant explicitly praises Hume on his critique of religion for being beyond the field of natural science. However, Kant goes so far and not further in praising Hume basically because of Hume&#x27;s skepticism. If only Hume would be critical rather than skeptical, Kant would be all-praises. In concluding that there is no polemical use of pure reason, Kant also concludes there is no skeptical use of pure reason. In section II, the discipline of pure reason in polemics, in a special section, skepticism not a permanent state for human reason, Kant mentions Hume but denies the possibility that skepticism could possibly be the final end of reason or could possibly serve its best interests.

Proofs of transcendental propositions about pure reason (God, soul, free will, causality, simplicity) must first prove whether the concept is valid. Reason should be moderated and not asked to perform beyond its power. The three rules of the proofs of pure reason are: (1) consider the legitimacy of your principles, (2) each proposition can have only one proof because it is based on one concept and its general object, and (3) only direct proofs can be used, never indirect proofs (e.g., a proposition is true because its opposite is false). By attempting to directly prove transcendental assertions, it will become clear that pure reason can gain no speculative knowledge and must restrict itself to practical, moral principles. The dogmatic use of reason is called into question by the skeptical use of reason but skepticism does not present a permanent state for human reason. Kant proposes instead a critique of pure reason by means of which the limitations of reason are clearly established and the field of knowledge is circumscribed by experience. According to the rationalists and skeptics, there are analytic judgments &quot;a priori&quot; and synthetic judgments &quot;a posteriori&quot;. Analytic judgments &quot;a posteriori&quot; do not really exist. Added to all these rational judgments is Kant&#x27;s great discovery of the synthetic judgment &quot;a priori&quot;.

===The canon of pure reason===
The canon of pure reason is a discipline for the limitation of pure reason. The analytic part of logic in general is a canon for the understanding and reason in general. However, the Transcendental Analytic is a canon of the pure understanding for only the pure understanding is able to judge synthetically &quot;a priori&quot;.

The speculative propositions of God, immortal soul, and free will have no cognitive use but are valuable to our moral interest. In pure philosophy, reason is morally (practically) concerned with what ought to be done if the will is free, if there is a God, and if there is a future world. Yet, in its actual practical employment and use, reason is only concerned with the existence of God and a future life. Basically, the canon of pure reason deals with two questions: Is there a God? Is there a future life? These questions are translated by the canon of pure reason into two criteria: What ought I to do? and What may I hope for? yielding the postulates of God&#x27;s own existence and a future life, or life in the future.

The greatest advantage of the philosophy of pure reason is negative, the prevention of error. Yet moral reason can provide positive knowledge. There cannot be a canon, or system of &quot;a priori&quot; principles, for the correct use of speculative reason. However, there can be a canon for the practical (moral) use of reason.

Reason has three main questions and answers:

# What can I know? We cannot know, through reason, anything that cannot be a possible sense experience; (&quot;that all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt&quot;)
# What should I do? Do that which will make you deserve happiness;
# What may I hope? We can hope to be happy as far as we have made ourselves deserving of it through our conduct.

Reason tells us that there is a God, the supreme good, who arranges a future life in a moral world. If not, moral laws would be idle fantasies. Our happiness in that intelligible world will exactly depend on how we have made ourselves worthy of being happy. The union of speculative and practical reason occurs when we see God&#x27;s reason and purpose in nature&#x27;s unity of design or general system of ends. The speculative extension of reason is severely limited in the transcendental dialectics of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, which Kant would later fully explore in the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;.

In the transcendental use of reason, there can be neither opinion nor knowledge. Reason results in a strong belief in the unity of design and purpose in nature. This unity requires a wise God who provides a future life for the human soul. Such a strong belief rests on moral certainty, not logical certainty. Even if a person has no moral beliefs, the fear of God and a future life acts as a deterrent to evil acts, because no one can prove the non-existence of God and an afterlife. Does all of this philosophy merely lead to two articles of faith, namely, God and the immortal soul? With regard to these essential interests of human nature, the highest philosophy can achieve no more than the guidance, which belongs to the pure understanding. Some would even go so far as to interpret the Transcendental Analytic of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; as a return to the Cartesian epistemological tradition and a search for truth through certainty.

===The architectonic of pure reason===
All knowledge from pure reason is architectonic in that it is a systematic unity. The entire system of metaphysic consists of: (1.) Ontology—objects in general; (2.) Rational Physiology—given objects; (3.) Rational cosmology—the whole world; (4.) Rational Theology—God. Metaphysic supports religion and curbs the extravagant use of reason beyond possible experience. The components of metaphysic are criticism, metaphysic of nature, and metaphysic of morals. These constitute philosophy in the genuine sense of the word. It uses science to gain wisdom. Metaphysic investigates reason, which is the foundation of science. Its censorship of reason promotes order and harmony in science and maintains metaphysic&#x27;s main purpose, which is general happiness. In chapter III, the architectonic of pure reason, Kant defines metaphysics as the critique of pure reason in relation to pure &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge. Morals, analytics and dialectics for Kant constitute metaphysics, which is philosophy and the highest achievement of human reason.

===The history of pure reason===
Kant writes that metaphysics began with the study of the belief in God and the nature of a future world, beyond this immediate world as we know it, in our common sense. It was concluded early that good conduct would result in happiness in another world as arranged by God. The object of rational knowledge was investigated by sensualists (Epicurus), and intellectualists (Plato). Sensualists claimed that only the objects of the senses are real. Intellectualists asserted that true objects are known only by the understanding mind. Aristotle and Locke thought that the pure concepts of reason are derived only from experience. Plato and Leibniz contended that they come from reason, not sense experience, which is illusory. Epicurus never speculated beyond the limits of experience. Locke, however, said that the existence of God and the immortality of the soul could be proven. Those who follow the naturalistic method of studying the problems of pure reason use their common, sound, or healthy reason, not scientific speculation. Others, who use the scientific method, are either dogmatists (Wolff) or skeptics (Hume). In Kant&#x27;s view, all of the above methods are faulty. The method of criticism remains as the path toward the completely satisfying answers to the metaphysical questions about God and the future life in another world.

===Intuition and concept===
Kant distinguishes between two different fundamental &quot;types of representation&quot;: intuitions and concepts:

# &quot;Concepts&quot; are &quot;mediate representations&quot; (see A68/B93). Mediate representations represent things by representing general characteristics of things. For example, consider a particular chair. The concepts &quot;brown,&quot; &quot;wooden,&quot; &quot;chair,&quot; and so forth are, according to Kant, mediate representations of the chair. They can represent the chair by representing general characteristics of the chair: being brown, being wooden, being a chair, and so forth.
# &quot;Intuitions&quot; are &quot;immediate representations&quot; (see B41), that is, representations that represent things directly. One&#x27;s perception of the chair is, according to Kant, an immediate representation. The perception represents the chair directly, and not by means of any general characteristics.
Kant divides intuitions in the following ways:
# Kant distinguishes intuitions into &quot;pure&quot; intuitions and &quot;empirical&quot; intuitions. Empirical intuitions are intuitions that contain sensation. Pure intuitions are intuitions that do not contain any sensation (A50/B74). An example of an empirical intuition would be one&#x27;s perception of a chair or another physical object. All such intuitions are immediate representations that have sensation as part of the content of the representation. The pure intuitions are, according to Kant, those of space and time, which are our mind&#x27;s subjective condition of coordinating sensibilia. Our representations of space and time are not objective and real, but immediate representations that do not include sensation within those representations. Thus both are pure intuitions.
# Kant also divides intuitions into two groups in another way. Some intuitions require the &quot;presence&quot; of their object, i.e. of the thing represented by the intuition. Other intuitions do not. (The best source for these distinctions is Kant&#x27;s Lectures on Metaphysics.) We might think of these in non-Kantian terms as first, perceptions, and second, imaginations (see B151). An example of the former: one&#x27;s perception of a chair. An example of the latter: one&#x27;s memory (&quot;Gedachtnis&quot;/&quot;Erinnerung&quot;) of a chair that has subsequently been destroyed. Throughout the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant seems to restrict his discussion to intuitions of the former type: intuitions that require the presence of their object.

Kant also distinguished between &quot;a priori&quot; (pure) and &quot;a posteriori&quot; (empirical) concepts.

==Tables of principles and categories of understanding in the critique==
Kant borrowed the term &quot;categories&quot; from Aristotle, but with the concession that Aristotle&#x27;s own categorizations were faulty. Aristotle&#x27;s imperfection is apparent from his inclusion of &quot;some modes of pure sensibility (&quot;quando, ubi, situs, &quot;also &quot;prius, simul&quot;), also an empirical concept (&quot;motus&quot;), none of which can belong to this genealogical register of the understanding.&quot;

Kant&#x27;s divisions, however, are guided by his search in the mind for what makes synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; judgments possible.

==Reception==
===Early responses: 1781–1793===
The &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; was the first of Kant&#x27;s works to become famous. According to the philosopher Frederick C. Beiser, it helped to discredit rationalist metaphysics of the kind associated with Leibniz and Wolff which had appeared to provide &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge of the existence of God, although Beiser notes that this school of thought was already in decline by the time the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; was published. In his view, Kant&#x27;s philosophy became successful in the early 1790s partly because Kant&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;practical faith&quot; seemed to provide a justification for moral, religious, and political beliefs without an &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge of God. However, the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; received little attention when it was first published. Kant did not expect reviews from anyone qualified to appraise the work, and initially heard only complaints about its obscurity. The theologian and philosopher Johann Friedrich Schultz wrote that the public saw the work as &quot;a sealed book&quot; consisting in nothing but &quot;hieroglyphics&quot;. The first review appeared in the &quot;Zugaben zu den Göttinger gelehrte Anzeigen&quot; in 1782. The review, which denied that there is any distinction between Kant&#x27;s idealism and that of Berkeley, was anonymous and became notorious. Kant reformulated his views because of it, redefining his transcendental idealism in the &quot;Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics&quot; (1783) and the second edition of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. The review was denounced by Kant, but defended by Kant&#x27;s empiricist critics, and the resulting controversy drew attention to the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;.

Kant believed that the anonymous review was biased and deliberately misunderstood his views. He discussed it in an appendix of the &quot;Prolegomena&quot;, accusing its author of failing to understand or even address the main issue addressed in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, the possibility of synthetic a priori judgments, and insisting on the distinction between transcendental idealism and the idealism of Berkeley. In a letter to Kant, the philosopher Christian Garve admitted to having written the review, which he disowned due to editorial changes outside his control. Though Garve did not inform Kant of this, the changes were made by J. G. Feder. Following the controversy over Garve&#x27;s review, there were no more reviews of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; in 1782 except for a brief notice. The work received greater attention only in 1784, when Shultz&#x27;s commentary was published and a review by the philosopher and historian of philosophy Dietrich Tiedemann was published in the &quot;Hessische Beyträge zur Gelehrsamkeit und Kunst&quot;. Tiedemann attacked the possibility of the synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; and defended the possibility of metaphysics. He denied the synthetic status of mathematical judgments, maintaining that they can be shown to be analytic if the subject term is analyzed in full detail, and criticized Kant&#x27;s theory of the &quot;a priori&quot; nature of space, asking how it was possible to distinguish one place from another when the parts of absolute space are identical in themselves. Kant issued a hostile reaction. He maintained that Tiedemann did not understand the problems facing the critical philosophy.

Christian Gottlieb Selle, an empiricist critic of Kant influenced by Locke to whom Kant had sent one of the complimentary copies of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, was disappointed by the work, considering it a reversion to rationalism and scholasticism, and began a polemical campaign against Kant, arguing against the possibility of all &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge. His writings received widespread attention and created controversy. Though Kant was unable to write a reply to Selle, he did engage in a public dispute with Feder, after learning of Feder&#x27;s role in the review published in &quot;Zugaben zu den Göttinger Gelehrten Anzeigen&quot;. In 1788, Feder published &quot;Ueber Raum und Causalität: Zur Prüfung der kantischen Philosophie&quot;, a polemic against the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; in which he argued that Kant employed a &quot;dogmatic method&quot; and was still employing the methodology of rationalist metaphysics, and that Kant&#x27;s transcendental philosophy transcends the limits of possible experience. Feder believed that Kant&#x27;s fundamental error was his contempt for &quot;empirical philosophy&quot;, which explains the faculty of knowledge according to the laws of nature. With Christian Meiners, he edited a journal, the &quot;Philosophische Bibliothek&quot;, opposed to Kantianism.

Feder&#x27;s campaign against Kant was unsuccessful and the &quot;Philosophische Bibliothek&quot; ceased publication after only a few issues. Other critics of Kant continued to argue against the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, with Gottlob August Tittel, who was influenced by Locke, publishing several polemics against Kant, who, although worried by some of Tittel&#x27;s criticisms, addressed him only in a footnote in the preface to the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;. Tittel was one of the first to make criticisms of Kant, such as those concerning Kant&#x27;s table of categories, the categorical imperative, and the problem of applying the categories to experience, that have continued to be influential. The philosopher Adam Weishaupt, founder and leader of the secret society the Illuminati, and an ally of Feder, also published several polemics against Kant, which attracted controversy and generated excitement. Weishaupt charged that Kant&#x27;s philosophy leads to complete subjectivism and the denial of all reality independent of passing states of consciousness, a view he considered self-refuting. Herman Andreas Pistorius was another empiricist critic of Kant. Kant took Pistorius more seriously than his other critics and believed that he had made some of the most important objections to the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. Beiser writes that many sections of the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; are &quot;disguised polemics against Pistorius&quot;. Pistorius argued that, if Kant were consistent, his form of idealism would not be an improvement over that of Berkeley, and that Kant&#x27;s philosophy contains internal contradictions.

Though the followers of Wolff, such as J. G. E. Maass, J. F. Flatt, and J. A. Ulrich, initially ignored the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, they began to publish polemics against Kant in 1788. The theologian Johann Augustus Eberhard began to publish the &quot;Philosophisches Magazin&quot;, which was dedicated to defending Wolff&#x27;s philosophy. The Wolffian critics argued that Kant&#x27;s philosophy inevitably ends in skepticism and the impossibility of knowledge, defending the possibility of rational knowledge of the supersensible world as the only way of avoiding solipsism. They maintained that the criterion Kant proposed to distinguish between analytic and synthetic judgments had been known to Leibniz and was useless, since it was too vague to determine which judgments are analytic or synthetic in specific cases. These arguments led to a controversy between the Wolffians and Kant&#x27;s followers over the originality and adequacy of Kant&#x27;s criterion.

===Later responses===
The &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; has exerted an enduring influence on Western philosophy. The constructive aspect of the work, Kant&#x27;s attempt to ground the conditions for the possibility of objects in the conditions of experience, helped bring about the development of German idealism. The work also influenced Young Hegelians such as Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach and Karl Marx, and also, Friedrich Nietzsche, whose philosophy has been seen as a form of &quot;radical Kantianism&quot; by Howard Caygill. Other interpretations of the &quot;Critique&quot; by philosophers and historians of philosophy have stressed different aspects of the work. The late 19th-century neo-Kantians Hermann Cohen and Heinrich Rickert focused on its philosophical justification of science, Martin Heidegger and Heinz Heimsoeth on aspects of ontology, and Peter Strawson on the limits of reason within the boundaries of sensory experience. Hannah Arendt and Jean-François Lyotard dealt with its work of orientation of a limited understanding in the field of world history. According to Physiologist Homer W. Smith,

=== Legacy ===
Many titles have been used by different authors in reference or as a tribute to Kant&#x27;s main &quot;Critique&quot;, or his other, less famous books using the same basic concept, &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; and &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot;. Since the 18th century, books using &quot;critique&quot; in their title became common. Also, when &quot;reason&quot; is added after an adjective which qualifies this reason, this is usually a reference to Kant&#x27;s most famous book. A few examples:
* &quot;Critique of the Kantian Philosophy&quot; (1818), as an appendix of &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; by Arthur Schopenhauer;
* &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; (1960), by Jean-Paul Sartre;
* &quot;Critique of Cynical Reason&quot; (1983), by Peter Sloterdijk;
* &quot;Critique of Impure Reason&quot; (2021), by Steven James Bartlett

<doc id="347547" wikidata="Q131261" url="?curid=347547" title="Oliver Kahn">
<text>Oliver Rolf Kahn (; born 15 June 1969) is a German football executive and former professional player who played as a goalkeeper. He started his career in the Karlsruher SC Junior team in 1975. Twelve years later, Kahn made his debut match in the professional squad. In 1994, he was transferred to Bayern Munich for the fee of DM 4.6 million, where he played until the end of his career in 2008. His commanding presence in goal and aggressive style earned him nicknames such as &quot;Der Titan&quot; (, &quot;The Titan&quot;) from the press and &quot;Vol-kahn-o&quot; (&quot;volcano&quot;) from fans.
Kahn is one of the most successful German players in recent history, having won eight Bundesliga titles, six DFB-Pokals, the UEFA Cup in 1996, the UEFA Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup, both achieved in 2001. Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, his individual contributions have earned him a record four consecutive UEFA Best European Goalkeeper awards, as well as three IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper awards, and two German Footballer of the Year trophies. At the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Kahn became the only goalkeeper in the tournament&#x27;s history to win the Golden Ball. Kahn placed fifth in both the IFFHS Best Goalkeeper of the 21st Century and Best Goalkeeper of the Past 25 Years elections.

From 1994 to 2006, Kahn was in the Germany national team, in which he played as a starter after the retirement of Andreas Köpke, he was an unused member of the squad that won the 1996 UEFA European Championship. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, although Germany were not among the tournament favourites, Kahn&#x27;s prowess, despite being injured, in goal was key to reaching the final, where Germany lost 0–2 to Brazil. Kahn made a mistake on Brazil&#x27;s first goal; nonetheless, he received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament.

On 1 July 2021, he became the CEO of Bayern Munich till 27 May 2023.

== Club career ==
=== Karlsruher SC ===
At the age of six, Kahn joined Karlsruher SC, where his father Rolf had played from 1962 to 1965. He started as a field player before becoming goalkeeper. Kahn was included in the team&#x27;s professional squad in the 1987–88 season of the first Bundesliga division, at first being the reserve goalkeeper behind Alexander Famulla. On 27 November 1987, Kahn made his league debut in a 4–0 away defeat to 1. FC Köln. However, not until 1990 did manager Winfried Schäfer decide to start him over Famulla. In the following years, Kahn established himself as the team&#x27;s starting goalkeeper. He was considered a key player and a motivator in the Karlsruher SC squad which reached the semi-finals in the 1993–94 UEFA Cup. During the round of sixteen the team accomplished a 7–0 rout of Valencia at its home field after losing the first match 1–3 at the Mestalla Stadium. The game was nicknamed the &quot;Miracle at Wildparkstadion&quot; by the German media. The team was defeated by SV Austria Salzburg in the semi-final.

=== Bayern Munich ===

Kahn&#x27;s performance for Karlsruher SC prompted Bayern Munich to express interest in acquiring him. The team signed him as a replacement for Raimond Aumann at the beginning of the 1994–95 season, for the at that time record fee of DM4.6 million (€2.385 million) for his position, and was established as Bayern&#x27;s starting goalkeeper. Although suffering a rupture of his cruciate ligament, which kept him off the field for almost six months, Kahn made his debut match for the Germany national team two months after his return. Bayern defeated Bordeaux 3–1 in the 1996 UEFA Cup Final. In the 1996–97 Bundesliga season, Kahn achieved his first German championship with Bayern Munich, the German League Cup, and was named German Goalkeeper of the Year for the second time in his career (the first in 1994).

In 1999, Bayern Munich reached the 1999 Champions League Final, facing Manchester United at Camp Nou. Although Bayern Munich player Mario Basler scored an early goal in the sixth minute of the game, two goals by Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær in injury time led to United&#x27;s victory. The same year, he was named World Goalkeeper of the Year by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics.

Kahn was sent off in an incident against Hansa Rostock on 3 March 2001. With his Bayern Munich team losing 2–3 in the final minutes, he sneaked into the area during a corner kick, jumped up, and punched the ball into the opponent&#x27;s net. He immediately received a red card, which dismissed him from the game. Later, he joked, &quot;I thought the goalkeeper was allowed to use his hands in the box.&quot; Kahn played an important role in the team that won the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League. In the final against Valencia, Kahn won man of the match after saving three penalties in the penalty shoot-out. He also received the UEFA Fair Play Award for this match, after he walked up to a disappointed Santiago Cañizares, the opposition goalkeeper, after the penalty shoot-out and attempted to comfort him. The same year, Bayern Munich won the Intercontinental Cup at Tokyo&#x27;s National Stadium against the Argentine team Boca Juniors.

By Kahn&#x27;s account, injuries, personal problems and a lack of motivation were responsible for his game going into a rapid decline during the 2002–03 season. This culminated with Kahn allowing a seemingly soft shot by Roberto Carlos into the net against Real Madrid in the first knockout-round of the 2003–04 Champions League season, contributing to the elimination of his team from the competition. Bayern Munich won the next Bundesliga season with Kahn.
Prior to a 2006 match against Arminia Bielefeld in Munich, Michael Rensing peppered Kahn with practice shots. One shot hit Kahn squarely in the eye, causing enough swelling and discoloration to keep him from playing. With Rensing in goal, Bayern Munich won the match 2–0.

Kahn announced his intention to honour his contract and play through the 2007–08 season. As of 2023, he has the second-most all-time clean sheets in the history of the Bundesliga with 204, only behind Manuel Neuer. On 2 September 2007, aged 38, he played his 535th Bundesliga match, becoming the league&#x27;s all-time leader among goalkeepers in matches played. Kahn made his final European appearance for Bayern in a 4–0 defeat to Zenit Saint Petersburg in the UEFA Cup semi-final on 1 May 2008. His last Bundesliga game was the 4–1 victory against Hertha Berlin on 17 May. It was his 557th appearance in the German top-flight.
After a 20-year career, of which he played 14 with Bayern, he had his professional farewell in a testimonial match versus the select Germany XI on 2 September 2008, which ended 1–1. His last appearance for Bayern Munich was on 27 May 2008 at the Salt Lake Stadium (Yuba Bharati Krirangan), Kolkata, in a friendly against Mohun Bagan of India during Bayern&#x27;s Asian tour of 2008. Around 120,000 people turned up for the match. The match ended 0–3 in favour of Bayern and Michael Rensing substituted him in the 55th minute.

== International career ==
Kahn was initially called for the Germany national team as a late back-up for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, as third keeper behind veteran starter Bodo Illgner and Andreas Köpke; however he made his first international appearance on 23 June 1995 in a 2–1 victory against Switzerland, two months after recovering from his cruciate ligament injury. Along with Oliver Reck, Kahn was a reserve keeper of the squad, which won the 1996 UEFA European Football Championship in England, as the back-up to the now starting keeper Köpke. 

Kahn spent the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France on the bench, and it was not until Köpke announced his retirement at the end of the tournament that Kahn became the starting goalkeeper. Two years after the 2000 UEFA European Football Championship, in which defending champions Germany made an embarrassing exit in the group stage, Kahn received the squad&#x27;s captaincy, succeeding the striker Oliver Bierhoff.

Kahn experienced one of his worst performances in his international career against England in Munich in 2001. Germany were favoured to win as they had beaten England 1–0 in 2000 at the Wembley Stadium. However, they were routed 5–1, including a hat-trick by Michael Owen. Despite the defeat, Germany qualified for the World Cup after winning a playoff against Ukraine, and Kahn remained as Germany&#x27;s number one for the upcoming Cup. Kahn was named the best goalkeeper in the world by IFFHS for the second time in his career.

Despite Germany&#x27;s comparatively low expectations when for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team advanced to the final; Kahn conceded only three goals in the course of the competition, two of which were in the Final. Playing the final match with torn ligaments in his right ring finger, Kahn conceded the first goal by fumbling a rebounded shot from Rivaldo to the feet of striker Ronaldo in the 67th minute. Once the game was over with Brazil as the new champion, he stood alone and disappointed in his goal; nevertheless he refused to blame his injury for his mistake. The FIFA Technical Study Group awarded him with the Lev Yashin Award for the best goalkeeper of the tournament, while also edging out tournament top scorer Ronaldo to receive the Golden Ball for the best individual performance. Kahn is the only goalkeeper in World Cup history to win the Golden Ball, and also became the first German goalkeeper to keep five clean sheets in a World Cup tournament.

Kahn maintained his number one spot for the 2004 UEFA European Football Championship, but Germany were once again eliminated in the group stage. Oliver Kahn gave up his captaincy to Michael Ballack after the tournament.

Germany&#x27;s new manager Jürgen Klinsmann, who replaced Rudi Völler, adopted the strategy of rotating the number one spot between Kahn and his longtime competitor, Jens Lehmann of Arsenal, to stimulate competition between the two. On 7 April 2006, after two years of dispute for the position Klinsmann announced Lehmann was his first-choice goalkeeper for the 2006 World Cup. Kahn decided to stay on as a backup for the competition; despite their acrimonious pre-tournament battle for Germany&#x27;s starting role, Kahn openly accepted Klinsmann&#x27;s decision. Kahn and Lehmann embraced and shook hands as the former offered words of encouragement before the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against Argentina. In the postgame conference, Kahn publicly praised Lehmann for his two decisive penalty saves.

After Germany was eliminated in the semi-finals by eventual champions Italy, Kahn was given the start for the third place play-off held on 8 July 2006, which Germany won 3–1 against Portugal. In what was his last international appearance for Germany, he also received the captaincy of the team in the absence of the injured Michael Ballack. Although overshadowed by Bastian Schweinsteiger&#x27;s game-winning performance in the match, Kahn played to a high standard, pulling off several saves. Kahn deflected a shot by Portuguese forward Pauleta after he beat the German defence, and later saved Deco&#x27;s shot made from just inside the penalty area. Following the match, Oliver Kahn announced his retirement from the Germany national team. Throughout his international career he earned 86 caps for Germany, including 49 as team captain. He never won a World Cup, but finished as runner-up in 2002 and third in 2006.

== Media ==
Due to his performances during the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, Kahn gained popularity in Asia. He was depicted in several television commercials, including one for the Shinkin bank. In 2008, his wax figure in the Berlin branch of the Madame Tussaud museum was inaugurated. Kahn is the subject of the song &quot;Olli Kahn&quot; by the German pop group Die Prinzen.

In 2015, the arcade game company Konami announced that Kahn would feature in their football video game &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 2016&quot; as one of the new myClub Legends.

=== Television career ===

After the 2008 UEFA European Football Championship, he joined the ZDF sports team as an analyst for the Germany national team&#x27;s games. In 2009, he was part of the jury of a China Central Television reality show, which aimed to find China&#x27;s best young goalkeeper. As of 2011, he started negotiations with television channel Sat.1 to introduce the same format to German television under the name &quot;Never give up – The Kahn Principle&quot;, in which the winner would receive a contract to play for a Bundesliga club.

== Bayern Munich management ==
On 30 August 2019, it was revealed that Kahn would join the executive board of FC Bayern Munich on 1 January 2020. On 1 June 2021, it was announced that Kahn would take over the CEO position at Bayern Munich starting 1 July 2021, succeeding retiring Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Kahn was sacked as CEO on 27 May 2023.

== Personal life ==
Kahn was born in Karlsruhe. He is partly of Latvian descent; his father Rolf was born in Liepāja in 1943, where he remains well-known, to a Latvian mother, Ērika Alksne, and a Baltic German father, also named Rolf. Rolf briefly played professionally for Karlsruher SC, as did his son Axel, Oliver Kahn&#x27;s older brother.

In 2009, he was offered the position of manager for the FC Schalke 04, which he turned down. Two years thereafter, in April 2011, a German court fined Kahn €125,000 ($182,223) for tax evasion after failing to declare more than €6,000 of luxury clothing he bought on a trip to Dubai.

He supports the Munich street-football league &quot;Bunt kickt gut&quot;, which is considered a pioneer project of organised street-football and a Germany and Europe-wide model of intercultural understanding, education values and prevention; the Sepp-Herberger foundation, which promotes football in schools, clubs, and prisons; and the Justin Rockola Association, whose goal is the protection of young people against violence, alcohol and drugs.

He received his coaching licence in 2010. After having studied business at the Privatuniversität Schloss Seeburg Kahn obtained a Master of Business Administration degree in 2012. His thesis topic was &quot;Strategic management in Germany&#x27;s professional football&quot;.

=== Relationships ===
In 1999, Kahn married Simone, with whom he has two children: Katharina-Maria (born 28 December 1998) and David (born 7 March 2003). The couple separated in 2003 and Kahn thereafter had a highly publicised relationship with Verena Kerth from 2003 to 2008. Kahn and Simone briefly reconciled in 2009, before divorcing the same year.

On 8 July 2011, Kahn married his girlfriend Svenja in Munich. The couple have a son, born in 2011.

== Style of play ==

Regarded as one of the greatest and most successful goalkeepers of all time, in addition to his goalkeeping technique, agility, reflexes, distribution, command of his area, and shot-stopping abilities, Kahn is widely admired for the stamina, mental strength, and composure he showed to overcome the stresses and pressures of his career. His profile on the Bayern Munich website lists his attributes as &quot;impatient, disciplined, ambitious&quot;.

Kahn was known for his eccentricity and charismatic leadership from the back, which often saw him call out his defenders whenever they made errors. Due to the formidable presence, commanding influence, and aggressive playing style that he showed in goal during his professional career, Kahn&#x27;s epithet is &quot;The Titan&quot;; he was also frequently nicknamed &quot;King Kahn&quot; throughout his career.

<text>Educational Testing Service (ETS), founded in 1947, is the world&#x27;s largest private educational testing and assessment organization. It is headquartered in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, but has a Princeton address.

ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K–12 and higher education, and it also administers international tests including the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language), TOEIC (Test of English for International Communication), Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General and Subject Tests, and The Praxis test Series—in more than 180 countries, and at over 9,000 locations worldwide. Many of the assessments it develops are associated with entry to US tertiary (undergraduate) and quaternary education (graduate) institutions, but it also develops K–12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states, including California, Texas, Tennessee, and Virginia. In total, ETS annually administers 50 million exams in the U.S. and in 180 other countries.

==History==
ETS is a U.S.-registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization created in 1947 by three other nonprofit educational institutions: the American Council on Education (ACE), The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and The College Entrance Examination Board. ETS was formed in 1947 to take over the testing activities of its founders (whose organizations were not well suited to running operational assessment programs), and to pursue research intended to advance educational measurement and education. Among other things, ACE gave to the new organization the Cooperative Test Service and the National Teachers Examination; Carnegie gave the GRE; and the College Board turned over to ETS the operation (but not ownership) of the SAT for graduating high school students.

In 2024 the company established massive layoffs. In June, the company &quot;offered voluntary buyouts to every U.S. employee with more than two years of service.&quot; It was the fifth round of layoffs in five years. 

==Scientific contributions==

In keeping with the purposes for which it was established, ETS developed a program of research that covered not only measurement and education but also such related areas as statistics, educational evaluation, and psychology, particularly cognitive, developmental, personality, and social psychology. This broad-based research program attracted many individuals who distinguished themselves in their fields, often while at ETS but also in subsequent professorial positions. Among the more influential scientists have been Harold Gulliksen (whose book, &quot;Theory of Mental Tests&quot;, helped codify classical test theory); Frederic Lord (item response theory); Samuel Messick (modern validity theory); Robert Linn (known for testing and educational policy); Norman Frederiksen (performance assessment); Ledyard Tucker (test analysis, including inventing the &quot;Angoff Method&quot; of standard setting); Donald Rubin (missing data and causal modeling from observational data); Karl Jöreskog (structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis); Paul Holland (differential item functioning, test equating, causal modeling); Howard Wainer (differential item functioning, Testlet Response Theory, statistical graphics); John Carroll (language testing and cognitive psychology); Michael Lewis (infant cognitive, social, and emotional development); Irving Sigel (children&#x27;s cognitive development); Herman Witkin (cognitive and learning styles); K. Patricia Cross (adult education); Samuel Ball (an evaluation researcher who documented the positive educational effects of Sesame Street); David Rosenhan (known for the Rosenhan experiment, which challenged the validity of psychiatric diagnosis); Jeanne Brooks-Gunn (the effects of poverty on infant, child, and adolescent development); Robert J. Mislevy (Evidence-Centered Design); and Anthony Carnevale (education and the workforce).

Members of the ETS staff have been among the presidents of the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME); the Psychometric Society; the Measurement and Evaluation Division of the American Educational Research Association (AERA); the Evaluation, Measurement and Statistics Division of the American Psychological Association (APA); the APA Developmental Psychology Division; and the Jean Piaget Society. They have been among the executive editors of the &quot;Journal of Educational Measurement&quot;, &quot;Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics&quot;, &quot;Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis&quot;, &quot;Journal of Educational Psychology&quot;, &quot;Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology&quot;, and &quot;Discourse Processes&quot;. Major citations received while on staff have included elected membership to the National Academy of Education (K. Patricia Cross, 1975; Gregory Anrig, 1981; Paul Holland, 2005; Randy E. Bennett, 2022; Irwin Kirsch, 2022); (the APA Distinguished Contributions to Knowledge Award (Norman Frederiksen, 1984), the APA Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award (Frederic Lord, 1988; Howard Wainer, 2009); the AERA E.F. Lindquist Award (William Turnbull, 1981; Frederic Lord, 1988; Samuel Messick, 1994; Paul Holland, 2000; Wendy Yen, 2008; Howard Wainer, 2015; Charles Lewis, 2018; Randy E. Bennett, 2020); the NCME Career Contributions to Educational Measurement Award (Frederic Lord, 1990; Paul Holland, 2004; Howard Wainer, 2007; Neil Dorans, 2010; Linda Cook, 2017; Shelby Haberman, 2019); The Psychometric Society&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award (Howard Wainer, 2013), and the Jean Piaget Society&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award (Irving Sigel, 2002); among many other awards.

ETS has produced both new knowledge and methodology, especially in measurement and statistics, much of which has been taken up by assessment organizations around the world. Among the key scientific contributions were:

*co-invention of item response theory, an integrated framework for asking and answering a variety of practical problems related to the design and analysis of tests;
*creation of an approach and software for structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis (LISREL), used throughout the social sciences to test theoretical relationships among variables;
*seminal contributions to modern validity theory, including the idea that validity was a unitary concept and that the evaluation of score meaning requires consideration of the consequences of test use as those consequences may imply functional problems with the test;
*development of widely used approaches to data analysis when there are missing data;
*generation of approaches to causal modeling from observational data;
*invention of the In-Basket Test (used throughout the world to assess applicants for managerial jobs in a wide variety of industries);
*development of methods for detecting test unfairness, including invention of the Standardization approach to Differential Item Functioning (DIF) and application of the Mantel-Haenszel method;
*creation of the holistic-scoring approach to writing assessment, a means of rapidly and reliably judging the quality of essay text, which allowed direct writing assessment to become a more affordable alternative to multiple-choice questions for large-scale testing programs;
*development of research-based procedures and standards for occupational licensing and certification.

==Current status==

ETS&#x27; international headquarters is located on a campus outside of Princeton, New Jersey in Lawrence Township, Mercer County; processing, shipping, customer service and test security is in nearby Ewing. ETS also has a major office in San Antonio, Texas, which houses its K–12 Assessment Programs division, and smaller offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Washington, DC, Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, Sacramento, and Monterey, California. Overseas office locations, all of which are associated with for-profit subsidiaries that are wholly owned by ETS, include Amsterdam (ETS Global BV headquarters), London (ETS Global BV), Seoul (ETS Global BV), Paris (ETS Global BV), Amman (ETS Global BV), Warsaw (ETS Global BV), Beijing (ETS China), Delhi (ETS India) and Kingston, Ontario (ETS Canada). Not including its for-profit subsidiaries, ETS employs about 2,700 individuals, including 240 with doctorates and an additional 350 others with &quot;higher degrees.&quot;

To help support its nonprofit educational mission, ETS, like many other nonprofits, conducts business activities that are unrelated to that mission (e.g., employment testing). Under US tax law, these activities may be conducted (within limits) by the nonprofit itself, or by for-profit subsidiaries. Most of the &quot;off-mission&quot; work conducted by ETS is carried out by wholly owned, for-profit subsidiaries, including ETS Global BV, which contains much of the international operations of the company, ETS China, ETS India and ETS Canada.

About 25% of the work carried out by ETS is contracted by the College Board, a private, nonprofit membership association of universities, colleges, school districts, and secondary schools. The most popular and well-known of the College Board&#x27;s tests is the SAT, taken by more than 3 million students annually. ETS also supports The College Board&#x27;s Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT) and administers the Advanced Placement program, which is widely used in US high schools for advanced course credit.

Since 1983, ETS has conducted the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), known as the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Report Card&quot;, under contract to the US National Center for Education Statistics. NAEP is the only nationally representative and continuing assessment of what US students know and can do. ETS is responsible for coordination among the nine NAEP Alliance contractors, for item development, and for design, data analysis, and reporting.

In addition to the contract work that ETS undertakes for nonprofit and government entities like the College Board, the National Center for Education Statistics, and state education departments, the organization offers its own tests. These tests include the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) (for graduate and professional school admissions), the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) (for post-secondary admissions), the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) (for use by business and industry), and the Praxis Series (for teacher licensure and certification).

In England and Wales, ETS Europe, a unit of the ETS Global for-profit subsidiary, was contracted to mark and process the National Curriculum assessments on behalf of the government. ETS Global took over this role in 2008 from Edexcel, a subsidiary of Pearson, which had encountered significant and repeated problems in carrying out the marking and processing contract. As was the case for Edexcel, The first year of ETS Global&#x27;s operation was struck by a number of problems, including the late arrival of scripts to examiners, a database of student entries being unavailable, and countrywide reports of problems with the marking of the papers. The opposition Conservative Party (Tory) criticized the awarding of the contracts to ETS, and produced a dossier listing previous problems with ETS&#x27;s service. The ETS contract with the QCA was terminated in August 2008, with an agreement to pay back £19.5m and cancel invoices worth £4.6m. Subsequently, the contract for National Curriculum assessment marking and processing was again awarded to Edexcel. Like the two prior contracts, the Edexcel contract has encountered significant quality problems and the tests themselves, the focus of longstanding controversy in the English education community and among the public, have been subjected to a massive boycott by schools.

In 2009, ETS released the My Credentials Vault Service with Interfolio, Inc to &quot;simplify the entire letter of recommendation process&quot;.

==Criticism==

ETS has been criticized for being a &quot;highly competitive business operation that is as much multinational monopoly as nonprofit institution&quot;. Due to its legal status as a non-profit organization, ETS is exempt from paying federal corporate income tax on many, but not all, of its operations. It annually reports detailed financial information to the IRS on Form 990, which is publicly available.

In response to growing criticism of its monopolistic power, New York state passed the Educational Testing Act, a disclosure law which required ETS to make available certain test questions and graded answer sheets to students.

Problems administering England&#x27;s national tests in 2008 by ETS Europe were the subject of thousands of complaints recorded by the Times Educational Supplement. Their operations were also described as a &quot;shambles&quot; in the UK Parliament, where a financial penalty was called for. Complaints included papers not being marked properly, or not being marked at all and papers being sent to the wrong schools or lost completely. It has even been suggested that the quality of service is so poor that the Department for Children, Schools and Families (formerly the Department for Education and Skills) might not be able to publish the 2008 league tables of school performance. However, the contract was ended by &quot;mutual consent&quot;. The UK government asked Lord Sutherland to conduct an inquiry into the failure of the 2008 tests. The report included in its main findings:

&quot;• primary responsibility for this summer&#x27;s delivery failure rests with ETS Global BV, which won the public contract to deliver the tests;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;• ETS&#x27;s capacity to deliver the contract proved to be insufficient. A lack of comprehensive planning and testing by ETS of its systems and processes was a key factor in the delivery failure;&quot;

In 1983, students of James A. Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, California, achieved unexpectedly high exam results on the ETS Advanced Placement Exam. ETS implied that the students may have cheated to obtain such results based on common mistakes across different exams. The students were required to prove their abilities and innocence by taking a second exam, which they did successfully.

Americans for Educational Testing Reform (AETR) claims that ETS is violating its non-profit status through excessive profits, executive compensation, and governing board member pay (which the IRS specifically advises against). AETR further claims that ETS is acting unethically by selling test preparation materials, directly lobbying legislators and government officials, and refusing to acknowledge test-taker rights. It also criticises ETS for forcing GRE test-takers to participate in research experiments during the actual exam. 

In 2014 the BBC reported that the Home Office has suspended English language tests run by ETS after a BBC investigation uncovered systematic fraud in the student visa system. Secret filming of government-approved English exams needed for a visa showed entire rooms of candidates having the tests faked for them.

<doc id="347553" wikidata="Q899409" url="?curid=347553" title="Gens">
<text>In ancient Rome, a gens ( or , ; : gentes ) was a family consisting of individuals who shared the same &quot;nomen gentilicium&quot; and who claimed descent from a common ancestor. A branch of gens, sometimes identified by a distinct cognomen, was called a &quot;stirps&quot; (: &quot;stirpes&quot;). The gens was an important social structure at Rome and throughout &quot;Italia&quot; during the period of the Roman Republic. Much of individuals&#x27; social standing depended on the gens to which they belonged. Certain gentes were classified as patrician, others as plebeian; some had both patrician and plebeian branches. The importance of the gens as a social structure declined considerably in imperial times, although the &quot;gentilicium&quot; continued to define the origins and dynasties of the ancient Romans, including the emperors.

==Origins==
The word &quot;gens&quot; is sometimes translated as &quot;race&quot;, or &quot;nation&quot;, meaning a people descended from a common ancestor (rather than sharing a common physical trait). It can also be translated as &quot;clan&quot;, &quot;kin&quot;, or &quot;tribe&quot;, although the word &quot;tribus&quot; has a separate and distinct meaning in Roman culture. A gens could be as small as a single family, or could include hundreds of individuals. According to tradition, in 479 BC the Fabia gens alone were able to field a militia consisting of three hundred and six men of fighting age. The concept of the gens was not uniquely Roman, but was shared with communities throughout Italy, including those who spoke Italic languages such as Latin, Oscan, and Umbrian as well as the Etruscans, whose language was unrelated. All of these peoples were eventually absorbed into the sphere of Roman culture.

The oldest gentes were said to have originated before the foundation of Rome (traditionally 753 BC), and claimed descent from mythological personages as far back as the time of the Trojan War (traditionally ended 1184 BC). However, the establishment of the gens cannot long predate the adoption of hereditary surnames. The &quot;nomen gentilicium&quot;, or &quot;gentile name&quot;, was its distinguishing feature, for a Roman citizen&#x27;s nomen indicated his membership in a gens.

The nomen could be derived from any number of things, such as the name of an ancestor, a person&#x27;s occupation, physical appearance, character, or town of origin. Because some of these things were fairly common, it was possible for unrelated families to bear the same nomen, and over time to become confused.

Persons could be adopted into a gens and acquire its nomen. A &quot;libertus&quot;, or &quot;freedman&quot;, usually assumed the nomen (and sometimes also the praenomen) of the person who had manumitted him, and a naturalized citizen usually took the name of the patron who granted his citizenship. Freedmen and newly enfranchised citizens were not technically part of the gentes whose names they shared, but within a few generations it often became impossible to distinguish their descendants from the original members. In practice this meant that a gens could acquire new members and even new branches, either by design or by accident.

===Stirpes===
Different branches or &quot;stirpes&quot; of a gens were usually distinguished by their cognomina, additional surnames following the nomen, which could be either personal or hereditary. Some particularly large stirpes themselves became divided into multiple branches, distinguished by additional cognomina.

===Praenomina===
Most gentes regularly employed a limited number of personal names, or &quot;praenomina&quot;, the selection of which helped to distinguish members of one gens from another. Sometimes different branches of a gens would vary in their names of choice. The most conservative gentes would sometimes limit themselves to three or four praenomina, while others made regular use of six or seven.

There were two main reasons for this limited selection: first, it was traditional to pass down family names from one generation to the next; such names were always preferred. Second, most patrician families limited themselves to a small number of names as a way of distinguishing themselves from the plebeians, who often employed a wider variety of names, including some that were seldom used by the patricians. However, several of the oldest and most noble patrician houses frequently used rare and unusual praenomina.

Certain families also deliberately avoided particular praenomina. In at least some cases, this was because of traditions concerning disgraced or dishonoured members of the gens bearing a particular name. For example, the Junia gens avoided the praenomina &quot;Titus&quot; and &quot;Tiberius&quot; after two members with these names were executed for treason. A similar instance supposedly led the assembly of the Manlia gens to forbid its members from bearing the praenomen &quot;Marcus&quot;, although this prohibition does not seem to have been strictly observed.

==Social function of the gens==
In theory, each gens functioned as a state within a state, governed by its own elders and assemblies, following its own customs, and carrying out its own religious rites. Certain cults were traditionally associated with specific gentes. The gentile assemblies had the responsibility of adoption and guardianship for their members. If a member of a gens died and without immediate family, his property was distributed to the rest of the gens.

The decisions of a gens were theoretically binding on all of its members. However, no public enactment is recorded as having been passed by the assembly of a gens. As a group, the gentes had considerable influence on the development of Roman law and religious practices, but comparatively little influence on the political and constitutional history of Rome.

==Patrician and plebeian gentes==
Certain gentes were considered patrician, and others plebeian. According to tradition, the patricians were descended from the &quot;city fathers&quot;, or &quot;patres&quot;; that is, the heads of the family at the time of its foundation by Romulus, the first King of Rome. Other noble families which came to Rome during the time of the kings were also admitted to the patriciate, including several who emigrated from Alba Longa after that city was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius. The last known instance of a gens being admitted to the patriciate prior to the first century BC was when the Claudii were added to the ranks of the patricians after coming to Rome in 504 BC, five years after the establishment of the Republic.

Numerous sources describe two classes amongst the patrician gentes, known as the &quot;gentes maiores&quot;, or major gentes, and the &quot;gentes minores&quot;, or minor gentes. No definite information has survived concerning which families were numbered amongst the gentes maiores, or even how many there were. However, they almost certainly included the Aemilii, Claudii, Cornelii, Fabii, Manlii, and Valerii. Nor is it certain whether this distinction was of any practical importance, although it has been suggested that the &quot;princeps senatus&quot;, or speaker of the Senate, was usually chosen from their number.

For the first several decades of the Republic, it is not entirely certain which gentes were considered patrician and which plebeian. However, a series of laws promulgated in 451 and 450 BC as the Twelve Tables attempted to codify a rigid distinction between the classes, formally excluding the plebeians from holding any of the major magistracies from that time until the passage of the &quot;Lex Licinia Sextia&quot; in 367 BC. Another law promulgated as part of the tables forbade the intermarriage of patricians and plebeians, but this was repealed after only a few years, by the &quot;Lex Canuleia&quot; in 445 BC.

Despite the formal reconciliation of the orders in 367, the patrician houses, which as time passed represented a smaller and smaller percentage of the Roman populace, continued to hold on to as much power as possible, resulting in frequent conflict between the orders over the next two centuries. Certain patrician families regularly opposed the sharing of power with the plebeians, while others favoured it, and some were divided.

Many gentes included both patrician and plebeian branches. These may have arisen through adoption or manumission, or when two unrelated families bearing the same nomen became confused. It may also be that individual members of a gens voluntarily left or were expelled from the patriciate, along with their descendants. In some cases, gentes that must originally have been patrician, or which were so regarded during the early Republic, were later known only by their plebeian descendants.

By the first century BC, the practical distinction between the patricians and the plebeians was largely symbolic, with only a few priesthoods and ceremonial offices restricted to patricians. However, such was their prestige that, beginning with the administration of Caesar, and continuing into imperial times, a number of families were raised to the patriciate, replacing older families that had become extinct or faded into obscurity, and which were no longer represented in the Roman senate. By the third century, the distinction between patricians and plebeians had lost its relevance. The emperor Constantine and his successors revived the title as a mark of distinction granted to individuals, rather than a class to which an entire family belonged.

<doc id="347556" wikidata="Q5329554" url="?curid=347556" title="East Touch">
<text>East Touch () is a weekly Chinese language magazine written in Cantonese style in Hong Kong. It is published every Tuesday by East Touch Publishing Limited, part of Global China Group Holdings Limited.

==Content==
&quot;East Touch&quot; is an infotainment publication targeting readers aged between 20 and 30. It covers stories of celebrities, entertainment news, fashion trends and lifestyle topics. A survey conducted by the Society for Truth and Light in Hong Kong showed that about 86.6% of the content of &quot;East Touch&quot; is related to information about entertainment and consumption. According to the editorial board, the magazine regards men&#x27;s fashion news as its top priority, followed by women&#x27;s fashion news and lifestyle reports. Entertainment news is regarded as the least important priority.

==Reporting style==
The reporting style of &quot;East Touch&quot; follows four guiding principles established by its owners. These four reporting principles distinguish &quot;East Touch&quot; from other magazines targeted at trendy young people. 

The magazine&#x27;s competitors, namely, &quot;Easy Finder&quot;, &quot;East Week&quot; and &quot;3 Magazine&quot; place considerably more emphasis on paparazzi-type entertainment scoops and Category IIB photos of starlets. This is confirmed by statistics provided by the Hong Kong Press Council and the Hong Kong Journalists Association which show that no complaints have been filed nor condemnations issued against &quot;East Touch&quot;.

==Big events==
&quot;East Touch&quot; faced the first great challenge in its colourful history when its 42nd issue was published on 29 March 1995. The magazine was convicted and fined by the courts for publishing indecent articles about pornography, thereby falling foul of the Obscene Articles Tribunal and the Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority. The article judged indecent concerned a &quot;Festival of Pornography&quot;, in which many sexual utilities and services were advertised without an accompanying warning that the magazine contained material which should not fall into the hands of persons under the age of 18. According to both the Tribunal and the Supreme Court, such an omission violated the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal made by the publisher in July 1996.

==Readership==
To date, no official figures have been published on the magazine&#x27;s circulation numbers and market penetration. According to a survey of the reading habits of 15- to 29-year-olds in Hong Kong conducted by Breakthrough, a non-profit Christian youth organisation in Hong Kong, in February 1999, however, &quot;East Touch&quot; lagged behind its closest competitors. In the survey, &quot;Next Magazine&quot;, &quot;Easy Finder&quot; and &quot;East Week&quot; ranked top three, with 32.3%, 27.4% and 24.9% respectively.

==Writing style, layout and logo==
Articles in &quot;East Touch&quot; are written in colloquial Chinese and are often peppered with slangy Cantonese phrases and English words. The layout of the magazine is very colourful with photos, pictures and graphics taking up equal, if not more, page space than words. The magazine&#x27;s layout changes frequently to maintain freshness and to avoid any &#x27;detachment&#x27; between authors and readers. However, such oral–oriented written discourse has been accused of polluting Modern Standard Chinese, and has been blamed by teachers and educators for the deteriorating language proficiency of Hong Kong&#x27;s youngsters. 

&quot;East Touch&quot; also makes frequent changes to the appearance and organisation of its contents, though the contents themselves remain largely the same. When it was first published, the magazine was unitary and was divided into four sections, namely &#x27;First touch&#x27;, &#x27;Entertainment touch&#x27;, &#x27;Fashion &amp; City touch&#x27; and &#x27;Keep in touch&#x27;.

&quot;East Touch&quot; launched the present logo with Issue 437, which came out on 14 October 2003. This new logo, incorporating the Chinese character &quot;East&quot; (東)with the English words &quot;East Touch&quot;, was chosen to reflect the magazine&#x27;s very first logo. Before the present logo was launched, &quot;East Touch&quot; had changed the design of its logo six times.

==Sub-booklets==
A number of sub-booklets were subsequently published together with the main book.
*&#x27;Shopping G-Point&#x27; (購物G點) was first issued with the 125th issue in conjunction with &#x27;G-Point Price&#x27;(G點價), which provided discounts for readers buying trendy clothes, sneakers and accessories.
*With the 153rd issue, &#x27;Game Century&#x27; (Game世紀) was published. This introduced the latest computer and video games and taught readers how to become skilful players. This later changed its name to &#x27;Electric-king&#x27;(電click王) with the 285th issue, and covered topics on a wide range of electrical appliances. 
*&#x27;Look&#x27; was first issued with the 285th issue, and focused on fashion and lifestyle topics.
*&#x27;Sneakers&#x27;(波鞋王) was first issued with the 317th issue, and introduced trends, design, brands and the price of sneakers.
*&#x27;Make-up Garden&#x27;(妝苑) was first issued with the 317th issue, and included make-up tips, make-up demonstrations, a new cosmetics product review and interviews with artists and models.
*&#x27;Brands&#x27;(東Touch別注) was first issued with the 348th issue, and introduced brand products in fashion.
*&#x27;Cat&#x27;s&#x27; was first issued with the 355th issue, and mainly contained stylish pictures of the latest fashion products.
*&#x27;OK!week&#x27;(OK一周) was first issued with the 370th issue, and reported the hottest entertainment news of the previous week.
*&#x27;Green weekly&#x27; was first issued with the 390th issue, and focused on fashion trends.

==Sections==
&quot;East Touch&quot; is divided into two books. The main book has five sections, namely &quot;Begin&quot;, &quot;Entertainment&quot;, &quot;Babe&quot;, &quot;Knock&quot;, and &quot;Relax&quot;.
*&quot;Begin&quot; section discusses the hottest topics from around the world during the previous week in the relaxed tone generally found in infotainment magazines.
*&quot;Entertainment&quot; section reports on recent local and international entertainment news. This includes interviews with celebrities, features on upcoming movies and TV series, and CD reviews.
*&quot;Babe&quot; section contains the latest trends in female fashion and make-up. This section includes interviews with trend-setting singers, artists, models, designers and stylists; style photos; and features on the latest fashion products. A recent addition to this section has been an interview series by popular local DJ&#x27;s(茜利妹)with some local celebrities on sex-related topics.
*&quot;Knock&quot; section focuses on trends for men. It includes features on selected male fashion labels; style photos of the latest male fashions; reports on male trend icons, such as Quentin Tarantino, the director of &quot;Kill Bill&quot;; and product information on the latest sneakers in town.
*&quot;Relax&quot; section does not have a particular theme. It provides information on high-tech gadgets, toys and comics. A special periodical in this section is &lt;Green&gt; which features local university student life.

The sub-booklet has four sections. It focuses on the latest products and presents them in a catalogue format detailing prices and retail outlets.
*&quot;Brand name Trends&quot; contains information on products by selected fashion labels; columns on how to maintain brandname products; street snapshots of people with brandname products; rankings of the &quot;hippest&quot; brandname products; and an &quot;Exchange forum&quot; for readers to buy or sell second-hand brandname products.
*&quot;Technological Trends&quot; features the latest hi-tech gadgets together with detailed descriptions of their functions, prices and points of sale. This section also includes rankings of the hippest mobile phones and digital cameras.
*&quot;Health Trends&quot; contains information on diet plans, health foods and exercise plans.
*&quot;Information Weekly&quot; has a weekly horoscope, a comic series, a movie review, a CD review and articles by different contributors.

==Recent strategy==
In recent issues, &quot;East Touch&quot; has followed the practice of other trend magazines by issuing a small booklets on selected high-fashion labels. These booklets focus on clothes and accessories from a particular brand, along with prices and shop details. It occasionally offers readers free gifts, a typical example being the 100 sets of block toys offered to readers with the 349th issue to celebrate Valentine&#x27;s Day.

A frequent advertising technique employed by &quot;East Touch&quot; is its use of soft marketing. Advertisements are often presented in formats similar to the feature articles with &quot;Information provided by clients&quot; (資料由客戶提供) in small print at the top of the page to indicate that it is an advertisement.

==Name==
The idea of naming the magazine &quot;East Touch&quot; came from the phase &quot;Don&#x27;t touch&quot;. According to the editorial board, the sub-booklet aimed at inspiring readers to be &quot;rebellious&quot;, to &quot;challenge everything&quot;, and to be concerned with the world. according to this philosophy, the first thing to do is &quot;to touch&quot;. Thus, the Board used the word &quot;Touch&quot; as a part of the sub-booklet&#x27;s name. The Chinese word &quot;East&quot;(東) is a pun of the pronunciation of the English word &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot; in the Cantonese-accented English of the then owner Oriental Press Group Limited (東方報業集團有限公司 Pinyin: Dōngfāng Bàoyè Jítuán Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī).

==Changes to day of publication==
&quot;East Touch&quot; was published every Tuesday for its first 303 issues. The day of publication changed to Sunday with the 304th issue. It was then, for a brief period from the 348th issue to the 354th issue, released on Wednesdays. It has again been issued on Tuesdays from the 355th issue to date.

==Reputation==
Cathay Pacific Airways has chosen &quot;East Touch&quot; to be one of their in-flight magazines.

<doc id="347558" wikidata="Q1589814" url="?curid=347558" title="List of Hiberno-Saxon illuminated manuscripts">
<text>Hiberno-Saxon manuscripts are those manuscripts made in Ireland and Great Britain from about 500 CE to about 900 CE in England, but later in Ireland and elsewhere, or those manuscripts made on the continent in scriptoria founded by Hiberno-Scottish or Anglo-Saxon missionaries and which are stylistically similar to the manuscripts produced in Ireland and Britain. It is almost impossible to separate Anglo-Saxon, Irish, Scottish and Welsh art at this period, especially in manuscripts; this art is therefore called Insular art. See specifically Insular illumination and also Insular script. For English manuscripts produced after 900, see the List of illuminated Anglo-Saxon manuscripts.

<doc id="347560" wikidata="Q6033780" url="?curid=347560" title="Inheritance (genetic algorithm)">
<text>In genetic algorithms, inheritance is the ability of modeled objects to mate, mutate (similar to biological mutation), and propagate their problem solving genes to the next generation, in order to produce an evolved solution to a particular problem. The selection of objects that will be inherited from in each successive generation is determined by a fitness function, which varies depending upon the problem being addressed.

The traits of these objects are passed on through chromosomes by a means similar to biological reproduction. These chromosomes are generally represented by a series of genes, which in turn are usually represented using binary numbers. This propagation of traits between generations is similar to the inheritance of traits between generations of biological organisms. This process can also be viewed as a form of reinforcement learning, because the evolution of the objects is driven by the passing of traits from successful objects which can be viewed as a reward for their success, thereby promoting beneficial traits.

== Process ==
Once a new generation is ready to be created, all of the individuals that have been successful and have been chosen for reproduction are randomly paired together. Then the traits of these individuals are passed on through a combination of crossover and mutation. This process follows these basic steps:

# Pair off successful objects for mating.
# Determine randomly a crossover point for each pair.
# Switch the genes after the crossover point in each pair.
# Determine randomly if any genes are mutated in the child objects.

After following these steps, two child objects will be produced for every pair of parent objects used. Then, after determining the success of the objects in the new generation, this process can be repeated using whichever new objects were most successful. This will usually be repeated until either a desired generation is reached or an object that meets a minimum desired result from the fitness function is found.

While crossover and mutation are the common genetic operators used in inheritance, there are also other operators such as regrouping and colonization-extinction.

=== Example ===
Assume these two strings of bits represent the traits being passed on by two parent objects:

* Object 1: 1100011010110001
* Object 2: 1001100110011001

Now, consider that the crossover point is randomly positioned after the fifth bit:

* Object 1: 11000 | 11010110001
* Object 2: 10011 | 00110011001

During crossover, the two objects will swap all of the bits after the crossover point, leading to:

* Object 1: 11000 | 00110011001
* Object 2: 10011 | 11010110001

Finally, mutation is simulated on the objects by there being zero or more bits flipped randomly. Assuming the tenth bit for object 1 is mutated, and the second and seventh bits are mutated for object 2, the final children produced by this inheritance would be:

* Object 1: 1100000111011001
* Object 2: 1101110010110001

<text>Jonathan Adolf Wilhelm Zenneck (; ; 15 April 1871 – 8 April 1959) was a German physicist and electrical engineer. 

Zenneck improved the cathode-ray tube by adding a second deflection structure at right angles to the first, which allowed two-dimensional viewing of a waveform. This two-dimensional display is fundamental to the oscilloscope.

==Early years==
Zenneck was born in Ruppertshofen, Württemberg.

In 1885, Zenneck entered the Evangelical-Theological Seminary in Maulbronn. In 1887, while in a Blaubeuren seminary, Zenneck learned Latin, Greek, French, and Hebrew. In 1889, Zenneck enrolled in the University of Tübingen. At the Tübingen Seminary, he studied mathematics and natural sciences. In 1894, Zenneck took the state examination in mathematics and natural sciences and the examination for his doctor&#x27;s degree. His dissertation, supervised by Theodor Eimer, was on grass snake embryos.

In 1894, Zenneck conducted zoological research (Natural History Museum, London). Between 1894 and 1895, he served in the military.

==Middle years==
In 1895, Zenneck left zoology and turned over to the new field of radio science, He became assistant to Ferdinand Braun and lecturer at &quot;Physikalisches Institut&quot; in Strasbourg, Alsace. Nikola Tesla&#x27;s lectures introduced him to the wireless sciences. In 1899, Zenneck started propagation studies of wireless telegraphy, first over land, but then became more interested in the larger ranges that were reached over sea. In 1900 he started ship-to-coast experiments in the North Sea near Cuxhaven, Germany. in 1902 he conducted tests of directional antennas. In 1905, Zenneck left Strasbourg since he was appointed assistant-professor at the Danzig Technische Hochschule and in 1906, he became professor of experimental physics in the Braunschweig Technische Hochschule. Also in 1906, Zenneck wrote &quot;Electromagnetic Oscillations and Wireless Telegraphy&quot;, the then standard textbook on the subject). In 1909, he joined Badische Anilin und Sodafabrik in Ludwigshafen to experiment with electrical discharges in air to produce bound nitrogen as fertilizer. In 1913, he became director of the newly created Physics Institute of the Technische Hochschule München.

Zenneck analyzed solutions to Maxwell&#x27;s equations that are localized around an interface between a conducting medium and a non-conducting medium. In these solutions, the electric field strength decays exponentially in each medium as distance from the interface increases. These waves are sometimes called Zenneck waves. Zenneck analyzed plane wave solutions having this property; he also analyzed solutions with cylindrical symmetry having this property.

==Later years==
Around World War I, Zenneck served on the front-lines as a captain in the Marines. However, in 1914, the German government sent him and Karl Ferdinand Braun to the United States as technical advisor in a patent case involving Telefunken. The US Marconi Company sued Telefunken for patent infringement, a case spurred by the British government in an attempt to shut down transatlantic wireless telegraph between the US and Germany. The case stalled and event went moot when the United States entered the war, declaring Zenneck a Prisoner of War. He was dismissed only in 1920 when he could finally take over the professorship of experimental physics at the Technische Hochschule München. In that time he resumed propagation studies, now with shortwaves and was first in Germany to study the Ionosphere with vertical sounding at his station at Kochel/Bavaria. From the 1930s, Zenneck directed the Deutsches Museum in Munich, and rebuilt it after World War II. Zenneck was awarded the 1928 IRE Medal of Honor for his achievements in basic research on radio technology and for fostering academic and technical offspring he received the Siemens-Ring in 1956.

<text>International English Language Testing System (IELTS ) is an international standardized test of English language proficiency for non-native English language speakers. It is jointly managed by the British Council, IDP and Cambridge English, and was established in 1989. IELTS is one of the major English-language tests in the world. The IELTS test has two modules: Academic and General Training. IELTS One Skill Retake was introduced for computer-delivered tests in 2023, which allows a test taker to retake any one section (Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking) of the test.

IELTS is accepted by most Australian, British, Canadian, European, Irish and New Zealand academic institutions, by over 3,000 academic institutions in the United States, and by various professional organisations across the world.

IELTS is approved by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) as a Secure English Language Test for visa applicants only inside the UK. It also meets requirements for immigration to Australia, where Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and Pearson Test of English Academic are also accepted, and New Zealand. In Canada, IELTS, TEF, or CELPIP are accepted by the immigration authority.

No minimum score is required to pass the test. An IELTS result or Test Report Form is issued to all test takers with a score from &quot;Band 1&quot; (&quot;non-user&quot;) to &quot;Band 9&quot; (&quot;expert user&quot;) and each institution sets a different threshold. There is also a &quot;Band 0&quot; score for those who did not attempt the test. Institutions are advised not to consider a report older than two years to be valid, unless the user proves that they have worked to maintain their level.

In 2017, over 3 million tests were taken in more than 140 countries, up from 2 million tests in 2012, 1.7 million tests in 2011 and 1.4 million tests in 2009. In 2007, IELTS administered more than one million tests in a single 12-month period for the first time ever, making it the world&#x27;s most popular English language test for higher education and immigration.

In 2019, over 508,000 international students came to study in the UK, making it the world&#x27;s most popular UK ELT (English Language Test) destination. Over half (54%) of those students were under 18 years old.

==History==

The English Language Testing Service (ELTS), as IELTS was then known, was launched in 1980 by Cambridge English Language Assessment (then known as &quot;UCLES&quot;) and the British Council. It had an innovative format, which reflected changes in language learning and teaching, including the growth in &#x27;communicative&#x27; language learning and &#x27;English for specific purposes&#x27;. Test tasks were intended to reflect the use of English language in the &#x27;real world&#x27;.

During the 1980s, test taker numbers were low (4,000 in 1981 rising to 10,000 in 1985) and there were practical difficulties administering the test. As a result, the IELTS Revision Project was set up to oversee the redesign of the test. In order to have international participation in the redesign, the International Development Program of Australian Universities and Colleges (IDP), now known as IDP: IELTS Australia, joined Cambridge English Language Assessment and the British Council to form the international IELTS partnership which delivers the test to this day. This international partnership was reflected in the new name for the test: The International English Language Testing System (IELTS).

IELTS went live in 1989. Test takers took two non-specialised modules, Listening and Speaking, and two specialised modules, Reading and Writing. Test taker numbers rose by approximately 15% per year and by 1995 there were 43,000 test takers in 210 test centres around the world.

IELTS was revised again in 1995, with three main changes:
* There was one Academic Reading Module and one Academic Writing Module (previously there had been a choice of three field-specific Reading and Writing modules)
* The thematic link between the Reading and Writing tasks was removed to avoid confusing the assessment of reading and writing ability
* The General Training Reading and Writing modules were brought into line with the Academic Reading and Writing modules (same timing, length of responses, reporting of scores).

Further revisions went live in 2001 (revised Speaking Test) and 2005 (new assessment criteria for the Writing test).

==IELTS characteristics==

IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training are designed to cover the full range of abilities from non-user or middle user to expert user. The Academic version is for test takers who want to study at the tertiary level in an English-speaking country or seek professional registration. The General Training version is for test takers who want to work, train, study at a secondary school or migrate to an English-speaking country.

The difference between the Academic and General Training versions is the content, context, and purpose of the tasks. All other features, such as timing allocation, length of written responses, and reporting of scores, are the same.

IELTS Academic and General Training both incorporate the following features:
* IELTS tests the ability to , read, write and speak in English.
* The speaking module is a key component of IELTS. It is conducted in the form of a one-to-one interview with an examiner which can occur face to face or even through a video conference. The examiner assesses the test taker as they are speaking. The speaking session is also recorded for monitoring and for re-marking in case of an appeal against the score given.
* A variety of accents and writing styles have been presented in test materials in order to minimize linguistic bias. The accents in the listening section are generally 80% British, Australian, New Zealander and 20% others (mostly American).
* IELTS is developed by experts at Cambridge English Language Assessment with input from item writers from around the world. Teams are located in the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and other English-speaking nations.
* Band scores are used for each language sub-skill (Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking). They are averaged out to derive the overall band score for each test taker.

==IELTS test structure==

=== Modules ===
There are two modules of the IELTS:
* Academic Module
* General Training Module
There is also a separate test offered by the IELTS test partners, called IELTS Life Skills:

* IELTS Academic is intended for those who want to enroll in universities and other institutions of higher education and for professionals such as medical doctors, engineers and nurses who want to study or practice in an English-speaking country. Mainly for those who is trying for non-immigrant student visa.
* IELTS General Training is intended for those planning to undertake non-academic training or to gain work experience, or for immigration purposes.
* IELTS Life Skills is intended for those who need to prove their English speaking and listening skills at Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRR) levels A1 or B1 and can be used to apply for a &#x27;family of a settled person&#x27; visa, indefinite leave to remain or citizenship in the UK.

=== The four parts of the IELTS test ===

Note 1: Listening, Reading and Writing are completed in one sitting. The Speaking test may be taken on the same day or up to seven days before or after the other tests.

Note 2: All test takers take the same Listening and Speaking tests, while the Reading and Writing tests differ depending on whether the test taker is taking the Academic or General Training versions of the test.

Note 3: The 10 minutes transfer time is for the paper-based option of the test. For the computer-delivered option, candidates will be given 2 minutes (at the end of the test) to re-check their answers. 

==== Listening ====
The module comprises four sections, with ten questions in each section. It takes around 40 (paper-based) or 32 (computer-delivered) minutes: 30 for testing, plus 10 for transferring the answers to an answer sheet (paper-based) or 2 for re-checking the answers (computer-delivered).

Sections 1 and 2 are about everyday, social situations.
* Section 1 has a conversation between two speakers (for example, a conversation about travel arrangements)
* Section 2 has one person speaking (for example, a speech about local facilities).

Sections 3 and 4 are about educational and training situations
* Section 3 is a conversation between two main speakers (for example, a discussion between two university students, perhaps guided by a tutor)
* Section 4 has one person speaking about an academic subject.

Each section begins with a short introduction telling the test taker about the situation and the speakers. Then they have some time to look through the questions. The questions are in the same order as the information in the recording, so the answer to the first question will be before the answer to the second question, and so on. The first three sections have a break in the middle allowing test takers to look at the remaining questions. Each section is heard only once.

At the end of the test, candidates are given 10 minutes to transfer their answers to an answer sheet (if they take their test paper-based) or 2 minutes (at the end of the test of course) to re-check the answers (if they do so computer-delivered). Test takers will lose marks for incorrect spelling and grammar.

==== Reading ====
The Reading paper has three sections and texts totalling approximately 2,150–3,250 words. There will be a variety of question types, such as multiple-choice, short-answer questions, identifying information, identifying writer&#x27;s views, labelling diagrams, completing a summary using words taken from the text and matching information/headings/features in the text/sentence endings. Test takers should be careful when writing down their answers as they will lose marks for incorrect spelling and grammar.

Texts in IELTS Academic
* Three reading texts, which come from books, journals, magazines, newspapers and online resources written for non-specialist audiences. All the topics are of general interest to students at undergraduate or postgraduate level.

Texts in IELTS General Training
* Section 1 contains two or three short texts or several shorter texts, which deal with everyday topics. For example, timetables or notices – things a person would need to understand when living in an English-speaking country. 
* Section 2 contains two texts, which deal with work. For example, job descriptions, contracts, training materials.
* Section 3 contains one long text about a topic of general interest. The text is generally descriptive, longer and more complex than the texts in Sections 1 and 2. The text will be taken from a newspaper, magazine, book or online resource.

==== Writing ====
IELTS Academic
* Task 1: test takers describe a graph, table, chart, map, process, pie chart or diagram in their own words.
* Task 2: test takers discuss a point of view, argument, or problem. Depending on the task, test takers may be required to present a solution to a problem, present and justify an opinion, compare and contrast evidence, opinions and implications, and evaluate and challenge ideas, evidence or an argument.

IELTS General Training
* Task 1: test takers write a letter in response to a given everyday situation. For example, writing to an accommodation officer about problems with your accommodation, writing to a new employer about problems managing your time, or writing to a local newspaper about a plan to develop a local airport.
* Task 2: test takers write an essay about a topic of general interest. For example, whether smoking should be banned in public places, whether children&#x27;s leisure activities should be educational, or how environmental problems can be solved.

==== Speaking ====
The speaking test is a face-to-face interview between the test taker and an examiner.

The speaking test contains three sections. 
* Section 1: introduction and interview (4–5 minutes). Test takers may be asked about their home, family, work, studies, hobbies, interests, reasons for taking IELTS exam, and other general topics such as clothing, free time, computers, and the Internet. 
* Section 2: long turn (3–4 minutes). Test takers are given a task card about a particular topic. Test takers have one minute to prepare to talk about this topic. The task card states the points that should be included in the talk and one aspect of the topic which must be explained during the talk. Test takers are then expected to talk about the topic for one to two minutes, after which the examiner may ask one or two questions.
* Section 3: discussions (4–5 minutes). The third section involves a discussion between the examiner and the test taker, generally on questions relating to the theme which they have already spoken about in Section 2. These questions usually consist of two sets of four or five questions.

==Band scale and scoring==

Test takers receive a score for each test component – Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking. The individual scores are then averaged and rounded to produce an Overall Band Score.

There is no pass or fail. IELTS is scored on a nine-band scale, with each band corresponding to a specified competence in English. Overall Band Scores are reported to the nearest half band.

The following rounding convention applies: if the average across the four skills ends in .25, it is rounded up to the next half band, and if it ends in .75, it is rounded up to the next whole band.

The nine bands are described as follows:

===IELTS and the CEFR===

==Results==

For a computer-delivered test, results are released between 3–5 days. For a paper-based test, a Test Report Form will be sent to test takers 13 days after their test.

It shows:
* An Overall Band Score (from 1–9)
* A band score (from 1–9) for each section of the test (Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking)
* The test taker&#x27;s estimated CEFR level in the English language
* Whether IELTS Academic or General Training was completed
* Test date and the date that the certificate was signed
* Test report form number (15–18 characters as a mixture of numbers and capital letters)
* The test taker&#x27;s photo, sex (male/female), nationality, candidate ID, first and last name, first language and date of birth

Test takers receive one copy of their Test Report Form, apart from test takers who are applying to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) or UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) who receive two copies.

Test Report Forms are valid for two years.

==Locations and test dates==

Test takers can take IELTS in more than 140 countries and in over 4,000 locations.

There are up to 48 test dates available per year. Each test centre offers tests up to four times a month depending on local demand. The Academic version is available on all 48 dates per year and the General Training version is available on 24 dates.

There used to be a minimum time limit of 90 days before a person was allowed to retake the test. However this restriction has been withdrawn and currently there is no limit for applicants to retake the test.

==Level required by academic institutions for admission==
Just over half (51%) of test takers take IELTS to enter higher education in a foreign country. The IELTS minimum scores required by academic institutions and by course vary. As a general rule, the top ranked universities in the United States tend to require a higher IELTS band (typically 7.0). Most universities accept scores between 6–7 as being suitable for undergraduate study in English. Full details about the organizations which accept IELTS and the scores they require can be found on the IELTS Global Recognition System website.

==IELTS use for immigration purposes==

A number of Commonwealth countries use IELTS scores as a proof of prospective immigrants&#x27; competence in English.

Australia&#x27;s immigration authorities have used IELTS to assess English proficiency of prospective migrants since May 1998, when this test replaced the &#x27;access:&#x27; test that had been previously used.

There are different IELTS score requirements for different types of visa.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has used the IELTS test since 1995. There are different IELTS score requirements for different types of visa and type of applicant.

Originally, applicants who could not achieve the required score could pay a NZ$20,000 fee instead, which would be fully or partially refunded later if the migrant were able to successfully take the test within a certain period (3 to 12 months) after his or her arrival to the country. A few years later, the policy was changed: the fee was reduced, and, instead of being potentially refundable, it became treated as a &quot;pre-purchase&quot; of post-arrival ESL tuition.

===Canada===
Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) uses IELTS and/or TEF as evidence of one&#x27;s ability to communicate in English and/or French. The CELPIP (Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program) test scores are an alternative to IELTS.

The Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB) are the national standards used in Canada for describing, measuring and recognizing the English language proficiency of prospective immigrants. The following table shows the IELTS scores needed for each CLB level.

There are different language requirements for different types of immigration program as shown below:

Submitting one&#x27;s IELTS scores is also one of the several ways to prove one&#x27;s proficiency in an official language when applying for Canadian citizenship (minimum of CLB level 4 required).

===United Kingdom===
On 6 April 2015, UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) changed its English language requirements for UK visa and immigration applications.

IELTS assesses all four language skills and is accepted by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) at levels B1 to C2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

A new test, IELTS Life Skills, assesses Speaking and Listening at CEFR level A1 and at CEFR Level B1. IELTS Life Skills can be used to meet the English language requirements for some classes of visa application, including &#x27;family of a settled person&#x27; visas and indefinite leave and citizenship.

To be used for visa and immigration purposes, IELTS and IELTS Life Skills must be taken in test centres approved by the UKVI.

For UK visa purposes the test is designed to meet certain administrative requirements specified by UKVI. These Test Report Forms are slightly different, to show that the test taker has taken the test at an IELTS UKVI session. The actual test taken is the same – same content, examiners, format, level of difficulty, scoring and so on.

== Criticism ==
One criticism revolves around the accessibility and affordability of the IELTS test. The cost of taking the test, which varies by region but is generally considered expensive, can be a major barrier for test-takers from developing countries. For many, the test is prohibitively expensive, particularly if they need to retake it multiple times to achieve their desired score.

In addition to cost, accessibility issues arise from the limited availability of IELTS test centers. These centers are concentrated in urban areas, making it difficult for candidates in rural or remote locations to access testing facilities. This uneven distribution of test centers disproportionately affects individuals from less economically developed regions.

<text>Ruokolahti (; ; literally translated the &quot;Reed Bay&quot;) is a municipality of Finland, situated in south-eastern Finland, in the region of South Karelia. Neighbouring municipalities are Imatra, Lappeenranta, Taipalsaari, Puumala, Sulkava, Punkaharju, Parikkala and Rautjärvi. Ruokolahti covers an area of of which is water.

The municipality has inhabitants
(), but the population doubles in summer as holidaymakers occupy the 3,000 summer cottages in the region.

Ruokolahti is known for its natural environment, for example Kummakivi is a balancing rock located at 61° 29&#x27; 36.4596&quot; N, 28° 25&#x27; 45.5016&quot; E in Ruokolahti and is protected. In the west there is the Lake Saimaa and in the east there are hundreds of smaller lakes. The Salpausselkä ridges run through the area.

The famous sniper Simo Häyhä lived in Ruokolahti for 57 years after the 1939–40 Winter War. He is buried there in the graveyard of Ruokolahti Church.

The municipal coat of arms of Ruokolahti is a canting arms that directly refers to the name of the municipality, including reeds appearing in it. Wave line is usually used to describe a local body of water. The coat of arms was designed by Gustaf von Numers and was confirmed for use on September 11, 1951.

<doc id="347579" wikidata="Q719812" url="?curid=347579" title="Sheila Scott Macintyre">
<text>Sheila Scott Macintyre FRSE (23 April 1910 – 21 March 1960) was a Scottish mathematician best known for her work on the Whittaker constant. Macintyre is also known for co-authoring a German–English mathematics dictionary with Edith Witte.

==Education==

Sheila Scott was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 23 April 1910, the daughter of Helen Myers Meldrum and James Alexander Scott. The family lived at 24 Dudley Avenue close to Trinity Academy, where her father was a teacher.

She attended Trinity Academy, Edinburgh, during which time her father was appointed rector of the academy. Between 1926 and 1928 she attended Edinburgh Ladies&#x27; College (now The Mary Erskine School), where she graduated as dux in mathematics and joint dux of the college. She studied at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1932 with an MA in mathematics and natural philosophy. Afterwards, she continued her studies at Girton College, Cambridge, taking the Mathematical Tripos. In her final year at the university she worked on a research project under the supervision of Mary Cartwright. This resulted in her first published work &quot;On the Asymptotic Periods of Integral Functions&quot;. 
==Career==
Between 1934 and 1940 Scott taught mathematics at a number of schools. During this period Edmund Whittaker introduced Scott to fellow mathematician Archibald James Macintyre. The two married in 1940, and shortly after she was appointed as an assistant lecturer at the University of Aberdeen, where her husband was a lecturer. During this time she began working on her doctoral thesis. While pregnant with her second child, she stopped teaching but continued research. She received her PhD from Aberdeen in 1947 with the thesis &quot;Some Problems in Interpolatory Function Theory&quot; and under the supervision of Edward Maitland Wright.

Between 1947 and 1958 she published another 10 papers during a period where the couple had three children: Alister William Macintyre (born 1944), Douglas (born 1946 – died 1948 of enteritis) and Susan Elizabeth Macintyre Cantey (born 1950). Of her research during this time, Wright wrote &quot;... good as her research was there would have been more of it had she not had a family to look after.&quot; In 1956 she and Edith Witte published the book &quot;German-English Mathematical Vocabulary&quot;.

In 1958, the family emigrated to Cincinnati, United States, where Macintyre accepted a visiting professorship at the University of Cincinnati. Also in 1958, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Sheila Scott Macintyre died in 1960 in Cincinnati from breast cancer.

Mary Cartwright writes in her obituary &quot;She is remembered as an exceptionally clear lecturer, and an excellent teacher with a warm-hearted but realistic interest in each of her students and also as a charming and helpful and often amusing colleague.&quot;

<doc id="347585" wikidata="Q1861094" url="?curid=347585" title="Boxing (computer programming)">
<text>In computer science, boxing (a.k.a. wrapping) is the transformation of placing a primitive type within an object so that the value can be used as a reference. Unboxing is the reverse transformation of extracting the primitive value from its wrapper object. Autoboxing is the term for automatically applying boxing and/or unboxing transformations as needed.

==Boxing==

Boxing&#x27;s most prominent use is in Java where there is a distinction between reference and value types for reasons such as runtime efficiency and syntax and semantic issues. In Java, a can only store values of type . One might desire to have a of , but this is not directly possible. Instead Java defines primitive wrapper classes corresponding to each primitive type: and , and , and , etc. One can then define a using the boxed type and insert values into the list by boxing them as objects. (Using generic parameterized types introduced in J2SE 5.0, this type is represented as .)

On the other hand, C# has no primitive wrapper classes, but allows boxing of any value type, returning a generic reference. In Objective-C, any primitive value can be prefixed by a to make an out of it (e.g. or ). This allows for adding them in any of the standard collections, such as an .

Haskell has little or no notion of reference type, but still uses the term &quot;boxed&quot; for the runtime system&#x27;s uniform pointer-to-tagged union representation.

The boxed object is always a copy of the value object, and is usually immutable. Unboxing the object also returns a copy of the stored value. Repeated boxing and unboxing of objects can have a severe performance impact, because boxing dynamically allocates new objects and unboxing (if the boxed value is no longer used) then makes them eligible for garbage collection. However, modern garbage collectors such as the default Java HotSpot garbage collector can more efficiently collect short-lived objects, so if the boxed objects are short-lived, the performance impact may not be severe.

In some languages, there is a direct equivalence between an unboxed primitive type and a reference to an immutable, boxed object type. In fact, it is possible to substitute all the primitive types in a program with boxed object types. Whereas assignment from one primitive to another will copy its value, assignment from one reference to a boxed object to another will copy the reference value to refer to the same object as the first reference. However, this will not cause any problems, because the objects are immutable, so there is semantically no real difference between two references to the same object or to different objects (unless you look at physical equality). For all operations other than assignment, such as arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators, one can unbox the boxed type, perform the operation, and re-box the result as needed. Thus, it is possible to not store primitive types at all.

==Autoboxing==
Autoboxing is the term for getting a reference type out of a value type just through type conversion (either implicit or explicit). The compiler automatically supplies the extra source code that creates the object.

For example, in versions of Java prior to J2SE 5.0, the following code did not compile:
Integer i = new Integer(9);
Integer i = 9; // error in versions prior to 5.0!
Compilers prior to 5.0 would not accept the last line. are reference objects, on the surface no different from , , and so forth. To convert from an to an , one had to &quot;manually&quot; instantiate the Integer object. As of J2SE 5.0, the compiler will accept the last line, and automatically transform it so that an Integer object is created to store the value . This means that, from J2SE 5.0 on, something like , where and are themselves, will compile now - a and b are unboxed, the integer values summed up, and the result is autoboxed into a new , which is finally stored inside variable . The equality operators cannot be used this way, because the equality operators are already defined for reference types, for equality of the references; to test for equality of the value in a boxed type, one must still manually unbox them and compare the primitives, or use the method.

Another example: J2SE 5.0 allows the programmer to treat a collection (such as a ) as if it contained values instead of objects. This does not contradict what was said above: the collection still only contains references to dynamic objects, and it cannot list primitive types. It cannot be a , but it must be a instead. However, the compiler automatically transforms the code so that the list will &quot;silently&quot; receive objects, while the source code only mentions primitive values. For example, the programmer can now write and think as if the were added to the list; but, the compiler will have actually transformed the line into .

===Automatic unboxing===
With automatic unboxing the compiler automatically supplies the extra source code that retrieves the value out of that object, either by invoking some method on that object, or by other means.

For example, in versions of Java prior to J2SE 5.0, the following code did not compile:
Integer k = new Integer(4);
int l = k.intValue(); // always okay
int m = k; // would have been an error, but okay now
C# doesn&#x27;t support automatic unboxing in the same meaning as Java, because it doesn&#x27;t have a separate set of primitive types and object types. All types that have both primitive and object version in Java, are automatically implemented by the C# compiler as either primitive (value) types or object (reference) types.

In both languages, automatic boxing does not downcast automatically, i.e. the following code won&#x27;t compile:

C#:

int i = 42;
object o = i; // box
int j = o; // unbox (error)
Console.WriteLine(j); // unreachable line, author might have expected output &quot;42&quot;
Java:

int i = 42;
Object o = i; // box
int j = o; // unbox (error)
System.out.println(j); // unreachable line, author might have expected output &quot;42&quot;
== Boxing in Rust ==
Rust have the struct:

let number = Box::new(42);

If the value needs to passed to another thread it needs to use .

==Type helpers==
Modern Object Pascal has yet another way to perform operations on simple types, close to boxing, called type helpers in FreePascal or record helpers in Delphi and FreePascal in Delphi mode.&lt;br&gt;
The dialects mentioned are Object Pascal compile-to-native languages, and so miss some of the features that C# and Java can implement. Notably run-time type inference on strongly typed variables.&lt;br&gt;
But the feature is related to boxing.&lt;br&gt;
It allows the programmer to use constructs like

{$ifdef fpc}{$mode delphi}{$endif}
uses sysutils; // this unit contains wraps for the simple types
var
 x:integer=100;
 s:string;
begin
 s:= x.ToString;
 writeln(s);
end.

<doc id="347590" wikidata="Q3059230" url="?curid=347590" title="Eternal Champions">
<text>Eternal Champions is a 1993 fighting game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. It was one of the few fighting games of its time developed from the ground up as a home console title, rather than being released in arcades first and later ported to home systems.

Sega released &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; in hopes of capitalizing on the fighting game mania that the game industry was in the midst of following the massive success of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (1991) and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992). The game tried to set itself apart with unique features such as a heavier emphasis on its story, characters pulled from different time periods, reflectable projectiles, force fields, fighters that carried weapons, a training mode where players had to defend themselves against robotic traps, a novel method of executing moves, and elaborate stage-specific finishing moves called &quot;Overkills&quot;.

Two years later, an enhanced version, &quot;Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side&quot;, was released for the Sega CD. The game also spawned two spin-off games, &quot;Chicago Syndicate&quot; and &quot;X-Perts&quot;. &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; was added to the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console download service on December 3, 2007, and included with the Sega Genesis Mini microconsole released in 2019.

==Gameplay==
The game followed the typical eight-way directional pad/stick with six-button layout common to most fighting games at the time (more commonly in this case, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;). Since the standard Mega Drive/Genesis controller has only three action buttons, players would have to purchase a six-button controller or Sega Activator, or else use the start button to toggle the action buttons between punches and kicks. The joystick or D-pad is used to move away, towards, jump and crouch. There are three punches and three kicks that vary based upon speed and power. The weakest punches and kicks are fast but do minimal damage, medium attacks are a balanced mix of recovery speed and damage, and strong attacks are the most powerful but recover the slowest. Attacks can be blocked by pressing away (for high attacks) or down and away (for low attacks). Grapples are executed by standing close to an opponent and pressing toward or away and using either the medium or the strong punch button. These attacks cannot be blocked or escaped.

Each character has their own unique special attacks that are performed differently from those of other characters. If a character is hit several times in a row they become &quot;dizzy&quot; and their opponent can land a free attack. In &quot;Eternal Champions&quot;, all special move commands are performed by either pressing multiple buttons together, or holding back or down to charge and then pressing towards or up together with a button. There are no rolling motions in this game, and a given special move may only be performed with a specific button.

As seen in &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; released the previous year, &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; has a &quot;special attack meter&quot; that decreases each time a character performs a special move such as a projectile; different special attacks decrease the meter by different amounts and the characters each have a taunt move that decreases their opponent&#x27;s special attack meter as well. Characters can retreat into a defensive shell to recharge their meter. In tournament mode (the main single player mode), the computer opponent can do special moves even after its meter has reached zero.

The game introduces stage-specific finishing moves called Overkills. These are performed by defeating an opponent such that they fall upon a certain area of ground. If they land in the right spot, the life bars disappear and some element of the background kills them.

==Plot==
An omniscient being known as the Eternal Champion predicts that mankind will soon fade from existence due to the untimely and unjust deaths of key individuals throughout history who were destined for greatness. Seeking to restore balance to the world, the Eternal Champion gathers these souls from time moments before their deaths. The Eternal Champion only has enough power to restore life to one of these individuals, so he organizes and holds a fighting tournament between them, where the victor will be able to regain their life and change their fate while bringing balance to the universe, whilst the losers will be forced to die just as history recorded.

Unlike most fighting games, or video games in general, there are no characters in this game who are &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;. Each character has been chosen because he or she is either inherently good or has the potential to do great good and change the course of history for the better. Despite the ability to kill opponents in this game, it is not relevant to the story. Much like games such as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (which pioneered finishing moves in fighting games), the game&#x27;s &quot;Overkills&quot; have no impact on the story and are simply a gameplay element for the enjoyment of the player. It is actually revealed in a few character endings that some of the fighters become allies or friends during the course of the tournament.

===Fighters===
The game features nine playable characters. Beating arcade mode with any character reveals an epilogue detailing how the winner avoided their original death and then went on to make a positive change in their era.

*Blade – Jonathan Blade is a Syrian bounty hunter from 2030 A.D. He was hired by the government to help track down a terrorist that had stolen a lethal virus. Blade was about to apprehend the terrorist when special forces agents opened fire on both of them, accidentally causing the terrorist to drop the vial and release the virus.
*Jetta – Jetta Maxx is a member of Russian aristocracy from 1899 A.D. She was working undercover as a circus acrobat at the time of her death. A boxer revolutionary tampered with her tightrope equipment ahead of a major show in China. She fell to her death in front of the live crowd. When her true identity was revealed, it heightened tensions between both nations.
*Larcen – Larcen Tyler is a former cat-burglar from 1920s Chicago. He used to do jobs for a local crime boss. He was hired to plant evidence in the hospital room of a rival mafia leader. It was only when he got to the location that he discovered that his real target was the Chief of Police, and the &quot;evidence&quot; was actually a bomb. Larcen was killed in the explosion that destroyed most of the hospital.
*Midknight – Midknight is a vampire-like mutant hiding in Vietnam. In his former life, he was the noted British biochemist Mitchell Middleton Knight. He was hired by U.S. forces to spike water supplies during the Vietnam War in 1967. He became exposed to the chemical, and was mutated like every other victim. He was killed by a vampire hunter hired by the government before he could create a cure.
*R.A.X. – R.A.X. Coswell is an American cyber-kickboxer from 2345 A.D. His trainer programmed a virus into his R.A.X. exoskeleton software to ensure he lost an important match. Coswell died during the match as a result.
*Shadow – Shadow Yamato is a ninja assassin from modern-day (1993 A.D) Japan. She was thrown off the top of her employer’s skyscraper before she could publicly expose the murderous actions of her syndicate.
*Slash – Slash is a prehistoric hunter from 50,000 B.C. He was sentenced to death by the elders of his tribe who feared that Slash would use his high intelligence to usurp them.
*Trident – An artificial being created by the Atlanteans from 110 B.C. He was killed by a rival before he could compete in the final match of a gladiator tournament. As a consequence, the Roman Empire banished his race to the sea where they were eventually wiped out.
*Xavier – Xavier Pendragon was an alchemy student from 1692 A.D. He was executed under a false charge of witchcraft during the Salem Witch Trials.

The Eternal Champion appears as a non-playable boss character. He can only be played as using a Game Genie cheat code. He is also playable in the Tiger Handheld version, &quot;Eternal Champions: Special Moves Edition&quot;

All of the characters returned in &quot;Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Darkside&quot;.

==Development==
Though only credited within the game under &quot;special thanks&quot;, veteran comic book artist Ernie Chan created much of the character designs and art for the game.

==Release==
The cartridge was the second &quot;packaged game&quot; to be included with the Sega Activator, an elaborate infrared ring controller that players stood in and punched and kicked in order to make the characters perform different combat movements. It was one of only a few games that actually recognized the Activator and took advantage of most of the features of the unit. The player using the Activator was given an advantage of receiving 50% less and inflicting 50% more damage than the player using a regular controller.

===Promotion and other media===
A Slurpee flavor entitled &quot;Sega Eternal Champions Cherry&quot; was once available in 7-Eleven stores throughout the United States. It came in cups with pictures of the characters on them, and the bottom of the cup contained a temporary tattoo. There was also a special cash and rebate promotion in July 1993 that was featured on MTV. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; sponsored &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; tournaments in the United States as part of a roaming video game show. The game, however, was not yet completed so the participants were only given the choice of four characters to play as: Shadow, R.A.X, Larcen and Slash.

Two gamebooks, titled &quot;Eternal Champions Adventure Gamebook: The Cyber Warriors&quot; and &quot;Eternal Champions Adventure Gamebook 2: Citadel of Chaos&quot;, were released by Puffin Books. In the books, the reader controls the newest Champion and travels through time helping the game characters battle a megalomaniacal artificial intelligence called the Overlord, who is bent on replacing them with duplicates so that they cannot change the course of history for the better. Both books were released as sticker albums by Panini in 1993.

&quot;Eternal Champions&quot; was adapted by the UK Sega Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; in a stand-alone magazine &quot;Eternal Champions Special&quot;, which introduced the main characters and served as an adaptation to the game. The characters also appeared in two stories in the main &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; series, first in &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; (issues 19-24) and then &quot;Larson&#x27;s [sic] Revenge&quot; (issues 37–40) which dealt with the professional thief Larcen Tyler returning to 1920s Chicago and working with the female ninja Shadow Yamoto to take down the crime boss who killed him. &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; was the only non-Sonic-related Sega property to receive a special issue of &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot;.

===&quot;Eternal Champions: Special Moves Edition&quot;===
Eternal Champions: Special Moves Edition is a handheld game by Tiger and is a part of the Sega Tiger Electronic Pocket Arcade game series. The game is essentially a smaller and simpler version of &quot;Eternal Champions&quot;. It includes all nine characters and the Eternal Champion as a playable character. This version has three different types of gameplay, one-on-one, one against three, and team battle.

==Reception==
In the United Kingdom, it was the top-selling Mega Drive game in February 1994. It sold over 1.6 million copies.

Upon the game&#x27;s release, &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; was given a polarizing mixed reception, and held an average aggregate score of 62.5% at GameRankings at the time of the site&#x27;s 2019 closure. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; gave it a score of 97%, calling it &quot;at least as good&quot; as &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, and &quot;Electronic Games&quot; gave it a 91%. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; were divided, with two of them recommending the game based on the large number of options and the selection of moves, while the other two described it as a major disappointment, citing mediocre graphics and unexciting characters. They gave the game a 6.25 out of 10 average, with individual reviewer scores ranging from 5 to 8.

In 2008, IGN gave the Virtual Console release a score of 6 out of 10, criticizing its difficult to learn play mechanics while praising the game&#x27;s story, training mode, and &quot;inner strength meter&quot;. IGN concluded &quot;it&#x27;s not likely that many players who&#x27;ve never previously heard of the game will have the patience to spend that much time getting to know it.&quot;

In 1995, &quot;Mega Zone&quot; included the game on their Top 50 Games In History summarizing: &quot;Huge characters and heaps of playability put it up their with &quot;MKII&quot; and &quot;SFII&quot;.&quot; In 2006, IGN ranked the game&#x27;s finishing moves (&quot;Overkills&quot;) as the best gore effects in video game history. In 2011, &quot;Complex&quot; included it on the list of ten &quot;most blatant &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; ripoffs&quot; but added that it was &quot;one of the more successful faux-&quot;MK&quot; fighters&quot; and &quot;the only thing that sucked was the difficulty.&quot; &quot;Complex&quot; also featured it on the 2012 list of the 25 Sega franchises they would like to see revisited and ranked it as the 24th best 2D fighting game of all time in 2013.

==Legacy==
Though &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; saw strong sales and was at one point a popular enough property to warrant a sequel, a remake, two spin-offs, and various multimedia tie-ins, after the planned third game in the core fighting series was cancelled Sega has not produced any new product for the franchise. The entire series had been absent from the compilations of Sega Genesis games that have been released on various platforms over the years, until the first entry saw a release through Steam on September 13, 2010. Rap group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot; was loosely inspired by the video game, not just in title, but even as far as the use of samples, such as the character bios theme for &quot;Eternal&quot;, and the bad ending theme being the basis of the original &quot;Crossroad&quot;, which would later be remixed, becoming the group&#x27;s biggest single and earning them a Grammy. 

===Sequels===

&quot;Eternal Champions: Challenge From the Dark Side&quot; kept the special attack meter but made most special attacks use less of the meter than in the previous game. Therefore, the characters gained a multitude of special attacks that did not deplete the special attack meter. Three new types of finishing moves were added in &quot;Challenge from the Dark Side&quot;: the second Overkill in each stage called Sudden Death (that could be activated when the victim still had a little life left), Vendetta, and Cinekill. Combo attacks were also introduced, jumping attacks could be linked to ground attacks and most normal attacks could be linked to other normal attacks. In addition, the game was significantly more violent and bloody than its predecessor, especially in the new finishing moves. According to an interview with Michael Latham there were also plans for a Game Gear version of the original game, but this never materialized.

A third game, &quot;Eternal Champions: The Final Chapter&quot;, was advertised for the Sega Saturn, but the game was cancelled shortly after beginning development in order to push the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series in the United States. According to an interview with Michael Latham, this decision was made by Sega of Japan: &quot;Sega of Japan felt that &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; was keeping &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; from being more successful in the US and that it would be better if the company focused on only one franchise... and as Sega is a Japanese company, the Japan side won. It was a crushing blow and was the only time in working nearly a decade at Sega I considered quitting. I mainly stayed with the hope to change that decision, but sadly never could. Even when we did the NetFighter project for Heat.net, we weren&#x27;t able to use the &quot;Eternal&quot; characters as a hidden bonus. From Japan&#x27;s view, the game never existed, in spite of its stellar sales and even offers to do comic books and a cartoon around it.&quot;

===Spin-offs===
There are two video games which are spin-offs of the main &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; series, and are considered as being part of alternate universes to the main story of the core games, starring several popular &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; characters. The first game is &quot;Chicago Syndicate&quot;, an action game released for the Sega Game Gear portable platform in 1995. The plot is based in an alternate reality where Larcen Tyler did not die in 1920 as stated in &quot;Eternal Champions&quot;, and now seeks revenge on the Chicago Mafia. The second game, &quot;X-Perts&quot;, is a side-scrolling beat&#x27;em up released in 1996 for the Genesis. Like &quot;Chicago Syndicate&quot;, its plot is based in an alternate reality, this time one where Shadow Yamoto did not die in 1993 and instead formed a vigilante group. Additionally, there were also two gamebooks called: The Cyber Warriors &amp; Citadel of Chaos, released in 1994.

===Film adaptation===
On August 16, 2024, a film adaptation based on the game was announced with Sega partnering with Skydance Media and set to be written by Derek Connolly.

<doc id="347594" wikidata="Q815549" url="?curid=347594" title="Belgian French">
<text>Belgian French () is the variety of French spoken mainly among the French Community of Belgium, alongside related Oïl languages of the region such as Walloon, Picard, Champenois, and Lorrain (Gaumais). The French language spoken in Belgium differs very little from that of France or Switzerland. It is characterized by the use of some terms that are considered archaic in France, as well as loanwords from languages such as Walloon, Picard, and Belgian Dutch. 

French is one of the three official languages of Belgium, along with Dutch and German. It is spoken natively by around 40% of the population, primarily in the regions of Wallonia and Brussels. The French spoken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi is largely based on Belgian French, as all three countries are former colonies of Belgium.

==Influences==
While a number of Oïl languages have traditionally been spoken in different areas of Wallonia, French emerged as the regional language of literature in the 13th century. This was a result of heavy French cultural influence on the region over the past few centuries. The diversity of local languages influenced French in Wallonia, with words from Walloon, Picard, Champenois and Lorrain making their way into the local variant. Until the 20th century, Walloon was the majority language of Wallonia, and most speakers were bilingual in French and Walloon.

While the French spoken in Wallonia was influenced by local languages, the variant spoken in Brussels was influenced by Dutch, specifically the local Brabantian dialect. The population of the city, situated in the region of Flanders, originally was largely Dutch-speaking, aside from a French-speaking aristocracy. A gradual Francisation of the population began in the 19th century and continued throughout the 20th century, as French emerged as the dominant language of the city. The local dialect of Brussels includes some loanwords from Dutch, as well as expressions that have been translated into French.

==Phonology==
There are a few consistent phonological differences between the French in France and Belgium but usually no more than the differences between regional dialects within France (or the ones that exist between the English of Toronto and Vancouver (Canada) for instance), which might even be nonexistent. Regional accents however, can vary from city to city (the Liège accent being an example). However, on the whole, accents may vary more according to one&#x27;s social class and education.

While stronger accents have been more typical of the working class, they have become much less pronounced since World War I and the widespread use of television, which has helped to standardise accents and the types of words used by speakers. Belgian speakers are taught the pronunciation of standard Belgian French in schools. The following differences vary by speaker, according to level of education, age and native region:
* The lack of . The combination is replaced by , and in other cases, becomes a full vowel . Thus, &quot;enfuir&quot; (to run away) and &quot;enfouir&quot; (to bury) are pronounced the same, unlike in France and Quebec.
* The nasal vowels are pronounced like in France: → , → , → , but the distinction between the nasal vowels and has been retained in Belgium, but in many regions of France such as Paris, the two have merged. For example, in Belgium, &quot;brin&quot; (stalk) and &quot;brun&quot; (brown) are still pronounced differently, like in Quebec but unlike in Paris.
* The distinction between the vowels and has been maintained in final open syllables. For example, &quot;peau&quot; (skin) and &quot;pot&quot; (jar) are still pronounced differently, unlike in France and Quebec.
* There are more distinctions between long and short vowels than Quebec French; all the circumflexes are pronounced:
** The distinction between the vowels and is still present in Belgium, but they have merged in France: &quot;mettre&quot; (put) and &quot;maître&quot; (master) . Otherwise, many words are pronounced with a long even if there is no circumflex: &quot;peine&quot; and &quot;reine&quot; , etc.
** The phonemes and are still distinct in Belgium, unlike in France and Quebec: &quot;il&quot; vs. &quot;île&quot; .
** The phonemes and are still distinct in Belgium, unlike in France and Quebec: &quot;chute&quot; vs. &quot;flûte&quot; .
** The phonemes and are still distinct in Belgium, unlike in France and Quebec: &quot;toute&quot; vs. &quot;croûte&quot; .
** The phonemes and are still distinct, unlike in Southern France: &quot;cote&quot; vs. &quot;côte&quot; 
** The phonemes and are still distinct, unlike in Southern France: &quot;jeune&quot; vs. &quot;jeûne&quot; .
** Long vowels are also used in open syllables in Belgium, even at the end of a word: , , , , and . As a result, almost all feminine adjectives are still phonetically distinct from their masculine counterparts in Belgium, unlike in France and Quebec.
** The vowels and are still distinct in Belgium, but the marginal phoneme is usually pronounced as a lengthened version of : &quot;pâte&quot; (paste) .
* The letter &quot;w&quot; is almost always pronounced as , like in English, which also approximates the Flemish &quot;w&quot;. In France and Quebec, in many words, &quot;w&quot; is pronounced , as in German. For example, the word &quot;wagon&quot; (train car) is pronounced in France and Quebec, but in Belgium.
* Some speakers devoice final stops, in which case &quot;d&quot; is pronounced like &quot;t&quot;, &quot;b&quot; is pronounced like &quot;p&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is pronounced like &quot;k&quot;. In combination with the dropping of consonants () in final consonant clusters, this leads to pronunciations such as &quot;grande&quot; instead of , &quot;table&quot; instead of , and &quot;tigre&quot; instead of .
* For some speakers, the short high vowels are realised as lax in closed syllables: .

Certain accents, such as in certain cities (notably Brussels and Liège) and those of speakers who are older and particularly less educated, are farther from the pronunciation of France. For example, in the dialect in and around Liège, especially for older speakers, the letter &quot;h&quot; is pronounced in certain positions. It is always silent, however, in Standard French. That dialect is known also for its slow, slightly &quot;singing&quot; intonation, a trait that is even stronger towards the east, in the Verviers area.

==Vocabulary==
Words unique to Belgian French are called &quot;Belgicisms&quot; (French: ). (This term is also used to refer to Dutch words used in Belgium but not in the Netherlands.) In general, the Francophone and educated speakers understand the meaning and use of words in Standard French, and they may also use Standard French if they speak with non-Belgians who speak in Standard French, as their accent hints. Overall, the lexical differences between Standard French and Belgian French are minor. They could be compared to the differences that might exist between two speakers of American English living in different parts of the United States or those between a Canadian English speaker and a British English speaker.

Furthermore, the same speakers would often be well aware of the differences and might even be able to &quot;standardise&quot; their language or use each other&#x27;s words to avoid confusion. Even so, there are too many forms to try to form any complete list in this article. However, some of the better-known usages include the following:
*The use of for &quot;seventy&quot; and for &quot;ninety&quot;, in contrast to Standard French (literally &quot;sixty-ten&quot;) and (&quot;four-twenty-ten&quot;). Those former words occur also in Swiss French. Unlike the Swiss, however, Belgians never use for (&quot;four twenties&quot;), with the use of in the local Brussels dialect as being the only exception. Although they are considered Belgian and Swiss words, and were common in France until around the 16th century, when the newer forms began to dominate.
*The words for meals vary, as described in the table below. The usage in Belgian, Swiss and Canadian French accords with the etymology: &quot;déjeuner&quot; comes from a verb meaning &quot;to break the fast&quot;. In France, however, breakfast is rendered by &quot;petit déjeuner&quot;. &quot;Souper&quot; is used in France to refer instead to a meal taken around midnight. 
*Many Walloon words and expressions have crept into Belgian French, especially in the eastern regions of Wallonia:
**&quot;Qu&#x27;à torate&quot; (similar to &quot;à bientôt&quot;, &quot;see you soon&quot;)
**&quot;pèkèt&quot; (&quot;jenever&quot;)
**&quot;barakî&quot; (similar to the word &quot;chav&quot; in British English).
**&quot;Qué novel ?&quot; (similar to &quot;quoi de neuf ?, &quot;what&#x27;s up ?&quot;)&quot;
*Germanic influences are also visible:
**&quot;Crolle&quot; (&quot;curl&quot;) reflects the Brabantic pronunciation of the Dutch word &quot;krul&quot;. (&quot;Boucle&quot; is used in France.)
**&quot;S&#x27;il vous plaît&quot; is used to mean &quot;here&quot; (when someone is handed something) as well as &quot;please&quot;, but in France, the meaning is limited to &quot;please&quot;, &quot;voilà&quot; is used for &quot;here&quot;. That is comparable to the use of &quot;alstublieft&quot; in Dutch.
**&quot;Dringuelle&quot; (Standard French &quot;pourboire&quot;), &quot;tip&quot;, from the Dutch word &quot;drinkgeld&quot;, but it is less commonly used in Brussels.
**&quot;Kot&quot; (student room in a dormitory) from Belgian Dutch &quot;kot&quot;.
**&quot;Ring&quot; (ring road) from Dutch &quot;ring&quot;. In Standard French, the term is &quot;ceinture périphérique&quot; or &quot;périph&#x27;&quot;.
**&quot;Savoir&quot; (to know) is often used in the place of &quot;pouvoir&quot; (to be able [to]). It was quite common, however, in older forms of French.
**&quot;Blinquer&quot; (to shine), instead of &quot;briller&quot;, has a Germanic origin and passed through Walloon.
**&quot;Bourgmestre&quot; (mayor), instead of &quot;maire&quot;.

==Grammar==
The grammar of Belgian French is usually the same as that of France, but Germanic influences can be seen in the following differences:
*&quot;Ça me goûte&quot;, Standard French &quot;ça me plaît&quot;, &quot;I like it&quot; (only for food), is a calque of Dutch &quot;Dat smaakt&quot;: Spanish &#x27;me gusta&#x27;.
*&quot;Tu viens avec ?&quot;, Standard French &quot;Tu m&#x27;accompagnes?&quot;, literally &quot;Are you coming with?&quot; (meaning &quot;Are you coming with me?&quot;), is a calque of Dutch &quot;Kom je mee?&quot;.
*&quot;Ça tire ici&quot; (used mostly in Brussels), for Standard French &quot;Il y a un courant d&#x27;air&quot;) &quot;There is a draught&quot; is a calque of the Belgian Dutch &quot;Het trekt hier&quot; (Netherlands Dutch &quot;Het tocht hier&quot;).
*Phrases like &quot;pour + V&quot; : &quot;Passe-moi un bic pour écrire&quot; (Standard French &quot;Donne-moi un stylo afin que je puisse écrire&quot;) &quot;Give me a pen, so that I can write / for me to write&quot; is a grammatical structure found in Dutch (&quot;om te +V&quot;).
*&quot;&quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce que c&#x27;est que ça pour&quot; un animal ?&quot; Standard French &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce que c&#x27;est comme animal ?&quot; / &quot;Quelle sorte d&#x27;animal c&#x27;est ?&quot;, &quot;What kind of animal is this?&quot; (literally, &quot;What is that for an animal?&quot;), Dutch &quot;Wat is dat voor (een) dier?&quot; or &quot;Wat voor dier is dat?&quot;
*The use of &quot;une fois&quot; (&quot;once&quot;) in mid-sentence, especially in Brussels, is a direct translation of Dutch &quot;eens&quot;. French people who want to imitate the Belgian accent often use a lot of &quot;une fois&quot; at the end of the sentences, often wrongly: &quot;Viens une fois ici, literally from the Dutch &quot;Kom eens hier&quot; (&quot;Come once here&quot;). The English equivalent would be &quot;Could you come here?&quot; or &quot;Why don&#x27;t you come here?&quot;
*&quot;Jouer poker&quot; (&quot;Standard French &quot;Jouer au poker&quot;) &quot;Playing poker&quot; is influenced by the Dutch &quot;Poker spelen&quot;.

<doc id="347595" wikidata="Q465217" url="?curid=347595" title="Makiko Tanaka">
<text>is a Japanese politician. She is the daughter of former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and his official wife Hana.

==Early life==
Tanaka attended high school at Germantown Friends School in the United States and graduated from Waseda University. She spent most of her early adulthood working with her father&#x27;s political machine Etsuzankai, and was first lady to her father since her mother, Hana, was absent due to long-standing illness. She was elected to the Lower House in 1993, shortly after her father&#x27;s death.

==Career==
Tanaka was the first female foreign minister of Japan, from April 2001 to January 2002, but was fired from the cabinet after making remarks critical of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Koizumi had also made indirect negative remarks toward Tanaka shortly before her removal as Foreign Minister. Later that year, she was expelled from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and barred from party membership for two years.

In August 2002, Tanaka resigned from the Diet after allegations that she had embezzled her secretaries&#x27; civil service salaries. A Tokyo court cleared her in September, and she ran for the Diet again as an independent in November 2003.

Her husband Naoki Suzuki, whom she married in 1969 was adopted as an adult into her family, because she has no brothers to carry on the family name.

In August 2009, Tanaka and her husband joined the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. In September 2009 she became the Diet chairperson of the Committee on Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. In September 2011 she became the Diet chairperson of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. On October 1, 2012, she became Minister of Education, Culture, Science, Sports, and Technology, as part of a reshuffle of the Yoshihiko Noda Cabinet.

On November 2, 2012 she denied applications for three new universities, contradicting a report the previous day that had endorsed the establishment of the universities. It had been 30 years since a minister had contradicted the ministry in such a way. This sparked a large amount of criticism and after pressure from within the DPJ she reversed her decision and approved the applications.

She lost her seat in the December 16, 2012 general election. She left office on 26 December 2012.

<text>Carpenter bees are species in the genus Xylocopa of the subfamily Xylocopinae. The genus includes some 500 bees in 31 subgenera. The common name &quot;carpenter bee&quot; derives from their nesting behavior; nearly all species burrow into hard plant material such as dead wood or bamboo. The main exceptions are species in the subgenus &quot;Proxylocopa&quot;, which dig nesting tunnels in suitable soil.

== Characteristics ==

Many species in this enormous genus are difficult to tell apart; most species are all black, or primarily black with some yellow or white pubescence. Some differ only in subtle morphological features, such as details of the male genitalia. Males of some species differ confusingly from the females, being covered in greenish-yellow fur. The confusion of species arises particularly in the common names; in India, for example, the common name for any all-black species of &quot;Xylocopa&quot; is &quot;bhanvra&quot; (or &quot;bhomora&quot; - ভোমোৰা - in Assamese), and reports and sightings of &quot;bhanvra&quot; or &quot;bhomora&quot; are commonly misattributed to a European species, &quot;Xylocopa violacea&quot;; however, this species is found only in the northern regions of Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab, and most reports of &quot;bhanvra&quot;, especially elsewhere in India, refer to any of roughly 15 other common black &quot;Xylocopa&quot; species in the region, such as &quot;X. nasalis&quot;, &quot;X. tenuiscapa&quot;, or &quot;X. tranquebarorum&quot;.
Non-professionals commonly confuse carpenter bees with bumblebees; the simplest rule of thumb for telling them apart is that most carpenter bees have a shiny abdomen, whereas bumblebee abdomens are completely covered with dense hair. Males of some species of carpenter bees have a white or yellow face, unlike bumblebees, while females lack the bare corbicula of bumblebees; the hind leg is entirely hairy.

The wing venation is characteristic; the marginal cell in the front wing is narrow and elongated, and its apex bends away from the costa. The front wing has small stigma. When closed, the bee&#x27;s short mandibles conceal the labrum. The clypeus is flat. Males of many species have much larger eyes than the females, which relates to their mating behavior.

In the United States, two eastern species, &quot;Xylocopa virginica&quot; and &quot;X. micans&quot;, occur. Three more species are primarily western in distribution, &quot;X. sonorina&quot;, &quot;X. tabaniformis orpifex&quot;, and &quot;X. californica&quot;. &quot;X. virginica&quot; is by far the more widely distributed species.
== Ecological significance ==
In several species, the females live alongside their own daughters or sisters, creating a small social group. They use wood bits to form partitions between the cells in the nest. A few species bore holes in wood dwellings. Since the tunnels are near the surface, structural damage is generally minor or superficial. However, carpenter bee nests are attractive to woodpeckers, which may do further damage by drilling into the wood to feed on the bees or larvae.

Carpenter bees have short mouthparts and are important pollinators on some open-faced or shallow flowers; for some they even are obligate pollinators, for example the maypop (&quot;Passiflora incarnata&quot;) and &quot;Orphium&quot;, which are not pollinated by any other insects. They also are important pollinators of flowers with various forms of lids, such as &quot;Salvia&quot; species and some members of the Fabaceae. However many carpenter bees &quot;rob&quot; nectar by slitting the sides of flowers with deep corollae. &quot;Xylocopa virginica&quot; is one example of a species with such nectar robbing behavior. With their short labia the bees cannot reach the nectar without piercing the long-tubed flowers; they miss contact with the anthers and perform no pollination. In some plants, this reduces fruit and seed production, while others have developed defence mechanisms against nectar robbing. When foraging for pollen from some species with tubular flowers however, the same species of carpenter bees still achieve pollination, if the anthers and stigmata are exposed together.
 
Many Old World carpenter bees have a special pouch-like structure on the inside of their first metasomal tergite called the acarinarium where certain mites (&quot;Dinogamasus&quot; species) reside as commensals. The exact nature of the relationship is not fully understood, though in other bees that carry mites, they are beneficial, feeding either on fungi in the nest, or on other harmful mites.

== Behavior ==

As a subfamily, they nest in a wide range of host plants, but any one species may show definite adaptations or preferences for particular groups of plants. Carpenter bees are traditionally considered solitary bees, though some species have simple social nests in which mothers and daughters may cohabit. Examples of this type of social nesting can be seen in the species &quot;Xylocopa sulcatipes&quot; and &quot;Xylocopa nasalis&quot;. When females cohabit, a division of labor between them occurs sometimes. In this type of nesting, multiple females either share in the foraging and nest laying, or one female does all the foraging and nest laying, while the other females guard.

Solitary species differ from social species. Solitary bees tend to be gregarious and often several nests of solitary bees are near each other. In solitary nesting, the founding bee forages, builds cells, lays the eggs, and guards. Normally, only one generation of bees live in the nest. &quot;Xylocopa pubescens&quot; is one carpenter bee species that can have both social and solitary nests.

Carpenter bees make nests by tunneling into wood, bamboo, and similar hard plant material such as peduncles, usually dead. They vibrate their bodies as they rasp their mandibles against hard wood, each nest having a single entrance which may have many adjacent tunnels. The entrance is often a perfectly circular hole measuring about on the underside of a beam, bench, or tree limb. Carpenter bees do not eat wood. They discard the bits of wood, or reuse particles to build partitions between cells. The tunnel functions as a nursery for brood and storage for the pollen/nectar upon which the brood subsists. The provision masses of some species are among the most complex in shape of any group of bees; whereas most bees fill their brood cells with a soupy mass and others form simple spheroidal pollen masses, &quot;Xylocopa&quot; species form elongated and carefully sculpted masses that have several projections which keep the bulk of the mass from coming into contact with the cell walls, sometimes resembling an irregular caltrop. The eggs are very large relative to the size of the female, and are some of the largest eggs among all insects. Carpenter bees can be timber pests, and cause substantial damage to wood if infestations go undetected for several years.

Two very different mating systems appear to be common in carpenter bees, and often this can be determined simply by examining specimens of the males of any given species. Species in which the males have large eyes are characterized by a mating system where the males either search for females by patrolling, or by hovering and waiting for passing females, which they then pursue. In the other mating system, the males often have very small heads, but a large, hypertrophied glandular reservoir in the mesosoma releases pheromones into the airstream behind the male while it flies or hovers. The pheromone advertises the presence of the male to females.

Male bees often are seen hovering near nests and will approach nearby animals. However, males are harmless, since they do not have a stinger. Female carpenter bees are capable of stinging, but they are docile and rarely sting unless caught in the hand or otherwise directly provoked.

== Natural predators ==
Woodpeckers eat carpenter bees, as do various species of birds, such as shrikes and bee-eaters as well as some mammals such as ratels. Other predators include large mantises and predatory flies, particularly large robber-flies of the family Asilidae. Woodpeckers are attracted to the noise of the bee larvae and drill holes along the tunnels to feed on them.

Apart from outright predators, parasitoidal species of bee flies (e.g. &quot;Xenox&quot;) lay eggs in the entrance to the bee&#x27;s nest and the fly maggots live off the bee larvae.

<text>Codex Usserianus Primus (Dublin, Trinity College Library, 55) is an early 7th-century Old Latin Gospel Book. It is dated palaeographically to the 6th or 7th century. It is designated by r (traditional system).

==Description==
The manuscript is damaged, with the leaves being fragmentary and discoloured. The remains of the approximately 180 vellum folios have been remounted on paper. It contains the text of the Pericope Adulterae as do many Old Latin manuscripts of the Italian branch. It contains some lacunae (Matthew 1:1–15:16; 15:31–16:13; 21:4–21; 28:16–20; John 1:1–15; Mark 14:58–15:8; 15:29–16:20). It names the two thieves crucified with Jesus as, Ioathas and Capnatas (Luke 23:32).

The order of Gospels is Western: Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark. It represents European Old Latin recension.

The manuscript has a single remaining decoration, a cross outlined in black dots at the end of the Luke (fol. 149v). The cross is between the Greek letters alpha and omega. It is also flanked by the &quot;explicit&quot; (an ending phrase) for Luke and the &quot;incipit&quot; (first few words) for Mark. The entire assemblage is contained within a triple square frame of dots and small &quot;s&quot; marks with crescent shaped corner motifs. The cross has been compared to similar crosses found in the Bologna Lactantius, the Paris St. John, and the Valerianus Gospels. Initials on folios 94, 101 and 107 have been set off by small red dots. This represents the first appearance of decoration by &quot;dotting&quot; around text, a motif which would be important in later Insular manuscripts.

There are some paleographic similarities with early manuscripts produced at the monastery at Bobbio, such as the Ambrosiana Jerome and the Ambrosiana Orosius. However, it is now thought to have been produced in Ireland. It may therefore be the earliest surviving Irish codex.

The manuscript&#x27;s traditional name can be translated as &quot;the First Book of Uss(h)er&quot; and refers to James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh. Despite the name, it is doubtful that Ussher ever actually owned the manuscript.

The text of the codex was collated in 1884 by T. K. Abbott who also gave the manuscript its name.

Currently it is housed at Trinity College (55) at Dublin and can be read online using the Digital Collections portal of the Trinity College library.
