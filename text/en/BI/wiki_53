<text>The world&#x27;s principal religions and spiritual traditions may be classified into a small number of major groups, though this is not a uniform practice. This theory began in the 18th century with the goal of recognizing the relative degrees of civility in different societies, but this concept of a ranking order has since fallen into disrepute in many contemporary cultures.

==Religious demographics==

One way to define a major religion is by the number of current adherents. The population numbers by religion are computed by a combination of census reports and population surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example the United States or France), but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count.

There is no consensus among researchers as to the best methodology for determining the religiosity profile of the world&#x27;s population. A number of fundamental aspects are unresolved:

* Whether to count &quot;historically predominant religious culture[s]&quot;
* Whether to count only those who actively &quot;practice&quot; a particular religion
* Whether to count based on a concept of &quot;self-identification as adherents&quot;
* Whether to count only those who expressly self-identify with a particular denomination
* Whether to count only adults, or to include children as well
* Whether to rely on official government-provided statistics
* Whether to use multiple sources and ranges or single &quot;best source(s)&quot;

==Classification==
Religious traditions fall into super-groups in comparative religion, arranged by historical origin and mutual influence. Abrahamic religions originate in the Middle East, Indian religions in the Indian subcontinent (South Asia) and East Asian religions in East Asia. Another group with supra-regional influence are Afro-American religion, which have their origins in Central and West Africa.

* Middle Eastern religions:
** Abrahamic religions are the largest group, and these consist mainly of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and the Baháʼí Faith. They are named for the Hebrew patriarch Abraham, and are unified by the practice of monotheism. Today, at least 3.8 billion people are followers of Abrahamic religions and are spread widely around the world apart from the regions around East and Southeast Asia. Several Abrahamic organizations are vigorous proselytizers. Abrahamic religions with fewer adherents include the Baháʼí Faith, the Druze faith, Samaritanism, and Rastafari. 
** Iranian religions, partly of Indo-European origins, include Zoroastrianism, Yazdânism, Uatsdin, Yarsanism, Manichaeism, and Yazidism.
** Gnosticism, including historical traditions of Mandaeism, which is still alive in the Middle East and diaspora.
* Eastern religions:
** Indian religions, originated in Greater India and they tend to share a number of key concepts, such as dharma, karma, reincarnation among others. They are of the most influence across the Indian subcontinent, East Asia, Southeast Asia, as well as isolated parts of Russia. The main Indian religions are Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. 
** East Asian religions consist of several East Asian religions which make use of the concept of &quot;Tao&quot; (in Chinese), &quot;Đạo&quot; (in Vietnamese) or &quot;Dō&quot; (in Japanese or Korean). They include many Chinese folk religions, Taoism and Confucianism, as well as Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese religions, which are influenced by Chinese religious thought.
* Indigenous ethnic religions, found on every continent, now marginalized by the major organized faiths in many parts of the world or persisting as undercurrents (folk religions) of major religions. Includes traditional African religions, Asian shamanism, Native American religions, Austronesian and Australian Aboriginal traditions, Chinese folk religions, and postwar Shinto. Under more traditional listings, this has been referred to as &quot;paganism&quot; along with historical polytheism.
** African religions:
*** The religions of the tribal peoples of Sub-Saharan Africa, but excluding ancient Egyptian religion, which is considered to belong to the ancient Middle East; 
*** African diasporic religions practiced in the Americas, imported as a result of the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 18th centuries, building on traditional religions of Central and West Africa.
* New religious movement is the term applied to any religious faith which has emerged since the 19th century, often syncretizing, re-interpreting or reviving aspects of older traditions such as Ayyavazhi, Mormonism, Ahmadiyya, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, polytheistic reconstructionism, and so forth.

==History of religious categories==


===Christian categorizations===
Initially, Christians had a simple dichotomy of world beliefs: Christian civility versus foreign heresy or barbarity. In the 18th century, &quot;heresy&quot; was clarified to mean Judaism and Islam; along with paganism, this created a fourfold classification which spawned such works as John Toland&#x27;s &quot;Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile, and Mahometan Christianity&quot;, which represented the three Abrahamic religions as different &quot;nations&quot; or sects within &quot;religion&quot; itself, the &quot;true monotheism.&quot;

Daniel Defoe described the original definition as follows: &quot;Religion is properly the Worship given to God, but &#x27;tis also applied to the Worship of Idols and false Deities.&quot; At the turn of the 19th century, in between 1780 and 1810, the language dramatically changed: instead of &quot;religion&quot; being synonymous with spirituality, authors began using the plural, &quot;religions&quot;, to refer to both Christianity and other forms of worship. Therefore, Hannah Adams&#x27;s early encyclopedia, for example, had its name changed from &quot;An Alphabetical Compendium of the Various Sects...&quot; to &quot;A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations&quot;.

In 1838, the four-way division of Christianity, Judaism, Mahommedanism (archaic terminology for Islam) and paganism was multiplied considerably by Josiah Conder&#x27;s &quot;Analytical and Comparative View of All Religions Now Extant among Mankind&quot;. Conder&#x27;s work still adhered to the four-way classification, but in his eye for detail he puts together much historical work to create something resembling the modern Western image: he includes Druze, Yazidis, Mandaeans, and Elamites under a list of possibly monotheistic groups, and under the final category, of &quot;polytheism and pantheism&quot;, he listed Zoroastrianism, &quot;Vedas, Puranas, Tantras, Reformed sects&quot; of India as well as &quot;Brahminical idolatry&quot;, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Lamaism, &quot;religion of China and Japan&quot;, and &quot;illiterate superstitions&quot; as others.

The modern meaning of the phrase &quot;world religion&quot;, putting non-Christians at the same level as Christians, began with the 1893 Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions in Chicago. The Parliament spurred the creation of a dozen privately funded lectures with the intent of informing people of the diversity of religious experience: these lectures funded researchers such as William James, D. T. Suzuki, and Alan Watts, who greatly influenced the public conception of world religions.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the category of &quot;world religion&quot; fell into serious question, especially for drawing parallels between vastly different cultures, and thereby creating an arbitrary separation between the religious and the secular.

===Islam categorizations===
In Islam, the Quran mentions three categories: Muslims, the People of the Book, and idol worshipers.

<doc id="348454" wikidata="Q333661" url="?curid=348454" title="Cahokia">
<text>Cahokia Mounds (11 MS 2) is the site of a Native American city (which existed 1050–1350 CE) directly across the Mississippi River from present-day St. Louis. The state archaeology park lies in south-western Illinois between East St. Louis and Collinsville. The park covers , or about , and contains about 80 manmade mounds, but the ancient city was much larger. At its apex around 1100 CE, the city covered about , included about 120 earthworks in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and functions, and had a population of between 15,000 and 20,000 people.

Cahokia was the largest and most influential urban settlement of the Mississippian culture, which developed advanced societies across much of what is now the Central and the Southeastern United States, beginning around 1000 CE. Today, the Cahokia Mounds are considered to be the largest and most complex archaeological site north of the great pre-Columbian cities in Mexico.

The city&#x27;s original name is unknown. The mounds were later named after the Cahokia tribe, a historic Illiniwek people living in the area when the first French explorers arrived in the 17th century. As this was centuries after Cahokia was abandoned by its original inhabitants, the Cahokia tribe was not necessarily descended from the earlier Mississippian-era people. Most likely, multiple indigenous ethnic groups settled in the Cahokia Mounds area during the time of the city&#x27;s apex.

Cahokia Mounds is a National Historic Landmark and a designated site for state protection. It is also one of the 26 UNESCO World Heritage Sites within the United States. The largest pre-Columbian earthen construction in the Americas north of Mexico, the site is open to the public and administered by the Illinois Historic Preservation Division and supported by the Cahokia Mounds Museum Society. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois state bicentennial, the Cahokia Mounds were selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois). It was recognized by &quot;USA Today Travel&quot; magazine, as one of the selections for &#x27;Illinois 25 Must See Places&#x27;.

==History==
=== Historical overview ===
Although some evidence exists of occupation during the Late Archaic period (around 1200 BCE) in and around the site, Cahokia as it is now defined was settled around 600 CE during the Late Woodland period. Mound building at this location began with the emergent Mississippian cultural period, around the 9th century CE. The inhabitants left no written records beyond symbols on pottery, marine shell, copper, wood, and stone, but the evidence of elaborately planned community, woodhenge, mounds, and burials later in time reveal a complex and sophisticated society.

Cahokia became the most important center for the Mississippian culture. This culture was expressed in settlements that ranged along major waterways across what is now the Midwest, Eastern, and Southeastern United States. Cahokia was located in a strategic position near the confluence of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois rivers. It maintained trade links with communities as far away as the Great Lakes to the north and the Gulf Coast to the south, trading in such exotic items as copper, Mill Creek chert, shark teeth, and lightning whelk shells.
===Development (9th and 10th centuries)===
In the centuries preceding 1000 CE, American Bottom populations were living in small settlements of 50 to 100 people that were used for short durations of 5–10 years. At least two of these larger clusters were present at Cahokia, one dating to the mid-7th and 9th centuries. Later in time, many began to be constructed along cosmologically organizing principles, emphasizing cardinal directions and distinct sectors of society. By the end of the 10th century, many of these settlements aggregated into larger groups. These larger villages included the earlier cosmogram layouts complete with large central posts, pits, and/or structures.

An extensive nucleated community sprawled across in Cahokia proper, with its beginnings at the end in the late 900s CE. By this time it seems a few thousand people were living in the American Bottom region. Moundbuilding activity may have occurred at Cahokia proper but certainly did at one site to the north near Horseshoe Lake. These Late Woodland people were farmers but maize&#x27;s importance at this time was marginal. Its successful introduction occurred around 900 CE. Most of the crops grown at the time were from the Eastern Agricultural Complex suite, an older and endemic farming tradition.

===Rise and peak (11th and 12th centuries)===
In the years around 1050 CE, Cahokia experienced a “Big Bang.” The city-proper&#x27;s three urban precincts: St. Louis, East St. Louis, and Cahokia were all constructed at this time. At the same time, an ordered city grid—oriented to the north along the Grand Plaza, Rattlesnake Causeway, and dozens of mounds—was imposed on earlier Woodland settlements. This was accompanied by a homogenization of material culture (e.g. pottery and architectural styles) that divided the smaller settlements beforehand. Mound construction increased across the region in the 11th century in the floodplain and, for the first time, in the uplands to the east. Some mounds were built on earlier settlement locations—arguably by descendants emphasizing their particular ancestral positions in the new social order. All villages experienced either renewal and construction efforts turning them into mound centers, or were depopulated to become just a few households or a single farmstead. New settlement types including nucleated settlements, mound centers, small dispersed clusters of houses, and single-family farmsteads appeared throughout the region.

The city&#x27;s complex construction of earthen mounds required digging, excavation and transportation by hand using woven baskets. Construction made use of of earth, and much of the work was accomplished over decades. Its highly planned large, smoothed-flat, ceremonial plazas, sited around the mounds, with homes for thousands connected by laid out pathways and courtyards, suggest the location served as a central religious pilgrimage city.

At the high point of its development, Cahokia was the largest urban center north of the great Mesoamerican cities in Mexico and Central America. Home to about 1,000 people before &quot;circa&quot; 1050, its population grew rapidly after that date. According to a 2007 study in &quot;Quaternary Science Reviews&quot;, &quot;Between AD 1050 and 1100, Cahokia&#x27;s population increased from between 1,400 and 2,800 people to between 10,200 and 15,300 people&quot;, an estimate that applies only to a high-density central occupation area. As a result of archeological excavations in the early 21st century, new residential areas were found to the west of Cahokia; this discovery increased estimates of historic area population. Archaeologists estimate the city&#x27;s population at between 6,000 and 40,000 at its peak. If the highest population estimates are correct, Cahokia was larger than any subsequent city in the United States until the 1780s, when Philadelphia&#x27;s population grew beyond 40,000. Its population may have been larger than contemporaneous London and Paris.

Studies of Cahokia&#x27;s rise see large-scale immigration as an essential contributor to the city&#x27;s initial rapid growth. At the onset of the &quot;Big Bang,&quot; non-local ceramics begins to appear in higher frequencies across site types indicating interaction or immigration from populations around the lower Ohio Drainage (Yankeetown), Lower Mississippi Valley (Coles Creek), Upper Midwest (below), and south-central plains (Caddo). Many of these immigrants moved into outlying villages in the eastern uplands, referred to at the Richland Complex. Intensive farming and textile production occurred in these villages which has been interpreted as supplicant behavior directed towards the central urban core of the city. The novel practices these immigrant communities brought with them have been argued as essential to the creation of the character of Cahokia as a city. One such example, the common mound-and-plaza pairing, was adopted from longstanding Coles Creek organizational principles.

Contacts across the mid-continent and possibly beyond are attested to have reached a peak between 1050 and 1150 CE. Mill Creek chert from southwestern Illinois, most notably, was used in the production of hoes, a high demand tool for farmers around Cahokia and other Mississippian centers. Cahokia&#x27;s loose control over distribution, though not production, of these tools was important in emphasizing a new agricultural regime. Mississippian culture pottery and stone tools in the Cahokian style were found at the Silvernale site near Red Wing, Minnesota, and materials and trade goods from Pennsylvania, the Gulf Coast, and Lake Superior have been excavated at Cahokia. Cahokians traveled down to the Carson site in Coahoma County, Mississippi and built a settlement during the 12th century. Others paddled upriver to the site of Trempleau Bluffs in southern Wisconsin, to create a mounded religious center at the end of the 11th century.

It was during the Stirling phase (1100–1200 CE) that Cahokia was at its height of political centralization. Current academic discourse has emphasized religion as a major component in consolidating and maintaining the political power essential to Cahokia&#x27;s urbanity. The Emerald Acropolis mound site in the uplands, was a site where the moon, water, femininity, and fertility were venerated; the mounds were aligned to lunar events in its 18.6 year cycle. Immigrant ceramics early in the archaeological record argue that it was central in attracting immigrants as pilgrims. Political control was exercised in the Cahokian hinterlands at distinctive temple complexes consisting of T or L shaped structures and sweatlodges. Distinctive rituals have archaeologically documented at these complexes involving tobacco, red cedar, agricultural produce, and female Cahokian flint clay figurines. Intense public rituals, like the sacrifice of dozens of women at mound 72 and interment of powerful leaders in ridge top mortuary mounds, integrated populations in shared experiences and narratives of their world during the 11th and 12th centuries.

One of the major problems that large centers like Cahokia faced was keeping a steady supply of food, perhaps exacerbated by droughts from CE 1100–1250. A related problem was waste disposal for the dense population, and Cahokia is believed to have become unhealthy from polluted waterways. Because it was such an unhealthy place to live, Snow believes that the town had to rely on social and political attractions to bring in a steady supply of new immigrants; otherwise, the town&#x27;s death rate would have caused it to be abandoned earlier.

===Decline (13th and 14th centuries)===
By the end of the 12th century, two distinct events marked the beginning of Cahokia&#x27;s rearticulation and decline. Circa 1160–1170 CE. a large walled residential compound in the East St. Louis precinct was burned down. Multiple ritual structures that were filled with an unusual density of stone tools, exotic materials, and pots filled with shelled maize were included in this burning. The event possibly represented unrest in response to 12th century inequalities. The same area was later rebuilt but not for residential purposes. In the same general timeframe around 1175 CE, people constructed the first iteration of the large central palisade around Cahokia&#x27;s core. People began leaving the city in larger numbers beginning in the late 12th century. In the middle of the succeeding 13th century, Cahokia&#x27;s population had decreased by half if not more, and by 1350 CE the city was abandoned.
Scholars have proposed environmental factors, such as environmental degradation through overhunting, deforestation and pollution, and climatic changes, such as increased flooding and droughts, as explanations for abandonment of the site. However, more recent research suggests that there is no evidence of human-caused erosion or flooding at Cahokia.

The late 12th century into the turn of the 13th (the Moorehead phase, 1200–1300 CE) was one of change. People stopped constructing and using the earlier T and L shaped ritual buildings as well as large circular rotundas. Family homes were built larger and storage pits previously located outside of them were moved inside. Ceramic styles and production techniques shifted with an increase in plates, cord-marking, and solar-themed iconography. There was also an increase in cemeteries of grouped minor-elites outside of Cahokia. Though mound construction still occurred, it did so at a lesser rate. Many earlier mounds were ritually capped and ceased to be modified afterwards. Altogether, this has been taken as a time when centralized political structures were weakening and essential religious practices were rethought.

Political, economic, or cultural problems may also have contributed to the community&#x27;s decline. Thomas Emerson and Kristin Hedman argue that Cahokia&#x27;s large immigrant population was a factor in the city&#x27;s ultimate fragmentation, as differing languages, customs, and religions obstructed the creation of a cohesive Cahokian cultural identity. Analyses of Cahokian burial sites and the associated remains have also shown that many Cahokians were not native to the city or its immediate surrounding region. These immigrants were sometimes buried separately from native residents, a possible indicator of weak integration along ethnic lines. It is likely that social and environmental factors combined to produce the conditions that led people to leave Cahokia.

Cahokia&#x27;s connections to the surrounding regions seems to have shifted from one of direct contact and outpost construction to one of dispersal. The immigrant populations inhabiting upland villages in the so-called Richland Complex were some of the first to leave the city. Many people leaving Cahokia went south into the Cairo Lowlands of southern Illinois and further south in the Central Mississippi Valley. Later, some left for The Cumberland Basin in central Tennessee. Finely crafted artifacts from Cahokia, such as copper repoussé plates and engraved shell, appear at powerful centers such as Moundville and Etowah only after 1250 CE.

Another possible cause is invasion by outside peoples. Many theories since the late 20th century propose conquest-induced political collapse as the primary reason for Cahokia&#x27;s abandonment. Evidence of warfare found is defensive wooden stockade and watchtowers that enclosed Cahokia&#x27;s main ceremonial precinct. Multiple associated 13th century burned villages in the Illinois River Valley to the north speak to the rising tensions at the time. Palisades become popular across parts of the Midwest and mid-South during the 13th century as communities begin living together in much more nucleated settlement types. However, Cahokia&#x27;s palisade may have been more for ritual or formal separation than for military purposes, but bastioned palisades almost always indicate warfare. As Cahokia&#x27;s population shrank over the 13th century, Cahokia&#x27;s palisade was rebuilt several times to encompass increasingly-smaller portions of the city.

Diseases transmitted among the large, dense urban population are another possible cause of decline. Similarly, health issues like pellagra are known to arise through maize-intense diets like Cahokia&#x27;s. However, evidence tying nutritional deficiencies to a broader societal collapse has not been conclusively identified. At Cahokia&#x27;s beginning around CE 1050, hominy was made though nixtamalization that made the maize more nutritious. Recent research indicates that early Cahokians nixtamalized maize but then stopped nixtamalizing maize around CE 1200. Intense reliance on maize that is not nixtamalized may result in pellagra and death. Isotope analysis of burial remains at Cahokia has revealed iron-deficiency anemia and tooth enamel defects potentially stemming from Cahokia&#x27;s reliance on maize.

Together with these factors, researchers found evidence in 2015 of major floods at Cahokia, so severe as to flood dwelling places. Analysis of sediment from beneath Horseshoe Lake has revealed that two major floods occurred in the period of settlement at Cahokia, in roughly 1100–1260 and 1340–1460. While flooding may have occurred early in the rise of the city, it seems not to have deterred the city builders; to the contrary, it appears they took steps such as creating channels, dikes, and levees that protected at least the central city throughout its inhabited history. In another indication of flood mitigation efforts, Cahokians dispersed their agricultural lands among both lowland and upland fields, thereby reducing the chances that a single cataclysmic flood would wipe out the city&#x27;s food supply.

=== Abandonment and resettling (15th through 19th centuries) ===
Cahokia&#x27;s abandonment came in tandem with the abandonment of the wider surrounding region, referred to by scholars as &quot;the Vacant Quarter.&quot; Populations left what is now southern Illinois; the Lower Ohio Drainage in southern Indiana; nearly the entirety of western Kentucky and Tennessee; most of southeastern Missouri excepting the Bootheel; and the Upper Tombigbee drainage in northeastern Mississippi. The region may have been used by occasional hunting parties but there was no settlement of any substantial kind at Cahokia, nor in the wider region, from 1400 to 1600 CE. However archeologists discovered evidence in 2020 that there was a population rebound in the greater area following Cahokia&#x27;s population minimum in 1400, with the population reaching a population maximum in 1650 and then declining again in 1700.

Dhegiha Siouan migration was in part responsible for the depopulation of Cahokia. The city is the heritage of many contemporary Native American communities, the former group in particular. Ponca oral tradition specifies their ancestor&#x27;s time in Cahokia, calling the city or its location &quot;P&#x27;ahe zide&quot; [red hill]. Following the city&#x27;s abandonment as such, Algonquian groups from the east moved into the Vacant Quarter in the mid-17th century, specifically those of the Illinois Confederation. The Cahokia tribe was one such group and from whom the site gets its name.

While Cahokia proper had ceased to exist, the mounds continued to be present on the landscape. Various French settler-colonial families are documented to have claimed the land of the city during the 18th century. St. Louis was defined by the mounds that Cahokian&#x27;s had constructed across the river, referred to at one point as &quot;Mound City.&quot; Nearly all these mounds in Downtown St. Louis were destroyed and used for fill in the growing city&#x27;s construction in the mid-19th century. As Native Americans were forcibly removed from the land through treaties and war (particularly the Black Hawk&#x27;s War), their claim to the land and its usage was usurped. In downtown Cahokia a group of early 19th century (circa 1809) Trappist Monks lived on the grounds. Later the land was farmed by the Ramey family through the latter-half of the 19th century. This is when serious archaeological interest began as Euro-American settlers began trying to make sense of the site.

== Contemporary usage (post 19th-century) ==

=== Descendant communities ===

As one of the most impactful cities in the history of the North American continent, Cahokia&#x27;s reach has been extensive. Many Native American peoples and tribes recognize the site today as being important to their heritage. The Osage Nation is a primary collaborator with archaeologists and site management. One of the only remaining Mississippian mounds across the river in St. Louis, Sugarloaf mound, was purchased by the nation to care for it in posterity.

Many Indigenous people groups and nations including the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Muscogee-Creek, carry on their moundbuilding traditions similar to those of Cahokia. Native American people continue to venerate the site as sacred, coming to the grounds to perform ceremony and dance. The site has served as inspiration for much Native American art. Notably Howard Revard, an esteemed poet and member of Osage Nation, wrote about the site in &quot;Winning the Dust Bowl&quot;. Artist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, a member of Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, displayed the works, &quot;State Names Map: Cahokia&quot; and &quot;Trade Canoe: Cahokia,&quot; both inspired by the site, as part of an exhibit at St. Louis Art Museum.

=== Cahokia Museum and Interpretive Center ===

The Cahokia Museum and Interpretive Center, which receives up to a million visitors a year, was designed by AAIC Inc. The building, which opened in 1989, received the Thomas H. Madigan Award, the &quot;St. Louis Construction News &amp; Reviews&quot; Readers Choice Award, the Merit Award from the Metal Construction Association, and the Outstanding Achievement Award from the Brick Manufacturer Association.

=== Academia ===
Cahokia has long been a point of interest in the academic community. As early as the 1960s, universities across the Midwest have gone to the site to conduct research in fields ranging from geology to archaeology. One of the most prominent archaeological researchers of Cahokia is Timothy Pauketat. He has been writing about and researching Cahokia for the majority of his professional career. Other prominent Cahokia academics include Warren Wittry, who was instrumental in the recovery of Cahokia Woodhenge.

=== Designations ===
Cahokia Mounds was first protected by the state of Illinois in 1923 when its legislature authorized purchase of a state park. Later designation as a state historic site offered additional protection, but the site came under significant threat from the federal highway building program in the 1950s. The highway program reduced the site&#x27;s integrity; however, it increased funding for emergency archeological investigations. These investigations became intensive, and today continue. They have resulted in the present understanding of the national and international significance of the site. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 19, 1964, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

In 1982, UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) designated the site a World Heritage Site. This is the only such self-contained site in Illinois and among 24 World Heritage Sites in the United States in 2009.

State Senator Evelyn M. Bowles wrote about the Cahokia Mounds site:

The designation has helped protect the property and attract funds to conduct research on this significant civilization.

== Agriculture ==
Cahokia was surrounded by rich agricultural lands. The city has been traditionally thought to have been a maize-centric civilization, the crop having been introduced to the region around AD 900. While maize is often credited with enabling Cahokia&#x27;s early population growth, more recent research has suggested that Cahokian diets were quite varied, especially in the city&#x27;s early period of existence. A diversity of crops, such as goosefoot and sumpweed from the Eastern Agricultural Complex, were grown and eaten at Cahokia. Thomas Emerson and Kristin Hedman attribute the discovery of Cahokian individuals with low-maize diets to the existence of hunter-gatherer immigrant communities who had not yet adopted maize as a staple food source.

Residents of outlying areas relied heavily on maize for subsistence, while residents of Cahokia&#x27;s city center enjoyed more diverse diets. One interpretation is that higher levels of maize consumption may be correlated with a lower social status among Cahokian residents.

The impact that Cahokian agriculture had on the environment, and its relationship to the city&#x27;s ultimate collapse, is hotly debated. The depletion of farming soil surrounding Cahokia may have led to a decline in food resources that doomed the city. Jane Mt. Pleasant, however, argues that these models of Cahokia&#x27;s soil longevity are flawed, because it is based on modern understandings of crop yields that assume the use of plows. Cahokians&#x27; exclusive use of hand tools was less damaging to the soil and thus may have maintained soil quality far longer than is typical today, making a rapid collapse of agricultural productivity in Cahokia less likely.

Historian Daniel Richter notes that the apex of the city occurred during the Medieval Warming Period. This period appears to have fostered an agricultural revolution in upper North America, as the three-fold crops of maize, beans (legumes), and gourds (squash) were developed and adapted or bred to the temperate climates of the north from their origins in Mesoamerica. Richter also notes that Cahokia&#x27;s advanced development coincided with the development in the Southwest of the Chaco Canyon society, which also produced large-scale works in an apparent socially stratified society. The decline of the city coincides with the Little Ice Age, although by then, the three-fold agriculture remained well-established throughout temperate North America.

==Notable features==
The original site contained 120 earthen mounds over an area of , of which 80 remain today. To achieve that, thousands of workers over decades moved more than an estimated of earth in woven baskets to create this network of mounds and community plazas. Monks Mound, for example, covers , rises , and was topped by a massive building another high.

===Urban landscape===

Early in its history, Cahokia underwent a massive construction boom. Along with the early phase of Monks Mound, an overarching urban layout was established at the site. It was built with a symbolic quadripartite worldview and oriented toward the four cardinal directions with the main east–west and north–south axes defined with Monks Mound near its center point. Four large plazas were established to the east, west, north, and south of Monks Mound.

To the south of Monks Mound is the Grand Plaza, a large area that covered roughly and measured over in length by over in width. Researchers originally thought the flat, open terrain in this area reflected Cahokia&#x27;s location on the Mississippi&#x27;s alluvial flood plain, but instead soil studies have shown that the landscape was originally undulating ridge and swale topography. In one of the earliest large-scale construction projects, the site had been expertly and deliberately leveled and filled by the city&#x27;s inhabitants. It is part of the sophisticated engineering displayed throughout the site. It was used for large ceremonies and gatherings, as well as for ritual games, such as chunkey. The game was played by rolling a disc-shaped chunky stone across the field. The players would throw spears where they thought the chunky stone would land. The game required a great deal of judgment and aim.

The major ceremonial north–south &#x27;axis&#x27; connects the main precinct with the large ridgetop mortuary mound to its south now known as the Rattlesnake Mound (Mound 66). The feature, named the Rattlesnake Causeway by archaeologists, was an elevated embankment about wide, roughly in length and varies in height from to almost as it traverses a low swampy area to the south of the Grand Plaza. It is aligned 5° east of north, a direction thought to mimic the maximum southern moon rise of 5° west of north, albeit in reverse. This is thought to have had symbolic associations to the builders in connection with their lunar maize goddess of the underworld. This is further strengthened by its close proximity to the ridgetop mortuary Mound 72, the underworld connotations of the low water-filled area the causeway traversed, and its terminus at the mortuary complex at the Rattlesnake Mound. The causeway itself may have been seen as a symbolic &quot;Path of Souls&quot;.

The high-status central district of Cahokia was surrounded by a palisade that was equipped with protective bastions. A later addition to the site, when the palisade was constructed, it cut through and separated some pre-existing neighborhoods. Archaeologists found evidence of the stockade during excavation of the area and indications that it was rebuilt several times. Its bastions showed that it was mainly built for defensive purposes.

Beyond Monks Mound, as many as 120 more mounds stood at varying distances from the city center. To date, 109 mounds have been located, 68 of which are in the park area. The mounds are divided into three different types: platform, conical, and ridge-top. Each appeared to have had its own meaning and function. In general terms, the city center seems to have been laid out in a diamond-shaped pattern about from end to end, while the entire city is across from east to west.

=== Domestic architecture ===
Cahokian residential zones were arranged into carefully planned clusters around plazas and mounds. Specific delineations and functions have been hard to determine, but many of these clusters may have been designed to accommodate religious or ethnic segregations. Cahokia&#x27;s neighborhoods possessed a standardized suite of building types, including steam baths, council houses, and temples.

Cahokian domestic structures were generally of pole-and-thatch construction and followed rectangular footprints. Wall trenches were often used instead of posts for building construction.

Alleen Betzenhauser and Timothy Pauketat argue that upwards of 20 percent of Cahokia&#x27;s neighborhood structures did not serve domestic functions, but were rather intended to facilitate engagement with non-human spiritual beings as part of an animistic religion. These beings may have resided in the building itself or inhabited large marker posts, similar to the posts used to build the Cahokia Woodhenge. Betzenhauser and Pauketat compare their theorized Cahokian buildings to similar historical examples such as shaking tents or medicine lodges.

===Monks Mound===

Monks Mound is the largest structure and central focus of the city: a massive platform mound with four terraces, 10 stories tall, it is the largest man-made earthen mound north of Mexico. Facing south, it is high, long, wide and covers . It contains about of earth. The mound was built higher and wider over the course of several centuries, through as many as 10 separate construction episodes, as the mound was built taller and the terraces and apron were added.

Monks Mounds was named for the community of Trappist monks who resided there for a short time, after Euroamericans settled in the area. Excavation on the top of Monks Mound has revealed evidence of a large building, likely a temple or the residence of the paramount chief, which would have been seen throughout the city. This building was about long and wide, and could have been as much as high. It was about .

The east and northwest sides of Monks Mound were twice excavated in August 2007 during an attempt to avoid erosion due to slumping. These areas were repaired to preserve the mound.

===Mound 72===

During excavation of Mound 72, a ridge-top burial mound south of main urban precinct, archaeologists found the remains of about 270 individuals, including paired male/female burials. One burial (Feature 101) was buried on a bed of 10,000 marine-shell disc beads arranged in the shape of a falcon, with the bird&#x27;s head appearing beneath and beside the man&#x27;s head, and its wings and tail beneath his arms and legs. This burial is known as the Beaded Burial or Birdman. Other burials, such as the Exotic Cache Burial in the mound had exotic materials and huge quantities of shell beads.

The falcon warrior or &quot;birdman&quot; is a common motif in Mississippian culture. This burial clearly had powerful iconographic significance. In addition, a cache of sophisticated, finely worked arrowheads in a variety of different styles and materials was found near the grave of this important man. Separated into four types, each from a different geographical region, the arrowheads demonstrated Cahokia&#x27;s extensive trade links in North America.

Archeologists recovered more than 250 other skeletons from Mound 72. Scholars believe almost 62% of these were sacrificial victims, based on signs of ritual execution, method of burial, and other factors. The skeletons include:
* Four young males, missing their hands and skulls
* A mass grave of more than 50 women around 21 years old, with the bodies arranged in two layers separated by matting
* A mass burial containing 40 men and women who appear to have been violently killed, some of these may have been buried alive: &quot;From the vertical position of some of the fingers, which appear to have been digging in the sand, it is apparent that not all of the victims were dead when they were interred – that some had been trying to pull themselves out of the mass of bodies.&quot;

The relationship of these burials to the central burial is unclear. They were unlikely to have all deposited at the same time. Wood in several parts of the mound has been radiocarbon-dated to between 950 and 1000 CE.

Excavations have indicated that Mound 72 was not constructed as a single mound, but rather as a series of smaller mounds. These mounds were reshaped and covered over to give Mound 72 its final ridge-top shape.

===Copper workshop===


Excavations near Mound 34 from 2002 to 2010 revealed a copper workshop. This unique find was originally discovered in the 1950s by archaeologist Gregory Perino, but its exact location was lost for 60 years. It is the only known copper workshop to be found at a Mississippian culture site. The area contains the remains of three tree stumps thought to have been used to hold anvil stones. Analysis of copper found during excavations showed that it had been annealed, a technique involving repeatedly heating and cooling the metal as it is worked, as blacksmiths do with iron.

Artisans produced religious items, such as long-nosed god maskettes, ceremonial earrings with a symbolic shape, thought to have been used in fictive kinship rituals. Many of the stylistically related Mississippian copper plates, such as the Wulfing cache from southeastern Missouri, some of the Etowah plates from Georgia, and many of the Spiro plates from Oklahoma, are associated with the Greater Braden style and are thought to have been made in Cahokia in the 13th century.

===Cahokia Woodhenge===
The Cahokia Woodhenge was a series of large timber circles located roughly to the west of Monks Mound. They are thought to have been constructed between 900 and 1100 CE, with each one being larger and having 12 more posts than its predecessor. The site was discovered during salvage archaeology undertaken by Dr. Warren Wittry in the early 1960s interstate highway construction boom. Although the majority of the site contained village house features, a number of unusually shaped, large post holes were also discovered. When the holes were plotted out, they formed several arcs of equally spaced holes. Detailed analytical work supported the hypothesis that the placement of these posts was by design, and Wittry hypothesized that the arcs could be whole circles. He began referring to the circles as &quot;woodhenges&quot;, comparing the structures to England&#x27;s well-known circles at Woodhenge and Stonehenge.

The post holes found by Wittry are an example of how soil retains the memory of organic materials that decayed in the soil from thousands of years ago. Many soils have a naturally acidic component that breaks down most organic material pretty quickly, but leaves behind dark discoloration in the soil. The original posts of Cahokia Woodhenge left behind this same discoloration, allowing researchers to easily identify the soil as having once contained wooden posts.

Additional excavations in the 1960s–1980s used predictions based on verified posthole locations and spacing to locate other postholes and confirm the existence of five separate timber circles in the general vicinity. The circles are now designated Woodhenges I through V in Roman numerals. In 1985, a reconstruction of Woodhenge III was built with the posts being placed into the original excavated post positions. The circle, which has 48 posts in the circle and a 49th central post, has been used to investigate archaeoastronomy at Cahokia. The Illinois Historic Preservation Division that oversees the Cahokia site hosts public sunrise observations at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes and the winter and summer solstices. Out of respect for Native American beliefs, these events do not feature ceremonies or rituals of any kind.

== Greater Cahokia ==
Cahokia is recognized as one of the centers of a densely-populated collections of sites including East St. Louis, St. Louis Mounds, Janey B. Goode, and the Mitchell site. This region of sites is often referred to as &quot;Greater Cahokia&quot; because they were all inter-related.

==Related mounds==
Until the 19th century, a series of similar mounds was documented as existing in what is now the city of St. Louis, some to the west of Cahokia. Most of these mounds were leveled during the development of St. Louis, and much of their material was reused in construction projects.

One survivor of these mounds is Sugarloaf Mound. Located on the west bank of the Mississippi, it marked the initial border between St. Louis and the once autonomous city of Carondelet. The basal remnant of another likely related mound is located in O&#x27;Fallon Park in St. Louis.

One of the largest Mississippian sites is Kincaid Mounds State Historic Site, located in Massac and Polk counties in southern Illinois. It is southeast of Cahokia, located in the floodplain of the Ohio River. With a total of 19 mounds at the complex, it is considered the fifth-largest Mississippian site in terms of the number of monuments. It is believed to have been a chiefdom, as an elite burial mound was among those found. The site is designated as a National Historic Landmark.

<text>The alpine accentor (Prunella collaris) is a small passerine bird in the family Prunellidae, which is native to Eurasia and North Africa.

==Taxonomy==
The Alpine accentor was described by the Austrian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1769. He coined the binomial name &quot;Sturnus collaris&quot; and specified the type locality as the Carinthia region of southern Austria. The specific epithet is from the Latin &quot;collaris&quot; &quot;of the neck&quot;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Prunella&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The Alpine accentor, along with the Altai accentor is sometimes separated from the other accentors, into the genus &quot;Laiscopus&quot;.

The word &quot;accentor&quot; is from post-classical Latin and means a person who sings with another. The genus name &quot;Prunella&quot; is from the German &quot;Braunelle&quot;, &quot;dunnock&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;braun&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;.

Nine subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. c. collaris&quot; — southwest Europe to Slovenia and the Carpathians, northwest Africa
* &quot;P. c. subalpina&quot; — Croatia to Bulgaria and Greece, Crete and southwest Turkey
* &quot;P. c. montana&quot; — north and east Turkey to the Caucasus and Iran
* &quot;P. c. rufilata&quot; — northeast Afghanistan and north Pakistan through the mountains of central Asia to west China
* &quot;P. c. whymperi&quot; — west Himalayas
* &quot;P. c. nipalensis&quot; — central and east Himalayas to southcentral China and north Myanmar
* &quot;P. c. tibetana&quot; — east Tibet
* &quot;P. c. erythropygia&quot; — east Kazakhstan and southcentral Siberia to northeast Siberia, Japan, Korea and northeast China
* &quot;P. c. fennelli&quot; — Taiwan

== Description==

This is a robin-sized bird at in length, slightly larger than its relative, the dunnock. It has a streaked brown back, somewhat resembling a house sparrow, but adults have a grey head and red-brown spotting on the underparts. It has an insectivore&#x27;s fine pointed bill.

Sexes are similar, although the male may be contrasted in appearance. Young birds have browner heads and underparts.
==Distribution and habitat==

It is found throughout the mountains of southern temperate Europe, Lebanon and Asia at heights above . It is mainly resident, wintering more widely at lower latitudes, but some birds wander as rare vagrants as far as Great Britain.

It is a bird of bare mountain areas with some low vegetation.

==Breeding==

It builds a neat nest low in a bush or rock crevice, laying 3–5 unspotted sky-blue eggs.

The mating system is of particular interest. Home ranges are occupied by breeding groups of 3 or 4 males with 3 or 4 females. These are unrelated birds which have a socially polygynandrous mating system. Males have a dominance hierarchy, with the alpha males being generally older than subordinates. Females seek matings with all the males, although the alpha male may defend her against matings from lower ranking males. In turn, males seek matings with all the females. DNA fingerprinting has been used to show that, within broods, there is often mixed paternity, although the female is always the true mother of the nestlings raised within her nest. Males will provide food to chicks at several nests within the group, depending on whether they have mated with the female or not – males only provide care when they are likely to be the true fathers of the chicks.

<text>Erik Hersholt Nielsen (February 24, 1924 – September 4, 2008) was a Canadian lawyer and politician. He served as the longtime Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Yukon, and was Leader of the Opposition and the third deputy prime minister of Canada. He was the elder brother of actor Leslie Nielsen.

==Early life, family, and education==
Nielsen was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, the eldest of three boys. His mother, Mabel Elizabeth (née Davies), was an immigrant from Wales, and his father, Ingvard Eversen Nielsen, was a Danish-born constable in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Nielsen&#x27;s family lived mainly in Alberta during his formative years, and he graduated from high school in Edmonton in 1942.

==World War II==
Nielsen joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1942, just after graduation, and received his training mainly in Alberta. He flew 33 missions in No. 101 Squadron RAF in World War II, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for &quot;courage and devotion to duty&quot;. He earned the rank of lieutenant. He rejoined the RCAF, 1946–1951, as a legal officer, while earning a law degree at Dalhousie University. He established his law practice in Whitehorse, Yukon.

==Parliament==
Nielsen was elected to parliament in late 1957 (Nielsen lost in the 1957 federal election, but the result was controverted and Nielsen won the resulting byelection) and remained an MP without interruption for 30 years. He was a backbench MP during the Diefenbaker government but became prominent during the Conservative Party&#x27;s long period in Opposition during the 1960s and 1970s joining the shadow cabinet in 1964. In 1978, he ran for the leadership of the newly formed Yukon Progressive Conservative Party as it prepared for the territory&#x27;s first partisan elections but was defeated by Hilda Watson by one vote.

With the 1979 federal election, the Tories formed government for the first time in over 15 years and Nielsen was appointed Minister of Public Works in the short-lived minority government of Prime Minister Joe Clark. After the Tories were defeated in the 1980 election, he served as Opposition House Leader from 1981 until 1983, and engineered the &quot;Bell Ringing Affair&quot; to protest the Liberal government&#x27;s omnibus energy bill. The business of the House of Commons of Canada ground to a halt for three weeks because the Opposition refused to respond to the bell summoning Members of Parliament to come to the chamber to vote.

Nielsen served as Leader of the Opposition in 1983 between the resignation of Joe Clark and the election of Brian Mulroney as PC leader, and continued to lead the party in the House until Mulroney won a seat in a by-election, at which point Nielsen returned to his previous position as House Leader.

When Mulroney became prime minister, he made Nielsen his deputy prime minister from 1984 to 1986, and President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada from 1984 to 1985. Nielsen was effectively the senior Government House Leader in all but name. He also served as Minister of National Defence from 1985 to 1986.

Nielsen was sometimes called &quot;Yukon Erik&quot;, (a reference to wrestler Yukon Eric of the 1950s) but he was also called &quot;Velcro lips&quot; for a tight-lipped reticence during his time in office. The tenaciousness and aggressiveness that made Nielsen a successful Opposition MP made him a liability as a Cabinet minister as he gave the impression of being secretive and disdainful of criticism by the Opposition and the media. His habit of stonewalling questions had the effect of prolonging the shelf life of political scandals in Parliament, and thus hurt the government&#x27;s reputation. This became most apparent during the Sinclair Stevens conflict-of-interest scandal, in which Mulroney was out of Parliament for two weeks while the opposition barraged Nielsen with questions. Shortly after Mulroney returned in June 1986, he forced both Nielsen and Stevens to resign from cabinet.

Nielsen resigned his seat in Parliament in January 1987 when he was given the position of chairman of the National Transportation Agency. He withdrew from the public service in 1992 to become president of Solar Engineering, Hawaii Inc. and Solar Electric Engineering Distributors Canada.

One of Nielsen&#x27;s brothers was actor Leslie Nielsen. The relationship formed the premise of an HBO mockumentary titled &quot;The Canadian Conspiracy&quot;, comically alleging a Canadian subversion of the United States through its media. Nielsen was also a nephew of actor Jean Hersholt.

Nielsen wrote a memoir, &quot;The House Is Not a Home&quot; (1989, ), noted for its bracing directness both about his colleagues and about his own personal life.

He died at his home in Kelowna, British Columbia on September 4, 2008, from a massive heart attack. On December 15, the government of Yukon renamed the main airport at Whitehorse, the capital of the territory, to Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport in Nielsen&#x27;s memory.

<doc id="348471" wikidata="Q308865" url="?curid=348471" title="Tetramorium atratulum">
<text>Tetramorium atratulum is a rare workerless socially parasitic ant from the Palaearctic region, which has even been introduced together with its host in North America. This extreme inquiline is represented only by female and pupoid type male individuals, whose morphology and anatomy indicate a highly specialized level of parasitism. The body of males is depigmentated, the cuticle is thin, the petiole and postpetiole are widely connected, and degenerate mandibles, palps, and antennae are observed. Female wing venation is reduced and the occipital region is narrowed. Mature females are typically physogastric and found in queenless host nests.

Since, unlike many other obligate social parasites, &quot;T. atratulum&quot; is never known to coexist with the host colony&#x27;s fertile queen, every &quot;T. atratulum&quot;–&quot;Tetramorium&quot; sp. colony is doomed to survive only the lifespan of the youngest &quot;Tetramorium&quot; sp. workers. Thus, the parasitic queen has very limited scope for producing alates to secure the next generation, as this time span is often only 2–3 years or fewer. As a result, even within its well-established range, &quot;T. atratulum&quot; is very scarce, with only a tiny proportion of &quot;Tetramorium&quot; sp. colonies playing host to this parasite.

==Distribution==
Its distribution is local over Eurosiberia and eastern parts of North America, broadly following that of its hosts. It is present but local in southern parts of Great Britain, having first been discovered in the UK by H. St. J. K. Donisthorpe and W. C. Crawley on July 23, 1912, in the New Forest.

==Hosts==
Although &quot;T. atratulum&quot; was reported previously mainly in &quot;Tetramorium caespitum&quot; and &quot;T. impurum&quot; nests, and was recently found in a nest of &quot;T. immigrans&quot; (species within the &quot;Tetramorium caespitum&quot;/&quot;impurum&quot; complex), it was also recorded from Sicily (Italy) from a nontypical low altitude (300  m) in a nest of &quot;T. diomedeum&quot;, which is a member of the &quot;Tetramorium ferox&quot; complex. Future clarification of the complicated taxonomic composition of the &quot;Tetramorium caespitum&quot;/&quot;impurum&quot; complex will probably enlarge the number of known host ant species parasitized by &quot;T. atratulum&quot;.

The only report about &quot;T. chefketi&quot; as a host of &quot;T. atratulum&quot; was given by Schulz &amp; Sanetra (2002) as an amendment of the identified material published by Heinze (1987) from Tavşanlı (Turkey, Kütahya district). &quot;Tetramorium moravicum&quot; was also mentioned in Sanetra &amp; Buschinger (2000) as a possible host of &quot;T. atratulum&quot;, but without any additional data and references.

<doc id="348472" wikidata="Q385750" url="?curid=348472" title="Lady Amherst's pheasant">
<text>Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasant (Chrysolophus amherstiae) is a bird of the order Galliformes and the family Phasianidae. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;khrusolophos&quot;, &quot;with golden crest&quot;. The English name and &quot;amherstiae&quot; commemorates Sarah Amherst, who was responsible for sending the first specimen of the bird to London in 1828. It is also sometimes referred to as the Chinese copper pheasant. Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasant is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is native to southwestern China and far northern Myanmar, but has been introduced elsewhere. Previously, a self-supporting feral population was established in England, the stronghold of which was in West Bedfordshire. Lady Amherst first introduced the ornamental pheasant on her estates, near the Duke of Bedford&#x27;s Woburn Abbey, where the birds were also shot for game and interbred. Although the introduced British populations are believed to have been extinct since 2015, occasional sightings of the species have occurred in subsequent years; a Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasant was photographed in Staplegrove, Taunton in May 2020, and subsequently, in early March 2021, a Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasant was spotted in a garden in Scotland. In October 2022, a Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasant was spotted in a park in Bedford.

==Description==
The adult male is in length, its tail accounting for of the total length. It is unmistakable with its nuchal cape which is white black, with a red crest. The long tail is greyish white with black bars and red streaks at the base, the chest and belly are white, the throat is scaled green, the back is dark green, the wings are blue and brown, and the rump is yellow. The &quot;cape&quot; can be raised in display. This species is closely related to the golden pheasant (&quot;C. pictus&quot;), but slightly larger and has a yellow eye, blue-green bare skin around it. The bill is horn-coloured and they have blue-gray legs. 
The female is much less showy, with a duller mottled brown plumage all over, similar to that of the female common pheasant (&quot;P. colchicus&quot;) but with finer barring. She is very like the female golden pheasant, but has a darker head and cleaner underparts than the hen of that species.

Despite the male&#x27;s showy appearance, these birds are very difficult to see in their natural habitat, which is dense, dark forests with thick undergrowth. Consequently, little is known of their behaviour in the wild.

==Diet and behaviour==
They feed on the ground on grain, leaves and invertebrates, but roost in trees at night. Whilst they can fly, they prefer to run, but if startled they can suddenly burst upwards at great speed, with a distinctive wing sound. The male emits a metallic call in the breeding season.

<doc id="348476" wikidata="Q2411268" url="?curid=348476" title="Neolin">
<text>Neolin (meaning &quot;the enlightened&quot; in Algonquian) was a prophet of the Lenni Lenape (also known as &quot;Delaware&quot;) from the village of Muskingum in Ohio. Neolin was active in the 1760s, but his exact dates of birth and death are unknown.

Inspired by a religious vision in 1761, Neolin proclaimed that Native Americans needed to reject the goods and lifestyles of the European settlers and return to a more traditional lifestyle, specifically by rejecting alcohol, materialism, and polygamy. Neolin&#x27;s message was a direct inspiration for Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion.

== Biography ==

In 1761, Neolin went through a period of fasting, incantation and dreaming, during which he claimed to have been visited by the Master of Life (&quot;Keesh-she&#x27;-la-mil&#x27;-lang-up&quot;, or &quot;being that thought us into being&quot;). In his vision, Neolin was called to visit the Master of Life. He prepared as if for a hunt. His journey led him along a path which eventually forked into 3 roads. Neolin sheltered at the fork as night fell, where he noticed &quot;the three roads became all the brighter the darker it grew, a thing that surprised him to a point of fear&quot;. At sunrise, Neolin set out upon the most expansive of the three roads, where he &quot;suddenly saw a great fire coming out of the earth&quot;. He returned to the crossroads and picked a second road, which again led to a pillar of fire. Returning again to the fork, Neolin picked the third road, which led him to &quot;what appeared to be a mountain of marvelous whiteness, and he stopped, overcome with astonishment&quot;. While at the mountain, he encountered a beautiful woman who explained that he must strip naked and cleanse himself in the nearby river in order to be allowed to visit the Master of Life. After doing so, the woman told him that &quot;he must use only his left hand and his left foot in the ascent&quot;. Neolin did as he was told and arrived at a village at the top of the mountain, naked and tired from the ascent. A voice told him that he may enter the village because he had cleansed himself in the river. At the gate, he was greeted by a man dressed in all white who led him to the Master of Life. The Master of Life took Neolin&#x27;s hand, gave him a &quot;hat all bordered with gold,&quot; and said, &quot;I am He who hath created the heavens and the earth, the trees, lakes, rivers, all men, and all thou seest and hath seen upon the earth. Because I love you, ye must do what I say and love, and not do what I hate&quot;. The Master of Life told Neolin that He was displeased with his people&#x27;s &quot;addiction to the white man&#x27;s alcohol, and deplored Indian polygamy, sexual promiscuity, witchcraft, and strife&quot;. Further, the Indians&#x27; greatest offense was tolerating the European settlers on their lands. The Master of Life promised to restore the lands with game and prosperity if the Indians returned to monogamous sexuality, lived by the bow and arrow, dressed themselves in animal skins, stopped drinking alcohol, and rejected &quot;further European incursions&quot;.

In 1762, Neolin claimed to receive a prayer from the Master of Life to be said every morning and evening. Neolin&#x27;s greatest work was the &quot;Great Book of Writing&quot;, a chart in which he mapped the path a soul must take to get to heaven. This description of the &#x27;path to happiness&#x27; was portrayed by Neolin on a diagram, inscribed on a deer hide. The diagram &quot;drew a path from earth to heaven ascending to happiness&quot;. Each path was blocked by &#x27;strokes&#x27; which represented the vices brought by the Europeans. To reach happiness, an individual would need to follow the narrow path on the diagram and avoid each of these vices. He declared that, &quot;to help the Indian remember these teachings, Neolin advised the hearers to obtain a copy of the Bible, which he offered to reproduce at the fixed rate of one buckskin or two doeskins each&quot;.

Hundreds of native people in the area later known as Ohio became disciples of Neolin. Neolin taught that Native Americans had been corrupted by European ways and needed to purify themselves by returning to their traditions and preparing for a holy war. &quot;Drive them out,&quot; he declared of the settlers. A group of chiefs, most prominently chief Pontiac of the Odawa, gained influence by adopting Neolin&#x27;s ideas and organized a confederacy of tribes in the Great Lakes region. Pontiac and his allies planned a coordinated attack against the British in the spring of 1763. Neolin rejected the uprising and called for the tribes to lay down their arms, but Pontiac&#x27;s War persisted despite his appeal. The conflict was one of many Native American anti-colonial resistance movements inspired by religious leadership.

== Legacy ==
The Trout, also called Maya-Ga-Wy, was an Ottawa prophet on the scene in the early 1800s. He was noted for having carried on the legacy of Neolin and Pontiac, advocating the return to traditional ways as a means of combating European domination. His beliefs went further, not only condemning alcohol and the fur trade with whites, but also the consumption of bread (&quot;food of the Whites&quot;) and the wearing of hats.
Neolin&#x27;s teachings, as adopted by Pontiac, affected the policy &quot;of nearly twenty tribes from Lake Ontario to the Mississippi, including among them the Ojibwa, Ottawa, Potawatomi, Seneca, Huron, Miami, Shawnee, and Delaware.&quot; Pontiac was known to use &quot;Neolin&#x27;s message as a slogan ... to attract warriors&quot; for the military movement on Detroit&quot;.

Historians have speculated that Neolin&#x27;s prophecy was influenced by his exposure to Christianity by European settlers. Many aspects of Neolin&#x27;s vision seem to borrow from Christian mythology, including the pillars of fire, diverging roads, ascension to heaven, the voice of God, and the promise of a halo. Most significantly, Neolin&#x27;s story mirrors the Book of Exodus, in which Moses receives the Ten Commandments atop Mount Sinai and delivers them to the Israelites. Neolin&#x27;s message also closely reflects the Christian value of self-control as a virtue in the rejection of sin.

<text>The Standard is an English-language free newspaper in Hong Kong with a daily circulation of 200,450 in 2012. It was formerly called the Hongkong Standard and changed to HKiMail during the Internet boom but partially reverted to &quot;The Standard&quot; in 2001.

The &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; (SCMP) is its main local competitor.

==Format==
&quot;The Standard&quot; is printed in tabloid format rather than in broadsheet. It is published daily from Monday to Friday.

==Ownership==
, &quot;The Standard&quot; was published by Hong Kong iMail Newspapers Limited (previously known as Hong Kong Standard Newspapers Limited) but currently The Standard Newspapers Publishing Limited. These enterprises are owned by Sing Tao News Corporation Limited, also the publisher of &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot; and &quot;Headline Daily.&quot;

&quot;The Standard&quot; was previously owned by Sally Aw&#x27;s Sing Tao Holdings Limited. Aw is the daughter of the founder Aw Boon Haw. In 1999 Holdings was acquired by a private equity fund, and in January 2001 by Charles Ho&#x27;s listed company Global China Technology Group Limited (whose name was changed to Sing Tao News Corporation Limited in February 2005). In mid-2002 the ownership of an intermediate holding company of &quot;The Standard,&quot; Sing Tao Media Holdings, was transferred to Sing Tao News Corporation. At the same time Sing Tao Holdings, without its main business, was sold to a Chinese private company.

==History==
&quot;The Standard&quot; was originally named the &quot;Hong Kong Tiger Standard.&quot; The newspaper was founded by Tycoon Aw Boon Haw after the end of the Chinese Civil War. He incorporated the publisher The Tiger Standard Limited on 23 May 1947. On the back of financially successful Sing Tao Daily and Tiger Balm, he attacked the English-language newspaper market by launching the paper on 1 March 1949 to give a Chinese voice to the world and to advance the interests of Chinese in all their endeavours and defend them against all kinds of inequalities, challenging the pro-colonial establishment press. It started life as a broadsheet, largely edited and run by Chinese, though not to the exclusion of other nationals. Politically, it shared the Sing Tao and Aw&#x27;s allegiance to the Kuomintang.

These early editors were all thoroughly U.S. educated and trained, the first being L.Z. Yuan (father-in-law of Golden Harvest founder, Raymond Chow). There followed C.S. Kwei, a leading Chinese lawyer and bilingual intellectual–author, and Kyatang Woo, an alumnus of University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. In 1985 Robert Chow, who later became a staunch and vocal pro-establishment advocate of restrictive democratic elections for Hong Kong&#x27;s chief executive, became the editor in chief of &quot;The Standard&quot; and worked there until the 1990s.

During the 1990s, when Sally Aw (Aw Sian, adopted daughter of Aw Boon Haw) chaired Sing Tao News Corporation Limited, &quot;The Standard&quot; was the only English newspaper in Hong Kong that was allowed to be circulated in China.

In 1994 a third English-language newspaper, the &quot;Eastern Express,&quot; appeared. Its bold headlines and large photographs provoked a radical redesign at the Standard, which also suffered the loss of a great many reporters, sub-editors, and advertising to the Eastern Express, tempted by its boasts of generous pay. The new paper quickly pushed the Standard into third place for full-price sales. The Standard adopted a distinctive orange and black masthead and an advertising campaign that used a carrot logo and the maxim &quot;clearer vision.&quot; Meanwhile, an emergency recruitment drive brought in new staff from the UK and Tasmania, mostly from regional newspapers and on fixed contracts. Its Sunday supplement, Hong Kong Life, began free distribution in bars and clubs.

On 27 May 2000, facing challenges from its biggest competitor the &quot;South China Morning Post,&quot; the &quot;Hongkong Standard&quot; was renamed &quot;Hong Kong iMail&quot; () and reduced to tabloid size to attract more younger readers, and was refocused on business issues. On 30 May 2002, following the burst of the dot-com bubble, the paper reverted to being &quot;The Standard.&quot;

The current editor in chief is Ivan Tong, who replaced Mark Clifford.

From 10 September 2007, &quot;The Standard,&quot; then sold at HK$6, became a free newspaper. It is now Hong Kong&#x27;s first and only free English newspaper. The newspaper is considered pro-Beijing in its editorial stance.

===Circulation fraud===
In August 1996 the Independent Commission Against Corruption in Hong Kong found that 14,000 copies of the paper had been discarded at Wan Chai Pier and therefore started an investigation. The ICAC discovered that from 1994 to 1997 the circulation figures of the &quot;Hong Kong Sunday Standard&quot; and the &quot;Hongkong Standard&quot; had been routinely and substantially exaggerated, in order to attract advertisers and to raise the revenue of the newspapers. Circulation figures had always been somewhat obscure, owing to the Sing Tao group&#x27;s longstanding agreements with hotels and clubs where the newspaper was distributed free.

As a result, the ICAC arrested three staff members of the &quot;Hongkong Standard&quot; and investigated Aw Sian as co-conspirator. The case was heard from 23 November 1998 to 20 January 1999, at the conclusion of which all three were found guilty and sentenced to 4 to 6 months in jail. Aw Sian was not charged, after the secretary of justice Elsie Leung decided not to prosecute her owing to insufficient evidence and in the public interest. The decision generated controversy among a skeptical public who saw this as discrimination in favour of the powerful and well-connected.

<text>Dušan D. Repovš (born November 30, 1954) is a Slovenian mathematician from Ljubljana, Slovenia.

== Education and academic career ==
He graduated in 1977 from the University of Ljubljana. He obtained his PhD in 1983 from Florida State University with thesis &quot;Generalized Three-Manifolds with Zero-Dimensional Singular Set&quot; written under the direction of Robert Christopher Lacher. He held a fellowship from the Research Council of Slovenia and a Fulbright scholarship.

In 1993 he was promoted to Professor of Geometry and Topology at the University of Ljubljana, where he is employed at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics and at the Faculty of Education, as the Head of the Chair for Geometry and Topology. Since 1983 he has been the leader of the Slovenian Nonlinear Analysis, Topology and Geometry Group at the Institute of Mathematics, Physics and Mechanics in Ljubljana, and has directed numerous national and international research grants (with the United States, Japan, Russian Federation, China, France, Italy, Spain, Israel, United Kingdom, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and others). The Slovenian Research Agency has selected this group among the best research program groups in Slovenia.

Repovš is the leading Slovenian expert on nonlinear analysis and topology and is one of the best known Slovenian mathematicians. He has published over 450 research papers and has given numerous invited talks at various international conferences and universities around the world.

His research interests are in nonlinear analysis and its applications, topology, and algebra. He first became known in the 1980s for his results in geometric topology, notably the solution of the classical recognition problem for 3-manifolds, the proof of the 4-dimensional Cellularity Criterion, and the proof of the Lipschitz case of the classical Hilbert–Smith conjecture. Presently he is most actively investigating in nonlinear analysis. Later he extended his research to several other areas and is currently most actively investigating problems of partial differential equations. He covers a very broad spectrum: problems with nonstandard growth (variable exponents, anisotropic problems, double-phase problems), qualitative analysis of solutions of semilinear and quasilinear PDEs (Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions), singular and degenerate problems (blow-up boundary, singular reactions), inequality problems (variational, hemivariational, both either stationary or evolutionary). His analysis of these problems combines fine methods at the interplay between nonlinear functional analysis, critical point theory, variational, topological and analytic methods, mathematical physics, and others.

== Bibliography ==
He has published a monograph on nonlinear analysis, a monograph on partial differential equations with variable exponents, a monograph on continuous selections of multivalued mappings, and a monograph on higher-dimensional generalized manifolds, as well as also a university textbook on topology. He is serving on the editorial boards of the Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, Advances in Nonlinear Analysis, Boundary Value Problems, Complex Variables and Elliptic Equations, and others.

== Memberships ==
He is a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts, the New York Academy of Sciences, the American Mathematical Society, the European Mathematical Society, the London Mathematical Society, the Mathematical Society of Japan, the Moscow Mathematical Society, the French Mathematical Society, the Swiss Mathematical Society, the Italian Mathematical Society and the Austrian Mathematical Society. He is also a founding member of the Slovenian Engineering Academy.

== Awards ==
For his outstanding research he was awarded in 2014 the honorary doctorate by the University of Craiova, in 2009 the Bogolyubov Memorial Medal by the Ukrainian Mathematical Congress in Kyiv and in 1997 the Prize of the Republic of Slovenia for Research (now called the Zois Prize). For his promotion of the Slovenian science abroad he received in 1995 the honorary title of the Ambassador for Science of the Republic of Slovenia.

<doc id="348486" wikidata="Q2778016" url="?curid=348486" title="Trinity Broadcasting Network">
<text>The Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN; legally Trinity Broadcasting of Texas, Inc.) is an international Christian-based broadcast television network and the world&#x27;s largest religious television network. TBN was headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, until March 3, 2017, when it sold its highly visible office park, Trinity Christian City. The broadcaster retained its studios in nearby Tustin. 

Auxiliary studio facilities are located in Irving, Hendersonville, Gadsden, Decatur, Miami and Orlando, Tulsa and New York City. TBN has characterized itself as broadcasting programs hosted by a diverse group of ministries from Evangelical, traditional Protestant and Catholic denominations, non-profit charities, Messianic Jewish and other Christian media personalities. TBN also offers a wide range of original programming, faith-based films, and political opinion commentary from various distributors.

The TBN corporation owns and operates four broadcast networks in the United States—TBN, TBN Inspire, Positiv and Enlace—as well as a number of religious networks in other countries. Matt Crouch has been TBN&#x27;s president and head of operations since 2015.

==History==
The Trinity Broadcasting Network was co-founded as the Trinity Broadcasting Systems in 1973 by Paul Crouch, an Assemblies of God minister, and his spouse Jan Crouch. TBN began its broadcasting activities by renting time on the independent station KBSA (now UniMás owned-and-operated station KFTR-DT) in Ontario, California. After that station was sold, he began buying two hours a day of programming time on KLXA-TV in Fontana, California, in early 1974. That station was put up for sale shortly afterward. Paul Crouch then placed a bid to buy the station for $1 million and raised $100,000 for a down payment. After many struggles, the Crouches managed to raise the down payment and took over the station outright, with the station becoming KTBN-TV in 1977 and its city of license being reassigned to TBN&#x27;s original homebase, Santa Ana, in 1983.

Initially, the station ran Christian programs for about six hours a day, expanding its programming to 12 hours a day by 1975, and began selling time to other Christian organizations to supplement its local programming. The station eventually instituted a 24-hour schedule in 1978.
The fledgling network was so weak in its first days, that, according to Crouch in his autobiography, &quot;Hello World!&quot;, it almost went bankrupt after just two days on the air. TBN began national distribution through cable television providers in 1978. The ministry, which became known as the Trinity Broadcasting Network, gained national distribution via communications satellite in 1982. The network was a member of the National Religious Broadcasters association until 1990.

In 1977, the ministry purchased KPAZ-TV in Phoenix, Arizona, becoming its second television station property. During the 1980s and 1990s, TBN purchased additional independent television stations and signed on new stations around the United States; the purchase of the existing stations was done in order to gain cable carriage, due to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s must-carry rules. TBN&#x27;s availability eventually expanded to 95% of American households by early 2005.

==Broadcast outlets==

TBN owns 35 full-power television stations serving larger metropolitan areas in the United States; at its peak, the network also owned 252 low-power television stations, which are mixed among stations serving medium-sized cities and rural translator stations in order to maximize the network&#x27;s reach as much as is permissible. TBN also has several hundred affiliate stations throughout the United States, although just 61 of these are full-power UHF or VHF stations; the rest are low-powered stations, requiring a viewer to be within several miles of the transmitter to receive the signal. According to &quot;TVNewsCheck&quot;, TBN was the third largest over-the-air television station group in the country as of 2010, besting the station groups of CBS, Fox and NBC, but behind Ion Media Networks and Univision Communications.

Many of TBN&#x27;s stations are owned by the ministry outright, while others are owned through the subsidiary Community Educational Television, in order to own stations that TBN cannot acquire directly due to FCC ownership limits (which restrict companies from owning stations with a combined market reach of 39% of the United States), or are allocated for educational use and require additional programming to comply with that license purpose. TBN&#x27;s programming is available by default via a national feed distributed to cable and satellite providers in markets without a local TBN station (this contrasts with the major commercial networks, which under FCC regulations, allow providers to import an owned-and-operated or affiliate station from a nearby market if no local over-the-air affiliate exists).

Worldwide, TBN&#x27;s channels are broadcast on 70 satellites and over 18,000 television and cable affiliates. The TBN networks are also streamed live on the internet globally; the network also provides select archived shows on demand, through the website and select IPTV services.

During 2010, citing economic problems and a lack of donations, TBN closed down and sold many of its low-powered television repeaters. Of those, 17 were sold to another Christian television network, Daystar. On April 13, 2012, TBN sold 36 of its translators to Regal Media, a broadcasting group headed by George Cooney, the CEO of EUE/Screen Gems.

Another 151 translators were donated to the Minority Media and Television Council (MMTC), an organization designed to preserve equal opportunity and civil rights in the media; MMTC would later sell 78 of these translators to Luken Communications, parent company of the Retro Television Network. Four more translators in Dothan, Alabama; Kirksville, Missouri; Jonesboro, Arkansas; and Jackson, Tennessee, were sold by MMTC to New Moon Communications, with the intent to convert them into NBC affiliates. However, in September 2012, New Moon put all four of these translators for sale. Only Gray Television would purchase a transmitter in Dothan, which was converted into NBC affiliate WRGX-LD; the licenses in Ottumwa (KUMK-LP) and Jackson (WZMC-LP) would later be canceled (the NBC affiliate in Jackson, WNBJ-LD, operates using a different license). Its Jonesboro transmitter, KJNE-LP remained silent but with an active license; however, that market&#x27;s ABC affiliate KAIT ended up obtaining the NBC affiliation instead, via a subchannel. KJNE-LP ended up becoming a translator station of Fox affiliate KJNB-LD. Another 44 of the licenses that were donated by TBN to the MMTC would be canceled on December 1, 2011, due to remaining silent for over a year.

On October 22, 2012, TBN acquired WRBJ-TV in Jackson, Mississippi from Roberts Broadcasting. Following FCC and bankruptcy court approval on January 17, 2013, TBN officially took over operational control of WRBJ on May 24, 2013, dropping all secular and CW network programming and converting it into a full-time satellite of TBN (the network was previously available in the Jackson area on WJKO-LP, which was later sold to Daystar).

On July 8, 2013, TBN announced an affiliation with the Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada religious station Miracle Channel; as part of the agreement, Miracle Channel added some of TBN&#x27;s flagship programs, including &quot;Praise The Lord&quot; and &quot;Behind The Scenes&quot;, while TBN picked up programs shown on Miracle Channel, including services from the Springs Church (of which Miracle Channel CEO Leon Fontaine is a pastor), and &quot;The Leon Show&quot; on The Church Channel. Plans were also announced for Fontaine to become a regular host on &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; and four episodes per-year to originate from Canada, and for Miracle Channel and TBN co-produce a new weekly program.

In December 2023, TBN announced a distribution partnership with Phil McGraw&#x27;s new venture Merit Street Media.

=== Digital television ===
The signals of TBN&#x27;s television stations are multiplexed into digital subchannels, most of which carry networks owned by TBN. Subchannel lineups vary, but as of January 2025, most stations use the one below.
* x.1: TBN – flagship network
* x.2: Merit Street – news, reality, true crime, discussion
* x.3: TBN Inspire – programming similar to TBN&#x27;s, but focused more on church services
* x.4: OnTV4U – paid programming
* x.5: Positiv – Christian and family-friendly films; network owned by TBN

A small number of stations broadcast TBN&#x27;s Spanish-language Enlace network.

==Programming==

===Overview===
TBN produces a variety of original Christian programs, such as gospel music concerts, live coverage of major Christian events, talk shows, health/fitness/nutrition programs with Christian family doctors, children&#x27;s programs, contemporary Christian music videos, marriage enrichment series, holiday specials, Christian dramas, and full-length, family-oriented movies. In addition, the network airs local religious programming on each of their feeds.

The network&#x27;s flagship program &quot;Praise&quot; is hosted by various regular and guest hosts, including TBN president Matt Crouch and his wife Laurie Crouch. It features interviews with celebrities, ministers, and laypeople discussing faith-based topics and their personal relationship with God; as well as musical performances from gospel and contemporary Christian artists. The program originated as &quot;Praise the Lord&quot;, was regularly hosted by TBN founders Paul and Jan Crouch, and was originally two or three hours long. Until 2017, local versions of &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; were produced by TBN owned-and-operated stations and affiliates in order to fulfill public affairs content guidelines.

====Children&#x27;s programming====
TBN runs &quot;VeggieTales&quot; under the &quot;Smile&quot; banner on Saturdays 810 a.m Eastern Time to fulfill E/I programming requirements as per the FCC&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Television Act. Programs previously featured as part of the lineup, which are also broadcast on TBN&#x27;s Smile network, ranged from contemporary programs (such as &quot;3-2-1 Penguins!&quot;), classic series (such as &quot;Davey and Goliath&quot;), and TBN originals (such as &quot;iShine Knect&quot; and &quot;Mary Rice Hopkins &amp; Puppets with a Heart&quot;).

====Movies====
Since 2009, TBN has broadcast feature-length religious- and/or inspirational-themed films; these films air primarily on weekend evenings (with films based on biblical stories most commonly airing on Sundays), with more contemporary films – which often incorporate moral lessons, faith-based lessons or a combination thereof, and are commonly targeted at youth audiences – airing on Saturday nights as part of the network&#x27;s &quot;preview&quot; block of JUCE TV programs and intermittently on Monday through Fridays during the late-afternoon and overnight hours.

Films produced by or for TBN have included &quot;The Revolutionary&quot; and &quot;The Revolutionary II&quot; (based on the life of Jesus); &quot;The Emissary&quot; (a film on the life of the apostle Paul); &quot;The Omega Code&quot; and its sequel &quot;&quot;; &quot;Carman: The Champion&quot;; &quot;Time Changer&quot;; and &quot;Six: The Mark Unleashed&quot; (starring Stephen Baldwin and David A.R. White). Some of these films were produced by Gener8Xion Entertainment, TBN&#x27;s Hollywood, California-based Christian motion picture studio, which was co-founded by Matt and Laurie Crouch.

TBN also broadcasts films from other production companies on its main network and some of its sister networks (in particular, JUCE TV and Smile of a Child TV in the U.S.). One notable film was Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, which had its television premiere on TBN on April 17, 2011. TBN presented the film with much of the graphic violence included (due to its depiction of the events leading to and including the crucifixion of Jesus Christ as illustrated in Biblical teachings); as a result, TBN assigned a &quot;TV-MA-V&quot; rating for the film – a rarity for many Christian networks.

==TBN HD==

On December 15, 2009, the Trinity Broadcasting Network became the first Christian television network to broadcast completely in high definition. However, until 2018 only the national cable-satellite feed was transmitted in HD; TBN&#x27;s owned-and-operated broadcast stations were not equipped to allow HD broadcasts due partly to the bandwidth limitations caused by its mandatory carriage of five subchannels over a single broadcast signal and the lack of a modern multiplexer at the transmitter level, disallowing TBN&#x27;s master control from sending the main feed in high definition or widescreen standard definition (this is in comparison to Ion Media Networks, which carries five to six multiplex services on most of its stations – including its flagship network Ion Television, which is transmitted in high-definition); the primary TBN network feed is transmitted in standard-definition by its owned-and-operated stations and affiliates. Thus, widescreen programming on TBN&#x27;s broadcast services was offered over-the-air in a letterboxed 4:3 picture format, though it is offered in native formats on pay television and IPTV services (including TBN&#x27;s mobile and digital media player apps, the latter requiring email authentication and an opt-in to the network&#x27;s mailing list as of June 2018). At some point in 2018, some TBN over-the-air stations upgraded their primary feed and second subchannel to 720p HD, where available and/or technically possible.

==Charitable and humanitarian initiatives==

===Smile of a Child Foundation===
The Smile of a Child Foundation is a compassion-focused ministry, founded in 2005 by TBN co-founder Jan Crouch initially as a vehicle to reach the children of Haiti, providing food, medical care, toys and disaster relief to people in need. Crouch has over 20 years of personal involvement with the island country, having established a children&#x27;s hospital, an orphanage and a school in Haiti. TBN spent millions in donations and other funding on these humanitarian projects.

Following the January 12, 2010, Haiti earthquake, TBN made immediate contributions of $100,000 through Lake Charles, Louisiana-based Friend Ships, which speeds emergency relief aid and medical expertise all over the world in its fleet of dedicated cargo/ministry ships. Friend Ships has been partnering with TBN and Smile since 1992; Paul Crouch personally donated a Bell 206 Jet Ranger helicopter to the humanitarian organization.

In May 2009, the United Nations officially recommended the Smile of a Child Foundation to receive special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council for the Democracy Coalition Project.

==Attractions==

=== Trinity Music City ===
Trinity Music City is an entertainment complex in Hendersonville, Tennessee; near Nashville, operated by TBN and serving as the studios for TBN&#x27;s Nashville-area station, WPGD-TV. Formerly known as &quot;Twitty City&quot;, the former estate of country music legend Conway Twitty, the complex includes the 2,000-seat Trinity Music City Church Auditorium, which is used for TBN-produced concerts, dramas, seminars and special events. A 50-seat virtual reality theater showcases four original productions from TBN Films.

=== Trinity Christian City International ===
Trinity Christian City International was a complex in Costa Mesa, California, which served as the headquarters for TBN as well as a tourist attraction. On March 3, 2017, it was announced by The Christian media network that Trinity Christian City International had been sold to Greenlaw Partners, because TBN now finds its campus &quot;obsolete&quot;. A sales price was not disclosed. On April 12, 2017, it was revealed that the sales price was $18.25 million.

=== Holy Land Experience ===

In June 2007, TBN purchased the bible-themed adventure park Holy Land Experience in Orlando, Florida, for $37 million.

==Controversies==

===Theology===
Trinity Broadcasting Network had previously come under heavy criticism for its promotion of the prosperity gospel, teaching viewers that they will receive a reward if they donate or give offerings. In a 2004 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Paul Crouch, Jr. expressed his disappointment that &quot;the prosperity gospel is a lightning rod for the Body of Christ. It&#x27;s not what drives TBN.&quot; Under leadership of Matt Crouch, TBN no longer adheres to or practices that theology, and programming changes such as removing Kenneth Copeland reflect that shift.

TBN has always broadcast programming featuring Protestant pastors who do not promote the prosperity gospel, such as Charles Stanley, Jack Graham, Franklin Graham, Billy Graham, Michael Youssef, David Jeremiah and Robert Jeffress. Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Finance, has conducted investigations into whether Joyce Meyer and Benny Hinn mishandled their finances; neither were found to have committed wrongdoing.

Scholar Steve Snow states that TBN &quot;regularly promotes the teachings of the [New Apostolic Reformation]&quot;, which he argues &quot;represents what Richard Hofstadter referred to as the modern paranoid style in American politics&quot;.

===Wealth and transparency===
TBN is a 501(c)(3) non-profit company. Full disclosure of TBN&#x27;s financial statements have been evaluated by Charity Navigator, the largest evaluator of charities and non-profit companies in the U.S. TBN has received a three out of four star rating for four consecutive years, and in 2009 earned a rating of two out of four stars due to a 2% increase in administrative costs in 2009; the report also revealed that for the fiscal year ending December 2009, TBN president Paul Crouch, Sr. earned $419,500; co-vice president Jan Crouch earned $361,000; and co-vice president Paul Crouch, Jr. earned $214,137. TBN is currently under Donor Advisory status with Charity Navigator.

Another charity watchdog group, Ministry Watch, gave TBN an &quot;F&quot; in 2011 for its failure to provide financial statements, lack of timeliness in responding to correspondence, and its lack of clarity in the provided information. As a result, TBN was placed on the group&#x27;s alert list annually since 2009.

TBN&#x27;s annual financial information is monitored by the Chronicle of Philanthropy, where it is ranked 243 out of the top 400 non-profit corporations in the United States. TBN is not a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability.

In 2011, Paul Crouch, Jr. resigned from his position as co-vice president on TBN. On November 10 of that year, Crouch, Jr. joined The Word Network as its Director of Project Development.

In February 2012, Brittany Koper, TBN&#x27;s former Director of Finance (and the daughter of Paul Crouch Jr.), filed a lawsuit against her former attorneys, Davert &amp; Loe. The three counts of the complaint were for breach of fiduciary duties, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and professional negligence. In this lawsuit, Koper alleged that TBN unlawfully distributed over $50 million to the ministry&#x27;s directors. Koper filed the suit following the termination of her employment with TBN. Davert &amp; Loe, who also represented TBN, denied her claims. Koper&#x27;s suit against Davert &amp; Loe is pending; no official judicial ruling has been made in this matter. In a May 2012 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Koper claimed, &quot;My job as finance director was to find ways to label extravagant personal spending as ministry expenses.&quot; Koper alleged that the network had herself and chauffeurs and sound engineers ordained as ministers in order to avoid paying Social Security taxes on their salaries.

===Lawsuits===
In September 2004, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Paul Crouch had paid former TBN employee Enoch Lonnie Ford a $425,000 formal settlement to end a wrongful termination lawsuit in 1998. Ford alleged that he and Crouch had a homosexual tryst during his employment with the ministry. TBN officials acknowledged the settlement but contested Ford&#x27;s credibility, noting that he had previously been convicted for child molestation and drug abuse. In 1996, Ford was fired by TBN after he was arrested for drug-related offenses and returned to prison for a year. Ford allegedly threatened to sue TBN for wrongful termination and sexual harassment after the network refused to hire him following his release, resulting in his claims against Crouch. TBN officials stated that the settlement was made in order to avoid a lengthy and expensive lawsuit.

In late 2003, Ford attempted to extort Crouch, threatening to release an autobiographical manuscript of their alleged affair if TBN did not purchase the document for $10 million. In October 2004, Judge Robert J. O&#x27;Neill awarded Crouch $136,000 in legal fees to be paid by Ford for his violation of the terms of the settlement agreement, specifically the prohibition of discussing the details of the settlement. On March 15, 2005, Ford appeared on the PAX TV reality series &quot;Lie Detector&quot; to be given a polygraph test; the results of the test were never broadcast or made public.

In June 2012, the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; reported that Carra Crouch, a granddaughter of Paul and Jan Crouch, alleged in a lawsuit that she had been raped by a TBN employee when she was 13 years old. Carra claimed to have been sexually abused while staying at an Atlanta hotel during TBN&#x27;s &quot;Spring Praise-a-Thon&quot; in 2006. She also claimed that Jan Crouch and TBN attorney John Casoria blamed her for the incident, yet agreed not to turn the fired employee in to authorities if he did not file for unemployment, worker&#x27;s comp or EEOC benefits. TBN attorney Colby May &quot;vehemently denied&quot; Carra&#x27;s claims. In 2017, a year after Jan Crouch&#x27;s death, a jury awarded Carra $2 million in damages for &quot;mental suffering&quot;, but found that Jan had not been acting as a &quot;Trinity Clergy Member&quot; and therefore wasn&#x27;t legally required to report the assault.

===Pre-emption of programs due to criticism of other religions===
Bible prophecy scholar Hal Lindsey&#x27;s program &quot;International Intelligence Briefing&quot;, which occasionally aired commentary segments criticizing Muslims and Islam, aired on TBN from 1994 to 2005. In December 2005, TBN pre-empted the program for the entire month. Lindsey accused the network of censorship, saying, &quot;some at the network apparently feel that my message is too pro-Israel and too anti-Muslim.&quot; Paul Crouch issued a press release stating that the show was only pre-empted for Christmas programming, but eventually admitted that TBN management was concerned that Lindsey &quot;placed Arabs in a negative light.&quot; Lindsey resigned from TBN on January 1, 2006, effectively canceling &quot;International Intelligence Briefing&quot;. However, one year later, Crouch and Lindsey reconciled and a new program, &quot;The Hal Lindsey Report&quot;, premiered on the network.

In June 2011, TBN refused to rebroadcast an episode of Jack Van Impe&#x27;s weekly program &quot;Jack Van Impe Presents&quot;, in which the evangelist criticized pastors Rick Warren and Robert Schuller for participating in interfaith conferences alongside Muslim leaders. Both Warren and Schuller denied the accusations. Paul Crouch defended TBN&#x27;s decision, stating that it was against network policy for personalities to attack each other on-air (Schuller had a regular show on TBN). As a result, Jack Van Impe Ministries announced that it would no longer air Van Impe&#x27;s program on TBN.

===&quot;Travel the Road&quot; in Afghanistan===
TBN produces and airs the Christian reality show &quot;Travel the Road&quot;, which features missionaries Tim Scott and Will Decker in remote and often war-torn locations. In December 2008, the program attracted criticism from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF), a watchdog group that looks for religious discrimination in the United States military, which claimed that Scott and Decker were embedded with U.S. troops stationed in Afghanistan. According to MRFF president Mikey Weinstein, the military exercises a &quot;complete prohibition of the proselytizing of any religion, faith, or practice...You see [Scott and Decker] wearing American helmets. It is obvious they were completely embedded.&quot; When ABC News contacted the U.S. Army in Afghanistan about Scott and Decker&#x27;s alleged embed, which had taken place four years previously, they said that they no longer had the documentation of the missionaries&#x27; status with the troops.

Scott defended the trip to Afghanistan, telling ABC, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t like we were hiding in the back saying we&#x27;re going to preach. [The military] knew what we were doing. We told them that we were born again Christians, we&#x27;re here doing ministry, we shoot for this TV station and we want to embed and see what it was like. We were interviewing the chaplains and we talked to them. We spoke at the services and things like that. So we did do our mission being over there as far as being able to document what the soldiers go through, what it&#x27;s like in Afghanistan. So I could say that we were on a secular mission as well as far as documenting. I would say we were news reporters as well, we were delivering news of what was actually happening there, but we were also there to document the Christian side.&quot; Scott argued that since the pair were acting as Christian journalists, they had the same right to cover the war in Afghanistan as secular networks.

<text>John Rolfe ( – March 1622) was an English explorer, farmer and merchant. He is best known for being the husband of Pocahontas and the first settler in the colony of Virginia to successfully cultivate a tobacco crop for export.

He played a crucial role in the Virginia Colony&#x27;s early economy by introducing a sweeter strain of tobacco from Trinidad, which became a profitable cash crop. Rolfe married Pocahontas, daughter of Native American leader Powhatan, and they had a son named Thomas. Rolfe and Pocahontas traveled to England in 1616 to promote colonization and investment in Virginia. After Pocahontas died, Rolfe returned to Virginia and continued working with tobacco. The tobacco strain cultivated by Rolfe laid the foundation for Virginia&#x27;s thriving tobacco industry.

==Early life==

The birthplace of John Rolfe, born c. 1585, remains unproven. At that time, the Spanish Empire held a virtual monopoly on the lucrative tobacco trade. Most Spanish colonies in the Americas were located in South America and the West Indies, which were more favorable to tobacco growth than their English counterparts (founded in the early 17th century, notably Jamestown in 1607). As the consumption of tobacco had increased, the balance of trade between England and Spain began to be seriously affected. Rolfe was one of a number of businessmen who saw the opportunity to undercut Spanish imports by growing tobacco in England&#x27;s new colony in Virginia. He had somehow obtained seeds to take with him from a special popular strain, then being grown in Trinidad, South America, even though Spain had declared a penalty of death to anyone selling such seeds to a non-Spaniard.

At one point in time it was believed that John was the son of John Rolfe and his wife Dorothy Mason. However, historians have now determined that this relationship is incorrect. One major inconsistency that shows they are not his parents is that John is known to have had a brother named Henry. After John&#x27;s death, his brother Henry Rolfe petitioned the Virginia Company for funds from John&#x27;s Virginia estate, to help pay for the care of John&#x27;s son Thomas Rolfe who was then in Henry&#x27;s care. Dorothy Mason and her husband John Rolfe are not known to have had a son named Henry.{William Thorndale, &quot;Two Rolfe Negatives,&quot; in The Virginia Genealogist, 34(1990):209-210}

===Sailing with Third Supply to Virginia===
A project of the proprietary Virginia Company of London, Jamestown had been established by an initial group of settlers on 14 May 1607. This colony proved as troubled as earlier English settlements. Two return trips with supplies by Christopher Newport arrived in 1608, while another large relief fleet was dispatched in 1609, carrying hundreds of new settlers and supplies across the Atlantic. Heading the Third Supply fleet was the new flagship of the Virginia Company, the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, carrying Rolfe and his wife, Sarah.

The Third Supply fleet left England in May 1609 destined for Jamestown with seven large ships, towing two smaller pinnaces. In the southern region of the North Atlantic, they encountered a three-day-long storm, thought to have been a severe hurricane. The ships of the fleet became separated. The &quot;Sea Venture&quot; was taking on water faster than it could be bailed. The admiral of the company, Sir George Somers, took the helm and the ship was deliberately driven onto the reefs of Bermuda to prevent its foundering. All aboard, 150 passengers and crew, and one dog, survived.

Most remained for ten months in Bermuda, (also known as The Somers Isles), while they built two small ships to continue the voyage to Jamestown. A number of passengers and crew, however, did not complete this journey. Some had died or been killed, lost at sea (the &quot;Sea Venture&#x27;s&quot; long boat had been fitted with a sail, and several men sent to take word to Jamestown, and they were never heard from again), or left behind to maintain England&#x27;s claim to Bermuda. Because of this, although the Virginia Company&#x27;s charter was not extended to Bermuda until 1612, the Colony at Bermuda dates its settlement from 1609. Among those left buried in Bermuda were Bermuda Rolfe, the daughter of John.

In May 1610, the two newly constructed ships set sail from Bermuda, with 142 castaways on board, including Rolfe, George Somers, Stephen Hopkins, and Sir Thomas Gates. On arrival at Jamestown, they found the Virginia Colony almost destroyed by famine and disease during what has become known as the Starving Time. Very few supplies from the Third Supply had arrived because the same hurricane that caught the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; badly affected the rest of the fleet. Only 60 settlers remained alive. It was only through the arrival of the two small ships from Bermuda, and the arrival of another relief fleet commanded by Lord De La Warr on 10 June 1610, that the abandonment of Jamestown was avoided and the colony survived. After finally settling in Rolfe began his long-delayed work with tobacco.

===Orinoco tobacco: a cash crop===

In competing with Spain for European markets, there was another problem beside the warmer climates the Spanish settlements enjoyed. The native tobacco from Virginia (&quot;Nicotiana rustica&quot;) was not liked by the English settlers, nor did it appeal to the market in England. However, Rolfe wanted to introduce sweeter strains from Trinidad, using the hard-to-obtain Spanish seeds he brought with him. In 1611, he was the first to commercially cultivate &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot; tobacco plants in North America; export of this sweeter tobacco beginning in 1612 helped turn the Virginia Colony into a profitable venture. He named his Virginia-grown strain of the tobacco &quot;Orinoco&quot;, possibly in honour of tobacco popularizer Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s expeditions in the 1580s up the Orinoco River in Guiana in search of the legendary City of Gold, El Dorado. The appeal of Orinoco tobacco was in its nicotine, and the conviviality of its use in social situations.

In 1612, Rolfe established Varina Farms, a plantation along the James River about upstream from Jamestown and across the river from Sir Thomas Dale&#x27;s progressive development at Henricus. The first harvest of four barrels of tobacco leaf was exported from Virginia to England in March 1614. Soon afterwards, Rolfe and others were exporting vast quantities of the new cash crop. New plantations began growing along the James River, where export shipments could use wharves along the river.

Rolfe married Pocahontas, daughter of the local Native American leader Powhatan, on 5 April 1614. Earlier that same year, Pocahontas chose to convert to Christianity; she was baptized by Alexander Whitaker and chose &quot;Rebecca&quot; as her new baptismal name. Richard Buck officiated their wedding. Their son, Thomas Rolfe, was born in January 1615.

John Rolfe and Pocahontas continued cultivating tobacco with success. In 1616 they were sent to England as guests of the Virginia Company to promote colonization and investment in Virginia. They were accompanied by baby Thomas as well as by the deputy governor of the colony, Sir Thomas Dale, and 12 members of Pocahontas&#x27; tribe, including her brother-in-law Uttamatomakkin. They sailed aboard the &quot;Treasurer&quot;, commanded by Captain Samuel Argall, and arrived in England in June 1616. They helped promote the colony and investment in the Virginia Company increased. During their visit, John Rolfe wrote &quot;A True Relation of the State of Virginia Lefte by Sir Thomas Dale Knight in May Last 1616&quot; The manuscript was published in 1617 and further touted the viability of the colony in Virginia. After nine months in England, the party prepared to return to Virginia but was delayed by bad weather. Finally setting sail in March 1617, the party had to make port in Gravesend because Pocahontas was gravely ill. Pocahontas died and was buried at St George&#x27;s Church, Gravesend on 21 March 1617. Their small son Thomas was sick as well, it was determined he was too ill to survive a voyage. Pressured to return to Virginia, John Rolfe appointed Sir Lewis Stukley as temporary guardian to his son and returned to Virginia with Uttamatomakkin. Stukley had custody of Thomas Rolfe until his uncle Henry Rolfe could take over his care. It was intended that Thomas would return to Virginia once he recovered his health. Unfortunately, John Rolfe would never see his son again. Thomas did recover his health but remained in England until reaching adulthood.

===Later life, death, and descendants===

Rolfe returned to Virginia and resumed his work with tobacco. In 1617 20,000 pounds of Orinoco tobacco was sent to England and in 1618 an additional 40,000 pounds were sent. Rolfe&#x27;s letters to England in 1620 include the earliest mention of the first arrival of enslaved Africans to Virginia, who were brought by a Dutch man-of-war in August 1619 and were traded to the colony&#x27;s governor for supplies.

About 1619, Rolfe married Jane Pierce, daughter of English colonist Captain William Pierce, who had survived the shipwreck of the Sea Venture along with John in 1609. They had a daughter, Elizabeth, in 1620, who married John Milner of Nansemond, Virginia, and died in 1635. Rolfe died in 1622. He may have died in the Indian massacre of 1622, but the evidence is uncertain. His widow Jane later married English Captain Roger Smith.

The land given by Powhatan (now known as Smith&#x27;s Fort Plantation, located in Surry County) was willed to Thomas Rolfe, who in 1640 sold at least a portion of it to Thomas Warren. Smith&#x27;s Fort was a secondary Fort to Jamestown, begun in 1609 by John Smith.

Thomas Rolfe, who had grown up in England, returned to Virginia as an adult and married Jane Poythress. Poythress&#x27;s English parents were Francis Poythress and Alice Payton. Thomas and Jane Rolfe had one child, Jane Rolfe, who married Robert Bolling and had a son, John Bolling, in 1676. Jane Rolfe died shortly after giving birth. John Bolling married Mary Kennon, daughter of Richard Kennon and Elizabeth Worsham of Conjurer&#x27;s Neck. The couple had six surviving children, each of whom married and had surviving children.

== Popular culture ==
* In Disney&#x27;s 1998 animated film &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot;, Rolfe is voiced by Billy Zane.
* Rolfe is portrayed by Christian Bale in the 2005 film &quot;The New World&quot;.

==Legacy==

* The strain of tobacco cultivated by Rolfe was the export cash crop that helped make the Virginia Colony profitable. It was the mainstay of the farming plantations for generations. Huge warehouses, such as those on Richmond&#x27;s Tobacco Row, attest to its popularity. Even almost 400 years later, tobacco figures prominently in Virginia&#x27;s economy.
* In eastern Virginia, State Route 31 is named the John Rolfe Highway. It links Williamsburg with Jamestown, the southern entrance to the Colonial Parkway, and via the Jamestown Ferry leads to the rich farming area of Surry County and Sussex County, ending in Wakefield, Virginia.
* John Rolfe Drive, in the town of Smithfield in Isle of Wight County, Virginia, connects Battery Park Road with Magruder Road, and is named for Rolfe.
* John Rolfe Middle School, in Henrico County, Virginia, one of Virginia&#x27;s eight original shires of 1634, is named for him. Varina magisterial district in Henrico County is named for Rolfe&#x27;s Varina Farms plantation, where the tiny village was also the first county seat (from 1634 to 1752).
* The abandoned corridor planned for State Route 288 in western Henrico County became a connector street, rather than a limited-access highway. It was named the John Rolfe Parkway.

<doc id="348498" wikidata="Q5172576" url="?curid=348498" title="Corps of Discovery">
<text>The Corps of Discovery was a specially established unit of the United States Army which formed the nucleus of the Lewis and Clark Expedition that took place between May 1804 and September 1806. The Corps was led jointly by Captain Meriwether Lewis and Second Lieutenant William Clark. Commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson, the Corps&#x27; objectives were scientific and commercial – to study the area&#x27;s plants, animal life, and geography, and to learn how the Louisiana Purchase could be exploited economically. Aside from its military composition, the Corps&#x27; additional personnel included scouts, boatmen, and civilians.

On its two-year expedition through the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, the Corps encountered more than two dozen Native American tribes. Modern research now acknowledges that without such contact or help, the Corps of Discovery would have struggled to have completed their journey.

==History==
The foundations for the Corps of Discovery were laid when Thomas Jefferson met John Ledyard to discuss a proposed expedition to the Pacific Northwest in the 1780s. In 1802, Jefferson read Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s 1801 book about his 1792–1793 overland expedition across Canada to the Pacific Ocean; these exploratory journals influenced his decision to create an American body capable of reaching the Pacific as well. Two years after taking the presidency, Jefferson asked Congress to fund an expedition through the Louisiana Purchase.

In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the Corps of Discovery, and named as its leader his personal secretary and U.S. Army Captain, Meriwether Lewis, who selected William Clark as his partner. The goals of the Corps of Discovery, whose cadre would be raised primarily from the U.S. military, was to explore the Louisiana Purchase, and establish trade and U.S. sovereignty over the native peoples along the Missouri River. Jefferson also wanted to establish a U.S. claim to the Pacific Northwest and Oregon territory by documenting an American presence there before other European nations could lay title to the land.

The U.S. mint prepared special silver medals with a portrait of Jefferson and had a message of friendship and peace, called Indian Peace Medals or peace medals. The soldiers were to distribute them to the nations they met. But the Corps would be prepared for any acts of hostility because it would be equipped with the most advanced weapons available, such as rifles and a .46 caliber Girandoni Air Rifle. The Corps of Discovery was equipped with sufficient black powder and lead for their flintlock firearms, knives, blacksmithing supplies, and cartography equipment. They also carried flags, gift bundles, medicine and other items they would need for their journey. Much time went into ensuring a sufficient supply of these items.

To create the Corps of Discovery, and to ensure any chance of success, Lewis wanted to find the best possible men he could and recruit them to join his expedition. Men were expected to be excellent hunters and possess skills that would ensure their survival in the wilderness. He also wanted men who were brave, unmarried, and healthy. Lewis entrusted recruitment to Clark. He went to Louisville, Kentucky, where he found his first recruits, then Clarksville, Indiana. This group eventually became known as the &quot;Nine Young Men from Kentucky&quot;: William Bratton, John Colter, Joseph Field, Reubin Field, Charles Floyd, George Gibson, Nathaniel Pryor, George Shannon, and John Shields. In total almost a third of the party&#x27;s permanent members – forming the heart of the Corps – were from Louisville, Clarksville or their surrounding areas. Lewis conducted interviews and recruited at Fort Massac, and at the old French Mississippi River village of Kaskaskia. At Kaskaskia, he recruited the expedition&#x27;s chief non-commissioned officer, John Ordway.

A total of 33 volunteers, including 29 in training, spent the 1803–1804 winter at Camp Dubois in Indiana Territory. On May 14, 1804, the Corps left Dubois by canoe in order to meet up with Lewis at St. Charles, Missouri. The expedition then set off west following the Missouri River on 21 May. Three days later, they passed the French settlement of La Charrette, the westernmost Euro-American settlement on the Missouri.

The expedition followed the Missouri through what is now Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska. On August 20, 1804, Sergeant Charles Floyd died, supposedly by acute appendicitis. He would be the party&#x27;s only death on the expedition over the next two years. Floyd was buried at Floyd&#x27;s Bluff in what is now Sioux City, Iowa. During the coming weeks, the expedition would reach the Great Plains. They would be among a select group of white people to see the area abounding with elk, deer, bison, and beavers before the large-scale encroachment of European Americans.

Over the next two years, the Lewis and Clark Expedition established relations with more than two dozen indigenous nations between Missouri and the Pacific Ocean. Some researchers assert that without such contact or help, the Corps of Discovery would have undoubtedly starved to death or become hopelessly lost in the Rocky Mountains.

==Members of the Corps==

===Officers===
;Captain Meriwether Lewis
:Meriwether Lewis (1774–1809) was born in Ivy, Virginia. He joined the First American Regiment in 1794 and served in the Ohio Valley and the Northwest Territory, where he became friends with William Clark. In 1801, President Thomas Jefferson appointed Lewis as his private secretary. Two years later, Jefferson chose Lewis as commander of the expedition to cross the American continent to the Pacific Ocean. Following the return of the expedition in 1806, Lewis became governor of the Louisiana Territory. However political and personal problems caused him to suffer severe emotional difficulties. Lewis died at an inn on the Natchez Trace, Tennessee.

;Second Lieutenant William Clark
:William Clark (1770–1838) was born in Caroline County, Virginia. He was the younger brother of General George Rogers Clark. In 1792 he joined the army and served in the Northwest Indian War under General Anthony Wayne. In 1796 he resigned his commission to work in the family business. On accepting Lewis&#x27; offer to join the expedition, Clark received a second lieutenant&#x27;s commission instead of a captaincy because of the Army seniority system. However he and Lewis concealed this from the members of the expedition, who always referred to him as Captain Clark. After returning in 1806, Clark embarked on a distinguished political career, including the governorship of the Missouri Territory.

===Non-commissioned officers===
;Sergeant John Ordway
:John Ordway (1775–1817) was born in New Hampshire. He was the only expedition member who was a sergeant in the U.S. Army before the expedition. Ordway was recruited out of the 1st Infantry Regiment at Fort Kaskaskia. He was well educated and became the senior sergeant of the expedition. Ordway took care of the daily administration and, in the absence of the captain and lieutenant, was left in charge. Ordway was the only member of the Corps to keep a journal throughout the entire expedition. His accounts of Indian life are considered invaluable by modern scholars.

;Sergeant Charles Floyd
:Charles Floyd (1782–1804) was from Kentucky. He received his promotion to sergeant before the start of the expedition. He was the youngest member in the corps expedition who contracted Bilious Colic during their journey and did not recover, despite the corps efforts. Floyd died on August 20, 1804, near present-day Sioux City, Iowa, from what is now believed to have been ruptured appendix. He would be the only member of the Corps of Discovery who died on the journey. Floyd kept a journal until a few days before his death. Lewis regarded him as &quot;a young man of much merit&quot;. A large monument is located at his burial site.
;Sergeant Patrick Gass
:Patrick Gass (1771–1870) was born in Pennsylvania. He joined the U.S. Army in 1799 where he served in a volunteer Ranger unit. Gass was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia from a company of the 1st Infantry Regiment led by Captain Russell Bissell. His skill as a carpenter was of great value to the expedition. Gass was promoted from private to sergeant in August 1804 following the death of Sgt. Floyd. In 1807, Gass was the first to publish his journal. He stayed in the Army and served in the War of 1812 but was discharged after losing an eye in an accident. Gass was the last known survivor of the Lewis and Clark expedition.
;Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor
:Pryor (1772–1831) was born in Virginia. He was a widower and the cousin of Charles Floyd. Both Lewis and Clark considered him to be &quot;a man of character and ability&quot;. On return in 1806, the expedition helped him secure an officer&#x27;s commission in the U.S. Army. Pryor rose to the rank of captain and participated in the Battle of New Orleans in 1814. He later served as a government agent for the Osage Indians between 1830–31.
;Corporal Richard Warfington
:Warfington (b. 1777) was born in North Carolina. He was already a corporal in the 2nd Infantry Regiment when he volunteered to join the expedition. Warfington was considered to be a reliable and efficient NCO. When his enlistment expired during the expedition, Lewis and Clark asked him to stay and command the smaller mid-expedition return party to St. Louis in April 1805. Warfington accepted the command which included sending dispatches, journals, and specimens back to President Jefferson. He completed his mission so successfully he even managed to keep alive a prairie dog and four magpies. On the recommendation of Lewis, Warfington would receive a bonus beyond his regular pay.
;Corporal John Robertson
:John Robertson (b. 1780) was born in New Hampshire. He was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia from an artillery company. Although initially a corporal, Clark eventually demoted him to private after admonishing him for having &quot;no authority&quot; over his men and for failing to break up a fight at Camp Dubois. Robertson was most likely the first man to leave the expedition. On June 12, 1804, Pvt. Joseph Whitehouse recorded in his journal that a private &quot;belonging to Captain Stoddard&#x27;s company of Artillery&quot; was sent back to St. Louis with a trading party encountered coming down river. Presumably Robertson returned to his artillery company because there is no further record of him.

===Privates===
;Private John Boley
:John Boley was born in Pennsylvania. He was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia from the 1st Infantry Regiment. After Boley caused disciplinary problems at Camp Dubois, he was sent back with the return party in 1805. In the same year, he joined Zebulon Pike&#x27;s expedition which explored the upper Mississippi. Boley continued with Pike to the southwest and the Rockies in 1806.
;Private William Bratton
:William Bratton (1778–1841) was born in Kentucky. He was one of the first volunteers. Bratton served the expedition as a hunter, blacksmith, and gunsmith. In Spring 1806, he became incapacitated with a back ailment until an Indian sweat bath finally cured him. After the expedition, he served in the War of 1812.
;Private John Collins
:John Collins (d. 1823) was born in Maryland. He was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia from the 1st Infantry Regiment. Although he was a good hunter, he was often drunk and disobedient. He was court-martialed and received 100 lashes for stealing whiskey from the official supply when supposedly guarding it.
;Private John Colter
:John Colter (1775–1813) was born in Kentucky. During the expedition he proved himself to be an excellent hunter and woodsman. On the return trip to St Louis in 1806, he received permission from the two captains to leave the expedition so he could join a trapping party heading back up the Missouri River. While escaping an attack by Blackfoot Indians, Colter became the first European white man to see the region of steam vents and boiling mud pots nicknamed &quot;Colter&#x27;s Hell&quot;: the future site of Yellowstone National Park.
;Private Pierre Cruzatte
:Pierre Cruzatte was half French and Omaha Indian. He was both a master boatman and fiddle player. Blind in one eye and nearsighted in the other, Cruzatte accidentally shot Lewis while the two were hunting in August 1806. Lewis later paid tribute to Cruzatte&#x27;s experience as a riverman and to his integrity. His fiddle playing often entertained the Corps of Discovery and the Native Americans who they encountered.
;Private John Dame 
:John Dame (b. 1784) was born in New Hampshire. He was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia from an artillery company from the Regiment of Artillery led by Captain Amos Stoddard. Dame is mentioned only once in Clark&#x27;s journal. He was a member of the party that returned to St Louis in 1805.
;Private Joseph Field
:Joseph Field (1772–1807) was born in Kentucky. Like his brother, Reubin, they were considered to be among the best shots and hunters in the Corps of Discovery. Along with his brother and George Drouillard, they often accompanied the captains on special reconnaissance missions. Both brothers were present with Lewis in the fight with the Blackfeet on July 27, 1806.
;Private Reubin Field
:Reubin Field (1772–1823) was born in Kentucky. He fatally stabbed a Blackfoot through the heart during the fight on July 27, 1806.
;Private Robert Frazer
:Robert Frazer (d. 1837) was born in Virginia. No information survives on when Frazer joined the expedition or if he had previously been in the U.S. Army. When the party left St Louis in 1805, he was not part of the Corps of Discovery. Frazer only became part of the Corps on October 8, 1804, after Moses Reed was expelled. He kept a journal and received special permission from the captains to publish. But the publication never took place and the journal is apparently lost. However, Frazer&#x27;s map of the expedition has survived.
;Private George Gibson
:George Gibson (d. 1809) was from Kentucky. He was a good hunter and on occasion played the fiddle for the Corps of Discovery. He served as an interpreter with Native Americans using sign language.
;Private Silas Goodrich
:Silas Goodrich was from Massachusetts. It is unclear whether he had any prior military experience. He was one of the finest fishermen of the Corps of Discovery. After the expedition, Goodrich re-enlisted in the U.S. Army.
;Private Hugh Hall
:Hugh Hall (b. 1772) was born in Massachusetts. He was recruited at Fort Southwest Point from a company of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. Hall was court-martialed and flogged along with Collins for stealing from the official whiskey ration and getting drunk.
;Private Thomas Howard
:Thomas Howard (b. 1779) was from Massachusetts. He too was recruited from the 2nd Infantry Regiment at Fort Southwest Point. Howard would become the last member of the Corps to be court-martialed. A Native American had followed his example when he climbed over the walls at Fort Mandan after the gate had been closed. He was found guilty of &quot;pernicious example&quot; to the Indians, by showing them that the fort wall was scalable.
;Private François Labiche.
:François Labiche was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia. As an enlisted member of the Corps like Cruzatte, he was not hired as a civilian boatman. Labiche was an experienced boatman and Indian trader. He also spoke English, French, and several Indian languages. Lewis was so impressed with his interpreter skills, he recommended him for a bonus. Later Labiche accompanied Lewis to Washington to interpret for the Native American chiefs who went to meet President Jefferson.
;Private John Baptiste Lepage
:John Lepage was a French-Canadian fur trader who was recruited at Fort Mandan in 1805.
;Private Hugh McNeal
:Hugh McNeal was from Pennsylvania. He may or may not have been in the Army prior to joining the Corps on April 1, 1804. A man with the same name was on the Army rolls as late as 1811.
;Private John Newman
:John Newman (1785–1838) was born in Pennsylvania. He was recruited at Fort Massac from a company of the 1st Infantry Regiment. Newman was expelled from the expedition following his court-martial for &quot;having uttered repeated expressions of a highly criminal and mutinous nature&quot;. He remained with the expedition doing hard labor until sent back with the return party to St. Louis in April 1805.
;Private John Potts
:John Potts (1776–1808) was from Germany. Before joining the U.S. Army he had been a miller. Potts was recruited at South West Point from a company of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. Following the expedition in 1806, he joined St. Louis businessman Manuel Lisa on a fur-trading venture to the upper Missouri. In 1808 he and his friend John Colter were ambushed by Blackfeet near Three Forks, Montana on the Missouri River. Potts was killed and Colter narrowly escaped.
;Private Moses Reed
:Moses Reed&#x27;s origin and background are largely unknown. In August 1804, he attempted to desert the Corp but was apprehended, court-martialed, and expelled from the expedition. However he remained with the expedition as a boatsman until being sent back with the return party to St. Louis in April 1805.
;Private George Shannon
:George Shannon (1785–1836) from Pennsylvania was the youngest member of the Corps of Discovery. He joined Lewis at Maysville, Kentucky. During the Fall of 1804, he was lost for more than two weeks and nearly starved to death. After the expedition, Shannon became a lawyer and later served as a senator from Missouri.
;Private John Shields
:John Shields (1769–1809) was from Virginia. He was also the oldest member of the Corps of Discovery and one of the few who were married. Throughout the expedition, Shields&#x27; skills as a blacksmith, gunsmith, and carpenter were highly appreciated. &quot;Nothing was more peculiarly useful to us, in various situations,&quot; wrote Lewis, &quot;than the skill of this man as an artist, in repairing our guns, accoutrements, &amp;c.&quot; In 1806, Lewis recommended that Congress give Shields a bonus for his services.
;Private John Thompson
:Very little information is known about John Thompson, other than Clark praising him as &quot;a valuable member of our party&quot;. He may have been a surveyor before joining the expedition.
;Private Ebenezer Tuttle
:Ebenezer Tuttle (b. 1773) was born in Connecticut. He was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia from the Regiment of Artillery. Tuttle was a member of the return party to St Louis in April 1805. The only mention of him in Clark&#x27;s journals is in a Detachment Order of May 26, 1804.
;Private Peter Weiser
:Peter Weiser (b. 1781) was from Pennsylvania. He was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia from the 1st Infantry Regiment. Weiser was related to the notable frontier diplomat Conrad Weiser. After the expedition he joined Manuel Lisa&#x27;s fur-trading venture up the Missouri.
;Private William Werner
:Scant information is known about William Werner. Records show he had a fight with John Potts at Camp Dubois and was also convicted of being AWOL at St. Charles, Missouri. Other than these incidents, the journals reveal little about him.
;Private Isaac White
:Isaac White (b. 1774) was from Massachusetts. He was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia from its artillery company. White was a member of the return party to St. Louis in April 1805. The only mention of him in the journals is in a Detachment Order of May 26, 1804.
;Private Joseph Whitehouse
:Joseph Whitehouse (b. 1775) was from Virginia / Kentucky. He was recruited at Fort Massac from the 1st Infantry Regiment. Whitehouse was initially expelled from the Corps for deserting but was allowed to return after repenting. He kept a journal and often acted as a tailor for the other men. Whitehouse later served during the War of 1812 but deserted from the U.S. Army in 1817.
;Private Alexander Willard
:Alexander Willard (1778–1865) was born in New Hampshire. He was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia from the artillery company. Willard worked with Shields as a blacksmith for the Corps, but after he was convicted of sleeping while on guard duty (a crime punishable by death), he was given 100 lashes and sent back with the return party in April 1805. Willard later served during the War of 1812.
;Private Richard Windsor
:Only a small amount of information is known about Richard Windsor. He was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia from the 1st Infantry Regiment. During the expedition he served the Corps an experienced woodsman and productive hunter.

==Attached party==

===Permanent ===
;Toussaint Charbonneau and Sacagawea
:Charbonneau was either sold or given Sacagawea, who was born around 1788, near Lemhi, Idaho. The daughter of a Shoshone chief, she was kidnapped by the Hidatsa and sold into slavery to the Mandan, who passed her on to Charbonneau, who made her his wife. On February 11, 1805, she gave birth to a son named John Baptiste. Lewis described Charbonneau as a man &quot;of no particular merit&quot;, while both captains acknowledged the indispensable service Sacagawea provided the Corps of Discovery. As Clark wrote, &quot;a woman with a party of men is a token of peace&quot;.
;George Drouillard
:Drouillard (d. 1810) was from Canada. The son of a French-Canadian and a Shawnee mother, Drouillard first met Lewis at Fort Massac. Captain Daniel Bissell was probably employing Drouillard when Lewis recruited him for the expedition. Drouillard was known for his general skill as a scout, woodsman, and interpreter. He was one of the best hunters of the expedition and often conducted special missions for Lewis and Clark. After the expedition, Drouillard became a partner in Manuel Lisa&#x27;s fur-trading ventures on the upper Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers.
;York
:York (b. 1770) was a slave from Virginia who had been Clark&#x27;s companion from childhood. In 1799 Clark legally inherited York. Journals indicated he was large, strong, and perhaps overweight. He carried a rifle during the expedition and performed his full share of duties like the other members of the Corps of Discovery. After the expedition, York asked Clark for his freedom but Clark refused. He then asked if he could live and work in Louisville and send money back to Clark. York wanted to do this to be near his wife, who was enslaved by another man. Clark said no to this too. Clark wrote to his brother about this request and his denial of it. He stated: &quot;“[I will] permit [York] to Stay a fiew weeks with his wife ... [but] he is Serviceable to me at this place, and I am determined not ... to gratify him, and have directed him to return,” Clark (whose spelling was abysmal) wrote in an 1808 letter to his brother. “If any attempt is made by York to run off, or refuse to proform his duty as a Slave, I wish him Sent to New Orleands and sold, or hired out to Some Sevare Master until he thinks better of Such Conduct.”
;Seaman (dog)
:A newfoundland dog that Lewis purchased in Pittsburgh while waiting for the completion of boats for the expedition, Seaman made the entire trip with the Corps.

===&quot;Engagés&quot; (contract boatmen)===
;E. Cann
:Cann (1775–1836) was born Alexander Carson but had lived among the French for so long he was thought of as French. Cann returned to St. Louis with Corporal Warfington in April 1805.
;Charles Caugee
:Caugee was one of the original nine boatmen hired by the Corps.
;Joseph Collin
:Collin is mentioned in the journal of Sgt. Gass who described him as &quot;a young man who formerly belonged to the North West Company&quot;. It appears he accompanied the corps only as far as the Arikara Indian villages and was still living there when Lewis and Clark passed through again on their return in 1806.
;Jean-Baptiste Deschamps
:Deschamps was a private in the U.S. Army at Fort Kaskaskia who was recruited to be the foreman of the French contract boatmen. He returned to St. Louis with Corporal Warfington in 1805.
;Charles Herbert
:Herbert was married to Julie Hebert Dit La Croix in 1792. He had 11 baptized children. Herbert was enlisted by Lewis before the Corps left Camp Dubois. He was voluntarily discharged at the Mandan village in the winter of 1804.
;Jean-Baptiste La Jeunesse
:La Jeunesse, who was enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army, served as a boatman with the expedition. Although there is no record of his service or discharge from the military, he may have remained at the Mandan village when the expedition continued west in April 1805 or returned to St. Louis with Corporal Warfington.
;La Liberté
:La Liberté, who was also known as Joseph Barter, was a private in the U.S. Army at Fort Kaskaskia before he was assigned duties as a boatman. However, he deserted soon afterwards and did not accompany the expedition westward when it departed Camp Dubois in May 1804.
;Étienne Malboeuf
:Malboeuf (b. 1775) was recruited at Fort Kaskaskia as a contract boatman. His sister was married to Jean Baptiste La Jeunesse.
;Peter (Pierre) Pinaut
:Pinaut (b. 1776) was the son of a French-Canadian trader and a Missouri Indian woman. He is listed as a member of the corps as of May 1804. He probably returned to St. Louis in 1805.
;Paul Primeau
:Primeau was hired as a boatman at Fort Kaskaskia and listed as a member of the corps in May 1804. It is unclear if he returned to St. Louis with Corporal Warfington or remained on the upper Missouri.
;François Rivet
:Rivet (1757–1852) was hired at Fort Kaskaskia in 1804 as a contract boatman. Rivet, along with three other boatmen (Deschamps, Malboeuf, and Carson) remained at the Mandan village over the winter after they were discharged from the expedition. Rivet had originally departed with Corporal Warfington, but returned to the Mandan village and was living there when Lewis and Clark passed through on their way east in 1806.
;Peter Roi
:Due to the commonality of the family name of Roi (usually spelled Roy) among the French living in and around St. Louis in the early 19th century, surviving records give little information.

<text>Papantla () is a city and municipality located in the north of the Mexican state of Veracruz, in the Sierra Papanteca range and on the Gulf of Mexico. The city was founded in the 13th century by the Totonacs and has dominated the Totonacapan region of the state since then. The region is famed for vanilla, which occurs naturally in this region, the Danza de los Voladores and the El Tajín archeological site, which was named a World Heritage Site. Papantla still has strong communities of Totonacs who maintain the culture and language. The city contains a number of large scale murals and sculptures done by native artist Teodoro Cano García, which honor the Totonac culture. The name Papantla is from Nahuatl and most often interpreted to mean &quot;place of the papanes&quot; (a species of crow). This meaning is reflected in the municipality&#x27;s coat of arms.

==History==

The area in which Papantla is found has been dominated by a number of pre-Hispanic cultures. The first known is that of the Olmec, with the Huastecs coming afterward. Evidence of these cultures can be found at nearby archeological sites such as Cempoala, El Tajin, San Lorenzo and Tres Zapotes. The settlement was founded around 1200, by various groups of Totonacs, some of whom migrated here after being pushed south by the Chichimecas and other groups coming from the fallen city of El Tajín. During the rest of the pre-Hispanic period the site belonged to the Pueblos del Totonacapan, dominated by Tuzapan, and paid tribute to the Aztec Empire.

Soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Spanish quickly realized the value of the vanilla bean, which is native to this area. The Totonac town was refounded as Papantla de Santa María de la Asunción with Spanish families moving in. Soon after, vanilla was being sent to European markets. It was made the seat of the region called Totonacapan, which encompassed the modern municipalities of Cazones, Coatzintla, Coyutla, Espinal, Coxquihui, Chumatlan, Filomeno Mata, Gutiérrez Zamora, Mecatlán, Poza Rica, Progreso de Zaragoza, Tecolutla, and Zozocolco de Hidalgo.
In 1785, the nearby ruins of the pre-Hispanic city of El Tajín were accidentally discovered by Spaniard Diego Ruiz, while he was looking for clandestine plantings of tobacco. This site became famous around the world soon after due to the writings of Alexander von Humboldt and others. During the Mexican War of Independence, Serafin Olarte and his guerrillas actively fought in the area from 1813 to 1820, until Olarte was captured by royalist forces and executed. The municipality was created in 1880 by decree. In 1910, the settlement gained city status with the name of Papantla de Hidalgo. The official name was changed to Papantla de Olarte, in honor of Serafin Olarte. As during the War of Independence, indigenous peoples of the area rebelled against the regime of Porfirio Díaz in the late 1890s, just prior to the Mexican Revolution. A number of clashes were also fought here during that war. During this period, land reforms led to significant conflicts over property rights, as Indigenous Totonac communities resisted the privatization of communal lands. Historian Elimilo Kouri argues in his book that these reforms benefited local elites and state officials, leading many indigenous people to organize legal and communal strategies to reclaim their lands. Some Indigenous leaders leveraged public land laws to contest poorly measured or unaccounted for properties, sparking further tensions with powerful land owners. These disputes deepened social inequality and led to resistance movements. The unrest surrounding land dispossession and the disconnect with the Diaz regime contributed to the revolutionary struggles that erupted during the 20th century. 

The late 19th century was a period of profound transformation for Papantla, as the Mexican government under Porfirio Díaz pushed for the privatization of communal lands, to promote modernization and increase tax revenues. This process, however, sparked fierce resistance from the Totonac people, who saw their ancestral lands being divided and sold to merchants and elites. As one group of dissidents wrote, &quot;We do not want the division to happen, because the water springs are not just anywhere, and people prefer to live near where they are found.&quot; The resulting conflicts, including the 1891 uprising, foreshadowed the broader social unrest that would erupt during the Mexican Revolution, as rural communities across Mexico fought for land reform and justice.

In 1922, the city of Papantla became the seat of the Diocese of Papantla when it was created from territories that had belonged to the Dioceses of Veracruz and Tampico.

One of the most famous people to come from Papantla is artist Teodoro Cano Garcia, who was a disciple of Diego Rivera. During much of the 20th century, this artist worked to promote Papantla&#x27;s native Totonac heritage. He is responsible for most of the sculptures and other public art works that can be seen in the town today. Some of these include the “Evolution of the Totonac Culture” mural on the side of the main church, the “History of Papantla” mural which is on the side of the Chapel of Cristo Rey and the Monumento del Volador, a giant statue which is on a hill in the center of the city.

The city was nominated to become a Pueblo Mágico in 2006. However, the process was temporarily suspended. Problems to be resolved included the large number of street peddlers, the need to bury telephone and electrical lines and the need to paint many of the houses in the historic center. In 2012, Papantla officially became a Pueblo Mágico.

==The city==

Papantla is the heart of the Totonacapan region. When the Spanish refounded the town, they laid it out in Spanish style with a central plaza surrounded by the most important buildings, such as the main church and the main government building. The Municipal Palace still faces the main plaza, marked by the classic-style pediment over the main entrance. This building contains two murals: one about the Totonacs by Teodoro Cano Garcia and the other by Xolotl Martinez Hurtado de Mendoza. The construction of the building dates from 1810 although it was destroyed by forces associated with Pancho Villa in 1915. The building was reconstructed in 1929, with remodeling done in 1979 and 1999. The plaza is officially named the Israel C. Téllez Park, which contains grass and a number of trees. In this plaza are weekend events such as the Danzón Fridays as well as live music on Saturday and cultural events on Sundays. On the underside of the kiosk is a mural by Teodoro Cano Garcia which depicts the indigenous concept of creation, as a world with four suns.

The Church of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción was constructed between 1570 and 1590 by the Franciscans. Originally, the church did not have a bell tower as the bell was located on the nearby hill which is now the located of the Monument al Volador. The bell tower was built in 1875, and the clock which is there was installed in 1895. The church is in the form of a Latin cross and has an entrance flanked by Roman style pilasters. Across from the main facade are the principal markets, called Hidalgo and Juarez. On the atrium wall is a sculpted mural by Teodoro Cano Garcia which depicts the evolution of Totonac culture superimposed on the body of the god Quetzalcoatl.
The city has a total of eleven murals on public buildings as well as private houses. The Fernando Gutierrez Barrios Auditorim has a high relief mural depicting sports in the Totonacapan region. The Chapel of Cristo Rey is located on Madero Street and is modeled after the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. It contains a mural by Cano about the history of the city of Papantla. In addition to the murals, the Monument to the Voladores is located on a hill in the center of the city. This hill also serves as a scenic lookout and contains a mural which narrates the ceremony from the cutting of the tree to the execution of the descent.

The city is home to the Universidad Pedagógica Veracruzana, as well as a number of museums. The Museo de la Ciudad is located on Pino Suárez Street and contains exhibits from the pre-Hispanic, colonial and post-Independence periods. The Museo de las Mascaras contains a collection of over 300 masks from Totonacapan and other parts of Mexico, located in the community of San Pablo. It was founded by Simon Gomez Atzin who collected masks and ceremonial dress for many years. The Teodoro Cano Garcia Museum contains works by this artist as well as some of his protégés. It also contains archeological pieces and elements of Totonac culture such as dress. Other museums include the Museos del Totonacapan and the Casa de Cultura&#x27;s permanent collection of paintings and sculpture.

Regional specialties include frijoles in alchuchut, tashuayahun and zacahuil.

==Celebrations and dances==
On December 7, there is a tradition called the &quot;Dia del Niño Perdido” (Day of the Lost Child). On this day, lighted candles are placed on doorjambs and windowsills. However, the major festival for this city is the feast of Corpus Christi, which features processions, and indigenous dances such as the tocotines, guaguas, negritos, Santiagueros and voladores. The first feast of Corpus Christi was celebrated in Papantla sometime between 1550 and 1560, sponsored by the encomendero of the area, Placido Perez. Until very recently, the celebration was strictly religious with processions and liturgy. In 1957, a more secular event called the Festival of Corpus Christi was added to run concurrently with the religious rites. In that year, a livestock, agriculture, industrial and cultural fair was added. In 1958, the celebration of “Juegos Florales” (flower arrangements) and the Festival Xanath began to distinguish the event from others in the area. The Xanath Festival was begun by Mariano Torres Carreño and Hector Ventura de Castro with the aim of presenting Totonac culture to the city and make the residents proud of their heritage. The festival has indigenous art exhibits, traditional dance, costumes and music. The dances are choreographed into a single spectacle which is reworked each year.

Like the rest of Mexico, Papantla celebrates Day of the Dead but has some local variations. “Ofrendas” (altars to the dead) can be set up on tables or on board which are suspended from the ceiling. The altar is called a pachau and the lack on one in the home can bring on social rejection for violating community norms. These are decorated with palm fronds, bananas, oranges, limes, anis and chocolate figures. Food stuffs include mole, candy, tamales, local breads and other regional specialties. A glass of water and “renio” (a type of local alcohol) are also placed. Day of the Dead celebrations begin on 31 October for those who had died of natural causes. On 1 November, the souls of deceased children (called Laqsq’at’an) are welcomed. Later on 1 November and 2 November the souls of adults are said to return. It is believed that the souls come in the form of insects to eat the meals laid out in offering. It is also believed that this food needs to be freshly prepared and hot. During the nights, groups of living children go house to house singing traditional songs.
For religious and secular events, two dances are definitive of Papantla. According to Totonac myth, the gods told men “Dance, and we shall observe.” The Danza de los Voladores is one of these events that was originally meant to please the gods. The ceremony involves five participants who climb a thirty-meter pole. Four of these tie ropes around their waists and wind the other end around the top of the pole in order to descend to the ground. Each rope is wound around the top of the pole thirteen times, which by four equal 52 and corresponds to the Mesoamerican ritual calendar. The fifth participant stays at the top of the pole, playing a flute and a small drum. The flute represents birdsong and the drum the voice of the gods. The four who descend or “flying men” represent the four cardinal directions. The flautist begins by honoring the east, from which life is believed to have originated. This dance or ceremony has been inscribed as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO
The Dance of the Guaguas (also spelled Huahuas) is mostly performed by Totonacs but also by some groups of Nahuas and Huastecs who live in this area. It is a variant of the Dance of the Quetzales. The dance represents a survival of beliefs based on agricultural and the solar year. One essential element of the dance is the construction of a wooden cross which turns in a vertical position, representing the basis of creation and the genesis of cosmic life. Dancers dress in red pants, which have been elaborately embroidered, white shirts and a decorated cloth that goes across the chest. But the most distinctive apparel is the headdress, which is a large circle of woven ribbons with loose ends hanging around down the back. The dance movements involve the stomping with the boots that dancers wear.

==Vanilla==
Papantla is the heart of Mexico&#x27;s vanilla-growing region, called Totonacapan and the spice has been grown and trade here since well into the pre-Hispanic period. According to legend, the Totonacs have lived and grown vanilla since they came to this area after the downfall of Teotihuacan. Initially, the Totonacs gathered vanilla from wild orchids in the forests, but by the late 18th century, they began cultivating it in small plots, incorporating the crop into their traditional agricultural systems. This shift allowed them to increase production and participate in the growing vanilla trade while maintaining their economic autonomy. The system that emerged from these communal land holdings is known as the condueñazgo, where each participant owned a share of the total plot of land and the profit produced therein. By the 19th century, Papantla had become Mexico’s leading vanilla-producing region, with much of its crop exported to Europe and later the United States. Unlike many other cash crops, vanilla did not require extensive land clearing or disrupt Totonac subsistence farming, instead providing an important supplementary income that was used for household needs, religious ceremonies, and community obligations. Further, vanilla&#x27;s unique growability in the region left the Paplanta lower class completely dependent on the crop, further antagonizing the tensions that rose from pushes for privatization that lead to a starker contrast between classes. 

The origin of the plant is said to have come from the death of two young lovers. The young woman, Tzacopantziza, was the daughter of a king named Tenitztli. She was so beautiful that her father consecrated her to the goddess Tonacayohua so that no mortal man may have her. However, a young prince by the name of Zkatan-Oxga, kidnapped her. This angered the gods and send a monster to terrify the people. The priests found the couple hiding in the mountains and decapitated them both. Where their blood spilled, a plant began to grow, which soon began to give the people their fragrant flowers and seed pods.

True vanilla comes from a seed pod of an orchid called &quot;Vanilla planifolia&quot;. This plant grows as a vine on host trees in this area, though the species ranges as far south as Brazil. The pods are green when harvested, and turn black when dried. In the Totonac language, vanilla is called Xanath and is used to make a liquor which is almost never seen outside of the Papantla area. These people have used vanilla for centuries as a flavoring, a perfume and as medicine. In the early colonial period, the Spanish quickly exported vanilla to Europe and a number of cultivators became wealthy. The name &quot;vanilla&quot; comes from the Spanish &quot;vainilla&quot; which means little seed pod. The growing of vanilla remained a monopoly in Mexico until the French began their vanilla endeavor on the island of Réunion. Here, the technique of hand pollination was developed that allowed the French to continue their cultivation of vanilla, thus giving them access to the vanilla demands of the European continent. Even though French vanilla did become a competitor, Papantla&#x27;s continued vanilla cultivation ultimately remained constant and never went out of business. The United States was also a major consumer of Papantla&#x27;s vanilla beans. After surpassing the French in consumption the United States was able to start setting the market prices instead of letting the cultivators in Papantla do that. That led to a dramatic decrease in vanilla prices resulting in strict land reform movements that left many farmers at risk of not making a profit while no longer holding on to their land, as new title owners began creating unfair agreements with the farmers. This eventually led to a spark that helped the lower class people start rebellion prior to the beginning of the Mexican Revolution. Today, Mexican production of vanilla trails behind production in parts of Africa and Asia. In spite of this, the Academy of Sciences and Gastronomic Arts in Paris in 1921 chose to pay homage to the Totonacs who discovered vanilla.

Outside of Papantla, real vanilla is difficult to find in Mexico because of its cost. Within the Papantla area, elaborate figures, such as animals are made with the pods. The Xanath Festival, which is held concurrently with Corpus Christi, also honors vanilla. In addition, Papantla holds a Vanilla Expo in December.

==The municipality==


The city of Papantla is the governing authority for over 337 other named communities which cover a territory of 1,458.5 km². About a third of the municipality&#x27;s population of 159,910 (2020) live in the city proper. The city and municipality still has strong communities of Totonacs, with about 25% of the municipality&#x27;s population speaking an indigenous language. The overwhelming majority identify themselves as Catholic but about ten percent are evangelical Christian. Papantla borders the municipalities of Cazones de Herrera, Tecolutla, Gutiérrez Zamora, Martínez de la Torre, Espinal, Coatzintla, Tihuatlán and Poza Rica as well the state of Puebla to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the east.
The municipality is located in the Sierra Papanteca, which is a series of low mountains with numerous valleys. The most notable peaks are the La Jarana, Pelón, El campanario, La Palma, De la Cruz, Del Jazmín, del Grillo, de Dolores and Del Clavel. Small rivers which feed into the Tecolutla, and Texistepec Rivers pass through here, such as the Tlahuanapa, Santa Agueda and the Poza Verde. The area is heavily forested with subtropical perennial foliage with trees such as the heliocarpus, laurel, cedar and ceiba. It contains 17 km of mostly virgin beaches. The coastline includes the Boquila Estuary, Playa Chichinit, Rancho Playa, Playa Olmo, Tenixtepec and Boca de Lima. Most of the animal life consists of small mammals such as rabbits, raccoons and coyotes along with various species of birds and snakes. The area is considered to be tropical rainforest with most rain falling between May and August. September and October are notable for the occasional hurricane.

About 75% of the municipality&#x27;s land is dedicated to agriculture and pasture, with about 47% of the municipality&#x27;s population dedicated to it, as well as crafts. Main crops include corn, beans, chili peppers and oranges. Livestock raised here includes cattle, pigs, sheep and horses. There is some logging done. There is some industry here, much of which is the packing and shipping of oranges. Tourism is becoming an important part of the economy, based on the area&#x27;s archeological sites, beaches and traditions, especially the Danza de los Voladores.

The El Tajín archeological zone was one of the major cities of ancient Mesoamerica which existed between 800 and 1150 C.E. It has an extension of 105,555 m² with 165 buildings and 17 ball courts. The main attraction is the Pyramid of the Niches. It also has a site museum. At the Tajin site every year is the Cumbre Tajin Festival which falls on the spring equinox. It celebrates Totonac heritage with concerts, conferences, food, cultural events workshops and more. Another archeological zone is Cuyuxquihui, which extends about thirty hectares. It contains various pre-Hispanic structures of which the military fort and the ceremonial center stand out. It is located about 37 km from the city.

There are also two ecological parks called Kiwíkgolo and Xanath.

<text>Àngel Guimerà i Jorge (; 6 May 1845 or 6 May 1847 or 1849 – 18 July 1924), usually known simply as Àngel Guimerà, was a Catalan Spanish playwright and poet. His work is known for bringing together under romantic aspects the main elements of realism. He is considered one of the principal representatives of the &quot;Renaixença&quot; movement, at the end of the nineteenth century.

== Life ==
He was born in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, to a Catalan father and a Canary Islander mother. At an early age, Guimerà&#x27;s family moved to Catalonia, where they settled at his father&#x27;s birthplace, El Vendrell.

Guimerà wrote a number of popular plays, which were translated into other languages and performed abroad, proving instrumental in the revival of Catalan language as a literary language (Renaixença) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By far, the most famous was his realistic drama &quot;Terra baixa&quot; (&quot;Lowlands&quot;, also translated as &quot;Martha of the Lowlands&quot;). Written in 1896, it quickly became an international sensation. The play was translated into 15 different languages and the Spanish translation was presented regularly for a period of thirty years by the theatre of throughout Spain and Latin America. In English, the play received three Broadway productions between 1903 and 1936.

In addition to being a popular stage play, &quot;Terra baixa&quot; was made into six films, including a silent film in the United States, entitled &quot;Martha of the Lowlands&quot; (1914) and Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s &quot;Tiefland&quot; (1954). Furthermore, it served as the source material for two operas: Eugen d&#x27;Albert&#x27;s German opera &quot;Tiefland&quot; (1903) and Fernand Le Borne&#x27;s &quot;La Catalane&quot; (French).

Guimerà was nominated twenty-three times for the Nobel Prize in Literature, though he never won. 

Guimerà had a number of close relationships with men. He lived for many years with journalist and politician Pere Aldavert i Martorell; on 14 February 1910 they granted each other legal powers for the other&#x27;s affairs before a notary. They were buried in the same tomb.
When Guimerà died in 1924, he was offered a state funeral in Barcelona of a proportion which had never been seen before and was buried at the Montjuïc Cemetery.

In his hometown of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is a theater built in his name (Teatro Guimerá).

==&quot;Terra baixa&quot;==
&quot;Terra baixa&quot; is the story of Marta, a poor girl from Barcelona, who finds herself the young lover to Sebastià, the most important landowner in the Catalan lowlands. Sebastià must marry a woman of prominence to keep his land and inheritance. To squelch gossip of his relationship with Marta but still keep her as his lover, Sebastià marries her off to the unsuspecting Manelic, a young shepherd from the Pyrenees, and sets the newly weds up in the house attached to the town&#x27;s mill. Marta finds herself torn between her old domineering lover and her new caring husband.

==&quot;La filla del mar&quot;==
Another well-known work by Guimerà is the play &quot;La filla del mar&quot; (The daughter of the sea, 1900), that recounts the story of Àgata (Agate).

Her name is that of a precious stone, in sharp contrast to the contempt in which she is held. Her uncertain origins, and the fact that she had been born &quot;among Moors&quot; renders her an object of hate, branded as a heretic.

One of the few people who does not exclude her is Baltasanet, who states that &quot;When we are born, we are all Moors.&quot; Àgata is perfectly conscious of the fact that she is considered a &quot;nobody&quot; and a &quot;nuisance&quot;. &quot;What evil have I done, that everyone despises me?&quot;, she asks. The discrimination she faces leads ultimately to her death.

Àgata feels attracted by the sea, which seems to be calling out to her, in the voices of her parents.

For her, there is a symbolic opposition between sea and earth, the latter being all about misery and tears, whereas the sea harbours peacefulness and truth. Drowning, for her, would be a return to the &#x27;amniotic fluid&#x27; of the sea from which she was born.

Like a sailor, she is strong, brave, and vital. At the same time she is sensitive, and when she finds in Pere Màrtir the affection she had desperately lacked, they are able to connect. She excuses his past as a ladies&#x27; man, but, overcome by jealousy, threatens him with death if he relapses.

The story of Àgata involves numerous literary allusions and archetypes, from mythological aquatic characters, to the legend of Sappho committing suicide by throwing herself from a cliff into the sea. Translated by Rudolf Lothar, the work was the basis of Eugen d&#x27;Albert&#x27;s 1912 opera .

== Tributes ==
The main theater of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the oldest on the Canary Islands, is called Teatro Guimerá after this playwright. On the facade of the Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes de Santa Cruz de Tenerife are a number of marble busts representing famous people from Tenerife, among them Guimerà.

Avenida Ángel Guimerá, where the theater is located, is also named after the playwright and poet, as this was the street on which he was born.

A seated bronze statue of Guimerà was made in Catalonia in 1920 by Josep Cardona i Furró (1878–1923). This original model was then expanded by Josep Maria Codina for Barcelona&#x27;s Plaça del Pi in 1983. Two replicas were made of this statue, one of which was gifted to the town of El Vendrell (in the province of Tarragona) in 1986. The other is located opposite the stated Teatro Guimerá in Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

He was also named adopted son of Barcelona in 1909.

<text>Charles Jones Soong (; October 17, 1861 – May 3, 1918), also known by his courtesy name Soong Yao-ju (), was a Chinese businessman who first achieved prominence as a publisher in Shanghai. His children became some of the most prominent politicians of Kuomintang China.

== Early life ==
Charlie Soong was born Han Jiao Zhun () into a Hainanese of Hakka ancestry family, in the western suburbs of Wenchang City in Hainan province, the son of Han Hung-i () on October 17, 1861. His mother is from Three Ghost Wang Clan in Henan, Province. 

At about the age of seventeen a childless maternal relative adopted him, changing his family name to Soong, and took him to Boston, Massachusetts where he owned a tea and silk shop. After working as an apprentice in the shop for a time, Soong ran away and signed up as a cabin boy in the U.S. Revenue Marine (the forerunner of the U.S. Coast Guard) on board the USS &quot;Albert Gallatin&quot; under the command of Captain Eric Gabrielson. After approximately a year of service, Gabrielson was transferred to Wilmington, North Carolina. Soong followed Gabrielson to North Carolina not long afterwards to work on the USS &quot;Schuyler Colfax&quot;. After arriving in Wilmington, Soong eventually converted to the Christian faith and was baptized as Charles Jones Soon. In later years he changed the spelling of the family name to Soong.

Soon after Soong&#x27;s arrival, the Fifth Street Methodist Church in Wilmington, led by the Rev. Thomas Ricaud, began making preparations to train and educate Soong for the purpose of sending him back to China to work as a Christian missionary. These plans included the Durham, North Carolina philanthropist, fellow Methodist, and tobacco magnate Julian S. Carr (of &quot;Bull Durham tobacco&quot; fame), who volunteered to serve as Soong&#x27;s benefactor and sponsor. Carr had been a great contributor to Trinity College (now Duke University), and was subsequently able to get his Chinese protégé into the school in 1880, even though he met none of the qualifications for entry to university. The prospect of having a native Chinese as a missionary in China thrilled some of the ministers there. They set him to mastering the English language and studying the Bible. One year later, Soong transferred to Vanderbilt University, from which he received a degree in theology in 1885. In 1886, he was sent to Shanghai on a Christian mission after spending almost half of his life to that point abroad.

==From missionary to revolutionary==
Soong&#x27;s career as a missionary proved to be a short one. In the late 1880s, Charlie had begun to tire of the mission and felt that he could do more for his people if he was not bound to the restrictions and methods that came with working for the church. When he founded his first businesses—a small printing establishment and in 1892 a publishing house, the Sino American Press (he would also later co-found The Commercial Press)—he seemingly found it appropriate to resign from preaching. Instead, another society required his time and loyalty. Around this time, Charlie had secretly been initiated into Shanghai, Shenzhen and Canton&#x27;s thriving revolutionary movement, more specifically an organization that went by the name of Hung P&#x27;ang, or the Red gang. This organization had its roots in the movements to reinstate the Ming dynasty in the latter part of the 17th century, but had since transformed into a republican revolutionary force.

In 1894, Charlie Soong made the arguably most important connection in his life when he met Sun Yat-sen at a Sunday service in a Methodist church in Shanghai. The two men were kindred spirits of sorts, sharing their Western education, Hakka ancestry, the Christian faith and a burning ambition and craving for change in China. Perhaps most importantly, they were both members of entwined anti-Qing triads. They quickly became good friends and Charlie started funding Sun&#x27;s campaigns. A political body was set up, and the plan was to connect the triads into a network of opposition. When their first uprising failed in 1895, Sun fled China, and would not come back until sixteen years later. Charlie had remained incognito during the resistance and deemed it safe to remain in Shanghai, as his name had not yet been connected to the failed coup. In the coming years, Charlie Soong funded Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s travels in search of support and major financial backing.

==The founding of the Soong family==
In the years leading up to the revolution in 1911, Charlie Soong started a family in Shanghai with his wife from there Ni Kwei-Tseng (倪桂珍 &quot;Ní Guìzhēn&quot;). The couple had their first child in 1888—a girl whom they named Soong Ai-ling. Their next daughter, Soong Ching-ling was born in 1893, followed by their first son, T. V. Soong (Soong Tse Ven), a year later. Their last daughter, Soong Mei-ling came in 1898 and was followed by the brothers T. L. Soong (Soong Tse Liang, 宋子良 &quot;Sòng Zǐliáng&quot;) and T. A. Soong (Soong Tse An, 宋子安 &quot;Sòng Zǐ&#x27;ān&quot;).

Charlie intended to send all of his children to be educated in the United States. Ai-ling, at the early age of thirteen, was the first to go, becoming a special student at Wesleyan College in Georgia. All three sisters attended Wesleyan, with Ching-ling and Mei-ling moving to Georgia in 1907. (Mei-ling left Wesleyan, however, and graduated from Wellesley College in Massachusetts.) Ai-Ling graduated in 1909, and moved back to China. Charlie installed her as Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s secretary, in charge of handling his correspondence and of decoding messages to him from the republicans. A few years later in 1911, Sun Yat-sen was successful in bringing about the Xinhai Revolution, and the Qing State fell to be replaced by the short-lived presidency of Sun Yat-sen.

In 1912, Ching-ling returned to China, just in time to see the republic collapse under the leadership of Yuan Shikai. The connection between Charlie Soong and Sun Yat-sen was now widely known, and Charlie felt that his family would not be safe in China. In 1913, they fled with Sun to Tokyo. They remained there until 1916, when Charlie deemed the situation in Shanghai to be safe enough to return.
==Dispute with Sun Yat-sen==
While in Tokyo, Soong Ai-ling had married H. H. Kung, a wealthy banker (and 75th generation descendant of Confucius), and it was no longer suitable for her to work as Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s secretary. Instead, Soong Ching-ling took the job in 1914 while in Tokyo. The relationship between Ching-ling and Sun soon turned romantic, and when Charlie Soong moved his family back to Shanghai in 1916, they secretly kept in touch. It was however problematic to pursue this relationship, as Sun was already married. Thus, Charlie was outraged when Ching-ling asked to go back to Japan to join Sun. When she then defied him and escaped on a boat to Tokyo in the middle of the night, it was enough for Charlie to break all ties with Sun and disown his daughter.

==Death==
Charlie Soong died on May 4, 1918. The cause was Bright&#x27;s disease, known today as chronic nephritis (a type of kidney disease). Neither Sun Yat-Sen nor the rest of the Kuomintang showed any public mourning, as the clash over Ching-Ling was still fresh in the public memory.

<text>Frederick Funston (November 9, 1865 – February 19, 1917), also known as Fighting Fred Funston, was a general in the United States Army, best known for his roles in the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War; he received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the latter conflict.

==Early life, education, and work==
Funston was born in 1865 in New Carlisle, Ohio, to Edward H. Funston and Anne Eliza &quot;Mitchell&quot; Funston. In 1867, his family moved to Allen County, Kansas. His father was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1884 and served five terms.

Funston was a slight individual who stood tall and weighed when he applied in 1886 to the United States Military Academy; he was rejected. Funston graduated from Iola High School in 1886. He attended the University of Kansas from 1886 to 1890. While there, he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and became friends with William Allen White, who became a writer and won a Pulitzer Prize. He worked as a trainman for the Santa Fe Railroad before becoming a reporter in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1890.

==Career==
After one year as a journalist, Funston moved into more scientific exploration, focusing primarily on botany. First serving as part of an exploring and surveying expedition in Death Valley, California. In 1891, he then traveled to Alaska to spend the next two years in work for the United States Department of Agriculture.

===Cuba===

He eventually joined the Cuban Liberation Army that was fighting for independence from Spain in 1896 after having been inspired to join following a rousing speech given by Gen. Daniel E. Sickles at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

After a bout of malaria, Funston&#x27;s weight dropped to an alarming 95 lb. The Cubans gave him a leave of absence. When Funston returned to the United States, he was commissioned as a colonel of the 20th Kansas Infantry Regiment in the United States Army on May 13, 1898, in the early days of the Spanish–American War. In the fall, he met Eda Blankart at a patriotic gathering, and after a brief courtship, they married on October 25, 1898. Within two weeks of the marriage, he had to depart for war, landing in the Philippines as part of the U.S. forces that would become engaged in the Philippine–American War.

===Philippines===
Funston was in command in various engagements with Filipino nationalists. In April 1899, he took a Filipino position at Calumpit by swimming the Bagbag River, then crossing the Pampanga River under heavy fire. For his bravery, Funston was soon promoted to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers and awarded the Medal of Honor on February 14, 1900.

Funston played the key role in planning and carrying out the capture of Filipino President Emilio Aguinaldo on March 23, 1901, at Palanan. The capture of Aguinaldo made Funston a national hero in the U.S., although the anti-imperialist movement criticized him when the details of Aguinaldo&#x27;s capture became known. Funston&#x27;s party, escorted by a company of Macabebe Scouts, had gained access to Aguinaldo&#x27;s camp by posing as prisoners. Funston&#x27;s mission to capture Aguinaldo brought him a Regular Army commission just as he was scheduled to be mustered out of the volunteer service and, at only 35 years old, Funston was appointed a brigadier general in the Regular Army in recognition of his capture of Aguinaldo. 

In 1902, Funston returned to the United States to increased public opposition to the Philippine–American War, and became the focus of a great deal of controversy. Mark Twain, a strong opponent of U.S. imperialism, published a sarcasm-filled denunciation of Funston&#x27;s mission and methods under the title &quot;A Defence of General Funston&quot; in the &quot;North American Review&quot;. Poet Ernest Crosby also wrote a satirical, anti-imperialist novel, &quot;Captain Jinks, Hero&quot;, that parodied the career of Funston.

Funston was considered a useful advocate for American expansionism; however, when he publicly made insulting remarks about anti-imperialist Republican Senator George Frisbie Hoar of Massachusetts, mocking his &quot;overheated conscience&quot; in Denver, just prior to a planned visit to Boston, the epicenter of the U.S. anti-imperialism movement, President Theodore Roosevelt denied his furlough request and ordered him to be silenced and officially reprimanded.

===United States and overseas again===
In 1906, Funston was commander of the Presidio of San Francisco when the 1906 San Francisco earthquake hit. He declared martial law, although he did not have the authority to do so, and martial law was never officially declared. Funston attempted to defend the city from the spread of fire, and directed the demolition of buildings using explosives to create firebreaks, but his orders often resulted in more fires. Funston gave orders to shoot all looters on sight; however, these orders resulted in numerous cases of innocent people being shot.

At the time, local officials praised Funston&#x27;s actions in the earthquake and fire emergency. Historians have since taken issue with some of his actions in the disaster. Specifically, they argue that he should not have used military forces in a peacetime emergency, but rather should have kept them in their barracks unable to help others during a time of disaster.

From December 1907 through March 1908, Funston was in charge of troops at the Goldfield mining center in Esmeralda County, Nevada, where the army put down a labor strike by the Industrial Workers of the World.

After two years as commandant of the Army Service School in Fort Leavenworth, Funston served three years as commander of the Department of Luzon in the Philippines. He was briefly shifted to the same role in the Hawaiian Department (April 3, 1913, to January 22, 1914).

Funston was active in the United States&#x27; conflict with Mexico in 1914 to 1916, as commanding general of the army&#x27;s Southern Department, being promoted to major general in November 1914. He was commander of Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, where he prodded Second Lieutenant Dwight Eisenhower into becoming the football coach for the Peacock Military Academy and later approved Eisenhower&#x27;s request of leave for his wedding. He occupied the city of Veracruz. He commanded all forces involved in the hunt for Pancho Villa, and provided security for the United States border with Mexico during the &quot;Bandit War&quot;.

===World War I and death===

Just prior to the American entry into World War I, in April 1917, President Woodrow Wilson had favored Funston to head any American Expeditionary Force (AEF) that would be sent overseas. Funston&#x27;s intense focus on his work led to health problems: first, with a case of indigestion in January 1917, followed a month later by a fatal heart attack at the age of 51 in San Antonio, Texas.

In the moments before his death, Funston was relaxing in the lobby of the St. Anthony Hotel in San Antonio, listening to an orchestra play &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; waltz. After commenting, &quot;How beautiful it all is,&quot; he collapsed from a massive heart attack and died. He was holding six-year-old Inez Harriett Silverberg in his arms.

Douglas MacArthur, then a major, had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to President Wilson and Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. As MacArthur explained in his memoirs, &quot;had the voice of doom spoken, the result could not have been different. The silence seemed like that of death itself. You could hear your own breathing.&quot;

Funston lay in state at both the Alamo and the City Hall Rotunda in San Francisco. The latter honor gave him the distinction of being the first person to be recognized with this tribute, with his subsequent burial taking place in San Francisco National Cemetery. After his death, the position of AEF commander went to Major General John J. Pershing, who, as commanding general of the Punitive Expedition in 1916, had been Funston&#x27;s subordinate. The Lake Merced military reservation (part of San Francisco&#x27;s coastal defenses) was renamed Fort Funston in his honor, while the training camp built in 1917 next to Fort Riley in Kansas (which became the second-largest World War I camp) was named Camp Funston. San Francisco&#x27;s Funston Park and Funston Avenue are named for him, as is Funston Avenue in his hometown of New Carlisle, Ohio, and Funston Avenue near Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio. In Hawaii, Funston Road at Schofield Barracks and Funston Road at Fort Shafter are named after him. Funston&#x27;s daughter, and his son and grandson, both of whom served in the United States Air Force, were later interred with him.

<doc id="348509" wikidata="Q1347174" url="?curid=348509" title="Lippmann plate">
<text>Lippmann process photography is an early color photography method and type of alternative process photography. It was invented by French scientist Gabriel Lippmann in 1891 and consists of first focusing an image onto a light-sensitive plate, placing the emulsion in contact with a mirror (originally liquid mercury) during the exposure to introduce interference, chemically developing the plate, inverting the plate and painting the glass black, and finally affixing a prism to the emulsion surface. The image is then viewed by illuminating the plate with light. This type of photography became known as interferential photography or interferometric colour photography and the results it produces are sometimes called direct photochromes, interference photochromes, or Lippmann photochromes (distinguished from the earlier so-called &quot;photochromes&quot; which were merely black-and-white photographs painted with color by hand). In French, the method is known as &quot;photographie interférentielle&quot; and the resulting images were originally exhibited as &quot;des vues lippmaniennes&quot;. Lippmann won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908 &quot;for his method of reproducing colours photographically based on the phenomenon of interference&quot;.

Images made with this method are created on a Lippmann plate: a clear glass plate (having no anti-halation backing), coated with an almost transparent (very low silver halide content) emulsion of extremely fine grains, typically 0.01 to 0.04 micrometres in diameter.
Consequently, Lippmann plates have an extremely high resolving power exceeding 400 lines/mm.

==Method==

In Lippmann&#x27;s method, a glass plate is coated with an ultra fine grain light-sensitive film (originally using the albumen process containing potassium bromide; later and primarily using silver halide gelatin), then dried, sensitized in the silver bath, washed, irrigated with cyanine solution, and dried again. The back of the film is then brought into optical contact with a reflective surface. This originally was done by mounting the plate in a specialized holder with pure mercury behind the film. When it is exposed in the camera through the glass side of the plate, the light rays which strike the transparent light-sensitive film are reflected back on themselves and, by interference, create standing waves. The standing waves cause exposure of the emulsion in diffraction patterns. The developed and fixated diffraction patterns constitute a Bragg condition in which diffuse, white light is scattered in a specular fashion and undergoes constructive interference in accordance to Bragg&#x27;s law. The result is an image having very similar colours as the original using a black and white photographic process.

For this method Lippmann won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908.

The colour image can only be viewed in the reflection of a diffuse light source from the plate, making the field of view limited, and therefore not easily copied with conventional techniques. The method was very insensitive with the emulsions of the time and it never came into general use. Another reason Lippmann&#x27;s process of colour photography did not succeed can be found in the invention of the autochrome plates by the Lumière brothers. A technique derived from the Lippmann technique has been proposed as a method of producing images which can easily be viewed, but not copied, for security purposes.

* A diffusion method for making silver bromide based holographic recording material was published.

==Durable data storage utility==
Because the photographs are so durable, researchers have reworked Lippmann plates for use in archival data storage to replace hard drives. Work began on the project after they were made aware data storage on the International Space Station requires daily maintenance because it can be damaged by cosmic rays and they recalled that silver halide would not be significantly affected by astroparticles (or even electromagnetic pulses from nuclear explosions). 150 standing-wave storage samples placed on the ISS during 2019 showed no signs of data degradation after exposure to cosmic rays for nine months.

<doc id="348517" wikidata="Q5238688" url="?curid=348517" title="Hong Kong Economic Times">
<text>The Hong Kong Economic Times (abbreviated as the HKET) is a financial daily newspaper in Hong Kong. It was founded by Lawrence S P Fung (; chairman), Perry Mak (managing director), Arthur Shek Kang-chuen (; executive director) and others. It started with a investment in 1988.

The newspaper is published by Hong Kong Economic Times Holdings Limited. It has been listed on the main board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong since 3 August 2005.
== Controversies ==
=== Founder&#x27;s suspected involvement in Yuen Long station riot ===
On 20 July 2019, at the pro-Beijing &quot;Safeguard HK&quot; event, &quot;HKET&quot; founder Arthur Chuen publicly called pro-Beijing supporters to purchase canes and PVC pipes to punish those who opposed the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill. The very next day, a mob with suspected ties to triads used canes and metal pipes launched an indiscriminate attack which injured 45 people at Yuen Long station. The public suspected that Chuen&#x27;s comments might have incited the pro-Beijing camp to launch this riot. On 22 July 2019, over 100 &quot;HKET&quot; reporters published a joint statement expressing shock and deep regret towards Chuen&#x27;s comments and requested him to withdraw his statement. &quot;HKET&quot; announced that Chuen&#x27;s comments were his personal opinion and did not represent the newspaper&#x27;s position. In the evening of the same day, Chuen apologized and withdrew his comment. The next day, Chuen announced to the &quot;HKET&quot; board of directors that he resigned as executive director and deputy president of the newspaper effective immediately, but that he would continue to serve as a financial columnist.

=== Plagiarism allegations ===
&quot;HKET&quot; subsidiaries &quot;Sky Post&quot; and &quot;TOP&quot;ick reporters were alleged to have plagiarized stories reported by other online media without permission. This included copying text word-for-word into &quot;HKET&quot; website and reproducing YouTube video contents in the form of text and screenshots in detail without attributing original sources.

<doc id="348535" wikidata="Q20098" url="?curid=348535" title="Tricorder">
<text>A tricorder is a fictional handheld sensor that exists in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. The tricorder is a multifunctional hand-held device that can perform environmental scans, data recording, and data analysis; hence the word &quot;tricorder&quot; to refer to the three functions of sensing, recording, and computing. In &quot;Star Trek&quot; stories the devices are issued by the fictional Starfleet organization.

The original physical prop for the tricorder was designed by Wah Chang and appeared in &quot;The Man Trap&quot; in 1966, the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode to air.

==Types==

The tricorder of the 23rd century, as seen in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, is a black, rectangular device with a top-mounted rotating hood, two opening compartments, and a shoulder strap. The top pivots open, exposing a small screen and control buttons. When closed it resembles a portable tape recorder.

Three main variants appear in shows. The standard tricorder is a general-purpose device used primarily to scout unfamiliar areas, make detailed examination of living things, and record and review technical data. The medical tricorder is used by doctors to help diagnose diseases and collect bodily information about a patient; the key difference between this and a standard tricorder is a detachable hand-held high-resolution scanner stored in a compartment of the tricorder when not in use. The engineering tricorder is fine-tuned for starship engineering purposes. There are also many other lesser-used varieties of special-use tricorders.

The ship&#x27;s medical variant employs a detachable &quot;sensor probe&quot; stored in the bottom compartment when not in use. The probe, although originally thought to have been fashioned from a spare salt shaker, was actually scratch-built for the show; the conical Danish salt shakers were set dressing, used as laser scalpels. The 24th-century version introduced in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; is a small, gray, hand-held model with a flip-out panel to allow for a larger screen. This design was later refined with a slightly more angular appearance that was seen in most &quot;Next Generation&quot;–era movies as well as later seasons of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot;. In the post-&quot;Next Generation&quot;-era (&quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Elite Force II&quot; ), a newer tricorder was introduced. It is flatter, with a small flap that opens on top and a large touchscreen interface.

==Production==
The tricorder prop for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series was designed and built by Wah Ming Chang, who created several futuristic props under contract. Some of his designs are considered to have been influential on later, real-world consumer electronics devices. For instance, his communicator inspired cell phone inventor Martin Cooper&#x27;s desire to create his own form of mobile communication device. Many other companies followed this example and life-sized replicas remain popular collectibles today.
The tricorder in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; was initially inspired by the HP-41C scientific calculator.

==&quot;Real&quot; tricorders==

Software exists to make hand-held devices simulate a tricorder. Examples include Jeff Jetton&#x27;s Tricorder for the PalmPilot; the Web application for the Pocket PC, iPhone, and iPod Touch; and an Android version.

Vital Technologies Corporation sold a portable device dubbed the &quot;Official Star-Trek Tricorder Mark 1&quot; (formally, the TR-107 Tricorder Mark 1) in 1996. Its features were an &quot;Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Meter&quot;, &quot;Two-Mode Weather Station&quot; (thermometer and barometer), &quot;Colorimeter&quot; (no wavelength given), &quot;Light meter&quot;, and &quot;Stardate Clock and Timer&quot; (a clock and timer). Spokespersons claimed the device was a &quot;serious scientific instrument&quot;. Vital Technologies marketed the TR-107 as a limited run of 10,000 units before going out of business, although far fewer than 10,000 were likely ever built. The company was permitted to call this device a &quot;tricorder&quot; because Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s contract included a clause allowing any company able to create functioning technology to use the name.

In February 2007, researchers from Purdue University publicly announced their portable (briefcase-sized) DESI-based mass spectrometer, the &quot;Mini-10&quot;, which can be used to analyze compounds in ambient conditions without prior sample preparation. This was also announced as a &quot;tricorder&quot;.

In March 2008, British biotech company QuantuMDx was founded to develop the world&#x27;s first handheld DNA lab, a molecular diagnostic point-of-care device which will provide disease diagnosis in under 15 minutes. In March 2014, the company launched a crowdfunding campaign to support clinical trials of the device and to name it. Contributors and members of the public called for the device to be officially named a &quot;Tricorder&quot;.

In May 2008, researchers from Georgia Tech publicly announced their portable hand-held multi-spectral imaging device, which aids in the assessment of the severity of an injury under the skin, including the detection of pressure ulcers, regardless of lighting conditions or skin pigmentation. The day after the announcement, technology websites, including Inside Tech and The Future of Things, began comparing this device to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; tricorder.

On May 10, 2011, the X Prize Foundation partnered with Qualcomm Incorporated to announce the Tricorder X Prize, a $10 million incentive to develop a mobile device that can diagnose patients as well as or better than a panel of board-certified physicians. On the contest was officially opened at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Early entrants to the competition include two Silicon Valley startups, Scanadu and Senstore, which began work on the medical tricorder in early 2011. Entries included ones from CloudDx and DMI, among others. The winner of the competition was Final Frontier Medical Devices, which is now known as Basil Leaf Technologies.

On August 23, 2011, moonblink&#x27;s tricorder app for Android was served with a copyright infringement notice by lawyers for CBS and it was deleted from the Android Market by Google. On January 5, 2012, it was put back again as a new app in the Android market, although it is no longer available.

In 2012, cognitive science researcher Dr. Peter Jansen announced having developed a handheld mobile computing device modeled after the design of the tricorder. A version that expanded the original capabilities to include visible spectroscopy, radiation sensing, thermal imaging, and environmental sensing was released as open source hardware in 2014.

On December 7, 2020, genomics researcher Dr. Michael Schatz and his intern Aspyn Palatnick published a paper on the first mobile app to allow anybody to study DNA virtually anywhere using an iPhone or iPad, which many media outlets dubbed to be a &quot;DNA tricorder.&quot;

On February 19, 2022, NASA sent the rHEALTH ONE, a universal biomedical analyzer, regarded as a comprehensive device capable of measuring most common lab tests for spaceflight medical conditions, to the International Space Station. This was successfully tested by ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti on May 13 and May 16, 2022. She successfully demonstrated the device&#x27;s ability to take a small drop of sample (&lt; 10 uL) and perform measurements on samples prepared by NASA for determining the performance of the device on-orbit. Over 100 million raw data points were recorded on five different detector channels using two lasers with a readout of minutes, making the rHEALTH ONE the most powerful biomedical analyzer ever tested in space.

==Toys and replicas==
The first mass-produced tricorder replica was featured in AMT&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; Exploration Set in 1974, followed shortly thereafter by a palm-sized version in Remco&#x27;s 1975 &quot;Star Trek&quot; Utility Belt which was sized and marketed to young children in hopes of taking advantage of &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; that was on TV at that time.

The first life-sized tricorder was produced by Mego Corporation in 1976 and was actually a cassette tape player made to look like a tricorder. In the 1990s, &quot;Star Trek&quot; replicas were mass-produced by Playmates, Playing Mantis, and Master Replicas, making commercially produced replicas affordable to the average fan for the first time. In the 2000s, Art Asylum and later Diamond Select produced prop replicas of the original tricorder.

<text>Ferrero Rocher ( , , ; stylized in all caps) is a brand of chocolate and hazelnut confection manufactured by the Italian company Ferrero. Michele Ferrero is credited as the product&#x27;s creator.

Each Ferrero Rocher ball is covered in foil and placed into a paper liner. The confection is machine made and much of its production process is kept secret.

It is sold worldwide and is particularly associated with Christmas. The brand is known in the United Kingdom, and other countries such as Mexico, by the popular 1990s &#x27;ambassadors&#x27; advertisement Ferrero Rocher: &quot;The Ambassador&#x27;s Party&quot; on YouTube.

== History ==
Ferrero Rocher was introduced in 1979 in Italy and in other parts of Europe in 1982. Michele Ferrero, the credited inventor, named the chocolate after a grotto in the Roman Catholic shrine of Lourdes, . &quot;Rocher&quot; comes from French and means &#x27;rock&#x27; or &#x27;boulder&#x27;.

== Ingredients ==
The chocolate consists of a whole roasted hazelnut encased in a thin wafer shell filled with hazelnut chocolate and covered in milk chocolate and chopped hazelnuts. Its ingredients are milk chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, skim milk powder, butteroil, lecithin as emulsifier (soy), vanillin (artificial flavor), hazelnuts, palm oil, wheat flour, whey (milk), low fat cocoa powder, sodium bicarbonate (leavening agent), and salt.

== Production ==
The production process is a secret, and no smartphones or notebooks are allowed inside the production facilities. As of 2015, few journalists have ever been invited to visit. As of 2015, the production in the Alba factory totals 24 million Ferrero Rochers a day.

The mechanised production process begins with flat sheets of wafer with hemispheres moving down an assembly line. The hemispheres of the wafers are then filled with a chocolate hazelnut cream and part of a hazelnut. Next, two of these wafer sheets—one with a hazelnut and one with hazelnut chocolate creme—are clamped together. The excess wafer is cut away, producing wafer balls. These are then coated with a layer of chocolate, a layer of chopped hazelnuts, and a final layer of milk chocolate before the chocolate ball is wrapped in gold-coloured foil.

== Distribution ==
Roughly 3.6 billion Ferrero Rochers are sold each year in over 42 countries. These include 28 countries in Europe including the UK, eight countries in Asia, five countries in Africa including South Africa, nine countries in the Americas, and two countries in Oceania.

==Cultural impact==
=== Christmas ===
Ferrero Rochers are associated with the holiday season during Christmas and New Year. As of 2015, 62% of Ferrero Rochers were sold within the last three months of the year.

=== 1990s UK advertisement ===
A United Kingdom advertisement in the 1990s was based upon a party in a European ambassador&#x27;s official residence, with the chocolates arranged into a pyramid and portrayed as a sophisticated treat. The advertisement has been repeatedly parodied in popular culture since. In 2000, the ambassador&#x27;s party commercial was ranked 21st in Channel 4&#x27;s poll of &quot;The 100 Greatest TV Ads&quot;.

=== Immigrant communities ===
Ferrero Rocher is popular among immigrant communities in the United States due to its relatively low price compared with other luxury goods, along with its upscale appearance and marketing. Before Ferrero Rocher was available in mainland China, it was a popular gift from people in Hong Kong, who nicknamed Rocher &quot;gold sand&quot;, to people on the mainland around Chinese New Year. 

=== Knockoffs and counterfeits ===
In 2017, police made several arrests and seized 300,000 pieces of counterfeit Rocher which had been produced in a factory in Wuhu. Ferrero had spent USD $1 million and five years fighting Chinese firm Montresor, whose &quot;Tresor Dore&quot; chocolates were priced at one-third of the cost of the genuine Rocher; an April 2008 court ruling had previously ordered Montresor to cease production.

<text>Geirr Tveitt (born Nils Tveit; 19 October 1908 – 1 February 1981) was a Norwegian composer and pianist. Tveitt was a central figure of the national movement in Norwegian cultural life during the 1930s.

==Life==

===Early years===
Tveitt was born in Bergen, where his father briefly worked as a teacher. His parents were Håkonson Lars Tveit (1878–1951) and Johanna Nilsdotter Heradstveit (1882–1966). His family were of farmer stock, and still retained &quot;Tveit&quot;, their ancestral land in Kvam – a secluded village on the scenic Hardangerfjord. The Tveit family would relocate to Drammen in the winter to work, but return to Hardanger in the summer to farm. Thus, Tveitt enjoyed both a countryside existence and city life. Tveitt had originally been christened Nils, but following his increasing interest in Norwegian heritage, he thought the name &#x27;not Norwegian enough&#x27; and changed it to Geir. He later added an extra &quot;r&quot; to his first name and an extra &quot;t&quot; to Tveit to indicate more clearly to non-Norwegians the desired pronunciation of his name. It was during his childhood summers in Hardanger that Tveitt gained knowledge of the rich folk-music traditions of the area. Historically, Hardanger&#x27;s relative isolation allowed for the development of a unique musical culture, with which Tveitt became infatuated. Tveitt was no child prodigy, but discovered that he possessed musical talent, and learned to play both the violin and the piano. And, after having been encouraged by Norwegian composer Christian Sinding, Tveitt decided to try his hand at writing music.

===Leipzig===
In 1928 Tveitt left Norway to be educated. He headed for Germany – to Leipzig and its Conservatory, which had been the hub of European musical learning and culture for so long. It was an intense time for Tveitt. He studied composition with Hermann Grabner and Leopold Wenninger, and the piano with Otto Weinreich, making extraordinary progress in both fields. The joy of learning from some of the best German educators of the time was often overshadowed by his almost chronic lack of funds – Tveitt having to rely upon translation work and donations to support himself. The Norwegian composer David Monrad Johansen through the student years. Perhaps it was the expatriation from Norway that kindled in Tveitt a strong desire to embrace completely his Norwegian heritage. Tveitt&#x27;s profound interest in the modal scales (which forms the basis of the folk-music of many countries) often tested Grabner&#x27;s patience. However, the latter must have felt great pride when Tveitt had his &quot;12 Two-part Inventions in Lydian, Dorian and Phrygian&quot; accepted for publishing by Breitkopf &amp; Hartel in 1930. The following year the Leipzig Radio Orchestra premiered Tveitt&#x27;s first Piano Concerto – a composition that reflects Tveitt&#x27;s search for an individual and Norwegian voice.

===European studies and touring===
In 1932 Tveitt headed on to Paris. Tveitt had become increasingly frustrated with the teaching in Leipzig, but found a new freedom &amp; inspiration. Here he obtained lessons from some of the greatest and most well-known composers of the times: Arthur Honegger and Heitor Villa-Lobos both agreed to see Tveitt. He further managed to enroll in the classes of Nadia Boulanger. Tveitt also made a visit to Vienna, where he was able to study for some time with Austrian composer Egon J. Wellesz, a former pupil of Arnold Schoenberg. Tveitt made one last educational stopover in Paris in 1938 before heading home to Norway to work. Compared to other Norwegian composers contemporary with Tveitt, he had perhaps the most diverse education – and he had already started to make a name for himself. His writings and compositions made quite a stir amongst the establishment in Oslo. In the years leading up to World War II, Tveitt derived most of his income working as music critic to &quot;Sjofartstidende&quot; (The Naval Times). Tveitt&#x27;s highly opinionated reviews contributed to his securing strong opponents – one of these were the Norwegian composer, Pauline Hall. Tveitt focused his energies on composing. As soon as the Second World War had ended, Tveitt brought his scores with him to Europe, touring extensively – often performing own piano works with similar works by other composers, i.e. Grieg and Chopin. Many of the concerts were great personal and artistic successes for the Norwegian composer, and especially so the 1947 concert in Paris. Here Tveitt premiered his &quot;Piano Sonatas nos 1 and 29&quot;, some of his adaptations of Hardanger Folk-Songs and also the Fourth Concerto for Piano and Orchestra – &quot;Aurora Borealis&quot;. The piano concerto was performed in a two-piano version, Tveitt assisted by the French pianist Genevieve Joy. According to reviews, the concerto had thrown the Parisian audience into a paroxysm of ecstasy. Tveitt&#x27;s intense, glittering, French-Impressionist flavoured rendition of the dancing and mystical northern winter sky, earned him the acclaim of his former teacher Nadia Boulanger in her following review.

===Later years and death===
In spite of Tveitt&#x27;s glorious successes internationally, the contemporary Norwegian establishment remained aloof. Following the upheaval of the Second World War, anything that resembled nationalism or purism was quickly disdained by the Establishment. Tveitt&#x27;s aesthetic and music were fundamentally unfashionable. Tveitt struggled financially and became increasingly isolated. He spent more and more time at the family farm in Kvam, keeping his music to himself – all manuscripts neatly filed in wooden chests. The catastrophe could therefore hardly have been any worse when his house burned to the ground in 1970. Tveitt despaired – the original manuscripts to almost 300 opuses (including six piano concertos and two concertos for Hardanger fiddle and orchestra) were reduced to singed bricks of paper – deformed and inseparable. The Norwegian Music Information Centre agreed to archive the remains, but the reality was that 4/5 of Tveitt&#x27;s production was gone. Tveitt now found it very difficult to compose and gradually succumbed to alcoholism. Several commentators imagine that his many hardships contributed to these conditions. Tveitt died in Norheimsund, Hardanger, reduced and largely embittered, with little hope for the legacy of his professional work.

===Controversy===
One of the most controversial areas of Tveitt&#x27;s career is his affiliation with the so-called Neo-Heathenistic movement, which centered around the Norwegian philosopher Hans S. Jacobsen (1901–1980) in the 1930s in Oslo. This is a topic that frequently returns in Norwegian public debate. Jacobsen&#x27;s main thesis, inspired by the theories of the German theologist Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, was the total refutation of Christianity in favour of a new heathen system based upon Norse mythology and the Edda poetry. The movement rejected Christianity and sought to re-introduce the Norse pre-Christian system of belief – the adoration of Odin, Thor and Balder. Jacobsen later became a member of &quot;Nasjonal Samling&quot; (&#x27;National Assembly&#x27;), which led the interim, pro-Hitler puppet government during the German occupation of Norway. Even though Geirr Tveitt displayed a deep interest in the theories of the movement, he never enrolled as a member of Nasjonal Samling. His preoccupation with Jacobsen&#x27;s thinking however, materialised in conspicuous ways; for example, Tveitt invented his own non-Christian timeline based upon the arrival of Leif Erikson in what is now Canada. Traces of Antisemitism are often found in his correspondence from the 1930s. The Neo-Heathen system of thought found its way into Tveitt&#x27;s music; his perhaps most intensely such composition is the ballet &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Dreams&quot;. In it, one could argue, Tveitt seeks to establish a link between this world – its creation, cycle and dwellers – and the eternal battle between the benevolent heathen Norse gods and their opponents, the evil jotuns. Tveitt began work on the ballet whilst studying in Leipzig, where it was first performed on 24 February 1938. There &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Dreams&quot; became a remarkable success, and performances were later given in Berlin, Tübingen, Bergen and Oslo.

Another result of Tveitt&#x27;s Norse purism was his development of the theory that the modal scales originally were Norwegian, renaming them in honor of Norse gods. He also developed an intricate diatonic theory, which interconnected the modal scales through a system of double leading notes. These ideas were published in his 1937 argument &quot;Tonalitätstheorie des parallellen Leittonsystems&quot;. Even though most musicologists agree that Tveitt&#x27;s theories are colored by his personal convictions – his thesis is intelligent, challenging and thought-provoking.

The issue of Tveitt&#x27;s inglorious relationship with so-called &#x27;nazi-ideologies&#x27; is so delicate that most scholars have avoided it altogether. Some commentators have noticed that one of the foremost Norwegian authorities on Tveitt, Hallgjerd Aksnes, Professor of Music at the University of Oslo, did not address this question in her article on Tveitt in Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Tveitt&#x27;s connection to far-right German thinking is perhaps a question scholars will return to as the world understands the dynamics of a troubled period in European history more fully. For Tveitt, the question proved devastating to his reputation, and contributed significantly to his becoming a &quot;persona-non-grata&quot; in the post-war musical establishment in Norway. However, as the most traumatic years of European history become more distant, a new generation of academics and musicians are approaching Tveitt and his music. Most of Tveitt&#x27;s remaining music is now commercially available on records.
==Music==

===Stylistic origins===
Geirr Tveitt&#x27;s compositions are characterized by their eclectic influences, drawing inspiration from a diverse range of musical styles and traditions. His works prominently feature the aggressive energy found in the early ballets of Igor Stravinsky, as well as the distinctive rhythms and textures reminiscent of Béla Bartók. Additionally, Tveitt&#x27;s music often incorporates the ethereal and mystic qualities of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, all the while rooted in motifs derived from Norwegian folk music. Unfortunately, a significant portion of Tveitt&#x27;s oeuvre has not been published or systematically archived, a situation that was further exacerbated by a fire in 1970. In an effort to salvage his works, Tveitt undertook visits to various universities across Norway and reached out to friends in search of any surviving copies or parts of his compositions, although these efforts yielded limited results. Over time, however, several of Tveitt&#x27;s scores have been rediscovered; some have been reconstructed from orchestral parts, as well as from radio broadcasts and magnetic tape recordings.

===Hardanger folk music===
Tveitt&#x27;s perhaps greatest musical project was the collection and adaptation of traditional folk melodies from the Hardanger district. Many composers and musicologists (including Norway&#x27;s internationally recognised Edvard Grieg) had successfully researched and collected the music of Hardanger long before Tveitt. However, from 1940 onwards, when Tveitt settled permanently in Hardanger, he became one of the locals, and spent much time working and playing with folk-musicians. He thus happened upon a treasure of unknown tunes, claiming to have discovered almost one thousand melodies, and incorporated one hundred of these into his work list; &quot;Fifty folktunes from Hardanger for piano&quot; op. 150, and &quot;A Hundred Hardanger Tunes&quot; op. 151. Musicologist David Gallagher might speak for many when he suggests that in these two opuses – their universe, music and history – are found the very best of Tveitt&#x27;s qualities as a composer. The tunes reflect both profound (in fact) Christian values and a parallel universe dominated by the mysticism of nature itself and not only the worldly, but also nether worldly creatures that inhabit it – according to traditional folklore. The major part of the tunes is directly concerned with Hardanger life, which Tveitt was a part of. In his adaptations, therefore, he sought to bring forth not only the melody itself, but also the atmosphere, mood and scenery in which it belonged. Tveitt utilised his profound knowledge of traditional and avant-garde use of harmony and instruments when he scored the tunes – achieving an individual and recognisable texture. Copies of the piano versions and orchestral suites nos 1, 2, 4 and 5 were elsewhere during that tragic fire in 1970, so these works survive. Norwegian musicologists hope that suite nos 3 and 6 might be restored from the burned-out remnants held at the archives in Oslo.

===Legacy in Norway===
Tveitt&#x27;s works remained largely misunderstood and unappreciated by his contemporary Norwegian musical establishment. However, Tveitt won the hearts of a whole nation with his radio programmes on folk music at the Norwegian National Broadcasting (NRK) in the 1960s and &#x27;70s. Tveitt worked as Assistant Producer to the radio, where he also premiered numerous songs written to texts by respected and well-known Norwegian poets like Knut Hamsun, Arnulf Overland, Aslaug Vaa and Herman Wildenvey. Many Norwegians remember perhaps Tveitt most fondly for his tune to Aslaug Låstad Lygre&#x27;s poem &quot;We should not sleep in summer nights&quot;. In 1980 Tveitt was awarded the Lindeman prize for the work he had done through the NRK. He also set songs by Aslaug Vaa and Olav H. Hauge.

Today Norway is seeing the advent of a new generation of musicians and musicologists, who seem to be primarily concerned with Tveitt&#x27;s music and not so much with the controversies he inspired. Starting in the late 1990s the Norwegian government began to provide some funding for the examination and preservation of the remains of Tveitt&#x27;s scores, and several startling discoveries have been made. Thought to have been lost for all time, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Dreams&quot; appeared amongst the damaged manuscripts, and its fate is illustrative. Tveitt made numerous versions of the ballet – in Paris he presented a reworked score &quot;Dances from Baldur&#x27;s Dreams&quot;. Tveitt then sent it to the choreographer Serge Lifar in London, where the score allegedly was lost in the Blitz.

However, after the singed manuscripts held at the NMIC were examined in 1999, it became apparent that Tveitt indeed had a copy of the 1938 original score – and through tedious restoration work by Norwegian composer Kaare Dyvik Husby and Russian composer Alexej Rybnikov from the singed manuscripts, recording, and a piano version, the ballet literally rose from the ashes. It is now available on BIS-CD-1337/1338, where Ole Kristian Ruud conducts the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra. A TV documentary program &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Dreams&quot; on the incredible fate of the ballet, was broadcast in Norway on 15 June 2008 and attracted nationwide interest.

Another reconstruction project worth mentioning is the reconstruction of the solo piano piece &quot;Morild&quot;. The title alludes to the mysterious phenomenon of phosphorescence of the sea, and it was amongst the treasures lost in the 1970 fire. Fortunately, a recording of the work made by Tveitt for French national radio in 1952 has survived. It was issued for the first time on Simax in 1994. A reconstruction of the score was undertaken by the American transcription specialist Chris Eric Jensen in 2005 in collaboration with the pianist Håvard Gimse who gave the piece its first performance on Tveitt&#x27;s 100th birthday on 19 October 2008, the first time it had been played by a pianist other than the composer.

<doc id="348560" wikidata="Q2296951" url="?curid=348560" title="Morse theory">
<text>In mathematics, specifically in differential topology, Morse theory enables one to analyze the topology of a manifold by studying differentiable functions on that manifold. According to the basic insights of Marston Morse, a typical differentiable function on a manifold will reflect the topology quite directly. Morse theory allows one to find CW structures and handle decompositions on manifolds and to obtain substantial information about their homology.

Before Morse, Arthur Cayley and James Clerk Maxwell had developed some of the ideas of Morse theory in the context of topography. Morse originally applied his theory to geodesics (critical points of the energy functional on the space of paths). These techniques were used in Raoul Bott&#x27;s proof of his periodicity theorem.

The analogue of Morse theory for complex manifolds is Picard–Lefschetz theory.

==Basic concepts==
To illustrate, consider a mountainous landscape surface formula_1 (more generally, a manifold). If formula_2 is the function formula_3 giving the elevation of each point, then the inverse image of a point in formula_4 is a contour line (more generally, a level set). Each connected component of a contour line is either a point, a simple closed curve, or a closed curve with double point(s). Contour lines may also have points of higher order (triple points, etc.), but these are unstable and may be removed by a slight deformation of the landscape. Double points in contour lines occur at saddle points, or passes, where the surrounding landscape curves up in one direction and down in the other.
Imagine flooding this landscape with water. When the water reaches elevation formula_5, the underwater surface is formula_6, the points with elevation formula_5 or below. Consider how the topology of this surface changes as the water rises. It appears unchanged except when formula_5 passes the height of a critical point, where the gradient of formula_2 is formula_10 (more generally, the Jacobian matrix acting as a linear map between tangent spaces does not have maximal rank). In other words, the topology of formula_11 does not change except when the water either (1) starts filling a basin, (2) covers a saddle (a mountain pass), or (3) submerges a peak.
To these three types of critical pointsbasins, passes, and peaks (i.e. minima, saddles, and maxima)one associates a number called the index, the number of independent directions in which formula_2 decreases from the point. More precisely, the index of a non-degenerate critical point formula_13 of formula_2 is the dimension of the largest subspace of the tangent space to formula_1 at formula_13 on which the Hessian of formula_2 is negative definite. The indices of basins, passes, and peaks are formula_18 and formula_19 respectively.

Considering a more general surface, let formula_1 be a torus oriented as in the picture, with formula_2 again taking a point to its height above the plane. One can again analyze how the topology of the underwater surface formula_11 changes as the water level formula_5 rises.

Starting from the bottom of the torus, let formula_24 and formula_25 be the four critical points of index formula_26 and formula_27 corresponding to the basin, two saddles, and peak, respectively. When formula_5 is less than formula_29 then formula_11 is the empty set. After formula_5 passes the level of formula_32 when formula_33 then formula_11 is a disk, which is homotopy equivalent to a point (a 0-cell) which has been &quot;attached&quot; to the empty set. Next, when formula_5 exceeds the level of formula_36 and formula_37 then formula_11 is a cylinder, and is homotopy equivalent to a disk with a 1-cell attached (image at left). Once formula_5 passes the level of formula_40 and formula_41 then formula_11 is a torus with a disk removed, which is homotopy equivalent to a cylinder with a 1-cell attached (image at right). Finally, when formula_5 is greater than the critical level of formula_44 formula_11 is a torus, i.e. a torus with a disk (a 2-cell) removed and re-attached.

This illustrates the following rule: the topology of formula_46 does not change except when formula_5 passes the height of a critical point; at this point, a formula_48-cell is attached to formula_46, where formula_48 is the index of the point. This does not address what happens when two critical points are at the same height, which can be resolved by a slight perturbation of formula_51 In the case of a landscape or a manifold embedded in Euclidean space, this perturbation might simply be tilting slightly, rotating the coordinate system.

One must take care to make the critical points non-degenerate. To see what can pose a problem, let formula_52 and let formula_53 Then formula_10 is a critical point of formula_55 but the topology of formula_46 does not change when formula_5 passes formula_58 The problem is that the second derivative is formula_59that is, the Hessian of formula_2 vanishes and the critical point is degenerate. This situation is unstable, since by slightly deforming formula_2 to formula_62, the degenerate critical point is either removed (formula_63) or breaks up into two non-degenerate critical points (formula_64).

==Formal development==
For a real-valued smooth function formula_65 on a differentiable manifold formula_66 the points where the differential of formula_2 vanishes are called critical points of formula_2 and their images under formula_2 are called critical values. If at a critical point formula_13 the matrix of second partial derivatives (the Hessian matrix) is non-singular, then formula_13 is called a &#x27;; if the Hessian is singular then formula_13 is a &#x27;.

For the functions
formula_73
from formula_74 to formula_75 formula_2 has a critical point at the origin if formula_77 which is non-degenerate if formula_78 (that is, formula_2 is of the form formula_80) and degenerate if formula_81 (that is, formula_2 is of the form formula_83). A less trivial example of a degenerate critical point is the origin of the monkey saddle.

The index of a non-degenerate critical point formula_13 of formula_2 is the dimension of the largest subspace of the tangent space to formula_1 at formula_13 on which the Hessian is negative definite. This corresponds to the intuitive notion that the index is the number of directions in which formula_2 decreases. The degeneracy and index of a critical point are independent of the choice of the local coordinate system used, as shown by Sylvester&#x27;s Law.

===Morse lemma===
Let formula_13 be a non-degenerate critical point of formula_90 Then there exists a chart formula_91 in a neighborhood formula_92 of formula_13 such that formula_94 for all formula_95 and
formula_96
throughout formula_97 Here formula_48 is equal to the index of formula_2 at formula_13. As a corollary of the Morse lemma, one sees that non-degenerate critical points are isolated. (Regarding an extension to the complex domain see Complex Morse Lemma. For a generalization, see Morse–Palais lemma).

=== Fundamental theorems ===
A smooth real-valued function on a manifold formula_1 is a Morse function if it has no degenerate critical points. A basic result of Morse theory says that almost all functions are Morse functions. Technically, the Morse functions form an open, dense subset of all smooth functions formula_102 in the formula_103 topology. This is sometimes expressed as &quot;a typical function is Morse&quot; or &quot;a generic function is Morse&quot;.

As indicated before, we are interested in the question of when the topology of formula_104 changes as formula_5 varies. Half of the answer to this question is given by the following theorem.

:Theorem. Suppose formula_2 is a smooth real-valued function on formula_66 formula_108 formula_109 is compact, and there are no critical values between formula_5 and formula_111 Then formula_11 is diffeomorphic to formula_113 and formula_114 deformation retracts onto formula_115 

It is also of interest to know how the topology of formula_11 changes when formula_5 passes a critical point. The following theorem answers that question.

:Theorem. Suppose formula_2 is a smooth real-valued function on formula_1 and formula_13 is a non-degenerate critical point of formula_2 of index formula_122 and that formula_123 Suppose formula_124 is compact and contains no critical points besides formula_125 Then formula_126 is homotopy equivalent to formula_127 with a formula_48-cell attached.

These results generalize and formalize the &#x27;rule&#x27; stated in the previous section.

Using the two previous results and the fact that there exists a Morse function on any differentiable manifold, one can prove that any differentiable manifold is a CW complex with an formula_129-cell for each critical point of index formula_130 To do this, one needs the technical fact that one can arrange to have a single critical point on each critical level, which is usually proven by using gradient-like vector fields to rearrange the critical points.

===Morse inequalities===
Morse theory can be used to prove some strong results on the homology of manifolds. The number of critical points of index formula_48 of formula_65 is equal to the number of formula_48 cells in the CW structure on formula_1 obtained from &quot;climbing&quot; formula_51 Using the fact that the alternating sum of the ranks of the homology groups of a topological space is equal to the alternating sum of the ranks of the chain groups from which the homology is computed, then by using the cellular chain groups (see cellular homology) it is clear that the Euler characteristic formula_136 is equal to the sum
formula_137
where formula_138 is the number of critical points of index formula_139 Also by cellular homology, the rank of the formula_129th homology group of a CW complex formula_1 is less than or equal to the number of formula_129-cells in formula_143 Therefore, the rank of the formula_48th homology group, that is, the Betti number formula_145, is less than or equal to the number of critical points of index formula_48 of a Morse function on formula_143 These facts can be strengthened to obtain the :
formula_148

In particular, for any
formula_149
one has
formula_150

This gives a powerful tool to study manifold topology. Suppose on a closed manifold there exists a Morse function formula_65 with precisely &quot;k&quot; critical points. In what way does the existence of the function formula_2 restrict formula_1? The case formula_154 was studied by Georges Reeb in 1952; the Reeb sphere theorem states that formula_1 is homeomorphic to a sphere formula_156 The case formula_157 is possible only in a small number of low dimensions, and &quot;M&quot; is homeomorphic to an Eells–Kuiper manifold.
In 1982 Edward Witten developed an analytic approach to the Morse inequalities by considering the de Rham complex for the perturbed operator 
formula_158

===Application to classification of closed 2-manifolds===
Morse theory has been used to classify closed 2-manifolds up to diffeomorphism. If formula_1 is oriented, then formula_1 is classified by its genus formula_161 and is diffeomorphic to a sphere with formula_161 handles: thus if formula_163 formula_1 is diffeomorphic to the 2-sphere; and if formula_165 formula_1 is diffeomorphic to the connected sum of formula_161 2-tori. If formula_168 is unorientable, it is classified by a number formula_169 and is diffeomorphic to the connected sum of formula_161 real projective spaces formula_171 In particular two closed 2-manifolds are homeomorphic if and only if they are diffeomorphic.

===Morse homology===
Morse homology is a particularly easy way to understand the homology of smooth manifolds. It is defined using a generic choice of Morse function and Riemannian metric. The basic theorem is that the resulting homology is an invariant of the manifold (that is, independent of the function and metric) and isomorphic to the singular homology of the manifold; this implies that the Morse and singular Betti numbers agree and gives an immediate proof of the Morse inequalities. An infinite dimensional analog of Morse homology in symplectic geometry is known as Floer homology.

==Morse–Bott theory==
The notion of a Morse function can be generalized to consider functions that have nondegenerate manifolds of critical points. A is a smooth function on a manifold whose critical set is a closed submanifold and whose Hessian is non-degenerate in the normal direction. (Equivalently, the kernel of the Hessian at a critical point equals the tangent space to the critical submanifold.) A Morse function is the special case where the critical manifolds are zero-dimensional (so the Hessian at critical points is non-degenerate in every direction, that is, has no kernel).

The index is most naturally thought of as a pair
formula_172
where formula_173 is the dimension of the unstable manifold at a given point of the critical manifold, and formula_174 is equal to formula_173 plus the dimension of the critical manifold. If the Morse–Bott function is perturbed by a small function on the critical locus, the index of all critical points of the perturbed function on a critical manifold of the unperturbed function will lie between formula_173 and formula_177

Morse–Bott functions are useful because generic Morse functions are difficult to work with; the functions one can visualize, and with which one can easily calculate, typically have symmetries. They often lead to positive-dimensional critical manifolds. Raoul Bott used Morse–Bott theory in his original proof of the Bott periodicity theorem.

Round functions are examples of Morse–Bott functions, where the critical sets are (disjoint unions of) circles.

Morse homology can also be formulated for Morse–Bott functions; the differential in Morse–Bott homology is computed by a spectral sequence. Frederic Bourgeois sketched an approach in the course of his work on a Morse–Bott version of symplectic field theory, but this work was never published due to substantial analytic difficulties.

<doc id="348581" wikidata="Q2247005" url="?curid=348581" title="The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock">
<text>&quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; is the first professionally published poem by the American-born British poet T. S. Eliot (1888–1965). The poem relates the varying thoughts of its title character in a stream of consciousness. Eliot began writing the poem in February 1910, and it was first published in the June 1915 issue of &quot;Poetry: A Magazine of Verse&quot; at the instigation of fellow American expatriate Ezra Pound. It was later printed as part of a twelve-poem chapbook entitled &quot;Prufrock and Other Observations&quot; in 1917. At the time of its publication, the poem was considered outlandish, but the poem is now seen as heralding a paradigmatic shift in poetry from late 19th-century Romanticism and Georgian lyrics to Modernism.

The poem&#x27;s structure was heavily influenced by Eliot&#x27;s extensive reading of Dante Alighieri and makes several references to the Bible and other literary works—including William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Henry IV Part II&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and &quot;Hamlet&quot;; the poetry of 17th-century metaphysical poet Andrew Marvell; and the 19th-century French Symbolists. Eliot narrates the experience of Prufrock using the stream of consciousness technique developed by his fellow Modernist writers. The poem, described as a &quot;drama of literary anguish&quot;, is a dramatic interior monologue of an urban man stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action that is said &quot;to epitomize [the] frustration and impotence of the modern individual&quot; and &quot;represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment&quot;.

Prufrock laments his physical and intellectual inertia, the lost opportunities in his life, and lack of spiritual progress, and is haunted by reminders of unattained carnal love. With visceral feelings of weariness, regret, embarrassment, longing, emasculation, sexual frustration, a sense of decay, and an awareness of aging and mortality, the poem has become one of the most recognized works in modern literature.

==Composition and publication history==
===Writing and first publication===
Eliot wrote &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; between February 1910 and July or August 1911. Shortly after arriving in England to attend Merton College, Oxford in 1914, Eliot was introduced to American expatriate poet Ezra Pound, who instantly deemed Eliot &quot;worth watching&quot; and aided the start of Eliot&#x27;s career. Pound served as the overseas editor of &quot;Poetry: A Magazine of Verse&quot; and recommended to the magazine&#x27;s founder, Harriet Monroe, that &quot;Poetry&quot; publish &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot;, extolling that Eliot and his work embodied a new and unique phenomenon among contemporary writers. Pound claimed that Eliot &quot;has actually trained himself AND modernized himself on his own. The rest of the &quot;promising&quot; young have done one or the other, but never both.&quot; The poem was first published by the magazine in its June 1915 issue.

In November 1915 &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; — along with Eliot&#x27;s poems &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot;, &quot;The Boston Evening Transcript&quot;, &quot;Hysteria&quot;, and &quot;Miss Helen Slingsby&quot; — was included in &quot;Catholic Anthology 1914–1915&quot; edited by Ezra Pound and printed by Elkin Mathews in London. In June 1917 The Egoist Ltd, a small publishing firm run by Dora Marsden, published a pamphlet entitled &quot;Prufrock and Other Observations&quot; (London), containing 12 poems by Eliot. &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; was the first in the volume. Eliot was appointed assistant editor of &quot;The Egoist&quot; periodical in June 1917.

===Prufrock&#x27;s Pervigilium===
According to Eliot biographer Lyndall Gordon, while Eliot was writing the first drafts of &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; in his notebook in 1910–1911, he intentionally kept four pages blank in the middle section of the poem. According to the notebooks, now in the collection of the New York Public Library, Eliot finished the poem, which was originally published sometime in July and August 1911, when he was 22 years old. In 1912, Eliot revised the poem and included a 38-line section now called &quot;Prufrock&#x27;s Pervigilium&quot; which was inserted on those blank pages, and intended as a middle section for the poem. However, Eliot removed this section soon after seeking the advice of his fellow Harvard acquaintance and poet Conrad Aiken. This section would not be included in the original publication of Eliot&#x27;s poem but was included when published posthumously in the 1996 collection of Eliot&#x27;s early, unpublished drafts in &quot;Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909–1917&quot;. This &quot;Pervigilium&quot; section describes the &quot;vigil&quot; of Prufrock through an evening and night described by one reviewer as an &quot;erotic foray into the narrow streets of a social and emotional underworld&quot; that portray &quot;in clammy detail Prufrock&#x27;s tramping &#x27;through certain half-deserted streets&#x27; and the context of his &#x27;muttering retreats / Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels.

===Critical reception===

Critical publications initially dismissed the poem. An unsigned review in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; from 1917 found: &quot;The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone – even to himself. They certainly have no relation to &#x27;poetry,&#x27; [...].&quot; Another unsigned review from the same year imagined Eliot saying &quot;I&#x27;ll just put down the first thing that comes into my head, and call it &#x27;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.&#x27;&quot;

The Harvard Vocarium at Harvard College recorded Eliot&#x27;s reading of &quot;Prufrock&quot; and other poems in 1947, as part of its ongoing series of poetry readings by its authors.

==Description==

===Title===
In his early drafts, Eliot gave the poem the subtitle &quot;Prufrock among the Women.&quot; This subtitle was apparently discarded before publication. Eliot called the poem a &quot;love song&quot; in reference to Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;The Love Song of Har Dyal&quot;, first published in Kipling&#x27;s collection &quot;Plain Tales from the Hills&quot; (1888). In 1959, Eliot addressed a meeting of the Kipling Society and discussed the influence of Kipling upon his own poetry:
Traces of Kipling appear in my own mature verse where no diligent scholarly sleuth has yet observed them, but which I am myself prepared to disclose. I once wrote a poem called &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot;: I am convinced that it would never have been called &quot;Love Song&quot; but for a title of Kipling&#x27;s that stuck obstinately in my head: &quot;The Love Song of Har Dyal&quot;.
However, the origin of the name Prufrock is not certain, and Eliot never remarked on its origin other than to claim he was unsure of how he came upon the name. Many scholars and indeed Eliot himself have pointed towards the autobiographical elements in the character of Prufrock, and Eliot at the time of writing the poem was in the habit of rendering his name as &quot;T. Stearns Eliot&quot;, very similar in form to that of J. Alfred Prufrock. It is suggested that the name &quot;Prufrock&quot; came from Eliot&#x27;s youth in St. Louis, Missouri, where the Prufrock-Litton Company, a large furniture store, occupied one city block downtown at 420–422 North Fourth Street. In a 1950 letter, Eliot said: &quot;I did not have, at the time of writing the poem, and have not yet recovered, any recollection of having acquired this name in any way, but I think that it must be assumed that I did, and that the memory has been obliterated.&quot;

===Epigraph===
The draft version of the poem&#x27;s epigraph comes from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot; (XXVI, 147–148):
He finally decided not to use this, but eventually used the quotation in the closing lines of his 1922 poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. The quotation that Eliot did choose comes from Dante also. &quot;Inferno&quot; (XXVII, 61–66) reads:
In context, the epigraph refers to a meeting between Dante Alighieri and Guido da Montefeltro, who was condemned to the eighth circle of Hell for providing counsel to Pope Boniface VIII, who wished to use Guido&#x27;s advice for a nefarious undertaking. This encounter follows Dante&#x27;s meeting with Ulysses, who himself is also condemned to the circle of the Fraudulent. According to Ron Banerjee, the epigraph serves to cast ironic light on Prufrock&#x27;s intent. Like Guido, Prufrock had never intended his story to be told, and so by quoting Guido, Eliot reveals his view of Prufrock&#x27;s love song.

Frederick Locke contends that Prufrock himself is suffering from a split personality, and that he embodies both Guido and Dante in the &quot;Inferno&quot; analogy. One is the storyteller; the other the listener who later reveals the story to the world. He posits, alternatively, that the role of Guido in the analogy is indeed filled by Prufrock, but that the role of Dante is filled by the reader (&quot;Let us go then, you and I&quot;). In that, the reader is granted the power to do as he pleases with Prufrock&#x27;s love song.

===Themes and interpretation===
Since the poem is concerned primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator, it can be difficult to interpret. Laurence Perrine wrote that &quot;[the poem] presents the apparently random thoughts going through a person&#x27;s head within a certain time interval, in which the transitional links are psychological rather than logical&quot;. This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine what in the poem is literal and what is symbolic. On the surface, &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle-aged man who wants to say something but is afraid to do so, and ultimately does not. The dispute, however, lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking, whether he is actually &quot;going&quot; anywhere, what he wants to say, and to what the various images refer.

The intended audience is not evident. Some believe that Prufrock is talking to another person or directly to the reader, while others believe Prufrock&#x27;s monologue is internal. Perrine writes &quot;The &#x27;you and I&#x27; of the first line are divided parts of Prufrock&#x27;s own nature&quot;, while professor emerita of English Mutlu Konuk Blasing suggests that the &quot;you and I&quot; refers to the relationship between the dilemmas of the character and the author. Similarly, critics dispute whether Prufrock is going somewhere during the course of the poem. In the first half of the poem, Prufrock uses various outdoor images and talks about how there will be time for various things before &quot;the taking of a toast and tea&quot;, and &quot;time to turn back and descend the stair.&quot; This has led many to believe that Prufrock is on his way to an afternoon tea, where he is preparing to ask this &quot;overwhelming question&quot;. Others, however, believe that Prufrock is not physically going anywhere, but instead is imagining it in his mind.

Perhaps the most significant dispute lies over the &quot;overwhelming question&quot; that Prufrock is trying to ask. Many believe that Prufrock is trying to tell a woman of his romantic interest in her, pointing to the various images of women&#x27;s arms and clothing and the final few lines in which Prufrock laments that mermaids will not sing to him. Others, however, believe that Prufrock is trying to express some deeper philosophical insight or disillusionment with society, but fears rejection, pointing to statements that express a disillusionment with society, such as &quot;I have measured out my life with coffee spoons&quot; (line 51). Many believe that the poem is a criticism of Edwardian society and Prufrock&#x27;s dilemma represents the inability to live a meaningful existence in the modern world. McCoy and Harlan wrote &quot;For many readers in the 1920s, Prufrock seemed to epitomize the frustration and impotence of the modern individual. He seemed to represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment.&quot;

In general, Eliot uses imagery of aging and decay to represent Prufrock&#x27;s self-image. For example, &quot;When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table&quot; (lines 2–3), the &quot;sawdust restaurants&quot; and &quot;cheap hotels&quot;, the yellow fog, and the afternoon &quot;Asleep...tired... or it malingers&quot; (line 77), are reminiscent of languor and decay, while Prufrock&#x27;s various concerns about his hair and teeth, as well as the mermaids &quot;Combing the white hair of the waves blown back / When the wind blows the water white and black,&quot; show his concern over aging.

===Use of allusion===
Like many of Eliot&#x27;s poems, &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; makes numerous allusions to other works, which are often symbolic themselves.

* In &quot;Time for all the works and days of hands&quot; (29) &quot;Works and Days&quot; is the title of a long poem – a description of agricultural life and a call to toil – by the early Greek poet Hesiod.
* &quot;I know the voices dying with a dying fall&quot; (52) echoes Orsino&#x27;s first lines in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.
* The prophet of &quot;Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter / I am no prophet – and here&#x27;s no great matter&quot; (81–2) is John the Baptist, whose head was delivered to Salome by Herod as a reward for her dancing (Matthew 14:1–11, and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s play &quot;Salome&quot;).
* &quot;To have squeezed the universe into a ball&quot; (92) and &quot;indeed there will be time&quot; (23) echo the closing lines of Andrew Marvell&#x27;s &#x27;To His Coy Mistress&#x27;. Other phrases such as, &quot;there will be time&quot; and &quot;there is time&quot; are reminiscent of the opening line of that poem: &quot;Had we but world enough and time&quot;.
* I am Lazarus, come from the dead (94) may be either the beggar Lazarus (of Luke 16) returning on behalf of the rich man who was not permitted to return from the dead, to warn the rich man&#x27;s brothers about Hell, or the Lazarus (of John 11) whom Jesus Christ raised from the dead, or both.
* &quot;Full of high sentence&quot; (117) echoes Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s description of the Clerk of Oxford in the General Prologue to &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.
* &quot;There will be time to murder and create&quot; is a biblical allusion to Ecclesiastes 3.
* In the final section of the poem, Prufrock rejects the idea that he is Prince Hamlet, suggesting that he is merely &quot;an attendant lord&quot; (112) whose purpose is to &quot;advise the prince&quot; (114), a likely allusion to Polonius – Polonius being also &quot;almost, at times, the Fool.&quot;
* &quot;Among some talk of you and me&quot; may be a reference to of Edward FitzGerald&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot; (&quot;There was a Door to which I found no Key / There was a Veil past which I could not see / Some little Talk awhile of &quot;Me&quot; and &quot;Thee&quot; / There seemed – and then no more of &quot;Thee&quot; and &quot;Me&quot;.&quot;)
*&quot;I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each&quot; has been suggested transiently to be a poetic allusion to John Donne&#x27;s &quot;Song: Go and catch a falling star&quot; or Gérard de Nerval&#x27;s &quot;El Desdichado&quot;, and this discussion used to illustrate and explore the intentional fallacy and the place of poet&#x27;s intention in critical inquiry.

<doc id="348586" wikidata="Q641678" url="?curid=348586" title="Thoth Tarot">
<text>Thoth Tarot is an esoteric tarot deck painted by Lady Frieda Harris according to instructions from Aleister Crowley. Crowley referred to this deck as The Book of Thoth, and also wrote a 1944 book of that title intended for use with the deck.

==Background==
Crowley originally intended the Thoth deck to be a six-month project aimed at updating the traditional pictorial symbolism of the tarot. However, due to increased scope, the project eventually spanned five years, between 1938 and 1943.

==Symbolism==
The illustrations of the deck feature symbolism based upon Crowley&#x27;s incorporation of imagery from many disparate disciplines, including science and philosophy and various occult systems (as described in detail in his &quot;The Book of Thoth&quot;).

==Deck variants==
As reported in the table below there are six known major versions of the Thoth Tarot with significant differences.

==Differences from the Rider–Waite Tarot==
===Order and names of trumps===
Crowley renamed several of the trumps compared to earlier arrangements, and also re-arranged the numerical, astrological and Hebrew alphabet correspondences of 4 trumps compared to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn&#x27;s inner order deck in accordance with the Tarot of Marseilles, his 1904 book &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; (&quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot;) and its &quot;New Commentary.&quot; In the &quot;New Commentary&quot; and &quot;The Book of Thoth&quot;, Crowley demonstrates that his trump arrangement forms a double loop in the zodiac-number and letter-number correspondences compared to the Golden Dawn deck, where there is no loop.



===Names of court cards===
Crowley accepted the Golden Dawn&#x27;s changed names of all the court cards which can cause some confusion for people used to the more common decks. Specially since he changed the structure of the court cards, while each of the places retains much of the original meanings, there are subtle differences. The typical corresponding names are as follows:

==Minor Arcana==
===Wands===
===Cups===
===Swords===
===Disks===
==Restoration of original artwork==
Harris&#x27; renditions of the tarot are on watercolor paper affixed to a thick backing; the acidity of the backing, according to a report from 2006, resulted in discoloration of borders, and to some extent, the paintings themselves. The paintings also required cleaning and the repair of small tears. A conservation plan called for cleaning the surfaces, the removal of backing (while retaining original inscriptions), reuse of the hand-painted window mats, and replacement of overlays with acid-free, museum-quality paper. The project was completed in 2011. The paintings are stored by the Warburg Institute; work was completed by the Institute&#x27;s in-house specialist, Susan Campion.

<text>The Hashmallim ( ; sing. Hashmal, ; rendered amber by the Authorized Version) are angelic entities in Judaism.

The word &quot;hashmal&quot; appears in the Hebrew Bible in Ezekiel 1:4-5:
Hashmallim occupy the fourth rank of ten in Maimonides&#x27; exposition of the Jewish angelic hierarchy.

The Septuagint translates &quot;hashmal&quot; to ηλεκτρον (&quot;elektron&quot;), which means &quot;amber&quot; in English. Later, &quot;hashmal&quot; became the Modern Hebrew word that translates to the English word &quot;electricity.&quot; Jewish poet Judah Leib Gordon coined the modern Hebrew word, in his 1878 collection &quot;Gabashta&quot;.

It is still supported in the 16-bit version of version 4.0, but was made obsolete by OCXs. VBX has also been supported in the first, 16-bit version of Borland Delphi.

The VBX specification was created so that developers could extend Visual Basic. Since at the time Visual Basic was an interpreted language with limited speed, VBXs, which were most often written in C or C++, provided the ability to create very powerful and efficient user interface sub-components which could be assembled into applications using Visual Basic as the glue.

Visual Basic 4.0 added support for the newer OLE Controls or OCXs (which became ActiveX controls), implicitly deprecating VBX controls. OCXs are based on the Component Object Model.

Each version of Visual Basic has come with many controls. By incorporating VBX controls into Visual Basic, Microsoft spawned the first commercially viable market for reusable software components. Third parties have created a large market of custom controls for resale.

VBX components were called &quot;custom controls&quot; because the Microsoft development team envisioned them as visual &quot;control&quot; components like a toggle switch or button. Enterprising third party software component developers saw opportunities to use the VBX specification for non-visual components, such as components for creating ZIP files, manipulating low-level system settings and communicating with TCP/IP.

<text>Friheten () is a Norwegian language biweekly newspaper, published by the Norwegian Communist Party (NKP).

==History and profile==
&quot;Friheten&quot; was founded illegally in 1941 during the German occupation of Norway due to World War II. The founders were the members of the communist wing of the resistance movement. The paper was started as a news sheet by the group and became a regular newspaper with the publication of its first issue on 14 May 1945. After the liberation in 1945 it emerged as the official party newspaper.

It is the last party-dependent newspaper left in Norway. The paper has its headquarters in Oslo.

The editor is Harald Øystein Reppesgaard.

<text>Ernst Friedrich Schumacher (16 August 1911 – 4 September 1977) was a German-born British statistician and economist who is best known for his proposals for human-scale, decentralised and appropriate technologies. He served as Chief Economic Advisor to the British National Coal Board from 1950 to 1970, and founded the Intermediate Technology Development Group (now known as Practical Action) in 1966.

In 1995, his 1973 book &quot;Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered&quot; was ranked by &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; as one of the 100 most influential books published since World War II. In 1977 he published &quot;A Guide for the Perplexed&quot; as a critique of materialistic scientism and as an exploration of the nature and organisation of knowledge.

==Early life==
Schumacher was born in Bonn, Germany in 1911. His father was a professor of political economy. The younger Schumacher studied in Bonn and Berlin, then from 1930 in England as a Rhodes Scholar at New College, Oxford, and later at Columbia University in New York City, earning a diploma in economics. He then worked in business, farming and journalism. His sister, Elizabeth, was the wife of the physicist Werner Heisenberg.

==Economist==

===Protégé of Keynes===
Schumacher moved back to England prior to the outbreak of World War II. For a period during the war, he was interned on an isolated English farm as an &quot;enemy alien&quot;. In these years, Schumacher captured the attention of John Maynard Keynes with a paper entitled &quot;Multilateral Clearing&quot; that he had written between sessions working in the fields of the internment camp. Keynes recognised the young German&#x27;s understanding and abilities, and he was able to have Schumacher released from internment. Schumacher helped the British government mobilise economically and financially during World War II, and Keynes found a position for him at Oxford University.

According to Leopold Kohr&#x27;s obituary for Schumacher, when &quot;Multilateral Clearing&quot; &quot;was published in the spring of 1943 in &quot;Economica&quot;, it caused some embarrassment to Keynes who, instead of arranging for its separate publication, had incorporated the text almost verbatim in his famous &quot;Plan for an International Clearing Union&quot;, which the British government issued as a White Paper a few weeks later.&quot;

===Adviser to the Coal Board===
After the war, Schumacher worked as an economic advisor to, and later Chief Statistician for, the British Control Commission, which was charged with rebuilding the German economy. From 1950 to 1970 he was Chief Economic Adviser to the National Coal Board, one of the world&#x27;s largest organisations, with 800,000 employees. In this position, he argued that coal, not petroleum, should be used to supply the energy needs of the world&#x27;s population. He saw oil as a finite resource, fearing its depletion and eventually prohibitive price, and viewed with alarm the reality that &quot;the richest and cheapest reserves are located in some of the world&#x27;s most unstable countries&quot;.

His position on the Coal Board was often mentioned later by those introducing Schumacher or his ideas. It is generally thought that his farsighted planning contributed to Britain&#x27;s post-war economic recovery. Schumacher predicted the rise of OPEC and many of the problems of nuclear power.

===Thinking outside the box===
In 1955, Schumacher travelled to Burma as an economic consultant. While there, he developed the set of principles he called &quot;Buddhist economics&quot;, based on the belief that individuals need good work for proper human development. He also proclaimed that &quot;production from local resources for local needs is the most rational way of economic life.&quot; He travelled throughout many Third World countries, encouraging local governments to create self-reliant economies. Schumacher&#x27;s experience led him to become a pioneer of what is now called appropriate technology: user-friendly and ecologically suitable technology applicable to the scale of the community; a concept very close to Ivan Illich&#x27;s conviviality. He founded the Intermediate Technology Development Group (now Practical Action) in 1966. His theories of development have been summed up for many in catch phrases such as &quot;intermediate size&quot;, and &quot;intermediate technology&quot;. He was a trustee of Scott Bader Commonwealth and in 1970 the president of the Soil Association.

E. F. Schumacher was greatly influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and J. C. Kumarappa and Gandhi&#x27;s concepts of &quot;economy of permanence&quot; and appropriate technology. While delivering the Gandhi Memorial Lecture at the Gandhian Institute of Studies at Varanasi (India) in 1973, Schumacher described Gandhi as the greatest &quot;people&#x27;s economist&quot; whose economic thinking was compatible with spirituality as opposed to materialism.

=== Influence ===
Schumacher was influenced by Richard Henry Tawney, Mahatma Gandhi, Leopold Kohr, Gautama Buddha, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, John Maynard Keynes, A.T. Ariyaratne, John Ruskin and the Catholic Church throughout his life. He and his solutions to the great economic problems influence the Schumacher Center for a New Economics, The Arche, George McRobie, William Schweke, and many others.

==Schumacher as writer==
Schumacher wrote on economics for London&#x27;s &quot;The Times&quot; and became one of the paper&#x27;s chief editorial writers. At this post he was assigned the task of compiling information for the obituary of John Maynard Keynes. He also wrote for &quot;The Economist&quot; and &quot;Resurgence&quot;. He served as adviser to the India Planning Commission, as well as to the governments of Zambia and Burma – an experience that led to his much-read essay &quot;Buddhist Economics&quot;.

The 1973 publication of &quot;Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered&quot;, a collection of essays, finished in the house of his friend Leopold Kohr, brought his ideas to a wider audience. One of his main arguments in &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot; is that we cannot consider the problem of technological production solved if it requires that we recklessly erode our finite natural capital and deprive future generations of its benefits. Schumacher&#x27;s work coincided with the growth of ecological concerns and with the birth of environmentalism, and he became a hero to many in the environmental movement and community movement.

In 1976, he was awarded the Prix Européen de l&#x27;Essai Charles Veillon for &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;.

His 1977 work &quot;A Guide for the Perplexed&quot; is both a critique of materialistic scientism and an exploration of the nature and organisation of knowledge.

===Question of size===
Just like his mentor Leopold Kohr, Schumacher discusses the problems of separatism and regionalism in &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;, which he called &quot;the question of size&quot;. Just like Kohr, Schumacher calls for separatism and decentralisation of humanity into smaller nations and communities. However, instead of focusing on the cultural and social aspects of separatism, he discusses the economic perspective. He criticises the belief that history is based on unification – that tribes formed a nation, which then formed a union of nations, and that now one could look forward to a world government. He notes that the opposite process is taking place as the number of countries worldwide is growing, as large nations break up into smaller ones, and states that &quot;Balkanisation&quot; should not have negative connotations. He questions the idea of &quot;the bigger the better&quot;, arguing that in fact smaller nations perform better economically than bigger nations, and points out that German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Austria were able to become prosperous without the need to join Germany. According to Schumacher, the German unification was not responsible for German economical success, and most of the world&#x27;s wealthiest nations on a per capita basis are small, while the largest countries are poor in comparison. He asserts that the smaller internal market area of a small country is not a hindrance, but rather the basis of great economic potential and development.

Schumacher then notes that the myth of &quot;bigness&quot; also appears in case of corporations, as it&#x27;s &quot;generally told that gigantic organisations are inescapably necessary&quot;. For Schumacher, however, as soon as an organisation of a great size is created, it inevitably entails &quot;a strenuous attempt to attain smallness within bigness&quot; in order to remain efficient; he argues that the General Motors was organised as a federation of medium-sized firms, and recalls his experience in the British National Coal Board, which was decentralised into a &quot;federation of numerous quasi-firms&quot; under Lord Robens. Schumacher asserts that while many still engage in &quot;idolatry of large size&quot;, in practice nobody can deny the &quot;convenience, humanity, and manageability of smallness&quot;. He repeats the arguments of Leopold Kohr – when any body grows too big, it also becomes unmanageable and highly dysfunctional, naming London, New York City and Tokyo examples of overgrown cities, where &quot;the millions do not add to the city&#x27;s real value but merely create enormous problems and produce human degradation&quot;.

He also discusses globalisation, identifying the &quot;idolatry of gigantism&quot; as a harmful belief steming from technological progress – the highly developed communications system greatly increased labor mobility, rendering people &quot;footloose&quot;. He notes that everything needs a structure, and while before the advent of mass transport people were relatively immobile, one was still able to move, such as the Irish immigrants in the United States. Once everything has become extremely mobile, all structures are more vulnerable and threatened than ever. For him, fast transport ended up destroying freedom rather than providing it, given how it made every structure vulnerable and made actions that would mitigate the destructive effects of this technological development necessary. He argues that this problem affects both large and small countries, and that the now extremely high labour mobility might not only destroy social cohesion (resulting in alienation and anomie), but also cause instability:

The factor of footlooseness is, therefore, the more serious, the bigger the country. Its destructive effects can be traced both in the rich and in the poor countries. In the rich countries such as the United States of America, it produces, as already mentioned, &#x27;megalopolis&#x27;. It also produces a rapidly increasing and ever more intractable problem of &#x27;drop-outs&#x27;, of people, who, having become footloose, cannot find a place anywhere in society. Directly connected with this, it produces an appalling problem of crime, alienation, stress, social breakdown, right down to the level of the family. In the poor countries, again most severely in the largest ones, it produces mass migration into cities, mass unemployment, and, as vitality is drained out of the rural areas, the threat of famine. The result is a &#x27;dual society&#x27; without any inner cohesion, subject to a maximum of political instability. 

Schumacher then moves his attention to nation-states, which he also considers endangered by &quot;bigness&quot;, defined as annexation or unification into larger states. He notes that Denmark or Belgium being annexed to Germany and France respectively would stunt their growth, cause their economic potential to be completely neglected, threaten their language and culture, and lastly cause their separatist cause to be dismissed by modern media and politicians:

Imagine that in 1864 Bismarck had annexed the whole of Denmark instead of only a small part of it, and that nothing had happened since. The Danes would be an ethnic minority in Germany, perhaps struggling to maintain their language by becoming bilingual, the official language of course being German. Only by thoroughly Germanising themselves could they avoid becoming second-class citizens. There would be an irresistible drift of the most ambitious and enterprising Danes, thoroughly Germanised, to the mainland in the south, and what then would be the status of Copenhagen? That of a remote provincial city. Or imagine Belgium as part of France. What would be the status of Brussels? Again, that of an unimportant provincial city. I don&#x27;t have to enlarge on it. Imagine now that Denmark a part of Germany, and Belgium a part of France, suddenly turned what is now charmingly called &#x27;nats&#x27; wanting independence. There would be endless, heated arguments that these &#x27;non-countries&#x27; could not be economically viable, that their desire for independence was, to quote a famous political commentator, &#x27;adolescent emotionalism, political naivety, phoney economics, and sheer bare-faced opportunism&#x27;. 

Schumacher continues – nations and states are composed of people, and people are only &quot;viable&quot; when they &quot;can stand on their own feet and earn their keep&quot;. He notes that people won&#x27;t become viable when forced into one huge community, and that they likewise won&#x27;t become &quot;non-viable&quot; when divided into smaller, more coherenent and manageable communities. He argues that separatism should be applauded rather than mocked, as it entails the desire to become a free and self-reliant region. He also mocks unionism, arguing that &quot;if a country wishes to export all over the world, and import from all over the world, it has never been held that it had to annex the whole world in order to do so&quot;. He identifies the question of regionalism as the &quot;most important problem&quot;, but stressed that regionalism does not mean combining states into free-trade systems, but rather developing all the regions within each country.

Schumacher calls separatism a &quot;logical and rational response to the need for regional development&quot; and argues that there is no hope for the poor communities beyond successful regional development. He states that most modern developments only result in widening the gap between the rich and the poor, as they almost exclusively focus on the capital or already wealthy areas instead, as these yield the most profit. Thus modern industrialists seek to make the already very profitable regions even richer, while the poor regions remain miserable. This keeps the poor in the &quot;weakest possible bargaining position&quot;, as the impoverished regions see no development despite needing it the most. Schumacher considers the &quot;economics of gigantism&quot; to be &quot;a left-over of nineteenth-century conditions and nineteenth-century thinking&quot; which no longer applies to modern problems. He argues that modern technological and scientific potential must focus on fighting human degradation, in &quot;intimate contact&quot; with individuals and small groups rather than large states. For Schumacher, democracy is a matter of people, who can only &quot;be themselves&quot; in small and comprehensible groups. He argues that economic thinking is useless if it only engages in &quot;vast abstractions&quot; such as &quot;the national income, the rate of growth, capital/output ratio, input-output analysis, labour mobility, capital accumulation&quot; instead of addressing &quot;the human realities of poverty, frustration, alienation, despair, breakdown, crime, escapism, stress, congestion, ugliness and spiritual death.&quot;

==Later life==
As a young man, Schumacher was a dedicated atheist, but his later rejection of materialist, capitalist, agnostic modernity was paralleled by a growing fascination with religion. He developed an interest in Buddhism, but beginning in the late-1950s, Catholicism heavily influenced his thinking. He noted the similarities between his own economic views and the teaching of papal encyclicals on socio-economic issues, from Leo XIII&#x27;s &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; to Pope John XXIII&#x27;s &quot;Mater et magistra&quot;, as well as with the distributism supported by the Catholic thinkers G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, and Vincent McNabb. Philosophically, he absorbed much of Thomism, which provided an objective system in contrast to what he saw as the self-centered subjectivism and relativism of modern philosophy and society. He also was greatly interested in the tradition of Christian mysticism and read deeply such writers as St. Teresa of Avila and Thomas Merton. These were all interests that he shared with his friend, the Catholic writer Christopher Derrick. In 1971, he converted to Catholicism.

Schumacher gave interviews and published articles for a wide readership in his later years. He also pursued one of the loves of his life: gardening. He died of a heart attack on 4 September 1977, on arrival at Billens hospital in Romont, Switzerland; after falling ill on a train in Zurich during a lecture tour.

==Legacy==
Schumacher&#x27;s personal collection of books and archives is held by the Schumacher Center for a New Economics library in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. The center continues the work of Schumacher by maintaining a research library, organising lectures and seminars, publishing papers, developing model economic programs, and providing technical assistance to groups all for the purpose of linking people, land, and community to build strong, diverse local economies.

===Schumacher Circle===
The Schumacher Circle is a family of organisations which were founded in Schumacher&#x27;s memory or were inspired by his work, and which co-operate to support each other. The circle includes the Schumacher College in Totnes, Devon, &quot;Resurgence Magazine&quot; (now &quot;Resurgence &amp; Ecologist&quot;), publishing company Green Books, international non-governmental organisation Practical Action, the New Economics Foundation in the UK, the Schumacher Center for a New Economics (heir to the legacy programs of the former E. F. Schumacher Society) founded in New England, the Soil Association, the educational Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT) North Wales, the Jeevika Trust, and the research organisation the Schumacher Institute in Bristol.

=== Dr. E. F. Schumacher Society ===

The &quot;Dr. E. F. Schumacher Society&quot;, commonly known as &quot;Schumacher UK&quot;,
was founded in 1978 in Bristol, England.

Schumacher UK and the E. F. Schumacher Society in the USA both spread Schumacher&#x27;s ideas.

=== Schumacher College ===

Schumacher College was founded in 1991. It ran until September 2024.

<doc id="348627" wikidata="Q4932606" url="?curid=348627" title="Bob Greene">
<text>Robert Bernard Greene Jr. (born March 10, 1947) is an American journalist and author. He worked for 24 years for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper, where he was a columnist. Greene has written books on subjects including Michael Jordan, Alice Cooper, and U.S. presidents. His book &quot;Hang Time: Days and Dreams with Michael Jordan&quot; became a bestseller.

==Early life==
Originally from Bexley, Ohio (a suburb of Columbus), Greene attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and became a reporter and feature writer for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; upon graduating in 1969, receiving a regular column in the paper within two years. Greene first drew significant national attention with his book &quot;Billion Dollar Baby&quot; (1974), a diary of his experiences while touring with rock musician Alice Cooper and portraying Santa Claus during the show.

==Newspaper column==
Greene&#x27;s primary focus remained his newspaper column, for which he won the National Headliner Award for best column in 1977 from an American journalism group. Shortly afterward, Greene was hired by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and began making occasional guest appearances on local television, eventually landing a commentary slot on the ABC news program &quot;Nightline&quot;. He also wrote the &quot;American Beat&quot; column in &quot;Esquire&quot;.

According to the September 27, 2021 Wall Street Journal, &quot;columnist Bob Greene, syndicated then in more than 100 newspapers, started the successful WAM movement—We Ain’t Metric—in 1978.&quot;

In January 1980, Greene assisted Los Angeles Police in apprehending a man who had allegedly written letters to Greene as well as to police threatening to go on a killing spree. At that time Greene&#x27;s column appeared in approximately 120 newspapers, including one in the Los Angeles community of Huntington Park where the letter writer lived. In the first week of January, Greene traveled to Los Angeles at the request of police. Through the use of his column, Greene gave out a phone number to his hotel room that the letter writer, who identified himself in letters as &quot;Moulded to Murder&quot;, was to use to contact Greene. Police were able to trace the call and arrest the man at a payphone. Greene chronicled these events in his daily column as they occurred.

In 1989, he asked Vietnam veterans if they had really been spat upon when they returned from overseas. The response was so overwhelming, he published a book—&quot;Homecoming: When the Soldiers Returned From Vietnam&quot;— full of the letters he received.

During the 1990s, Greene spent time covering Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls basketball team, forming an unlikely friendship that Greene documented in two best-selling books. The movie &quot;Funny About Love&quot; (1990) was based on a Greene column. In 1993, his novel &quot;All Summer Long&quot; was published by Doubleday, and his columns are collected in several books.

Though Greene was popular with readers, critics accused him of excessive sentimentality, heavy writing and repetitive coverage of the same subject, most notably the Baby Richard child custody saga. A therapist for the birth parents in the custody case, Karen Moriarty, claimed in the book &quot;Baby Richard: A Four-Year-Old Child Comes Home&quot; that Greene never spoke to the parents, although he covered the subject with 100 columns in which he strongly took the side of the adoptive parents. Greene claimed that the biological parents, the Kirchners, did not respond to his requests for interviews.

The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; ran a derisive column, &quot;BobWatch: We Read Him So You Don&#x27;t Have To,&quot; penned pseudonymously by &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; columnist Neil Steinberg. Greene&#x27;s experiences as a roadie for Alice Cooper were parodied by comics writer Steve Gerber in the background of the villain Dr. Bong (real name: Lester Verde) in the 1970s Marvel comic &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;. Critical coverage of Greene, which offered extensive coverage of his predilection for rewriting pop-culture press releases, was also featured in &quot;Spy&quot; magazine in a December 1988 article by Magda Krance, &quot;You Wouldn&#x27;t Want to Be Bob Greene&quot;. Krance characterized his output as &quot;the journalistic equivalent of Tuna Helper&quot;.

==Dismissal from the &quot;Tribune&quot;==
In September 2002 Greene was forced to resign from his newspaper column after admitting to an unconsummated extramarital sexual relationship 14 years earlier with a high school student.
The student had visited Greene at work for a school project and became the subject of one of his columns. Admission of the affair attracted considerable attention. Reports at the time stated that the woman had reached out to Greene and that he was alarmed enough by whatever she said to contact the FBI, which looked into the matter at a pre-investigative level and did not take any action afterwards. When the news broke, Greene had meetings with his bosses at the &quot;Tribune&quot; (he said later he was ordered not to bring a lawyer to one of them, with the &quot;Tribune&quot; stating they never said that) and offered to resign. He was surprised when the &quot;Tribune&quot; told him his resignation was accepted, and the paper publicly stated that he had been dismissed for &quot;abusing his position for his own benefit&quot; but did not provide details at that point. The full story, that he was basically told to leave and did so on non-criminal grounds, did not emerge fully until months later.

The woman with whom Greene had a relationship was 17, legal age in Illinois, and had graduated from high school in the months between their first meeting and his invitation to take her out to dinner. Their sole hotel tryst was described in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; as a &quot;sexual encounter that stopped short of intercourse,&quot; and Greene told &quot;Esquire&quot; that he demurred at going further, telling her, &quot;You should wait to do this with someone you love.&quot;

Four months after Greene&#x27;s resignation from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, his wife Susan died of heart failure following a month-long respiratory illness.

==Current books==
Greene did not return to newspaper or magazine journalism. He continues to write books and is a contributing writer to CNN.com. His 2006 book, &quot;And You Know You Should Be Glad: A True Story of Lifelong Friendship&quot;, is a personal account of the illness and death of his lifelong friend Jack Roth at age 57. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewed it as follows:

Bestselling author Greene... looks back on his youth in Bexley, Ohio (pop. 13,000), where he and his four pals grew up together, calling themselves ABCDJ (for Allen, Bob, Chuck, Dan and Jack)... Greene met Jack in kindergarten, and they remained best friends for life. Remembering people and places they shared, the two revisit old haunts, discovering that their beloved Toddle House, where they once went for late-night chocolate pie, is now a Pizza Plus. Greene&#x27;s repetitive, rambling free associations recall everything from his Halloween costume and old songs to ice cream parlors, state fairs and clothing fads. Unfortunately, the author&#x27;s dusty attic of lost Americana is cluttered with clichés, nostalgia and overly sentimental yearnings.

His next book, &quot;When We Get to Surf City: A Journey through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams&quot;, was released on May 13, 2008. It is a chronicle of a 15-year period when he intermittently toured with surf-rock musicians Jan and Dean, singing backup and playing guitar.

His most recent book, &quot;Late Edition: A Love Story&quot; was released on July 7, 2009. In it, he wistfully chronicles his days as a copyboy and other apprentice positions at the &quot;Columbus Citizen-Journal&quot; and the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot;.

==Awards and honors==

In 1977, Greene won the National Headliner Award for writing the previous year&#x27;s best column.

In 1995, Greene was named Illinois Journalist of the Year. In the same year he was awarded the Peter Lisagor Award for Public Service Journalism for his reporting on courts failing children in need.

==Personal life==

Greene has two children with Susan Koebel Greene.

Ruff was born in Brooklyn, New York City, in 1965, to a Lutheran family of German ancestry. His father was a hospital chaplain, and his maternal grandfather was a missionary. At the age of 5, he decided he wanted to be a fiction writer. He spent his childhood and adolescence learning how to tell stories. In elementary school, he wrote a number of short stories, many of them starring his classmates in scenarios cribbed from movies or TV. Ruff has said that reading these aloud in English class was his first experience performing in front of an audience and his first solid evidence that he had what it took to entertain people with his storytelling. 

Many adults around him attempted to persuade him to choose a different career, but Ruff&#x27;s mother was supportive of his hope to become a writer; for one of Ruff&#x27;s birthdays, she bought him an IBM Selectric typewriter. From third to eighth grade, Ruff attended a parochial school. He attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. One of his teachers there was the memoirist Frank McCourt.

Ruff&#x27;s first sustained effort at a novel was a soap opera–like story about a family with a lot of children (having only older half siblings, Ruff was fascinated by the concept of siblings). He wrote it in the 1970s, but never published it. Describing it, Ruff said &quot;Think &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot; with surreal elements. There was no overall plot, just a series of loosely linked episodes—a chapter about the boys and girls digging competing tunnel systems under the house would be followed by one in which they got infected by some weird flu strain and started passing out in the halls. Periodically I’d set aside what I’d written and start the whole thing over again&quot;.

During Ruff&#x27;s last semester at Cornell University, his mother died. He graduated in 1987. One of Ruff&#x27;s English professors had been Alison Lurie, who helped Ruff find an agent.

His father died after Ruff&#x27;s first novel was published.

==Unpublished novels==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Ruff wrote a fantasy novel that he never completed. Between 1982 and 1984, Ruff wrote a semi-autobiographical novel about a Lutheran Minister&#x27;s son who questions his faith. Part of Ruff&#x27;s motive for writing the novel was to let his parents know he wasn&#x27;t going to be a devout Christian, which they had hoped he would.

In 1985, Ruff wrote a coming-of-age story set in Queens called &quot;Today&#x27;s Tom Sawyer&quot;, over the summer between his sophomore and junior years at Cornell. It had upwards of 400 pages, which Ruff wrote in three months. Ruff based a character in the story on a female student in his class, and gave her a copy of the finished manuscript.

==Published works==
Ruff&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot;, is a fantasy that drew on his experiences living in Risley Residential College at Cornell. It was first written as his senior thesis in Honors English. It was published shortly after Ruff graduated from the university.

His second book, &quot;Sewer, Gas &amp; Electric: The Public Works Trilogy&quot;, is postcyberpunk.

His third book, &quot;Set This House in Order: A Romance of Souls&quot;, focuses on two protagonists displaying a fictionalized version of dissociative identity disorder; while not technically science fiction, it nonetheless contains significant speculative elements.

<text>In ufology, a close encounter is an event in which a person witnesses an unidentified flying object (UFO) at relatively close range, where the possibility of mis-identification is presumably greatly reduced. This terminology and the system of classification behind it were first suggested in astronomer and UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek&#x27;s book &quot;The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry&quot; (1972). Categories beyond Hynek&#x27;s original three have been added by others but have not gained universal acceptance, mainly because they lack the scientific rigor that Hynek aimed to bring to ufology.

Distant sightings more than from the witness are classified as &quot;daylight discs&quot;, &quot;nocturnal lights&quot;, or &quot;radar/visual reports&quot;. Sightings within about are sub-classified as various types of close encounters. Hynek and others argued that a claimed close encounter must occur within about to greatly reduce or eliminate the possibility of misidentifying conventional aircraft or other known phenomena.

Hynek&#x27;s scale became well known after being referenced in the classic sci-fi film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977), which is named after the third level of the scale. Promotional posters for the film featured the three levels of the scale, and Hynek himself makes a cameo appearance near the end of the film.

==Hynek&#x27;s scale==
Hynek devised a six-fold classification for UFO sightings.

The six levels are arranged according to increasing proximity:
=== Bloecher subtypes ===
UFO researcher Ted Bloecher proposed six sub-types for the close encounters of the third kind in Hynek&#x27;s scale:

==Extensions of Hynek&#x27;s scale==
After Hynek&#x27;s death in , his colleague Jacques Vallee extended Hynek&#x27;s classification system by two steps, specifically close encounters of the fourth and fifth kinds, as published in Vallee&#x27;s book &quot;Confrontations: A Scientist&#x27;s Search for Alien Contact&quot; (1990).

The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) immediately adopted the extensions to the classification scale and has used them ever since.

===Close encounters of the fourth kind (CE4)===
A close encounter of the fourth kind is a UFO event in which a human is abducted by a UFO or its occupants. This type was not included in Hynek&#x27;s original close encounters scale.

Hynek&#x27;s former associate Jacques Vallée argued in the &quot;Journal of Scientific Exploration&quot; that the &quot;fourth kind&quot; should refer to &quot;cases when witnesses experienced a transformation of their sense of reality&quot;, to also include non-abduction cases where absurd, hallucinatory or dreamlike events are associated with UFO encounters.

The film &quot;The Fourth Kind&quot; (2009) makes reference to this category.

===Close encounters of the fifth kind (CE5)===
As stated in Vallee&#x27;s &quot;Confrontations&quot; (1990), a close encounter of the fifth kind is where an alien abductee receives some manner of physical effect from their close encounter, typically either injury or healing.

Several years after Vallee&#x27;s classification updates, some preferred that a close encounter of the fifth kind instead refer to human-initiated contact with extraterrestrial life forms or advanced interstellar civilizations, claiming direct communication between aliens and humans. This alternate interpretation of what a close encounter of the fifth kind (ce5) should represent has been attributed to Steven M. Greer. While technically not an extension of the Vallee scale that measures result-oriented data, this replacement of the originally coined CE5 classification has become popular in marketing human-initiated contact events.

In a CE5 event, individuals or groups use specific protocols to establish communication or interaction with extraterrestrial beings. These protocols primarily involve the use of contact meditation and use of sounds or signals. Close encounters of the fifth kind is also referred to as human initiated close encounter.

===Close encounters of the sixth h kind (CE6)===
This the term used to describe a sexual encounter between a human and an extraterrestrial species.

<doc id="348639" wikidata="Q49223" url="?curid=348639" title="Panties">
<text>Panties are women&#x27;s form-fitting underpants. Typical components include an elastic waistband, a crotch panel to cover the genitalia (usually lined with absorbent material such as cotton), and a pair of leg openings that, like the waistband, are often made of elastomer. Various materials are used, but are usually chosen to be breathable.

Panties are made of a variety of materials, including cotton, lace, latex, leather, lycra, mesh, nylon, PVC, polyester, rawhide, satin, and silk. Construction typically consists of two pieces (front and rear) that are joined by seams at the crotch and sides; an additional gusset is often in the crotch, with the waistband and leg-openings made from elastomer.

==Terminology==
In the United States and Canada, &quot;panties&quot; is the preferred term to refer to female undergarments. In the United Kingdom and occasionally in other Commonwealth countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland, panties may be referred to as &quot;knickers&quot;, &quot;undies&quot;, or simply &quot;underwear&quot;. The last two of these are gender-neutral terms and can be used for either male or female styles of underwear bottoms, the American English equivalent being underpants. In Australia, male underpants are often referred to as &quot;undies&quot;, although the word can also refer to panties.

== Styles ==

Panties are classified into various styles based on criteria such as the amount of rear coverage, width at the sides and height at which they are worn. These categories are not necessarily distinct and usage may vary somewhat among brands:

* Adhesive panties are sometimes described as strapless/stick-on panties. They are a form of micro-panties that cover nothing but the genitalia. They are useful when women do not want a panty line to be visible, but still want to maintain basic hygiene.
* Hipsters are a blend between bikinis and boyshorts. They sit on the hips of the wearer and are worn slightly below the navel.
* Bikinis, like hipsters, sit at hip level, but the fabric of the side sections is narrower. With the string bikini type, the side sections disappear altogether and the waistband consists of only string-like material. There may be less rear coverage with the bikini style.
* Boyshorts cover the hips and are named for their similarity to boxer briefs, a variation on boxer shorts. Some resemble men&#x27;s briefs, complete with fly and contrast trim. Unlike men&#x27;s briefs, this style is usually lower cut. Boyshorts often cover most of the buttocks.
* Briefs rise to the waist, or just below the navel, and have full coverage in the rear.
** Classic briefs have the waistband sitting very high on the waist. The leg holes are small so the underwear cover as much area between waist and thigh as possible. Sometimes called &quot;granny panties&quot; because they were the standard underpants in previous decades and have a connotation of being worn by older women.
** Control briefs are designed to offer support while giving a slimmer appearance. This type usually contains a stretch material such as spandex and may extend above the waist. Some have an extra firm panel to flatten the tummy. Some also compress the buttocks, while other control briefs are designed to avoid compression of the buttocks. Others merely lift the buttocks and have holes cut out for maximum fullness of the buttocks. 
** High-cut briefs sit higher on the waist, providing more coverage in the midriff region. They are designed with larger leg holes and narrower sides to show off more leg and allow more freedom of movement.
* Cheekies can be styled as a hipster, bikini, or boyshort in the front, but in the rear, they are designed to hug the buttocks, and have a seam or ruching to make the fabric sit partially between the cheeks to accentuate the shape. They leave the outer 1/3 to 1/2 of each cheek exposed and often have a lace or scalloped trim. 
* Thongs provide a moderate to minimal coverage with back coverage that is less than a bikini, and the waistband is reduced to a narrow strip at the sides.
** The G-string has a vertical string at the back, which connects the crotch to the waistband, sometimes featuring a triangle of fabric which is sometimes referred to as a whale tail when it peeks out above the waistband of low riding pants. 
** The T-front is a type of G-string in which the string also reaches the front part. It provides almost no coverage while still maintaining the basic hygienic underwear functions and covering only the genitalia. Usually it is built by strings only, sometimes with more fabric or lace around the waist. 
** Thongs have a waistband similar to tangas, but the rear coverage is mostly cut away. The crotch is triangle-shaped, as it narrows to a thin strip toward the back and sits between the buttocks, becoming wider towards the top where it connects to the waistband. Like the G-string, if the back fabric peeks out above the waistband of low riding pants, the result is also called a whale tail.

<text>Goldfield is an unincorporated town and census-designated place and the county seat of Esmeralda County, Nevada.

It is the locus of the Goldfield CDP which had a resident population of 268 at the 2010 census, down from 440 in 2000. Goldfield is located southeast of Carson City, along U.S. Route 95.

Goldfield was a boomtown in the first decade of the 20th century due to the discovery of gold – between 1903 and 1940, Goldfield&#x27;s mines produced more than $86 million at then-current prices. Much of the town was destroyed by a fire in 1923, although several buildings survived and remain today, notably the Goldfield Hotel, the Consolidated Mines Building (the communications center of the town until 1963), and the schoolhouse. Gold exploration continues in and around the town today.

==History==
The community was named for deposits of gold near the original town site. Gold was discovered at Goldfield in 1902, its year of inception. By 1904, the Goldfield district produced about 800 tons of ore, valued at $2,300,000, 30% of the state&#x27;s production that year. This remarkable production caused Goldfield to grow rapidly, and it soon became the largest town in the state with about 20,000 people.
One notorious, early Goldfield resident was George Graham Rice, a former check forger, newspaperman, and racetrack tipster, turned mining stock promoter. The collapse of his Sullivan Trust Company and its associated mining stocks caused the failure of the Goldfield State Bank in 1907. Rice quickly left Goldfield, but continued to promote mining shares for another quarter-century.

A prominent resident from 1906 was George Wingfield, one of Nevada&#x27;s entrepreneurs, who built the Goldfield Hotel. In collaboration with his partner George S. Nixon (who was to become a US senator in 1904), Wingfield started in Belmont, Nevada in 1901, and saw the potential of Goldfield after mining at Tonopah, north, took off. Nixon and Wingfield made huge fortunes in Goldfield by forming the Goldfield Consolidated Mining Company. By 1906, they were worth $30 million.

Wingfield moved to Reno, where his great wealth could be spread across northern Nevada and northern California.
Between 1903 and 1918, mining in Belmont and Goldfield grew from $2.8 million to $48.6 million.

Wyatt and Virgil Earp came to Goldfield in 1904. Virgil was hired as a Goldfield deputy sheriff in January 1905. In April, he contracted pneumonia and, after six months of illness, died on October 19, 1905. Wyatt left Goldfield shortly afterward.

Goldfield reached a peak population around 20,000 people in 1906 and hosted a lightweight boxing championship match between Joe Gans and Oscar &quot;Battling&quot; Nelson. Goldfield briefly became Nevada&#x27;s largest city.

In addition to the mines, Goldfield was home to large reduction works. The gold output in 1907 was over $8.4 million, the year in which the town became the county seat; in 1908, output was about $4,880,000. In the early 1900s, Consolidated Mining dug an adit at Alkali, Nevada to deliver water to the 100-stamp Combination Mill near Goldfield.

By the 1910 census, its population had declined to 4,838. Part of the problem was the increasing cost of pumping brine out of the diggings, making them uneconomic. By 1912, ore production had dropped to $5 million, and the largest mining company left town in 1919. In 1923, a fire caused by a moonshine still explosion destroyed most of the town&#x27;s flammable buildings. Some brick and stone buildings from before the fire remain, including the hotel and the high school.

=== Labor relations during the boom years ===

Soon after mining on an extensive scale began, the miners organized themselves as a local branch of the Western Federation of Miners, which also included many laborers. Between this branch and the mine owners, serious differences arose, and several strikes occurred in December 1906 and January 1907 for higher wages.

In March and April 1907, the owners refused to discharge carpenters who belonged to American Federation of Labor, but were not members of the Industrial Workers of the World-affiliated Western Federation of Miners; a strike followed, resulting in forcing the IWW out of Goldfield, despite at one point counting the 1,500 miners as well as hundreds of white-collar and service workers as members.

This defeat came after a bitter struggle which saw IWW organizer Vincent St. John first imprisoned and charged with conspiracy, then shot by a gunman in the street on November 5 along with two other IWW members.

Beginning in August 1907, a rule was introduced at some of the mines requiring miners to change their clothing before entering and after leaving the mines – made necessary according to the operators by the wholesale theft of the valuable ore (worth as much as $20 a pound) in a practice known as &quot;high-grading&quot;. In November and December 1907, some of the owners adopted a system of paying in cashier&#x27;s checks. Except for occasional attacks upon nonunion workmen, or persons unsympathetic to the miners&#x27; union, no serious disturbance in Goldfield occurred. However,at the insistence of the mine owners, Governor Sparks, appealed in December 1907 to President Theodore Roosevelt to send federal troops to Goldfield on the grounds that the situation there was ominous, that destruction of life and property seemed probable, and that the state had no militia and would be powerless to maintain order.

On December 4, 1907, Roosevelt ordered the commander of the Division of California at San Francisco, General Frederick Funston, to proceed with 300 federal troops to Goldfield. The troops arrived in Goldfield on December 6, and immediately afterwards, the mine owners reduced wages and announced that no members of the Western Federation of Miners would thereafter be employed in the mines. Roosevelt, becoming convinced that conditions had not warranted Sparks&#x27;s appeal for assistance, but that the immediate withdrawal of the troops might lead to serious disorder, consented that they should remain for a short time on condition that the state should immediately organize an adequate militia or police force. Accordingly, a special meeting of the legislature was immediately called, a state police force was organized, and on March 7, 1908, the troops were withdrawn. Thereafter, work was gradually resumed in the mines, the dispute having been won by the mine-owners.

==Climate==
Goldfield&#x27;s climate is arid (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWk&quot;), bordering on semiarid.

An average of 35.9 afternoons with maximum temperatures of or higher and 146.1 mornings with minimum temperatures of occur. The record high temperature was on July 20, 1906, and June 9, 1935.

Average snowfall is . The most snowfall in one year was in 1969, including the record monthly snowfall of in February 1969.
==Demographics==

The population decline continued throughout the 20th century, dwindling to 275 by 1950.

The 2000 census showed 440 people, 221 households, and 118 families resided in the Goldfield census county division. The racial makeup of the CCD was 93.2% White, 0.2% Black or African American, 2.0% Native American, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 1.4% from other races, and 3.0% from two or more races. About 5.2% of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.

==Present-day attractions==
While the unoccupied buildings of the town remain an attraction, they are not abandoned. Each building has an owner, many with plans to renovate the property. The Goldfield Days festival is held in August each year, featuring parades, booths, historical displays, and a land auction.

The Goldfield Historic District encompasses and is roughly bounded by 5th Street and Miner, Spring, Crystal and Elliott avenues. The district contains nearly 120 buildings, most dating from the time of Goldfield&#x27;s initial boom, 1904 to 1909. Goldfield became a regional and national center of attention during Nevada&#x27;s twentieth century mining boom, comparable to the Great Comstock era in the previous century. On June 14, 1982, the district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Among the buildings located in the Goldfield Historic District are:
* The 1906–08 Goldfield High School, which survived the fire of 1923/24; it is in poor condition, but the Goldfield Historical Society received a matching grant of $296,000 from the National Park Service under the Save America&#x27;s Treasures Grant Program.
* Esmeralda County Courthouse
* The 1907–1908 Goldfield Hotel at Crook Avenue (U.S. 95) and Columbia Street has remained unoccupied since the end of World War II.

Parts of Goldfield, and also parts of nearby Tonopah, served as the fictional town of Baxter, California, in the 1998 film &quot;Desert Blue&quot;.

The town was featured in two episodes of &quot;State Trooper&quot;, Rod Cameron&#x27;s syndicated television series that aired from 1956 to 1959.

In the 1988 movie &quot;Cherry 2000&quot;, Goldfield was used as the set of the fictional town of Glory Hole.

The 1995 movie &quot;The Stranger&quot; was filmed in and around Goldfield.

An abbreviated depiction of Goldfield is featured in the video game &quot;American Truck Simulator&quot;.

<text>In linear algebra, a Vandermonde matrix, named after Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde, is a matrix with the terms of a geometric progression in each row: an formula_1 matrix
:formula_2
with entries formula_3, the &quot;j&quot;th power of the number formula_4, for all zero-based indices formula_5 and formula_6. Some authors define the Vandermonde matrix as the transpose of the above matrix.

The determinant of a square Vandermonde matrix (when formula_7) is called a Vandermonde determinant or Vandermonde polynomial. Its value is:
:formula_8
This is non-zero if and only if all formula_4 are distinct (no two are equal), making the Vandermonde matrix invertible.

==Applications==
The polynomial interpolation problem is to find a polynomial formula_10 which satisfies formula_11 for given data points formula_12. This problem can be reformulated in terms of linear algebra by means of the Vandermonde matrix, as follows. formula_13 computes the values of formula_14 at the points formula_15 via a matrix multiplication formula_16, where formula_17 is the vector of coefficients and formula_18 is the vector of values (both written as column vectors):

formula_19If formula_20 and formula_21 are distinct, then &quot;V&quot; is a square matrix with non-zero determinant, i.e. an invertible matrix. Thus, given &quot;V&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, one can find the required formula_14 by solving for its coefficients formula_23 in the equation formula_16: formula_25. That is, the map from coefficients to values of polynomials is a bijective linear mapping with matrix &quot;V&quot;, and the interpolation problem has a unique solution. This result is called the unisolvence theorem, and is a special case of the Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials.

In statistics, the equation formula_16 means that the Vandermonde matrix is the design matrix of polynomial regression.

In numerical analysis, solving the equation formula_16 naïvely by Gaussian elimination results in an algorithm with time complexity O(&quot;n&quot;3). Exploiting the structure of the Vandermonde matrix, one can use Newton&#x27;s divided differences method (or the Lagrange interpolation formula) to solve the equation in O(&quot;n&quot;2) time, which also gives the UL factorization of formula_28. The resulting algorithm produces extremely accurate solutions, even if formula_13 is ill-conditioned. (See polynomial interpolation.)

The Vandermonde determinant is used in the representation theory of the symmetric group.

When the values formula_4 belong to a finite field, the Vandermonde determinant is also called the Moore determinant, and has properties which are important in the theory of BCH codes and Reed–Solomon error correction codes.

The discrete Fourier transform is defined by a specific Vandermonde matrix, the DFT matrix, where the formula_4 are chosen to be th roots of unity. The Fast Fourier transform computes the product of this matrix with a vector in formula_32 time. See the article on Multipoint Polynomial evaluation for details.

In the physical theory of the quantum Hall effect, the Vandermonde determinant shows that the Laughlin wavefunction with filling factor 1 is equal to a Slater determinant. This is no longer true for filling factors different from 1 in the fractional quantum Hall effect.

In the geometry of polyhedra, the Vandermonde matrix gives the normalized volume of arbitrary formula_33-faces of cyclic polytopes. Specifically, if formula_34 is a formula_33-face of the cyclic polytope formula_36 corresponding to formula_37, thenformula_38

== Determinant ==
The determinant of a square Vandermonde matrix is called a &quot;Vandermonde polynomial&quot; or &quot;Vandermonde determinant&quot;. Its value is the polynomial
:formula_39
which is non-zero if and only if all formula_4 are distinct.

The Vandermonde determinant was formerly sometimes called the &quot;discriminant&quot;, but in current terminology the discriminant of a polynomial formula_41 is the &quot;square&quot; of the Vandermonde determinant of the roots formula_4. The Vandermonde determinant is an alternating form in the formula_4, meaning that exchanging two formula_4 changes the sign, and formula_45 thus depends on order for the formula_4. By contrast, the discriminant formula_47 does not depend on any order, so that Galois theory implies that the discriminant is a polynomial function of the coefficients of formula_14.

The determinant formula is proved below in three ways. The first uses polynomial properties, especially the unique factorization property of multivariate polynomials. Although conceptually simple, it involves non-elementary concepts of abstract algebra. The second proof is based on the linear algebra concepts of change of basis in a vector space and the determinant of a linear map. In the process, it computes the LU decomposition of the Vandermonde matrix. The third proof is more elementary but more complicated, using only elementary row and column operations.

===First proof: Polynomial properties===

The first proof relies on properties of polynomials. 

By the Leibniz formula, formula_45 is a polynomial in the formula_4, with integer coefficients. All entries of the formula_51-th column have total degree formula_52. Thus, again by the Leibniz formula, all terms of the determinant have total degree 
:formula_53
(that is, the determinant is a homogeneous polynomial of this degree).

If, for formula_54, one substitutes formula_4 for formula_56, one gets a matrix with two equal rows, which has thus a zero determinant. Thus, considering the determinant as univariate in formula_57 the factor theorem implies that formula_58 is a divisor of formula_59 It thus follows that for all formula_52 and formula_61, formula_58 is a divisor of formula_59

This will now be strengthened to show that the product of all those divisors of formula_45 is a divisor of formula_59 Indeed, let formula_66 be a polynomial with formula_67 as a factor, then formula_68 for some polynomial formula_69 If formula_70 is another factor of formula_71 then formula_66 becomes zero after the substitution of formula_73 for formula_74 If formula_75 the factor formula_76 becomes zero after this substitution, since the factor formula_67 remains nonzero. So, by the factor theorem, formula_70 divides formula_79 and formula_80 divides formula_81 

Iterating this process by starting from formula_82 one gets that formula_45 is divisible by the product of all formula_67 with formula_85 that is 
:formula_86
where formula_87 is a polynomial. As the product of all formula_58 and formula_45 have the same degree formula_90, the polynomial formula_87 is, in fact, a constant. This constant is one, because the product of the diagonal entries of formula_13 is formula_93, which is also the monomial that is obtained by taking the first term of all factors in formula_94 This proves that formula_95 and finishes the proof.
:formula_96

===Second proof: linear maps===
Let be a field containing all formula_57 and formula_98 the vector space of the polynomials of degree less than or equal to with coefficients in . Let 
:formula_99
be the linear map defined by 
:formula_100.

The Vandermonde matrix is the matrix of formula_101 with respect to the canonical bases of formula_98 and formula_103

Changing the basis of formula_98 amounts to multiplying the Vandermonde matrix by a change-of-basis matrix (from the right). This does not change the determinant, if the determinant of is .

The polynomials formula_105, formula_106, formula_107, …, formula_108 are monic of respective degrees 0, 1, …, . Their matrix on the monomial basis is an upper-triangular matrix (if the monomials are ordered in increasing degrees), with all diagonal entries equal to one. This matrix is thus a change-of-basis matrix of determinant one. The matrix of formula_101 on this new basis is 
:formula_110.
Thus Vandermonde determinant equals the determinant of this matrix, which is the product of its diagonal entries. 

This proves the desired equality. Moreover, one gets the LU decomposition of as formula_111.

===Third proof: row and column operations===

The third proof is based on the fact that if one adds to a column of a matrix the product by a scalar of another column then the determinant remains unchanged.

So, by subtracting to each column – except the first one – the preceding column multiplied by formula_112, the determinant is not changed. (These subtractions must be done by starting from last columns, for subtracting a column that has not yet been changed). This gives the matrix 
:formula_113
Applying the Laplace expansion formula along the first row, we obtain formula_114, with
:formula_115
As all the entries in the formula_52-th row of formula_117 have a factor of formula_118, one can take these factors out and obtain
:formula_119 is a Vandermonde matrix in formula_120. Iterating this process on this smaller Vandermonde matrix, one eventually gets the desired expression of formula_45 as the product of all formula_58 such that formula_123.

===Rank of the Vandermonde matrix===

* An rectangular Vandermonde matrix such that has rank if and only if all are distinct.
* An rectangular Vandermonde matrix such that has rank if and only if there are of the that are distinct.
* A square Vandermonde matrix is invertible if and only if the are distinct. An explicit formula for the inverse is known (see below).

== Generalizations ==

If the columns of the Vandermonde matrix, instead of formula_124, are general polynomials formula_125, such that each one has degree formula_126, that is, if formula_127, formula_128where formula_129 are the head coefficients of formula_125, and formula_131 is the Vandermonde determinant.

By multiplying with the Hermitian conjugate, we find that formula_132


 &lt;/math&gt; Expand them by Taylor expansion. For fixed formula_133, the series is uniformly convergent in formula_134 in a neighborhood of zero.

To find the constant term of formula_135, simply calculate the coefficient of the term formula_136, which is formula_137.

By the symmetry of the determinant, the next lowest-powered term of formula_135 is of form formula_139, which is formula_140 as formula_141.

== Inverse Vandermonde matrix ==
As explained above in Applications, the polynomial interpolation problem for formula_10satisfying formula_143 is equivalent to the matrix equation formula_16, which has the unique solution formula_25. There are other known formulas which solve the interpolation problem, which must be equivalent to the unique formula_25, so they must give explicit formulas for the inverse matrix formula_28. In particular, Lagrange interpolation shows that the columns of the inverse matrix 

formula_148 

are the coefficients of the Lagrange polynomials formula_149where formula_150. This is easily demonstrated: the polynomials clearly satisfy formula_151 for formula_152 while formula_153, so we may compute the product formula_154, the identity matrix.

== Confluent Vandermonde matrices ==

As described before, a Vandermonde matrix describes the linear algebra interpolation problem of finding the coefficients of a polynomial formula_14 of degree formula_156 based on the values formula_157, where formula_158 are &quot;distinct&quot; points. If formula_4 are not distinct, then this problem does not have a unique solution (and the corresponding Vandermonde matrix is singular). However, if we specify the values of the derivatives at the repeated points, then the problem can have a unique solution. For example, the problem

:formula_160

where formula_161, has a unique solution for all formula_162 with formula_163. In general, suppose that formula_164 are (not necessarily distinct) numbers, and suppose for simplicity that equal values are adjacent:

:formula_165

where formula_166 and formula_167 are distinct. Then the corresponding interpolation problem is

:formula_168

The corresponding matrix for this problem is called a confluent Vandermonde matrix, given as follows. If formula_169, then formula_170 for a unique formula_171 (denoting formula_172). We let

:formula_173

This generalization of the Vandermonde matrix makes it non-singular, so that there exists a unique solution to the system of equations, and it possesses most of the other properties of the Vandermonde matrix. Its rows are derivatives (of some order) of the original Vandermonde rows. There exists an algorithm for the inverse of the confluent Vandermonde matrix that works in quadratic time for every input allowed by the definition.

Another way to derive the above formula is by taking a limit of the Vandermonde matrix as the formula_4&#x27;s approach each other. For example, to get the case of formula_175, take subtract the first row from second in the original Vandermonde matrix, and let formula_176: this yields the corresponding row in the confluent Vandermonde matrix. This derives the generalized interpolation problem with given values and derivatives as a limit of the original case with distinct points: giving formula_177 is similar to giving formula_178 for small formula_179. Geometers have studied the problem of tracking confluent points along their tangent lines, known as compacitification of configuration space.

<doc id="348643" wikidata="Q5426205" url="?curid=348643" title="G-string">
<text>A G-string is a garment consisting of a narrow piece of material that barely covers the genitals, a string-like piece that passes between the buttocks, and a very thin waistband around the hips. There are designs for both women and men. Men&#x27;s G-strings are similar to women&#x27;s but have a front pouch that covers the genitals. G-strings are typically worn as underwear or swimwear or as part of the costume of an exotic dancer.

G-strings are usually made of fabric, lace, leather, or satin. They may serve as a bikini bottoms or they may be worn alone as monokinis or topless swimsuits. G-strings are also worn by go-go dancers.

As underwear, G-strings may be worn in preference to panties to avoid the creation of a visible panty line, or in order to enhance sex appeal.

The two terms &quot;G-string&quot; and &quot;thong&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably; however, technically they refer to different pieces of clothing. G-strings have a thinner back strip than thongs, and usually a thinner waistband. These connectors are often made of string rather than a strip of fabric.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;G-string&quot; is first attested in 1878. It originally denoted the loincloths worn by certain American Indians, and did not come to be used for a type of female undergarment until the 1920s. The significance of the &quot;G&quot; is unclear. It has been suggested that it represents a euphemistic abbreviation of &quot;groin&quot;, or else that it is short for &quot;girdle&quot;; the term &quot;girdle-string&quot; is attested as early as 1846.

== History ==

The G-string first appeared in costumes worn by showgirls in the United States in Earl Carroll&#x27;s productions during the 1920s, a period known as the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties. Before the Great Depression most performers made their own G-strings or bought them from traveling salesmen, but from the 1930s they were usually purchased from commercial manufacturers of burlesque costumes. During the 1930s, the &quot;Chicago G-string&quot; gained prominence when worn by performers like Margie Hart. The Chicago area was the home of some of the largest manufacturers of G-strings and it also became the center of the burlesque shows in the United States. Early performers of color to wear a G-string on stage included the Latina stripper Chiquita Garcia in 1934, and &quot;Princess Whitewing&quot;, a Native American stripper near the end of the decade.

The term &quot;G-string&quot; started to appear in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine during the 1930s. In New York City, G-strings were worn by female dancers at risqué Broadway theatre shows during the Jazz Age. During the 1930s and 1940s, the New York striptease shows in which G-strings were worn were described as &quot;strong&quot;. In shows referred to as &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;sweet&quot; the stripper wore &quot;net panties&quot; instead. &quot;Strong&quot; shows usually took place only when the police were not present, and they became rarer after 1936 when Fiorello H. La Guardia, the Mayor of New York City, organized a series of police raids on burlesque shows and closed strip clubs in the city for the first time in its history. The Mayor also banned showgirls from performing fully nude at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Showgirls sometimes wore flesh-coloured G-strings to give the illusion that they were completely naked.

The American burlesque entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee is popularly associated with the G-string. Her striptease performances often included the wearing of a G-string; in a memoir written by her son Erik Lee Preminger she is described as gluing on a black lace G-string with spirit gum in preparation for a performance.

By the late 1980s G-strings had become widely available in the Western world, and they became increasingly popular during the 1990s. Men&#x27;s G-strings had developed from garments worn by physical culture and bodybuilding models, and in 1994 a men&#x27;s G-string was the best selling design of HOM, a luxury men&#x27;s underwear brand owned by Triumph International. Other underwear brands, such as Sloggi and Jockey International, also introduced men&#x27;s G-strings. In Africa the G-string has become a fashionable item of clothing for young women, and they are often visible above the back of low-rise jeans as a whale tail. As lingerie they are sometimes worn with a babydoll.

In modern strip clubs the strippers often wear G-strings and the customers often give them tips by placing banknotes in their G-strings. The wearing of G-strings in strip clubs is required in some jurisdictions under laws that prohibit public nudity. Some regulations cover the design of G-string allowed. These regulations have in many cases been determined by liquor boards and can differ significantly over a short distance. The constitutional legality of such regulations has been upheld in two cases by the US Supreme Court, when it had to rule on whether First Amendment rights were being infringed.

Disposable G-strings are sometimes worn for modesty when spray tan is being applied at a beauty salon.

<doc id="348644" wikidata="Q333831" url="?curid=348644" title="Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote">
<text>Henry Stafford Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote, (18 November 1846 – 29 September 1911) was a British Conservative politician who served as the third governor-general of Australia, in office from 1904 to 1908. He was previously the governor of Bombay from 1900 to 1903, as well as a government minister under Lord Salisbury.

Northcote was the son of Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh. He was educated at Eton and Merton College, Oxford, and then worked for the Foreign Office and as private secretary to his father. Northcote was elected to the House of Commons in 1880, and served as Financial Secretary to the War Office (1885–86) and Surveyor-General of the Ordnance (1886–88) during Lord Salisbury&#x27;s first and second terms as prime minister. Northcote was made Governor of Bombay in 1900, at which point he was raised to the peerage; he had previously been created a baronet in 1887. He became Governor-General of Australia in 1904, and brought much needed stability to the post – his two predecessors had both resigned after less than two years in office. Northcote played a relatively active role in politics, due to the unstable three-party system then in place. He served for almost five years, resigning in 1908 following a falling-out with Prime Minister Alfred Deakin.

==Background and education==
Northcote was born in London, the second son of the prominent Conservative politician Sir Stafford Northcote, later first Earl of Iddesleigh, by his wife Cecilia Frances, daughter of Thomas Farrer and sister of Thomas Farrer, 1st Baron Farrer. He was educated at Eton and Merton College, Oxford (B.A. 1869; M.A. 1873), and then joined the Foreign Office as a diplomat.

==Diplomatic and political career==
===Early career===
Northcote was secretary to the British delegation negotiating the Alabama Claims between 1871 and 1873. From 1877 to 1880 he was private secretary to his father, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1880 he was elected to the House of Commons as MP for Exeter, a seat he held until 1899. He served under Lord Salisbury as Financial Secretary to the War Office between 1885 and 1886 and as Surveyor-General of the Ordnance between 1886 and 1888, when that office was abolished. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1880 and created a Baronet, of Seamore Place in the Parish of St George, Hanover Square, in the County of Middlesex, in 1887. On his resignation after 20 years as MP, in January 1900 he was presented with the Freedom of the City of Exeter.

===Governor of Bombay===
Northcote was appointed Governor of Bombay in November 1899, through the influence of his father-in-law, Lord Mount Stephen. He visited Queen Victoria at Osborne and kissed hands upon his appointment in early January 1900, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Northcote, of the City and County of the City of Exeter, on 22 January 1900. Lord and Lady Northcote left London in late January, and arrived in Bombay the following month, where he took up the position of Governor on 17 February 1900 and was appointed a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (GCIE) on the same day.

===Governor-General of Australia===

Northcote was still Governor of Bombay when the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, offered him the post of Governor-General of Australia in 1903. The first two Governors-General, Lord Hopetoun and Lord Tennyson, had served shortened terms and had had difficult relations with Australian ministers. Both the British and Australian governments wanted stability and continuity, and Northcote was appointed for a five-year term. His lifelong experience in politics and his time in Bombay made him a suitable appointment. He was neither as imperious as Hopetoun nor as stuffy as Tennyson, and he made a good impression with both politicians and the public.

This was just as well, because Northcote was the first Australian Governor-General to have to deal with political instability. In doing this, he sought the advice of the Chief Justice of the newly created High Court of Australia, Sir Samuel Griffith. In April 1904 the Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin, resigned, and was succeeded in quick succession by the Labor leader Chris Watson, the Free Trade leader George Reid and then Deakin again. Both Watson and Reid asked Northcote to dissolve Parliament before their resignations, and in both cases he refused. At this time no-one doubted that the Governor-General had a discretion in these cases. It is a measure of Northcote&#x27;s standing that all these leaders respected his decisions.

Like his predecessors, Northcote saw himself as a diplomatic representative of the British government as well a vice-regal representative. He was actively involved in negotiations between the British and Australian governments over contentious trade and shipping issues, although his role diminished after 1906 when the Liberal Party came to power in Britain, cutting off much of his influence in London.

In 1907 Northcote and Deakin had a falling-out when the Governor-General, on instructions from London, declined to give his royal assent to a bill restricting appeals from the Australian courts to the Privy Council in London. Deakin, although a loyal Imperialist, believed that Australian parliaments should be sovereign in Australia, and bluntly told Northcote so. This prompted Northcote to announce in February 1908 that he wished to resign, a year early. He left Australia in September. He had been made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1904 and in 1909 he was sworn of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

==Personal life==

Lord Northcote married in 1873 to Alice, adopted daughter of George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen &quot;the richest man in Canada&quot;. There were no children from the marriage. Lady Northcote was created a Companion of the Order of the Crown of India (CI) when her husband became Governor of Bombay in 1900 and a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1919.

He was a Provincial Grand Master for Devon in the Masonic United Grand Lodge of England.

Northcote&#x27;s health declined after his return to Britain from Australia and he died on 29 September 1911, aged 64. The barony became extinct on his death.
Lady Northcote died in June 1934.

<text>Harambee is a Kenyan tradition of community self-help events, e.g. fundraising or development activities. The word means &quot;all pull together&quot; in Swahili, and is the official motto of Kenya, appearing on its coat of arms.

Harambee events may range from informal affairs lasting a few hours, in which invitations are spread by word of mouth, to formal, multi-day events advertised in newspapers. These events have long been important in parts of East Africa, as ways to build and maintain communities.

== History ==
Following Kenya&#x27;s independence in 1963, the first Prime Minister, and later first President of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta adopted &quot;Harambee&quot; as a concept of pulling the country together to build a new nation. He encouraged communities to work together to raise funds for all sorts of local projects, pledging that the government would provide their startup costs. Under this system, wealthy individuals wishing to get into politics could donate large amounts of money to local harambee drives, thereby gaining legitimacy; however, such practices were never institutionalised during Kenyatta&#x27;s presidency.

==Etymology==

The etymology of the term is unclear, but has been cited as genuinely Bantu. It is thought to have been first used by Swahili porters when lifting heavy loads and was originally spelt &quot;Halambee&quot;. However, according to a folk etymology, the word is said to have originated from Indian labourers responsible for building the Uganda Railway. According to this account, the labourers would invoke Hare, the divine energy of God, and Ambe, a Hindu goddess, during the construction.

==Criticism==

===Religious criticism===
Kenyan Christians have criticised the use of the word &quot;harambee&quot; as an official term due to its alleged Hindu origin. This objection has been dismissed as being offensive to the country&#x27;s Hindu community, and also on the basis that even if the supposed derivation from &quot;hare Ambeh&quot; (hail Ambeh) were true, it has become irrelevant to the term&#x27;s modern usage and meaning.

===Attempted replacement===
In January 2002, the Risk Advisory Group Ltd commissioned by President Moi&#x27;s administration as part of the anti-corruption efforts recommended the abolition of harambee, or the spirit of pulling together.

In 2003 when the National Rainbow Coalition NARC took over from the Kenya African National Union KANU, President Mwai Kibaki enacted the Public Officers Ethics Act which prohibited members of parliament and cabinet secretaries from presiding over harambee events.

In February 2018, a petition was presented to the Kenyan parliament and senate, seeking to have the word &quot;harambee&quot; removed from the coat of arms on the claim that it represents a Hindu goddess. The petition was rejected on the grounds that it would be discriminatory towards Hindus and the Hindi language, that the word &quot;Harambee&quot; is internationally recognised, and that the cost incurred in changing the coat of arms would be significant.

<text>Joseph Anthony Capstick (27 July 1944 – 23 October 2003) was an English comedian, actor, musician and broadcaster.

==Life and career==
First son of Joe Capstick, a wireless operator in the RAF, and his wife, June, née Duncan, he was born in Rotherham, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, and spent most of his childhood in Swinton, near Mexborough. For over thirty years he was a presenter on BBC Radio Sheffield. In the 1970s he presented &quot;Folkweave&quot; for BBC Radio 2 and continued to work for that station sporadically until the early 1990s. Outside Sheffield, he is perhaps better known as one of the policemen in the long-running British sitcom, &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, where he played the role until his death in October 2003, with his final appearance on the show broadcast in April 2004.

==Biography==

A regular performer on the folk circuit, he recorded many albums. The first was for the Newcastle based record label Rubber Records (&quot;His Round&quot; with Hedgehog Pie, &quot;Punch and Judy Man&quot;, &quot;Tony Capstick Does a Turn&quot;, &quot;Songs of Ewan MacColl&quot; with Dick Gaughan and Dave Burland and &quot;There Was This Bloke&quot; with Mike Harding, Derek Brimstone and Bill Barclay). In 1981, he unexpectedly reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;The Sheffield Grinder&quot; / &quot;Capstick Comes Home&quot;. It was recorded with the Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band. His recitation, &quot;Capstick Comes Home&quot;, was based on the well-known Hovis wholemeal bread television commercials directed by Ridley Scott. &quot;Capstick Comes Home&quot; also peaked at number 92 in Australia in July 1981.

As a comedian, he had an eight-part television series, &quot;Capstick&#x27;s Capers&quot;, on Channel 4 in 1983. Capstick was also a prolific bit-part actor, with a career including minor roles in the soap operas &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. In the latter he played the recurring character of the brewer Harvey Nuttall.

His career at Radio Sheffield came to an end in January 2003. He continued to write a regular column in a local weekly newspaper, the &quot;Rotherham Advertiser&quot;.

Capstick was an author, with Paul Donoghue, of a book on the Appleby Horse Fair.

==Death==
On 23 October 2003, Capstick was found dead at his cottage in Hoober, near Wentworth, South Yorkshire, he had suffered an aneurysm following a bout of pneumonia. He was survived by wife Gillian and his two children from his first marriage.

<doc id="348668" wikidata="Q7893835" url="?curid=348668" title="Unity of the proposition">
<text>In philosophy, the unity of the [[proposition]] is the problem of explaining how a sentence in the indicative mood expresses more than just what a list of proper names expresses.

== History ==

The problem was discussed under this name by Bertrand Russell, but can be traced back to Plato. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Sophist&quot;, the simplest kind of sentence consists of just a proper name and a universal term (i.e. a predicate). The name refers to or picks out some individual object, and the predicate then says something about that individual.

The difficulty is to explain how the predicate does this. If, as Plato thinks, the predicate is the name of some universal concept or form, how do we explain how the sentence comes to be true or false? If, for example, &quot;Socrates is wise&quot; consists of just a name for Socrates, and a name for the universal concept of Wisdom, how could the sentence be true &quot;or&quot; false? In either case, the &quot;Socrates&quot; signifies Socrates, and the predicate signifies Wisdom. But the sentence &quot;asserts&quot; that Socrates is wise. The assertion of wisdom must consist in the assertion of some relation between Socrates and Wisdom. What is this relation?

The problem was discussed much later by Francis Bradley. If we assume that a sentence consists of two objects and a relation that connects them, and we represent this by three names, say John, loving, Mary, how do we express the fact that John loves Mary? For &quot;John&quot;, &quot;loving&quot; and &quot;Mary&quot; would name the objects they do, even if this were not a fact. This is known as Bradley&#x27;s regress.

== Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein ==

The problem became significant in the early development of set theory. Set membership is a formal representation of the relation between the two parts of the proposition, and there are certain philosophical problems connected with this, as Frege realised when he investigated the distinction between concept and object. Assume that &quot;Shergar is a horse&quot; analyses into what &quot;Shergar&quot; names (an &quot;Object&quot;, according to Frege), and what &quot;is a horse&quot; names (a &quot;Concept&quot;). Objects are fundamentally different from concepts, otherwise we get the problem of the unity of the proposition. A predicate cannot function as the subject of a sentence. But what are we doing when we talk about the concept &quot;is a horse&quot;? Aren&#x27;t we using the expression &quot;the concept &quot;is a horse&quot;&quot;, and isn&#x27;t that a subject expression, which refers (on Frege&#x27;s account) to an Object? Yes, says Frege, and on that account the concept &quot;is a horse&quot; is not a concept at all. This is a dogma that even Frege&#x27;s most faithful followers found difficult to swallow.

The difficulty was discussed in detail in &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; by Russell, who saw no resolution.

:There appears to be an ultimate notion of assertion, given by the verb, which is lost as soon as we substitute a verbal noun, and is lost when the proposition in question is made the subject of some other proposition. ...Thus the contradiction which was to have been avoided, of an entity which cannot be made a logical subject, appears to have here become inevitable. This difficulty, which seems to be inherent in the very nature of truth and falsehood, is one with which I do not know how to deal with satisfactorily. ...I therefore leave this question to the logicians with the above brief indication of a difficulty. (§ 52)

Consider e.g. &quot;A differs from B&quot;. The constituents of this proposition are simply A, difference and B. The proposition relates A and B, using the words &quot;is ... from&quot; in &quot;A is different from B&quot;. But if we represent this contribution by words for relations, as e.g. &quot;A &lt;R&gt; difference &lt;R&gt; B&quot; we are back to a list of terms, we are essentially back at Bradley&#x27;s regress.
: A proposition, in fact, is essentially a &quot;unity&quot;, and when analysis has destroyed the unity, no enumeration of constituents will restore the proposition. The verb, when used as a verb, embodies the unity of the proposition, and is thus distinguishable from the verb considered as a term, though I do not know how to give a clear account of the distinction. (§ 52)

Ludwig Wittgenstein addresses the problem early on in the &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;. In section 2.01 he claims that &quot;states of affairs&quot; are combinations of objects. In section 2.03 he explains that nothing is needed to link the objects, since the objects &quot;hang together&quot;. The arrangement of words that in the sentence corresponds to the arrangement or &quot;structure&quot; of objects in the state of affairs expressed by the sentence. This is the so-called picture theory of the proposition.

<doc id="348670" wikidata="Q780868" url="?curid=348670" title="Austin-Healey Sprite">
<text>The Austin-Healey Sprite is a small open sports car produced in the United Kingdom from 1958 until 1971. The Sprite was announced to the press in Monte Carlo by the British Motor Corporation on 20 May 1958, two days after that year&#x27;s Monaco Grand Prix. It was intended to be a low-cost model that &quot;a chap could keep in his bike shed&quot;, yet be the successor to the sporting versions of the pre-war Austin Seven. The Sprite was designed by the Donald Healey Motor Company, with production being undertaken at the MG factory at Abingdon. It first went on sale for £669, using a tuned version of the Austin A-Series engine and as many other components from existing cars as possible to keep costs down.

When the Mk. II Sprite was introduced in 1961 it was joined by a badge-engineered MG version, the Midget, reviving a model name used by MG from the late 1920s through to the mid-1950s. Enthusiasts often refer to these later Sprites and Midgets collectively as &quot;Spridgets.&quot; The MG-badged version of the car continued in production for several years after the Austin-Healey brand ceased to exist.
==Mark I==
The Sprite quickly became affectionately known as the &quot;frogeye&quot; in the UK and the &quot;bugeye&quot; in the US, because its headlights were prominently mounted on top of the bonnet, inboard of the front wings. The car&#x27;s designers had intended that the headlights could be retracted, with the lenses facing skyward when not in use; a similar arrangement was used many years later on the Porsche 928. However, cost-cutting by BMC led to the flip-up mechanism being deleted. Therefore, the headlights were simply fixed in a permanently upright position, giving the car its distinctive &quot;cute&quot; feature. The body was styled by Gerry Coker, with subsequent alterations by Les Ireland following Coker&#x27;s emigration to the US in 1957. The car&#x27;s distinctive frontal styling bore a strong resemblance to the defunct American 1951 Crosley Super Sport. A total of 48,987 &quot;frogeye&quot; Sprites were made.
The problem of providing a rigid structure to an open-topped sports car was resolved by Barry Bilbie, Healey&#x27;s chassis designer, who adapted the idea provided by the Jaguar D-type, with rear suspension forces routed through the bodyshell&#x27;s floor pan. The Sprite&#x27;s chassis design was the world&#x27;s first volume-production sports car to use unitary construction, where the sheet metal body panels (apart from the bonnet) take many of the structural stresses. The original metal gauge (thickness of steel) of the rear structure specified by Bilbie was reduced by the Austin Design Office during prototype build, however during testing at MIRA (Motor Industry Research Association) distortion and deformation of the rear structure occurred and the original specification was reinstated. The two front chassis legs projecting forward from the passenger compartment mean the shell is not a full monocoque. The front sheet-metal assembly, including the bonnet (hood) and wings, was a one-piece unit, hinged from the back, that swung up to allow access to the engine compartment.

The 43 bhp, 948 cc OHV engine (coded 9CC) was derived from the Austin A35 and Morris Minor 1000 models, also BMC products, but upgraded with twin 1 inch SU carburettors. The rack and pinion steering was derived from the Morris Minor 1000 and the front suspension from the Austin A35. The front suspension was a coil spring and wishbone arrangement, with the arm of the Armstrong lever shock absorber serving as the top suspension link. The rear axle was both located and sprung by quarter-elliptic leaf springs, again with lever-arm shock absorbers and top links. The road wheels were 13&quot; and all cars were invariably fitted with Dunlop crossply tyres, usually their Gold Seal model in the 5.20x13 size, although later frogeyes shipped to North America wore 5.60x13 Dunlop crossplies. There were no exterior door handles – the driver and passenger were required to reach inside to open the door. There was also no boot lid, owing to the need to retain as much structural integrity as possible, and access to the spare wheel and luggage compartment was achieved by tilting the seat-backs forward and reaching under the rear deck, a process likened to potholing by many owners, as the space available was dark but cavernous.

Engine:

* 1958–1961: 948 cc A-Series I4, 43 hp (32 kW) at 5200 rpm and 52 lbf·ft (71 Nm) at 3300 rpm

A car was tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1958. It had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 20.5 seconds. Fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £678, including taxes of £223.

The BMC Competitions Department entered Austin Healey Sprites in major international races and rallies, their first major success coming when John Sprinzel and Willy Cave won their class on the 1958 Alpine Rally. In 1959, the Sprite was introduced to the US market by winning its class in the 12-hour race at Sebring, Florida. Private competitors also competed with much success in Sprites. Because of its affordability and practicality, the Austin-Healey Sprite was developed into a formidable competition car, assuming many variants by John Sprinzel, Speedwell and WSM. Many owners use their Austin Healey Sprites in competition today, fifty years after its introduction.

==Mark II==
The Mark II announced at the end of May 1961 used the same 948 cc engine (engine code 9CG), but with larger twin 1 inch SU carburettors, increasing power to 46.5 bhp. A close-ratio gearbox was fitted. The bodywork was completely revamped, with the headlights migrating to a more conventional position in the wings, either side of a full-width grille and a conventional bonnet. At the rear, styling borrowed from the soon-to-be-announced MGB gave a similarly more modern look, with the added advantages of an opening boot lid and conventional rear bumper bar. The addition of the boot lid required the introduction of squared-off rear wheel arches to retain enough metal in the rear structure to give good rigidity. The result was a much less eccentric-looking sports car, though at the expense of some 100 lbs extra weight. In contrast to the &#x27;frogeye&#x27;, the later cars are often collectively referred to as square-bodied Sprites by enthusiasts.

An MG version of the car was introduced in May 1961 as &#x27;the new Midget,&#x27; reviving a model name which had been a great success for the MG Car Company in the 1930s and again as the T-type Midget in the period from 1945 to 1955. The Midget was to prove more popular with the public than the Sprite and by 1972 had completely supplanted it within the BMC range. In October 1962, both Sprites and Midgets were given a long-stroke 1098 cc engine (engine code 10CG), which was also fitted in single carburettor form to the Austin A40 and Morris Minor 1000 (which nevertheless remained the Minor 1000). A strengthened gearbox with Porsche (baulk-ring) synchromesh was introduced to cope with the extra power – 56 bhp. Front disc brakes were also introduced at the same time and wire wheels became an option. 31,665 Mark II Sprites were made.

Innocenti also produced their own version of the Sprite, using the standard production underframe (initially shipped out from England), but with Italian styling by the American Tom Tjaarda, then working at Carrozzeria Ghia. The Innocenti 950 spider and later 1100 spider were produced from 1961 until 1968.

A car with hardtop tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1961 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 20.0 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car, which was to de-luxe specification cost £705 including taxes of £208.

Engines:
* 1961–1964: 948 cc &quot;A-Series&quot; I4, 46 hp (34 kW) at 5500 rpm and 53 lbf·ft (72 Nm) at 3000 rpm
* 1962–1964: 1098 cc &quot;A-Series&quot; I4, 56 hp (42 kW) at 5500 rpm and 62 lbf·ft (84 Nm) at 3250 rpm
==Mark III==

The Sprite Mark III was announced in March 1964. It was also marketed as the MG Midget Mark II. Differences between the two were again restricted to minor trim detailing. Although still 1098 cc, the engine had a stronger block casting, and the size of the crankshaft main bearings was increased to two inches (engine code 10CC). 

A new (slightly) curved-glass windscreen was introduced with hinged quarterlights and wind-up side windows. Exterior door handles were provided for the first time, with separate door locks. Though the car could now be secured, with a soft-top roof the added protection was limited. The rear suspension was modified from quarter-elliptic to semi-elliptic leaf springs, which gave a more comfortable ride for a near-negligible weight penalty as well as providing additional axle location, the upper links fitted to the quarter-elliptic models being deleted. Though scarcely sybaritic, these changes helped the Sprite and Midget compete with the recently released Triumph Spitfire. 25,905 Mark III Sprites were made.

Engine:
* 1964–66: 1098 cc &quot;A-Series&quot; I4, 59 hp (44 kW) at 5750 rpm and 65 lbf·ft (88 Nm) at 3500 rpm
==Mark IV and Austin Sprite==

The next upgrade was presented at the London Motor Show in October 1966. Besides receiving the larger 1275 cc engine (which disappointed enthusiasts by being in a lower state of tune than that of the Mini-Cooper &#x27;S&#x27;), the Mark IV and its cousin the Mark III MG Midget had several changes which were more than cosmetic. Most notable is the change from a removable convertible top, which had to be stowed in the boot, to a permanently affixed, folding top of greatly improved design, which was much easier to use. Separate brake and clutch master cylinders were fitted, as car manufacturers&#x27; thoughts began to turn to making their products safer. On US market versions the larger engine sacrificed some of its performance from 1968 on, through the use of smog pumps and other modifications to comply with federal emission control requirements. 1969 was the final year the Sprite was exported to the US. At the same time reversing lamps were made a standard fitment and the cars&#x27; electrical system was switched to negative earth and powered by an alternator rather than a dynamo. This was also the first year that reclining seats were fitted.

A facelift was carried out for the 1970 model year (beginning in September 1969) after Austin-Healey (and MG) became part of British Leyland. These largely cosmetic revision were to update the appearance of the car (now 10 years old) and minimise the difference between the Sprite and Midget versions to reduce production costs; both cars now had the same cosmetic features, differing only in their badges. Alongside a new range of body colours, both cars now had the same grille, based on the plainer square-mesh design of the MkII-onwards Sprite but now finished in satin black with the addition of a chrome embellisher. The body sills were painted satin black with a chrome strip between them and the upper bodywork and the name &quot;SPRITE&quot; was applied in chrome capital letters on the sill just behind the front wheelarch (MG Midgets had their own badge in the same style). Slimmer bumpers were fitted, with those at the rear changing to two quarter-bumpers with the gap in the middle filled by a square number plate. Rubber-capped overriders were standard fitment front and rear. The seats were now a slimmer, flatter design with a more modern upholstery pattern. Some body colours could now be ordered with the option of the seats, door trim and floor carpets in beige rather than the standard black. 1970-model year Sprites were fitted with new cast-alloy looking ventilated wheels although they were still made of steel although the option for wire-spoke wheels remained. As launched the 1970 Sprites had their windscreen frames and windscreen wiper arms painted &#x27;anti-dazzle&#x27; matt black as was popular on modern American muscle cars and rally cars of the era but these features were expensive to produce and unpopular with buyers so only around 20 cars were produced before these reverted to the original polished metal appearance. 22,790 Mark IV Sprites were made.

Engine:
* 1966–1971: 1275 cc &quot;A-Series&quot; I4, 65 hp (48 kW) at 6000 rpm and 72 lbf·ft (98 Nm) at 3000 rpm

The Healey connection was discontinued in 1971, so the final 1,022 Sprites built were simply Austin Sprites. This was a cost-cutting move of Donald Stokes&#x27;, enabling British Leyland to stop paying royalties to the Donald Healey Motor Company. There was no direct successor, as BL&#x27;s extensive range already contained the MG Midget, which was identical to the Sprite except for badging, and the similarly dimensioned and priced Triumph Spitfire.

==Competition==

The Sprite (and its MG Midget sibling) have been successful club level race cars since their launch and continue to race in various events to the present day. International events were entered throughout the 1960s and surprisingly good results were achieved, including a 12th-place finish at Le Mans in 1965. The works cars began with use of a commercially available fibreglass-bodied Sprite (with a Falcon body) before utilising lightweight body panels of standard appearance. By the mid-60s, use was made of the wind-tunnel at Longbridge. Barry Bilbie (the chassis designer) utilised the results to produce a streamlined body, built in Birmabright alloy at Healey&#x27;s Warwick workshops by Bill Buckingham and Terry Westwood. These cars were powered by BMC&#x27;s Courthouse Green&#x27;s tuned engines and eventually produced a reliable 110 bhp, which enabled a top speed of around 150 mph on the Mulsanne Straight. One-off gearboxes were also made at Courthouse Green, with MGB gearboxes modified with an externally mounted 5th gear and overdrive in some cases. BMC works entries recorded class wins at Sebring with drivers including Stirling Moss, Bruce McLaren and Steve McQueen, as well as competing in the Targa Florio and Mugello sports car races.

==Australian production==
Sprites were imported into Australia in completely knocked down (CKD) kit form and assembled by the Pressed Metal Corporation at Enfield, in New South Wales. Models assembled in Australia included the Mk 1, 2, 2A, 3 and 3A.

==Innocenti Spider and C Coupé==

At the 1960 Turin Auto Show, BMC&#x27;s Italian partner Innocenti showed a small Spider built upon Sprite underpinnings. The car was the first design of Tom Tjaarda&#x27;s, drawn for Carrozzeria Ghia. Ghia&#x27;s partner firm OSI built the bodyshells, when the car entered production in early 1961. The original Innocenti 950 Spider had the Frogeye&#x27;s 948 cc engine with , 624 of these were built. Later in 1961 an uprated was installed. In February 1963 the 1098 cc &quot;S&quot; model was introduced, this also had front disc brakes to cope with the extra power. The 1100 has and could also be fitted with a removable hardtop. The Spider wasn&#x27;t a mere reshelling, as the entire bulkhead was moved forward to provide longer doors and a more modern look. Unlike the spartan Frogeye, the Spider also had wind-up windows. 4,790 of the 950 Spiders were built, and 2,074 of the 1100 cc Spiders.
The Innocenti Spider originally sold well in Italy, with production running at 13 cars per day in 1962, but it had a hard time competing against the cheaper Sprite in export markets. As more modern competitors arrived and as the British-built Sprite was modernised, sales dropped precipitously, with only 63 cars built in 1965. Thus, Innocenti presented the reworked Innocenti Coupé in September 1966, still with the same 1100 engine as seen in late Spiders. The badging on the car simply read &quot;Innocenti C&quot;. The Coupé&#x27;s all-new bodywork designed by Sergio Sartorelli was wider and longer than the Spider&#x27;s, and the wheelbase was extended by 150 mm to . The floorpan was reworked to allow for the seats to be mounted lower than in a Sprite, making the cabin less cramped. It was competitively priced in the Italian market, slotting nicely between the smaller Fiat 850 Coupé and the bigger Fiat 124 Sport Spider. Only 794 were built when production ended in 1968. 
==Lenham GT Coupe ==

The Lenham Motor Company of Kent, founded in 1960, was, and still is, one of the once many &quot;cottage industry&quot; automotive companies providing specialist conversions based upon commercial brand platforms. Best known for its Spridget coupé conversions and the big-Healey based Lenham Healey (a replica of the Healey Silverstone), the firm also produced hard-tops for Jaguar E-types, Triumphs, the Jensen-Healey, the Lotus Elan and for the MGB.

==Tifosi Rana Frogeye Replica==

The Tifosi Rana Frogeye Sprite replica retains a significant amount of the character and appeal of the original version by using the MG Midget as its basis. As the MG Midget traces its roots directly back to the original Austin Healey ‘Frogeye’, the Tifosi replica perhaps merits the sobriquet &quot;Spridget&quot; even more than the originals. They are supplied and/or built by Halls Garage near Bourne in Lincolnshire, home of the now defunct BRM Formula 1 racing cars.

The Tifosi Rana replica has a fibreglass body with upgrades such as external door handles and wind-up windows as standard. A &quot;Custom package&quot; allows a purchaser to specify various choices of engine, transmission suspension, paint and trim.

===The Frogeye Car Company===
Keith Brading started Frogeye Car company on the Isle of Wight in the 1980s. The first examples of these cars were restoration kits which used a ladder frame chassis to do away with the often rusted-out original body shell. Brading was known to Geoffrey Healey through a mutual friend and because he, at one stage, owned the two prototype 3000 coupes.

Geoffrey Healey notes that Brading&#x27;s re-design of the &quot;Frogeye&quot; was shortly to receive approval from Donald Healey, calling the concept &quot;brilliant&quot;, and after some modifications, &quot;just the vehicle to carry the Healey approval&quot;.

The last sports car to have his father&#x27;s approval benefited from Geoffrey Healey&#x27;s direct input until his unexpected death in 1994 and the car he used is still owned by Keith Brading. Another “engineering superstar” who also contributed to the Healey Frogeye development was John Ackroyd who designed Thrust2, which held the world land speed record from 4 October 1983 to 25 September 1997.

The Frogeye Car Company was a sideline to Keith Brading&#x27;s main business, and no cars have been manufactured since 1998.

==UK 50th anniversary celebration==
On 24 May 2008, the official UK golden anniversary of the introduction of the Austin Healey Sprite, &quot;Spridget 50The Big Party&quot; was held at the British Heritage Motor Centre at Gaydon, Warwickshire. Up to 1000 Sprites, Midgets and derivatives were in attendancea record number. The event was jointly organised and promoted by the UK&#x27;s Midget and Sprite Club, Healey Drivers Club, MG Owners Club, Austin Healey Club and MG Car Clubthe first time an event of this size has been supported by all of the marque-representing clubs.

<doc id="348674" wikidata="Q1089579" url="?curid=348674" title="Grand Prix motor racing">
<text>Grand Prix motor racing, a form of motorsport competition, has its roots in organised automobile racing that began in France as early as 1894. It quickly evolved from simple road races from one town to the next, to endurance tests for car and driver. Innovation and the drive of competition soon saw speeds exceeding , but because early races took place on open roads, accidents occurred frequently, resulting in deaths both of drivers and of spectators. A common abbreviation used for Grand Prix racing is &quot;GP&quot; or &quot;GP racing&quot;.

Grand Prix motor racing eventually evolved into formula racing, with Formula One considered its direct descendant. Each event of the Formula One World Championships is still called a &quot;Grand Prix&quot;; Formula One is also referred to as &quot;Grand Prix racing&quot;. Some IndyCar championship races are also called &quot;Grands Prix&quot;.

== Origins of organized racing ==
Motor racing was started in France, as a direct result of the enthusiasm with which the French public embraced the motor car. Manufacturers were enthusiastic due to the possibility of using motor racing as a shop window for their cars. The first motoring contest took place on July 22, 1894, and was organised by a Paris newspaper, . The Paris–Rouen rally was , from Porte Maillot in Paris, through the Bois de Boulogne, to Rouen. Count Jules-Albert de Dion was first into Rouen after 6 hours 48 minutes at an average speed of . He finished 3 minutes 30 seconds ahead of Albert Lemaître (Peugeot), followed by Auguste Doriot (Peugeot, 16 minutes 30 seconds back), René Panhard (Panhard, 33 minutes 30 seconds back), and Émile Levassor (Panhard, 55 minutes 30 seconds back). The official winners were Peugeot and Panhard as cars were judged on their speed, handling and safety characteristics, and De Dion&#x27;s steam car needed a stoker which the judges deemed to be outside of their objectives.

In 1900, James Gordon Bennett, Jr., the owner of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; and the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, established the Gordon Bennett Cup. He hoped the creation of an international event would drive automobile manufacturers to improve their cars. Each country was allowed to enter up to three cars, which had to be fully built in the country that they represented and entered by that country&#x27;s automotive governing body. International racing colours were established in this event. The 1903 event occurred in the aftermath of the fatalities at the Paris-Madrid road race, so the race, at Athy in Ireland, though on public roads, was run over a closed circuit: the first ever closed-circuit motor race.

In the United States, William Kissam Vanderbilt II launched the Vanderbilt Cup at Long Island, New York in 1904.

== First Grands Prix ==
Some anglophone sources wrongly list a race called the in 1901. This may stem from a mistranslation of the contemporary French sources such as the magazine of March 1901. The name of the 1901 event was the and it was run in three classes around the streets of Pau. The was the name of the prizes awarded for the lesser classes (&#x27;Light cars&#x27; and &#x27;Voiturettes&#x27;). The was the name of the prize awarded for the &#x27;Heavy&#x27; (fastest) class. Thus Maurice Farman was awarded the for his overall victory in the driving a Panhard 24 hp.

In Pierre Souvestre described the 1901 event as: &quot;in the &quot;Circuit du Sud-Ouest&quot;, at the meeting in Pau&quot; ().

===First Grand Prix and the ===

The only race at the time to regularly carry the name Grand Prix was organised by the Automobile Club de France (ACF), of which the first took place in 1906. The circuit used, which was based in Le Mans, was roughly triangular in shape, each lap covering . Six laps were to run each day, and each lap took approximately an hour using the relatively primitive cars of the day. The driving force behind the decision to race on a circuit – as opposed to racing on ordinary roads from town to town – was the Paris to Madrid road race of 1903. During this race a number of people, both drivers and pedestrians – including Marcel Renault – were killed and the race was stopped by the French authorities at Bordeaux. Further road based events were banned.

From the 32 entries representing 12 different automobile manufacturers, at the 1906 event, the Hungarian-born Ferenc Szisz (1873–1944) won the race in a Renault. This race was regarded as the first , which meant &quot;great trial&quot; and the term was used from then on to denote up to the eight most important events of the year.

Races in this period were heavily nationalistic affairs, with a few countries setting up races of their own, but no formal championship tying them together. The rules varied from country to country and race to race, and typically centred on maximum (not minimum) weights in an effort to limit power by limiting engine size indirectly (10–15 L engines were quite common, usually with no more than four cylinders, and producing less than 50 hp). The cars all had mechanics on board as well as the driver, and no one was allowed to work on the cars during the race except for these two. A key factor to Renault winning this first Grand Prix was held to be the detachable wheel rims (developed by Michelin), which allowed tire changes to occur without having to lever the tire and tube off and back on the rim. Given the state of the roads, such repairs were frequent. Early Grand Prix cars could be technically innovative, with marques such as Peugeot using technology that would later become more widespread.

===Political numbering and renaming===
A further historic confusion arose in the early 1920s when the Automobile Club de France attempted to pull off a retrospective political trick by numbering and renaming the major races held in France before the 1906 French Grand Prix as being , despite their running pre-dating the formation of the Club. Hence, the 1895 Paris–Bordeaux–Paris Trail was renamed ; and the true first Grand Prix in 1906 race was renamed the (9th). The ACF used this numbering in 1933, although some members of the Club dismissed it, &quot;concerned the name of the Club was lent to the fiction simply out of a childish desire to establish their Grand Prix as the oldest race in the world&quot;.

== Racecourse development ==

For the most part, races were run over a lengthy circuit of closed public roads, not purpose-built private tracks. This was true of the Le Mans circuit of the 1906 &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, as well as the (run on of Sicilian roads), the German circuit in the Taunus mountains, and the French circuit at Dieppe (a mere ), used for the 1907 Grand Prix. The exceptions were the steeply banked egg-shaped near oval of Brooklands in England, completed in 1907; the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, first used in 1909 with the first Indianapolis 500-Mile Race in 1911; and the , in Italy, opened in 1922.
In 1908, the United States of America became the first country outside France to host an automobile race using the name Grand Prix (or Grand Prize), run at Savannah. The first outside France was the 1921 Italian Grand Prix held at Montichiari. This was quickly followed by Belgium and Spain (in 1924), and later spread to other countries including Britain (1926). Strictly speaking, this still was not a formal championship, but a loose collection of races run to various rules. (A &quot;formula&quot; of rules had appeared just before World War I, finally based on engine size as well as weight, but it was not universally adopted.)

In 1904, many national motor clubs banded together to form the (AIACR). In 1922 the (CSI) was empowered on behalf of AIACR to regulate Grand Prix racing and other forms of international racing. Since the inception of Grand Prix racing, competitions had been run in accordance with a strict formula based on engine size and vehicle weight. These regulations were virtually abandoned in 1928 with an era known as &quot;Formula Libre&quot; when race organisers decided to run their events with almost no limitations. From 1927 to 1934, the number of races considered to have Grand Prix status exploded, jumping from five events in 1927, to nine events in 1929, to eighteen in 1934 (the peak year before World War II).

During this period a lot of changes of rules occurred. There was a mass start for the first time at the 1922 French Grand Prix in Strasbourg. The 1925 season was the first season during which no riding mechanic was required in a car, as this rule was repealed in Europe after the death of Tom Barrett during the 1924 Grand Prix season. At the in 1926 a well thought-out system, with flags and boards, giving drivers tactical information, was used for the first time by Alfred Neubauer, the racing manager of the Mercedes-Benz team. The 1933 Monaco Grand Prix was the first time in the history of the sport that the grid was determined by timed qualifying rather than the luck of a draw.

== The Pre-WWII years ==
All the competing vehicles were painted in the international auto racing colors:
*blue (Bleu de France) for France,
*green (British racing green) for Britain,
*red (Rosso corsa) for Italy,
*white for Germany,
**Note: beginning in 1934, the Germans stopped painting their cars, allegedly after the paint had been left off a Mercedes-Benz W25 in an effort to reduce weight. The unpainted metal soon had the German vehicles dubbed by the media as the &quot;Silver Arrows&quot;. However, there are conflicting versions of how German Grand Prix cars came to be unpainted. Photos exist of unpainted Mercedes and Auto Union cars as early as 1932.
*yellow for Belgium.

French cars continued to dominate (led by Bugatti, but also including Delage and Delahaye) until the late 1920s, when the Italians (Alfa Romeo and Maserati) began to beat the French cars regularly. At the time, the Germans engineered unique race vehicles as seen in the photo here with the Benz aerodynamic &quot;teardrop&quot; body introduced at the 1923 European Grand Prix at Monza by Karl Benz.

In the 1930s, however, nationalism entered a new phase when the Nazis encouraged Mercedes and Auto Union to further the glory of the Reich. (The government did provide some money to the two manufacturers, but the extent of the aid into their hands was exaggerated in the media; government subsidies amounted to perhaps 10% or less of the costs of running the two racing teams.) The two German marques utterly dominated the period from 1935 to 1939, winning all but three of the official Championship Grands Prix races run in those years. The cars by this time were single-seaters (the riding mechanic vanished in the early 1920s), with 8 to 16 cylinder supercharged engines producing upwards of on alcohol fuels.

As early as October 1923, the idea of an automobile championship was discussed at the annual autumn conference of the AIACR (Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus) in Paris. However, discussion centered on the increased interest in racing by manufacturers and holding the first European Grand Prix at Monza in 1923. The first World Championship took place in 1925, but it was for manufacturers only, consisting of four races of at least in length. The races that formed the first Constructors&#x27; Championship were the Indianapolis 500, the European Grand Prix, and the French and Italian Grands Prix. This world championship was officially cancelled in 1930, but in 1928–1930 no titles were awarded. Subsequently, a European Championship, consisting of the major Grand Prix in a number of countries (named ) was instituted for drivers in 1931, and was competed every year until the outbreak of World War II in 1939 with the exception of the 1933 and 1934 seasons.

== The post-war years and Formula One ==
In 1946, following World War II, only four races of Grand Prix calibre were held. Rules for a Grand Prix World Championship had been laid out before World War II, but it took several years afterward until 1947 when the old AIACR reorganised itself as the or &quot;FIA&quot; for short, headquartered in Paris. It announced the new International Formula, also known as Formula 1 or Formula A, to be effective from 1947. At the end of the 1949 season the FIA announced that for 1950 they would be linking several national Formula One Grands Prix to create a World Championship for drivers, although due to economic difficulties the years and were actually competed in Formula Two cars. A points system was established and a total of seven races were granted championship status including the Indianapolis 500. The first World Championship race was held on 13 May 1950 at Silverstone in the United Kingdom.

The Italians once again did well in these early World Championship races, both manufacturers and drivers. The first World Champion was Giuseppe Farina, driving an Alfa Romeo. Ferrari appeared at the second World Championship race, in Monaco, and has the distinction of being the only manufacturer to compete in every season of the World Championship, still competing in .

<text>Kubrat (; ) was the ruler of the Onogur–Bulgars, credited with establishing the confederation of Old Great Bulgaria in ca. 632. His name derived from the Turkic words &quot;qobrat&quot; — &quot;to gather&quot;, or &quot;qurt&quot;, i.e. &quot;wolf&quot;.

==Origin==
In the &quot;Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans&quot; Kubrat is mentioned as &quot;Kurt&quot; (), being a member of the Dulo clan and reigning for 60 years having succeeded Gostun of the Ermi clan.

Bulgars were Turkic nomadic people, who participated in the 5th-century Hunnic confederation. Upon Attila&#x27;s death, the tribes that later formed the Bulgars had retreated east into the Black Sea-Caspian Steppe. The western Bulgar tribes joined the Avar Khaganate, while the eastern Bulgars came under the Western Turkic Khaganate by the end of the 6th century.

Theophanes the Confessor called him &quot;king of the Onogundur Huns&quot;. Patriarch Nikephoros I (758–828) called Kubrat &quot;lord of the Onuğundur&quot; and &quot;ruler of the Onuğundur–Bulğars&quot;. John of Nikiu ( 696) called him &quot;chief of the Huns&quot;. D. Hupchick identified Kubrat as &quot;Onogur&quot;, P. Golden as &quot;Oğuro-Bulğar&quot;, H. J. Kim as &quot;Bulgar Hunnic/Hunnic Bulgar&quot;. According to H. J. Kim the Onogundur/Onogur were evidently part of the Bulgar confederation.

==History==
Kubrat spent his early life at the Byzantine Empire imperial palace in Constantinople. As the 7th-century Byzantine historian John of Nikiu narrates:
Whether he was a child or a young adult during his time in Constantinople is unclear. The exact time of this event is also unknown but probably coincided with the reign of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641). His or Organa&#x27;s conversion to Christianity is placed circa 619 AD. It seems that young Kubrat was part of the pre-planned coalition, initiated by Heraclius or Organa, against the Sasanian–Avar alliance. This coincides with other alliances by Heraclius with steppe peoples, all in the interest of saving Constantinople.

Kubrat, in 635, according to Nikephoros I, &quot;ruler of the Onoğundur–Bulğars, successfully revolted against the Avars and concluded a treaty with Heraclius&quot;. The state Old Great Bulgaria (Magna Bulgaria) was formed. Kubrat died &quot;when Konstantinos was in the West&quot;, somewhere during the reign of Constans II (641–668).

According to Nikephoros I, Kubrat instructed his five sons (Batbayan, Kotrag, Asparukh, two others unmentioned are considered to be Kuber and Alcek) to &quot;never separate their place of dwelling from one another, so that by being in concordance with one another, their power might thrive&quot;. However, the loose tribal union broke up under internal tensions and especially Khazars pressure from the East.

== Kubrat&#x27;s death ==
The Pereshchepina Treasure was discovered in 1912 by Ukrainian peasants in the vicinity of Poltava, in village Malo Pereshchepyne. It consists of diverse gold and silver objects of total weight of over 50 kg from the migration period, including three rings with monograms, which led scholars to identify the site as Kubrat&#x27;s grave. The ring A was inscribed in Greek XOBPATOY and ring C was inscribed XOBPATOY ПATPIKIOY, indicating the dignity of &quot;Patrikios&quot; (Patrician) that he had achieved in the Byzantine world. The treasure indicates close relation between the Bulgars and Byzantines, e.g. the bracelets were influenced or made by a Byzantine goldsmith. The first treasure coins were issued after 629, by Heraclius, and the last c. 650 AD, by Constans II, which can be associated with the upcoming Khazar conquest.

Kubrat is mentioned in the &quot;Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans&quot;, according which his birth is given the sign of the ox (&quot;shegor vechem&quot;) in the Bulgar calendar. It also says his rule was 60 years. Presuming lifespan is meant, this would place his death in 653 or 665 AD. Thus, the date of Kubrat&#x27;s death according historical and archaeological sources is placed between 650 and 665 AD. Correspondingly his birth could have been between 590 and 615 if Somogyi&#x27;s theory is correct.

==Legacy==
Kubrat Knoll on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Kubrat of Great Bulgaria.

Kubrat was portrayed by Vasil Mihaylov in the 1981 Bulgarian movie &quot;Aszparuh&quot;, directed by Ludmil Staikov.

<text>In the field of data warehouses, a document warehouse is a software framework for analysis, sharing, and reuse of unstructured data, such as textual or multimedia documents.
This is different from data warehouses that focuses on structured data, such as tabularized sales reports.

On the other hand, Document Warehouse for SAP is also a FileNet&#x27;s commercial software that enables SAP&#x27;s business applications to access document images stored by FileNet.

<text>St Katharine Docks is a former dock and now a mixed-used district in Central London, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and within the East End. It lies on the north bank of the River Thames, immediately downstream of the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. From 1828 to 1968, it was one of the commercial docks that made up the Port of London. It is in the redevelopment zone known as Docklands and is now a popular housing and leisure complex.

==History==

St Katharine Docks took their name from the former hospital of St Katharine&#x27;s by the Tower, built in the 12th century, which stood on the site. An intensely built-up area, the entire 23-acre (9.5 hectares) Precinct of St Katharine by the Tower and part of East Smithfield, was earmarked for redevelopment by an act of Parliament, the (6 Geo. 4. c. cv), with construction commencing in May 1827. Some 1,250 houses were demolished, together with the medieval hospital of St. Katharine. Around 11,300 inhabitants, mostly port workers crammed into unsanitary slums, lost their homes; only the property owners received compensation. The scheme was designed by engineer Thomas Telford and was his only major project in London. George Turnbull and James Waylen were working for Telford. To create as much quayside as possible, the docks were designed in the form of two linked basins (East and West), both accessed via an entrance lock from the Thames. Steam engines designed by James Watt and Matthew Boulton kept the water level in the basins about four feet above that of the tidal river. By 1830, the docks had cost over £2 million to build.
Telford aimed to minimise the amount of quayside activity and specified that the docks&#x27; warehouses (designed by the architect Philip Hardwick) be built right on the quayside so that goods could be unloaded directly into them.

The docks were officially opened on 25 October 1828. Although well used, they were not a great commercial success and were unable to accommodate large ships. They were amalgamated in 1864 with the neighbouring London Docks. In 1909, the Port of London Authority took over the management of almost all of the Thames docks, including St Katharine Dock. By the 1930s the only regular use was by ships of the General Steam Navigation Company.

St Katharine Docks were badly damaged by German bombing during the Second World War. All the warehouses around the eastern basin were destroyed, and the site they had occupied remained derelict until the 1960s. The dock entrance lock was rebuilt in 1957 but the docks ceased commercial use in 1968. The remaining wharehouses on the western side were demolished to make way for redevelopment.

==Closure and redevelopment==

Because of their very restricted capacity and inability to cope with large modern ships, the St Katharine Docks were among the first to be closed in 1968, and were sold to the Greater London Council. The site was leased to the developers Taylor Woodrow and most of the original warehouses around the western basin were demolished and replaced by modern commercial buildings in the early 1970s, beginning with the bulky Tower Hotel (designed by Renton Howard Wood Partnership; opened in September 1973) on a site parallel to the river just to the east of Tower Bridge. This was followed by the World Trade Centre Building and Commodity Quay (both designed by architects Watkins Gray International). Development around the eastern basin was completed in the 1990s; the docks themselves becoming a marina. The development has often been cited as a model example of successful urban redevelopment.

In 1980, a plan was approved to open a St Katharine Docks Underground station on the proposed extension of the Jubilee line. It would have been between Fenchurch Street and Wapping. An eastwards extension was eventually built as part of the Jubilee line, but took a different route south of the Thames. The closest stations to the Docks today are Tower Hill (tube) and Tower Gateway DLR station, both roughly equidistant from the north-west corner of the Docks.

Vodafone made the first ever cellular telephone call in the United Kingdom on 1 January 1985, from St Katharine Docks to Newbury, and launched the UK&#x27;s first cellular network later that year.

Between 2005 and 2008, the former Danish lightship &quot;Lightship X&quot; (Ten) was moored on the west dock, and used as a restaurant, before returning to Denmark.
The marina, including restaurants and offices, was owned by Max Property Group, operated by investor Nick Leslau, since 2011, and was sold to Blackstone Group in 2014. Over the next three years, Blackstone completed a major restoration. In May 2017, the company retained agents to find potential buyers for the complex; the listing price was £435m. In October 2017, however, Blackstone withdrew the property from the market because bids were below the asking price.

==The docks today==
The area now features offices, public and private housing, a large hotel, shops and restaurants, a pub (The Dickens Inn, a former brewery dating back to the 18th century), a yachting marina and other recreational facilities. It remains a popular leisure destination.

The east dock is now dominated by the City Quay residential development, comprising more than 200 privately owned flats overlooking the marina. The south side of the east dock is surrounded by the South Quay Estate which was originally social housing. The dock is still used by small to medium-sized boats on a daily basis.

The anchor from the wreck of the Dutch East Indiaman &quot;Amsterdam&quot; is on display at the entrance to the east dock.

==Notable boats==

Notable boats regularly moored in the docks include:

*Gloriana, royal barge
*MV Havengore, former Port of London Authority hydrographic survey vessel

Several Thames sailing barges are also based in the docks.
*

==Notable residents==
*David Mellor, broadcaster and former politician, and Penelope, Viscountess Cobham
*David Suchet, actor
*Sir Michael Hodgkinson, business man

==In media ==

The area was used as one of the main filming locations for the Hammer Film Productions version of Dennis Wheatley&#x27;s novel &quot;To The Devil - A Daughter&quot; in 1976, with the character played by Richard Widmark living in one of the residential flats. Scenes featured the Ivory House and the retractable bridge.

In April 2021, it was filmed for &quot;Men&quot;, a folk horror film directed by Alex Garland and starring Jessie Buckley, released in 2022. It was used for Buckley&#x27;s character&#x27;s apartment with her abusive husband, and also where he died.

The inner gatefold photograph for The Rolling Stones album &quot;Through the Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)&quot; was taken at St Katherine Docks by Ethan Russell in May 1969.

==Tower Bridge Quay==

Tower Bridge Quay is close to the St Katharine Dock, providing river transport services managed by London River Services. The main service from Tower Bridge Quay is a circular river cruise operated by Crown River Cruises which goes non-stop to Westminster Millennium Pier before returning via the South Bank arts centre, as well as a Westminster-Greenwich express service run by Thames River Services.

The nearby Tower Millennium Pier, located on the other side of Tower Bridge, now provides the main commuter river boat services to Canary Wharf and Greenwich in the east and the West End in the west, and a fast visitor service to the London Eye.

<text>is a mail artist. He was responsible for the Brain Cell mail art project, which he began in June 1985 and retains thousands of members in more than 80 countries, e.g. Hans Braumüller, Theo Breuer, Michael Leigh or Litsa Spathi. In August 2001 he began the Fractal Portrait Project. He has taught art to school children for more than 25 years.

Cohen discovered mail art through the Canadian artist Byron Black. Early work by Cohen is a mixture of traditional Japanese imagery, contemporary icons, and numbers, as well as his signature, the letter &quot;C&quot;.

In 1997 Guy Bleus organised a solo exhibition of Cohen&#x27;s mail art work at the &quot;E-Mail Art Archives&quot; in the Centre for Visual Arts (now Z33) in Hasselt (Belgium).

Cohen&#x27;s family name is conventionally romanized as Kōen, but on the advice of a friend, he adopted the English spelling &#x27;Cohen&#x27;. He is not a Kohen.

<text>Air Caraïbes () is a French airline based in the French West Indies, with its headquarters in Les Abymes in Guadeloupe. The airline&#x27;s main base of operations is at Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport in Guadeloupe, with a focus city at Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport, near Fort-de-France in Martinique. It operates scheduled and charter services in the West Indies, as well as transatlantic flights based at Paris Orly Airport in Metropolitan France.

==History==
The airline was originally established as Société Caribéenne de Transports Aériens, and started operations in September 1994. In 2000, Air Guadeloupe was acquired by Groupe Dubreuil, which had previously established Air Vendée before the airline was acquired by Air France, rebranding it as Regional Airlines. The current Air Caraïbes was founded in July 2000 through the merger of various local airlines Air Guadeloupe, Air Martinique, Air Saint Barthélémy, and Air Saint Martin, and was created in response to the air transport needs of the French Caribbean territories. In 2002, the company flew 445,000 passengers and had €68 million in revenues.

In July 2003, the airline received its first ATR 72-500. On 12 December 2003, the airline began services to Orly Airport from Guadeloupe and Martinique using an Airbus A330-200. The transatlantic services were operated under a franchise agreement by Air Caraïbes Atlantique, a jointly run subsidiary airline of Groupe Dubreuil, which was registered in Martinique with its own air operator&#x27;s certificate, using an ICAO airline designator of &quot;CAJ&quot; and callsign of &quot;CAR LINE&quot;. Its operations were further integrated with and operated under the airline codes of Air Caraïbes at a later date. In June 2006, Air Caraïbes expanded its Airbus A330 fleet in receiving its first Airbus A330-300, and also planned to receive another A330-300 to replace one of its A330s. Air Caraïbes sold one of its Airbus A330-200s to the French Air Force, where it was re-registered and became one of the French presidential planes.

On 13 December 2013, Air Caraïbes announced it had ordered the Airbus A350, with a fleet of three A350-900s and three A350-1000s, the first of which were expected to be delivered in 2016 and 2020 respectively. On 14 December 2016, the airline received its first ATR 72-600. The airline received its first A350-900 on 28 February 2017, and its first A350-1000 on 19 December 2019. However prior to the delivery of some of the airline&#x27;s A350s, parent company Groupe Dubreuil allocated some to sister airline French Bee, before ordering additional A350s for both airlines by June 2019.

In 2024, the airline announced further fleet expansion plans with one A350-1000 and two ATR 72-600s to be delivered later in the year.

==Corporate affairs==
Air Caraïbes is owned by Groupe Dubreuil (85%) and had 1,105 employees as of 2019. Air Caraïbes uses Travel Technology Interactive&#x27;s airline management system, Aeropack.

==Destinations==

Air Caraïbes operates both a regional network in the West Indies, and a transatlantic long-haul network based at Paris Orly Airport in France.

===Codeshare agreements===
Air Caraïbes has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:

*Air Corsica
*Chalair Aviation
*French Bee

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 24 March 2001, Air Caraïbes Flight 1501 crashed into a house while on approach to Gustaf III Airport in Saint Barthélemy with 17 passengers and 2 crew members. All occupants were killed. One person on the ground was killed in the subsequent fire. The investigation concluded that the crash was caused by the pilot&#x27;s error in managing the thrust lever. The report blamed the crew for accidentally entering the thrust into BETA range.

<text>An eigenface ( ) is the name given to a set of eigenvectors when used in the computer vision problem of human face recognition. The approach of using eigenfaces for recognition was developed by Sirovich and Kirby and used by Matthew Turk and Alex Pentland in face classification. The eigenvectors are derived from the covariance matrix of the probability distribution over the high-dimensional vector space of face images. The eigenfaces themselves form a basis set of all images used to construct the covariance matrix. This produces dimension reduction by allowing the smaller set of basis images to represent the original training images. Classification can be achieved by comparing how faces are represented by the basis set.

== History ==

The eigenface approach began with a search for a low-dimensional representation of face images. Sirovich and Kirby showed that principal component analysis could be used on a collection of face images to form a set of basis features. These basis images, known as eigenpictures, could be linearly combined to reconstruct images in the original training set. If the training set consists of &quot;M&quot; images, principal component analysis could form a basis set of &quot;N&quot; images, where &quot;N &lt; M&quot;. The reconstruction error is reduced by increasing the number of eigenpictures; however, the number needed is always chosen less than &quot;M&quot;. For example, if you need to generate a number of &quot;N&quot; eigenfaces for a training set of &quot;M&quot; face images, you can say that each face image can be made up of &quot;proportions&quot; of all the &quot;K&quot; &quot;features&quot; or eigenfaces: Face image1 = (23% of E1) + (2% of E2) + (51% of E3) + ... + (1% En).

In 1991 M. Turk and A. Pentland expanded these results and presented the eigenface method of face recognition. In addition to designing a system for automated face recognition using eigenfaces, they showed a way of calculating the eigenvectors of a covariance matrix such that computers of the time could perform eigen-decomposition on a large number of face images. Face images usually occupy a high-dimensional space and conventional principal component analysis was intractable on such data sets. Turk and Pentland&#x27;s paper demonstrated ways to extract the eigenvectors based on matrices sized by the number of images rather than the number of pixels.

Once established, the eigenface method was expanded to include methods of preprocessing to improve accuracy. Multiple manifold approaches were also used to build sets of eigenfaces for different subjects and different features, such as the eyes.

== Generation ==

A set of eigenfaces can be generated by performing a mathematical process called principal component analysis (PCA) on a large set of images depicting different human faces. Informally, eigenfaces can be considered a set of &quot;standardized face ingredients&quot;, derived from statistical analysis of many pictures of faces. Any human face can be considered to be a combination of these standard faces. For example, one&#x27;s face might be composed of the average face plus 10% from eigenface 1, 55% from eigenface 2, and even −3% from eigenface 3. Remarkably, it does not take many eigenfaces combined together to achieve a fair approximation of most faces. Also, because a person&#x27;s face is not recorded by a digital photograph, but instead as just a list of values (one value for each eigenface in the database used), much less space is taken for each person&#x27;s face.

The eigenfaces that are created will appear as light and dark areas that are arranged in a specific pattern. This pattern is how different features of a face are singled out to be evaluated and scored. There will be a pattern to evaluate symmetry, whether there is any style of facial hair, where the hairline is, or an evaluation of the size of the nose or mouth. Other eigenfaces have patterns that are less simple to identify, and the image of the eigenface may look very little like a face.

The technique used in creating eigenfaces and using them for recognition is also used outside of face recognition: handwriting recognition, lip reading, voice recognition, sign language/hand gestures interpretation and medical imaging analysis. Therefore, some do not use the term eigenface, but prefer to use &#x27;eigenimage&#x27;.

=== Practical implementation ===

To create a set of eigenfaces, one must:
# Prepare a training set of face images. The pictures constituting the training set should have been taken under the same lighting conditions, and must be normalized to have the eyes and mouths aligned across all images. They must also be all resampled to a common pixel resolution (&quot;r&quot; × &quot;c&quot;). Each image is treated as one vector, simply by concatenating the rows of pixels in the original image, resulting in a single column with &quot;r&quot; × &quot;c&quot; elements. For this implementation, it is assumed that all images of the training set are stored in a single matrix T, where each column of the matrix is an image.
# Subtract the mean. The average image a has to be calculated and then subtracted from each original image in T.
# Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix S. Each eigenvector has the same dimensionality (number of components) as the original images, and thus can itself be seen as an image. The eigenvectors of this covariance matrix are therefore called eigenfaces. They are the directions in which the images differ from the mean image. Usually this will be a computationally expensive step (if at all possible), but the practical applicability of eigenfaces stems from the possibility to compute the eigenvectors of S efficiently, without ever computing S explicitly, as detailed below.
# Choose the principal components. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and arrange eigenvectors accordingly. The number of principal components &quot;k&quot; is determined arbitrarily by setting a threshold ε on the total variance. Total variance , = number of components, and formula_1 represents component eigenvalue.
# k is the smallest number that satisfies formula_2

These eigenfaces can now be used to represent both existing and new faces: we can project a new (mean-subtracted) image on the eigenfaces and thereby record how that new face differs from the mean face. The eigenvalues associated with each eigenface represent how much the images in the training set vary from the mean image in that direction. Information is lost by projecting the image on a subset of the eigenvectors, but losses are minimized by keeping those eigenfaces with the largest eigenvalues. For instance, working with a 100 × 100 image will produce 10,000 eigenvectors. In practical applications, most faces can typically be identified using a projection on between 100 and 150 eigenfaces, so that most of the 10,000 eigenvectors can be discarded.

=== Matlab example code ===
Here is an example of calculating eigenfaces with Extended Yale Face Database B. To evade computational and storage bottleneck, the face images are sampled down by a factor 4×4=16.

clear all;
close all;
load yalefaces
[h, w, n] = size(yalefaces);
d = h * w;
% vectorize images
x = reshape(yalefaces, [d n]);
x = double(x);
% subtract mean
mean_matrix = mean(x, 2);
x = bsxfun(@minus, x, mean_matrix);
% calculate covariance
s = cov(x&#x27;);
% obtain eigenvalue &amp; eigenvector
[V, D] = eig(s);
eigval = diag(D);
% sort eigenvalues in descending order
eigval = eigval(end: - 1:1);
V = fliplr(V);
% show mean and 1st through 15th principal eigenvectors
figure, subplot(4, 4, 1)
imagesc(reshape(mean_matrix, [h, w]))
colormap gray
for i = 1:15
 subplot(4, 4, i + 1)
 imagesc(reshape(V(:, i), h, w))
end

Note that although the covariance matrix S generates many eigenfaces, only a fraction of those are needed to represent the majority of the faces. For example, to represent 95% of the total variation of all face images, only the first 43 eigenfaces are needed. To calculate this result, implement the following code:

% evaluate the number of principal components needed to represent 95% Total variance.
eigsum = sum(eigval);
csum = 0;
for i = 1:d
 csum = csum + eigval(i);
 tv = csum / eigsum;
 if tv &gt; 0.95
 k95 = i;
 break
 end;
end;
=== Computing the eigenvectors ===

Performing PCA directly on the covariance matrix of the images is often computationally infeasible. If small images are used, say 100 × 100 pixels, each image is a point in a 10,000-dimensional space and the covariance matrix S is a matrix of 10,000 × 10,000 = 108 elements. However the rank of the covariance matrix is limited by the number of training examples: if there are &quot;N&quot; training examples, there will be at most &quot;N&quot; − 1 eigenvectors with non-zero eigenvalues. If the number of training examples is smaller than the dimensionality of the images, the principal components can be computed more easily as follows.

Let T be the matrix of preprocessed training examples, where each column contains one mean-subtracted image. The covariance matrix can then be computed as S = TTT and the eigenvector decomposition of S is given by
:formula_3
However TTT is a large matrix, and if instead we take the eigenvalue decomposition of
:formula_4
then we notice that by pre-multiplying both sides of the equation with T, we obtain
:formula_5
Meaning that, if ui is an eigenvector of TTT, then vi = Tui is an eigenvector of S. If we have a training set of 300 images of 100 × 100 pixels, the matrix TTT is a 300 × 300 matrix, which is much more manageable than the 10,000 × 10,000 covariance matrix. Notice however that the resulting vectors vi are not normalised; if normalisation is required it should be applied as an extra step.

===Connection with SVD===
Let denote the data matrix with column as the image vector with mean subtracted. Then,

: formula_6

Let the singular value decomposition (SVD) of be:

: formula_7
Then the eigenvalue decomposition for formula_8 is:

: formula_9, where Λ=diag (eigenvalues of formula_10)
Thus we can see easily that:
: The eigenfaces = the first formula_11 (formula_12) columns of formula_13 associated with the nonzero singular values.
: The ith eigenvalue of formula_14 ith singular value of formula_15

Using SVD on data matrix {{mvar|X}}, it is unnecessary to calculate the actual covariance matrix to get eigenfaces.

== Use in facial recognition ==
{{See also|Facial recognition system}}
Facial recognition was the motivation for the creation of eigenfaces. For this use, eigenfaces have advantages over other techniques available, such as the system&#x27;s speed and efficiency. As eigenface is primarily a dimension reduction method, a system can represent many subjects with a relatively small set of data. As a face-recognition system it is also fairly invariant to large reductions in image sizing; however, it begins to fail considerably when the variation between the seen images and probe image is large.

To recognise faces, gallery images – those seen by the system – are saved as collections of weights describing the contribution each eigenface has to that image. When a new face is presented to the system for classification, its own weights are found by projecting the image onto the collection of eigenfaces. This provides a set of weights describing the probe face. These weights are then classified against all weights in the gallery set to find the closest match. A nearest-neighbour method is a simple approach for finding the Euclidean distance between two vectors, where the minimum can be classified as the closest subject.{{r|Turk1991a|p=590}}

Intuitively, the recognition process with the eigenface method is to project query images into the face-space spanned by eigenfaces calculated, and to find the closest match to a face class in that face-space.
;Pseudo code
:* Given input image vector formula_16, the mean image vector from the database formula_17, calculate the weight of the k-th eigenface as: formula_18
:*:Then form a weight vector formula_19
:* Compare W with weight vectors formula_20 of images in the database. Find the Euclidean distance. formula_21
:* If formula_22, then the mth entry in the database is a candidate of recognition.
:* If formula_23, then {{mvar|U}} may be an unknown face and can be added to the database.
:* If formula_24 is not a face image.

The weights of each gallery image only convey information describing that image, not that subject. An image of one subject under frontal lighting may have very different weights to those of the same subject under strong left lighting. This limits the application of such a system. Experiments in the original Eigenface paper presented the following results: an average of 96% with light variation, 85% with orientation variation, and 64% with size variation.{{r|Turk1991a|p=590}}

Various extensions have been made to the eigenface method. The eigenfeatures method combines facial metrics (measuring distance between facial features) with the eigenface representation. Fisherface uses linear discriminant analysis and is less sensitive to variation in lighting and pose of the face. Fisherface uses labelled data to retain more of the class-specific information during the dimension reduction stage.

A further alternative to eigenfaces and Fisherfaces is the active appearance model. This approach uses an active shape model to describe the outline of a face. By collecting many face outlines, principal component analysis can be used to form a basis set of models that encapsulate the variation of different faces.

Many modern approaches still use principal component analysis as a means of dimension reduction or to form basis images for different modes of variation.

==Review==
Eigenface provides an easy and cheap way to realize face recognition in that:
* Its training process is completely automatic and easy to code.
* Eigenface adequately reduces statistical complexity in face image representation.
* Once eigenfaces of a database are calculated, face recognition can be achieved in real time.
* Eigenface can handle large databases.
However, the deficiencies of the eigenface method are also obvious:
* It is very sensitive to lighting, scale and translation, and requires a highly controlled environment.
* Eigenface has difficulty capturing expression changes.
* The most significant eigenfaces are mainly about illumination encoding and do not provide useful information regarding the actual face.

To cope with illumination distraction in practice, the eigenface method usually discards the first three eigenfaces from the dataset. Since illumination is usually the cause behind the largest variations in face images, the first three eigenfaces will mainly capture the information of 3-dimensional lighting changes, which has little contribution to face recognition. By discarding those three eigenfaces, there will be a decent amount of boost in accuracy of face recognition, but other methods such as fisherface and linear space still have the advantage.

<text>Philip Hardwick (15 June 1792 in London – 28 December 1870) was an English architect, particularly associated with railway stations and warehouses in London and elsewhere. Hardwick is probably best known for London&#x27;s demolished Euston Arch and its twin station, the original Birmingham Curzon Street, which stands today as the oldest railway terminus building in the world.

== Career ==
Hardwick was born at 9 Rathbone Place (since demolished) in Westminster, London. He was educated at Dr Barrow&#x27;s school in Soho Square and trained as an architect under his father, Thomas Hardwick Jr. (1752–1829), who was in turn the son of architect Thomas Hardwick Sr. (1725–1798). The Hardwick family name spans over 150 years in the history of British architecture.

Philip Hardwick entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1808 and then studied in France and Italy from 1815 to 1819. After travelling Europe, he took over from his father as Surveyor to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, London. This post later passed on to Philip&#x27;s son – Philip Charles Hardwick, meaning that three successive generations of the family held the post.
In 1825, he was appointed architect to the St Katherine&#x27;s Dock Company, for whom he designed the dock buildings, Thomas Telford designing the docks themselves. In 1829 he became architect to the Goldsmiths&#x27; Company, designing a new hall for them which was opened in 1835. In 1836, Hardwick became architect to the London and Birmingham Railway. He built a great Doric propylaeum, which became known as the &quot;Euston Arch&quot;, as an entrance to the railway&#x27;s Euston Station. In 1838 he built the Curzon Street Station as the railway&#x27;s Birmingham terminus. It is an austere cubic three-story building in the Ionic style, with a portico of four giant Ionic columns.

At Babraham Hall in 1822–1823, on the site of a long-demolished sixteenth-century house, Hardwick adopted a Jacobean style, using red brick with limestone dressings. Brick was used again at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, when, in 1843–1845, Hardwick, in collaboration with his son, built a new hall and library. They used a Tudor style, the red brick varied with black brick decoration, and pale stone trim, foreshadowing the later fashion for polychrome brickwork. For churches, Hardwick used both the classical style, as at Christ Church, Cosway Street, Marylebone (1824–1825), and the Gothic, as at Holy Trinity, Bolton (1823–1825), St John&#x27;s, Catford (1854), and the Royal Garrison Church, Aldershot (1863).

Hardwick gained a reputation as a surveyor and was employed by the Westminster Bridge estates, the Portman London estate, Greenwich Hospital, and the estate of the 2nd Marquess of Salisbury (1829–1835). He was also surveyor to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (from 1842), and assisted Sir Francis Smith in designing Wellington Barracks next to Buckingham Palace in 1833.

In 1831 his father in law, the architect John Shaw Senior, helped elect Hardwick as a fellow of the Royal Society. Hardwick was a founding member of the Institute of British Architects (1834) – later (1837) the RIBA – and was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1839 he was one of the judges for the new Royal Exchange building in the City of London, and was appointed to select the design for the Oxford Museum in 1854. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1839, and became a Royal Academician in 1841.

In 1854, he received the seventh Royal Gold Medal for architecture.

== Family and pupils ==

Philip married Julia Shaw in 1819, at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. Julia&#x27;s father, John Shaw Sr. (1776–1832), and brother, John Shaw Jr. (1803–1870), were both architects. The two families lived close by within the boroughs of Westminster and Holborn. Philip Hardwick had two sons, the eldest died of smallpox whilst still at Eton, the younger, Philip Charles Hardwick, was born in 1822 and trained as an architect under him. Philip Charles began working in the firm around 1843.

Philip Hardwick&#x27;s pupils included John Loughborough Pearson, Gothic revival architect of Truro Cathedral, Thomas Henry Wyatt (1807–1880), T. Roger Smith (1830–1903), and Charles Locke Eastlake (1836–1906).

Hardwick was a close friend of the artist J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851), who had been a pupil of his father. In 1851 Turner chose Hardwick as an executor to his will.

Hardwick and much of his extended family were buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

== Euston Arch ==
Hardwick&#x27;s best-known work is likely the 1837 &#x27;Propylaeum&#x27; or Doric Euston Arch at the old Euston station, designed for the London and Birmingham Railway at the cost of £35,000. Like Inigo Jones some 200 years earlier, Hardwick had been inspired by Italian architecture, following a trip to Italy in 1818–1819.

Despite the efforts of John Betjeman and other conservationists, the Euston Arch was demolished in the early 1960s. The gates of the arch are stored at the National Railway Museum in York. In 1994, the historian Dan Cruickshank discovered 4,000 tons, or about 60%, of the arch&#x27;s stones buried in the bed of the River Lea in the East End of London, including the architrave stones with the gilded EUSTON lettering. This discovery has opened the possibility of a reconstruction of the arch.

<doc id="348697" wikidata="Q3038780" url="?curid=348697" title="Fallen Dragon">
<text>Fallen Dragon is a science fiction novel by British writer Peter F. Hamilton. It was first published in 2001 by Macmillan. It follows the adventures of the mercenary Lawrence Newton as he attempts to capture what he believes is a fabulous treasure, only to find something of much greater importance.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Fallen Dragon&quot; takes place during the 25th century. In the preceding centuries, a means of Faster-than-light (FTL) space travel was discovered, allowing a speed of one-half of a light-year per day. This led to a series of colonization efforts in a radius of about 70 light years around Sol, but these ended as their costs proved prohibitive. The only major ongoing starflight efforts are carried out by the Zantiu-Braun megacorporation, who use their fleet of starships to periodically plunder their colonies in technically legal &quot;asset realization&quot; raids, typically involving military occupation of the planet in question. As it is cheaper to copy technology than ship it, these efforts normally collect single samples of interesting goods, or raw materials that are expensive on Earth. Zantiu-Braun is controlled by clones of Simon Roderick, who is motivated by the idea of uplifting the entire human race to his ideal.

The story follows the life of Lawrence Newton from the colony planet Amethi, both in the current timeframe and in a series of flashbacks. In the current time, Newton is a mercenary in the Zantiu-Braun strategic security forces, who leads a squad of troopers wearing organic armour suits called &quot;Skin&quot; that render them practically invulnerable.

As a teenager, Newton lived on the planet Amethi and is the oldest son of one of the most powerful members of the board of the corporation which controls the planet. Lawrence dreams about being a starship pilot, despite being told by his father that starship exploration is finished. Lawrence loses interest in schoolwork and withdraws socially. His father takes him to a holiday resort, where a gorgeous girl named Roselyn breaks through Lawrence&#x27;s isolation, and the two develop a passionate relationship. Roselyn eventually informs Lawrence that there actually are space exploration missions through companies on Earth. Never having given up on his dream, he prepares to tell his father of his decision to leave school and overhears his father mentioning that Roselyn was paid to meet and seduce him. In a furious rage, he decides to leave Amethi immediately. He avoids detection by his father through the use of advanced quasi-sentient software, Prime, given to him by his friend Vinnie. Lawrence makes it to Earth and scores well on the Zantiu-Braun officer candidacy exams. However, lacking sufficient shares in the company, he is limited to a strategic security job instead of starship captain. As a Skin, he takes part on two missions of note, which are told over a series of short vignettes.

One was on the planet Thallspring, which is fairly Earth-like. He is stationed in the town Memu Bay, but he journeys through the hinterlands to the Arnoon province. He stops a trio of squaddies from a different platoon from gang-raping one of the villagers. Throughout his stay, Newton is bothered by something odd about the village, which seems to have a quality of living that is well beyond what one would expect given the surroundings. He is convinced they are hiding something, but he is unable to discover it.

The other was on the planet Santa Chico, where the founders modified themselves at a genetic level to coexist with the planet&#x27;s biota. The mission goes disastrously wrong. As the colonists are no longer fully human, Zantiu-Braun&#x27;s soldiers have trouble communicating with them, unable to fully comprehend their new lifestyle. The civilisation has little in the way of centralised industry or anything of value to Earth, and it remains extremely hostile to the Zantiu-Braun forces. The biological augmentations make them an equal match for the Skins, which they invented years ago, and inflict severe casualties on the asset realisation force. They eventually destroy a captured asteroid in orbit to create a Kessler syndrome that closes the sky, making further trips to the planet impossible. Newton concludes that the asset realisation concept is no longer workable; the technology levels of the colony planets are growing so quickly that future missions will be too dangerous to be worthwhile. However, during this mission, Newton apparently solves the mystery of Arnoon. Arnoon had, in plain sight, alien plants living on unsterilised soil bearing edible fruits. This would be impossible for Thallspring technology to create, so he concludes it was provided by Santa Chico geneticists. Lawrence plans to &quot;realize&quot; their unknown wealth for himself and to use it to buy his retirement. When he learns of another mission to Thallspring, he ensures his team is part of the contingent.

In the time since the first mission, Thallspring has advanced greatly. A small group has formed an effective resistance movement in preparation for the next asset realisation mission, led by Denise Ebourn from Arnoon. As a cover, Denise works in a kindergarten, where she tells the kids supposedly fictional stories about an ancient alien galaxy-wide civilisation and an alien prince named Mozark. Denise uses an advanced alien intelligence known as a &quot;dragon&quot; to enhance herself, her resistance-cellmates, and the villagers in Arnoon. When the Z-B mission arrives, her team uses their Prime software to sabotage the Z-B efforts with some effect. However, Newton, now a sergeant, also has Prime, and he uses it to return his platoon to Arnoon in search of its treasure. As Denise learns that Lawrence is headed for Arnoon village, she races to intercept him.

A violent confrontation takes place between Lawrence&#x27;s platoon and a group of Arnoon villagers, ending with a wounded Lawrence staggering alone towards Arnoon village. When he arrives, he and his Skin suit are spent, and he is near death. The villagers, one of whom (Denise&#x27;s sister) is the girl he previously saved from being raped, revives him. They reveal that their wealth comes from a damaged alien &quot;dragon&quot; with greatly advanced technological knowledge such as the nanotechnology used to enhance the resistance movement. The dragon is a spaceliving creature which is damaged and has lost much of its memory. To repay the dragon for its help, the villagers plan to steal one of Zantiu-Braun&#x27;s starships to travel to the red sun where the dragon says its species lives.

After meeting the dragon and learning its story, Lawrence decides to join them, and he helps them to hijack a spaceship. They are pursued by a damaged Simon Roderick clone who is determined to use all means to capture the technology for himself, not even trusting his clone brothers. Another Simon Roderick clone follows, to acquire the technology and to stop his clone brother from becoming the only human to possess the powerful knowledge. Denise and Lawrence arrive at the red star and quickly find the dragons. They learn that the dragons are a disengaged race who do nothing but amass knowledge, sharing it freely with others. The Arnoon dragon was simply a seed, one out of billions, and no more important to them than a single sperm cell is to humans. Since they arrived first, Denise and Lawrence convince the red star dragon that the deranged Simon Roderick will misuse their knowledge, and the dragon disables his ship. The dragon civilisation gives their patternform construction knowledge to Lawrence, Denise and to the other Simon Roderick, in an agreement arranged by Denise and Lawrence so that the knowledge will be shared freely on Earth, not monopolised by Zantiu-Braun.

Lawrence uses the technology to construct the spaceship he has wanted since he was a teenager. He flies back in time through an ancient time portal, mentioned in Denise&#x27;s kindergarten story, and then travels to Amethi. There he uses the technology to transform into Vinnie, one of young Lawrence&#x27;s closest friends. After giving young Lawrence the Prime program so he can travel to Earth (closing the time loop), &quot;Vinnie&quot; changes into young Lawrence, and goes to make up with Roselyn.

<doc id="348705" wikidata="Q1549345" url="?curid=348705" title="Sir Orfeo">
<text>Sir Orfeo is an anonymous Middle English Breton lai dating from the late 13th or early 14th century. It retells the story of Orpheus as a king who rescues his wife from the fairy king. The folk song &quot;Orfeo&quot; (Roud 136, Child 19) is based on this poem.

==History and manuscripts==

&quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; was probably written in the late 13th or early 14th century in the Westminster-Middlesex area. It is preserved in three manuscripts: the oldest, Advocates 19.2.1, known as the Auchinleck MS. is dated about 1330; Harley 3810 is from about the beginning of the fifteenth century; and Ashmole 61 was compiled over the course of several years, the portion of the MS. containing &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; dating around 1488. The beginning of the poem describes itself as a Breton lai and says it is derived from a no longer extant text, the &quot;Lai d&#x27;Orphey&quot;.

The story contains a mixture of the Greek myth of Orpheus with Celtic mythology and folklore concerning fairies, introduced into English via the Old French Breton lais of poets like Marie de France. The &quot;Wooing of Etain&quot; bears particular resemblance to the romance and was a probable influence.

The fragmentary Child Ballad 19, &quot;King Orfeo&quot;, is closely related to this poem, the surviving text containing only portions of the known story.

==Synopsis==

Sir Orfeo, a king in England, loses his wife Heurodis (i.e. Eurydice) to the fairy king, who steals her away from under an ympe-tre (a tree propagated by grafting), probably an apple or cherry tree. Heurodis had visited the orchard the day before, accompanied by two maidens, to sleep beneath the shade of its branches; however, when she had awoken from her midday nap, she was so distressed that they had to call for the help of knights to restrain her. In her sleep, she had been visited by the king of the Otherworld, she claimed, who was intent upon taking her to his underworld kingdom. Now, a day later, she is in the orchard again, as the king of the Otherworld has instructed her to be, and despite a posse of armed knights surrounding and protecting her, she vanishes away.

Orfeo, distraught by this, leaves his court and wanders alone in a forest. He has left his steward in charge of the kingdom and seems to have no intention of returning to his capital city of Winchester (in southern England, the old capital of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex). Winchester was called Thrace in those days, the reader is assured. Sir Orfeo leaves instructions that when they learn of his death, they should convene a parliament and choose a new king.

Sir Orfeo wanders in the forest for many years, sleeping on the bare earth and living on berries and fruits in summer, roots and the bark of trees in winter. After ten years, he sees Heurodis riding past in the company of a fairy host. She is riding with sixty ladies, with not a man among them, hawking by a river. He follows these ladies into a cliff and travels for three miles through the rock until he emerges into a fairy kingdom, a flat expanse of countryside presided over by a magnificent castle, built from gold and crystal and glass. He is allowed into the castle by the gatekeeper and looking all about, he sees, lying inside these castle walls, people who had been thought to be dead, but who were not:
:&quot;Than he gan bihold about al,
:And seighe liggeand within the wal
:Of folk that were thider y-brought
:And thought dede, and nare nought.&quot;

Some were headless, others had been drowned or burned:
:&quot;Sum stode withouten hede...
:And sum were in water adreynt,
:And some with fire al forschreynt.&quot;

Amongst these bodies he sees his dear wife Heurodis, asleep again. Despite suffering a rebuke by the king for being the only person ever to have entered this castle without having been summoned, Sir Orfeo entertains the fairy king by playing his harp and the fairy king, pleased with Orfeo&#x27;s music, offers him the chance to choose a reward: he chooses Heurodis. Despite initial protestations by the king, Sir Orfeo reminds him that he gave him his word and Sir Orfeo returns with Heurodis to Winchester:
:&quot;To Winchester he is y-come,
:That was his owhen cité,
:Ac no man knewe that it was he.&quot;

Sir Orfeo arrives in Winchester, his own city, but nobody knows who he is. He takes lodgings with a beggar and, leaving Heurodis safely there, travels into the city wearing the beggar&#x27;s clothes, where he is insulted by many people for his unkempt looks. The steward, however, for the love of Sir Orfeo, invites this unknown musician into the castle to play his harp. The final action of the story is the testing of the steward&#x27;s loyalty upon Sir Orfeo&#x27;s return with Heurodis to reclaim his throne. Quickly, the harp is recognized and Sir Orfeo explains that he found it ten years ago beside the mutilated body of a man who had been eaten by a lion. Upon hearing this, the steward faints in distress and grief. The beggar then reveals to the court that it is Sir Orfeo himself who is speaking to them and when the steward recovers, he is assured by Sir Orfeo that, if he had been pleased to learn of his death, he would have had him thrown out of his kingdom. As it is, however, he will make him his heir. Heurodis is brought to the castle and all the people weep for joy that their king and queen are alive and well.

==Manuscript differences==

The three preserved manuscripts—the Auchinleck MS., London, British Library, Harley 3810/I, and Oxford, Bodleian Library, Ashmole 61–have striking differences present throughout the texts. The three manuscripts are very similar in the content of the story; however, there exists a small discrepancy between the Auchinleck and Ashmole manuscripts: Sir Orfeo&#x27;s wife is called Meroudys in the Ashmole manuscript and is called Heurodus in the Auchinleck manuscript. While their content is similar, each manuscript omits certain lines and adds lines in order to portray the story more accurately, which may be a result of the time period.

The Auchinleck manuscript was originally written on 332 vellum leaves. Most of this manuscript has been mutilated, and a large number of leaves have been cut away. Eight of these missing leaves have been recovered, and the present contents of the volume originally consisted of 52 gatherings. This manuscript is the closest to the presumed original version and is often known as the &quot;base&quot; text of 604 lines.

The Harley 3180 manuscript was composed of 34 paper folios and contained only six works: &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; and moral and religious pieces being two of them. The verse on the last folio is written in sixteenth-century hand with an inscription being: &quot;Hic liber olim fuit liber Wil’mi Shawcler’ et Cur de Badesly Clinton: Eccl’a.&quot; The Harleian Collection version of &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; has only been printed once. It contains only 509 lines, about 100 shorter than the Auchinleck version. Using that as the base text this Harleian version omits lines 49–50, 166–7, 206–7, 241–2, 247–50, 293–6, 391–404, 411–12, 439–42, 445–6, 458, 481–2, 485–6, 501–8, 521–2, 527–8, 539–40, 545–52, 555–6, 559–62, 565–82, 585–6, 589–94, 597–602. Passages are also added to this manuscript: two lines after line 280, two lines after line 468, two lines after 518 and four lines added at the end.

The last manuscript is Ashmole 61, which is a tall narrow folio containing 162 paper folios. This manuscript contained 41 articles of romance, saints&#x27; lives, and various moral and religious pieces. &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; was the 39th article in this manuscript. Using Auchnileck as the base text, Ashmole omits lines 19–22, 39–46, 59–60, 67–68, 92–98, 123–4, 177–8, 299–302, 367–79, 394, 397–400, 402–4, 409–10, 481–2, 591–2. Passages are also added: six lines in the beginning, two after line 104, two after line 120, one before and after line 132, nine after line 134, one after line 159, two after line 180, two after line 190, two after line 270, two after line 274, one after line 356, three after line 296, two after line 416, two after line 468, two after line 476, one before and after line 550, two after line 558, and six at the end.

==Folklore elements==
The poem shows Celtic influence in the Kingdom of the Fairies being a parallel dimension to the everyday world rather than the Land of the Dead as in the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. The ability to move between one world and the other distinguishes the tale as told in its various British versions such as &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; and the Shetland ballad &quot;King Orfeo&quot; where the captors are envisaged as inhabitants of a parallel fairy domain rather than as the infernal region of the Dead ruled over by Hades as in the Greek myth.

Katharine Briggs sees the tale as related in British folk narratives as being equally influenced by Celtic stories such as The Wooing of Etain as it is from Classical sources, in particular the version of the story in Ovid’s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; which would have been the most widely available source in Britain in the Middle Ages and for some time after

==Commentary==
Thrace is identified at the beginning of the poem as &quot;the old name for Winchester&quot;, which effectively announces that the well-known Greek myth is to be transposed into an English context:
:&quot;This king sojournd in Traciens,
:That was a cité of noble defens -
:For Winchester was cleped tho
:Traciens, withouten no.&quot;

The poem&#x27;s unique innovation, in comparison to the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, may be that the underworld is not a world of the dead, but rather a world of people who have been taken away when on the point of death. In &quot;The Faery World of &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot;&quot;, Bruce Mitchell suggested that the passage was an interpolation. However, in a seminal article &quot;The Dead and the Taken&quot; D. Allen demonstrated that the theme of another world of people who are taken at the point of death (but who are not dead) is a well-established element in folklore, and thereby shows the complete folklorisation of the Orpheus story.

Ruth Evans views the lai of Sir Orfeo to be not just a medieval retelling of Orpheus, but also a work influenced by the politics of the time; Orfeo has been criticized as a rex inutilis (&#x27;useless king&#x27;/roi faneant) a medieval literary motif that links Orfeo with several late thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century sovereigns, including Edward II and, in his role as a harpist, as a type of David, the royal figure upon whom many medieval kings modeled themselves. When Orfeo outcasts himself from society, he is bringing in the idea of a king being an isolated man. He leaves his kingdom in the hands of his steward, upsetting the order of things. Orfeo himself is upset when his wife his taken, and Evans says in her essay that the poem&#x27;s narrative syntax, by doubling social order with the classic romance structure of exile, risk and then reintegration suggests an emotional link to the loss and recovery of a wife with the loss and recovery of a kingdom. Evans argues that even if it was not the intention of the author, when read in a cultural context this interpretation is possible through the concept of the “political unconscious”

Patricia Vicari, in her essay &quot;Sparagmos: Orpheus Among the Christians,&quot; says that in &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; Orpheus the hero is very Celticized, and says that the fate of Queen Heurodis is similar to the fates of other Celtic heroines. Instead of having a Christian take on the myth, Vicari says, &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; sticks to a rather pantheistic view, where the fairy king of Celtic literature rules over the underworld as neither good nor bad - as opposed to J. Friedman, who argues that Christian undertones relate Heurodis to Eve taken away by Satan in the form of a fairy king. This Christian reading does not translate well overall, however: the Otherworld is described as attractive as well as menacing, and the fairy king is more a force of nature than an evil villain. Heurodis is also not being punished for any kind of sin or transgression, nor is she necessarily the victim of a targeted attack, but was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time.

==Similarities and differences with Orpheus==

&quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; takes the core elements of the myth of Orpheus and changes them into a more modern setting, giving a happy ending to an otherwise tragic myth.

===Similarities===

Very similar to Orpheus of myth is the quality of singing and playing on a stringed instrument that Sir Orfeo exhibits. His wife, like Eurydice, showed loyalty by resisting advances. In the myth, Orpheus goes marching down to Tartarus to ask for Eurydice back while Sir Orfeo exiles himself for ten years until he chances a glimpse of his wife. Another similarity between these two stories is found in the name of Orfeo&#x27;s kingdom, Traciens (Thrace), which perhaps for the sake of familiarity for the modern readers has been moved to be the old name of Winchester, England. Orfeo obtains the Fairy King&#x27;s permission to take his wife home with him by using his beautiful music playing, much the same as Orpheus did in the original Greek myth.

===Differences===

Unlike Orpheus, who was actually descended from gods, Sir Orfeo&#x27;s parents were just named after them. When Sir Orfeo goes to take his wife back, no condition is issued to not look back at her. Sir Orfeo exiles himself for ten years, citing not wanting to see any more women after suffering the loss of his beautiful wife. For Orpheus, this self-exile occurs after he has lost Eurydice the second time. The loss of Eurydice, and the saving of Heurodis is the main difference between the tragedy of the original myth and the romance lai &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot;.

==Similarity with &quot;The Matter of Rome&quot;==

This treatment of elements from Greek mythology is similar to that of the Old French literary cycle known as the Matter of Rome, which was made up of Greek and Roman mythology, together with episodes from the history of classical antiquity, focusing on military heroes like Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar – where the protagonists were anachronistically treated as knights of chivalry, not much different from the heroes of the &quot;chansons de geste&quot;.

==Reception==

Critics unanimously call &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; one of the best of the English romances. Though retold in a medieval setting, it seems to lack the concepts that were apparent in other medieval romances. &quot;It lacks, however, any sense of chivalric values and ideals, and though the hero undergoes much suffering in the course of the story, this simply testifies to the power of his [Orfeo&#x27;s] devotion and is not related to any scheme of self-realization.&quot; The main contribute of the success of the story comes from the atmosphere of the storytelling. &quot;...its main success is usually attributed rather to the potency of the magical atmosphere than to any particular skill on the part of the author... the poem is an outstanding example of narrative skill, and the author&#x27;s artistry is such that his technical brilliance may be [at first] mistaken for untutored simplicity.&quot; There is however no evidence that Sir Orfeo was written by a man, and Breton Lays on which it claims to be based were written by Marie de France. Critic Jeff Rider comments that &quot;What makes Sir Orfeo so remarkable is the degree of critical response it has generated, the high praise it has earned, and the almost utter lack of accord among critics as to its interpretation. The poem seems to be remythified with each reading; each reading makes us feel that the previous one, even yesterday&#x27;s, was inadequate.&quot;

<doc id="348710" wikidata="Q706143" url="?curid=348710" title="David Frankfurter">
<text>David Frankfurter (, 9 July 1909 – 19 July 1982) was a Croatian Jew known for assassinating Wilhelm Gustloff, the Swiss branch leader of the Nazi Party, in February 1936 in Davos, Switzerland. He surrendered and confessed, telling the police that &quot;I fired the shots because I am a Jew.&quot;

Frankfurter was sentenced to 18 years in prison for murder. Shortly after V-E Day, he was granted a parliamentary pardon and released. As he left prison, sympathetic crowds cheered him as a hero.

==Background, family and education==
Frankfurter was born in Daruvar, Croatia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later part of Yugoslavia for years), to a Jewish family: father Mavro and mother Rebekka (née Figel) Frankfurter. His father was a rabbi in Daruvar and later the chief rabbi in Vinkovci, where the Frankfurter family relocated in 1914. Frankfurter was a sickly child and suffered an incurable periostitis for which he underwent seven operations between the ages of six and twenty-three. His doctors feared he would not live a normal lifespan. He graduated from elementary and later secondary school, in 1929, with high marks. 

After completing his basic education, he began studying medicine. His father sent him to Germany to study dentistry, first in Leipzig and then in 1931 in Frankfurt, the town of his ancestors. 

==Shooting of Gustloff==
While studying in Germany, Frankfurter witnessed the Nazis coming to power and their imposition of anti-semitic measures. The rise of Nazism in Germany and the banning of Jews from German universities compelled him to move to Switzerland to continue his studies, and he settled in Bern in 1934. There among the Germans and German-speaking Swiss, the Nazi movement gained ground, led by Wilhelm Gustloff. Having become convinced of the danger posed by the Nazis, Frankfurter kept an eye on Gustloff, head of the Foreign Section of the Nazi Party in Switzerland (NSDAP). The latter man ordered the propaganda piece &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; (1903) to be published there for distribution. 

Motivated by such insults and attacks on Jewish people, Frankfurter bought a gun in Bern in 1936 and resolved to assassinate Gustloff. Frankfurter found Gustloff&#x27;s address, which was listed in the phone book. On 4 February 1936, he went to the Gustloff home; Gustloff&#x27;s wife Hedwig received him and showed him into the study, asking him to wait since her husband was on the telephone.

When Gustloff, who was in the adjoining room, entered his office where Frankfurter was sitting opposite a picture of Adolf Hitler, the young man pulled out his revolver and shot Gustloff five times: in the head, neck and chest. He left the premises and prepared to commit suicide. However, he was unable to follow through, and instead turned himself in to the police. 

The assassination of Gustloff was widely publicized throughout Europe, especially due to Nazi propaganda directed by Joseph Goebbels. Adolf Hitler prohibited an immediate retaliation against the Jews of Germany at the time, fearing an international boycott of the winter and summer Olympics that were due to be held in Germany. He wanted to use the Games to promote propaganda on the world stage about the size, power and ideology of the Nazi movement. Nevertheless, an editorial on the front page of Völkischer Beobachter demanded Frankfurter&#x27;s execution. 

Gustloff was declared a &quot;Blutzeuge/Blood Martyr&quot; of the Nazi cause. His assassination was later used in propaganda, serving as pretext, along with Herschel Grynszpan&#x27;s assassination of German diplomat Ernst vom Rath, for the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom. While most people in Switzerland were sympathetic towards Frankfurter, the Swiss government prosecuted the case strictly. It wanted to maintain its position of neutrality. Frankfurter was convicted of murder and sentenced to 18 years in prison and subsequent expulsion from the country. His father visited his son in prison and asked him, &quot;Who actually needed this?&quot;

In 1941, as the Nazis occupied Vinkovci, Frankfurter&#x27;s father was forced to stand on a table while the German soldiers spat in his face, pulled out hair from his long beard, and struck him with their rifle butts. Frankfurter&#x27;s father was later killed by Ustaše in the Jasenovac concentration camp during the Holocaust.

As the Second World War came to an end, Frankfurter applied for a pardon on 27 February 1945. The Swiss press was overwhelmingly in favor of clemency, which was granted on 17 May, by a vote of 78 to 12. However, he still had to leave the country and pay restitution and court costs for his case. As Frankfurter left prison, sympathetic crowds cheered him as a hero, chanting, &quot;God bless you.&quot;

In 1969, the cantonal parliament of Graubünden revoked the expulsion.

==Later years and emigration to Israel==

After his release from prison, Frankfurter had to leave Switzerland, and he migrated to the British Mandate of Palestine. 

There Frankfurter settled in Tel Aviv. He later became an employee of the Israeli Minister of Defence and later an officer in the Israeli Army. He lived and worked in several Israeli cities until his death in 1982.

==Death==
Frankfurter died in Israel, in the city of Ramat Gan on 19 July 1982, aged 73.

==Legacy and representation in other media==
Several books were written about the Gustloff assassination. 

Frankfurter published two memoirs. The first in German called &quot;Rache&quot; (&quot;revenge&quot;) and the second in English, called &quot;The First Fighter against Nazism&quot;. 

Frankfurter&#x27;s assassination of Gustloff is the subject of the Swiss film &quot;Assassination in Davos&quot; (1975), which gives an account of events. Much of the film is devoted to Frankfurter&#x27;s trial. The film ends with documentary footage of David Frankfurter living in Israel.

In Israel, Frankfurter has been hailed as a hero. After his death, several cities named streets or parks after him.

<doc id="348714" wikidata="Q287057" url="?curid=348714" title="John D. MacArthur">
<text>John Donald MacArthur (March 6, 1897 – January 6, 1978) was an American insurance magnate, real estate investor and philanthropist who established the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, benefactor in the MacArthur Fellowships.

==Early life==
John Donald MacArthur was born on March 6, 1897, in Pittston, Pennsylvania, as the seventh child to Georginna and Reverend William Telfer MacArthur. He moved from Pittston to Chicago, Illinois, at the age of five. He and his many siblings grew up in poverty, the children of an itinerant Baptist preacher and his resourceful wife. His father went through many evangelical trainings, moving his family all around the country, from Chicago to Nyack, New York, to Springfield, Massachusetts. His sister-in-law was the actress Helen Hayes. His brother, American playwright and Academy Award winning screenwriter Charles MacArthur, co-authored the play &quot;The Front Page&quot;. John MacArthur dropped out of school after eighth grade and became a salesman.

==Career==
===World War I===
MacArthur joined the U.S. Navy and then the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War I. He was medically discharged from service.

===Insurance career===
MacArthur made his fortune in the mail-order insurance business. He acquired the Bankers Life and Casualty Company, an insurance company defeated by the Great Depression, in 1935 after borrowing $2,500, then went on to build a business empire by acquiring many small insurance corporations. In the 1950s he signed famed broadcaster Paul Harvey as his company&#x27;s radio spokesperson.

===Real estate investments in Florida===
MacArthur also increased his vast fortune by heavily and lucratively investing in Florida real estate. By the time of his death, he owned 100,000 acres of real estate in Florida. In 1954 for $5.5 million MacArthur bought of land in northern Palm Beach County originally owned by Harry Seymor Kelsey and later by Sir Harry Oakes. It included most of today&#x27;s Lake Park, North Palm Beach, Palm Beach Gardens and Palm Beach Shores. For many years, MacArthur conducted his business affairs from a corner table in the Colonnades Beach Hotel coffee shop, in Singer Island in Palm Beach Shores, where he and his wife lived in an apartment above the bar, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and the Lake Worth Lagoon.

==Personal life==
MacArthur first married the former Louise Ingalls and had two children: a son, U.S. businessman and philanthropist J. Roderick (1920–1984); and a daughter, Virginia. The couple divorced in 1937. In 1938 MacArthur married his secretary, Catherine T. MacArthur (née Hyland), who for decades intimately involved herself in the management of his companies, and after whom his charitable foundation is co-named.

John R. MacArthur, the president of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and son of J. Roderick MacArthur, is a grandson of John D. MacArthur.

==Death==
On January 6, 1978, he died of pancreatic cancer at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach, Florida.

==Legacy==
=== John D. MacArthur Beach State Park ===

John D. MacArthur Beach State Park in North Palm Beach, Florida, opened to the public in 1989.

=== John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation ===
John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation is one of the largest (when ranked by asset value) private foundations in the United States.

==Awards and honors==
In 1977, MacArthur received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. The award was presented to him by Awards Council member Helen Hayes.

<text>Highgate is a London Underground station and former railway station in Archway Road, in the London Borough of Haringey in north London. The station takes its name from nearby Highgate Village. It is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line, between East Finchley and Archway stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 3.

The station was originally opened in 1867, on the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s line between Finsbury Park and Edgware stations. As part of their only partially completed Northern Heights plan, the London Underground started serving the station in 1941, using new platforms in tunnels beneath the surface station. The platforms of the surface station remain, but were last used in 1954; the section of the line through them to Finsbury Park was closed in 1970 and lifted by 1972. One of the original 1867 station buildings still exists and is in use as a private house.

Highgate station was originally constructed by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway in the 1860s on its line from Finsbury Park station to Edgware station. Before the line was opened, it was purchased in July 1867 by the larger Great Northern Railway (GNR), whose main line from King&#x27;s Cross ran through Finsbury Park on its way to Potters Bar and the north. The station opened along with the railway to Edgware on 22 August 1867.

Due to the hilly terrain, the station was built in a deep cutting excavated from Highgate Hill, adjacent to Archway Road. Tunnels penetrated the hillside at each end of the station, leading towards East Finchley to the north and Crouch End to the south. When built, the station had two side platforms, with three tracks between them, and a station building on the south side. A footbridge linked the two platforms.

A branch line was constructed from Highgate to Alexandra Palace by the Muswell Hill Railway (MHR) and was opened on 24 May 1873. The new branch split from the original route north of the station in a wide arc around Highgate Wood. The next station on the branch line, when it opened, was Muswell Hill and an intermediate station was built later at Cranley Gardens in 1902.

In the 1880s, the station was rebuilt, with two tracks flanking a central island platform instead of the two side platforms. The island platform was accessed from a ticket office in the middle of the footbridge. In 1911, the MHR branch was taken over by the GNR. After the Railways Act 1921 created the &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies, the GNR became part of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923.

At the start of the 1930s, the station had around 54 trains daily from High Barnet, 43 from Alexandra Palace and a few through trains from Edgware. Services ran to Finsbury Park and then either King&#x27;s Cross, Moorgate or Broad Street.
===Northern Heights project===

In 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) announced a proposal, which became known as the Northern Heights project. This was to take over the LNER lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace, then link them to both the Northern line at East Finchley and the Northern City line at Finsbury Park. The construction of the first phase of this project involved extending tube train services from the Northern line&#x27;s existing terminus at Archway station (then also called Highgate), through a new section of paired tunnels under Highgate station to emerge south of East Finchley station, where track connections to the LNER line were made.

To provide an interchange between the new deep-level platforms and the existing surface platforms, a subterranean concourse was constructed immediately beneath the existing station. The concourse was connected to the deep-level platforms with escalators and to the existing platforms by stairs. Street entrances to the concourse were provided from the south (Archway Road) and the north (Priory Gardens). At the same time, the buildings on the surface platforms were partly reconstructed and the footbridge was removed. Northern line services through the new tunnels to East Finchley started operating on 3 July 1939, although they did not stop at Highgate until later.
===Wartime===

Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, works to complete the electrification of the LNER lines were slowed or halted. The line from Finchley Central to Edgware closed for reconstruction on 11 September 1939. Northern line services were extended from East Finchley to High Barnet on 14 April 1940 and started serving the deep level platforms at Highgate on 19 January 1941, though not all of the new station buildings had been completed. The surface platforms at Highgate continued to be served by LNER steam trains.

The deep-level platforms were constructed long to accommodate extra-long nine-car trains, which were planned for services on the Northern line but never served Highgate, having been withdrawn at the start of the war. With the interchange between LNER and Northern line services available at Highgate from January 1941, LNER trains to East Finchley ended on 2 March 1941, after which they operated between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace only. In 1942, LNER services through Highgate were reduced to rush hour only operations. During the war, the deep-level platforms at Highgate were used, as many were, as a shelter from the bombing of London by the Luftwaffe and, later, V-1 and V-2 missiles.
===Post-war===

After the war, plans to complete the Northern Heights project were reviewed. In early 1946, the conversion of the LNER line from Mill Hill East to Edgware was scheduled by the LPTB for completion between January 1947 and June 1948. No work was carried out as maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and priority was given to the completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault. Despite being shown as under construction on Underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.

After a temporary closure between October 1951 and January 1952, British Railways (the successor to the LNER) ran the last passenger services between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace on 3 July 1954. British Railways freight traffic continued to pass through the station until 1964. After freight traffic ceased, the line continued to be used for occasional London Underground rolling stock transfers between Highgate depot and the Northern City line, with the stock being pulled over the unelectrified lines by battery locomotives. This ceased in 1970, due to the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, and the track was lifted through the surface platforms in 1972.

Completion of the station buildings was delayed for many years. Designed by the architect Charles Holden, the pre-war plans included a large entrance building at the top of the hill next to &quot;The Woodman&quot; public house with a pair of escalators between the entrance and the sub-surface concourse. These were to be enclosed in an inclined structure down the side of the cutting parallel with the surface tracks. Taking inspiration from the local legend, the building would have been topped by a statue of Dick Whittington and his cat. When works were finished in 1957, a single and upwards only escalator was provided to take passengers from the sub-surface ticket hall up to a simple exit at the top of the cutting.

One of the GNR&#x27;s station buildings remains on the north side of the surface platforms: it is used as a private residence. Much of the route between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace now forms part of the Parkland Walk, although this bypasses the station site for safety reasons.

On 2 May 2023, a fire broke out in the ground-level station.

=== Current station ===
The current station consists of a central subterranean ticket hall, with escalators leading down to 2 separate 9-car long platforms. There are 2 entrances to the station: one leading to Priory Gardens on the east and the Archway Road to the south. This entrance is directly opposite the Jacksons Lane Arts Centre. There is also a one-way escalator leading to a simple exit north of the station.

==Services and connections==
===Services===
The station is in Travelcard Zone 3, between Archway and East Finchley stations. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3–7 minutes between 06:01 and 01:01 northbound and 05:37 and 00:18 southbound (as of 2015).

===Connections===
As of 2024, London Bus routes 43, 134, 234 and night bus route N20 serve the station.
==Use in media==
The disused platforms and tunnels have sometimes been used for filming. They have appeared in several productions, including the feature film &quot;Paperhouse&quot; and the television series &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;.

==Births==
Jerry Springer, mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio, and later a TV host, was born at Highgate tube station in 1944 during a World War II bombing raid by the Luftwaffe.

<doc id="348725" wikidata="Q3758" url="?curid=348725" title="Kaiserslautern">
<text>Kaiserslautern (; ) is a town in southwest Germany, located in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate at the edge of the Palatinate Forest. The historic centre dates to the 9th century. It is from Paris, from Frankfurt am Main, 666 kilometers (414 miles) from Berlin, and from Luxembourg.

Kaiserslautern is home to about 100,000 people. Additionally, approximately 45,000 NATO military personnel are based in the city and its surrounding district (&quot;Landkreis Kaiserslautern&quot;).

==History and demographics==
Prehistoric settlement in the area of what is now Kaiserslautern has been traced to at least 800 BC. Some 2,500-year-old Celtic tombs were uncovered at Miesau, a town about west of Kaiserslautern. The recovered relics are now in the Museum for Palatinate History at Speyer.

===Medieval period===
Kaiserslautern received its name from the favourite hunting retreat of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa who ruled the Holy Roman Empire from 1155 until 1190. The small river Lauter made the old section of Kaiserslautern an island in medieval times. Ruins of Frederick&#x27;s original castle, built 1152–1160, can still be seen in front of the &quot;Rathaus&quot; (city hall). A second castle, Nanstein Castle, was built at Landstuhl to guard the western approach to the city. Barbarossa&#x27;s influence on Kaiserslautern remains today, in its nickname as a &quot;Barbarossa city&quot;. Local legends claim in 1497, a nearly 6 m long pike was caught in a lake, the Kaiserwoog, with a ring saying it was placed by Emperor Frederick II, personally in 1230, later finding its way onto the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

The &quot;Stiftkirche&quot;, Kaiserslautern&#x27;s oldest church, was constructed in 1250–1350. As the population of Kaiserslautern grew, King Rudolf von Habsburg chartered the town an imperial city in 1276. St. Martin&#x27;s Church was built in the 14th century, originally as a Franciscan monastery church. Today a section of the original city wall still stands in the courtyard of the church.

By 1375, the city of Kaiserslautern was pledged to Electoral Palatinate and therefore became subsequently part of the Wittelsbach inheritance.

===Reformation===
In 1519, Franz von Sickingen became the owner of Nanstein Castle. He became a Protestant, and in 1522 Nanstein was a stronghold for local nobles favouring the Reformation. Sickingen and the local nobles began their battle against the Archbishop of Trier; but the attack was unsuccessful, and they retreated to Nanstein. Nanstein was then besieged by cannon-armed German Catholic princes. Sickingen died after the castle surrendered, and the Protestant nobility of the Electoral Palatinate were subdued by the Catholic princes.

Count of the Electoral Palatinate Johann Casimir, came to Kaiserslautern during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). Spanish occupation in 1621–1632 ended when Protestant Swedish armies liberated the area. The city would fall to invading forces again in an especially violent incident in 1635. Croatian troops within the Austrian emperor&#x27;s army plundered the city, killing 3,000 of its 3,200 residents. It would not be repopulated for about another 160 years.

Conflict did not end with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Elector of the Pfalz had difficulty with many of his subjects and ordered all castles, including Nanstein, destroyed. The French repeatedly invaded and occupied the area, residing in Kaiserslautern in 1686–1697. Nevertheless, after the treaty of Utrecht it was restored to be part of the Palatinate. During the unquiet episodes in the 18th century, the Palatinate was the scene of fighting between French and German troops of different states. In 1713, the French destroyed Barbarossa&#x27;s castle and the city&#x27;s wall towers. From 1793 until Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at Waterloo in 1815, the area was under French administration.

===Bavarian province===
As French power declined after 1815, Kaiserslautern and the Palatinate became a Bavarian province and remained so until 1918. After World War I, French troops again occupied the Palatinate for several years.

===World War II===
In World War II, Allied bombing destroyed more than 85% of Kaiserslautern. Today 25% of Kaiserslautern is made up by buildings from before 1945. The railway and several main roads were primary targets, with the heaviest attacks occurring on 7 January 11 August, and 28 September 1944. On 20 March 1945, as the last of the 1st Army crossed the Rhine at Remagen, the U.S. 80th Division, 319th Infantry, part of the 3rd US Army, seized Kaiserslautern without resistance. 
The city became part of the French occupation zone after the Second World War. The establishment of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate was ordered on 30 August 1946 as the last state in the western occupation zones by ordinance No. 57 of the French military government under General Marie-Pierre Kœnig. Little reconstruction took place until the currency reform of 1948. The pace of the economy remained slow until 1952, when construction for newly established garrisons of American troops brought economic growth to the area.

Unexploded ordnance from WWII continues to be discovered in and around Kaiserslautern. In May 2012 an unexploded Allied bomb was found, buried deeply and reportedly covered by water pipe, during a construction project in the downtown area of the city. On 5 September 2013, another WWII bomb was found during construction near the train station in Enkenbach-Alsenborn.

===Cold War era===
In the late 1940s, Kaiserslautern area became the largest U.S. garrison outside the United States (Kaiserslautern Military Community).

On 14 November 1956, a U.S. Air Force F-86 fighter jet crashed into the district office in the Burgstrasse / Maxstrasse area. In addition to the pilot, two civilians were killed, and numerous wounded.

With the incorporation of the previously independent communities of Dansenberg, Erfenbach, Erlenbach, Hohenecken, Mölschbach, Morlautern and Siegelbach on 7 June 1969, Kaiserslautern became a city. The University of Kaiserslautern was founded in 1970.

Industry flourished around the time of the first oil crisis (1973). In the 1970s, many industrial companies went through a crisis. In 1981, the spinning mill went bankrupt; Pfaff and Opel fired employees. The downsizing of the American garrison and the withdrawal of the French garrison cost more jobs.

==Climate==
Kaiserslautern has a moderate climate with adequate rainfall year-round. It is classified as a &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate) by the Köppen Climate Classification system. On 16 September 2020 the temperature reached 38,2 ° and reached the highest temperature since 1901.
==Culture, tourism, and sports==
Modern-day Kaiserslautern is a centre of information and communications technology, home to a well-known university, a technical college and many international research institutes located throughout the city. Kaiserslautern is a popular destination for tourists, offering a range of attractions, and sites for tourists to visit.

Town Hall Kaiserslautern is one of the tallest buildings and is located in the city centre. The bar and coffee shop on the top floor provides a panoramic view of the city and surrounding countryside.

The tallest building in the centre of Kaiserslautern is St. Mary&#x27;s, a Roman Catholic church, whilst the highest structure in all Kaiserslautern is the television tower in the suburb of Dansenberg, southwest of the city centre.
Kaiserslautern&#x27;s large botanical gardens feature a Japanese-style garden. Another unusual feature is the Waschmühle (also known as &quot;Wesch&quot;), an enormous public swimming pool that is the largest in Europe. There are several pedestrian-only shopping zones with numerous and varied restaurants and bars located in the city centre surrounding the old city (&quot;Altstadt&quot;). In the Altstadt you will find the &quot;Kaiserbrunnen&quot;, a large ornamental fountain with symbols of the city&#x27;s history such as a sewing machine, as produced by the Pfaff company in the city, a football representing the city&#x27;s football club and various animals that children can climb.

Kaiserslautern has a diverse culinary sector, offering visitors the chance to sample dishes from across the world.

Kaiserslautern is located in one of the largest contiguous forested areas in Central Europe, the Palatinate Forest, which offers numerous hiking trails and lakes to visitors.

===Notable attractions===

Pfalztheater Kaiserslautern

Local theatre Pfalztheater employs more than 300 people and features plays, operas, ballets, concerts, and musicals. The first German performance of &quot;West Side Story&quot; took place there. As the arts in Germany are significantly subsidized by the government, its ticket prices are reasonably low. Pfalztheater Kaiserslautern hosts the Else-Lasker-Schüler-Preis awards for German literature.

The Kammgarn

The Kammgarn is classified as a historical site. It served as a spinning factory before being transformed into the cultural heart of Kaiserslautern. This renovation has preserved its historical character while incorporating the latest sound and lighting technologies. The Kammgarn stands among the top venues in Germany and serves as a first-call club for rising groups and performers as well as established jazz, rock, blues and pop artists in Europe. Performances have included international stars B.B. King, Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band, Pat Metheny, Uriah Heep and Jan Garbarek.

Gartenschau (garden exhibition)

Better known as the &#x27;Dino Park&#x27; because of its lifesize dinosaur models, the Gartenschau is open from April through October and is popular with families. Having begun as a series of botanical displays and enjoying success at the first State Garden Exhibition of Rhineland-Palatinate in Kaiserslautern in 2000, this park has been transformed into one of the most multi-dimensional cultural centres in Germany.

Fritz-Walter-Stadion

The &quot;Fritz-Walter-Stadion&quot; is a football stadium that accommodates 48,500 fans. In June 2006, after renovation, the stadium was one of 12 to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup. It is also home to 1. FC Kaiserslautern, which won the Bundesliga four times and the wheelchair basketball team FCK Rolling Devils.

Kaiserslautern Zoo

The Kaiserslautern Zoo was founded in 1968 and is located in Kaiserslautern&#x27;s Siegelbach neighbourhood. It is home to many different animals including some nearly extinct regional species.

At the heart of the city is the large and old &quot;Stiftskirche&quot; (also Protestant). All three have large pipe organs and occasionally host concerts.

===Synagogues===
The city was once the site of the magnificent Moorish Revival Kaiserslautern synagogue. Built in 1886, the synagogue&#x27;s great dome could be seen from across the city skyline. The Nazi government forcibly demolished the synagogue on 31 August 1938. The reason provided for the synagogue&#x27;s demolition was to create a route for a Nazi parade, but the event served as an example of the Nazis&#x27; underlying intentions including ethnic cleansing in The Holocaust, even a few months before the Kristallnacht. A memorial archway was constructed at the site in 2002.

==US military base==
Between 1950 and 1955, Kaiserslautern developed into the largest US military community outside of the United States. For this reason Kaiserslautern is also referred to as &quot;K-town&quot;; a term coined by the early American military population who had difficulty pronouncing the name. The Kaiserslautern Military Community (KMC) is a combined community consisting of Army and Air Force components. The KMC consists of Army facilities at Kleber 32nd Air Defense HQ and Signal Corps, Panzer, Dänner-Kaserne, Landstuhl, Miesau, Einsiedlerhof, Pirmasens, Sembach, Baumholder, Rhine Ordnance Barracks and Pulaski Barracks along with Air Force facilities located at Ramstein Air Base, Vogelweh, and Kapaun Air Station.

<text>The John Llewellyn Rhys Prize was a literary prize awarded annually for the best work of literature (fiction, non-fiction, poetry, drama) by an author from the Commonwealth aged 35 or under, written in English and published in the United Kingdom. Established in 1942, it was one of the oldest literary awards in the UK.

Since 2011, the award has been suspended by funding problems. The last award was in 2010.

==History==
The prize was initiated in 1942 by Jane Oliver in memory of her husband, John Llewellyn Rhys, a young author who was killed on 5 August 1940 while serving as a bomber pilot in the Royal Air Force.

From 1987 to 2003, the prize was funded by the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;. The newspaper withdrew in 2003, after the initial winner of 2002 prize, Hari Kunzru, rejected the prize and criticised the Mail of Sunday for &quot;hostility towards black and Asian people&quot; Subsequently, the prize was sponsored by Booktrust, an independent educational charity, but in June 2011 the award was suspended due to funding problems. Booktrust said that it &quot;strongly&quot; intended to bring the award &quot;back with a bang as soon as possible&quot; as it looked for outside funding sources.

In 2010, the winner received £5,000, while the runners-up each received £500.
