<text>Joseph Papp (born Joseph Papirofsky; June 22, 1921 – October 31, 1991) was an American theatrical producer and director. He established The Public Theater in what had been the Astor Library Building in Lower Manhattan. There Papp created a year-round producing home to focus on new plays and musicals. Among numerous examples of these were the works of David Rabe, Ntozake Shange&#x27;s &quot;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf&quot;, Charles Gordone&#x27;s &quot;No Place to Be Somebody&quot; (the first off-Broadway play to win the Pulitzer Prize), and Papp&#x27;s production of Michael Bennett&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. Papp also founded Shakespeare in the Park, helped to develop other off-Broadway theatres and worked to preserve the historic Broadway Theatre District.

==Early life==
Papp was born as Joseph Papirofsky in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Yetta (née Miritch), a seamstress, and Samuel Papirofsky, a trunkmaker. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia. (The 2010 documentary film &quot;Joe Papp in Five Acts&quot; says his mother was a Lithuanian Jew, and his father a Polish Jew, as they immigrated from parts of former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth conquered by Russian Empire.) He was a high school student of Harlem Renaissance playwright Eulalie Spence. Papp was also the uncle of choreographer turned music video director Diane Martel.

==Career==
Papp founded the New York Shakespeare Festival (now called Shakespeare in the Park) in 1954 with the aim of making Shakespeare&#x27;s works accessible to the public. In 1957 he was granted the use of Central Park for free productions of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. These Shakespeare in the Park productions continue after his death at the open-air Delacorte Theatre every summer in Central Park.

=== Founder of the Public Theater ===

Papp spent much of his career promoting his idea of free Shakespeare in New York City. His 1956 production of &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot;, outdoors in the East River Amphitheatre on New York&#x27;s Lower East Side, was pivotal for Papp, primarily because critic Brooks Atkinson endorsed Papp&#x27;s vision in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Actress Colleen Dewhurst, who played the leading character, Kate, recalled the effect of this publicity (in an autobiography published posthumously as a collaboration with Tom Viola): 

By age 41, after Papp had established a permanent base for his free summer Shakespeare performances in Central Park&#x27;s Delacorte Theater, an open-air amphitheatre, Papp looked for an all-year theater he could make his own. After looking at other locations, he fell in love with the location and the character of Lafayette Street&#x27;s Astor Library. Papp rented it, in 1967, reportedly for one dollar per year, from the city. It was the first building saved from demolition under the New York City landmarks preservation law. After massive renovations, Papp moved his staff to the newly named Public Theater, hoping to attract a newer, less conventional audience for new and innovative playwrights.

At the Public Theater, Papp&#x27;s focus moved away from the Shakespeare classics and toward new work. Notable Public Theater productions included Charles Gordone&#x27;s &quot;No Place to Be Somebody&quot; (the first off-Broadway show, and the first play by an African American, to win the Pulitzer Prize) and the plays of David Rabe, Tom Babe and Jason Miller. Papp called his productions of Rabe&#x27;s plays &quot;the most important thing I did at the Public. Papp&#x27;s 1985 production of Larry Kramer&#x27;s play &quot;The Normal Heart&quot; addressed, in its time, the prejudicial political system which was turning its back on the AIDS crisis and the gay community. Designer Ming Cho Lee commented: &quot;With the new playwrights, the whole direction of the theater changed [but] none of us realized for a while. ... The Public Theater became more important than the Delacorte. The new playwrights became more interesting to Joe than Shakespeare.&quot;

Among all the plays and musicals that Papp produced, he is perhaps best known for four productions that later transferred to Broadway runs: &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, &quot;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf&quot; and &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. The last of these originated with a series of taped interviews, at the Public, of dancers&#x27; reminiscences, overseen by director/choreographer Michael Bennett. Papp had not kept the rights to produce &quot;Hair&quot;, and he did not gain from its Broadway transfer. But he kept the rights to &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, and the show&#x27;s earnings became a continuous financial support for Papp&#x27;s work. It received 12 Tony Award nominations and won nine of them, including Best Musical, in addition to the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It ran for 6,137 performances, becoming the longest-running production in Broadway history up to that time. The show pioneered the workshop system for developing musicals, revolutionizing the way Broadway musicals were created thereafter, and many of the precedents for workshops&#x27; aesthetics and contract agreements were set by Papp, Bennett and &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;.

=== Outdoor performances at the Delacorte Theatre ===

Delacorte Theatre productions introduced many new actors and actresses to outdoor Shakespeare and to New York audiences for free. Among the memorable performances (including some from before Papp had the Delacorte for his Shakespeare) were George C. Scott&#x27;s Obie-award-winning &quot;Richard III&quot; in 1958; Colleen Dewhurst&#x27;s Kate, Lady Macbeth, Cleopatra (opposite George C. Scott&#x27;s Mark Antony), and Gertrude; the Prince Hamlet of Stacy Keach opposite Dewhurst&#x27;s Gertrude with James Earl Jones&#x27; King Claudius, Barnard Hughes&#x27;s Polonius and Sam Waterston&#x27;s Laertes; Sam Waterston&#x27;s Hamlet (opposite the Gertrude of Ruby Dee) with the Laertes of John Lithgow and Andrea Marcovicci&#x27;s Ophelia; the Benedick and Beatrice of Sam Waterston and Kathleen Widdoes in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; with Barnard Hughes&#x27;s Keystone Cops version of &quot;Dogberry&quot;; the early work of Meryl Streep as Isabella in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;; Mary Beth Hurt as Randall Duk Kim&#x27;s daughter in &quot;Pericles&quot;; James Earl Jones as &quot;King Lear&quot; (1973) with Rosalind Cash and Ellen Holly as his wicked daughters; Raul Julia as Edmund in Jones&#x27; 1973 &quot;King Lear&quot;, as Osric to Keach&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and as Proteus (in a musical adaptation of &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; which transferred to a Broadway run). Julia also played Othello with Frances Conroy as his Desdemona and Richard Dreyfuss as Iago. And, in 1968, one year before his breakthrough in &quot;The Subject was Roses&quot;, Martin Sheen played Romeo. A complete list of the productions through 1995 is available in &quot;Joe Papp: An American Life&quot; by Helen Epstein.

Shakespeare in the Park was not exclusively for Shakespeare. In the summer of 1977 Gloria Foster was Clytemnestra in the Greek tragedy &quot;Agamemnon&quot; followed by Raul Julia as Macheath in Richard Foreman&#x27;s production of Bertolt Brecht/Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, which later transferred to Lincoln Center. Papp was also a Gilbert and Sullivan lover, and in 1980, to commemorate the centenary of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, he mounted a new staging of the opera at the Delacorte. The show was a sensation, and Papp transferred it to Broadway, where it ran for over 800 performances. It won Tony Awards for Best Revival, Best Director (Wilford Leach), and Best Actor (Kevin Kline). Linda Ronstadt was nominated for Best Actress in a Musical.

Papp was a pioneer in a commitment to non-traditional casting, using a variety of ethnicities and colors of actors in his new plays and Shakespeare productions. The father of a gay son, Tony, Papp aligned himself with gay and lesbian concerns in at least two specific instances. He fought anti-obscenity provisions that Congress briefly imposed on the National Endowment for the Arts during the Reagan Presidency, and he chose to produce &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;, which decried institutionalized &quot;homophobia&quot; as well as Mayor Koch&#x27;s response to the AIDS crisis.

=== Fostering the growth of New York theatre ===
Papp fostered other theatre throughout New York City, in particular the development of numerous Off Broadway theatres, often contributing funds from successful Broadway transfers, such as &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. These included Theatre for a New Audience, which presented several productions at the Delacourte, and the Riverside Shakespeare Company, in which Papp took a special interest, beginning with the sponsorship of the New York premiere of Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Edward II of England&quot; in 1982, continuing with the financial underwriting of Riverside&#x27;s New York Parks Tours of Free Shakespeare, including &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; in (1982), &quot;Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; in 1983, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1984, and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1985. In 1983, Papp dedicated the newly renovated theatre of The Shakespeare Center with Helen Hayes.

==&quot;Save the Theatres&quot; effort==

Papp took a keen interest in preservation of the historic Broadway/Times Square Theater District. In the early 1980s, he helped lead the &quot;Save the Theatres&quot; movement, and to found &quot;Save the Theatres, Inc.&quot;, along with a number of actors, directors, producers and other theatre, film and television personalities. The movement&#x27;s aim was to preserve vintage playhouses that were then being threatened with demolition by monied Manhattan development interests. Papp&#x27;s initiative was sparked by the impending demolition in 1982 of the historic Morosco and Helen Hayes theatres, as well as the old Piccadilly Hotel, on West 45th Street.

Although Papp was unsuccessful in saving the Morosco or the Helen Hayes, at his encouragement Congressman Donald J. Mitchell of New York introduced legislation in the United States Congress (97th Congress – H.R.6885) with 13 co-sponsors, to designate a &quot;Broadway/Times Square Theatre District National Historic Site&quot; in Manhattan. The Mitchell bill would have required the United States to provide assistance in the preservation of the historical, cultural, and architectural character of the site and in its restoration. It directed the National Park Service to designate theatre preservation sites and other appropriate real property within the site as national historic landmarks if they met the criteria for national historic landmarks, and would have prohibited the demolition or alteration of real property located within the site unless such demolition or alteration would contribute to the preservation, restoration, or enhancement of the site for traditional legitimate theatre purposes. Among other things, it would have established a Federally chartered citizens advisory group to be chaired by Papp, known as the &quot;Broadway/Times Square Theatre District Preservation Commission&quot;.

Faced with fierce opposition and extensive lobbying against its passage by Mayor Ed Koch&#x27;s administration and Manhattan developers, the bill was not enacted into law, but the ultimate effect of the &quot;Save the Theatres&quot; effort was to slow destruction of the old Theater District enough to eventually ensure preservation of a number of other historic playhouses and a measure of the District&#x27;s original atmosphere and historic character.

== Death ==
Joseph Papp died of prostate cancer at age 70, on October 31, 1991. He is buried in the Baron Hirsch Cemetery on Staten Island. His son, Tony, died of complications of AIDS only months before Joseph Papp&#x27;s death. Papp was survived by his fourth wife, Gail Merrifield Papp, a partner in the Public Theatre.

== Legacy ==
In large part due to the &quot;Save the Theatres&quot; preservation effort led by Papp in the 1980s, the Theater District remains one of New York City&#x27;s primary and most popular tourist attractions and destinations today.

In 2000 the Joseph Papp Children&#x27;s Humanitarian Fund was founded. The Fund serves as the humanitarian arm of international Jewish children&#x27;s club Tzivos Hashem&#x27;s activities in Ukraine. Papp, along with Rabbi Marc Schneier, co-founded the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding to strengthen ties between Blacks and Jews.

Papp&#x27;s biography &quot;Joe Papp: An American Life&quot; was written by journalist Helen Epstein and published in 1996.

William Finn&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Elegies: A Song Cycle&quot; includes the song &quot;Joe Papp,&quot; dedicated to Papp&#x27;s contributions to New York theatre and personal friendship with Finn.

<text>In computer programming, a third-party software component is a reusable software component developed to be either freely distributed or sold by an entity other than the original vendor of the development platform. The third-party software component market is supported by the belief that component-oriented development improves efficiency and quality when developing custom applications. Common third-party software includes macros, bots, and software/scripts to be run as add-ons for popular developing software. In the case of operating systems such as Windows XP, Vista or 7, there are applications installed by default, such as Windows Media Player or Internet Explorer.

<text>Lo que le pasó a Santiago (; &quot;What Happened to Santiago&quot;) is a 1989 Puerto Rican comedy film written and directed by Jacobo Morales. The film tells the story of a recently retired widower who meets a mysterious young lady who disrupts his daily routines.

It was the first and only Puerto Rican production to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 2011 AMPAS revised its rules to make films from U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico ineligible for the Foreign Language Film award.

==Plot==
Santiago, a widowed man, visits his wife&#x27;s grave at the cemetery. Near a movie filming location, Santiago encounters a mysterious woman. She is very pleasant and engages him in conversation. They exchange gifts, but upon parting ways, she leaves without revealing her name, leaving Santiago to ponder if he will ever see her again. They cross paths once more, and the woman, now identified as Angelina, continues to be amiable. Angelina discloses that she has been observing Santiago and mentions witnessing him mailing a letter to someone.

Santiago frequently argues with his daughter, primarily because she is undergoing a divorce, which he opposes. Later, during a dispute between his daughter and her husband in the presence of their young son, Santiago distracts the boy with conversation about snow, reminiscing about the only time he witnessed snow when it was airlifted to Puerto Rico. Santiago searches for employment but faces disinterest from an interviewer due to his age.

During their third encounter, Santiago and Angelina enjoy traditional guitar music and dancing. They later take a boat ride through a waterway in a park. Angelina exudes constant cheerfulness. Meanwhile, Santiago&#x27;s daughter remains contentious. At the airport, she informs Santiago of her plans to move to New York City for three months, leaving her son with her husband. However, her husband fails to show up, prompting her to leave the child with Santiago before departing. As Santiago leaves with his somber grandson, the boy&#x27;s father arrives to collect him.

One day, Santiago receives an unexpected call from Angelina on his landline. He had not given her his number, and she explains that she had to call every person in the phone book with his name to reach him. They arrange to meet in San Juan. Santiago&#x27;s son, Eddie, confesses his depression and reveals that he gave away his guitar. Santiago encourages him, expressing a desire to travel together for therapeutic reasons. Santiago also confides in Eddie about meeting Angelina but admits to hiring an investigator to learn more about her due to his concerns about her mysteriousness.

Early the next morning, Santiago visits Angelina&#x27;s grand Spanish-style home. As they share breakfast, Angelina reveals her family history, including her grandfather&#x27;s involvement in the Spanish-American War. Santiago reciprocates with details about his own life. They spend the day together until caught in a rainstorm, prompting them to retreat to Angelina&#x27;s bedroom. There, she offers Santiago a massage with rubbing alcohol, revealing to him that she is a ghost.

Despite this revelation, they declare their love for each other before parting ways. Santiago drives home in the rain, reflecting on seeing Angelina&#x27;s home and garden in his dreams. His car gets stuck in the mud, but he manages to free it using a stick he finds nearby. He arrives home to find his anxious son waiting for him, describing Angelina&#x27;s home as the most beautiful he&#x27;s ever seen.

After recovering from pneumonia, Santiago is visited by the investigator, who shares disturbing information about Angelina&#x27;s past. She was Lela, a woman who had endured a tragic life, including giving up her illegitimate child and shooting her father. Santiago recalls reading about her in the newspapers. Despite this revelation, Santiago continues his relationship with Angelina, keeping her secret to himself.

==Cast==
*Tommy Muñiz - Santiago Rodríguez
*Gladys Rodríguez - Angelina
*Jacobo Morales - Aristides Esquilín
*René Monclova - Eddie
*Johanna Rosaly - Nereida
*Roberto Vigoreaux - Gerardo

==Production==

Jacobo Morales wrote the script while working on the play &quot;Los muchachos de la alegría&quot;, an adaptation of a Neil Simon script, which featured Tommy Muñiz. As they were in rehearsals, Morales realized that Muñiz was the &quot;singular performer&quot; he wanted for his film project. He said in a 2014 interview that since he had the idea &quot;very clear, I wrote it really fast; like a little over a month&quot;. Morales invited Muñiz&#x27; son, Pedro, to serve as associate producer while Morales&#x27; wife, Blanca Silvia Eró, served as executive producer. Morales also chose Gladys Rodríguez to play opposite Muñiz, for considering her a very &quot;ductile&quot; actress with which he had worked for decades before. Morales said of Rodríguez, &quot;the experiences with her had been very positive and we had good communication. Her role not only suited her for her physicality, but also for her temperament.&quot;

Morales described the film as a very &quot;simple&quot; film with &quot;great performances from Tommy, Gladys, and René Monclova&quot;, who played Muñíz&#x27; son. The production had a budget of $500,000. Although Morales wrote the script fairly quickly, filming was delayed for around 40 days. According to Morales, at the time it was the only one of his feature films that had gone over its initially planned shooting schedule. It was filmed in Old San Juan and Santa Isabel.

== Release ==

The film&#x27;s original release was delayed because of the passage of Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. It was ultimately released in November of the same year. After receiving critical acclaim, the film was also exhibited in various international festivals, including the Festival de Cine Iberoamericano de Huelva in Spain, the Latin American Film Festival in Washington, and the Festival du Cinéma Espagnol de Nantes in France. According to Morales, he wasn&#x27;t &quot;thinking in success, but in a story that grabbed my attention. I always try to do everything in function of the story. The star is the film&quot;.

== Reception ==

&quot;Lo que le pasó a Santiago&quot; was generally well received by critics and audiences. Although it doesn&#x27;t have an official rating on Rotten Tomatoes because of the lack of certified critics reviews, it still holds an approval rating of 81% among the audience based on 417 ratings. In 1990, the film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Academy Awards. According to Morales, it was associate producer, Pedro Muñiz, who prompted them to submit the film for consideration. Before submitting it to the Academy, they had to budget the addition of English subtitles, which they did in &quot;record time&quot; and the film was successfully submitted before the January 5, 1990 deadline. However, it lost to Giuseppe Tornatore&#x27;s &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;.

<doc id="349223" wikidata="Q2602722" url="?curid=349223" title="Group ring">
<text>In algebra, a group ring is a free module and at the same time a ring, constructed in a natural way from any given ring and any given group. As a free module, its ring of scalars is the given ring, and its basis is the set of elements of the given group. As a ring, its addition law is that of the free module and its multiplication extends &quot;by linearity&quot; the given group law on the basis. Less formally, a group ring is a generalization of a given group, by attaching to each element of the group a &quot;weighting factor&quot; from a given ring.

If the ring is commutative then the group ring is also referred to as a group algebra, for it is indeed an algebra over the given ring. A group algebra over a field has a further structure of a Hopf algebra; in this case, it is thus called a group Hopf algebra.

The apparatus of group rings is especially useful in the theory of group representations.

==Definition==
Let formula_1 be a group, written multiplicatively, and let formula_2 be a ring. The group ring of formula_1 over formula_2, which we will denote by formula_5, or simply formula_6, is the set of mappings formula_7 of finite support (formula_8 is nonzero for only finitely many elements formula_9), where the module scalar product formula_10 of a scalar formula_11 in formula_2 and a mapping formula_13 is defined as the mapping formula_14, and the module group sum of two mappings formula_13 and formula_9 is defined as the mapping formula_17. To turn the additive group formula_5 into a ring, we define the product of formula_13 and formula_9 to be the mapping
:formula_21
The summation is legitimate because formula_13 and formula_9 are of finite support, and the ring axioms are readily verified.

Some variations in the notation and terminology are in use. In particular, the mappings such as formula_24 are sometimes written as what are called &quot;formal linear combinations of elements of formula_1 with coefficients in formula_2
:formula_27
or simply
:formula_28

Note that if the ring formula_2 is in fact a field formula_30, then the module structure of the group ring formula_6 is in fact a vector space over formula_30.

==Examples==
1. Let , the cyclic group of order 3, with generator formula_33 and identity element 1&quot;G&quot;. An element &quot;r&quot; of C[&quot;G&quot;] can be written as

:formula_34

where &quot;z&quot;0, &quot;z&quot;1 and &quot;z&quot;2 are in C, the complex numbers. This is the same thing as a polynomial ring in variable formula_33 such that formula_36 i.e. C[&quot;G&quot;] is isomorphic to the ring C[formula_33]/formula_38.

Writing a different element &quot;s&quot; as formula_39, their sum is

:formula_40

and their product is

:formula_41

Notice that the identity element 1&quot;G&quot; of &quot;G&quot; induces a canonical embedding of the coefficient ring (in this case C) into C[&quot;G&quot;]; however strictly speaking the multiplicative identity element of C[&quot;G&quot;] is 1⋅1&quot;G&quot; where the first &quot;1&quot; comes from C and the second from &quot;G&quot;. The additive identity element is zero.

When &quot;G&quot; is a non-commutative group, one must be careful to preserve the order of the group elements (and not accidentally commute them) when multiplying the terms.

2. The ring of Laurent polynomials over a ring &quot;R&quot; is the group ring of the infinite cyclic group Z over &quot;R&quot;.

3. Let &quot;Q&quot; be the quaternion group with elements formula_42. Consider the group ring R&quot;Q&quot;, where R is the set of real numbers. An arbitrary element of this group ring is of the form

:formula_43
where formula_44 is a real number.

Multiplication, as in any other group ring, is defined based on the group operation. For example,

:formula_45

Note that RQ&quot; is not the same as the skew field of quaternions over R. This is because the skew field of quaternions satisfies additional relations in the ring, such as formula_46, whereas in the group ring RQ&quot;, formula_47 is not equal to formula_48. To be more specific, the group ring R&quot;Q&quot; has dimension 8 as a real vector space, while the skew field of quaternions has dimension 4 as a real vector space.

4. Another example of a non-abelian group ring is formula_49 where formula_50 is the symmetric group on 3 letters. This is not an integral domain since we have formula_51 where the element formula_52 is the transposition that swaps 1 and 2. Therefore the group ring need not be an integral domain even when the underlying ring is an integral domain.

==Some basic properties==
Using 1 to denote the multiplicative identity of the ring &quot;R&quot;, and denoting the group unit by 1&quot;G&quot;, the ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] contains a subring isomorphic to &quot;R&quot;, and its group of invertible elements contains a subgroup isomorphic to &quot;G&quot;. For considering the indicator function of {1&quot;G&quot;}, which is the vector &quot;f&quot; defined by
:formula_53
the set of all scalar multiples of &quot;f&quot; is a subring of &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] isomorphic to &quot;R&quot;. And if we map each element &quot;s&quot; of &quot;G&quot; to the indicator function of {&quot;s&quot;}, which is the vector &quot;f&quot; defined by
:formula_54
the resulting mapping is an injective group homomorphism (with respect to multiplication, not addition, in &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]).

If &quot;R&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are both commutative (i.e., &quot;R&quot; is commutative and &quot;G&quot; is an abelian group), &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] is commutative.

If &quot;H&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;R&quot;[&quot;H&quot;] is a subring of &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]. Similarly, if &quot;S&quot; is a subring of &quot;R&quot;, &quot;S&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] is a subring of &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;].

If &quot;G&quot; is a finite group of order greater than 1, then &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] always has zero divisors. For example, consider an element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;G&quot; of order . Then 1 − &quot;g&quot; is a zero divisor:
formula_55

For example, consider the group ring Z[&quot;S&quot;3] and the element of order 3 &quot;g&quot; = (123). In this case,
formula_56
A related result: If the group ring formula_57 is prime, then &quot;G&quot; has no nonidentity finite normal subgroup (in particular, &quot;G&quot; must be infinite).

Proof: Considering the contrapositive, suppose formula_58 is a nonidentity finite normal subgroup of formula_59. Take formula_60. Since formula_61 for any formula_62, we know formula_63, therefore formula_64. Taking formula_65, we have formula_66. By normality of formula_58, formula_68 commutes with a basis of formula_57, and therefore
:formula_70.
And we see that formula_71 are not zero, which shows formula_57 is not prime. This shows the original statement.

==Group algebra over a finite group==
Group algebras occur naturally in the theory of group representations of finite groups. The group algebra &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] over a field &quot;K&quot; is essentially the group ring, with the field &quot;K&quot; taking the place of the ring. As a set and vector space, it is the free vector space on &quot;G&quot; over the field &quot;K&quot;. That is, for &quot;x&quot; in &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;],
:formula_73

The algebra structure on the vector space is defined using the multiplication in the group:
:formula_74
where on the left, &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot; indicate elements of the group algebra, while the multiplication on the right is the group operation (denoted by juxtaposition).

Because the above multiplication can be confusing, one can also write the basis vectors of &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] as &quot;e&quot;&quot;g&quot; (instead of &quot;g&quot;), in which case the multiplication is written as:
:formula_75

===Interpretation as functions===
Thinking of the free vector space as &quot;K&quot;-valued functions on &quot;G&quot;, the algebra multiplication is convolution of functions.

While the group algebra of a &quot;finite&quot; group can be identified with the space of functions on the group, for an infinite group these are different. The group algebra, consisting of &quot;finite&quot; sums, corresponds to functions on the group that vanish for cofinitely many points; topologically (using the discrete topology), these correspond to functions with compact support.

However, the group algebra &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] and the space of functions are dual: given an element of the group algebra

:formula_76

and a function on the group these pair to give an element of &quot;K&quot; via

:formula_77

which is a well-defined sum because it is finite.

=== Representations of a group algebra ===
Taking &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] to be an abstract algebra, one may ask for representations of the algebra acting on a &quot;K-&quot;vector space &quot;V&quot; of dimension &quot;d&quot;. Such a representation

:formula_78

is an algebra homomorphism from the group algebra to the algebra of endomorphisms of &quot;V&quot;, which is isomorphic to the ring of &quot;d × d&quot; matrices: formula_79. Equivalently, this is a left &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module over the abelian group &quot;V&quot;.

Correspondingly, a group representation

:formula_80

is a group homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to the group of linear automorphisms of &quot;V&quot;, which is isomorphic to the general linear group of invertible matrices: formula_81. Any such representation induces an algebra representation

:formula_82

simply by letting formula_83 and extending linearly. Thus, representations of the group correspond exactly to representations of the algebra, and the two theories are essentially equivalent.

=== Regular representation ===

The group algebra is an algebra over itself; under the correspondence of representations over &quot;R&quot; and &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] modules, it is the regular representation of the group.

Written as a representation, it is the representation &quot;g&quot; &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;g&quot; with the action given by formula_84, or

:formula_85

===Semisimple decomposition===
The dimension of the vector space &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] is just equal to the number of elements in the group. The field &quot;K&quot; is commonly taken to be the complex numbers C or the reals R, so that one discusses the group algebras C[&quot;G&quot;] or R[&quot;G&quot;].

The group algebra C[&quot;G&quot;] of a finite group over the complex numbers is a semisimple ring. This result, Maschke&#x27;s theorem, allows us to understand C[&quot;G&quot;] as a finite product of matrix rings with entries in C. Indeed, if we list the complex irreducible representations of &quot;G&quot; as &quot;Vk&quot; for &quot;k&quot; = 1, . . . , &quot;m&quot;, these correspond to group homomorphisms formula_86 and hence to algebra homomorphisms formula_87. Assembling these mappings gives an algebra isomorphism
:formula_88
where &quot;dk&quot; is the dimension of &quot;Vk&quot;. The subalgebra of C[&quot;G&quot;] corresponding to End(&quot;Vk&quot;) is the two-sided ideal generated by the idempotent
:formula_89
where formula_90 is the character of &quot;Vk&quot;. These form a complete system of orthogonal idempotents, so that formula_91, formula_92 for &quot;j ≠ k&quot;, and formula_93. The isomorphism formula_94 is closely related to Fourier transform on finite groups.

For a more general field &quot;K,&quot; whenever the characteristic of &quot;K&quot; does not divide the order of the group &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] is semisimple. When &quot;G&quot; is a finite abelian group, the group ring &quot;K&quot;[G] is commutative, and its structure is easy to express in terms of roots of unity.

When &quot;K&quot; is a field of characteristic &quot;p&quot; which divides the order of &quot;G&quot;, the group ring is &quot;not&quot; semisimple: it has a non-zero Jacobson radical, and this gives the corresponding subject of modular representation theory its own, deeper character.

===Center of a group algebra===
The center of the group algebra is the set of elements that commute with all elements of the group algebra:
:formula_95

The center is equal to the set of class functions, that is the set of elements that are constant on each conjugacy class
:formula_96

If , the set of irreducible characters of &quot;G&quot; forms an orthonormal basis of Z(&quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]) with respect to the inner product
:formula_97

==Group rings over an infinite group==
Much less is known in the case where &quot;G&quot; is countably infinite, or uncountable, and this is an area of active research. The case where &quot;R&quot; is the field of complex numbers is probably the one best studied. In this case, Irving Kaplansky proved that if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are elements of C[&quot;G&quot;] with , then . Whether this is true if &quot;R&quot; is a field of positive characteristic remains unknown.

A long-standing conjecture of Kaplansky (~1940) says that if &quot;G&quot; is a torsion-free group, and &quot;K&quot; is a field, then the group ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] has no non-trivial zero divisors. This conjecture is equivalent to &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] having no non-trivial nilpotents under the same hypotheses for &quot;K&quot; and &quot;G&quot;.

In fact, the condition that &quot;K&quot; is a field can be relaxed to any ring that can be embedded into an integral domain.

The conjecture remains open in full generality, however some special cases of torsion-free groups have been shown to satisfy the zero divisor conjecture. These include:

* Unique product groups (e.g. orderable groups, in particular free groups)
* Elementary amenable groups (e.g. virtually abelian groups)
* Diffuse groups – in particular, groups that act freely isometrically on &quot;R&quot;-trees, and the fundamental groups of surface groups except for the fundamental groups of direct sums of one, two or three copies of the projective plane.

The case where &quot;G&quot; is a topological group is discussed in greater detail in the article Group algebra of a locally compact group.

==Category theory==

===Adjoint===
Categorically, the group ring construction is left adjoint to &quot;group of units&quot;; the following functors are an adjoint pair:
:formula_98
:formula_99
where formula_100 takes a group to its group ring over &quot;R&quot;, and formula_101 takes an &quot;R&quot;-algebra to its group of units.

When , this gives an adjunction between the category of groups and the category of rings, and the unit of the adjunction takes a group &quot;G&quot; to a group that contains trivial units: In general, group rings contain nontrivial units. If &quot;G&quot; contains elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; such that formula_102 and &quot;b&quot; does not normalize formula_103 then the square of

:formula_104

is zero, hence formula_105. The element is a unit of infinite order.

=== Universal property ===
The above adjunction expresses a universal property of group rings. Let be a (commutative) ring, let be a group, and let be an -algebra. For any group homomorphism formula_106, there exists a unique -algebra homomorphism formula_107 such that formula_108 where is the inclusion

:formula_109

In other words, formula_110 is the unique homomorphism making the following diagram commute:

Any other ring satisfying this property is canonically isomorphic to the group ring.

=== Hopf algebra ===
The group algebra &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] has a natural structure of a Hopf algebra. The comultiplication is defined by formula_111, extended linearly, and the antipode is formula_112, again extended linearly.

===Generalizations===
The group algebra generalizes to the monoid ring and thence to the category algebra, of which another example is the incidence algebra.

==Filtration==

If a group has a length function – for example, if there is a choice of generators and one takes the word metric, as in Coxeter groups – then the group ring becomes a filtered algebra.

<text>The Beas River is a river in northwestern India, flowing through the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, and is the smallest of the five major rivers of the Punjab region. Rising in the Himalayas in central Himachal Pradesh, the river flows for approximately into the Sutlej River in Punjab. Its total length is and its drainage basin is large.

As of 2017, the river is home to a tiny isolated population of the Indus dolphin.

==Etymology==
Rig-veda calls the river &quot;Vipāś&quot;, which means unfettered,
in later Sanskrit texts it&#x27;s been called &quot;Vipāśā&quot; विपाशा. Yāska identifies it with Argrikiya.

According to legends,Veda Vyasa, the author of the Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, is the eponym of the river Beas; he is said to have created it from its source lake, the Beas Kund.

According to other legends, before Veda Vyasa, the Vipasa river was known as Saraswati. Rishi Vashishta, the great grandfather of Vyasa tried to jump into this river from an overlooking hillock, to sacrifice his soul. He tied himself with several cords to drown himself. However, the river altered form to become a sandbed, saving him. And in this course, the cords got broken, so Vashishta named the river Vipasa, which means cord-breaker. On account of this incident, the great Rishi opted to settle near the river, and made it a residence for some years. Thereby, it became known as Vashisht (after Vashishta). We can find Vashishta Brahmarishi Temple in this village.

Ancient Greeks called it &quot;Hyphasis&quot; (). Plinius called it Hypasis, an approximation to the Vedic &quot;Vipāś&quot;. Other classical names are Hynais, Bipasis, Bibasis.

In modern times, the river has also been called Bias or Bejah.

==History==

The Beas River marks the easternmost border of Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquests in 326 BC. It was one of the rivers which created problems in Alexander&#x27;s invasion of India. His troops mutinied here in 326 BC, refusing to go any further. Alexander shut himself in his tent for three days, but when his men did not change their desires he gave in, raising twelve colossal altars to mark the limit and glory of his expedition.

According to the &quot;Kavyamimansa&quot; of Rajasekhara, the kingdom-territories of the Gurjara-Pratihara monarch Mahipala I extended as far as the upper course of the river Beas in the north-west.

In the 20th century, the river was developed under the Beas Project for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation purposes. The second-phase Pong Dam was completed in 1974 followed by the first-phase upstream, Pandoh Dam in 1977. The Pong Dam served initially to primarily provide irrigation below Talwara but was soon developed as well for power generation; its power station with six turbines has now been upgraded to 396 MW installed capacity. Initially, the installed capacity was 360 MW . The Pandoh Dam diverts the river through a system of tunnels and channels to the 990 MW Dehar Power Station on the Sutlej River, connecting both rivers.

The Shahnehar canal takes off from the Shahnehar barrage/headwork which is located just downstream of Pong dam to supply water for irrigation needs and four cascading power houses at the canal drops before releasing water further downstream in the Beas river. These power stations, named Mukerian hydel (12 units), has 207 MW total generating capacity.

At the confluence with the Sutlej river, Harike barrage was constructed to divert the combined water flows of both rivers to irrigation canals to serve Rajasthan and Punjab areas.

==Course==
The river rises above sea-level on the southern face of Rohtang Pass in Kullu. It traverses the Mandi District and enters the Kangra District at Sandhol, above sea-level. During its lower course the Beas is crossed by numerous ferries, many of which consist of inflated skins (darais). Near Reh in Kangra District it divides into three channels, which reunite after passing Mirthal, above sea-level. On meeting the Sivalik Hills in Hoshiarpur, the river sweeps sharply northward, forming the boundary with Kangra District. Then bending round the base of the Sivalik Hills, it takes the southerly direction, separating the districts of Gurdaspur and Hoshiapur. After touching the Jalandhar district for a short distance, the river forms the boundary between Amritsar and Kapurthala. Finally the Beas joins the river Sutlej at the south-western boundary of Kapurthala district of Punjab after a total course of . The chief tributaries are Bain, Banganga, Luni and Uhal.
The Sutlej continues into Pakistani Punjab and joins the Chenab River at Uch near Bahawalpur to form the Panjnad River; the latter in turn joins the Indus River at Mithankot.

The water of the Beas river is allocated to India under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan. The mean annual flow is 14.203 million acre feet (MAF).

==Incidents==
===2014 drowning===

On 8 June 2014, 24 engineering students and one tour operator drowned when the flood gates of the Larji dam were opened.

===Floods===
During 2023 monsoon, flooding in Beas caused substantial damages in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Damage to the state is estimated to be $1B, the loss of life is over 400, and little government relief is available to assist with social costs and recovery.

== Pollution ==
On May 17, 2018, countless number of fishes and other aquatic animals were found dead in Beas river due to release of molasses from a sugar mill situated on its shore at Kiri Afgana village in Gurdaspur district. Locals have noted that the river color has changed to rust brown and dead fishes were floating in the river. Punjab Pollution Control Board have ordered the closure of the factory and an enquiry has been initiated. Besides sealing, the sugar mill has been charged a fine of Rs. 25 lakh for this negligence.

<doc id="349228" wikidata="Q1339467" url="?curid=349228" title="Alphonsus (crater)">
<text>Alphonsus is an ancient impact crater on the Moon that dates from the pre-Nectarian era. (Older sources state that it is Nectarian in age.) It is located on the lunar highlands on the eastern end of Mare Nubium, west of the Imbrian Highlands, and slightly overlaps the crater Ptolemaeus to the north. To the southwest is the smaller Alpetragius. The crater name was approved by the IAU in 1935.

== Description ==
The surface of Alphonsus is broken and irregular along its boundary with Ptolemaeus. The outer walls are slightly distorted and possess a somewhat hexagonal form.

A low ridge system of deposited ejecta bisects the crater floor, and includes the steep central peak designated Alphonsus Alpha (α). This pyramid-shaped formation rises to a height of 1.5 km above the interior surface. It is not volcanic in origin, but rather is made of anorthosite like the lunar highlands.

The floor is fractured by an elaborate system of rilles and contains four or five smaller craters surrounded by a symmetric darker halo. These dark-halo craters are cinder cone-shaped and are believed by some to be volcanic in origin, although others think they were caused by impacts that excavated darker mare material from underneath the lighter lunar regolith.

==Exploration==
The Ranger 9 probe impacted in Alphonsus, a short distance to the northeast of the central peak. Harold Urey said of a close-up photograph of Alphonsus:

==Apollo Landing Site==
The dark-haloed craters along some of the rilles in the crater are thought to be volcanic vents, and during the Apollo program Alphonsus was considered as a possible landing site in order to possibly sample xenoliths of the lunar mantle from the vents. It was considered for Apollo 16 but the Descartes area was selected. It was one of the three final possible sites for Apollo 17, together with Gassendi crater and the Taurus-Littrow valley, but it was considered possibly &quot;contaminated&quot; with younger material from the nearby Imbrium basin.

==Transient lunar phenomena==
Alphonsus is one of the sites noted for transient lunar phenomena, as glowing red-hued clouds have been reported emanating from the crater. On October 26, 1956, the lunar astronomer Dinsmore Alter noted some blurring of the rilles on the floor of Alphonsus in the photographs he took in violet light. The same blurring did not occur in the infrared photographs he took at the same time. However, few professional astronomers found this evidence of volcanic activity on the Moon very convincing.

One astronomer who was intrigued by Alter&#x27;s observations was Nikolai A. Kozyrev, from the Soviet Union. In 1958 while Kozyrev was looking for volcanic phenomenon on the moon, he observed the formation of a mist-like cloud within Alphonsus. The spectrum of the area had been measured at this time, and displayed indications of carbon matter, possibly C2 gas. He believed this to be the result of volcanic or related activity. However no evidence for this phenomenon has been found from lunar missions, and the emission results have never been confirmed.

==Names==
Alphonsus is named after King Alfonso X of Castile (known as &quot;Alfonso the Wise&quot;), who had an interest in astronomy. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was given its name by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized; Riccioli originally named it &quot;Alphonsus Rex&quot; (&#x27;King Alfonso&#x27;), but the &#x27;Rex&#x27; was later dropped. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names. Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Ludovici XIV, Reg. Fran.&quot;, after Louis XIV of France, and Johannes Hevelius called it &quot;Mons Masicytus&quot; after a range of mountains in Lycia.

==Interior craters==

Five tiny craters in the northeastern part of Alphonsus&#x27; interior floor have been assigned names by the IAU. These are listed in the table below.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Alphonsus.

<doc id="349235" wikidata="Q1131154" url="?curid=349235" title="Copernicus (lunar crater)">
<text>Copernicus is a lunar impact crater located in eastern Oceanus Procellarum. It was named after the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. It typifies craters that formed during the Copernican period in that it has a prominent ray system.
It may have been created by debris from the breakup of the parent body of asteroid 495 Eulalia 800 million years ago.

== Characteristics==
Copernicus is visible using binoculars, and is located slightly northwest of the center of the Moon&#x27;s Earth-facing hemisphere. South of the crater is the Mare Insularum, and to the south-south west is the crater Reinhold. North of Copernicus are the Montes Carpatus, which lie at the south edge of Mare Imbrium. West of Copernicus is a group of dispersed lunar hills. Due to its relative youth, the crater has remained in a relatively pristine shape since it formed.

The circular rim has a discernible hexagonal form, with a d inner wall and a 30 km wide, sloping that descends nearly a kilometer to the surrounding mare. There are three distinct terraces visible, and arc-shaped landslides due to slumping of the inner wall as the crater debris subsided.

Most likely due to its recent formation, the crater floor has not been flooded by lava. The terrain along the bottom is hilly in the southern half while the north is relatively smooth. The central peaks consist of three isolated mountainous rises climbing as high as 1.2 km above the floor. These peaks are separated from each other by valleys, and they form a rough line along an east–west axis. Infrared observations of these peaks during the 1980s determined that olivine was the main mafic mineral.

Based on high-resolution images from Lunar Orbiter 5, Terry W. Offield of the U.S. Geological Survey described the crater as having,

The crater rays spread as far as 800 kilometers across the surrounding mare, overlying rays from the craters Aristarchus and Kepler. The rays are less distinct than the long, linear rays extending from Tycho, instead forming a nebulous pattern with plumy markings. In multiple locations the rays lie at glancing angles, instead of forming a true radial dispersal. An extensive pattern of smaller secondary craters can also be observed surrounding Copernicus, a detail that was depicted in a map by Giovanni Cassini in 1680. Some of these secondary craters form sinuous chains in the ejecta.

In 1966 the crater was photographed from an oblique angle by Lunar Orbiter 2 as one of 12 &quot;housekeeping&quot; pictures that were taken to advance the roll of film between possible astronaut landing sites being surveyed. At the time this detailed image of the lunar surface was termed by NASA scientist Martin Swetnick and subsequently quoted by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;one of the great pictures of the century.&quot;

The Apollo 12 mission landed south of Copernicus on mare basalts of Oceanus Procellarum that were believed to have been in the path of one of the crater&#x27;s rays, and scientists hoped cosmic ray exposure ages of soil samples would help constrain the crater age. The results were inconclusive, but not inconsistent with the estimated 800 million year age of crater formation. Copernicus itself was a possible landing site for the canceled Apollo 20 mission.
== Names ==
Copernicus is named after the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was given its name by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Riccioli awarded Copernicus a prominent crater despite the fact that, as an Italian Jesuit, he conformed with church doctrine in publicly opposing Copernicus&#x27;s heliocentric system. Riccioli justified the name by noting that he had symbolically thrown all the heliocentrist astronomers into the Ocean of Storms. However, astronomical historian Ewan Whitaker suspects that the prominence of Copernicus crater is a sign that Riccioli secretly supported the heliocentric system and was ensuring that Nicolaus Copernicus would receive a worthy legacy for future generations.

Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names. Pierre Gassendi named it Carthusia after the Chartreuse Mountains. Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Phillipi IV&quot; after Philip IV of Spain. And Johannes Hevelius named it &#x27;Etna M.&#x27; after Mount Etna.

Later the crater was nicknamed &quot;the Monarch of the Moon&quot; by lunar cartographer Thomas Gwyn Elger.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Copernicus.

Copernicus H, a typical &quot;dark-halo&quot; crater, was a target of observation by Lunar Orbiter 5 in 1967. Dark-halo craters were once believed to be volcanic in origin rather than the result of impacts. The Orbiter image showed that the crater had blocks of ejecta like other craters of similar size, indicating an impact origin. The halo results from excavation of darker material (mare basalt) at depth.

<doc id="349242" wikidata="Q651820" url="?curid=349242" title="Bill Owens (Colorado politician)">
<text>William Forrester Owens (born October 22, 1950) is an American former politician who served as the 40th Governor of Colorado, from 1999 to 2007. A member of the Republican Party, he was re-elected in 2002, amassing 62.6% of the vote, the largest Republican share of the vote in state history. As of 2025, he is the last Republican to serve as Governor of Colorado.

==Early life==
Owens was born in Fort Worth, Texas, where he graduated from Paschal High School. While a sophomore in high school, Owens was appointed a Page in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressman (and later, Speaker of the House) Jim Wright. Owens was assigned by the Doorkeeper of the House to the Republican cloakroom, where he worked for notable Republicans who were serving in the House then such as George H. W. Bush, Gerald Ford, and Bob Dole.

He attended Stephen F. Austin State University where he served as vice president and president of the student body. While at Stephen F. Austin, Owens served as a coordinator of the Students for George Bush in George H.W. Bush&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate. It was during this campaign that Owens would first meet future President George W. Bush. Owens earned a master&#x27;s degree in Public Affairs from the University of Texas, Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, where he was awarded a full two-year fellowship.

Following his graduate work, Owens accepted a position in the Washington, D.C., office of Touche Ross &amp; Company. He moved to Colorado in 1977, after accepting a position with the Gates Corporation. He later served as executive director of the Colorado Petroleum Association, and as Executive Vice President of the Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association.

===Early political career===

Owens served as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from 1982 until 1988, and as a state senator from 1988 to 1994, representing Aurora and Arapahoe County.

While in the Legislature, Owens was active in tax reform, privatization and school choice initiatives, sponsoring the nation&#x27;s third charter school law. He served as chair of both the House and Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committees and as Chair of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) Energy Committee, as well as on NCSL&#x27;s executive committee.

Owens was elected to statewide office as Colorado State Treasurer in 1994, where he was responsible for managing the state&#x27;s $5 billion in investment funds. He served during this time on the board of Colorado&#x27;s $25 billion pension fund, the Colorado Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA).

==Governorship==
===First term===

Owens was elected as the 40th Governor of Colorado in the 1998 governor&#x27;s race, when he defeated Democratic opponent Gail Schoettler by 8,300 votes (less than one percent of ballots cast). When he was inaugurated on January 12, 1999, Owens became Colorado&#x27;s first Republican governor in 24 years. His platform was three pronged: cut taxes, repair Colorado&#x27;s aging infrastructure, and continue school accountability reforms.

====Tax cuts====
Upon entering office, Owens worked with a legislature controlled by his own Republican party to push through the largest tax cut package in state history, amounting to $1 billion in rate cuts to the sales, personal-income, and capital-gains taxes. Owens also championed, and eventually won, the elimination of the state&#x27;s marriage penalty. By 2006, the Owens administration estimated the overall tax cuts pushed through during his administration was around $3.6 billion.

====TRANS and T-REX====
In November 1999, Owens brought his transportation funding initiative to the ballot. Called TRANS, the $1.7 billion bonding initiative accelerated future federal transportation dollars on 28 road projects across the state. The keystone project was the Transportation Expansion, dubbed T-REX.

T-REX combined new road funding from TRANS to widen and expand Interstate 25 through Denver with $460 million-worth of new light rail lines to link downtown Denver with the Denver Tech Center. Through an innovative design-build concept that greatly reduced construction times, T-REX was finished in less than five years, and came in under budget.

====Education reform====
Owens based his education reforms on expanding and empowering the already-established Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP), which had been created during the administration of Democratic predecessor Roy Romer. Owens added &quot;accountability reports&quot; to the tests, which provided parents with a &#x27;school report card&#x27; to allow them to better assess the performance of Colorado&#x27;s public schools. He also expanded Colorado&#x27;s charter school program (which he had sponsored as a state legislator in the 1990s).

===Second term===

Owens won reelection in the 2002 governor&#x27;s race by defeating Democratic nominee, Boulder businessman Rollie Heath, 64%–32%—the greatest majority in Colorado history. Shortly before the election, Owens was proclaimed by &quot;National Review&quot; as &quot;America&#x27;s Best Governor&quot;.

In the summer of 2002, when the Hayman Fire and Coal Seam Fire ravaged much of Western Colorado, Owens made perhaps the first major press faux-pas of his tenure. Responding to a reporter&#x27;s question following an aerial tour of the fires (&quot;What does it look like up there?&quot;), Owens said &quot;It looks as if all of Colorado is burning today&quot;. Many western slope residents blamed Owens for driving away tourists with the press&#x27;s truncated version of the quote (&quot;All of Colorado is burning&quot;).

In November 2003, Colorado voters rejected Owens’ water storage initiative, Referendum A, by 67% to 33%. The referendum failed to win a single county in the state, as opponents successfully savaged the measure as a &quot;blank check&quot;. Owens would later joke, &quot;it takes a particularly adept Governor to lose a water referendum in the face of a 300-year drought.&quot; While the initiative was supported by most Colorado newspapers and business groups, it was opposed by the environmental community and many on Colorado&#x27;s Western Slope who feared it would lead to the Front Range using more Western Slope water.

Leading up to the 2004 primary, Owens caused some controversy in the Republican Party by announcing support for Bob Schaffer&#x27;s run to replace retiring U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, but then endorsing Pete Coors when Coors later announced his entry two days later.

Democrat Bill Ritter was elected in November 2006 to replace the term-limited Owens.

====Referendum C====

In 2005, Owens faced what former governor Dick Lamm termed &quot;the test of his time.&quot; Conflicting budget measures in Colorado&#x27;s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR), which caps government spending, and the voter-endorsed Amendment 23, which mandates increases in education funding) combined with a nationwide recession to leave Colorado&#x27;s budget 17% below 2001 levels. A &quot;glitch&quot;, as Owens termed it, in TABOR prevented the budget from rebounding once the recession reversed.

Owens angered some conservatives by working with moderate Republican and Democratic legislators to craft and endorse what became known as Referendum C, essentially a 5-year timeout from TABOR&#x27;s spending restrictions. National conservative leaders such as Grover Norquist and Dick Armey publicly criticized the measure and Owens’ support thereof. Referendum C passed with 52% of the vote in November 2005.

While it was endorsed by every major newspaper in the state as well as the state Chamber of Commerce, it was nevertheless controversial. Owens served as Vice Chair and Chair of the Republican Governors Association, and was elected by his colleagues as chair of the Western Governors Association.

He debated public policy in person including well publicized debates with Democratic Chair Howard Dean on the Patriot Act before the ACLU National Convention in San Francisco; with Dr. Larry Summers at the Aspen Institute; with former Illinois Governor George Ryan on the death penalty at Michigan State University; with ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero on the Patriot Act at Northwestern State University; and with Justice Adrian Hardiman, the former Chief Justice of the Irish Supreme Court on the death penalty at the University College Dublin, Ireland.

Owens was a regular participant and panelist at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing in 2005 on a panel debating U.S. foreign policy with Senators Joe Biden and Chris Dodd.

==Post-political career==
Owens currently serves as a senior director at the international law firm of Greenberg Traurig, LLP where he works on public policy and regulatory issues. He is on a number of public boards including Key Energy (NYSE:KEG); Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE); Bill Barrett Corporation (NYSE:BBG), and Federal Signal (NYSE:FSS).

Owens currently works with Renewable Water Resources (RWR), a company proposing the export of water from Colorado&#x27;s San Luis Valley.

Owens formerly served as chairman of the board for Credit Bank of Moscow (MOEX:CBOM), but stepped down on February 27, 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Owens joined the University of Denver&#x27;s Institute for Public Policy Studies in January 2007 as a senior fellow.

Owens was an early supporter of Mitt Romney&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. After Romney dropped out of the race, Owens worked actively for John McCain&#x27;s campaign. He endorsed Romney again for the 2012 Republican nomination and served as co-chair of Romney&#x27;s Colorado campaign.

==Family life==
Owens married Frances Owens in January 1975, and divorced in 2010. The couple has three children, Monica Owens-Beauprez, Mark, and Brett.

<doc id="349251" wikidata="Q189791" url="?curid=349251" title="Diagonal">
<text>In geometry, a diagonal is a line segment joining two vertices of a polygon or polyhedron, when those vertices are not on the same edge. Informally, any sloping line is called diagonal. The word &quot;diagonal&quot; derives from the ancient Greek διαγώνιος &quot;diagonios&quot;, &quot;from corner to corner&quot; (from διά- &quot;dia-&quot;, &quot;through&quot;, &quot;across&quot; and γωνία &quot;gonia&quot;, &quot;corner&quot;, related to &quot;gony&quot; &quot;knee&quot;); it was used by both Strabo and Euclid to refer to a line connecting two vertices of a rhombus or cuboid, and later adopted into Latin as &quot;diagonus&quot; (&quot;slanting line&quot;).

==Polygons==
As applied to a polygon, a diagonal is a line segment joining any two non-consecutive vertices. Therefore, a quadrilateral has two diagonals, joining opposite pairs of vertices. For any convex polygon, all the diagonals are inside the polygon, but for re-entrant polygons, some diagonals are outside of the polygon.

Any &quot;n&quot;-sided polygon (&quot;n&quot; ≥ 3), convex or concave, has formula_1 &quot;total&quot; diagonals, as each vertex has diagonals to all other vertices except itself and the two adjacent vertices, or diagonals, and each diagonal is shared by two vertices.

In general, a regular &quot;n&quot;-sided polygon has formula_2 &quot;distinct&quot; diagonals in length, which follows the pattern 1,1,2,2,3,3... starting from a square.

===Regions formed by diagonals===

In a convex polygon, if no three diagonals are concurrent at a single point in the interior, the number of regions that the diagonals divide the interior into is given by

:formula_3

For &quot;n&quot;-gons with &quot;n&quot;=3, 4, ... the number of regions is
:1, 4, 11, 25, 50, 91, 154, 246...

This is OEIS sequence A006522.

===Intersections of diagonals===
If no three diagonals of a convex polygon are concurrent at a point in the interior, the number of interior intersections of diagonals is given by formula_4. This holds, for example, for any regular polygon with an odd number of sides. The formula follows from the fact that each intersection is uniquely determined by the four endpoints of the two intersecting diagonals: the number of intersections is thus the number of combinations of the &quot;n&quot; vertices four at a time.

===Regular polygons===
Although the number of distinct diagonals in a polygon increases as its number of sides increases, the length of any diagonal can be calculated. 

In a regular n-gon with side length &quot;a&quot;, the length of the &quot;xth&quot; shortest distinct diagonal is:

:formula_5

This formula shows that as the number of sides approaches infinity, the &quot;xth&quot; shortest diagonal approaches the length . Additionally, the formula for the shortest diagonal simplifies in the case of x = 1:

:formula_6

If the number of sides is even, the longest diagonal will be equivalent to the diameter of the polygon&#x27;s circumcircle because the long diagonals all intersect each other at the polygon&#x27;s center.

Special cases include:

A square has two diagonals of equal length, which intersect at the center of the square. The ratio of a diagonal to a side is formula_7

A regular pentagon has five diagonals all of the same length. The ratio of a diagonal to a side is the golden ratio, formula_8

A regular hexagon has nine diagonals: the six shorter ones are equal to each other in length; the three longer ones are equal to each other in length and intersect each other at the center of the hexagon. The ratio of a long diagonal to a side is 2, and the ratio of a short diagonal to a side is formula_9.

A regular heptagon has 14 diagonals. The seven shorter ones equal each other, and the seven longer ones equal each other. The reciprocal of the side equals the sum of the reciprocals of a short and a long diagonal.

==Polyhedrons==
A polyhedron (a solid object in three-dimensional space, bounded by two-dimensional faces) may have two different types of diagonals: face diagonals on the various faces, connecting non-adjacent vertices on the same face; and space diagonals, entirely in the interior of the polyhedron (except for the endpoints on the vertices).

==Higher dimensions==
===N-Cube===
The lengths of an n-dimensional hypercube&#x27;s diagonals can be calculated by mathematical induction. The longest diagonal of an n-cube is formula_10. Additionally, there are formula_11 of the &quot;xth&quot; shortest diagonal. As an example, a 5-cube would have the diagonals:

Its total number of diagonals is 416. In general, an n-cube has a total of formula_12 diagonals. This follows from the more general form of formula_13 which describes the total number of face and space diagonals in convex polytopes. Here, v represents the number of vertices and e represents the number of edges.

==Geometry==
By analogy, the subset of the Cartesian product &quot;X&quot;×&quot;X&quot; of any set &quot;X&quot; with itself, consisting of all pairs , is called the diagonal, and is the graph of the equality relation on &quot;X&quot; or equivalently the graph of the identity function from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;X&quot;. This plays an important part in geometry; for example, the fixed points of a mapping &quot;F&quot; from &quot;X&quot; to itself may be obtained by intersecting the graph of &quot;F&quot; with the diagonal.

In geometric studies, the idea of intersecting the diagonal &quot;with itself&quot; is common, not directly, but by perturbing it within an equivalence class. This is related at a deep level with the Euler characteristic and the zeros of vector fields. For example, the circle &quot;S&quot;1 has Betti numbers 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, and therefore Euler characteristic 0. A geometric way of expressing this is to look at the diagonal on the two-torus &quot;S&quot;1×S1 and observe that it can move &quot;off itself&quot; by the small motion (&quot;θ&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;) to (&quot;θ&quot;, &quot;θ&quot; + &quot;ε&quot;). In general, the intersection number of the graph of a function with the diagonal may be computed using homology via the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem; the self-intersection of the diagonal is the special case of the identity function.

<text>Tartan ( ) is a patterned cloth consisting of crossing horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours, forming repeating symmetrical patterns known as &quot;setts&quot;. Originating in woven wool, tartan is most strongly associated with Scotland, where it has been used for centuries in traditional clothing such as the kilt. Historically, specific tartans were linked to Scottish clans, families, or regions, with patterns and colours derived from local dyes. The earliest surviving samples of tartan-style cloth are around 3,000 years old and were discovered in Xinjiang, China. 

Tartan became a symbol of Scottish identity, particularly after the 16th century, despite bans following the Jacobite rising of 1745 under the Dress Act 1746. The 19th-century Highland Revival popularized tartan globally, associating it with Highland dress and the Scottish diaspora. Today, tartan is used worldwide in clothing, accessories, and design, transcending its traditional roots. Modern tartans are registered for organisations, individuals, and commemorative purposes, with thousands of designs in the Scottish Register of Tartans.

While often linked to Scottish heritage, tartans exist in other cultures, such as Africa, East and South Asia, and Eastern Europe. They also serve institutional roles, like military uniforms and corporate branding. Tartan patterns vary in complexity, from simple two-colour designs to intricate motifs with over twenty hues. Colours historically derived from natural dyes, such as lichens and alder bark, are now produced synthetically.

==Etymology and terminology==

The English and Scots word &quot;tartan&quot; is possibly derived from French meaning &#x27;linsey-woolsey cloth&#x27;. Other hypotheses are that it derives from Scottish Gaelic or , meaning &#x27;across&#x27; or &#x27;crossing over&#x27;; or from French or (occurring in 1454 spelled ) meaning &#x27;Tartar cloth&#x27;. It is unrelated to the superficially similar word &quot;tarlatan&quot;, which refers to a very open-weave muslin similar to cheesecloth. &quot;Tartan&quot; is both a mass noun (&quot;12 metres of tartan&quot;) and a count noun (&quot;12 different tartans&quot;).

Today, &quot;tartan&quot; refers to coloured patterns, though originally did not have to be made up of a pattern at all, as it referred to the type of weave; as late as the 1820s, some tartan cloth was described as &quot;plain coloured ... without pattern&quot;. Patterned cloth from the Gaelic-speaking Scottish Highlands was called , meaning &#x27;many colours&#x27;. Over time, the meanings of &quot;tartan&quot; and were combined to describe a certain type of pattern on a certain type of cloth.

The pattern of a particular tartan is called its &quot;sett&quot;. The sett is made up of a series of lines at specific widths which cross at right angles and blend into each other; the longer term &quot;setting&quot; is occasionally used. &quot;Sett&quot; can refer to either the minimal visual presentation of the complete tartan pattern or to a textual representation of it (in a &quot;thread count&quot;).

Today &quot;tartan&quot; is used more generally to describe the pattern, not limited to textiles, appearing on media such as paper, plastics, packaging, and wall coverings.

In North America, the term &quot;plaid&quot; is commonly used to refer to tartan. &quot;Plaid&quot;, derived from the Scottish Gaelic meaning &#x27;blanket&#x27;, was first used of any rectangular garment, sometimes made up of tartan, which could be worn several ways: the belted plaid () or &quot;great kilt&quot; which preceded the modern kilt; the arisaid (), a large shawl that could be wrapped into a dress; and several types of shoulder cape, such as the full plaid and fly plaid. In time, &quot;plaid&quot; was used to describe blankets themselves. In former times, the term &quot;plaiding&quot; or &quot;pladding&quot; was sometimes used to refer to tartan cloth.

==Weaving and design==
===Weaving construction===

The Scottish Register of Tartans provides the following summary definition of tartan:


In more detail, traditional tartan cloth is a tight, staggered 2/2 twill weave of worsted wool: the horizontal &quot;weft&quot; (also &quot;woof&quot; or &quot;fill&quot;) is woven in a simple arrangement of two-over-two-under the fixed, vertical &quot;warp&quot;, advancing one thread at each pass. As each thread in the weft crosses threads in the warp, the staggering by one means that each warp thread will also cross two weft threads. The result, when the material is examined closely, is a characteristic 45-degree diagonal pattern of &quot;ribs&quot; where different colours cross. Where a thread in the weft crosses threads of the same colour in the warp, this produces a solid colour on the tartan, while a weft thread crossing warp threads of a different colour produces an equal admixture of the two colours alternating, producing the appearance of a third colour – a halftone &quot;blend&quot; or &quot;mixture&quot; – when viewed from further back. (The effect is similar to multicolour halftone printing, or cross-hatching in coloured-pencil art.) Thus, a set of two base colours produces three different colours including one blend, increasing quadratically with the number of base colours; so a set of six base colours produces fifteen blends and a total of twenty-one different perceived colours. This means that the more stripes and colours used, the more blurred and subdued the tartan&#x27;s pattern becomes. Unlike in simple &quot;checker (chequer)&quot; or &quot;dicing&quot; patterns (like a chessboard), no solid colour in a tartan appears next to another solid colour, only a blend (solid colours may touch at their corners).

James D. Scarlett (2008) offered a definition of a usual tartan pattern (some types of tartan deviate from the particulars of this definition):
The sequence of thread colours in the &quot;sett&quot; (the minimal design of the tartan, to be duplicated – &quot;the DNA of a tartan&quot;), starts at an edge and either reverses or (rarely) repeats on what are called &quot;pivot points&quot; or &quot;pivots&quot;. In diagram A, the sett begins at the first pivot, reverses at the second pivot, continues, then reverses again at the next pivot, and will carry on in this manner horizontally. In diagram B, the sett proceeds in the same way as in the warp but vertically. The diagrams illustrate the construction of a typical &quot;symmetric&quot; (also &quot;symmetrical&quot;, &quot;reflective&quot;, &quot;reversing&quot;, or &quot;mirroring&quot;) tartan. However, on a rare &quot;asymmetric&quot; (&quot;asymmetrical&quot;, or &quot;non-reversing&quot;) tartan, the sett does not reverse at the pivots, it just repeats at them. An old term for the latter type is &quot;cheek&quot; or &quot;cheeck&quot; pattern. Also, some tartans (very few among traditional Scottish tartans) do not have exactly the same sett for the warp and weft. This means the warp and weft will have differing thread counts . Asymmetric and differing-warp-and-weft patterns are more common in madras cloth and some other weaving traditions than in Scottish tartan.

A tartan is recorded by counting the threads of each colour that appear in the sett. The &quot;thread count&quot; (or &quot;threadcount&quot;, &quot;thread-count&quot;) not only describes the width of the stripes on a sett, but also the colours used (typically abbreviated). Usually every number in a thread count is an even number to assist in manufacture. The first and last threads of the thread count are the pivots. A thread count combined with exact colour information and other weaving details is referred to as a &quot;ticket stamp&quot; or simply &quot;ticket&quot;.
There is no universally standardised way to write a thread count, but the different systems are easy to distinguish. As a simple example:
*The thread count &quot;/K4 R24 K24 Y4/&quot; corresponds to a mirroring pattern of 4 black threads, 24 red threads, 24 black threads, 4 yellow threads, in which the beginning black and ending yellow pivots are repeated (after Y4/, the colours are reversed, first K24 then R24); this is a &quot;&quot;full-count&quot; at the pivots&quot; thread count.
** An equivalent notation is boldfacing the pivot abbreviations: K4 R24 K24 Y4.
* The same tartan could also be represented as &quot;K/2 R24 K24 Y/2&quot;, in markup that indicates that the leading black and trailing yellow duplicated before continuing from these pivot points (after Y/2, the colours are reversed as Y/2 again, then K24, then R24); this is a &quot;&quot;half-count&quot; at the pivots&quot; thread count.
* In the older and potentially ambiguous style of thread-counting, without the &quot;/&quot; (or bold) notation, a thread count like &quot;K4 R24 K24 Y4&quot; is assumed to be full-count at the pivots, unless the author clearly indicates otherwise.
In all of these cases, the result is a &quot;half-sett&quot; thread count, which represents the threading before the pattern mirrors and completes; a full-sett thread count for a mirroring (symmetric) tartan is redundant. A &quot;/&quot; can also be used between two colour codes (e.g. &quot;W/Y24&quot; for &quot;white/yellow 24&quot;) to create even more of a shorthand threadcount for simple tartans in which half of the half-sett pattern is different from the other only in the way of a colour swap; but this is not a common style of thread-counting.
* An asymmetric tartan, one that does not mirror, would be represented in a &quot;full-sett&quot; thread count with &quot;...&quot; markup, as &quot;...K4 R24 K24 Y4...&quot; (after Y4, the entire pattern would begin again from K4).
Various writers and tartan databases do not use a consistent set of colour names and abbreviations, so a thread count may not be universally understandable without a colour key/legend. Some recorders prefer to begin a thread count at the pivot with the colour name (or abbreviation) that is first in alphabetical order (e.g. if there is a white pivot and a blue one, begin with blue), but this is actually arbitrary.

Though thread counts are quite specific, they can be modified depending on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan (e.g., 6 inches square – a typical size for kilts) may be too large to fit upon the face of a necktie. In this case, the thread count would be reduced (e.g. to 3 inches to a side). In some works, a thread count is reduced to the smallest even number of threads (often down to 2) required to accurately reproduce the design; in such a case, it is often necessary to up-scale the thread count proportionally for typical use in kilts and plaids.

Before the 19th century, tartan was often woven with thread for the weft that was up to 1/3 thicker than the fine thread used for the warp, which would result in a rectangular rather than square pattern; the solution was to adjust the weft thread count to return the pattern to square, or make it non-square on purpose, as is still done in a handful of traditional tartans. Uneven warp-and-weft thread thickness could also contribute to a striped rather than checked appearance in some tartan samples.

The predominant colours of a tartan (the widest bands) are called the &quot;under-check&quot; (or &quot;under check&quot;, &quot;undercheck&quot;, &quot;under-cheque&quot;); sometimes the terms &quot;ground&quot;, &quot;background&quot;, or &quot;base&quot; are used instead, especially if there is only one dominant colour. Thin, contrasting lines are referred to as the &quot;over-check&quot; (also &quot;over-stripe&quot; or &quot;overstripe&quot;). Over-checks in pairs are sometimes referred to as &quot;tram lines&quot;, &quot;tramlines&quot;, or &quot;tram tracks&quot;. Bright over-checks are sometimes bordered on either side (usually both), for extra contrast, by additional thin lines, often black, called &quot;guard lines&quot; or &quot;guards&quot;. Historically, the weaver William Wilson &amp; Son of Bannockburn sometimes wove bright over-checks in silk, to give some added shine (commercially around 1820–30, but in regimental officers&#x27; plaids back to at least 1794). Tartan used for plaids (not the belted plaid) often have a purled fringe.
An old-time practice, to the 18th century, was to add an accent on plaids or sometimes kilts in the form of a &quot;selvedge&quot; in herringbone weave at the edge, 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) wide, but still fitting into the colour pattern of the sett; a few modern weavers will still produce some tartan in this style. Sometimes more decorative selvedges were used: &quot;Selvedge marks&quot; were borders (usually on one side only) formed by repeating a colour from the sett in a broad band (often in herringbone), sometimes further bordered by a thin strip of another colour from the sett or decorated in mid-selvedge with two thin strips; these were typically used for the bottoms of belted plaids and kilts, and were usually black in military tartans, but could be more colourful in civilian ones. The more elaborate &quot;selvedge patterns&quot; were a wider series of narrow stripes using some or all of the colours of the sett; these were almost exclusively used on household tartans (blankets, curtains, etc.), and on two opposing sides of the fabric. The very rare &quot;total border&quot; is an all-four-sides selvedge of a completely different sett; described by Peter Eslea MacDonald (2019) as &quot;an extraordinarily difficult feature to weave and can be regarded as the zenith of the tartan weaver&#x27;s art&quot;, it only survives in Scottish-style tartan as a handful of 18th-century samples (in Scotland and Nova Scotia, Canada, but probably all originally from Scotland). The style has also been used in Estonia in the weaving of shawls/plaids.

Tartan is usually woven &quot;balanced-warp&quot; (or just &quot;balanced&quot;), repeating evenly from a pivot point at the centre outwards and with a complete sett finishing at the outer selvedge; e.g. a piece of tartan for a plaid might be 24 setts long and 4 wide. An &quot;offset&quot;, &quot;off-set&quot;, or &quot;unbalanced&quot; weave is one in which the pattern finishes at the edge in the middle of a pivot colour; this was typically done with pieces intended to be joined (e.g. for a belted plaid or a blanket) to make larger spans of cloth with the pattern continuing across the seam; if the tartan had a selvedge mark or selvedge pattern, it was at the other side of the warp.

The term &quot;hard tartan&quot; refers to a version of the cloth woven with very tightly wound, non-fuzzy thread, producing a comparatively rougher and denser (though also thinner) material than is now typical for kilts. It was in common use up until the 1830s. There are extant but uncommon samples of hard tartan from the early 18th century that use the more intricate herringbone instead of twill weave throughout the entire cloth.

While modern tartan is primarily a commercial enterprise on large power looms, tartan was originally the product of rural weavers of the pre-industrial age, and can be produced by a dedicated hobbyist with a strong, stable hand loom. Since around 1808, the traditional size of the warp reed for tartan is , the length of the Scottish ell (previous sizes were sometimes 34 and 40 inches). Telfer Dunbar (1979) describes the setup thus:

&quot;Splits&quot; are also referred to as &quot;dents&quot;, and &quot;Porters&quot; are also called &quot;gangs&quot;.

===Styles and design principles===
Traditional tartan patterns can be divided into several style classes. The most basic is a simple two-colour check of thick bands (with or without thin over-checks of one or more other colours). A variant on this splits one or more of the bands, to form squares of smaller squares instead of just big, solid squares; a style heavily favoured in &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot;. A complexity step up is the superimposed check, in which a third colour is placed centrally &quot;on top of&quot; or &quot;inside&quot; (surrounded by) one of the base under-check colours, providing a pattern of nested squares, which might then also have thin, bright and/or black over-checks added. Another group is multiple checks, typically of two broad bands of colour on a single dominant &quot;background&quot; (e.g. red, blue, red, green, red – again possibly with contrasting narrow over-checks). The aforementioned types can be combined into more complex tartans. In any of these styles, an over-check is sometimes not a new colour but one of the under-check colours &quot;on top of&quot; the other under-check. A rare style, traditionally used for arisaid () tartans but no longer in much if any Scottish use, is a pattern consisting entirely of thin over-checks, sometimes grouped, &quot;on&quot; a single ground colour, usually white. M. Martin (1703) reported that the line colours were typically blue, black, and red. Examples of this style do not survive, at least not in the tartan databases (there may be preserved museum pieces with such patterns). Some tartan patterns are more abstract and do not fit into any of these styles, especially in madras cloth .

There are no codified rules or principles of tartan design, but a few writers have offered some considered opinions. Banks &amp; de La Chapelle (2007) summarized, with a view to broad, general tartan use, including for fashion: &quot;Color – and how it is worked – is pivotal to tartan design... Thus, tartans should be composed of clear, bright colors, but ones sufficiently soft to blend well and thereby create new shades.&quot; James D. Scarlett (2008) noted: &quot;the more colours to begin with, the more subdued the final effect&quot;, or put more precisely, &quot;the more stripes to the sett and the more colours used, the more diffuse and &#x27;blurred&#x27; the pattern&quot;. That does not necessarily translate into subtlety; a tartan of many colours and stripes can seem &quot;busy&quot;.

Scarlett (2008), after extensive research into historical Highland patterns (which were dominated by rich red and medium green in about equal weight with dark blue as a blending accent – not accounting for common black lines), suggested that for a balanced and style:

Scarlett (1990) provided a more general explanation, traditional styles aside:
Further, Scarlett (1990) held that &quot;background checks will show a firm but not harsh contrast and the overchecks will be such as to show clearly&quot; on the under-check (or &quot;background&quot;) colours. He summed up the desired total result as &quot;a harmonious blend of colour and pattern worthy to be looked upon as an art form in its own right&quot;.

Omitting traditional black lines has a strong softening effect, as in the 1970s Missoni fashion ensemble and in many madras patterns . A Scottish black-less design (now the Mar dress tartan) dates to the 18th century; another is Ruthven (1842, ), and many of the Ross tartans (e.g. 1886, ), as well as several of the Victorian–Edwardian MacDougal[l] designs, are further examples. Various modern tartans also use this effect, e.g. Canadian Maple Leaf (1964, ). Clever use of black or another dark colour can produce a visual perception of depth.

===Colour, palettes, and meaning===
There is no set of exact colour standards for tartan hues; thread colour varies from weaver to weaver even for &quot;the same&quot; colour. A certain range of general colours, however, are traditional in Scottish tartan. These include blue (dark), crimson (rose or dark red), green (medium-dark), black, grey (medium-dark), purple, red (scarlet or bright), tan/brown, white (actually natural undyed wool, called in Gaelic), and yellow. Some additional colours that have been used more rarely are azure (light or sky blue), maroon, and vert (bright or grass green), plus light grey (as seen in Balmoral tartan, though it is sometimes given as lavender). Since the opening of the tartan databases to registration of newly designed tartans, including many for organisational and fashion purposes, a wider range of colours have been involved, such as orange and pink, which were not often used (as distinct colours rather than as renditions of red) in old traditional tartans. The Scottish Register of Tartans uses a long list of colours keyed to hexadecimal &quot;Web colours&quot;, sorting groups of hues into a constrained set of basic codes (but expanded upon the above traditional list, with additional options like dark orange, dark yellow, light purple, etc.). This helps designers fit their creative tartan into a coding scheme while allowing weavers to produce an approximation of that design from readily stocked yarn supplies.

In the mid-19th century, the natural dyes that had been traditionally used in the Highlands (like various lichens, alder bark, bilberry, cochineal, heather, indigo, woad, and yellow bedstraw) began to be replaced by artificial dyes, which were easier to use and were more economic for the booming tartan industry, though also less subtle. Although William Morris in the late-19th-century Arts and Crafts movement tried to revive use of British natural dyes, most were so low-yield and so inconsistent from locality to locality (part of the reason for the historical tartan differentiation by area) that they proved to have little mass-production potential, despite some purple dye (cudbear) commercialisation efforts in Glasgow in the 18th century. The hard-wound, fine wool used in tartan weaving was rather resistant to natural dyes, and some dye baths required days or even weeks. The dyeing also required mordants to fix the colours permanently, usually metallic salts like alum; there are records from 1491 of alum being imported to Leith, though not necessarily all for tartan production in particular. Some colours of dye were usually imported, especially red cochineal and to some extent blue indigo (both expensive and used to deepen native dyes), from the Low Countries, with which Scotland had extensive trade since the 15th century. Aged human urine (called or ) was also used, as a colour-deepener, a dye solubility agent, a lichen fermenter, and a final colour-fastness treatment. All commercially manufactured tartan today is coloured using artificial not natural dyes, even in the less saturated colour palettes.

The hues of colours in any established tartan can be altered to produce variations of the same tartan. Such varying of the hues to taste dates to at least the 1788 pattern book of manufacturer William Wilson &amp; Son of Bannockburn. Today, the semi-standardised colour schemes or &quot;palettes&quot; (what marketers might call &quot;&quot;) are divided generally into &quot;modern&quot;, &quot;ancient&quot;, &quot;muted&quot;, and &quot;weathered&quot; (sometimes with other names, depending on weaver). These terms only refer to relative dye &quot;colourfulness&quot; saturation levels and do not represent distinct tartans.

; Modern
: Also known as &quot;ordinary&quot;; refers to darker tartan, with fully saturated colours. In a &quot;modern&quot; palette, setts made up of blue, black, and green tend to be obscured because of the darkness of the colours in this scheme.
; Ancient
: Also known as &quot;old colours&quot; (OC); refers to a lighter palette of tartan. These hues are ostensibly meant to represent the colours that would result from natural-dyed fabric aging over time. However, the results are not accurate (e.g., in real examples of very old tartan, black often fades toward khaki or green while blue remains dark; and natural dyes are capable of producing some very vibrant colours in the first place, though not very consistently). This style originated in the first half of the 20th century. This &quot;ancient&quot; is not to be confused with the same word in a few names of tartans such as &quot;ancient Campbell&quot;.
; Weathered
: Also called &quot;faded&quot;; refers to tartan that is even lighter (less saturated) than &quot;ancient&quot;, as if exposed for a very long time. This style was invented in the late 1940s.
; Muted
: Refers to tartan which is between &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;ancient&quot; in vibrancy. Although this type of colouring is very recent, dating only from the early 1970s, these hues are thought to be the closest match to the colours attained by natural dyes used before the mid-19th century.

Some particular tartan mills have introduced other colour schemes that are unique to that weaver and only available in certain tartans. Two examples are Lochcarron&#x27;s &quot;antique&quot;, between &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;ancient&quot;; and D. C. Dalgliesh&#x27;s &quot;reproduction&quot;, a slight variation on &quot;weathered&quot;, dating to the 1940s and claimed to be based on 18th-century samples.

A general observation about &quot;ancient/old&quot;, &quot;weathered/faded&quot;, and &quot;muted&quot; are that they rather uniformly reduce the saturation of all colours, while actual natural-dyed tartan samples show that the historical practice was usually to pair one or more saturated colours with one or more pale ones, for greater clarity and depth, a &quot;harmonious balance&quot;. According to Scarlett (1990): &quot;The colours were clear, bright and soft, altogether unlike the eye-searing brilliance or washed-out dullness of modern tartans&quot;.

The same tartan in the same palette from two manufacturers (e.g. Colquhoun muted from D. C. Dalgliesh and from Strathmore) will not precisely match; there is considerable artistic license involved in exactly how saturated to make a hue.

Tartan-generation software can approximate the appearance of a tartan in any of these palettes. The examples below are all the &quot;Prince Charles Edward Stuart&quot; tartan:
Scottish tartans that use two or more hues of the same basic colour are fairly rare. The best known is the British royal family&#x27;s Balmoral (1853, two greys, both as under-check). Others include: Akins (1850, two reds, one as over-check and sometimes rendered purple), MacBean (1872, two reds, one as over-check and sometimes rendered purple), Childers Universal regimental (1907, two greens, both under-check), Gordon red (recorded 1930–1950 but probably considerably older; two blues and two reds, one of each used more or less as over-checks), Galloway district hunting/green (1939/1950s, two greens, both under-check), US Air Force Reserve Pipe Band (1988, two blues, both under-check), McCandlish (1992, three variants, all under-check), Isle of Skye district (1992, three greens, all arguably under-check, nested within each other), and Chisholm Colonial (2008, two blues, one an over-check, the other nearly blended into green). The practice is more common in very recent commercial tartans that have no association with Scottish families or districts, such as the Loverboy fashion label tartan (2018, three blues, one an over-check).

The idea that the various colours used in tartan have a specific meaning is purely a modern one, notwithstanding a legend that red tartans were &quot;battle tartans&quot;, designed so they would not show blood. It is only recently created tartans, such as Canadian provincial and territorial tartans (beginning 1950s) and US state tartans (beginning 1980s), that are stated to be designed with certain symbolic meaning for the colours used. For example, green sometimes represents prairies or forests, blue can represent lakes and rivers, and yellow might stand for various crops. In the &quot;Scottish Register of Tartans&quot; (and the databases before it), colour inspiration notes are often recorded by a tartan&#x27;s designer. However, there is no common set of tartan colour or pattern &quot;motifs&quot; with allusive meanings that is shared among designers.

More abstractly, from an art criticism perspective, design historian Richard Martin (1988) wrote of tartans as designs and tartan as a textile class having no truly endemic or objectified meanings, but being an art that &quot;has the property of being a vessel or container of meaning, a design form that exists not only in history but through history&quot;, capable of conveying radically different, even contradictory, contextual meanings &quot;ever changing and evolving&quot; through socio-cultural transmutation of the fabric&#x27;s use. Thus tartan could veer from symbol of anti-union and Jacobite Highland rebellion to emblem of pan-British loyalty to empire in the space of two generations, or serve different fashion markets in the same recent decades as both a sartorial status symbol of traditional values and a punk and grunge rebel banner.

==Early history==
===Pre-medieval origins===
Today, tartan is mostly associated with Scotland; however, the oldest tartan-patterned twill cloth ever discovered dates to a heterogenous culture of the Tarim Basin, c. 2100 BC through the first centuries AD in what today is Xinjiang, China, southeast of Kazakhstan. The tartan fabric (along with other types of simple and patterned cloth) was recovered, in excavations beginning in 1978, with other grave goods of the Tarim or Ürümqi mummies – a group of often Caucasoid (light-haired, round-eyed) bodies naturally preserved by the arid desert rather than intentionally mummified. The most publicised of them is the Chärchän Man, buried around 1,000 BC with tartan-like leggings in the Taklamakan Desert. Other twill tartan samples (with differing warp and weft) were recovered in the region from the site of Qizilchoqa in 1979, dating to around 1,200 BC; the material was woven with up to six colours and required a sophisticated loom (of a type that seems to have originated in the West). Victor H. Mair, an archaeologist and linguist involved in the excavations wrote: &quot;The ancient inhabitants ... undoubtedly had vibrant interactions with peoples of West Central Asia and even further west, since their magnificent textiles possess motifs, dyes, and weaves that are characteristic of cultures that lie in that direction.&quot;

Textile analysis of that fabric has shown it to be similar to that of ancient Europe. According to textile historian Elizabeth J. Wayland Barber, the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age people of Central Europe, the Hallstatt culture, which is linked with ancient Celtic populations and flourished between the 8th and 6th centuries BC, produced tartan-like textiles. Some of them were discovered in 2004, remarkably preserved, in the Hallstatt salt mines near Salzburg, Austria; they feature a mix of natural-coloured and dyed wool. Some date back to 1,200 BC, and Wayland Barber says of them that: &quot;The overall similarities between Hallstatt plaid twills and recent Scottish ones, right down to the typical weight of the cloth, strongly indicate continuity of tradition. The chief difference is that the Hallstatt plaids contain no more than two colors&quot;. Similar finds have been made elsewhere in Central Europe and Scandinavia.

Classical Roman writers made various references to the continental Gauls, south of Britain, wearing striped or variegated clothing; Latin seems to have lacked an exact word for &#x27;checked&#x27;. For example, Virgil in the Aeneid (29–19 BC, book VIII, line 660) described the Gauls as (or ) meaning something like &#x27;they shine in striped cloaks&#x27; or &#x27;their cloaks are striped brightly&#x27;. Other writers used words such as and with translations like &#x27;marled&#x27;, &#x27;variegated&#x27;, &#x27;particoloured&#x27;, etc. Scarlett (1990) warns: &quot;What is not reasonable is the ready assumption by many modern authors that every time one of these words, or something like it, was used, tartan was intended.&quot; It might have been intended sometimes, or the writer might have just meant linear stripes like seersucker cloth. Both Scarlett and Thompson (1992) decry the unsustainable assumption by a few earlier modern writers (e.g. James Grant, 1886) that Gauls must have been running around in clan tartans. The Romans particularly wrote of Gauls as wearing striped (trousers). E. G. Cody in remarks in his 1885 edition of John Lesley&#x27;s &quot;Historie of Scotland&quot; hypothesized that this was actually a Gaulish loanword and was cognate with Gaelic . This is one of many &quot;tartan legends&quot; that is not well accepted; rather, is considered by modern linguists a cognate of English &quot;breeches&quot;, Gaelic (&#x27;trousers&#x27;), etc.

The earliest documented tartan-like cloth in Britain, known as the &quot;Falkirk tartan&quot;, dates from the 3rd century AD. It was uncovered at Falkirk in Stirlingshire, Scotland, near the Antonine Wall. The fragment, held in the National Museum of Scotland, was stuffed into the mouth of an earthenware pot containing almost 2,000 Roman coins. The Falkirk tartan has a simple &quot;Border check&quot; design, of undyed light and dark wool. Other evidence from this period is the surviving fragment of a statue of Roman Emperor Caracalla, once part of the triumphal arch of Volubilis completed in 217 AD. It depicts a Caledonian Pictish prisoner wearing tartan trews (represented by carving a checked design then inlaying it with bronze and silver alloys to give a variegated appearance). Based on such evidence, tartan researcher James D. Scarlett (1990) believes Scottish tartan to be &quot;of Pictish or earlier origin&quot;, though Brown (2012) notes there is no way to prove or disprove this.

Early forms of tartan like this are thought to have been invented in pre-Roman times, and would have been popular among the inhabitants of the northern Roman provinces as well as in other parts of Northern Europe such as Jutland, where the same pattern was prevalent, and Bronze Age Sweden.

That twill weave was selected, even in ancient times, is probably no accident; &quot;plain (2/2) twill for a given gauge of yarn, yields a cloth 50% heavier [denser] – and hence more weather-proof – than the simple 1/1 weave.&quot; According to Scarlett (2008):
===Medieval===

There is little written or pictorial evidence about tartan (much less surviving tartan cloth) from the Medieval era. Tartan use in Britain between the 3rd-century Falkirk tartan and 16th-century samples, writings, and art is unclear. Cosmo Innes (1860) wrote that, according to medieval hagiographies, Scots of the 7th–8th centuries &quot;used cloaks of variegated colour, apparently of home manufacture&quot;. Based on similarities of tartans used by various clans, including the Murrays, Sutherlands, and Gordons, and the history of their family interactions over the centuries, Thomas Innes of Learney estimated that a regional &quot;parent&quot; pattern, of a more general style, might date to the 12th or 13th century, but this is quite speculative. The cartularies of Aberdeen in the 13th century barred clergymen from wearing &quot;striped&quot; clothing, which could have referred to tartan.

In 1333, Italian Gothic artists Simone Martini and Lippo Memmi produced the &quot;Annunciation with St. Margaret and St. Ansanus&quot;, a wood-panel painting in tempera and gold leaf. It features the archangel Gabriel in a tartan-patterned mantle, with light highlights where the darker stripes meet, perhaps representing jewels, embroidery, or supplementary weaving. Art historians consider it an example of &quot;Tartar&quot; (Mongol) textile influence; it likely has no relation to Scottish tartan. &quot;Tartar&quot; cloth came in a great array of patterns, many more complex than tartan (such as the fine detail in Gabriel&#x27;s robe in the same painting); patterns of this sort were influential especially on Italian art in the 14th century.

There are several other continental European paintings of tartan-like garments from around this era (even back to the 13th century), but most of them show very simple two-colour basic check patterns, or (like the Martini and Memmi &quot;Annunciation&quot; example) broad squares made by thin lines of one colour on a background of another. Any of them could represent embroidery or patchwork rather than woven tartan. There seems to be no indication in surviving records of tartan material being imported from Scotland in this period. In the second half of the 14th century, the artist known only as the &quot;Master of Estamariu&quot; (in Catalonia, Spain) painted an altarpiece of St Vincent, one of the details of which is a man in a cotehardie that is red on one half and a complex three-colour tartan on the other, which is very similar to later-attested Scottish tartans.

Sir Francis James Grant, mid-20th-century Lord Lyon King of Arms, noted that records showed the wearing of tartan in Scotland to date as far back as 1440. However, it is unclear to which records he was referring, and other, later researchers have not matched this early date.

===16th century===

The oldest surviving sample of complex, dyed-wool tartan (not just a simple check pattern) in Scotland has been shown through radiocarbon dating to be from the 16th century; known as the &quot;Glen Affric tartan&quot;, it was discovered in the early 1980s in a peat bog near Glen Affric in the Scottish Highlands; its faded colours include green, brown, red, and yellow. On loan from the Scottish Tartans Authority, the artefact went on display at the V&amp;A Dundee museum in April 2023.

The earliest certain written reference to tartan by name is in the 1532–33 accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland: &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Another tartan coat given to the king by the Master Forbes&#x27;), followed not long after by a 1538 record of clothing made by Thomas Arthur for King James V of Scotland, which includes &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Highland tartan to be hose&#x27;). Plaids were featured a bit earlier; poet William Dunbar (c. 1459 – c. 1530) mentions &quot;&quot;. The earliest surviving image of a Highlander in what was probably meant to represent tartan is a 1567–80 watercolour by Lucas de Heere, showing a man in a belted, pleated yellow tunic with a thin-lined checked pattern, a light-red cloak, and tight blue shorts (of a type also seen in period Irish art), with claymore and dirk. It looks much like medieval illustrations of &quot;Tartar&quot; cloth and thus cannot be certain to represent true tartan. By the late 16th century, there are numerous references to striped or checked plaids. Supposedly, the earliest pattern that is still produced today (though not in continual use) is the Lennox district tartan, (also adopted as the clan tartan of Lennox) said to have been reproduced by D. W. Stewart in 1893 from a portrait of Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox, dating to around 1575. However, this seems to be legend, as no modern tartan researchers or art historians have identified such a portrait, and the earliest known realistic one of a woman in tartan dates much later, to c. 1700. Extant portraits of Margaret show her in velvet and brocade.

Tartan and Highland dress in the Elizabethan era have been said to have become essentially classless – worn in the Highlands by everyone from high-born lairds to common crofters, at least by the late 16th century. The historian John Major wrote in 1521 that it was the upper class, including warriors, who wore plaids while the common among them wore linen, suggesting that woollen cloth was something of a luxury. But by 1578, Bishop John Lesley of Ross wrote that the belted plaid was the general Highland costume of both rich and poor, with the nobility simply able to afford larger plaids with more colours. (Later, Burt (1726) also wrote of gentlemen having larger plaids than commoners.) If colours conveyed distinction, it was of social class not clan. D. W. Stewart (1893) attributed the change, away from linen, to broader manufacture of woollen cloth and &quot;the increased prosperity of the people&quot;.

Many writers of the period drew parallels between Irish and Highland dress, especially the wearing of a long yellow-dyed shirt called the or saffron shirt (though probably not actually dyed with expensive imported saffron), worn with a mantle (cloak) over it, and sometimes with trews. It is not entirely certain when these mantles were first made of tartan in the Highlands, but the distinctive cloth seems to get its recorded mentions first in the 16th century, starting with Major (1521). In 1556, Jean de Beaugué, a French witness of Scottish troops on the continent at the 1548 Siege of Haddington, distinguished Lowlanders from Highland &quot;savages&quot;, and wrote of the latter as wearing shirts &quot;and a certain light covering made of wool of various colours&quot;. George Buchanan in 1582 wrote that &quot;plaids of many colours&quot; had a long tradition but that the Highland fashion by his era had mostly shifted to a plainer look, especially brown tones, as a practical matter of camouflage. Fynes Moryson wrote in 1598 (published 1617) of common Highland women wearing &quot;, &quot;.

Its dense weave requiring specialised skills and equipment, tartan was not generally one individual&#x27;s work but something of an early cottage industry in the Highlands – an often communal activity called , including some associated folk singing traditions – with several related occupational specialties (wool comber, dyer, waulker, warp-winder, weaver) among people in a village, part-time or full-time, especially women. The spinning wheel was a late technological arrival in the Highlands, and tartan in this era was woven from fine (but fairly inconsistent) hard-spun yarn that was spun by hand on drop spindles. The era&#x27;s commerce in tartans was centred on Inverness, the early business records of which are filled with many references to tartan goods. Tartan patterns were loosely associated with the weavers of particular areas, owing in part to differences in availability of natural dyes, and it was common for Highlanders to wear whatever was available to them, often a number of different tartans at the same time. The early tartans found in east-coastal Scotland used red more often, probably because of easier continental-European trade in the red dye cochineal, while western tartans were more often in blues and greens, owing to the locally available dyes. The greater expense of red dye may have also made it a status symbol. Tartan spread at least somewhat out of the Highlands, but was not universally well received. The General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland in 1575 prohibited the ministers and readers of the church (and their wives) from wearing tartan plaids and other &quot;sumptuous&quot; clothing, while the council of Aberdeen, &quot;a district by no means Highland&quot;, in 1576 banned the wearing of plaids (probably meaning belted plaids).

A 1594 Irish account by Lughaidh Ó Cléirigh of Scottish gallowglass mercenaries in Ireland clearly describes the belted plaid, &quot;a mottled garment with numerous colours hanging in folds to the calf of the leg, with a girdle round the loins over the garment&quot;. The privately organised early &quot;plantations&quot; (colonies) and later governmental Plantation of Ulster brought tartan weaving to Northern Ireland in the late 16th to early 17th centuries. Many of the new settlers were Scots, and they joined the population already well-established there by centuries of gallowglass and other immigrants. In 1956, the earliest surviving piece of Irish tartan cloth was discovered in peaty loam just outside Dungiven in Northern Ireland, in the form of tartan trews, along with other non-tartan clothing items. It was dubbed the &quot;Dungiven tartan&quot; or &quot;Ulster tartan&quot;. The sample was dated using palynology to c. 1590–1650 (the soil that surrounded the cloth was saturated with pollen from Scots pine, a species imported to Ulster from Scotland by plantationers). According to archaeological textile expert Audrey Henshall, the cloth was probably woven in County Donegal, Ireland, but the trews tailored in the Scottish Highlands at some expense, suggesting someone of rank, possibly a gallowglass. Henshall reproduced the tartan for a 1958 exhibit; it became popular (and heavily promoted) as a district tartan for Ulster (both in a faded form, like it was found, and a bright palette that attempted to reproduce what it may have originally looked like), and seems to have inspired the later creation of more Irish district tartans. . There is nearly nothing in period source material to suggest that the Irish also habitually wore tartan; one of the only sources that can possibly be interpreted in support of the idea is William Camden, who wrote in his &quot;Britannia&quot; (since at least the 1607 edition) that &quot;Highlandmen ... wear after the Irish fashion striped mantles&quot;.

===17th century===

The earliest unambiguous surviving image of Highlanders in an approximation of tartan is a watercolour, dating to c. 1603–1616 and rediscovered in the late 20th century, by Hieronymus Tielsch or Tielssch. It shows a man&#x27;s belted plaid, and a woman&#x27;s plaid (arisaid, ) worn as a shawl or cloak over a dress, and also depicts diced short hose and a blue bonnet. Clans had for a long time independently raised militias, and starting in 1603, the British government itself mustered irregular militia units in the Highlands, known as the Independent Highland Companies (IHCs). Being Highlanders, they were probably wearing tartan (1631 Highland mercenaries certainly were, and the ICHs were in tartan in 1709 and actual uniforms of tartan by 1725). Tartan was used as a furnishing fabric, including bed hangings at Ardstinchar Castle in 1605. After mention of Highlanders&#x27; &quot;striped mantles&quot; in Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; of 1607, poet John Taylor wrote in 1618 in &quot;The Pennyless Pilgrimage&quot; of &quot;tartane&quot; Highland garb in detail (in terms that generally match what was described and illustrated even two centuries later); he noted that it was worn not just by locals but also by visiting British gentlemen. The council of Aberdeen again cracked down on plaids in 1621, this time against their use as women&#x27;s head-wear, and the kirk in Glasgow had previously, in 1604, forbidden their wear during services; similar kirk session rulings appeared in Elgin in 1624, in Kinghorn in 1642 and 1644, and Monifieth in 1643, with women&#x27;s plaids more literarily censured in Edinburgh in 1633 by William Lithgow. In 1622, the Baron Courts of Breadalbane set fixed prices for different complexities of tartan and plain cloth.

In 1627, a tartan-dressed body of Highland archers served under the Earl of Morton. More independent companies were raised in 1667. The earliest image of Scottish soldiers in tartan is a 1631 copperplate engraving by Georg Köler (1600–1638); it features Highland mercenaries of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in the forces of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Not long after, James Gordon, Parson of Rothiemay, wrote in &quot;A History of Scots Affairs from 1637 to 1641&quot; of the belted plaid as &quot;&quot; He also described the short hose and trews (&quot;trowzes&quot;). A 1653 map,  by Joan Blaeu, features a cartouche that depicts men in trews and belted plaid; the tartan is crudely represented as just thin lines on a plain background, and various existing copies are hand-coloured differently. Daniel Defoe, in &quot;Memoirs of a Cavalier&quot; (c. 1720) wrote, using materials that probably dated to the English Civil War, of Highlanders invading Northern England back in 1639 that they had worn &quot;doublet, breeches and stockings, of a stuff they called plaid, striped across red and yellow, with short cloaks of the same&quot;.

Besides the formerly often-chastised wearing of head-plaids in church, women&#x27;s dress was not often described (except in earlier times as being similar to men&#x27;s). The Highland and island women&#x27;s equivalent of the belted plaid was the arisaid (), a plaid that could be worn as a large shawl or be wrapped into a dress. Sir William Brereton had written in 1634–35 (published 1844) of Lowland women in Edinburgh that: &quot;Many wear (especially of the meaner sort) plaids ... which cast over their heads and covers their faces on both sides, and would reach almost to the ground, but that they pluck them up, and wear them cast under their arms.&quot; He also reported that women there wore &quot;six or seven several habits and fashions, some for distinction of widows, wives and maids&quot;, including gowns, capes/cloaks, bonnets with veils, and collar ruffs, though he did not address tartan patterns in particular in such garments.

While tartan was still made in the Highlands as cottage industry, by 1655 production had centred on Aberdeen, made there &quot;in greater plenty than [in] any other place of the nation whatsoever&quot;, though it was also manufactured in Glasgow, Montrose, and Dundee, much of it for export. In Glasgow at least, some of the trade was in tartan manufactured in the Highlands and the Hebrides and brought there for sale along with hides and other goods. Impressed by the trade in Glasgow, Richard Franck in his &quot;Northern Memoirs&quot; of 1658 wrote that the cloth was &quot;the staple of this country&quot;. In 1662, the naturalist John Ray wrote of the &quot;party coloured blanket which [Scots] call a plad, over their heads and shoulders&quot;, and commented that a Scotsman even of the lower class was &quot;clad like a gentleman&quot; because the habit in this time was to spend extraordinarily on clothing, a habit that seems to have gone back to the late 16th century. A Thomas Kirk of Yorkshire commented on trews, plaids, and possibly kilts of &quot;plaid colour&quot; in 1677; more material by Kirk was printed in the 1891 &quot;Early Travellers in Scotland&quot; edited by Peter Hume Brown, recording &quot;plad wear&quot; in the form of belted plaids, trews, and hose. A poem by William Cleland in 1678 had Scottish officers in trews and shoulder plaids, and soldiers in belted plaids. In 1689, Thomas Morer, an English clergyman to Scottish regiments, described Lowland women as frequently wearing plaids despite otherwise dressing mostly like the English.
The earliest known realistic portrait in tartan Highland dress is a piece (which exists in three versions) by John Michael Wright, showing a very complicated tartan of brown, black, and two hues of red; it is dated to c. 1683 and is of Mungo Murray, son of John Murray, Marquess of Atholl.

In 1688, William Sacheverell, lieutenant governor of the Isle of Man, wrote of the tartan plaids of the women of Mull in the Inner Hebrides as &quot;much finer, the colours more lively, and the squares larger than the men&#x27;s ... This serves them for a veil, and covers both head and body.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart/Dunbar Sacheverell&quot;&gt;Stewart, D. W. (1893), p. 24. Also quoted in: Telfer Dunbar (1979), pp. 44, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1691 poem &quot;The Grameid&quot;, James Philip of Almerieclose described the 1689 Battle of Killiecrankie in terms that seem to suggest that some clan militias had uniform tartan liveries, and some historians have interpreted it thus.

===18th century===
It is not until the early 18th century that regional uniformity in tartan, sufficient to identify the area of origin, is reported to have occurred. Martin Martin, in &quot;A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland&quot;, published in 1703, wrote, after describing trews and belted plaids &quot;&quot;, that tartans could be used to distinguish the inhabitants of different places. Martin did not mention anything like the use of a special pattern by each family.

In 1709, the Independent Highland Companies were wearing everyday Highland dress, not uniforms of a particular tartan, to better blend in with civilians and detect Jacobite treachery. In 1713, the Royal Company of Archers (a royal bodyguard unit first formed in 1676), became the first unit in service to the British crown who adopted a particular tartan as a part of their formal uniform. The militiamen of Clan Grant may have been all in green-and-red tartan (details unspecified) as early as 1703–04 and wearing a uniform tartan livery by 1715. It is not a surviving pattern, and modern Grant tartans are of much later date. 

An account of the Highland men in 1711 had it that they all, including &quot;those of the better sort&quot;, wore the belted plaid. A 1723 account suggested that gentlemen, at least when commingling with the English, were more likely to wear tartan trews and hose with their attendants in the belted plaid, which Burt also observed; trews were also more practical for horseback riding. Also around 1723, short tartan jackets, called in Gaelic , sometimes with slashed sleeves and worn with a matching waistcoat, made their first appearance and began supplanting, in Highland dress, the plain-coloured doublets that were common throughout European dress of the era; the was often worn with matching trews and a shoulder plaid that might or might not match, but could also be worn with a belted plaid.
M. Martin (1703) wrote that the &quot;vulgar&quot; Hebridean women still wore the arisaid wrap/dress, describing it as &quot;a white Plad, having a few small Stripes of black, blue, and red; it reach&#x27;d from the Neck to the Heels, and was tied before on the Breast with a Buckle of Silver, or Brass&quot;, some very ornate. He said they also wore a decorated belt, scarlet sleeves, and head kerchiefs of linen. Martin was not the only period source to suggest it was primarily the wear of the common women, with upper-class Highland ladies in the 18th century more likely to weartailored gowns, dresses, and riding habits, often of imported material, as did Lowland and English women. Highland women&#x27;s dress was also sometimes simply in linear stripes rather than tartan, a cloth called (drugget). From the late 18th century, as the arisaid was increasingly set aside for contemporary womenswear, while Highland men continued wearing the belted plaid., the ladies&#x27; plaids were reduced to smaller &quot;screens&quot; – fringed shawls used as headdresses and as dress accessories, &quot;a gentrification of the arisaid&quot;. (Wilsons continued producing these in the first half of the 19th century.) John Macky in &quot;A Journey Through Scotland&quot; (1723) wrote of Scottish women wearing, when about, such tartan plaids over their heads and bodies, over English-style dress, and likened the practice to continental women wearing black wraps for church, market, and other functions. Edmund Burt, an Englishman who spent years in and around Inverness, wrote in 1727–1737 (published 1754) that the women there also wore such plaids, made of fine worsted wool or even of silk, that they were sometimes used to cover the head, and that they were worn long, to the ankle, on one side. He added that in Edinburgh (far to the southeast) they were also worn, with ladies indicating their Whig or Tory political stance by which side they wore long (though he did not remember which side was which). In Edinburgh, perennial disapproval of the &quot;&quot; of women wearing plaids over their heads returned in 1753 writings of William Maitland. Women first appear in known painted portraits with tartan c. 1700, with that of Rachel Gordon of Abergeldie; more early examples are found in 1742 and 1749 paintings by William Mosman. They show plaids (in tartans that do not survive as modern patterns) worn loosely around the shoulders by sitters in typical European-fashion dresses. Some entire dresses of tartan feature in mid-18th-century portraits, but they are uncommon. In the Jacobite period, tartan was sometimes also used as trim, e.g. on hats. Plaids were worn also as part of wedding outfits. The monied sometimes had entire wedding dresses of tartan, some in silk, and even devised custom tartans for weddings, typically based on existing patterns with colours changed.
Portraits became more popular among the Highland elite starting in the early 18th century. Similar cloth to that in the c. 1683 Mungo Murray portrait appears in the 1708 portrait of the young John Campbell of Glenorchy, attributed to Charles Jervas; and the c. 1712 portrait of Kenneth Sutherland, Lord Duffus, by Richard Waitt. This style of very &quot;busy&quot; but brown-dominated tartan seems to have been fairly common through the early 18th century, and is quite different from later patterns. As the century wore on, bolder setts came to dominate, judging from later portraits and surviving cloth and clothing samples. By the early 18th century, tartan manufacture (and weaving in general) were centred in Bannockburn, Stirling; this is where the eventually dominant tartan weaver William Wilson and Son, founded c. 1765, were based.

Judging from rare surviving samples, the predominant civilian tartan colours of this period, in addition to white (undyed wool) and black, were rich reds and greens and rather dark blues, not consistent from area to area; where a good black was available, dark blue was less used. The sett of a typical Highland pattern of the era as shown in portraits was red with broad bands of green and/or blue, sometimes with fine-line over-checks. Oil portraiture was the province of the privileged, and &quot;Sunday best&quot; tartans with red grounds were commonly worn in them as a status symbol, from the early 18th century, the dye typically being made from expensive imported cochineal. Green and blue more generally predominated owing to their relative ease of production with locally available dyes, with more difficult yellow and red dyes commonly being saved for thin over-check lines (a practice that continued, e.g. in military and consequently many clan tartans, through to the 19th century). However, even local-dyestuff blues were often over-dyed with some amount of imported indigo for a richer colour.

====Union protest and Jacobite rebellion====
The Treaty and Acts of Union in 1706–07, which did away with the separate Parliament of Scotland, led to Scottish Lowlanders adopting tartan in large numbers for the first time, as a symbol of protest against the union. It was worn not just by men (regardless of social class), but even influential Edinburgh ladies, well into the 1790s. By the beginning of the 18th century, there was also some demand for tartan in England, to be used for curtains, bedding, nightgowns, etc., and weavers in Norwich, Norfolk, and some other English cities were attempting to duplicate Scottish product, but were considered the lower-quality option.
The most effective fighters for Jacobitism were the supporting Scottish clans, leading to an association of tartan and Highland dress with the Jacobite cause to restore the Catholic Stuart dynasty to the throne of England, Scotland, and Ireland. This included great kilts, and trews (trousers) with great coats, all typically of tartan cloth, as well as the blue bonnet. The British parliament had considered banning the belted plaid after the Jacobite rising of 1715, but did not. Highland garb came to form something of a Jacobite uniform, even worn by Prince Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;) himself by the mid-18th century, mostly in propaganda portraits (with inconsistent tartans) but also by eyewitness account at Culloden. By this period, sometimes a belted plaid was worn over tartan trews and jacket (in patterns that need not match).
Burt had concurred c. 1728, as did his 1818 editor Robert Jamieson, with Buchanan&#x27;s much earlier 1582 observation that tartans were often in colours intended to blend into heather and other natural surroundings. This may just represent prejudices of English writers of the period, however, at least by the mid-18th century. Extant samples of Culloden-era cloth are sometimes quite colourful. One example is a pattern found on a coat (probably Jacobite) known to date to around the 1745 uprising; while it has faded to olive and navy tones, the sett is a bold one of green, blue, black, red, yellow, white, and light blue (in diminishing proportions). While an approximation of the pattern was first published in D. W. Stewart (1893), the colours and proportions were wrong; the original coat was rediscovered and re-examined in 2007. Another surviving Culloden sample, predominantly red with broad bands of blue, green, and black, and some thin over-check lines, consists of a largely intact entire plaid that belonged on one John Moir; it was donated to the National Museum of Scotland in 2019.

There is a legend that a particular still-extant tartan was used by the Jacobites as an identifier even prior to &quot;the &#x27;15&quot;. This story can be traced to W. &amp; A. Smith (1850) in &quot;Authenticated Tartans of the Clans and Families of Scotland&quot;, in which they claimed that a pattern they published was received from an unnamed woman then still living who in turn claimed a family tradition that the tartan dated to 1712, long before her birth, but for which there is no evidence. This hearsay tale was later repeated as if known fact by other books, e.g., Adam Frank&#x27;s &quot;What Is My Tartan?&quot; in 1896, and Margaret MacDougall&#x27;s 1974 revision of Robert Bain&#x27;s 1938 &quot;Clans and Tartans of Scotland&quot;. Even the often credulous Innes of Learney (1938) did not believe it. The pattern in question does date to at least c. 1815–26, because it was collected by the Highland Society of London during that span. But there is no substantiated evidence of Jacobites using a consistent tartan, much less one surviving to the present.

Independent Highland Companies were re-raised from Scottish clans loyal to the Hanoverian monarchy during 1725–29. This time they wore uniform tartans of blue, black, and green, presumably with differencing over-check lines. They were all normalised to one tartan during 1725–33 (a pattern which probably does not survive to the present day). The uniform tartan appears to have changed into a new tartan, known today as Black Watch or Government, when the companies amalgamated to become the 42nd (Black Watch) regiment in 1739. 

====Proscription and its aftermath====
After the failure of the Jacobite rising of 1745, efforts to pacify the Highlands and weaken the cultural and political power of the clans led to the Dress Act 1746, part of the Act of Proscription to disarm the Highlanders. Because tartan Highland dress was so strongly symbolically linked to the militant Jacobite cause, the act – a highly political throwback to the long-abandoned sumptuary laws – banned the wearing of Highland dress by men and boys in Scotland north of the River Forth (i.e. in the Highlands), except for the landed gentry and the Highland regiments of the British Army. The law was based on 16th century bans against the wearing of traditional Irish clothing in the Kingdom of Ireland by the Dublin Castle administration. Sir Walter Scott wrote of the Dress Act: &quot;There was knowledge of mankind in the prohibition, since it divested the Highlanders of a dress which was closely in association with their habits of Clanship and of war.&quot;

Tartans recorded shortly after the act (thus probably being patterns in use in the period before proscription) show that a general pattern was used in a wide area, with minor changes being made by individual weavers to taste. E.g., the tartan today used as the main (red) Mackintosh clan tartan, recorded by the Highland Society of London around 1815, was found in variants from Perthshire and Badenoch along the Great Glen to Loch Moy. Other such groups can be found, e.g. a Huntly-centred Murray/Sutherland/Gordon cluster analysed as clearly related by Innes of Learney (1938) – distinguished from a different Huntly/MacRae/Ross/Grant group identified by Scottish Register of Tartans and tartan researcher Peter Eslea MacDonald of Scottish Tartans Authority. But Scarlett (1990) says that &quot;the old patterns available are too few in number to permit a detailed study of such pattern distributions&quot; throughout the Highlands. Portraits of the era also show that tartan was increasingly made with identical or near-identical warp and weft patterns, which had not always been the case earlier, and that the tartan cloth used was of the fine twill, with even-warp-and-weft thickness, still used today for kilts.

Although the Dress Act, contrary to popular later belief, did not ban all tartan (or bagpipes, or Gaelic), and women, noblemen, and soldiers continued to wear tartan, it nevertheless effectively severed the everyday tradition of Highlanders wearing primarily tartan, as it imposed the wearing of non-Highland clothing common in the rest of Europe for two generations. (While some Highlanders defied the act, there were stiff criminal penalties.) It had a demoralising effect, and the goal of this and related measures to integrate the Highlanders into Lowland and broader British society was largely successful. By the 1770s, Highland dress seemed all but extinct. However, the act may also ironically have helped to &quot;galvanize clan consciousness&quot; under that suppression; Scottish clans, in romanticised form, were to come roaring back in the &quot;clan tartans&quot; run of the Regency (late Georgian) to Victorian period.
In the interim, Jacobite women continued using tartan profusely, for clothing (from dresses to shoes), curtains, and everyday items. While Classicism-infused portraiture of 18th-century clan nobles (often painted outside Scotland) typically showed them in tartan and &quot;Highland&quot; dress, much of it was loyalist regimental military stylings, the antithesis of Jacobite messaging; it foreshadowed a major shift in the politics of tartan . Nevertheless, this profuse application of tartan could be seen as rebellious to some extent, with the Highlander becoming &quot;a heroic and classical figure, the of primitive virtues.&quot; And by the 1760s, tartan had become increasingly associated with Scotland in general, not just the Highlands, especially in the English mind.
After much outcry (as the ban applied to Jacobites and loyalists alike), the Dress Act was repealed in 1782, primarily through efforts of the Highland Society of London; the repeal bill was introduced by James Graham, Marquis of Graham (later Duke of Montrose). Some Highlanders resumed their traditional dress, but overall it had been abandoned by its former peasant wearers, taken up instead by the upper and middle classes, as a fashion. Tartan had been &quot;culturally relocated as a picturesque ensemble or as the clothing of a hardy and effective fighting force&quot; for the crown, not a symbol of direct rebellion. R. Martin (1988) calls this transmutation &quot;the great in tartan dress&quot;, the cloth being largely (forcibly) abandoned by the original Highland provincials then taken up by the military and consequently by non-Highlander civilians. During the prohibition, traditional Highland techniques of wool spinning and dyeing, and the weaving of tartan, had sharply declined. Commercial production of tartan was to become re-centred in the Lowlands, in factory villages along the fringe of the Highlands, among companies like Wilsons of Bannockburn (then the dominant manufacturer), with the rise of demand for tartan for military regimental dress. Some tartan weaving continued in the Highlands, and would even see a boost in the late Georgian period. Tartan by this era had also become popular in Lowland areas including Fife and Lothian and the urban centres of Edinburgh and Stirling. From 1797 to 1830, Wilsons were exporting large quantities of tartan (for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s clothing), first to the British colonies in Grenada and Jamaica (where the affordable, durable, and bright material was popular for clothing enslaved people), and had clients in England, Northern and Central Europe, and a bit later in North and South America and the Mediterranean. However, by the end of the 18th century, Wilsons had &quot;stiff competition&quot; (in civilian tartan) from English weavers in Norwich.

Because the Dress Act had not applied to the military or gentry, tartan gradually had become associated with the affluent, rather than &quot;noble savage&quot; Highlanders, from the late 18th century and into the 19th, along with patriotic military-influenced clothing styles in general; tartan and militarised Highland dress were being revived among the fashion-conscious across Britain, even among women with military relatives. The clans, Jacobitism, and anti-unionism (none of them any longer an actual threat of civil unrest) were increasingly viewed with a sense of nostalgia, especially after the death of Prince Charles Edward Stuart in 1788, even as Highland regiments proved their loyalty and worth. Adopting the airs of a Tory sort of tartaned &quot;Highlandism&quot; provided a post-union and resigned sense of national (and militarily elite) distinction from the rest of Britain, without threatening empire. Even the future George IV donned Highland regalia for a masquerade ball in 1789. By the 1790s, some of the gentry were helping design tartans for their own personal use, according to surviving records from Wilsons. Jane (Maxwell) Gordon, Duchess of Gordon, was said to have &quot;introduced tartan to [royal] court ... wearing a plaid of the Black Watch, to which her son had just been appointed&quot;, in 1792; she triggered a fashion of wearing tartan in London and Paris, though was not immune to caricature by the disapproving.

R. Martin (1988) wrote, from a historiographical perspective, that after the Dress Act:

The tumultuous events of 18th-century Scotland led to not just broader public use of tartan cloth, but two particular enduring tartan categories: regimental tartans and eventually clan tartans.

==Regimental tartans==

After the period of the early clan militias and the Independent Highland Companies (IHCs), over 100 battalions of line, fencible, militia, and volunteer regiments were raised, between c. 1739 and the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, in or predominantly in the Highlands, a substantial proportion of them in Highland dress. Of these units, only some had distinct uniform tartans, and of those, only a small number were recorded to the present day.
The IHCs were amalgamated in 1739 to become the 43rd (later 42nd) Regiment of Foot, called the Black Watch. It was the first proper governmental Highland regiment, part of the British Army, and they wore the belted plaid (&quot;great kilt&quot;) for dress, and the tailored small kilt for undress uniform. For the former garment, they used a distinctive tartan, which was designed for the unit. It was originally called the &quot;42nd tartan&quot;, so it probably was not adopted until after the unit was renumbered the 42nd in 1749. It seems likely that the tartan was based on those used by the IHCs earlier, but with double black &quot;tram line&quot; over-checks added. The Black Watch pattern was used by various other regiments, and it has been estimated that to clothe them all, some of the tartan had to be woven before 1750 alone. It became the basis of various later regimental (and eventually clan) tartans. It remains popular in general-public use under the names &quot;Black Watch&quot;, &quot;Government&quot;, and any of &quot;old Campbell&quot;, &quot;hunting Grant&quot;, or &quot;hunting Munro&quot;, but today officially called &quot;Government No. 1&quot; by the military. The 42nd had separate tratans for its small kilt until c. 1814 (also used for grenadiers&#x27; belted plaids), for pipers, and for drummers.

After the Jacobite uprisings, raising a regiment in service to the king was, for many Scottish lairds, a way of rehabilitating the family name, assuring new-found loyalty to the Hanoverian crown, and currying royal favour (even regaining forfeited estates). Exempt from the Dress Act, men in these Highland regiments of the empire were given Highland dress, and the &quot;kilts and pipes that were once considered barbaric were now seen as ‘safe’ nationalism&quot; within the army. From c. 1770 onward into the 19th century, virtually all the regimental tartan was produced by the company William Wilson &amp; Son of Bannockburn, the dominant tartan weaver. Regimental uniforms, including tartans, were left – usually within the general Black Watch-based colour scheme of black, blue, and green – to their commanders.

Some surviving early regimental tartans include:
* Loudoun&#x27;s Highlanders (64th, raised in 1745), used a tartan similar to Black Watch, but with over-checks of red and yellow, and lacking the two black &quot;tram lines&quot; of Black Watch.
* The 78th (Highlanders) or Ross-shire Buffs (raised 1793), MacLeod&#x27;s Highlanders (73rd, later 71st, raised 1777–78), and the original Seaforth Highland Regiment (78th, later 72nd, raised 1778) first used Black Watch, then in 1787 adopted a variant of it with thin over-checks of red and white. It eventually became the Clan Mackenzie tartan, and it remains used as an official British military tartan, designated &quot;Government No. 5A&quot;. A slight variation, with yellow in place of white, became one of the Clan MacLeod tartans.
* The 74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot (raised 1787) used another variant of the Black Watch tartan with a black-guarded white over-check. Also in 1787, the 75th (Highland) Regiment, later 75th (Stirlingshire), probably used a more distinct tartan, not based on Black Watch, of purple and black on a green ground, with thin white and black over-checks; it was later called &quot;No. 64 or Abercromby&quot; by Wilsons, and though it did not become adopted as an Abercromby/Abercrombie clan tartan, variants of it became two unrelated clan patterns.
* The Gordon Highlanders (100th, later 92nd, raised 1794) also wore an altered Black Watch, this time with a thin yellow over-check. In a rare show of competition to Wilsons, the pattern was designed in 1793 and supplied by weaver William Forsyth of Huntly, Aberdeen. This pattern became the main tartan of Clan Gordon. Something nearly identical (perhaps with the yellow over-check in a different width) was also used by the 8th (Rothesay and Caithness) Fencibles.
* The Cameronian Volunteers (79th, later Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders, raised 1793) used a comparatively distinct tartan, later the family tartan of the Cameron of Erracht branch of Clan Cameron. It is structurally much like Black Watch, but without black over-checks and with a number of yellow and red over-checks. It has been said to have been designed by the unit leaderor a family member.
* The Fraser Fencibles (raised 1794–95) used a tartan with a red ground and green and blue bands, unrelated to the Black Watch style.
* The Sutherland Highlanders (93rd) raised 1799, and later the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise&#x27;s, formed 1881 by amalgamation of the 93rd with the 91st Argyllshire Highlanders), may have worn a lightened version of Black Watch, now sometimes used as one of the Clan Sutherland tartans; it is also still militarily used as sett &quot;Government No. 1A&quot;.
* The Loyal Clan Donnachie Volunteers (raised in 1803) had its own uniform tartan, which was later adopted as the hunting Robertson/Donnachie/Duncan clan tartan.
* The Duke of Albany&#x27;s Own Highlanders (formerly Seaforth&#x27;s 72nd), during a trews-wearing period of 1823–1881, wore a tartan called Prince Charles Edward Stuart, similar to royal Stewart, as shown in a period painting. Identified in surviving cloth samples from the mid-18th century (before the regiment) it is one of the oldest setts in continuous production. 

By the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, women in Scotland were especially &quot;desirous to dress in the uniform plaids of their husbands&quot;, in particularly fine-quality cloth, according to records of Wilsons of Bannockburn. After the Highland regiments proved themselves fearless and effective in various military campaigns, the glory associated with them did much to keep alive, initially among the gentry and later the general public, an interest in tartan and kilts, which might have otherwise slipped into obscurity due to the Dress Act&#x27;s prohibition. The belted plaid was abandoned in favour of the small kilt, around 1814. After the &quot;clan tartanry&quot; rush of the early to mid-19th century , various later Highland regiments adopted some of the recently minted clan tartans for their uniforms (reversing the original regimental-into-clan-tartan flow). Some of these adoptions remain in regimental use today.

The Lowland regiments (dating in some form to 1633 and never before dressed in Highland garb but in a variant of regular army uniform) were outfitted in tartan trews in 1881. This both linked them with and distinguished them from the tartan-kilted Highland regiments. Typically the &quot;Government&quot; (Black Watch) tartan was used, though some units later diversified. Several Highland regiments were again assigned new tartans that were clan tartans rather than unit-specific ones, into the early 20th century.

Today, about a dozen tartans are officially used (and half a dozen more unofficially) between all of the surviving historical Scottish regiments, which have largely been amalgamated since 2006 as battalions into the Royal Regiment of Scotland, part of the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division. These tartans are only worn in dress and pipe-band uniforms, after the practical uniform changes introduced in the early part of World War II, which did away with tartan kilts and trews in undress uniforms. Some military units in other countries also have their own tartans. In all, there are at least 38 documented tartans that have at one time or another been associated with regiments, though many of them also with clans.

==Clan tartans==
With an exception dating to 1618 and another to c. 1703–1715 (neither of which appear to have survived), it is generally regarded that tartans associated by name with Scottish clans mostly date to the early-to-mid 19th century, some few to the late 18th at the earliest, depending on how one defines &quot;clan tartan&quot;. The belief that the clan tartans are an &quot;ancient&quot; system of symbolic family differentiation is pervasive, even passionate, but lacks substantive evidence even as it is overwhelmed by counter-evidence. It is what J. C. Thompson (1992) called &quot;the Great Tartan Myth&quot;, and James D. Scarlett (1990) &quot;the Tartan Cult&quot;. Lt.-Col. M. M. Haldane (1931) called it an assumption, which &quot;has acquired such a formidable weight from mere reiteration&quot; without &quot;critical examination of evidence&quot;. Barnes &amp; Allen (1956) observed:

Responding to the claim that clan tartans have &quot;an ancient political significance&quot;, Richard Martin, curator of the Fashion Institute of Technology museum and later the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, wrote (1988): &quot;[This] assertion about history is wrong and can be demonstrated to be wrong&quot;. According to National Galleries of Scotland curator A. E. Haswell Miller (1956):
Highland-dress researcher and curator John Telfer Dunbar added:
Just that sort of research was performed by Peter Eslea MacDonald of the Scottish Tartans Authority, who – using every available surviving company record and sample – reconstructed and traced the history of tartan patterns from the leading weaver of the late Georgian through Edwardian eras, a company instrumental in the actual design, spread, and acceptance of clan tartans. His conclusion:
The notion of clan tartans has been called &quot;an astonishingly successful marketing story&quot; and an example of an invented tradition, though one that became very well-accepted by the clans to whom it pertained and by the weaving industry starting in 1815, as well as by the general public from around 1822 – &quot;adopted enthusiastically by both wearer and seller alike&quot;.

Precursors of clan tartans were regionally distinctive tartans (since at least the early 18th century, perhaps even the 16th), regimental uniform tartans (from 1725 onward), and personal tartans of nobles (dating to perhaps the mid-18th century if not earlier).

Today, clan tartans are an important aspect of Scottish clans, and every clan has at least one tartan attributed to its name (some officially, some not, and in a few cases one tartan is shared between multiple clans). Clan tartans may not have actually been traditional, but they became conventional.

===Long-running debate===

Various writers on tartans have supported or opposed the idea of clans long using distinctive tartans as an identifying badge, interpreting the scarce evidence as suited their viewpoint. Where one saw a militia uniform, or an individual noble&#x27;s plaid, another saw a clan identifier. The 19th-century Celtic scholar John Francis Campbell of Islay was certain that while tartans in general were quite old, &quot;uniform clan tartans are no older than clan regiments&quot;, a view backed by Haldane (1931) in a series of articles in &quot;The Scots Magazine&quot;, followed by many tartan writers later.

The earliest evidence summarised below could have been more a matter of militia uniform than clan-wide dress; a distinction in that era is difficult to be certain of today, because troops then were led by landed gentry and a unit was raised largely on its commander&#x27;s land from his clansmen. Such definitional uncertainty could also apply to the 1691 &quot;Grameid&quot; poem; describing what appear to be some soldierly uniform tartans, it could be reinterpreted as supporting an early notion of clan tartans, if one wanted to define that as &#x27;what most of the men of a clan were wearing into battle&#x27;; Scarlett (1990) confirms that there has been &quot;fiery argument&quot; in favour of a clan tartans interpretation. However, Robert Jamieson (1818) reported that the &quot;field dress&quot; plaids of Highland men, for war and hunting, were different from their everyday dress – made of coarser material and using patterns intended to blend into natural surroundings, the or (&#x27;war colour&#x27;). This casts some doubt on interpretation of militia tartans as general clan tartans. Most of the later regimental uniform tartans (which did not become adopted as clan tartans until around the early 19th century or the late 18th in a few cases, when they did at all) were variations on the dark, green-based Black Watch tartan, as detailed above.

J. C. Thompson (1992) noted &quot;a typical Victorian inclination to cite previous authors with little or no attempt to evaluate their statements ... Modern analysis cannot afford to be so uncritical.&quot; Scarlett (1990) relatedly observed:
Even D. W. Stewart (1893), who had sometimes been sympathetic toward the idea of clan tartans existing before the 19th century, wrote:
The Victorians also engaged in some imaginative invention. Aside from the outright forgery of the &quot;Sobieski Stuarts&quot; , another extreme case is Charles Rogers, who in his &quot;Social Life in Scotland&quot; (1884–86) fantastically claimed that the ancient Picts&#x27; figural designs – which were painted or tattooed on their bodies, and they went into battle nude – must have been &quot;denoting the families or septs to which they belonged&quot; and thus &quot;This practice originated the tartan of Celtic clans.&quot; Another asserted that tartan was invented around a thousand years ago by Saint Margaret of Scotland.

Aside from the unreliability of early writers (and later copiers of them), part of the confusion and debate about clan tartans comes down to definitions. Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, writing in 1938 and described as &quot;immensely keen on [tartan] codification and the importance of it&quot;, was one of the firmest proponents of the idea of very old clan tartans (in the particular sense of &#x27;patterns consistently used for a period by certain clans&#x27;, not &#x27;patterns named for certain clans and claimed by them to the present&#x27;). He held that some setts gradually became associated with particular families (clans and septs thereof) over time; clan territories had mostly become stable by the 16th century. D. W. Stewart&#x27;s 1893 reference shows various cases of old district tartans later sometimes being identified for a time with specific families before 19th-century adoption of their own (usually different) clan tartans. Innes of Learney wrote of clan tartans that (notwithstanding the unusual 1618 case covered below) &quot;the tendency was rather to insist upon a similarity of general hue than on similarity of detail&quot;, a vague sense that is not what &quot;clan tartan&quot; usually refers to. He also reasoned that &quot;it was not until about the 18th century that the clan tartans became and badges of identification&quot;. However, the surviving period source material lacks this &quot;acknowledgement&quot; and does not actually suggest broad adoption of formal clan tartans (with clan names, particularity of detail, and a symbolic, identifying intent) until the early 19th century.

===Earliest evidence===
The &quot;Sobieski Stuarts&quot; (1842) and later D. W. Stewart (1893) made much of some changes to the feu duty paid in woven cloth by locals of Noraboll on the island of Islay to their lords. In 1587, under the Macleans, the cloth was to be white, black, and green; in 1617, under the Mackenzies, the demanded cloth-rent changed to white, black, and grey. These writers were sure, without any further evidence, that this represented a change of clan tartans.

The only clear instance of a clan-based and specific livery tartan to an early date, rather than simply regional and later regimental uniformity, is found in a 1618 letter from Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun (in the employ of the Earl of Sutherland) to Murray of Pulrossie, chieftain of the Murray branch in Sutherland but subordinate to the Earl of Sutherland, chief of Clan Sutherland (in turn recently become subordinate to the Gordon earls). The letter (rediscovered in 1909) requested Pulrossie &quot;to remove the red and white lines from the plaides of his men so as to bring their dress into harmony with that of the other septs&quot; of Sutherland. The letter does not specify the tartan to which to conform; there have been sharply conflicting interpretations, and it is not even certain that it was a tartan that survived to the present.
A case of general colour-matching: In 1703–04, the chief of Clan Grant ordered that his &quot;&quot; men obtain clothing in red and green tartan (vaguely described as &quot;broad springed&quot; but not specified in detail). The material seems not to have been provided by Grant for them in a centralised way, but left to each man to furnish by his own means (on penalty of a fine). &quot;He did not order them to wear the &#x27;Clan Grant Tartan&#x27;, as one would expect if such a tartan existed at that time.&quot; Some of the modern Grant tartans also use red and green; one was designed by Wilsons of Bannockburn in 1819 as &quot;New Bruce&quot; and shortly adopted by both Grant of Redcastle and Clan Drummond; one was reconstructed from an 1838 portrait; another first appeared in the dubious &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot; of 1842 ; and so on – none with pre-19th-century history. Nevertheless, D. W. Stewart (1893) proclaimed on this thin material that here was &quot;a complete chain of evidence ... of the existence of a uniform clan pattern at the very start of the eighteenth century&quot; – despite his own observation that portraits of leading members of the Grant family in this era do not show them wearing consistent tartans, much less ones that agree with modern &quot;official&quot; Grant tartans. Scarlett (1990), though thinking this presaged &quot;the Clan Tartan Idea&quot;, notes that &quot;had the men of Strathspey been accustomed to wearing uniform tartans it would not have been necessary to order them to do so&quot; (twice over). He also observes that the lairds of Grant in this period were unusually bent on uniformity, one of them even issuing moustache regulations for clansmen; the Grant red-and-green order cannot be taken as typical of everyday Highland practice. Telfer Dunbar (1979) notes that Highland military discipline hardly existed: &quot;To these independent Highland chieftains restraint of any kind was irksome and unbearable, and to impose any rigid military discipline on their followers ... [was] found to be impossible.&quot; Nevertheless, Mackay (1924) corroborates Grant militia wearing a livery tartan in 1715.

In 1718, Allan Ramsay (the writer, father of the artist by the same name) published the poem &quot;Tartana&quot;, which combined colours with Latinised family names: &quot;... If shining red Campbella&#x27;s cheeks adorn ... If lin&#x27;d with green Stuarta&#x27;s Plaid we view ... Or thine Ramseia, edg&#x27;d around with blue ...&quot; This has sometimes been taken as evidence of early clan tartans, despite possibly just referring to the edging and lining of garments (coloured facings were common on jackets of the time). Worse for this hypothesis, the Campbell tartans are predominantly green, Stuart/Stewart red, and Ramsay red and green. The extant red Campbell tartans are all modern reconstructions of patterns (that are unlike each other) from portraits; Stewart/Stuart tartans with significant green date to the early 19th century or much later; and the Ramsay blue hunting sett dates to 1950.

A Victorian volume, &quot;Old and New Edinburgh&quot; (1884) by James Grant, stated that one Rev. Joseph Robertson MacGregor &quot;attired himself in a full suit of the MacGregor tartan&quot; in 1782, upon repeal of the Dress Act. But it misquoted the original source (and contained other errors). The original, &quot;A Series of Original Portraits and Caricature Etchings&quot; (1842) by John Kay, read: &quot;dressed himself in the Highland costume peculiar to his clan&quot;, and says nothing of tartan, much less a suit of clan tartan. While 1782 is within the late-18th-century range accepted by some researchers for some informal early clan tartans, this is not clear evidence of one.

===Lack of further evidence of early adoption===
John Lesley, bishop of Ross, in 1578 wrote a great deal about Highland customs, including dress, but did not include clan tartans (despite later being claimed to have been the original keeper of the &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot; clan-tartans manuscript, now known to be a 19th-century forgery).
In 1688, William Sacheverell, a Manx politician, described Hebrideans of the Isle of Mull all wearing plaids, but the women in a different style of colour and pattern – not a consistent &quot;clan&quot; tartan. Rev. Thomas Morer in 1689 described Highland garb in some detail, including tartan plaids and hose (made from the same cloth), but mentions no clan patterns. Daniel Defoe (c. 1720) wrote also in considerable detail of Highland warriors of the prior century, and noted that the men were organised into &quot;companies, all of a name&quot;, each led by &quot;one of their own clan or family&quot;, yet he never mentions any distinction between tartans of these different groups, instead describing them all as wearing tartan with red and yellow over-checks, strongly implying a regional style. This pattern of 17th- through 18th-century writings providing specifics of tartan and Highland dress, but nothing about clan tartans, is consistent.

Contemporary portraits show that although tartan is of an early date, the pattern worn depended not on the wearer&#x27;s clan, but rather regional style and personal taste. They frequently depict subjects wearing multiple tartans at once. Nor do the tartans shown match current clan tartans. For example, the famous painting &quot;The MacDonald Boys Playing Golf&quot; (1740s), attributed usually to William Mosman but sometimes to Jeremiah Davison, shows them wearing five different tartans, and they are not surviving patterns (except as later reconstructions from the painting). Period tartans were also often of differing warp and weft (giving more of a striped than checked appearance), unlike modern symmetrical patterns. Sometimes the portraits were copied, but with tartans that do not match, as if the designs were up to artistic whim. As Scarlett (1990) put it:

D. W. Stewart (1893) had also noted this, about both portrait tartans and &quot;examples of tartan fabrics which can be proved to date from the risings of 1715 and 1745&quot;. Many of the portraits by Allan Ramsay the younger show the same shoulder plaid but with colours changed, suggesting it was the artist&#x27;s own studio prop and used for modelling purposes by his clients who apparently did not care about the tartan pattern. According to Scottish National Portrait Gallery keeper A. E. Haswell Miller (1956):


According to Trevor-Roper (1983):

David Morier&#x27;s well-known mid-18th-century painting of the Highland charge at the 1745 Battle of Culloden shows eight Highlanders wearing over twenty different tartans which have been analysed in detail; very few of the setts painted resemble today&#x27;s clan tartans, though they are similar to existing samples of tartan cloth from the era. The method of identifying Highlander friend from foe was not through tartans but by the colour of the bonnet&#x27;s cockade or ribbon, or perhaps by the different plant sprigs worn in the cockade of the bonnet. In particular, the government Highland militia forces wore a badge in the form of a black cockade with red saltire; according to Mackay Scobie (1946), &quot;each individual wore his own Highland dress with varied tartans, with the only uniform part being the &#x27;Hanoverian&#x27; cockade and large coloured cross on the bonnet.&quot; A 1745 letter on the Jacobite troops at Culloden describes &quot;&quot;; i.e., only the bodyguards were wearing a uniform, and it was not of Highland dress.

One of many tartan legends has it that the Highland-dress ban of the Dress Act was enacted because tartans were used as clan-identifying symbols or uniforms, but not a trace of this idea can be found in period sources. To the contrary, Burt (1727–37) was explicit that English objection to Highland dress (since perhaps 1703–04) was , because the garb served to distinguish the Highlanders as a people apart from the Lowlanders and other British (not distinguish Highlander from Highlander). Defoe (c. 1720) likewise mocked Highland dress as what he saw as a clownish costume that set Highlanders apart from everyone else, not each other. Similarly, in an account of Jacobite trials, it was asked whether defendants had worn &quot;Highland &quot; in general, with no mention of clan-identifying patterns. Extant MacDonald tartan fragments from the Battle of Culloden do not match each other or any current clan tartan named MacDonald. Lord President Duncan Forbes of Culloden, keen on punishing the Jacobites with disarmament and other penalties, wrote a detailed letter laying out and points (mostly ) regarding the proposed Highland-dress ban before Parliament passed it, yet never indicated anything like clan tartans, something that would have been a key argument to address.

C. C. P. Lawson (1967) raised a point of logic: &quot;Remembering the continuous clan feuds and the consequent state of more or less perpetual hostilities, a recognisable clan plaid would have been a positive danger to the wearer outside his own territory.&quot; This may explain why the handful of early apparent examples of groups of men in similar tartan seem to have the nature of militia uniforms and are mentioned in the context of &quot;&quot; bodies or outright battle (possibly aside from the 1618 case). Lawson also states: &quot;The &#x27;45 supplies no evidence that tartans were used as clan insignia ... Relics of those tartans which were worn at Culloden or of the pre-1745 period bear no resemblance to any known modern tartan.&quot; The Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1948, Sir Francis James Grant, wrote that pre-1745 tartans were qualitatively different from those of the 19th century and later. Scottish United Services Museum curator Dunbar (1979) notes this as well.

The Jacobite poets wrote much about the rousing appeal of Highland clans and Highland dress, even tartan specifically, but never mentioned clan tartans. Similarly, multiple large volumes of traditional Highland folklore were collected and published by John Francis Campbell in 1860–62 (revised 1890–93), and Alexander Carmichael (who also collected tartan samples) in 1900, but the period materials in them are devoid of any recorded references to clan tartans (despite post-dating the popularisation of the notion among city-dwellers and the upper class).

The idea of groups of men wearing the exact same tartan as an identifier is thought to originate (aside, again, from the odd 1618 case) from Highland regiment units in the 18th century, starting with the Black Watch in 1739/1749. According to Trevor-Roper (1983):


Particular regiments were often dominated by men raised from the same clan lands, and this may have blurred the line between regimental uniform and clan-identifying tartan. (And several tartans of extinct regiments survive today as clan tartans.) Newsome (2006) writes: &quot;the practice of clans wearing these regimental tartans may have in fact been the inspiration for the &#x27;clan tartan&#x27; system as we now know it.&quot; Telfer Dunbar (1979), on the idea of the early Independent Highland Companies using distinct uniform tartans: &quot;I feel sure that here we have much of the &#x27;clan tartan&#x27; origin.&quot; The end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries brought an unprecedented level of influence of military clothing styles, including Highland regimental, on civilian attire (even for women), especially among the social elite connected to regiments. Some regimental tartans appear to have been named after their commanding officers, and this may be how they came to be associated with family/clan names over time. Banks &amp; de La Chapelle (2007):

Scarlett (1990) also observed the connection to regional or &quot;district&quot; tartans:

Haswell Miller (1956) similarly noted: &quot;We can ... readily accept that certain dyes would prevail in different regions and that traditional types of pattern might be followed in various parts.&quot; Martin Martin in 1703 had described tartans as being identifiably specific to particular regions, but not clans. There are numerous cases of tartans loosely associated with districts later becoming clan tartans. The best-documented case is the Tullibardine pattern, one of the few modern clan tartans that can be traced (at all, not as a clan tartan) to the pre-proscription period. It was long associated with Perthshire, and later adopted as the Murray of Tullibardine clan tartan, but sold by Wilsons as simply &quot;Tullibardine&quot; as late as c. 1830–40, and it was found for sale in a market by W. &amp; A. Smith around 1850, who also said it was worn then by Charles Murray, Earl of Dunmore; the first record of the pattern as &quot;Murray of Tullibardine&quot; is in their 1850 book. It appears in at least five early portraits; four date to c. 1740–1750, the first of an unknown female sitter attributed to Cosmo Alexander, and three by Allan Ramsay (with the cloth painting completed by Joseph van Aken) which are not of any known Murrays (but of a Campbell, a MacLeod, and a MacDonald). It is not until 1770 that a known Murray is painted wearing it (John Murray, Earl of Dunmore, by Joshua Reynolds), which still does not necessarily make it a &quot;clan tartan&quot; at that early a date (&quot;evidence for its historic use by that branch [of Clan Murray] is circumstantial at best&quot;). The oldest version of it differs slightly as to colours and sett from the modern clan version.

Similarly, according to the Scottish Register of Tartans, the district tartan for Huntly, originating in more complex form as the personal tartan of a Marchioness of Huntly (probably Henrietta Mordaunt), was in use as a regional tartan since at least &quot;the &#x27;45&quot;, and worn at Culloden by clansmen of Brodie, Forbes, Gordon, MacRae, Munro, and Ross, &quot;which gives a strong indication of the greater antiquity of the &#x27;District&#x27; setts compared to the Clan tartans.&quot;

Some surviving early records of tartan manufacture are those of the Orphan Hospital Manufactory and Paul&#x27;s Work, in Edinburgh, for the period 1734–37 and 1751–52; tartans were not named but given numeric designations such as &quot;No. 2nd&quot;. In 1745, the &quot;Caledonian Mercury&quot; of Edinburgh carried an advertisement for a &quot;Great Choice of Tartans, the newest Patterns&quot; – not clan or even district tartans, but newly devised ones, suggesting a fashion market driven by novelty not supposed &quot;heraldic&quot; traditions. Even clan-tartans booster D. W. Stewart (1893) conceded: &quot;This advertisement, it may be urged, is a stumbling-block in the way of those who argue for the antiquity of clan patterns; for it seems peculiar that, when the city was filled with Highlanders of all ranks and many clans, they should be offered not their ancient setts ...&quot; Other advertisements for tartan from 1745 to the early 19th century did not mention clans, or focus on the patterns at all, but rather on the forms in which the cloth could be ordered. Even immediately after the repeal of the Dress Act in 1782, the demand was for &quot;latest patterns and bright colours&quot;, with no hint of a family heraldry aspect.

William Wilson &amp; Son of Bannockburn, just south of the dividing line between the Highlands and Lowlands, were the first large-scale commercial tartan producers; founded c. 1765, they had become the foremost supplier of tartan to the military by around 1770, and the dominant tartan weaver in general. It was an endeavor that required the introduction of tartan recording, of standardisation of setts and dyes, and of consistency and quality control. Wilsons corresponded with their agents (especially the son, James Wilson) in the Highlands to get information and samples of cloth from the various districts to enable them to reproduce &quot;perfectly genuine patterns&quot;. Wilsons recorded over 200 setts in addition to ones they designed in-house, collected in their 1819 &quot;Key Pattern Book&quot; of around 250 setts (among earlier in-house volumes to the 1770s). These tartans were numbered, named after places, or given fanciful names such as &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, later sometimes family names (after prominent members), sometimes foreign names like &quot;Coburg&quot;, but usually not those of clans, nor, when they did, often matching present clan patterns. A large proportion of the modern clan tartans, however, be traced to this work – just often originally with numbers or unrelated names. The evidence of direct adoption from Wilsons happening frequently completely overwhelms &quot;ancient clan tartans&quot; sentiment.

The &quot;Scottish National Dictionary&quot;, in providing an unusually discursive definition of &quot;tartan&quot;, includes: &quot;[T]owards the end of the 18th century and largely through the enterprise of Messrs Wilson, weavers in Bannockburn, a series of tartans, each ascribed to a certain clan, was devised and is now accepted as authoritative, though almost entirely unhistorical.&quot; Analysing the direct and strong influence of Wilsons&#x27; &quot;Key Pattern Book&quot; (&quot;KPB&quot;) on the later adoption of clan tartans , Eslea MacDonald (2012) concluded:
The Cockburn Collection of 56 tartan samples (some of them duplicates) was put together between 1810 and c. 1825 (most likely 1816–25) by Lt.-Gen. Sir William Cockburn, and is now in the Mitchell Library in Glasgow. This collection does ascribe particular family names to many of these setts (probably naming them after prominent individuals), but only sometimes corresponding to current clan tartan associations (indeed, some patterns that are today associated with particular clans were given multiple different names in the Cockburn Collection). There are many conflicts in name-to-pattern associations between this collection and that of the Highland Society of London around the same time.

Even David Stewart of Garth, who was to become one of the chief proponents of the idea of clan tartans, observed in 1814 only that various heads of families seemed to have selected personal tartans and that there were also district tartans. When Garth and his Highland Society of London solicited clan tartans from chiefs in 1815 , Col. Alexander Robertson of Struan, Chief of Clan Robertson/Donnachaidh/Duncan, wrote back:

At the beginning of the 19th century, a letter from an Inverness tailor to Wilsons of Bannockburn requested fine tartan cloth to be used for women&#x27;s clothing, because the fashion was to wear husbands&#x27; regimental tartans (not clan tartans). In 1829, responding negatively to the idea of Lowland and Borders &quot;clans&quot; wearing their own tartans, Sir Walter Scott – who was instrumental in helping start the clan-tartans fervour in the first place – wrote &quot;where had slept this universal custom that nowhere, unless in this [the draft &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot;, published ultimately in 1842] is it even heard of? ... I would rather suppose that the author had been some tartan-weaver zealous for his craft, who wished to extend the use of tartan over the whole kingdom.&quot; Also in the same year, he wrote: &quot;The idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date in the Highlands themselves&quot;.

Another of the tartan legends has it that Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, commissioned the design of a clan tartan based on Black Watch in 1793, kept one of three designs, then passed the other two on to cadet branches of the family. This tale can be traced in unembellished form to 1793 records of weaver William Forsyth of Huntly which do not say this at all, only that Forsyth provided three potential designs for a tartan, with yellow over-checks in various configurations, of which the Duke selected no. 2 for the unit, the 92nd Gordon Highlanders.

Scarlett (1990) surmises that there must have been informal clan tartans – a confluence of district tartans that had become associated with particular families, and adoptions of regimental uniform tartans by them – by the late 18th century, otherwise there is no explanation for where Stewart of Garth got the idea. Scottish United Services Museum curator Maj. I. H. Mackay Scobie (1942), Haswell Miller (1947), and Barnes &amp; Allen (1956), also zeroed in on this timeframe. Eslea MacDonald observes, for example, the Murrays using the common Tullibardine regional pattern in portraits and in bed hangings at their clan seat, Blair Castle, 1770 – c. 1780 and possibly earlier. Telfer Dunbar (1979), considering the 1703–04 Grant proclamation and the early regiments, suggests that &quot;any uniformity of tartan was only to be found in an organised body of troops, or the &#x27;tail&#x27; or following of a chief.&quot; These possible comparatively early, informal clan tartans of the late-18th-century simply cannot usually be identified (when they survived) until the early 19th century.

===19th century broad adoption===
It has been suggested by a modern chief of Clan Campbell and another of the clan executives that the clan had informally adopted what is now known as old Campbell or Black Watch tartan by the early 19th century, because so many of their men were already wearing it as part of regimental uniform (three of the Independent Highland Companies that amalgamated into the Black Watch regiment in 1739–1751 were Campbell units). Some time in or after 1806, when he became clan chief, the city-dwelling politician George Campbell, 6th Duke of Argyll, created his own personal tartan, of Black Watch with a thin over-check of white and yellow added, &quot;to differentiate himself from the rest of the Campbells&quot;, i.e. because they were already so often wearing Black Watch. This essentially may have been one of the earliest attested surviving clan tartans (and the duke&#x27;s variant was an early declared personal tartan of a noble).
The idea arose among Scottish expatriates (especially in the Celtic societies, which encouraged members to wear &quot;appropriate&quot; tartans), eager to &quot;preserve&quot; Highland culture, that tartans had traditionally been named and that the names represented clan affiliations. Among them was Maj.-Gen. David Stewart of Garth, a Black Watch veteran and vice-president of the Highland Society of London (founded 1778). He and fellow members Sir John Sinclair and Andrew Robertson were among the first proponents of the idea of clans being identified by tartans, despite the lack of evidence. The society also counted among its members the Prince of Wales (the future George IV, who was to become instrumental to clan &quot;tartanry&quot; in 1822) and two dukes, among various itinerant actual Scots – including James Macpherson of &quot;Ossian&quot; fame (or infamy).
On 8 April 1815, the society resolved that the clan chiefs each &quot;be respectfully solicited to furnish the Society with as much of the Tartan of his Lordship&#x27;s Clan as will serve to Show the Pattern and to Authenticate the Same by Attaching Thereunto a Card bearing the Impression of his Lordship&#x27;s Arms.&quot; Many had no idea of what their tartan might be or whether they had one, some provided only a vague description, and some claimed they had none. But plenty were keen to comply and to provide authentic signed and sealed samples; many (possibly most) turned to Wilsons of Bannockburn for a design, while some directly adopted a regimental tartan as their own, and still others adapted designs from old portraits of clan nobles. Alexander Wentworth Macdonald, Baron Macdonald, wrote back to the society: &quot;Being really ignorant of what is exactly The Macdonald Tartan, I request you will have the goodness to exert every Means in your power to Obtain a perfectly genuine Pattern, Such as Will Warrant me in Authenticating it with my Arms.&quot; Finding no agreement within his clan on a pattern, Robertson of Struan ended up adopting the regimental tartan of the Loyal Clan Donnachie (Robertson) Volunteers; being based on the Black Watch pattern, it could not pre-date the late 18th century. On the other hand, Sir John Macgregor Murray of Clan Gregor, who had spent most of his life in England and India, was writing instructions on the use of his clan&#x27;s tartan by December 1818. In 1819, Wilsons were engaged in correspondence to &quot;send ... specimens of all coloured Tartans used by these Clans ...said to exceed thirty in number&quot;, to a writer in Italy preparing a book on clan tartans; the same year, they also produced their &quot;Key Pattern Book&quot; of over 200 tartans (representing only a fraction of their total tartan output, presumably the most marketable designs, and not always under the same names as found in contemporary collections of Wilsons&#x27; tartan samples such as the Cockburn collection and that of the Highland Society).

According to Trevor-Roper (1983), Wilsons were in a direct &quot;alliance&quot; with the Highland Society of London by 1819; the former saw a great marketing opportunity, and the latter provided a veneer of respectability as Wilsons helped the society pin tartans to clan names. Banks &amp; de La Chapelle (2007) concur: &quot;The Wilson firm worked in tandem with the Highland Society, preparing tartan samples for the latter to certify as belonging to one clan or another.&quot; Clan nobles (who sometimes contradicted each other, within the same clan, on what their tartan was or should be) were apparently also &quot;ready to adopt changes at the mere dictation of fancy&quot; to improve designs. From the &quot;authentications&quot; they received 1815–26, the society built up a clan-tartan collection (now in the National Museum of Scotland), with 34 authenticated specimens and about 40 others. Other such societies generated more interest, belief, and demand. According to the analysis by Eslea MacDonald (2012), &quot;Most of the pieces sealed [by clan chiefs] and deposited with the Society at that time were patterns woven, and in the majority of cases appear to have been designed, by Wilsons. This obviously means they could not have existed prior to when William Wilson started his business.&quot; So many of Wilsons&#x27; stock tartans from their &quot;Key Pattern Book&quot; of 1819 were being renamed for clans that J. C. Thompson (1992) wrote: &quot;Clearly the naming of tartans was just getting started in 1819&quot;, and: &quot;There was nothing people wanted more than an ancient clan tartan system, and they were determined to have one.&quot; By 1821, advertisements for tartan cloth had shifted to include language like &quot;true&quot;, &quot;warranted&quot;, and &quot;original&quot;, and began to stress antiquity and family connections.

The 1822 visit of George IV to Scotland, in Highland garb and with a great deal of tartan-festooned public ceremony (arranged by Stewart of Garth and romanticist writer Sir Walter Scott of the Celtic Society of Edinburgh), had a profound tartan-boosting effect, including the invention of new clan-specific tartans to suit (or renaming of old tartans to have clan names), as clan chiefs had been asked to attend in clan tartans. It caused a boom in the tartan-weaving business, and a broader public notion that tartans should be named for families. &quot;When these two [Scott and Stewart of Garth] stage-managed the King&#x27;s visit ... they fixed the Clan Tartan idea in the public mind.&quot; Wilsons&#x27; pattern book in 1822 had expanded significantly with tartans named for clans, in addition to all their numbered setts. According to R. Martin (1988), Wilsons and other weavers were made aware of the king&#x27;s planned visit three or four years in advance, and had all that time to pad their catalogues with additional designs and to assign clan names to patterns often &quot;probably picked entirely out of the air.&quot; He added that &quot;anyone looking at the tartan pattern books of 1819 to 1822 would have realized the cacophony of different names for the same [pattern], the chaos of clan attributions, and the complete capriciousness of that association.&quot; A telling letter from a tailor, archived among the Wilsons papers, to the company in 1822 asked: &quot;Please send me a piece of Rose tartan, and if there isn&#x27;t one, please send me a different pattern and call it Rose.&quot;

By 1824, an invitation to the Atholl Gathering, one of the earliest of the modern Highland games festivals, made it clear that participants should arrive &quot;in the plaids or Tartans of their Clans&quot;. In 1829, Sir Thomas Dick Lauder complained to Walter Scott about all the &quot;uncouth, spurious, modern [tartans] which are every day manufactured, christened after particular names, and worn as genuine&quot;, and also of &quot;clans ... at this moment ignorantly disputing for the right to the same tartans which in fact belong to none of them but are merely modern inventions for clothing Regimental Highlanders&quot;. Scott himself was backpedalling away from what he had helped create, and was suspicious of the recent claims about &quot;ancient&quot; clan tartans: &quot;it has been the bane of Scottish literature and disgrace of her antiquities, that we have manifested an eager propensity to believe without inquiry and propagate the errors which we adopt too hastily ourselves.&quot;
A wave of highly dubious books were published, all purporting to reveal true clan histories and tartans; they presented little in the way of evidence, but they caused enthusiastic adoption of clan tartans. The first of these, in 1831, was &quot;The Scottish Gaël or Celtic Manners, as Preserved Among the Highlanders&quot; by James Logan, containing 54 tartans (based on Wilsons&#x27; collection, that of the Highland Society of London, and other sources he alleged but did not name, plus some he collected or devised himself); the author ignored advice from Wilsons on which were actually old tartans, and included some erroneous, fictitious, and incomplete setts. He also included untenable assertions about the designs&#x27; antiquity; &quot;Logan took the line that everything Highland was rooted impossibly far in the past&quot;, and was mocked in &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; for it. Meanwhile, Wilsons and other weavers simply adopted some patterns from his book due to demand, and also took to inventing all-new &quot;clan tartans&quot; to keep up with the growing market for patterns associated with names. The archived correspondence of Wilsons in the 1830s shows that the company was frequently pressured by merchants for the &quot;truest&quot; and &quot;real&quot; clan patterns. Logan, despite himself being involved in sham clan tartanry, observed that &quot;fanciful varieties of tartan ... were being passed off as genuine&quot; by Wilsons and other weavers.

Logan was followed in 1842 by &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot; by the so-called Sobieski Stuarts, purporting to contain 75 centuries-old clan tartans, illustrated in great detail but from vague textual descriptions. Although it is now known to have been largely a forgery, many of the visual tartan designs in this &quot;final – and fantastic – codification&quot; of clan tartans were nevertheless adopted and still survive as accepted tartans of clans, especially for Lowland clan names (which had hitherto never been associated with tartan or Highland garb at all). Starting in 1822, Borders families had been redefining themselves as clans, and the book encouraged more of them to take on clan tartans and open clan societies. Modern critics have even praised the lasting socio-cultural accomplishement of the Sobieski-Stuarts&#x27; works in helping establish a systemic clan-tartans legend while recognizing the bogus nature of their material.

Trevor-Roper (1983) believed that the Sobieski Stuarts had been in direct communication with manufacturers like Wilsons, and were advising clan chiefs on which tartans to choose, from as early as 1819; J. C. Thompson (1992) agreed. Dick Lauder certainly said they were doing so by 1829, and that Wilsons were already weaving many Sobieski Stuart samples by that year; the company&#x27;s own records the same year confirm orders for designs from the Sobieski Stuarts. &quot;Vestiarium&quot; was followed soon after by &quot;The Costume of the Clans&quot; published by the Sobieski Stuarts in 1845; the illustrations it provided, allegedly based on portraits, have proven to be largely a mixture of error and invention. By 1849, John Sobieski Stuart was in discussion with a publisher to produce a new, cheaper edition of &quot;Vestiarium&quot;, in a series of small volumes &quot;so that it might be rendered as available as possible to manufacturers and the trades in general concerned in Tartan ... and it was for the[ir] advantage and use ... that I consented to the publication.&quot; The same letter also proposed binding the manufacturers by contract to produce tartans that conformed exactly to the Sobieski Stuarts&#x27; specifications.

Weavers like Wilsons were complicit, not passive, in the tartan boom. They had lost much of their military and export markets after major wars ended and colonies in the Americas and elsewhere had become more self-sufficient. &quot;The concept of differentiated clan tartans, newly popularized, was codified and developed by canny manufacturers ... Since the repeal of the [Dress Act], these tartan makers saw the prospect of a vast new market.&quot; According to Alastair Campbell of Airds:


This heavy promotion for decades of the clan-tartans idea has been described as &quot;inciting a rush to lay claim to the tartan to which one&#x27;s family was &#x27;entitled. Other 19th-century clan-tartan works followed. Logan (by then president of the Highland Society of London) returned, with illustrator Robert Ranald McIan, with &quot;The Clans of the Scottish Highlands&quot; in several volumes 1843–1849, which had inconsistently hand-coloured portraits of chiefs in clan tartans, which he stated were &quot;acknowledged by the present chiefs and clans&quot;. &quot;The Clans of the Highlands of Scotland&quot; in 1850 by Thomas Smibert drew heavily on Wilsons&#x27; patterns and on Logan. In the same year, &quot;Authenticated Tartans of the Clans and Families of Scotland&quot; by William &amp; Andrew Smith was based on trade sources such as Wilsons, competing mill Romanes &amp; Paterson of Edinburgh, and army clothier George Hunter&#x27;s pre-1822 collection of setts (and some consultation with historian W. F. Skene). Also in 1850, Gen. James Browne published &quot;History of the Highlands and the Highland Clans&quot;, another &quot;Vestiarium&quot; knock-off.

In 1871, Gaelic folklorist and Highland dress fancier John Francis Campbell of Islay wrote in &quot;Clan Tartans&quot;:

J. Claude produced the tartan pattern sample book &quot;Clans Originaux&quot; in Paris c. 1880, and some tartans were adopted from it, though its 185 samples were mostly of already-known tartans. A second edition of &quot;The Costume of the Clans&quot; was published in 1892. Another influential book was Donald W. Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Old &amp; Rare Scottish Tartans&quot; (1893), which included swatches of fabric; several accepted clan tartans date to this work.

Books of this era also introduced lists of alleged clan septs, families of different surnames (often of English, Norman, or other non-Gaelic derivation) supposedly linked to particular clans as &quot;extended family&quot;. It was a means of greatly increasing tartan sales by attaching many more names to extant tartan designs, but not well-grounded in any historical reality. Two such works, both published by W. &amp; A. K. Johnston were: &quot;Tartans of the Clans and Septs of Scotland&quot; by James Grant in 1886, revised by Henry Whyte in 1906 in more of a picture-book format (three tartans make their first appearance in the 1886 edition, and various more in the 1906 version, with no provenance); and &quot;What Is My Tartan? or, The Clans of Scotland, with Their Septs and Dependents&quot; by Adam Frank in 1896.

The romanticised notion of clan tartans had become deeply embedded in the Scottish imagination and further afield. &quot;[I]t all got mixed up in the public mind and the myth of tartan as a kind of heraldry became established, not only in the eyes of outsiders, even the Clansfolk believed it&quot;. On the cusp of the Scottish Renaissance and Gaelic Revival, most clans (including major Lowland families) had been assigned and had generally accepted one or more tartans by the late 19th century.

===20th century consolidation===

The first Edwardian book on the subject (aside from a larger 1906 &quot;library edition&quot; of Whyte as &quot;The Scottish Clans and Their Tartans with Notes&quot;), was Frank Adam&#x27;s 1908 &quot;The Clans, Septs &amp; Regiments of the Scottish Highlands&quot;, which remains in print today (though in drastically edited form, by Sir Thomas Innes of Learney). A variety of books, with colour plates, had been affordably and widely published about clan tartans by the mid-20th century. Three popular ones were &quot;The Clans and Tartans of Scotland&quot; by Robert Bain, 1938 (the first to use photographic halftone prints; revised and updated many times through 1983); &quot;The Tartans of the Clans and Families of Scotland&quot; by Innes of Learney (later to become the Lord Lyon King of Arms as well as a founder of the Scottish Tartans Society), 1938, advancing some clan-tartanry ideas his Lord Lyon predecessor Sir Francis James Grant considered &quot;humbug&quot;; and &quot;The Scottish Clans &amp; Their Tartans&quot; published by W. &amp; A. K. Johnston, 1945 (later editions re-titled &quot;The Scottish Tartans with Historical Sketches&quot;, edited by Innes of Learney), and based on previous works by Grant and Whyte. Many others followed in successive decades.
The mass-market books (some with over 200 tartans illustrated) did much to cement the idea of clan tartans in the public imagination, as well as to consistently anchor particular tartans to particular clans. And the works were in more general agreement with one another than had been the Victorian &quot;authorities&quot;. They also simultaneously increased the number of clans with their own assigned tartans, and reduced the number of tartans claimed to be those of certain clans to a more manageable number, probably after consultation with clan chiefs and clan society officers. They did, however, typically include sept lists, which today are widely regarded as bogus (though many present-day clan associations still use them, as a means of attracting larger membership).

Almost every extant clan (with or without a chief) had at least one tartan associated with it by this era. Many clans have several well-accepted tartans. Sometimes they represent different branches of the family; e.g., there are separate tartans for Campbell of Breadalbane, Campbell of Cawdor, and Campbell of Loudoun, in addition to the general &quot;old&quot; Campbell tartan. In other cases, they are (at least ostensibly) for specific purposes such as hunting, mourning, formal dress occasions, or Highland dance competition; e.g., the MacFarlane dress and hunting tartans are different. 

An important, more scholarly work was 1950&#x27;s &quot;The Setts of the Scottish Tartans&quot; by Donald C. Stewart (son of the aforementioned D. W. Stewart). The younger Stewart has been hailed as &quot;the founder of serious tartan research&quot;; originated now-standard methods for indexing tartans; and would go on to help expose the &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot; as a fraud, in &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Forged Tartans&quot;, co-authored with J. Charles Thompson in 1980.

In the late 20th century to present, clan and other tartans also have been catalogued in databases. A small number of new official clan tartans (mostly specific-purpose &quot;side&quot; tartans, like dance tartans) were registered in tartan databases in the 21st century.

Regarding modern misrepresentations of clan tartans on historical figures in films and even museums, Scarlett (1990) wrote: &quot;so widely have the tartan myths been spread that any script- or guide-book writer will, in complete ignorance, write the most arrant nonsense and never think that it might not be true. ... Once false information has been disseminated by a supposedly authoritative body it is virtually impossible to correct it.&quot;

===Recognition by clan chiefs===
The &quot;officialness&quot; of clan tartans has varied widely, and still does today. Although it is possible for anyone to create a tartan and assign it any name they wish, the only person with the authority to make a clan&#x27;s tartan &quot;official&quot; is the chief.

Some clans have had no chiefs for some time, while only a majority subset of those with living chiefs in the modern era made direct proclamations as to their clan tartans and registered them with the Lord Lyon. Some time after the launch of the Scottish Register of Tartans (SRT) in 2009, the Lord Lyon stopped recording clan tartans, deferring to SRT for this purpose. Some of the clan tartans were simply adopted by custom, and have remained rather consistent into the 21st century. A clan booth at a Highland games event is likely to proudly display at least their best-known clan tartan, regardless whether a chief has declared it official.

However, some chiefs have been quite adamant about what their clan&#x27;s legitimate tartans are. Some time prior to 1890, George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell, is said to have specified the main Campbell tartan, as distinct from that of the Campbell of Cawdor sett, after a portrait had depicted him in the latter and also supposedly at the prompting of the War Office, perhaps with regard to Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders uniforms. Ian Campbell, 12th Duke of Argyll, Clan Campbell chief in the late 20th century, excoriated attempts to claim there were other than the four aforementioned particular Campbell tartans (and specifically rejected the personal-variant tartan of the 6th Duke). Similarly, Sir Malcolm MacGregor, chief of Clan Gregor, wrote in 2012 that only four MacGregor tartans (plus a newer dance tartan) are legitimate, out of 10 or more alleged ones found in a tartan database, which he blamed on &quot;indiscriminate commercialisation ... disingenuous and lead[ing] to confusion&quot;.

In at least one instance, a clan tartan appears in the coat of arms of a clan chief and is considered by the Lord Lyon as the &quot;proper&quot; tartan of the clan: The crest of the chief of Clan MacLennan is &quot;A demi-piper all Proper, garbed in the proper tartan of the Clan Maclennan&quot;.

Some chief-authenticated clan tartans are quite late arrivals. In 1961, the Clan Davidson main tartan was replaced (and registered with the Lord Lyon) by one of multiple disputed chiefs, Sir David Davidson of Allt Dinnie, with a design dating to 1893, in place of an older white-striped version. Chief Charles Shaw of Tordarroch in 1971 replaced the old Shaw tartan (a Black Watch variant based on a misprinted image in Logan &amp; McIan (1847)) with a new pair (dress and hunting) designed in 1969 by D. C. Stewart based on more historical sources. Clan Mar had no approved tartan until Chief Margaret of Mar registered one in 1978 (from a design that may pre-date 1850); their dress/red tartan was not adopted until 1992 (from a design dating to the 18th century). The MacLeod red tartan was approved by Chief John MacLeod of MacLeod in 1982, to join much longer-standing yellow and blue tartans of the clan; it was based loosely on what appears in a 1748 portrait of Chief Norman MacLeod by Allan Ramsay and Joseph van Aken. Baron David Lumsden of Cushnie-Lumsden in 1996 approved the Clan Lumsden hunting sett by Peter Eslea MacDonald (though technically the baron was just the chieftain of the Cushnie-Lumsden branch). In 1998, Chief Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry approved a 1958 design as the MacTavish dress tartan. In 2005, Chief Gillem Lumsden of that Ilk registered a new main Lumsden tartan with the Lord Lyon, based closely on that of a c. 1790 Lumsden family waistcoat. Also in 2005, a pattern for Duncan of Sketraw was approved by Chieftain John Duncan of Sketraw, based on a 1930s design. In 2007, Chief Fergus D. H. Macdowall of Garthland designed the Clan MacDowall tartan (the clan previously used MacDougall or Galloway district); he registered it with the Lord Lyon and Scottish Tartans Authority in 2008. The Cochrane hunting tartan was designed personally by Chief Iain A. D. B. Cochrane, Earl of Dundonald, in 2008. The Clan Carruthers tartan was approved by Chief Simon Peter Carruthers of Holmains in 2017.

==Modern general use==
Aside from regimental and clan usage, tartan has seen broad (and sometimes highly politicised) use by the general public in the modern era. By the 19th century, the Highland romantic revival, inspired by James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Ossian&quot; poems and the writings of Sir Walter Scott, led to wider interest in tartan and other things felt to be Gaelic and Celtic. Clubs like the Celtic societies welcomed Lowlanders, and tartan was rapidly appropriated as part of the Scottish national identity (and part of broader British dress as a familiar exoticism).

===Late Georgian===
The period of widened public interest in tartan and Highland dress after the repeal of the Dress Act in 1782 has been called the Highland Revival. While tartan had already seen more nationwide use from 1707, as a Scottish nationalism symbol against union with England, it was turned on its ear to become a romanticised symbol of union loyalism in the early 19th century, an era in which prominent conflicts caused a patriotic influence of military (including Highland) style on civilian clothing, even among women despite its overtly masculine focus. First among the northern gentry and later among the common people more broadly, there was a renewed interest in tartan and Highland dress, despite the long period of prohibition – largely due to the glory associated with the Highland regiments&#x27; exemplary service in various military campaigns. &quot;Highlandism&quot; became a romantic, mythologised (even fictionalised) and colourful escapism even as Lowland Scotland itself was becoming one of the most industrialised places on earth, and the entire nation was undergoing the social upheavals of union and empire, of large-scale warfare, of urbanisation, and of modernisation during the Scottish Enlightenment. The bloody French Revolution of 1789–1799 had also helped inspire a British setting aside of old Stuart and Hanoverian rivalry.

Before the clan tartans rush began in 1815, tartan was already being aggressively marketed to the general public as &quot;fancy&quot; cloth with names that commemorated famous events and people, even fictional characters from books and songs, e.g. &quot;Waterloo&quot;, &quot;Flora MacDonald&quot;, &quot;Sir Walter Scott&quot;, &quot;Wellington&quot;, &quot;Maggie Lauder&quot;, and &quot;Meg Merrilees&quot;. This inspired a novel perception that tartans should be named. Some of the designs by leading weaver Wilsons of Bannockburn by this period were considered recognisable on sight.

In 1822, Maj.-Gen. David Stewart of Garth, who was with both the Highland Society of London and the Celtic Society of Edinburgh, published &quot;Sketches of the Character, Manners, and Present State of the Highlanders of Scotland&quot;, the first of a number of 19th-century books lionising the Highlanders, the clans, and the tartaned regiments. The various Celtic/Highland societies throughout Britain had already been driving a rise in tartan demand since the late 18th century. The societies liked wearing Highland dress – in their own assimilated, urban idiom, such as tartan frock coats – and devising new tartans; it has been suggested that they were engaging in a sort of &quot;internal colonisation&quot;, imposing what they wanted to see rather than simply recording what was traditionally Highland. Aside from tartan fabric&#x27;s increasing use in non-Highland styles of clothing, Highland dress itself had already become highly stylised, quite removed from the simplicity of its peasant origins; this was a trend that would continue throughout the later Victorian period.

====The King&#x27;s jaunt in tartan====

The popularity of tartan was greatly increased by the royal visit of King George IV of the United Kingdom to Edinburgh in 1822, with other nobles including Lord Mayor of London Sir William Curtis, in Highland garb. George was the first reigning monarch to visit Scotland in 171 years. The pageantry invented for the event, which was nicknamed &quot;the King&#x27;s Jaunt&quot;, brought a sudden consumer-driven demand for tartan cloth and made it the national dress of the whole of Scotland. The 21 days of festivities were organised by the Jacobitism-romanticising but staunchly unionist Walter Scott, who was another co-founder of the Celtic Society of Edinburgh, and military officer David Stewart of Garth. They urged Scots (most of whom were Lowlanders) to attend &quot;all plaided and plumed in their tartan array&quot; in &quot;complete national costume&quot;. One contemporary writer sarcastically described the pomp that surrounded the celebrations as &quot;Sir Walter&#x27;s Celtified Pageantry&quot;, and another as a &quot;plaided panorama&quot;. Clan chiefs, expected to be kilted, had little choice but to take the event seriously, and arrived to show their loyalty in something of a panic, with tartaned retinues of half a dozen to up to 50 per clan (equipped at great expense, and with only about a month&#x27;s official notice), in a city overflowing with Highlanders, Lowlanders, and English spectators decked in tartan, a sight that Scott&#x27;s own son-in-law and biographer John Gibson Lockhart called a &quot;Celtic hallucination&quot;. Thousands of spectators attended the many events arranged for the visit. The formal ball, reserved for the gentry, required Highland dress for admittance, and some 300 tailors were employed to supply it.

The royal endorsement of tartan and Highland-wear did much to erase any lingering association of them with the servile peasant class of the Highlands (or the region&#x27;s bands of mountain bandits, for that matter). Because Scott had become &quot;the acknowledged preserver of Scotland&#x27;s past&quot; through his historical novels, the legend he helped create of tartan and Highland dress as a Scotland-wide tradition rooted in antiquity was widely and quickly accepted, despite its ignoring and erasing of cultural diversity within the country (of Gaels, Norse–Gaels, Scoto-Normans, and Lowlanders of largely Anglo-Saxon extraction). &quot;A bogus tartan caricature of [Scotland] had been drawn and accepted, even by those who mocked it, and it would develop in perspective and colour.&quot; George IV&#x27;s visit – which was not just theatrical but thoroughly political, in marrying Hanoverian power and loyalty to Stuart ideology and pride – has been described in by Angus Calder (1994) as the catalyst by which &quot;a Union of practical convenience became a Union of irrational love and fears, sublimated in militarism, tartanry, royalism and, eventually imperialism&quot;. R. Martin (1988) added: &quot;it would seem that this visit presages the acts of orchestrated political propaganda that we have come to know very well in the 20th century.&quot;
Following the royal visit, the tartan industry boomed, and the number of available tartans increased tenfold; in 1822, Wilsons&#x27; pattern book had numbered setts in the hundreds, and introduced many more with proper names. Scarlett (1990) writes that &quot;Tartan was no longer the dress of northern barbarians or political dissidents; it had become respectable and the garb of loyal subjects.&quot; Books which documented tartans began to appear and added to the &quot;tartanry&quot; craze. James Logan&#x27;s romanticised work &quot;The Scottish Gaël&quot; (1831) was the first such publication, and led the weaving industry to adopt new patterns, even Logan&#x27;s invented or erroneous ones.

The result of these flurries of attention has been described as an &quot;astonishing frenzy of excitement into which [patronage of tartanry] threw the citizens of Edinburgh and much of the rest of Scotland&quot;.

====Civilian spread====

From the 1820s, Georgian and then Victorian portraiture of clan nobles continued the earlier theme of regimentally re-styled Highland dress, with jewels, gold, and other symbols of aristocracy – a &quot;synthetic Gaelicism&quot;. The funerals of Sir John Macgregor Murray and Alasdair Ranaldson Macdonell of Glengarry, in 1822 and 1823 respectively, were marked by tartan, bagpipes, and &quot;wailing&quot; of clansmen – &quot;a feudal sight in an increasingly industrial age&quot;. A large public tartan affair was the 1824 Atholl Gathering (an annual event that, after a period of abeyance, continues to the present). From the end of proscription through the Georgian promotion, &quot;distrust of the Highlands became fascination&quot;, and tartan and Highland garb &quot;moved from the periphery to the very center, accompanied by all the processes of forgetting and imaginative re-creation&quot;. Tartan, no longer the everyday traditional dress of Highland &quot;barbarians&quot;, had become, in altered form, all the rage among the Scottish upper and even middle classes as formal attire. This popularisation of tartan increased its marketability in the Lowlands, in England, and in the colonies, and provided a boost to the Scottish textile industry.
Tartan had begun making appearances in civilian Georgian fashion throughout Britain and into continental Europe, as illustrated in publications such as London&#x27;s &quot;Gallery of Fashion&quot; (1787) and &quot;La Belle Assemblée&quot; (1808), and (after Paris was famously occupied by Highland regiments during the Waterloo campaign and the fall of Napoleon in 1815) in the French periodicals &quot;Le Prétexte&quot; (1815) and &quot;Costumes Parisiens&quot; (1826); tartan was in vogue in Paris in particular in this period, and approximations of Highland soldiers even appeared in Parisian plays at the time. Tartans associated with family names became popular, but there was also a brisk trade in new tartans commissioned for societies, to commemorate events, in honour of famous persons, and designed simply to personal aesthetic taste. Manufacturers struggled to keep up with demand. By 1819, dominant tartan weaver Wilsons of Bannockburn (also a carpet and ribbon weaver) was keenly interested in exploiting the civilian market, due to a reduction in regimental demand, and introduced many more patterns, providing cloth in various grades. By 1820, the company had access to 132 looms; they experienced a four-fold increase in output in 1821, leading up to George IV&#x27;s visit, after which they acquired 40 more looms in an add-on building, named the Royal George after the king, and expanded into a new mill in 1822, mechanising more and more to keep up with demand. They stopped weaving muslin to focus on tartan, and produced it in a range of qualities from finest merino wool to cheap linsey-woolsey blends, demonstrating that whatever high-class associations tartan had taken on, there was significant working-class demand. In 1829, a merchant wrote to Wilsons that &quot;We are like to be torn to pieces for tartan; the demand is so great we cannot supply our customers&quot;, and there was great demand for the newest patterns.
Georgian and later Victorian entrepreneurs not only created new tartans, but new tartan objects called &quot;tartanware&quot;, starting as far back as the proscription period in the form of wine glasses decorated with tartan and enamel Jacobite portraits. Tartan decorated an assortment of common household objects, such as snuffboxes, jewellery cases, tableware, sewing accessories, desk items, and even doorknobs and furniture – a tartan knick-knack market for tourists that continues through the present in the Highlands. Visitors to the Highlands went home with tartanware, and Scotland-based businesses sent tartanware out as gifts to customers. Some of the more popular tartans used were the Stewart, MacDonald, MacGregor, MacDuff, MacBeth, and one fancifully named &quot;Prince Charlie&quot;. Today, tartanware is widely collected in England and Scotland. There was a symbiotic relationship between tartanware production and interest in tartans generated by books on the subject: a tartanware manufacturer from 1820 onward was W. &amp; A. Smith, of Mauchline, also incidentally the publishers of &quot;Authenticated Tartans of the Clans and Families of Scotland&quot; (1850).; tartanware was sometimes more specifically called Mauchlinware.

===Victorian===

Leading up to the beginning of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign in 1837, tartan was a brisk trade in London, Manchester, and other English cities and towns. In 1839, the Eglinton Tournament, a medieval re-enactment featuring jousting and a ball, was organised in North Ayrshire by Archibald Montgomerie, Earl of Eglinton; it drew some 100,000 spectators, who had been asked to attend in plaids, and included George Murray, Duke of Atholl, arriving with an entire regiment in tartan, his newly re-formed Atholl Highlanders (which still exists as Europe&#x27;s last remaining private military force).
====&quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot;====
The first publication showing colour plates of an array of tartans was the &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot; (meaning &#x27;wardrobe of the Scots&#x27;), published in 1842, and it included a first: tartans for Lowland families. It was the work of two brothers: John Carter Allen and Charles Manning Allen, from Surrey, England, who used a variety of assumed names. The two implied they were grandsons of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, and consequently later became known as the &quot;Sobieski Stuarts&quot;. They claimed further that the &quot;Vestiarium&quot; was based on a 1571 manuscript on clan tartans – a manuscript which they never managed to produce. It was not known at the time, but many of the tartans were simply invented by the brothers, and others were taken from early-19th-century sources like the Cockburn and Wilson collections. The brothers heavily favoured basic checks, or crudely divided checks, with thin over-checks added; they had an identifiable style of tartans, assessment of which has varied from &quot;few can be called inspired&quot; to &quot;quite novel and singularly gorgeous&quot;. The &quot;Vestiarium&quot; was followed by their equally dubious &quot;The Costume of the Clans&quot; in 1845. The books, which &quot;added mystery, romance and some spurious historical documentation to the subject&quot;, triggered another wave of interest in tartans, and the enthusiasm generated by these publications led the way for numerous tartan books in the later 19th century.

The sudden availability (and almost unquestioning acceptance) of Lowland tartans helped spread tartan further in popularity. &quot;The [tartan] cult was gathering strength and tartan was no longer &#x27;Highland&#x27;, it had become &#x27;Scottish&#x27;.&quot;

====The Queen and &quot;Balmorality&quot;====

Twenty years after her uncle&#x27;s royal visit to Scotland, Victoria and her husband Prince Albert made their first trip to the Scottish Highlands in 1842; she was the first monarch to set foot in the Highlands since Mary, Queen of Scots, in the 16th century. The visit involved her large royal party being met with several theatrical tartan-kilted welcomes by Highland nobility and their retinues, with much sycophantic newspaper fanfare (while the common people were experiencing considerable misery); the Queen wrote: &quot;It seemed as if a great chieftain in olden feudal times was receiving his sovereign&quot;. The monarch&#x27;s early trips to Scotland were seen as a royal endorsement and had a transformative effect on the image of the country, as a now-loyal land of tartan, pipers, and kilted martial display.

Victoria and Albert leased Balmoral Castle, in Aberdeenshire, in 1848 (and bought it in 1852) as a private royal demesne and hired a local architect to re-model the estate in feudalised Scots baronial style, starting a &quot;sham-castles&quot; trend. Prince Albert personally took care of the interior design, where he made great use of tartan. He used the royal Stewart (red) and the hunting Stewart (green) tartans for carpets, while using the dress Stewart (red and white) for curtains and upholstery. Prince Albert (who often wore the kilt at Balmoral) is said to have created the Balmoral tartan, still used as a royal tartan today. They even decorated their carriage with tartan. Their adoption of a showy form of Highland dress inspired adoption by subject &quot;who would have previously left Highland dress to the festivals of the Scots.&quot;

The royal couple spent a considerable amount of time at their Scottish estate (nearly 7 years in total), and in doing so hosted &quot;Highland&quot; activities. Victoria was attended by pipers, and her children were attired in Highland dress. Prince Albert himself loved watching the Highland games and the pair became patrons of the Braemar Gathering. (Support from and attendance by various nobles may have helped preserve such events to the present, but it also &quot;tartanised&quot; them permanently, all the way into the 21st century.) The royal enthusiasm for and patronage of Highland things generated more early tourism to the Highlands, and a boost to business in the region as far as Perth and Edinburgh. It also spread tartan-wearing to other northern British lords and ladies, who began to invent complicated etiquette rules of dress for Highland garb, which had the effect of increasing the sense that it was upper-class attire. Adoption of tartan continued to spread into England; Thomas Osborne, Duke of Leeds, in West Yorkshire, devised a livery tartan for his men in 1848. Tartan, though a &quot;pseudo-Caledonian masquerade&quot;, had become &quot;the stuff of loyalty to the crown&quot;, with &quot;a spurious royal and aristocratic cachet&quot;. This royal promotion was also noted abroad, with the effect that tartan became one of the widest-recognised cultural-identity symbols for the entire British country.

Despite their considerable devotion to charity (up to 20% of their Privy Purse income), Victoria and Albert, along with their friends in the northern gentry, have been accused of using their &quot;Balmorality&quot; – a term coined by George Scott-Moncrieff (1932) to refer to upper-class appropriation of Highland cultural trappings, marked by &quot;hypocrisy&quot; and &quot;false sentiment&quot; – to trivialise and even fictionalise history. According to Fiona K. Armstrong (2017), they engaged in long-term, tartan-blanketed escapism from the uncertainties of modernising, industrialised society and from pressing British societal problems, while worsening those problems in the actual Highlands. The queen&#x27;s Balmoral residency also had another detrimental effect on the Scottish Highlands; inspired by her residency, aristocrats who lived outside the Highlands began purchasing estates in the region, resulting in land-ownership disparities that persist into the present day. The Highlands during Victoria&#x27;s reign also became more accessible by road, rail, and boat.
As the tartan and &quot;romantic Highlands&quot; craze swept over Scotland, the real Highland population suffered grievously from the Hungry Forties as well as the Highland Clearances, when thousands of Gaelic-speaking Scots from the Highlands and Isles were evicted by landlords (often the very men who would have been their clan chiefs) to make way for sheep and for expansive deer-hunting preserves. Scots were also largely disenfranchised from voting, and the Highlands were running out of young men, in great regimental demand to fight and die in foreign wars for the empire, and many emigrating otherwise, with Victoria and Albert directly patronising emigration societies. Nearly 2 million Scots moved to non-European destinations during the Victorian era (more than half the native-born Scottish people of the period), and took a measure of Highlandism with them – &quot;many of the generally understood images of the Highlands were held to be &#x27;real&#x27; by people at the time&quot;. This would have strong tartan-promoting results among the Scottish diaspora later; Scarlett (1990) calls it a &quot;tartan hunger that has been abroad from late Victorian times to the present day&quot;.

====Ripple effects====
Thomas Babington Macaulay wrote in 1848 of the romantic reinvention of Highland customs as somehow Scottish: &quot;Soon the vulgar imagination was so completely occupied by plaids, targets, and claymores, that, by most Englishmen, &quot;Scotchman&quot; and &quot;Highlander&quot; were regarded as synonymous words.&quot; In 1849, Sir John Graham Dalyell asserted that &quot;forty years ago no reputable gentleman would have appeared in a kilt in the streets of Edinburgh.&quot; Scott-Moncrieff (1932) likewise wrote of tartans being &quot;misconceived&quot; and worn all over Scotland (and even England) in the Victorian era as a part of the Queen&#x27;s influence. Increasingly-urban Scotland was putting on a &quot;rural face&quot; (a trend that would continue with &quot;kailyard&quot; literature). Tartanry and Highlandism were popular in part as a counter to a sense (especially among the aristocracy) that Scotland was losing its separate national identity in the Georgian to Victorian era, being ever more Anglicised as just &quot;North Britain&quot; amid empire-wide modernisation.
In an 1849 letter to a publisher about a planned second edition of &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot;, John Sobieski Stuart noted that tartan had become &quot;extensively worn and manufactured&quot; on the continent, as far away as France, Germany, Bohemia, and Hungary; he also expressed an interest in working directly with tartanware and tartan book makers W. &amp; A. Smith of Mauchline. The same year, the Duke and Duchess of Atholl (whose entire estate was prescribed tartan livery) hosted a Highland-dress affair in London, the Royal Caledonian Ball, the first known charity ball (still a sold-out annual event today). The 1859 opening of the massive Loch Katrine waterworks (to pump fresh water to Glasgow, running out of well water) was attended by Queen Victoria, with the Atholl Highlanders (cannon in tow), the Celtic Society of Glasgow, and an honour-guard unit called the Glasgow Volunteers putting on a tartan- and piper-laden display for the newspapers; it was a confluence of modern engineering and romantic–patriotic tartanry. When the Prince Consort died in 1861, Victoria commissioned a tartan-kilted statue of Albert at Balmoral by William Theed.

According to Jonathan Faiers (2008), Victoria had actually intentionally made tartan more popular for the benefit of the British textile industry. By the 1860s, tartan was not only as popular in London as in Scotland, leading weaver Wilsons of Bannockburn produced £80,000 of product per year, and employed 500–600 people. (It amalgamated with another of the family businesses, a carpet-weaving operation, in 1867, which continued to 1924.) Around 1860, new synthetic aniline dyes allowed for production of tartans in vivid colours at more affordable prices, and their lower cost translated into more consumption of tartan by the middle class.
As modernisation marched on, the world&#x27;s first permanent colour photograph, taken by Thomas Sutton (using the three-colour process developed by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell) in 1861, was of a tartan ribbon. It was created by using red, blue, and yellow filters to create three photographs which were then combined into a composite. R. Martin (1988) notes that there was a confluence of unrelated technological &quot;junctions and serendipities&quot; in the mid-19th century that together broadly promoted tartan, including photography, consistently bright and more economical artificial dyes, affordable colour book printing, mass-production of soft but durable fine textiles, and applicability of printed patterns to middle-class products like tartanware – all &quot;far-removed from the true peasant history of tartan.&quot; Ian Brown (2012), a professor with a focus on Scottish literature and culture, has written that while George IV and Victoria (not to mention business interests in their wake, like the Wilsons of Bannockburn and the Smiths of Mauchline) seemed to have been &quot;the winner taking over the loser&#x27;s tokens&quot;, the renewed public interest in tartan within and beyond Scotland was not entirely owing to them, especially given the international interest in Highland-romantic works of Walter Scott and &quot;Ossian&quot;. The acceptance of and even enthusiasm for tartan among the post-proscription upper class can be seen as a necessary attempt at reconciliation within a culturally diverse country, and the influence ran both ways, with old Scottish nationalism transmuting into a new unionism that demanded recognition of Scottish interests and institutions. &quot;In short, it is an open question whether George IV in a kilt and Victoria and Albert at Balmoral are appropriating and subverting a set of values, or whether they are being appropriated and subverted.&quot; Even the 1822 &quot;King&#x27;s Jaunt&quot; had been stage-managed by two Scots with a keen interest in romanticising and promoting Gaelic and broader Scottish culture (historico-traditional accuracy notwithstanding), and the Atholls&#x27; deep and tartan-arrayed involvement in Victoria&#x27;s activities in the north can be viewed in the same light. Both George IV and Victoria, primarily of German House of Hanover stock, came to identify strongly with their quite thin Scottish House of Stuart genealogy.
The 1863 funeral of the Duke of Atholl was another anachronistically feudal, tartan-and-pipers pageant. In 1866–1870, Victoria and the Duchess of Atholl commissioned artist Kenneth MacLeay in Edinburgh to produce a series of watercolours of statuesque men in tartan Highland gear, representing common people from ghillies to shepherds and fishermen, &quot;as they are&quot;. Prints were published in 1870 as &quot;Highlanders of Scotland: Portraits Illustrative of the Principal Clans and Followings, and the Retainers of the Royal Household at Balmoral&quot;, with text by Amelia (Emily) Murray MacGregor, an attendant of Victoria as well as a Clan Gregor historian and the first female Gaelic lecturer. A tartanistical fantasy, as well as another exercise in &quot;Highlander as noble savage&quot;, the art book necessitated canvassing Scottish aristocrats for outfits and suitable models (&quot;specimens&quot;), as the everyday people did not look the hyper-masculine part, were not able to afford such Highland-dress extravagances as were to be illustrated, and were more likely to be wearing trousers than kilts. The resulting book is the most detailed record of the &quot;proper&quot;, codified Victorian-era Highland dress and accessories, which &quot;removed tartan from its blustery nonchalance to an ordered set of adornments&quot; – most of which survive to the present, Highland dress being remarkably resistant to further major stylistic changes, Victorian styles having become &quot;traditional&quot;. Tartan had also become more established throughout the 1850s and 1860s as a textile for European-fashionable rather than Highland women&#x27;s clothing, from bodices and dresses to sashes and shawls (the never-extinguished ladies&#x27; plaids). The tartan sash in particular was a favourite of the Queen, and remains a common womenswear option, worn several different ways in modern Highland dress, though it has little to do with original Highland clothing before the 19th century; it is an adaptation of the plaid to a style of the European nobility.

In 1871, at the Waverley Ball, a fancy dress affair in London, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII) and his brother Prince Arthur, long accustomed to Highland dress, arrived tartaned out as an old-time Lord of the Isles and as Bonnie Prince Charlie, respectively. In 1872, ethnologist Jacob Falke wrote that &quot;In Scotland indeed the plaid has still some importance, but it is an object of manufacture, and ... its motives have long ago become the common property of fashion, and indeed have become so permeated by it that what is genuine and old in it is scarcely to be recognised&quot;. Since its 1880 re-opening, the Gaelic Society of Perth in the Lowlands held festivities that involved much piping and tartan-wear, into the early 20th century, despite the language-preservation organisation having nothing to do with Highland dress or ; being swathed in tartan had somehow become vital to such events. By 1883, Highland dress as proper courtly attire had become highly regulated, aristocratic, and formal, but &quot;inclusive&quot; in one sense – the tartan-wear was permitted at court for essentially anyone claiming Highland origins or land-ownership (even if natively English), not just the gentles of the well-established clans.

In the Victorian era, tartan garments for women as well as men continued to be featured in fashion catalogues, in styles not derived from Highland costume, such as everyday suits and dresses. Tartan had also become popular for children&#x27;s clothing in continental Europe, inspired by the royal children of Victoria. In the United States, tartan was similarly worked into school uniforms, especially at Catholic schools. The late 19th century saw tartan (sometimes in silk) in fashion throughout Europe, including in France (e.g. Paris, Lyon, and Alsace) and Italy, and as far from Britain as Russia. Founded in 1898, Walker&#x27;s Shortbread has long been sold in royal Stewart tartan packaging around the world (especially for Christmas and Hogmanay).

===20th century to present===

In the Edwardian era, tartan had become less a component of men&#x27;s clothing (with the decline in kilt-wearing) but more an important part of women&#x27;s fashion, including fanciful designs from Paris that had no connection to Highland style, and many accessories such as petticoats, stockings, and blouses; masculine accessories included braces (suspenders), neckties, cummerbunds, and socks.

Edward VII himself had grown up wearing Highland dress frequently. There was also in this period into the 1920s a market for Highland-dress etiquette booklets, which tied into the era&#x27;s &quot;dress sense&quot; of decorum and class . Because of its associations with the British aristocracy, Scottish clans, and Highland military, tartan had developed an air of dignity and exclusivity. Because of this, tartan was to make periodic resurgences in the world of fashion. The tartan uniforms of the Scottish Regiments were an important recruiting tool during World War I; as Archibald Primrose, Lord Rosebery, put it: &quot;there is nothing so magnificent in our army as the swing of a kilted regiment&quot;. Tartan&#x27;s Georgian re-orientation as a symbol representing unionism and empire continued well into the first half of the 20th century, though outright tartanry and Highlandism on the part of the upper class waned, especially after about 1920. Nevertheless, Edward VIII, later Duke of Windsor, was a life-long devotee of tartan, often wearing more than one at a time.
Tartan patterns (often simple, unnamed ones) remained commonly used for skirts and pinafore dresses (jumper dresses) in Catholic and other private school uniform codes in North America and also in public and private schools in New Zealand. The style spread to many other places, including South America, Japan (which sometimes imports tartan directly from Scotland), and Hong Kong.
Harry Lauder (properly Sir Henry – he was knighted for his war-effort fundraising during World War I) became world-famous in the 1910s and 1920s, on a dance hall and vaudeville entertainment platform of tartan Highland dress, a thick Scots accent, and folksy songs about an idealised, rural Scotland, like his hit &quot;Roamin&#x27; in the Gloamin&#x27;&quot;. At one point, he was the highest-paid performer in the world, and toured the United States, Australia, South Africa, and of course the UK to sold-out audiences. A Lowlander himself, Lauder has been credited with (and blamed for) keeping alive a tartanry-and-Highlandism image of Scotland, with critics calling him a &quot;kilted clown&quot; who promoted the idea of Scotsmen &quot;clothed like the chieftain of Clan McCrazy&quot;.

====Diaspora and globalisation====
By the mid-20th century, annual Highland games events, modelled on the traditional events in Scotland, had been established not just in Scotland but throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, among other places with a notable Scottish diaspora, which totals about 50 million people worldwide. There are dozens of such events in Scotland, and at least 260 annual Highland games events worldwide as of 2000, more than 100 of them in the US alone, and dozens more in Canada. They are closely intertwined with bagpipe band competitions (which date to 1781), a lasting source of tartan imagery in their regiment-inspired Highland uniforms.
The games&#x27; rather flamboyantly tartaned subculture is sustained outside Scotland primarily by multi-generational Scottish descendants rather than by direct Scottish expatriates.
Tartan Day, an annual symbolic ethnicity holiday among the Scottish diaspora, is a growing affair celebrated on 6 April, the date on which the Declaration of Arbroath was signed in 1320. Tartan Day was first declared in Nova Scotia in 1987, and was essentially nation-wide in Canada by the 1990s. It has since spread to Australia (with varying levels of official recognition, 1989–1996), the US (1998), and other places including New Zealand, and even Argentina and Paris, France. In New York City, it has turned into an entire Tartan Week since 1999, with honorary &quot;grand marshals&quot; that are usually Scottish celebrities.

The term &quot;tartanism&quot; (as distinct from &quot;tartanry&quot;) has been coined by Ian Brown (2012) for this international tokenisation of tartan as an ethnic-identity symbol, evolving to some degree independently to suit diasporic cultural needs and unrestrained by the views of the originating Scottish &quot;home&quot; culture. According to Ian Maitland Hume (2001), tartan and the kilt are powerful symbols that &quot;encapsulate many facets of a heritage which people aspire to access ... a part-mythical family origin for those seeking roots&quot;.

The Scottish Tartans Museum and Heritage Center was opened by the Scottish Tartans Society in 1988 in Highlands, North Carolina; in 1994, it moved to nearby Franklin. The museum, which runs independently of STS, features over 600 tartans on display, including specimens dating to c. 1725, and Highland dress examples to ca. 1800. (STS also operated a Scottish Tartans Museum in Edinburgh, but it closed when STS did in 2000.) A major exhibition on tartan was produced by the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York 1988–89, and another was created for the Edinburgh Festival in 1989. Others followed in Italy in 2003, and Japan in 2018. In April 2023, the Victoria and Albert Museum of Dundee (V&amp;A Dundee) opened a design exhibit (running until January 2024) about tartan and its &quot;shifting context&quot;, with goals of &quot;challenging preconceptions of what tartan is, whether that be from a historical sense or fashion sense&quot;.

D. Gordon Teall of Teallach, of the Scottish Tartans Society, observed in 1994:
Even as tartan has been bent to the cultural needs of the diaspora, as &quot;the most straightforward and outward sign of ... affinity with Scottishness&quot;, and bent to the commercial intents of fashion, tourism, entertainment, and other industries, tartan&#x27;s reception by native Scots in Scotland has been less favourable for decades, even the last century or so. Reasons include a feeling that it is not really a symbol of broad Scottish national identity because of its specifically Gaelic and Highland origin; the &quot;Highlandist&quot; and imperialist foisting of it on the entire country as national costume in the late Georgian through Victorian eras; distorted views of Scottish people promulgated by Lauder and other tartaned entertainers of a century ago; an academic view of tartary and Lowland kailyard literature as two halves of a low-brow, romanticising vulgarity (reinforced in recent decades by the &quot;Tartan Army&quot; fandom of the Scotland national football team reinvigorating a working-class attachment to kilts and tartan); and historically inaccurate portrayal of Scotland by tartan-heavy Hollywood productions like &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1954) and &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995). Brancaz (2016) argues that &quot;looking at tartan through the lens of the intelligentsia fails to account for its enduring appeal and resilience. ... [T]he wearing of kilts and tartans at weddings, funerals, and in Scotland has increasingly been interpreted as a form of cultural reappropriation.&quot;

====Industry and politics====
In 2006, the British Ministry of Defence sparked controversy when it allowed foreign woollen mills to bid for the government contracts to provide the tartans used by the Scottish troops (newly amalgamated as battalions into the Royal Regiment of Scotland), and lowered the formerly very high standards for the cloth.

Following a bill submitted in the Scottish Parliament in February 2007, Scotland&#x27;s enterprise minister announced in July 2007 that the National Archives of Scotland would set up a national register of tartans. The announcement stated that &quot;Tartan&#x27;s importance to Scotland cannot be overestimated. It is deeply embedded in Scottish culture and is an internationally recognised symbol of Scotland.&quot; This was later reiterated in 2013 through the BBC. The ministry cited an industry report indicating that &quot;the tartan industry is a significant contributor to the overall Scottish economy; and larger ... than suggested by previous industry estimates&quot;, and is the basis for some 200 businesses, 4,000 jobs, and £350 million in annual GDP in Scotland. The bill passed in October 2008, and the Scottish Register of Tartans launched in February 2009. 
&quot;The Observer&quot; reported in 2010 that tartan clothing had become more popular than ever before, crossing subcultural, social-class, and age-group lines, and showing in that year a 540% sales increase in Britain from only two years earlier. Around the same time, there began a resurgence in tartan kilt wearing among Scottish young people &quot;as a mark of a vibrant, modern Scotland&quot;. This has interrupted a generations-long trend of native Scottish disaffection toward tartan as stereotyping kitsch. An online survey by BBC in 2012 found that 52% of respondents strongly or very strongly disagreed with the premise &quot;Walter Scott&#x27;s re-branding of all Scots as tartan-wearing Highlanders has been a hindrance to Scotland&#x27;s cultural development&quot;, and only a third agreed. Tartan in mainstream, international fashion experienced another resurgence starting in 2019.

Contemporary Scottish nationalism has been said to be &quot;fed, in part, by tartan and Jacobite nostalgia&quot;. After avoidance of tartan since the 1970s (especially by Scottish liberals), the cloth has been politicised again as a nationalist symbol (as it was in the early 18th century), especially during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum and in the Scottish National Party&#x27;s 2015 campaign. (Perhaps owing to this messaging shift, the VisitScotland agency around the same time changed its tourism advertising to minimise, though not eliminate, tartan imagery.) Murray Pittock (2002) writes that the neo-Jacobitism is &quot;both irritating kitsch and a language of identity&quot; for modern Scots. After several decades of intellectual hostility toward tartan (e.g. in Tom Nairn&#x27;s 1977 &quot;The Break-up of Britain: Crisis and Neo-nationalism&quot;, and Hugh Trevor-Roper&#x27;s posthumous 2008 &quot;The Invention of Scotland&quot;), an &quot;academic re-assessment of tartan&quot; began in the early 21st century, relying on a wider range of early and modern source material, in historiographical, multidisciplinary edited volumes including &quot;Scottish History: The Power of the Past&quot; (eds. Edward J. Cowan and Richard J. Finlay, 2002) and &quot;From Tartan to Tartany&quot; (ed. Ian Brown, 2010).

Major commercial weavers (tartan mills) of traditional tartan cloth that are operating today include Lochcarron of Scotland in Lochcarron and Selkirk; Ingles Buchan in Glasgow; House of Edgar (also a Highland dress vendor, and a subsidiary of Macnaughton Holdings) in Perth; Johnstons of Elgin (also a wool clothing maker), Strathmore Woollen in Forfar, and D. C. Dalgliesh in Selkirk, all three of which are now part of the Edinburgh-based Scotweb, under the trade name Clan; Prickly Thistle (also a women&#x27;s clothing maker) in Evanton and Edinburgh; The Tartan Weaving Mill (also a weaving museum, and a subsidiary of Gold Brothers) in Edinburgh; Andrew Elliot Ltd in Selkirk; Stevens &amp; Graham (specialising mostly in tartan rugs and carpet) in Rutherglen; Marton Mills in West Yorkshire, England; Cambrian Woollen Mill, in Powys, Wales; West Coast Woollen Mills in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; GK Textiles in Port Moody, BC (formerly Fraser &amp; Kirkbright, Vancouver); and Pendleton Woolen Mills in Portland, Oregon, US. The modern trade in wool tartan fabric has three principal markets: Highland dress, high fashion (with significant business from France and Italy), and furnishing.

Popular tartans (including for kilts and other Highland dress, as well as for school uniforms) have increasingly been manufactured, primarily in the UK, in poly-viscose (PV), a blend of the artificial materials polyester and viscose (rayon), typically in a 65% polyester to 35% viscose ratio. PV is promoted as washable, durable, crease-resistant but heat-settable for permanent pleating, shrinkage-resistant, stain-resistant, colour-fast, low-pilling, hypoallergenic, not attractive to clothes moths, more &quot;breatheable&quot; than polyester (thus good for athletics), lower cost than wool, and lighter weight than wool, but said to have a wool-like texture. It also does not rely on animal industry, so it appeals to vegans. Large-scale global manufacturers of tartan-patterned cloth in a variety of cotton, polyester, viscose, nylon, etc., materials and blends include Başkan Tekstil in Istanbul and Bursa, Turkey; and Jeen Wei Enterprises in Taichung, Taiwan; while a leading maker of tartan ribbon is Satab in Saint-Just-Malmont, France. Tartan designs have long been produced in low-cost cotton in large quantities in China.

Carol Craig (2003) writes: &quot;Like it or not, tartan is a very sophisticated branding and marketing tool for Scotland.&quot; In a tartan-as-marketing analysis, Paterson (2001) observed that continued internationalisation of tartan manufacture, design, and consumption has diluted the associative &quot;Scottishness&quot; of tartan and its value as a national identifier. He blames this in part on Scottish weavers&#x27; failure to adapt to market demands for a wider range of fabric applications, as well as the businesses&#x27; own complicity in broadening tartan&#x27;s perceived cultural identity, e.g. in creating tartans for non-Scottish families, places, and organisations.

====In popular culture====

In 1947, the tartan-laden Broadway musical &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (followed by a film version in 1954 and a television adaptation in 1966) renewed an excessively romanticised notion of the Highlands and Highland dress. A critical review called it a &quot;whimsical dream-world&quot; that was &quot;overloaded with Hollywood-Scottish trappings&quot;. (The production is generally not well received by actual Scots.)

Tartan suits were popular in the mod subculture of Great Britain of the early to mid-1960s and its late 1970s revival.
Since the 1970s, the fandom of the Scotland men&#x27;s national football (soccer) team have been collectively referred to by the nickname &quot;Tartan Army&quot;, with fans often sporting tartan clothing (including kilts) at matches.
Popular in the mid-1970s, Scottish teeny-bopper band the Bay City Rollers were described by the &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; reference book as &quot;tartan teen sensations from Edinburgh&quot;.
Tartan became a common element of punk subculture starting in the late 1970s. Punk music was a way for youth in the British Isles to voice their discontent with the ruling class and with modern society. The unorthodox use of tartan (especially the royal Stewart), which had long been associated with authority and gentility, was then seen as an expression of that discontent. In this way, tartan – worn unconventionally – became an anti-establishment symbol. This was entirely on purpose according to Vivienne Westwood, a designer deeply involved in early punk fashion; the idea was &quot;to seize the very fabric of the Establishment in order to reverse its meaning and perhaps to challenge society&#x27;s design.&quot; American punks often wore tartan skirts, a &quot;subversion&quot; of the Catholic school-girl uniform, and kilts have also been worn in the punk scene since the late 1970s, especially in the UK. Baggy tartan pants later proved popular among pop-punks and skate punks, and tartan-lined jackets among ska punks. From the late 1990s, kilts (mostly modernised &quot;utility kilts&quot; but sometimes traditional ones) have become relatively popular even in North American post-punk subculture (e.g. the goth–industrial, emo, and steampunk scenes), though often in black rather than tartan.

After the 1970s, Westwood, who continued to work extenstively with tartan, was joined by other big-name . These included Ralph Lauren and Laura Ashley, whose designs promoted tartan as a mainstream modern clothing option &quot;with traditional grace and style&quot; for both women and men; Stephen Sprouse, credited with a 1980s combination of &quot;uptown sophistication in clothing with a downtown punk and pop sensibility&quot;; and later Alexander McQueen, who was &quot;consciously repoliticising the cloth&quot;. Others have included Jean Paul Gaultier, Tommy Hilfiger (who made tartan central to his fall 2000 collection), Christian Lacroix, Yves Saint Laurent, Giorgio Armani, and Gianfranco Ferré. A tartan outfit designed by Westwood featured on a commemorative UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail in 2012 celebrating &quot;Great British Fashion&quot;.

Tartan/plaid flannel shirts, emblematic of the working class, re-entered mainstream fashion through a series of subcultural adoptions, originating primarily in the western United States. First, the style became a staple of cholo style in and around Los Angeles, from the 1970s. From there, the style later became adopted by hip hop fashion in the 1990s, especially the West Coast hip hop lifestyle. Tartan flannel shirts also became quintessentially part of (and androgynous within) the grunge scene (starting in Seattle) of the late 1980s to 2000s. There was fashion cross-pollination between these youth-culture movements, and the fashion industry has found this confluence very marketable.

A resurgence of interest in tartan and kilts (and even Scottish tourism) has been generated in recent times by major Hollywood productions like the &quot;Highlander&quot; franchise (1986–2007), &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994), &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995), &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1995), &quot;Brave&quot; (2012), and the television series &quot;Outlander&quot; (2014–, with a follow-on travelogue documentary series, &quot;Men in Kilts&quot;). Many of these featured custom-designed tartans.

Tartan clothing has appeared frequently in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) wore a Wallace tartan scarf on &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot;, and his robot-dog companion K9 had a tartan collar. The Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) had a signature patchwork frock coat that included segments in three different tartans, and also typically wore a tartan waistcoat in a fourth sett under it. The Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) wore a crimson and black tartan scarf on &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;. Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman), the companion of the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) and the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi), wore a Campbell tartan dress on &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; and a Wallace skirt on &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; and &quot;Deep Breath&quot;. Annabel Scholey as Claire Brown, in the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) serial &quot;Flux&quot;, wears a 1960s-style muted tartan dress. The Fourteenth Doctor (David Tennant) wore a brown tartan suit in the 60th anniversary specials.

==Popular designs==
One of the most popular tartans is the royal Stewart, ostensibly the personal tartan of the British monarch, since George IV declared it his own (though it was probably designed by the Sobieski Stuarts, albeit based on mid-18th-century pattern called &quot;Prince Charles Edward Stuart&quot;). The &quot;royal&quot; sett was first published in 1831 in the book &quot;The Scottish Gaël&quot; by James Logan. In addition to its use in clothing, such as skirts and scarves, royal Stewart tartan has also appeared on biscuit tins for Scottish shortbread, and it has also long been favoured by the British punk scene.

Another tartan in very common use by the general public is Black Watch (also known as old Campbell, Grant hunting, and Government). This tartan, a dark variant (and ancestor) of the main Clan Campbell tartan, has long been used by military units in the British Army and other Commonwealth forces.

Early manufacturer Wilsons of Bannockburn made many &quot;fashion&quot;, &quot;fancy&quot;, or &quot;national&quot; tartans with catalogue numbers or fanciful names, without any association with particular families, districts, or organisations; two popular ones still in use are both usually called &quot;Caledonia&quot;. Wilsons No. 3 is found in their 1819 &quot;Key Pattern Book&quot; and is comparatively simple, while No. 144 is more complex, though of a similar colour scheme, and seems to date to the late 18th century. (The numbering suggests the other does as well.) Some other tartans in this &quot;Caledonia&quot; group were later claimed by clans; e.g. Caledonia No. 43 or &quot;Kidd&quot; became one of the MacPherson tartans.

In the general fashion industry, various patterns are technically tartan but are not treated as tartan in the clan or district sense. The very basic red-and-black Rob Roy or Robert Roy MacGregor pattern, the oldest of the Clan Gregor setts (though named after Rob Roy in the Victorian period), is also in broad use (often with changed colours) as one of the most common patterns used in flannel cloth for clothing and bedding; in the US, it is often called &quot;buffalo plaid&quot;, a term of uncertain derivation. When the Rob Roy sett is changed to a white ground with any other colour this forms the most common gingham cloth style. Gingham is often given a wider setting, to form a lattice appearance (sometimes called &quot;windowpane plaid&quot; or &quot;windowpane check&quot;). When that pattern is given one or more additional over-check colours, the result is the pattern known as tattersall.

==Tartans for specific purposes==

In addition to clan tartans, many tartan patterns have been developed for individuals, families, districts and towns, institutions, corporations, and events. They have even been created for particular religious and ethnic groups, and for sociological groups like the LGBT community. Tartan has had a long history with the military, and today some military units – particularly those within the Commonwealth – have tartan dress uniforms. 

===Regional===
Many districts, cities, and towns in Scotland have their own tartans, mostly dating to the 20th century (though some few district tartans are quite old), and not always official; many were just created for marketing to tourists, and some are copyrighted works tied to specific vendors. They are intended primarily for those to whom a clan tartan does not seem to apply . At least two local government councils in Scotland have official tartans.
In addition to the traditional district and modern geographic tartans of Scotland, new designs have been created for places in other countries. Only some regional tartans are officially recognised by the government bodies of the places the designs represent.

The pan-Celticism movement has inspired the creation of &quot;national&quot; (in the sense of Celtic nations) and sometimes regional tartans &quot;to emphasise the ... bonds with other Celtic countries&quot; outside of Scotland; none of these appear to have any official recognition. There are tartans of Cornwall, long a part of Devonshire in England (the designs date from 1963 to the 1980s); Wales (from 1967 onward – sometimes with false claims of antiquity by marketers); the Isle of Man (from 1946, many by D. G. Teall of the Scottish Tartans Society, and several asymmetric); Brittany in France (from 2002); Galicia in Spain (from 1990); and especially Ireland (from 1956).

After the discovery of the &quot;Dungiven tartan&quot; and its marketing as a district tartan for Ulster, Scottish weavers (and in two cases English, and in another American) decided to tap an Irish and especially Irish-American market by introducing a profusion of national, province, and county tartans for Ireland and Northern Ireland, generally based on established Scottish tartans with some colour changes. These geographical tartans, which (aside from the Dungiven/Ulster reconstruction of 1956) date to 1970 and later, do not have any official recognition, and are purely a product of the industry. One weaver even introduced a competing set of Irish national and county tartans in 1996, different from the previous offerings. &quot;The influence of native Irish people, either as suppliers or consumers of Irish tartans, would appear to be minimal.&quot;

Further afield, all but two Canadian provinces and territories have official tartans, with the first dating from 1956. Neither Quebec nor Nunavut, Canada&#x27;s newest territory, have formally adopted patterns. Alberta, meanwhile, has two official tartans, including a dress one. All but Quebec&#x27;s were registered with the Court of the Lord Lyon in Scotland. Canada has an official national tartan that was originally designed to commemorate the introduction of its new maple leaf flag, and was made an official national emblem in 2011. Various Canadian regions (like Labrador and Cape Breton Island), counties, municipalities, and institutions also have official tartans.

Tartans have been created for Australia; its capital city, Canberra; each of its states; and some of its local government areas; but only some of those tartans have been officially adopted or recognised by the relevant governments in Australia. US states have official tartans, with the first dating from 1988.

===Hunting, mourning, dress, and dance===

A tartan is sometimes differentiated from another with the same name by a label: &quot;hunting&quot;, &quot;mourning&quot;, &quot;dress&quot;, or &quot;dance&quot;. The first three of these ideas are the result of Victorian fondness for dress etiquette and show (and weaver marketing); the last is more recent.

Hunting tartans tend to be made up of subdued colours, such as dark blues, greens, and browns. Although there is some evidence of early tartans with camouflage colours going back to the 16th century, hunting tartans, despite the name, have very little to do with actual hunting.

Mourning tartans, though quite rare, are associated with death and funerals. They are usually designed using combinations of black and white, or by replacing bright colours such as reds and yellows in a traditional tartan with black, white, or grey.

Dress tartans are usually special tartans for formal-dress occasions (e.g. dress Stewart is distinct from both the main royal Stewart tartan and the hunting Stewart, among several other tartans attributed to Stewart/Stuart). In a few cases, a dress tartan is simply the main tartan of the clan. Dress tartans that do differ from main clan tartans are sometimes entirely different (e.g. MacMillan and MacMillan dress are unrelated designs), while in most cases they are based on the main tartan but with colour differences (e.g. Stewart). Some dress tartans are very modern, but some date back to the era of the &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot;.

Dance tartans, intended for Highland dance outfits, for either sex, are inspired (like most dress tartans before them) by the arisaid ( tartans thought to have been worn by Highland women in the 17th and 18th centuries, which often featured white as a major colour, as do typical dance tartans today (most or all of which date to the 20th century or later). Some dance tartans are named &quot;arisaid&quot; rather than &quot;dance&quot;, e.g. Fraser arisaid.

There has been some confusion between dress and dance tartans, especially since the idea of the latter developed from the former. Most dress tartans, including some of the oldest, also have white in them, and have been used for dance competition in lieu of a dance-specific tartan, so are easy to mistake for dance tartans, which almost invariably have white in them.

===Family and individual===

A large proportion of non-clan tartans in all of the modern tartan databases have always been family tartans, promulgated mostly from the late 20th century for family names that are not clans or listed as septs of clans. These are usually Scottish surnames, but the &quot;Scottish Register of Tartans&quot; (&quot;SRT&quot;) database increasingly includes new family tartans for names that are not Scottish or even British. Most family tartans have no copyright claim, since they are intended for use by anyone with the surname or an extended-family connection. The &quot;SRT&quot; classifies them together with clan tartans in a &quot;clan/family&quot; category if they have history that pre-dates &quot;SRT&quot; or if they are newer and are approved by a legally recognized clan chief or family head, but in a &quot;name&quot; category if they are newer and lack such imprimatur.
A few non-clan family tartans have an older pedigree. The best known is Balmoral tartan, reserved for the British royal family and personal pipers thereof, since its creation by Prince Albert c. 1852. Some clans recognise tartans for specific family branches and septs that are not themselves generally regarded as clans. For example, Clan Robertson/Donnachaidh/Duncan acknowledges separate, established tartans (some of them quite old) for Inches, MacGlashan, MacInroy, MacLagan, MacPhee, MacWilliam, Reid, and Robinson, and they are all registered in the &quot;SRT&quot;.

Since the late 1960s, various weavers have marketed (primarily to Irish Americans) some tartans with Irish family names, without any involvement by family members. There had also been a legend that the rare &quot;Clans Originaux&quot; (1880) contained Irish family tartans, but this was finally disproven in 2003. There is one case of a formal Irish clan/family tartan, however: The Clan Cian Society commissioned a tartan for Cian of Ely, and registered it with the Chief Herald of Ireland in 1983. (Even this has an Irish-American connection, as the chief resided in California, and the society is US-headquartered.) Similarly, a commercial operation in Cardiff named Wales Tartan Centre (supplied by Cambrian Woollen Mill) has since the early 2000s promoted a long series of tartans named for common or prominent Welsh family names; they are unusual in often having odd-numbered thread counts, and having a different warp and weft (producing rectangular rather than square patterns), probably to distinguish them from the Scottish style.

For the much narrower sense of &quot;family&quot;, the &quot;SRT&quot; registers also as &quot;name&quot; tartans those that are created by individuals for only themselves and their immediate-family members, often for weddings; these usually have a copyright claim. One of the earliest tartans named for a specific person is the &quot;Janet Wilson sett&quot;, entered into the late 1770s records of Wilsons of Bannockburn and believed to refer to the company founder&#x27;s wife or daughter-in-law, though made as one of their publicly available patterns.

===Corporate and commercial===
Numerous Scottish brands use tartan, and some have unique tartans. Various not-for-profit organisations also have corporate tartans. Probably the earliest case was that of the Ancient Caledonian Society of London (founded in 1786 and defunct since 1837), which used what is believed to have been a consistent tartan for its members&#x27; frock coats (which, unusually, featured brocade woven into the tartan, of Jacobite white roses – it may be what 1767 advertisements called &quot;flowered tartan&quot;); only one known example of the coat survives.
As an example of a modern commercial tartan, Irn-Bru (introduced in 1901), the best-selling soft drink in Scotland, has its own tartan. Scottish regional airline Loganair uses tartan livery, including on the tails of its planes, and has two registered corporate tartans. &quot;Racing Stewart&quot; is a pattern created in 1995 for the Jackie Stewart Formula One car-racing team.
The &quot;corporate&quot; category is one of the fastest-growing in the official &quot;Scottish Register of Tartans&quot; (&quot;SRT&quot;) database, with a large number of Scottish (and American and other) companies and societies registering organisational tartans. These are generally protected by copyright and sometimes trademark law. These tartans vary in purpose from general corporate livery, to special event tartans, to tartans for fictional characters.

Two examples of the latter are Sanrio&#x27;s 2004 creation of a predominantly pink tartan for Hello Kitty; and the 2011 creation by Disney/Pixar of the DunBroch tartan for the family of the main character, Mérida, of the animated Highland fantasy/adventure film &quot;Brave&quot;.

====Fashion====

An early example of a tartan created by and for the fashion industry, and surely the most famous, is &quot;Burberry check&quot;. It was introduced in the 1920s for the lining of trench coats made by Burberry of London, but has been used for all manner of clothing and accessories since 1967 (with another major marketing push in 2001) and is emblematic of the company and its upscale product line. 

A fast-growing category in the &quot;SRT&quot; is that of &quot;fashion&quot; tartans, created by companies and individual designers simply for aesthetic reasons, without any association with a particular clan, family, region, etc. Like organisational tartans, most of these have a copyright claim attached to them.

A prominent example: In 2017, Scottish fashion designer Charles Jeffrey designed a signature tartan for his Loverboy label, registering it in the &quot;SRT&quot;.

==Regulation==
Manufacture and use of tartan (at least in the Scottish context) is regulated, formally and informally, in three ways: &quot;registration&quot; (recording of a tartan and its association, if any, with a particular family, organisation, person, event, etc.); &quot;legal protection&quot; of a tartan as intellectual property (trademark, copyright); and &quot;etiquette&quot; (socio-cultural norms regarding the use of tartan and Highland dress).

===Registration===

The naming and registration of &quot;official&quot; clan tartans began in 1815, when the Highland Society of London solicited clan tartans from clan chiefs.

Following recognition by a clan chief of a tartan as a clan tartan, the chief was formerly able to petition the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the Scottish heraldic authority, to register it as a formal clan tartan. Once approved by the Lord Lyon, after recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Tartan, the clan tartan was then recorded in the Lyon Court Books. However, leading up to the launch of the Scottish Register of Tartans in 2009 , the office of the Lord Lyon stopped providing this tartan-recording process (though its statutory authority was not changed by the Tartans Bill).

Modern-day tartans can be created and registered by anyone, with the Scottish Register of Tartans. Modern registered tartans include ones for Scottish and other districts, cities, and towns; for Irish counties (devised since the 1990s) and families (for example, the surname Fitzpatrick has two registered tartans); for organisations and companies; and even for specific events or individuals. Tartans are also being created in record numbers among the Scottish diaspora in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc., especially for places, military divisions, pipe bands, and individuals and their immediate families.

Until the late 20th century, instead of a central official tartan registry, independent organisations located in Scotland, Canada, and the United States documented and recorded tartans. In 1963, an organisation called the Scottish Tartans Society (now defunct, and originally named Scottish Tartans Information Centre) was created to record and preserve every known tartan design. The society&#x27;s &quot;Register of All Publicly Known Tartans&quot; (&quot;RAPKT&quot;) contained about 2,700 different designs of tartan. Registration of new designs was not free of charge. The society, however, ran into financial troubles in 2000, and folded.

Former members of that society formed two new Scotland-based entities – the Scottish Tartans Authority (STA, 1996 – before STS closed) and the Scottish Tartans World Register (STWR, 2000 – the trade name of a private company, Tartan Registration Ltd). Both of these organisations initially based their databases on the &quot;RAPKT&quot;. STA&#x27;s database, the &quot;International Tartan Index&quot; (&quot;ITI&quot;) consisted of about 3,500 different tartans (with over 7,000, counting variants) as of 2004. The online &quot;ITI&quot; was later rebranded &quot;The Tartan Ferret&quot;. STWR&#x27;s self-titled &quot;Scottish Tartans World Register&quot; database was made up of about 3,000 different designs as of 2004. Both organisations were registered as Scottish charities and recorded new tartans (free in the case of STA and for a fee in the case of STWR) on request.

In the interim, a jointly Scotland- and US-based organisation, International Association of Tartan Studies and Tartan Educational &amp; Cultural Association (IATS/TECA) emerged in 1984 and published its own &quot;TartanArt&quot; database in the early 1990s as Microsoft Windows software which was much used in the North American kilt-making trade. IATS/TECA was absorbed by STA by 2005.

The Scottish Register of Tartans (SRT) is Scotland&#x27;s official tartan register, and was established in 2009. SRT is maintained and administered by the National Archives of Scotland (NAS), a statutory body based in Edinburgh. The aim of the register is to provide a definitive and accessible resource to promote and preserve tartans. It is also intended to be the definitive source for the registration of new tartans (if they pass criteria for inclusion and a registration fee is paid). The database itself – also named simply &quot;Scottish Register of Tartans&quot;, and sometimes called &quot;TartanRegister&quot; from its domain name – is made up of the pre-existing registers of STA and STWR as they were at the time of SRT&#x27;s launch (preserving the STA&#x27;s and STWR&#x27;s registration numbers, dates, and other details in the SRT data), plus new registrations from 5 February 2009 onward. On the register&#x27;s website, users can register new tartans, search for existing tartans and request their thread counts, and receive notifications of newly registered tartans.

STWR became defunct some time after 2008. STA later closed the &quot;ITI/Tartan Ferret&quot; to new registrations, and in late 2022 removed the search feature from the STA website (pending a site redesign), deferring to the Scottish Register of Tartans, which now appears to be the only operating tartan registry. STA continues offline work on the &quot;ITI&quot; database, correcting errors, importing new &quot;SRT&quot; additions, and recording historical patterns newly discovered in museum holdings, etc.

===Legal protection===
Some modern tartans are protected by trademark law, and the trademark proprietor can, in certain circumstances, prevent others from selling that tartan. An example is the &quot;Burberry check&quot; of the English fashion house, an instantly recognisable tartan that is very well known around the world.

Unlike trademark registration and copyright registration, the Scottish Register of Tartans (SRT) and its authorising Tartans Bill do not create any new or enhanced intellectual property rights through the act of registration (nor provide any enforcement mechanism other than removal of infringing entries from the registry).

SRT, however, permits registrants optionally to assert and record copyright and/or trademark claims over their new tartans, for designs that are eligible for such protection under other established law (such as the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988; and the Scotland Act 1998, which took over copyright and trademark registration and enforcement in Scotland) and lists such tartans as restricted. An SRT registration &quot;provides evidence of the existence and date of [the] design&quot;, which helps establish the copyright date under the Berne Copyright Convention. Such legal protections apply only to comparatively recently created tartans; old clan, regimental, and district tartans are outside the protection periods of such intellectual property laws.

SRT also permits the listing of intended restriction preferences, but has no enforcement capability, and also includes a statement that &quot;No other rights can be conferred.&quot; British tartan weavers, such as Lochcarron and D. C. Dalgliesh, generally will not produce material in an SRT &quot;restricted&quot; tartan without written evidence of permission from the copyright/trademark claimant. In additional furtherance of intellectual property concerns, the SRT also refuses to register a new tartan that is confusingly similar to any existing one (as determined by an SRT review process).

The application of copyright law to tartans is not well tested. The leading British legal case on textile copyright, concerned with designs printed on fabric, is &quot;Designer Guild Ltd v Russell Williams (Textiles) Ltd&quot; (2000), finding for fairly broad copyright protection in textile works that involve creative originality. In 2008, two tartan pattern copyright holders, Rosemary Nicolson Samios and weaver Lochcarron of Scotland, took legal action for infringement of an Isle of Skye district sett (designed 1993) and the Princess Diana Memorial sett (designed 1997), respectively, against the Gold Brothers firm of Surinder, Galab, Malap, and Dildar Singh, who operate dozens of stores in Scotland and online that sell primarily Chinese-made tartan objects or &quot;tartan-&quot;, including cheap Highland-dress outfits, for the tourist market. The Isle of Skye tartan was considerably profitable for Samios, after the pattern was popularised by Queen Elizabeth II wearing it in 1999. The Princess Diana sett was designed by Alistair Buchan of Lochcanrron and of the Scottish Tartans Authority as a charity fundraiser. A British court on 2 July 2008 issued an interim interdict (preliminary injunction) against Gold Brothers&#x27; sale of Isle of Skye goods, after a police search found hundreds of metres of the pattern in Chinese-made cloth in the company&#x27;s warehouse. Both cases may have been settled out-of-court because published news regarding them ceases in 2008. A more recent case, &quot;Abraham Moon &amp; Sons Ltd v. Thornber &amp; Others&quot; (2012), actually involved tartan. It held that the textual &quot;ticket stamp&quot; (a detailed set of weaving instructions, i.e. a thread count with additional information on precise colours, etc.) used to produce a tartan designed in-house by the claimant had been infringed, was protected as a literary work, and constituted a &quot;recording&quot; of the graphical work of the tartan and thus was independently protected as a work of artistic craftsmanship. the decision was being appealed, as it conflicted with previous caselaw, e.g. &quot;Hensher v Restawile&quot; (1976), holding such instructions to be uncopyrightable.

While tartan arguably could be classified as a form of intangible cultural heritage, and its value to identifying Scottish products both in Scotland and internationally has been recognised and exploited for a long time, tartan is not protected by either geographical indication (protected designation of origin) law, nor legislation specific to that kind of product. Harris tweed, another textile associated more narrowly with Scotland, does have such protection. In 1998, Keith Lumsden, research officer of the Scottish Tartans Society, proposed that the word &quot;tartan&quot; be prohibited for use to market a textile, unless the design was accepted in an official governmental tartan registry (which did not then exist). When the Scottish Parliament finally authorised the Scottish Register of Tartans in 2008, it did not include anything like this sort of trade protection. According to Michael B. Paterson (2001): &quot;No mechanism exists to protect [traditional Scottish] tartan from &#x27;misuse&#x27; by interests having nothing to do with Scotland or Scotland&#x27;s interests&quot;, though the tartan registries &quot;play an important, if weak, role in asserting Scotland&#x27;s cultural rights in relation to tartan.&quot;

===Etiquette===
Since the Victorian era, authorities on tartan have claimed that there is an etiquette to wearing tartan, specifically tartan attributed to clans or families. In the same line of opinion, some tartans attributed to the British royal family have been claimed to be &quot;off limits&quot; to non-royalty. Even so, there are no laws or universally accepted rules on who can or cannot wear a particular tartan. (Some writers have nevertheless asserted their existence anyway, e.g. Alexander Campbell in 1890, regarding different Campbell tartans.) The concept of the entitlement to certain tartans has led to the term &quot;universal tartan&quot;, or &quot;free tartan&quot;, which describes tartan which can be worn by anyone without controversy. Traditional examples of such are the Black Watch, Caledonia, hunting Stewart, and Jacobite tartans, shepherds&#x27; check, and district tartans. The published marketing of tartans for simple fashion purposes without any association to a place or body dates back to at least 1745, and much of Wilsons&#x27; output through the 19th century consisted of &quot;fancy&quot; patterns for the general public. Some recently created designs intended for everyone (though some are exclusive to particular weavers or Highland-dress outfitters) have names including Braveheart, Clansman, European Union, Highlander, Independence, Pride of Scotland, Rainbow, Scotland 2000, Scotland the Brave, Scottish National, Scottish Parliament, Spirit of Scotland, Stone of Destiny, and Twenty First Century.

Books on Scottish clans list guidelines, but are not always in agreement. One such opinion is that people not bearing a clan surname, or surname claimed as a sept of a clan, should not wear the tartan of their mother&#x27;s clan. This opinion is reinforced by the fact that in the Scottish clan system, the Lord Lyon states that membership to a clan technically passes through the surname. This means that children who bear their father&#x27;s surname belong to the father&#x27;s clan (if any), and that children who bear their mother&#x27;s surname (her maiden name) belong to their mother&#x27;s clan (if any). Also, the Lord Lyon states that a clan tartan should only be worn by those who profess allegiance to that clan&#x27;s chief.

Some clan societies even claim that certain tartans are the personal property of a chief or chieftain, and in some cases they allow or deny their clansfolk &quot;permission&quot; to wear that tartan. According to the Scottish Tartans Authority – which is an establishment of the Scottish tartan industry – the Balmoral tartan should not be worn by anyone who is not part of the British royal family. Even so, some weavers outside of the United Kingdom ignore the &quot;longstanding convention&quot; of the British royal family&#x27;s &quot;right&quot; to this tartan. The society also claims that non-royals who wear this tartan are treated with &quot;great disdain&quot; by the Scottish tartan industry.

Generally, a more liberal attitude had been taken by those in the business of selling tartan, holding that anyone may wear any tartan they like. Under the liberal view, claimed &quot;rules&quot; are mere conventions (some of which are recent creations), with different levels of importance depending on the symbolic meaning of the tartan on some particular occasion.

The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs has also taken a fairly flexible position (organisationally; some specific individual chiefs may have a narrower or looser take, and not all chiefs are members). Aside from opposing the creation of a new tartan using a clan&#x27;s name without the chief&#x27;s permission, their website states (adopting more loosely some ideas from the Lord Lyon view):
Some Highland-dress historians have taken a dim view of regulatory intents and proclamations with regard to tartans; Scottish National Portrait Gallery curator A. E. Haswell Miller wrote that &quot;to claim special entitlement to a tartan in the same manner as heraldic arms is certainly absurd&quot;, because evidence suggests that the idea was just invented by writers of the late 18th to mid-19th centuries. Sir Thomas Dick Lauder expressed similar views as far back as 1829, right in the middle of the &quot;clan tartanry&quot; rush, dismissing both the then-new adoption of &quot;official&quot; clan tartans and attempts by clans to claim regimental ones.

==In other cultures==
While tartan has been most closely associated with Scotland, and dating back to the Roman period was perhaps associated with Northwestern Europe in general, it is likely that the idea of using patterns of rectangles and lines has independently occurred many times, in any cultures with weaving. Basic tartan &quot;is almost as primitive a weave as it is possible to make ... probably the earliest form of patterened fabric anywhere.&quot; Surviving pre-modern historical examples seem sparse, however.

Modern tartan-style cloth in a wide variety of materials and patterns from simple to complex is available and used today around the world, often simply as a style of cloth and without any association with Scotland.

===Africa===
====Maasai &quot;shúkà&quot;====


Among the Maasai people of Kenya and Tanzania, the is a cotton blanket-like garment (what Scots would call a plaid) worn as a wrap, and very commonly in a tartan pattern, though sometimes linearly striped or of one colour. are predominantly red, though sometimes seen in blue and other colours.
 were originally of painted (typically red) leather, but Maasai have had access to plain-weave cotton fabric for some time, imported to the region by Americans since the 1860s. Joseph Thomas Last, a British missionary, in 1883 described the Maasai as particularly fond of red and white cloth, to be worn by higher-status men (though he did not mention tartan in particular); a 1903 report also had them typically wearing red blanket-like garments, after a time of favouring blue. The Maasai were loosely allied with the British, 1895–1904, and the latter made heavy use of Scottish regiments in African conflicts, bringing tartan with them. However, &quot;Guinea cloth&quot; (mostly produced in India), sometimes red and blue checked, was a common commodity in 18th-century western Africa, pre-dating British West Africa; whether it relates at all to is unknown. patterns usually lack the thin black lines common in Scottish tartans.

A nomadic cattle-pastoralist culture, without their own weaving tradition, the Maasai have been described as unusually culturally conservative and resistant to modernisation. Nevertheless, they have always engaged in trade to get goods they do not make themselves, and have made local traditional use of modern materials. The Maasai approach has been to resist yet assimilate colonial and post-colonial influences.

Although there is evidence of tartan usage among the Maasai to at least the period 1906–1918, when Walther Dobbertin photographed a tartan in what was then German East Africa, the current bright tartan and striped style of appears to have been adopted primarily in the 1960s (partly in response to national-level clothing modernisation pressure), supplanting leather but keeping the same form-factor. The shift in outward form without affecting function led one writer to quip that Maasai dress &quot;has undergone dramatic changes while not changing at all&quot;. Tartan-patterned cloth is not typically used for other Maasai garments besides .

The has become so emblematic of the Maasai that there is some discussion (driven by the Maasai themselves) at the national and regional level about protecting it as a form of cultural property. While it has been claimed that patterns, at least at one time, conveyed particular meanings, and there historically have long been weaving operations in various African areas, most today that are not mass-manufactured in Dar es Salaam actually come from China, not Africa.

===East and South Asia===
The earliest-discovered tartan fabric in the world was discovered in Western China, in the context of the Tarim mummies, dated to c. 2100 BC through the first centuries BC . Today, tartan is still woven in China, both as a traditional fabric and in large commercial quantities for export.
====Bhutanese &quot;mathra&quot;====
In Bhutan, traditional men&#x27;s robes () and knee-stockings (, similar to argyle socks), and women&#x27;s dresses () are traditional national costume styles that are largely mandatory for public dress since 1963. Tartan (generally called or, after the district of its primary production, , among other names for specific patterns) is among the many common textile styles for these garments, some much more elaborate (generally called ) than tartan. The tartan cloths are woven traditionally in yak and sheep wool, but today also in cotton and raw silk.
 is woven primarily with a red ground. Some specific tartan/plaid styles of Bhutan are: broad-checked ; narrow-checked ; (&#x27;golden pattern&#x27;), an orange or rust ground with yellow and sometimes black checks (with black, it is more specifically called , and without, ); red, blue, and black patterns on a white ground, in at least four varieties called (specifically red and black on white), , and other names; and another style is named . Some of these fabrics feature supplementary weft decorative patterns (flowers, etc.) added to the tartan, with an embroidered or brocaded appearance, generally called (&#x27;new pattern&#x27;); one such style is more specifically called , the yellow-orange pattern with flowers added. There are also patterns of simple linear stripes that do not cross each other (generally called or ), with various names for specific styles.

====Indian &quot;madras&quot;====
Madras is a patterened, light-weight, breatheable, cotton cloth named for the Madras (now Chennai) area of India. Traditional madras is hand-woven from lumpy, carded-cotton thread, and coloured with natural dyes which may bleed together upon washing to create a more muted pattern than typical tartan, as well as a rougher texture. Madras also has a &quot;softer&quot; look because it typically lacks the black lines found in most Scottish tartans. Madras cloth dates to at least the 16th century, produced in a variety of patterns, including religious designs and floral prints. It is unclear if tartan patterns were among the original designs, though they became very popular later. Weaving, primarily for export, in Madras/Chennai became a large-scale commercial enterprise after the British East India Company came to control the area in the mid-17th century. Major production of this style of cloth also took place in Cambay State (present-day Gujarat).

Madras, ideal for warm-weather wear, became popular in the Philippines (where it is known as &quot;cambaya&quot;) and the Caribbean; mainly in undyed form, it was also exported to Europe. Tartan madras reached America by 1718, and appeared in the 1897 Sears catalogue. It was popular in the United States in the 1930s and again in the 1960s, often associated with preppy style. Substantial export of the cloth to South Africa began in 1958.

Modern madras cloth is commonly in tartan patterns, but also simply striped (seersucker). Unlike Scottish-style tartan, madras is not woven in 2/2 twill pattern, but is a muslin of plain weave; it thus, when viewed up close, features a &quot;pepper and salt&quot; colour mixture where colours cross (a dot matrix, technically), not staggered diagonal lines . It also usually lacks black lines.

====Japanese &quot;kōshi&quot;====
In Japan, tartan patterns called (also or , literally
&#x27;lattice&#x27;) or date back to at least the 18th century, possibly the 17th in the Edo period (1603–1867), and were popular for theatrical costuming, which inspired general public use by both sexes, for the (precursor of the ),
the , and other garments. The name is a reference to the details of room dividers, the grid pattern said to stand for strength, with larger stripes representing more power.
 range from simple checked patterns to complex multi-colour weaves. Ikat thread-dyeing techniques were sometimes employed before the weaving, such that a colour in the pattern was mottled, and parts of the design may sometimes have been embroidered, supplementary-woven, or dyed-over for additional highlight or contrast. Some styles have particular names, such as (&#x27;three-striped lattice&#x27;) and (&#x27;forked lattice&#x27;). A pattern with larger squares is more generally called or with smaller squares .

It is unclear whether there was a Scottish tartan influence on the development of . The Edo period pre-dates the Perry Expedition of 1853–1854 and its opening of Japan to general Western trade, but mostly post-dates early European contact from 1543 to the closure of Japan to outsiders in 1639 under the isolationist policy.

Nothing suggests that particular patterns have been associated with specific families or Japanese clans.

Today, is the general Japanese word for &#x27;tartan/plaid, checked pattern&#x27;. Tartan is popular in present-day Japan, both for high fashion and for streetwear, as well as school uniforms. Since the 1960s, the Japanese department store chain Isetan has used an emblematic tartan as a marketing tool (e.g. on all its shopping bags); the pattern is based on some MacMillan tartans. Japan hosted a major museum exhibit about tartan in 2018.

===Eastern Europe to Western Asia===
Tartan-style patterns are common throughout Southeastern Europe.

John Francis Campbell (1862) described the native weaving of the Sámi (Lapps) of northern Europe as being hand-loom tartan.

Considerably to the southeast, the Tatars and Chuvash, Turkic peoples of Tatarstan and Chuvashia, respectively, in the Russian Federation, have worn tartan, striped, and other patterns since at least the 19th century.

====Russian &quot;shotlandka&quot;====

Robert Jamieson, writing in 1818 as editor of Edmund Burt&#x27;s 1727–37 &quot;Letters of a Gentleman in the North of Scotland&quot;, said that in his era, married women of the north-western provinces of Russia wore tartan plaids &quot;of massy silk, richly varied, with broad cross-bars of gold and silver tissue&quot;. This seems quite distinct from Scottish-style construction.
The Russian poet Alexander Pushkin (1799–1837), who was influenced by the romantic-Highlands writings of Walter Scott, posed for one of the most famous paintings in Russia, the 1827 portrait by Orest Kiprensky. Pushkin wears what looks at first like a Scottish-style tartan shoulder plaid, but is more probably a sleeveless &quot;Almaviva&quot; cape/cloak, a style in fashion at the time and known to have been worn by Pushkin.

Tartan was commented on in the &quot;Moscow Telegraph&quot; in 1826 as being in broad fashion in the city for all sorts of garments (often as a decorative accent). Scottish-style plaids apparently did come into some fashion in Russia as women&#x27;s wear for a space during the mid-to-late 19th century, a style picked up from stage productions; some 19th century Russian paintings illustrate use of plaids as shawls. Tartan (and plain-striped) shawls were also common among the Volga Germans and Bessarabia Germans in Russia; a mixture of hand-woven (originally as bedclothes and other household goods) and mass-produced in Russia, the shawls became emblematic of the German-from-Russia diaspora in North and South America from the nineteenth century to the mid-20th.

Around the end of the 19th century, the Russian equivalent of Regency and Victorian British tartanware objects, such as decorative Fedoskino boxes with tartan accents in a style called (literally &#x27;Scotlandish&#x27;), were produced by companies like the Lukutin Manufactory on the outskirts of Moscow.

Today, or are simply Russian words for &#x27;tartan/plaid&#x27; generally.

===Oceania===
====Adoption by the Māori====
Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, the first Māori king, adopted a particular house tartan with design elements symbolizing his ancestry, such as inner stripes representing migration canoes that first arrived in Aotearoa New Zealand; this tartan was presented by his descendant Tūheitia Paki to Charles III in the former&#x27;s visit to Buckingham Palace in May 2023. His following tribes concentrated around Northland have also adopted green tartans.

<text>Gravelines ( , ; ) is a commune in the Nord department in Northern France. It lies at the mouth of the river Aa southwest of Dunkirk. It was formed in the 12th century around the mouth of a canal built to connect Saint-Omer with the sea. As it was on the western borders of Spanish territory in Flanders it became heavily fortified, some of which remains.

There is a market in the town square (Place Charles Valentin) on Fridays. The &quot;Arsenal&quot; approached from the town square is home to an extensive and carefully displayed art collection. There are modern bronze statues in the grounds. The town is also home to French basketball club BCM Gravelines.

The Gravelines Belfry is one of 56 belfries of Belgium and France that is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in recognition of its architecture and importance in the history of municipal power in the region.

==History==

In the early 12th century, Saint-Omer was an important port in western Flanders. Silting gradually cut it off from the North Sea, resulting in the construction of a canal to the new coast at what is now Gravelines. The name is derived from the Dutch &quot;Gravenenga&quot;, meaning Count&#x27;s Canal. The new town became heavily fortified as it guarded the western borders of Spanish territory in Flanders.

Gravelines was taken by Henry le Despenser&#x27;s English forces during the Norwich Crusade of 1383 and was that year destroyed on his orders as the English retreated towards Calais.

There was a famous meeting at Gravelines in 1520, between the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and Henry VIII of England. There were two battles fought nearby: the first was a land battle in 1558 resulting in a victory by Spanish forces of Lamoral, Count of Egmont over the French under Marshal Paul des Thermes, while the second was a naval attack using fire ships in 1588 launched by England&#x27;s Royal Navy under Lord Howard against the Spanish Armada at anchor. Gravelines was also the setting for Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s failure to deliver the town from Spanish occupation in July 1586, which is described in the anonymous &quot;A Discourse of the enterprise of Gravelines&quot;.

The town was captured and recaptured several times by the French and Spanish between 1639 and 1658. It was finally annexed to France in the Treaty of the Pyrenees of 1659.

Only in the 19th century did the population become entirely French-speaking.

On 24 May 1940, during the Fall of France, German field marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, commanding Army Group A, ordered his armoured divisions to close up the &quot;Canal Line&quot; of Lens-Gravelines, and halt there.

<text>Trio was a German band formed in the town of Großenkneten in 1979. The band is most known for the 1982 song &quot;Da Da Da&quot; which was a hit in 30 countries worldwide.

== History ==
Trio consisted of Stephan Remmler (b. 1946), lead vocals and keyboards; Gert &quot;Kralle&quot; Krawinkel (1947–2014), guitar and backing vocals; and Peter Behrens (1947–2016), drums and backing vocals.

The band recorded a number of albums, the first of which was &quot;TRIO&quot;, produced by Klaus Voormann and released in 1981. This album included their signature song, &quot;Da Da Da&quot;, the full English title of which is &quot;Da Da Da (I Don&#x27;t Love You, You Don&#x27;t Love Me, Aha Aha Aha)&quot;. The next album was &quot;Bye Bye&quot;, released in 1983. &quot;Bye Bye&quot; was marketed with many different covers; for example, copies in North America were called &quot;TRIO and Error&quot; and featured no artwork.

While Trio was active, in the early 1980s, the group enjoyed some popularity in Germany, UK, Canada, and the United States. The German version of &quot;Da Da Da&quot; was a #2 hit on the charts (April 1982). Their most notable songs, in addition to &quot;Da Da Da&quot;, are &quot;Broken Hearts for You and Me&quot;, &quot;Boom Boom&quot;, &quot;Hearts Are Trump&quot; and &quot;Anna – Letmein Letmeout&quot;. All of these songs, except the first, have a corresponding German version, which sometimes differs considerably in lyrics, and were also released in the English-speaking world. &quot;Da Da Da&quot; hit #2 on the UK Singles Chart in July 1982, and #3 in Canada in December 1982. They had another three top ten hits in Germany until the end of 1983, then disbanded the following year. Every member launched a solo career, with only Remmler managing to be somewhat successful.

They produced a film called &quot;, meaning &quot;Three Against Three&quot;&quot;. In the movie, three people (played by Trio members) kill doubles of themselves as part of a twisted scam to gain riches. The film was a flop; even avid Trio fan Matthias Klein noted that, &quot;[the members of] Trio are not actors&quot;. The corresponding soundtrack is the album &quot;Whats the Password&quot;; however, drummer Peter Behrens did not perform on any of the songs, despite appearing on the album&#x27;s cover. He left the band due to disagreement with Krawinkel and Remmler over financial matters, leading to the complete break-up of Trio in 1986.

The 1997 CD re-issue of &quot;TRIO and Error&quot; was also released as &quot;Da Da Da&quot; in the United States, in response to the U.S. Volkswagen commercial that featured their most famous song. The re-release had some changes: two songs were added and the album was digitally remastered.

Krawinkel died in 2014 and Behrens died in 2016, making Remmler the sole living former member.

=== &quot;Da Da Da&quot; in popular culture ===

Many cover versions of &quot;Da Da Da&quot; have been recorded worldwide in various languages including the Spanish version by disc jockey Nacho Dogan, which was a No. 2 hit in Spain in 1982; a Mexican version by the band Molotov on their 2004 cover album &quot;Con Todo Respeto&quot;; alternative band Elastica on their 1999 album &quot;The Menace&quot;; and Filipino entertainer Yoyoy Villame in 1982. Pett Productions used &quot;Da Da Da&quot; in the second series of &quot;Tittybangbang&quot; for the intro to Pete Wade&#x27;s sketches. An Italian version (&quot;Mundial Da Da Da&quot;) was also released in 1982 to celebrate the Italian Team&#x27;s winning the FIFA World Cup.

In addition to the famous Volkswagen ad, several others have featured &quot;Da Da Da&quot;. A Pepsi ad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup starred several footballers including Thierry Henry, Raúl, Roberto Carlos, Fernando Torres, Frank Lampard, Ronaldinho and David Beckham playing football inside of an Oktoberfest tent. Christina Aguilera sang the tune in several Pepsi spots, including duets with Rain and Elissa. Ariston used the song in their 1987 spots featuring animated white goods, clothing and kitchen utensils forming dancing humanoids. Some ads used modified lyrics. Teletext replaced &quot;da da da&quot; with &quot;blah blah blah&quot;; as did Lois Jeans. Others who have used the tune in advertisements include Vicks Cough Drops, and Speeds shoe stores.

Following the popular Volkswagen commercial, ABC aired a promo for the sitcom &quot;Spin City&quot; parodying the car ad. In the original VW commercial, two men drive around and pick up a smelly couch, which they quickly dispose of. In the ABC ad, Michael J. Fox and Michael Boatman&#x27;s characters pick up Richard Kind&#x27;s character, who becomes so obnoxious that they throw him out of the car.

The rice cracker brand Sakata also used the song in advertisements with the lyrics changed to &quot;sa-ka-ta&quot;.

The song has been used in the Italian film &quot;Il Divo&quot;, directed by Paolo Sorrentino, a fictional biography of Italian politician Giulio Andreotti. The song was also included in the comedy film &quot;Bio-Dome&quot;, directed by Jason Bloom, starring Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin, and in the thriller &quot;Thick as Thieves&quot;, starring Alec Baldwin and Rebecca De Mornay.

In 1988, cover band Weenies On Toothpicks from Clearwater, Florida were playing a warehouse party that quickly got out of hand. But not before they played their version of Trio&#x27;s Boom Boom, a song they covered often in their live sets. Shortly after the song, the party was broken up by the local police.

== Musical style ==
Trio was part of the Neue Deutsche Welle (or NDW); however, the band preferred the name &quot;Neue Deutsche Fröhlichkeit&quot;, which means &quot;New German Cheerfulness&quot;, to describe their music.

Trio&#x27;s main principle was to remove almost all the ornamentation and polish from their songs, and to use the simplest practical structures (most of their songs were three-chord songs). For this reason, many of their songs use only drums, guitar, vocals, and one or two other instruments at most. Bass was used very infrequently until their later songs, and live shows often saw Remmler playing some simple pre-programmed rhythms and melodies on his small Casio VL-1 keyboard while Behrens played his drums with one hand and ate an apple with the other.

== Personnel ==
* Stephan Remmler – lead vocals, keyboards
* Kralle Krawinkel – guitar, backing vocals
* Peter Behrens – drums, backing vocals

The band was produced by Klaus Voormann, who also played bass on a few songs.

<text>Harry Forbes Witherby, MBE, FZS, MBOU (7 October 1873 – 11 December 1943) was a noted British ornithologist, author, publisher and founding editor (in 1907) of the magazine &quot;British Birds&quot;.

==Personal life==
Harry was the second surviving son of Henry Forbes Witherby (1836–1907) of Holmehurst, Burley, Hants, the owner of the legal and maritime stationer Witherby and Co., employing 169 men who retired from the family business in 1899 to focus on his interests in painting and ornithology, leaving it to be run by his sons. After leaving school Witherby entered his old family publishing firm of Witherby, from which he retired in 1936, but resumed work again after the outbreak of the second world war. The family firm of H F and G Witherby, originally printers, began to publish bird books early in the 20th century. From an early age Witherby devoted himself to the study of ornithology, travelling extensively, including visits to Iran, the Kola Peninsula, and the White Nile. He described the latter in his book &quot;Bird Hunting on the White Nile&quot; (1902). He married Lilian Gillson in 1904. Lilian joined him on his travels and even learnt to skin birds on their honeymoon. They had two sons and three daughters.

==Career==
He started one of the world&#x27;s first two bird ringing schemes in 1909 (they merged in the late 1930s), transferring responsibility, in 1937, to the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), who continue to run it. Witherby was Hon Secretary and Treasurer (1904–14), and Chairman (1924–27) of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Club (1924–1927) and President of the Council of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union (BOU) (1933–1938). In 1933 he was one of eleven people, involved in the appeal that led to the foundation of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), an organisation for the study of birds in the British Isles., becoming a founding member and early vice-chairman. The BTO survived through his financial generosity, not least in donating the proceeds of the sale of his extensive collection of stuffed birds to the British Museum - this is now at the Natural History Museum, Tring.

Witherby&#x27;s crowning glory was &quot;The Handbook of British Birds&quot; (1938–1941). Spanning five volumes, it was reprinted a number of times, the later editions having a few pages devoted to corrections and additions to previous editions, but few of these are of great significance and the main text was left untouched. He was made an Honorary Fellow of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1928 and was awarded the Godman-Salvin Medal by the BOU in 1937. Witherby&#x27;s lark (&quot;Alaemon hamertoni&quot;) was named for him, in 1905, but is now more commonly known as the lesser hoopoe-lark. Two other bird sub-species have been named after him: &quot;Emberiza schoeniclus witherbyi&quot; (common reed bunting) and &quot;Erithacus rubecula witherbyi&quot; (European robin).

During World War I he was a lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. He was mentioned in dispatches and was awarded the Military MBE for his service as an intelligence officer in Dunkirk.

<text>Use Your Illusion I is the third studio album by American hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, released on September 17, 1991, the same day as its counterpart &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s first album to feature drummer Matt Sorum, who replaced Steven Adler following Adler&#x27;s departure in 1990 (although he was featured again on &quot;Civil War&quot;, which appears on &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;), as well as keyboardist Dizzy Reed. Both albums were released in conjunction with the Use Your Illusion Tour. The album debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 685,000 copies in its first week, behind &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;″s first-week sales of 770,000. &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; has sold 5,502,000 units in the United States as of 2010, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Each of the &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums have been certified 7× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1992. 

==Background==
The &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums represent a turning point in the sound of Guns N&#x27; Roses. Although the band did not abandon the aggressive hard-rock sound it had become known for with 1987&#x27;s &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; demonstrated a more diverse sound, incorporating elements of blues, classical music, heavy metal, punk rock, and classic rock and roll. This is exemplified by the use of piano on several tracks by singer Axl Rose and keyboardist Dizzy Reed, as well as on &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;. &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; contains two of the three songs, &quot;November Rain&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, whose videos are considered a trilogy. The third song, &quot;Estranged&quot;, is on &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;.

Another factor in the different sound compared to the band&#x27;s earlier work is the addition of former The Cult drummer Matt Sorum, who replaced Steven Adler. Adler was fired from the group due to heroin addiction. Guitarist Izzy Stradlin said: &quot;Adler&#x27;s sense of swing was the push and pull that give the songs their feel. When that was gone, it was just... unbelievable, weird. Nothing worked. I would have preferred to continue with Steve, but we&#x27;d had two years off and we couldn&#x27;t wait any longer.&quot;

A number of songs on the album were written in the band&#x27;s early days and can be found on a popular bootleg album of early demo tapes known as &quot;The Rumbo Tapes&quot;. &quot;Back Off Bitch&quot;, &quot;Bad Obsession&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (referred to by Rose during the ensuing tour as &#x27;the first song we ever wrote together&#x27;), &quot;November Rain&quot; and &quot;The Garden&quot; are considered part of this group. There is also a cover of Paul McCartney and Wings&#x27; &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;.

Besides the stylistic differences, another new aspect in &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; was longer songs. &quot;November Rain&quot;, an epic ballad, is nearly nine minutes long, and &quot;Coma&quot; is more than 10 minutes. Another change was the presence of tracks sung by other members of the band (even though certain songs from &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; and &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot; featured other members on duet vocals): lead vocals on &quot;Dust N&#x27; Bones&quot;, &quot;You Ain&#x27;t the First&quot; and &quot;Double Talkin&#x27; Jive&quot; are performed by rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin. In addition, &quot;14 Years&quot; and &quot;So Fine&quot; from &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; were sung by Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan, respectively.

The band had some difficulty achieving the final sound, especially during the mixing stages of both albums. According to a 1991 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover story, after mixing 21 tracks with engineer/producer Bob Clearmountain, the band decided to scrap the mixes and start from scratch with engineer Bill Price of Sex Pistols fame. &quot;If Axl liked the mix, Slash didn&#x27;t&quot;, Price recalled, &quot;and if Slash liked it, Axl didn&#x27;t... They still hadn&#x27;t finished the record when their massive 18-month world tour started, so the last half-dozen songs were recorded in random studios across America on days off between gigs.&quot;

Slash has stated that a great deal of the material for the album was written on acoustic guitars in a couple of nights at his house (the Walnut House), after several months of non-productivity.

==Songs==

&quot;Right Next Door to Hell&quot; is a product of discord between Axl and his West Hollywood high-rise neighbor, Gabriella Kantor. Kantor had Rose arrested and sued Rose, claiming he hit her with a wine bottle. He denied the charges and labeled her a &quot;fanatical fan&quot;. The condo was eventually given away in MTV&#x27;s &quot;Evict Axl&quot; contest. Timo Caltia (real name Timo Kaltio), who participated in the writing of this song, is a Finnish guitarist, songwriter and guitar tech who once worked with Hanoi Rocks. He&#x27;d played a chorus riff of the song at his home while Stradlin was visiting.

&quot;Live and Let Die&quot; was released as the second single from the &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; album and the third out of all the &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; singles. A music video was made in November 1991 featuring the band playing live on stage and showing old pictures. The video was also made shortly before Stradlin&#x27;s departure and it was the last video where he appears. It charted at number 20 on the Mainstream rock chart. The song was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance during the 1993 Grammy Awards.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; is a power ballad and two versions were released simultaneously on different albums. The version with the original lyrics is featured on &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot;, while the version with alternate lyrics is the 13th track on &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;. Only the vocal tracks differ, and even then only in the verses; however, in those verses, not only are the words entirely different, but the meter and melody are also slightly different. There is also a third version, officially released only on the single for the song, which was recorded during the &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; sessions in 1986. Rose has stated that the song was written about a girl named Monique Lewis (the face tattooed on his right bicep). She was romantically involved with both Rose and Stradlin at different times.

&quot;Bad Obsession&quot; is about tackling drug abuse and addiction, which had haunted the band since before they had become famous. Michael Monroe, lead singer of the Finnish hard rock band Hanoi Rocks and a big influence on Guns N&#x27; Roses, plays the harmonica and tenor saxophone on the studio version. A live version from the Tokyo Dome was featured on the &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; DVD as song number six and Rose takes a dig at Stradlin by saying &quot;This a song that we wrote about one year before &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; with the help of our friend West Arkeen and some guy that just, I don&#x27;t know, his name just escapes me&quot;, referencing Stradlin.

&quot;Back Off Bitch&quot; was written during the early 1980s by Rose and his childhood friend and future Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate Paul Tobias. The song was later played during Guns N&#x27; Roses concerts before the release of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;. &quot;Back Off Bitch&quot; was written partially about Rose&#x27;s girlfriend, Gina Siler, who moved with him to Los Angeles in 1982, and eventually kicked him out in 1983, due to his anger issues. It was also demoed several times by the band during this period.

At the end of &quot;Double Talkin&#x27; Jive&quot; Slash performs an extended flamenco-style guitar solo. Live performances of this song were stretched from its original three-minute length to more than eight minutes long. The opening line of the song &quot;Found a head and an arm in a garbage can&quot; refers to body parts that were actually discovered by the police in a dumpster in the vicinity of the studio. It is rumored that the body parts found were of porn actor/director/writer Billy London aka William Arnold Newton.

&quot;November Rain&quot; is an epic ballad written by lead singer Axl Rose and released as a single in June 1992. It features a sweeping orchestral backing and is one of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; longest songs. It was the longest song in history to enter the top 10 of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, until it was surpassed by &quot;All Too Well&quot; by Taylor Swift, which reached number one in 2021. Guns N&#x27; Roses performed this song with Elton John on piano at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards.

&quot;Garden of Eden&quot; was written while the band was rehearsing for an extended period of time in Chicago. There is a music video of the song, filmed in one static take (shot through a fish eye lens) which features a close-up of Rose singing into a ribbon microphone with the band playing behind him, whilst keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Teddy Andreadis (who played the harmonica for the band during the &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; Tour) are seen dancing in the far background. There are two versions of the video, both made in 1992. One version has strips of paper flying through the air, and is mostly found on music video sites like Yahoo! Music. The other version has lyrics onscreen, complete with a &quot;follow-the-bouncing-ball&quot;, but with no paper flying around. This is the version that is on the Guns N&#x27; Roses music video compilation &quot;Welcome to the Videos&quot;.

&quot;Dead Horse&quot; starts with an acoustic section, which features a guitar riff written by Rose. The electric guitars soon come in for the heavier section which dominates the song. After the final climactic chorus, the opening section is reprised before ending with an audio effect of the song being fast-forwarded. A music video was also made for this song. 

&quot;Coma&quot; was written by Rose and Slash about their drug overdoses. It is Guns N&#x27; Roses longest song to date. It features hospital sound effects and a real defibrillator.

==Artwork==
Both albums&#x27; covers are the work of Estonian-American artist Mark Kostabi. They consist of detail from Raphael&#x27;s painting &quot;The School of Athens&quot;. The highlighted figure, unlike many of those in the painting, has not been identified with any specific philosopher. The only difference in the artwork between the albums is the color scheme used for each album. &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; uses yellow and red. The original painting was titled by Paul Kostabi as &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; and also became the title of both albums. Both &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums&#x27; liner notes include the message &quot;Fuck You, St. Louis!&quot; amongst the thank you notes, a reference to the Riverport Riot near there at the Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre in July 1991 during the Use Your Illusion Tour.

==Release and reception==
Released at midnight on September 17, 1991, the &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums were among the most anticipated in rock history. Predictions in the industry were of sales reaching the likes of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; and Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, this despite the fact that major stores K-Mart and Walmart refused to stock the albums due to the profanity present. Estimates suggested that over 500,000 copies of the two albums were sold in just two hours. Both albums ultimately underperformed expectations domestically but were still commercially successful, with &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; selling 5,502,000 and both being certified 7× Platinum by the RIAA. &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; debuted below &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; mainly due to the fact that the second album contained the main lead single of the two albums &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;. It was the first time that two albums by one band or artist had entered the US charts at the number one and two spots and Guns N&#x27; Roses became the first to have the top two biggest selling albums on the chart since Jim Croce in 1974. The albums also opened as the top two albums on the charts in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

Reception to &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; was mainly positive, and it is regarded as the heavier-sounding album of the two due in part to the influence of Izzy Stradlin. Critics praised the highlights of the album such as &quot;November Rain&quot; and &quot;Coma&quot;, the closing track, but criticized the amount of filler on the album. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; &quot;so physically assaultive, verbally incendiary and at times downright screwy that it&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s a sister disc out there just like it&quot;. While he expressed reservations about its inflammatory lyrics, Fricke found the album strong on &quot;riffs, hooks and body-slam sonics&quot; and commended Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;anything-worth-doing-is-worth-overdoing spirit&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Edna Gundersen said that it &quot;barely betters&quot; &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;; the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Greg Kot preferred &quot;II&quot;, but still considered &quot;I&quot; &quot;consistently involving&quot;. Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;one-star honorable mention&quot; and named &quot;Don&#x27;t Damn Me&quot; its best track. However, &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Mary Anne Hobbs felt that the &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums contained only five strong songs, with &quot;Double Talkin&#x27; Jive&quot; being the sole highlight from &quot;I&quot;.

Retrospectively, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine opined that &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; suffers from filler and &quot;overblown&quot; production but deemed it a stronger work than &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;, highlighting &quot;November Rain&quot; and &quot;Coma&quot; as &quot;ambitious set pieces... which find Rose fulfilling his ambitions&quot;. In the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Ann Powers deemed &quot;I&quot; &quot;the more propulsive&quot; of the two albums, with the &quot;grandiosity&quot; exemplified by &quot;November Rain&quot; being counterbalanced by Stradlin&#x27;s contributions as well as other songs in the vein of &quot;vintage G n&#x27; R&quot; such as &quot;Back Off Bitch&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked both &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; records jointly at number 41 on its 2010 list of the best albums of the 1990s.

<text>Saku Antero Koivu (; born November 23, 1974) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL). He began his NHL career with the Montreal Canadiens in 1995–96 after three seasons with TPS of the Finnish SM-liiga. Koivu served as the Canadiens&#x27; captain for ten of his 14 years with the club, making his captaincy tenure the longest in the team&#x27;s history, tied with Jean Béliveau. Koivu was the first European player to captain the Canadiens. He also served as captain of the Finnish national men&#x27;s ice hockey team from 1998 to 2010, and was inducted into IIHF Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Playing career==

===TPS (SM-liiga)===
Koivu began his professional ice hockey career playing for TPS in the Finnish SM-liiga, beginning in 1992–93. He posted ten points in his rookie season, including five points in the playoffs, to help TPS to a Kanada-malja championship. After improving to 53 points the following season, he put up a league-high 73 points in 1994–95. In addition to earning the Veli-Pekka Ketola trophy as league scoring champion, Koivu was awarded the Kultainen kypärä award as the players&#x27; choice for the best player and the Lasse Oksanen trophy as league MVP. He went on to record 17 points in 13 post-season games that year to earn the Jari Kurri trophy as playoff MVP and win his second Kanada-malja trophy in three years with TPS.

Koivu would return to the TPS squad during the 2004–05 NHL lockout, scoring eight goals and eight assists in 20 games.

===Montreal Canadiens===
Koivu was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, following his rookie season in the SM-liiga, as their first round selection, 21st overall. After two more seasons with TPS, Koivu moved to North America for the 1995–96 season to join the Canadiens. In his first season, Koivu ranked fourth in scoring amongst NHL rookies with 45 points in 82 games. The following season, he was amongst the NHL leading scorers (13 goals and 25 assists for 38 points) before suffering a knee injury on December 7, 1996, in a game against Chicago Blackhawks. He missed 32 games that season but returned to finish with 56 points in 50 games.

The next two seasons, Koivu continued to miss time with various leg injuries. In each year, however, he managed to play in more than 60 regular season games, scoring 57 and 44 points in 1997–98 and 1998–99 respectively. With the departure of team captain Vincent Damphousse in 1998–99, Koivu was named the 27th captain for the Canadiens on September 30, 1999. He also became the first European-born captain in team history. His first season as captain, however, was cut short due to a dislocated shoulder that took him off the ice for 40 games. Upon returning, he suffered another knee injury, resulting in a shortened 24-game season, in which Koivu recorded 21 points. The next season, in 2000–01, Koivu sat out another 28 games after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, limiting him to 47 points.
After six seasons in the NHL, Koivu was diagnosed with Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma, a non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. on September 6, 2001, and missed nearly the entire 2001–02 season. Koivu was on his way back from Finland with Canadiens teammate Brian Savage, who said he looked pale. He was suffering serious stomach pains and vomiting and went to see the Canadiens&#x27; physician David Mulder, who, after several tests, discovered the cancer. Koivu received large numbers of get-well e-mails and letters from fans and was also in touch with Mario Lemieux and John Cullen; hockey centres who had beaten cancer and made successful returns to the NHL.
Koivu was expected to be out for the season but made a remarkable comeback in time for the last few games. Fans gave Koivu an eight-minute standing ovation when he skated onto the Molson Centre ice for the first time on April 9, 2002, in the team&#x27;s 80th game of the season. Koivu helped the team to gain a playoff spot and they went on to beat the top-seeded Boston Bruins in six games. For his courage and off-ice team leadership while undergoing cancer treatment, he was awarded the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy following the 2002 playoffs. He followed up in 2002–03 by scoring what was then a career-best 71 points (21 goals and 50 assists).

Koivu suffered further knee problems in 2003–04 and was forced to miss 13 games. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he returned to Finland to play for TPS, whose head coach at the time was his father, Jukka Koivu. He was joined in Turku by Canadiens teammate Craig Rivet. When NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Koivu returned to the Canadiens to tally 62 points in 72 games. On April 26, 2006, however, during a home playoff game against the Carolina Hurricanes, Koivu sustained a serious injury to his left eye; Hurricanes forward Justin Williams attempted to lift Koivu&#x27;s stick but instead struck him in the eye. Koivu was rushed to the hospital, where he would remain overnight and for the remainder of the playoffs. He remained out of the lineup for the rest of the series and underwent surgery to repair a detached retina during the off-season.

Koivu has admitted to having lost some degree of peripheral vision out of the injured eye which he will likely never regain. As well, a small cataract developed following the retinal re-attachment surgery that was later successfully removed. He has since opted to wear a larger style of visor than he had previously worn.

Koivu&#x27;s play the next season demonstrated that he could still complement his linemates with seemingly no adverse impact to his performance. He reached the 500-point mark for his NHL career on January 9, 2007, in a game in which the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Atlanta Thrashers 4–2. With 2:47 remaining in regulation, Koivu fed Michael Ryder with a pass across the slot for a power play goal, prompting a standing ovation for Koivu from the sellout crowd of 21,273 in Montreal. He went on to score 22 goals and 53 assists in 81 games, totaling 75 points, to surpass his previous career-high. At the season&#x27;s annual awards banquet, Koivu was announced as the winner of the King Clancy Trophy for his role in the cancer-fighting Saku Koivu Foundation. The Canadiens&#x27; team doctor, Dr. David Mulder, received the award on Koivu&#x27;s behalf as he was not present. Waiting until the end of the season, Koivu underwent further surgery to his eye and also tried a contact lens design to counteract the cataract&#x27;s effects.

Early in the 2007–08 season in October, Koivu was criticized by nationalist lawyer Guy Bertrand for not speaking French in a videotaped pre-game ceremony. Although Koivu is fluent in English, Swedish and Finnish, he speaks limited French and is apprehensive about using it in public. He replied to Bertrand&#x27;s remarks that he is not perfect, and jokingly mentioned that he speaks French to his wife during intimate moments. Koivu introduced his team in the next pre-game video with the phrase &quot;Ici Saku Koivu, voici mon équipe&quot; (&quot;Saku Koivu here, this is my team&quot;). Later that season, in NHL.com&#x27;s March 2008 edition of &quot;Impact! Magazine&quot;, Brian Compton listed the ten best captains of all-time since Steve Yzerman was first named captain of the Detroit Red Wings in 1986; Koivu was included in the article in tenth place, behind the likes of Mark Messier and Mario Lemieux. He finished the season with 56 points. In the subsequent 2008 playoffs, Koivu missed a few games with a broken foot. Nevertheless, he contributed 9 points in 7 games.
On October 18, 2008, Koivu moved up to seventh on the Canadiens&#x27; all-time assists list, surpassing Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard in a game against the Phoenix Coyotes; Koivu netted one and assisted on two from newly acquired linemate Alex Tanguay when the Habs beat Coyotes 4–1. Koivu reached another milestone with his 600th career point the following game against the Florida Panthers on October 20, 2008.

===Anaheim Ducks===
Upon the conclusion of the 2008–09 season, Koivu tied Jean Béliveau as the longest-serving captain in team history, having held the position for ten years. Koivu&#x27;s tenure ended a ten-year period from 1999 to 2009 in which six Canadiens team captains had previously been traded away. Becoming an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, Koivu and the Canadiens parted ways after 14 years, where on July 8, 2009, he signed a one-year, $3.25 million deal with the Anaheim Ducks, playing alongside countryman and fellow NHL veteran Teemu Selänne. Koivu was named an alternate captain of the Ducks alongside Ryan Getzlaf before the 2009–10 season began. He made his Ducks debut on opening night, October 3, 2009, in a 4–1 loss to the San Jose Sharks. Koivu scored his first goal for Anaheim in the next game on October 6, a 4–3 loss to the Minnesota Wild. Koivu&#x27;s goal came on the power play in the second period, assisted by James Wisniewski and Ryan Whitney. He registered his first multi-point game on November 5 in a 4–0 victory over the Nashville Predators.

Following the 2009–10 season in which Koivu registered his seventh straight 50-point season, Koivu re-signed with the Ducks for two more seasons. He continued to serve as an alternate captain for the Ducks alongside Selänne.

On January 22, 2011, during the 2010–11 season, Koivu made his first return to Montreal as a member of the Ducks, and was welcomed by a standing ovation.

On March 12, 2012, Koivu played in his 1,000th career NHL game, a 4–3 overtime loss to the Colorado Avalanche. He re-signed with the Ducks to a one-year contract on July 4, 2013.

On October 24, 2013, Koivu returned to Montreal for a second time as a Duck, and was once again welcomed by a standing ovation in what would be his last game at the Bell Centre. In the 2013–14 season, Koivu appeared in 65 regular season games while recording 29 points (11 goals and 18 assists). On June 19, 2014, the Ducks announced that they would not be offering Koivu a contract for the 2014–15 season, making him a free agent. On September 10, 2014, Koivu announced his retirement from the NHL after 18 seasons in the league.

==International play==

Koivu has represented Finland on several occasions and was the national team&#x27;s captain; he was named successor of long-time captain Timo Jutila after he retired from international play in 1997. Koivu&#x27;s first duty came in 1998 when the 1998 Winter Olympics took place in Nagano. He has held the post ever since, with one exception—for the 2008 IIHF World Championship—when he joined the team in the middle of the tournament. He was offered the captaincy but declined, pleading, &quot;It would only stir things up and the team has already a great captain, Ville Peltonen.&quot;

Koivu won a silver medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics and bronze medals at the 1994, 1998, and 2010 Winter Olympics. He was also on the 2004 World Cup team, which advanced to the final but lost against Canada, thus winning silver.

Koivu&#x27;s most renowned achievement with Finland is as first line centre in the 1995 IIHF World Championship, where the Finns won their first IIHF men&#x27;s gold medal. Koivu played in the first line with Jere Lehtinen and Ville Peltonen, the &quot;Huey, Dewey and Louie&quot; line, who were all selected as tournament all-stars.

Koivu was regularly partnered with Selänne ande Lehtinen in a line if all three were available. The trio has been a key factor to Finland&#x27;s success at many bigger events. The line plays mainly to the excellent chemistry Koivu and Selänne seem to have and this has also affected the NHL; after 1999 World Championships, Selänne said in an interview on a Finnish TV program, &quot;It would be great to play with Saku,&quot; which led to speculation about Koivu being traded to Anaheim. This finally became true a decade later when Koivu signed with Anaheim in July 2009.

On February 23, 2006, Koivu was elected by his fellow Olympic competitors as a member of the Athletes&#x27; Commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

==Personal life==
Koivu was born to Jukka and Tuire Koivu on November 23, 1974, in Turku. His younger brother Mikko is also a former ice hockey player, who played for the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets. Saku Koivu and his wife Hanna have two children, a daughter, Ilona (born 2004) and a son, Aatos (born 2006). Aatos was drafted by the Canadiens in the third round (70th overall) of the 2024 NHL Entry Draft.

In 2008, the Montreal-based band Simple Plan featured Koivu in its video for the song &quot;Save You.&quot; The song was about the battle with cancer of the brother of Simple Plan frontman Pierre Bouvier. Koivu is one of several cancer survivors appearing in the video.

<doc id="349267" wikidata="Q849983" url="?curid=349267" title="Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)">
<text>Broken is the first extended play (EP) and second major release by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. It was released on September 22, 1992, by Nothing, TVT, and Interscope Records. The EP was produced by frontman Trent Reznor and Flood.

The release consists entirely of new material and replaces the synth-pop style of the band&#x27;s 1989 debut album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; with a considerably heavier sound that would act as a precursor to their second album &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; (1994). Its lyrical themes are in line with those of their succeeding work. The record was promoted with music videos for five of the eight songs which were censored due to their violent content, as well as a short film of the same name, which was never officially released, but was later leaked as a bootleg.

&quot;Broken&quot; received positive reviews from critics and reached number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, eventually receiving a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The recording helped to propel Nine Inch Nails into mainstream popularity, and later received two Grammy Awards (both for Best Metal Performance) for the songs &quot;Wish&quot; and &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;.

==Background==

After the commercial and critical success of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; (1989), TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band, pressured Trent Reznor to record a very similar album in the hope that it would have similarly successful singles. Steve Gottlieb, the CEO of TVT Records, was insistent that he would not release anything other than an album very similar to &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;. Reznor demanded his label terminate his contract, due to their restriction of his creative control of the Nine Inch Nails project. They ignored his plea.

Reznor then objected to the label&#x27;s attempted interference with his intellectual property. This much-publicized feud with TVT led Reznor to use a variety of monikers for the production of his next studio release. Reznor later said that he hated TVT, in part due to their classification of Nine Inch Nails as a synth-pop band. He reached a deal with the record label Interscope Records:

We made it very clear we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren&#x27;t ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I&#x27;ve finally got this thing going but it&#x27;s dead. Flood and I had to record &quot;Broken&quot; under a different band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn&#x27;t my doing. I didn&#x27;t know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on. 
==Recording==
By early 1992, Trent Reznor used as a recording studio the location 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, the exact same place where American actress Sharon Tate was murdered by the Manson family in 1969. Reznor renamed the location as &quot;Le Pig&quot; where he setted up a recording studio to record the tracks of &quot;Broken&quot; and Nine Inch Nails&#x27; second studio album &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; (1994). In December 1993, Reznor was confronted by Patti Tate, who asked if he was exploiting her sister&#x27;s death in the house. He responded that was interested in the house as her death happened there. He later made a statement about this encounter during a 1997 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;:

Reznor secretly made &quot;Broken&quot;, which was untitled at the time, under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference. English record producer Flood, who produced &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; and &quot;Terrible Lie&quot;, the first two tracks on &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; (1989), returned to work in 1992 on the EP for &quot;Wish&quot;, &quot;Last&quot; and &quot;Gave Up&quot;. As Reznor explains in retrospect: &quot;&quot;Broken&quot; [...] had a lot of the super-thick chunk sound, and almost every guitar sound on that record was [tapes consisting of] me playing through an old Zoom pedal and then going direct into Digidesign&#x27;s TurboSynth [software in a Macintosh computer]. Then I used a couple of key ingredients to make it [be heard as being] unlike any &#x27;real&#x27; sound.&quot;

The instrumental break of &quot;Physical&quot; (at 3:49) features a half-speed recording of Reznor&#x27;s dog, Maise, barking, and Sean Beavan&#x27;s line, &quot;Ow!...fucker!&quot;, after Maise bit him. Maise was credited with &quot;barks and roars&quot; in the liner notes as a result. After being owned by Reznor for over three years, Maise died after falling from a three-story balcony during the Self Destruct Tour. The record underwent development at six different studios, Hell (New Orleans, Louisiana), Royal Recorders at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, South Beach Studios at Miami, Florida; Village Recorder and A&amp;M Studios at Los Angeles, California, and Le Pig at Beverly Hills, California. The last two studios were later used during the production process for &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; (1994). Tom Baker mastered the EP at Futuredisc. Following this step, Reznor presented the recording to Interscope Records in September 1992, and signed to the record label, making &quot;Broken&quot; Nine Inch Nails&#x27; major label debut.

==Music and lyrics==
Heavier than &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, &quot;Broken&quot; takes influences from industrial metal bands such as Ministry and Godflesh. There are louder mixes and more distortion on every instrument, including John Lennon&#x27;s Mellotron MKII heard most particularly on &quot;Gave Up&quot;. Reznor said he wanted the album to be &quot;an ultra-fast chunk of death&quot; for the listener, something that would &quot;make your ears a little scratchy&quot;. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP&#x27;s sound.

Due to &quot;Broken&quot;&#x27;s themes in most of the tracks, the songs wasn&#x27;t reserved strictly form outside the US; Reznor explained: &quot;&quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; was written from the point of view of someone who felt that the world may suck, but I like myself as a person and I can fight my way out of this bullshit. &quot;Broken&quot; introduced self-loathing, which is not a popular topic with anybody, especially in a song.&quot; The lyrics are a critique on society, the majority of its themes involve angst, control and dependency struggles. The second promotional single from the EP, &quot;Wish&quot;, includes the expletive fuck thrice, used on the lines &quot;Now there&#x27;s nothing more fucked up I could do&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m the one without this soul/I&#x27;m the one with this big fucking hole&quot; and &quot;Gotta listen to your big time hard line bad luck fist fuck.&quot; Clocking at roughly one minute, &quot;Pinion&quot; is one of the shortest Nine Inch Nails songs. It features a series of short, ascending, distorted guitar power chords and a collage of atmospheric loops, including a reversed sample of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s No Game&quot; (which is not credited in the artwork for &quot;Broken&quot;). A portion of this is used as one of the guitar riffs in &quot;Wish&quot;, one of the two promotional singles released from the album. &quot;Help Me I Am in Hell&quot;, another instrumental, ends with another uncredited sample, this time from &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980). There are two bonus songs, which follow 91 silent, one-second tracks (numbered 7 through 97) on most CD copies, but were included as a separate 3&quot; CD or 7&quot; record with early pressings. &quot;Physical&quot; is a cover of the Adam and the Ants song &quot;Physical (You&#x27;re So)&quot;, originally released on the &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; LP. In 1995, Nine Inch Nails performed &quot;Physical&quot; live with Adam Ant for two nights in a row. After Reznor introduced Ant and Marco Pirroni on the second night, Ant proclaimed to the audience, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to be on stage with the best fucking band in the world.&quot; &quot;Suck&quot; was written by Pigface, whose ever-changing lineup once included Reznor. The slower, sparser, radically different original version appeared a year earlier on Pigface&#x27;s &quot;Gub&quot; album.
==Packaging and artwork==
&quot;Broken&quot; was originally packaged in a trifold-out digipak, containing the six tracks on a regular compact disc and an additional three-inch mini CD with the two remaining songs, covers of Adam and the Ants&#x27; &quot;Physical&quot; and Pigface&#x27;s &quot;Suck&quot;. Due to the high cost of producing a two-disc EP, only 250,000 copies were released with the mini CD, subsequently &quot;Broken&quot; was re-released as one CD in October 1992, having the bonus songs heard on tracks 98 and 99 respectively, without any visual notice except for the credits, and tracks 7–97 each containing one second of silence. The cassette release featured tracks 1–6 on side one, with &quot;Physical&quot; and &quot;Suck&quot; appearing at the tail end of side two, after approximately 15 minutes of silence. The United Kingdom vinyl release was pressed onto a one sided 12&quot; that featured the six main tracks. The two bonus cuts were issued on a 7-inch single given away inside the EP in a white die-cut sleeve (an unusual method for packaging an album on the vinyl format).

All copies include the logo of Nothing Records, a first for the works of Reznor, making the EP itself Nothing&#x27;s first release. The vanity record label was founded by Reznor along with John Malm Jr., who was his manager at the time, when he had involvement in a feud with TVT Records. It had a short lifespan (Nothing Records existed for nearly 15 years); the label was created in 1992, as Reznor signed to Interscope before TVT entered into a joint venture with that major record label, where he mailed parts culled from his publishing rights to TVT Music, in exchange for the freedom of having his own imprint.

The influence of Reznor&#x27;s conflict with his former label, TVT, is evident in multiple aspects of the EP. After a long list of credits, the packaging reads, &quot;no thanks: you know who you fucking are&quot; followed by &quot;the slave thinks he is released from bondage only to find a stronger set of chains.&quot; These comments are likely directed towards TVT Records&#x27; Steve Gottlieb, who refused to let Reznor out of his contract, sparking legal battles between the two parties. The &quot;no thanks&quot; part may be a response to the liner notes of Ministry&#x27;s &quot;Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs&quot; album, which featured a cryptic &quot;no thanks, you know who you are.&quot;
Aurally, at the beginning of &quot;Physical&quot;, Reznor whispers, &quot;eat your heart out, Steve.&quot; Visually, in a music video for &quot;Gave Up&quot;, the monitor of a Mac computer running Pro Tools reads &quot;fuck you steve&quot;.

Despite the addition of &quot;no thanks: you know who you fucking are&quot;, there is a &quot;Thank You&quot; section. People listed in that portion include Jimmy Iovine, Ros Earles, Island Records, Eric Greenspan, Rick Rubin, Joe Mcewen, Seymour Stein, Susie Tallman, Mark O&#x27;Shea, Ian Copeland, Kevin Westenberg and Sheroa Rees-Davies.

The writing credit for &quot;Suck&quot; caused a minor controversy. Whereas Pigface albums list all contributors to each of the songs, in this case, &quot;Atkins/Rieflin/Barker/Reznor&quot; as listed on &quot;Gub&quot;, the credit on &quot;Broken&quot; states &quot;written by t. reznor/pigface&quot;. On the later Pigface release &quot;Truth Will Out&quot;, the writing credit for the song is &quot;whatever trent says – really – no shit&quot;. Reznor talked about his problem with Pigface in an unreleased 1992 &quot;Melody Maker&quot; interview. Reznor says he came in at the end of the &quot;Gub&quot; recording session, when time was running out, sang the lyrics for &quot;Suck&quot; over the leftover drum snippets they had, threw it together and said it was done. He stated he does not like the recording. Later, when Pigface were going to go on tour, Reznor taught them the proper music he had written for the song, which is completely different than the music that he sang over on the Pigface studio recording. Pigface toured with the song with Nine Inch Nails, even playing the song with Reznor a few times. (The original Pigface recording is abstract noise and occasional bass over drum beats; nothing like Reznor&#x27;s version.) The following year, Reznor put out his version on &quot;Broken&quot;. In the liner notes, he mentions that there were personality conflicts and people saying they deserve more than they have.

==Release and reception==


&quot;It&#x27;s heavy&quot;, wrote Danny Scott in &quot;Select&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s loud and it&#x27;ll rip your stinkin&#x27; head from your shoulders if you so much as breathe without permission.&quot; &quot;Beats are hammered home with the gleeful force of a dentist&#x27;s drill&quot;, said Peter Kane in &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;while layers of rabid guitars and Reznor&#x27;s spiteful voice pile on the nihilistic agony.&quot; &quot;Reznor has shaken off the shackles of influence&quot;, observed &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;and found his own suitably idiosyncratic niche.&quot; &quot;Like a harrowing rape account&quot;, marveled &quot;Making Music&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s an intensely vicious and shocking 30 minutes.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, J. D. Considine stated: &quot;Harder than Ministry, hookier than Nitzer Ebb, this EP is everything industrial music should be.&quot; &quot;CMJ&quot; described &quot;Broken&quot; as &quot;an astonishingly cold, brutal and bleak EP.&quot;

The EP was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 18, 1992, despite a complete absence of touring in support of it. The first promotional single, &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;, received moderate airplay, but its video&#x27;s depiction of Bob Flanagan being pleasured, tortured, and killed on a device led to MTV banning it outright. This stunted the single&#x27;s growth, but the track &quot;Wish&quot; was much more successful with an aggressive live performance on the music video, then later winning a Grammy for Best Metal Performance. Reznor later quipped that he wanted his gravestone to read &quot;Reznor: Died. Said &#x27;Fist Fuck&#x27;, Won a Grammy.&quot;

==Music videos==

Not long after the EP&#x27;s release, a short horror musical film also named &quot;Broken&quot; was created during and after the production of the EP. It was rumored to be a snuff film with all of its songs with the exception of &quot;Last&quot;, &quot;Physical&quot;, and &quot;Suck&quot; playing to a scene. This film was directed by Peter Christopherson of Throbbing Gristle and Coil fame. A music video for &quot;Gave Up&quot; would prove to be part of the film, as well as the videos for &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; and &quot;Wish&quot;. Portions of &quot;Broken&quot; would, however, be released as part of the &quot;Closure&quot; VHS, which was released after &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. Due to the graphic substance of &quot;Gave Up&quot;, an alternative version of the music video consisting of the song being performed at Le Pig studios by Reznor, a young Marilyn Manson, Richard Patrick and Chris Vrenna was released to MTV. The cast, aside from Bob Flanagan in &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;, and the band itself in &quot;Wish&quot;, is unknown. The film is generally credited to be directed by Christopherson, although the music videos themselves were directed by various other people: &quot;Pinion&quot; and &quot;Help Me I Am in Hell&quot; is credited to Eric Goode and Serge Becker, while &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; is credited to Jon Reiss. The music video for &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; was universally banned, though a few attempts to air it were successful. An episode of &quot;Raw Time&quot; aired &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; at 3:00 AM to unanimously positive response from viewers. Another program, &quot;Music Link&quot;, broadcast the video at midnight.

&quot;Broken&quot; has not been given an official commercial release (according to Reznor, because they wanted to avoid the film overshadowing the prominence of the music), thus adding to its mythological status in alternative culture. The original hand-dubbed tapes were distributed by Reznor to various friends with dropouts at certain points so he could know who distributed any copies that might surface. Reznor, commenting in the &quot;Access&quot; section of the NIN website, implied that Gibby Haynes was responsible for the most prominent leak. This copy was traded on VHS tapes for years (resulting in many poor-quality, high-generation copies), and was later encoded in MPEG and AVI formats and distributed extensively through peer-to-peer networks and Nine Inch Nails fan websites. These are generally not of the highest quality, as they are not first-generation copies.

On December 30, 2006, an unofficial version of the film was released on a DVD disc image and distributed via BitTorrent at The Pirate Bay by the same anonymous user called &quot;seed0&quot; who uploaded the leaked DVD version of &quot;Closure&quot;. The DVD image represents a significant upgrade in visual and audio quality from &quot;Broken 2.0.&quot;, and includes the oft-missing video for &quot;Help Me I Am in Hell&quot;. Fans have speculated that this version of the film has been sourced directly from the master tapes, and that Reznor himself may have been the source of this leak along with the &quot;Closure&quot; DVD leak, as implied by a post on his official blog: &quot;12/21/06 : Happy Holidays! This one is a guilt-free download. (shhhh - I didn&#x27;t say that out loud). If you know what I&#x27;m talking about, cool.&quot;

==Track listing==
Notes

A few variations of &quot;Broken&quot; exist, mostly due to different track listing arrangements:
* The very first US CD pressings of the album had &quot;Physical&quot; and &quot;Suck&quot; included on a second disc, a three-inch mini CD. Many pressings outside the US had no second disc and these songs were tracks 7 and 8 on the main disc. Later American pressings eliminated the second disc as well and included the songs on the main disc as tracks 98 and 99. On this version tracks 7–97 consist of 1 second of silence each resulting in a slightly longer total playtime (33:09 vs. 31:35).
* On most pressings, US and otherwise, tracks 7/98 and 8/99 are not listed in the track listing on the back of the case. Some pressings also omit track 6, &quot;Gave Up&quot; from the rear listing as well.
* The only US 12-inch vinyl pressings released prior to the 2017 Definitive Edition (&quot;promotional&quot; only) omit the two instrumental tracks, &quot;Pinion&quot; and &quot;Help Me I Am in Hell&quot;.
* Unlike the relatively large number of various CD versions, almost all cassette pressings across all regions include tracks 1–6 on side A and tracks 7–8 on side B.
* All vinyl pressings include &quot;Physical&quot; and &quot;Suck&quot; on a separate seven-inch disc.

==Personnel==
* Trent Reznor – writing, performance, production
* Flood – production
* Martin Atkins – drums (2, 8)

<text>José Nicolas Théodore (born September 13, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens, Colorado Avalanche, Washington Capitals, Minnesota Wild, and Florida Panthers.

Théodore played major junior in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), where he won a President&#x27;s Cup as QMJHL champions and competed in the Memorial Cup with the Hull Olympiques in 1995. He won both the Ford Cup as the top defensive player and Guy Lafleur Trophy as playoff MVP in 1995 and is a two-time QMJHL Second Team All-Star. Drafted 44th overall by the Canadiens in 1994, Théodore played eight seasons in Montreal, where he won the Vezina and Hart trophies, both in 2002. In 2006, he was traded to the Colorado Avalanche, where he played two full seasons. Théodore also played two seasons for the Washington Capitals. Internationally, Théodore won a gold medal with Canada at the 1996 World Junior Championships, where he was named the tournament&#x27;s best goaltender. He also started for Canada at the 2001 World Championships and was a backup for the 2004 World Cup.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Théodore played in the 1990 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Richelieu 47 minor ice hockey team.

===QMJHL career (1992–1996)===
Théodore played major junior in the QMJHL for four seasons with the St-Jean Lynx and Hull Olympiques. At age 16, he began his major junior rookie season in 1992–93, splitting goaltending duties with Jean-Pascal Lemelin. He assumed the starting position the following season in 1993–94, recording a 3.61 goals against average (GAA) with a 20–29–6 record. Théodore was drafted that off-season by the Montreal Canadiens 44th overall in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft.

Théodore returned to the Lynx upon his draft in 1994–95, but was traded early in the season to the Hull Olympiques. In 43 games with his new team in the regular season, Théodore posted a 2.97 GAA with a 27-14-1 record to be awarded the Ford Cup as the top defensive player and be named to the QMJHL second All-Star team. Théodore went on to lead the Olympiques to the President&#x27;s Cup as QMJHL champions, winning the Guy Lafleur Trophy as playoff MVP. Earning a berth in the 1995 Memorial Cup, the Olympiques finished in last place in the tournament.

Following the 1995 major junior playoffs, Théodore made his professional debut, being assigned to the American Hockey League (AHL), where he played one game for the Fredericton Canadiens, Montreal&#x27;s minor league affiliate, in the 1995 Calder Cup playoffs.

Théodore played his fourth and final QMJHL season with the Olympiques in 1995–96. Although he was named to his second consecutive second All-Star team, the Olympiques failed to defend their QMJHL title. Théodore was injured and missed the first two rounds of the playoffs. He returned later in the semi-final against les Harfangs de Beauport, who were coached by former Hull Olympiques&#x27; coach Alain Vigneault. The Olympiques were defeated in five games by les Harfangs, which were led by future NHL goaltender Martin Biron. This was redemption for les Harfangs and Biron, who were defeated by Théodore and the Olympiques in five games in the previous post-season, in 1994–95.

===Montreal Canadiens===
Théodore spent his first three seasons with the Montreal Canadiens organization, splitting time in the NHL and the AHL, with Montreal&#x27;s minor league affiliate, the Fredericton Canadiens. He made his Stanley Cup playoffs debut in 1997, winning a 4–3 triple overtime game against the New Jersey Devils, making 56 saves. The following year, he appeared in three playoff games for the Canadiens against the Buffalo Sabres, despite not playing in any regular season games for them that campaign.

===Rise to prominence (1999–2004)===
Théodore became a full-time NHLer in 1999–2000, sharing starts with Jeff Hackett. In his first full NHL season, Théodore posted a 12–13–2 record with a 2.10 GAA and .919 save percentage, along with five shutouts. He assumed the starting role over Hackett the following season in 2000–01 and went 20–29–5 in 59 games. During a game on January 2, 2001, Théodore became the sixth goaltender to directly score a goal when he attempted to clear the puck from the defensive zone against the New York Islanders and scored into the empty net, which was vacated by John Vanbiesbrouck for the extra attacker. He became the first NHL goalie to directly score a goal and record a shutout in the same game, as the Canadiens defeated the Islanders 3–0. But he was the second goaltender to be credited with a goal and a shutout in the same game, after Damian Rhodes, who was credited with a goal in a 6–0 win on January 2, 1999.

Théodore emerged as a world-class goaltender in 2001–02, when he turned in a Vezina- and Hart Memorial Trophy-winning performance with a 30–24–10 record, 2.11 GAA and .931 save percentage. Interestingly, both awards resulted in a tie for first place and both times, the two leading finalists had exactly 70% of the vote. Theodore won both as a result of having more first place votes over Jarome Iginla (Hart) and Patrick Roy (Vezina).

He led the Canadiens into the playoffs as the eighth and final seed in the Eastern Conference, and was a pivotal factor in upsetting the top-ranked Boston Bruins in the first round. He became an immediate fan favorite in the city of Montreal. However, the Canadiens were eliminated by the Carolina Hurricanes the following round in six games.

Théodore was unable to match his previous season&#x27;s performance in 2002–03 and ended the season with significantly lower statistics (2.90 GAA and .909 save percentage) to go with a losing record that saw the Canadiens unable to make the playoffs. He bounced back in 2003–04 with a GAA of 2.27 and save percentage of .919. During the season, he participated with the Canadiens in the 2003 Heritage Classic, the NHL&#x27;s first ever outdoor hockey game. The game was held at Commonwealth Stadium against the Edmonton Oilers, a game which Montreal won 4–3. Playing in sub-zero temperatures, Théodore famously wore a toque over his goalie helmet. He ended the season with a second 30-win campaign, helping the Canadiens qualify for the 2004 playoffs as the seventh seed. They upset the Boston Bruins for the second time in three years in a seven-game opening series, before being eliminated by the top-seeded, eventual Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning in four.

Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Théodore went overseas to play for Djurgårdens IF of the Swedish Elitserien.

When NHL play resumed in 2005–06, it was revealed on February 9, 2006, he had failed a random drug test conducted prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics. The failed test was later revealed to be caused by a prescription hair loss medication Propecia, which Théodore had been taking legally for eight years. Propecia contains the drug finasteride, which can be used as a masking agent for the performance-enhancing drug nandrolone among weight-trainers and bodybuilders, but it is not a performance-enhancing drug in itself. Théodore did not face any punishment from the NHL because he had applied and received approval for a therapeutic use exception. However, he did receive a two-year suspension from international play.
In addition to the drug controversy, Théodore&#x27;s play with the Canadiens was marked by a significant drop and he was being outperformed by backup Cristobal Huet. Consequently, he was traded at the trade deadline to the Colorado Avalanche on March 8, 2006, in exchange for Swiss goaltender David Aebischer.

===Colorado Avalanche===

At the time of the trade, Théodore was on the injured reserve; he strained his Achilles tendon after slipping on the winter ice outside his home. He came off the injured reserve with enough time to play in the last five regular season Avalanche games. His 3.04 GAA with the Avalanche combined with his 3.46 rating earned from his previous play with the Canadiens marked the worst GAA of his career. He was nonetheless designated the starting goalie for the playoffs over Peter Budaj, playing in all nine of Colorado&#x27;s games over the first two rounds before the Avalanche were swept in four games in the second round by the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.

Théodore&#x27;s play did not see much improvement the following season, in 2006–07, as he lost the starting role to Budaj with a 13–15–1 record, 3.26 GAA and .891 save percentage. He saw a resurgence in 2007–08 and resumed the starting role with a 2.40 GAA and .910 save percentage. He was able to lead the Avalanche to the second round of the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs, though they would be dominated by the Detroit Red Wings in a four-game sweep. In 10 games played during the 2008 Playoffs, he recorded a 3.15 goals-against-average. 

===Washington Capitals===

On July 1, 2008, he parted ways with the Avalanche in the off-season and signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Washington Capitals. He replaced long-time Capitals starter Olaf Kölzig and the previous season&#x27;s acquisition (as well as former Canadiens teammate) Cristobal Huet, both having departed in free agency. Joining a team that featured young talents Alexander Semin, Nicklas Bäckström, Mike Green and Alexander Ovechkin, Théodore helped lead the Capitals to a division title and entered the 2009 playoffs as the second seed. However, after allowing four goals in a Game 1 loss to the New York Rangers in the opening round, he was pulled in favour of backup Semyon Varlamov. In 2010, Théodore had a 30–7–7 record and tied a Capitals franchise record for consecutive wins (10) and ended the season on a 20–0–4 streak. He started the playoffs but was pulled in Game 2 and replaced again by Varlamov. Théodore did not play any more games as the Capitals were eliminated in seven games in the first round of playoffs, as Jaroslav Halák and the Montreal Canadiens won three consecutive games to overcome a 3–1 deficit to win the series four games to three. Théodore won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy in 2010.

===Minnesota Wild===

The Minnesota Wild had their backup goaltender, Josh Harding, tear the Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his right knee in a pre-season game away against the St. Louis Blues that forced him to miss the entire 2010–11 season. In need of a netminder the Wild signed Théodore to a one-year, $1.1 million contract to serve as backup to Niklas Bäckström. Théodore had a solid year posting a .916 save percentage and a 2.71 goals against average while winning 15 games, among them his 250th career victory on January 2, 2011, with a 6–5 overtime victory against the Phoenix Coyotes.

===Florida Panthers===

After an impressive year as a backup in Minnesota, Théodore signed a two-year, $3 million contract with the Florida Panthers on July 1, 2011, to replace Tomáš Vokoun as Florida&#x27;s starting goaltender. On December 8, 2011, Théodore played in his 600th regular season NHL game, against the Boston Bruins. He recorded 22 wins during the season, as he helped the Panthers return to the playoffs for the first time since 2000. Despite having home ice advantage in the first round, the Panthers would lose Game 7 to the New Jersey Devils in double overtime, 3–2, with Théodore stopping 33 of 36 shots. He would spend one more year as Florida&#x27;s starter, which was cut short by injury, and then he was not retained by the club in the summer of 2013.

==International play==



Théodore played for Team Canada at the 1996 World Junior Championships in Boston during his fourth major junior season. He posted a 4–0–0 record with a 1.50 GAA to earn Best Goaltender and Tournament All-Star honours, en route to Canada&#x27;s fourth straight gold medal at the tournament.

Théodore made his debut for Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s team in the 2001 World Championship. He recorded two shutouts and a 1.63 GAA, but Canada was defeated in the quarter-finals by the United States. In 2004, he played backup for Team Canada at the World Cup, seeing Canada defeat Finland in the final to capture the championship.

==Personal life==
Théodore&#x27;s father, Theodore (Ted) Théodore, is of Macedonian descent, while his mother is of Spanish descent. On December 15, 2004, his father and half-brother pleaded guilty to charges of loansharking and possession of a restricted weapon. In February 2005, the 71-year-old Ted Théodore was issued a $30,000 fine, but no jail time.

Théodore has one child, Romi (born March 22, 2006), with his wife Stéphanie Cloutier. Cloutier gave birth to their second child, Chace (born prematurely) in the summer of 2009. On August 20, 2009, the Washington Capitals and Théodore&#x27;s sister-in-law reported his two-month-old son, Chace, had died.

Théodore founded Saves for Kids, a charity to benefit the NICU at Children&#x27;s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.

In December 2013, TVA Sports announced Théodore would join the network as an analyst for its NHL coverage beginning in the 2014–15 season. In 2014, he joined the staff of the &quot;Journal de Montréal&quot; as a hockey columnist.

<doc id="349273" wikidata="Q1001818" url="?curid=349273" title="Fixed (EP)">
<text>Fixed is the second extended play (EP) by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. It was released on December 7, 1992, by Nothing, TVT, and Interscope Records. It serves as a companion release to &quot;Broken&quot; (1992), and includes remixes by Coil, Danny Hyde, JG Thirlwell, and Butch Vig, as well as then-live band member Chris Vrenna.

&quot;Fixed&quot; charted in New Zealand and Canada in 1993 and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on March 1, 1995.

==Background and content==
According to Trent Reznor, Nine Inch Nails frontman and, at the time, sole member, &quot;Fixed&quot; was not intended to be a remix album, but instead a reinterpretation and deconstruction of the music found on the 1992 EP &quot;Broken&quot;, where the songs were in their &quot;proper form&quot;.

After Reznor hired Peter Christopherson of Coil to direct the accompanying film to &quot;Broken&quot;, they developed a friendship. Shortly after, Reznor asked Christopherson to contribute to &quot;Fixed&quot;. JG Thirlwell and Butch Vig were also recruited for the remixing effort. Thirwell&#x27;s second &quot;Wish&quot; remix, &quot;Fist Fuck&quot;, features samples of Timothy Leary while the final track, &quot;Screaming Slave&quot;, contains various samples of Bob Flanagan being tortured that were recorded during the filming of the &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; music video. Ultimately, Vig&#x27;s contributions were minimal, relegated to the ending passage of &quot;Throw This Away&quot;. About the experience, Vig said, &quot;I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn&#x27;t fit the EP, so he just used the ending.&quot; Reznor and Chris Vrenna completed many of the remixes in-house.

Musically, &quot;Fixed&quot; is a dark, industrial, and noisy EP. Much of &quot;Broken&quot;&#x27;s heavy metal aspects are eschewed and replaced with more beat- and drum-focused sounds. Tape manipulation, unusual noises, and a focus on grinding repetition define &quot;Fixed&quot; as a distinctly experimental release.

==&quot;Uncoiled&quot; and &quot;Recoiled&quot;==
After Christopherson and John Balance, the two members of Coil who worked on &quot;Fixed&quot;, died, Danny Hyde released a number of outtakes from the remix EP, the &quot;Closer to God&quot; (1994) single, and the &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot; (1995) remix album onto torrent websites. This initial leak was titled &quot;Uncoiled&quot;, and a later semi-official release through Cold Spring was called &quot;Recoiled&quot;. Both of these releases feature alternate mixes of &quot;Gave Up&quot; from &quot;Fixed&quot;.

==Critical reception==
In his review of &quot;Fixed&quot;, AllMusic writer Peter J. D&#x27;Angelo said, &quot;Even though Nine Inch Nails was thrust into the mainstream spotlight, this record shows the group returning to its roots and creating a daring new translation of songs that were pummeling from the start.&quot; D&#x27;Angelo concluded his review by writing that &quot;Fixed&quot; is &quot;an impressive feat and a necessary counterpoint to an important record.&quot;

<doc id="349274" wikidata="Q1474541" url="?curid=349274" title="Further Down the Spiral">
<text>Further Down the Spiral is a remix album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. It is the companion remix disc to the band’s second studio album, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, and was released on May 29, 1995, in two editions, one denoted as &quot;Halo 10&quot; (released in the United States), and the other as &quot;Halo 10 V2&quot; (released in Japan, Australia, and the UK), each containing a different set of tracks.

The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 26, 1996, denoting sales in excess of 500,000 copies in the US. It has since become one of the best selling remix albums of all time. &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot; showed a more varied and experimental point of view to the original and boasted many high-profile remixers and contributors including Aphex Twin, Coil with Danny Hyde, JG Thirlwell, and Rick Rubin with Dave Navarro.

The discs include remixes of &quot;Mr. Self Destruct&quot;, &quot;Piggy&quot;, &quot;Hurt&quot;, &quot;Eraser&quot;, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, &quot;Heresy&quot;, &quot;Reptile&quot;, and &quot;Ruiner&quot;, as well as two original compositions by Aphex Twin.

== Background ==

=== Aphex Twin&#x27;s contributions ===
Aphex Twin&#x27;s two contributions to &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot; are not remixes but rather new works composed specifically for the album. Aphex Twin is the performance moniker of British electronic musician Richard D. James, who was quoted about his various &quot;remixes&quot; as saying &quot;I never heard the originals, I still haven&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t want to either, or my remixes for that matter.&quot; Both tracks would later appear in shortened form on Aphex Twin&#x27;s 2003 compilation &quot;26 Mixes for Cash&quot;. &quot;At the Heart of It All&quot; shares its name with a Coil piece from their 1984 LP &quot;Scatology&quot;.

=== Coil on Reznor&#x27;s remix files ===
In an interview from 1998, Coil describe the manner in which Reznor prepared the multitracks:

John Balance: 
&quot;It&#x27;s good to get something Trent will send you because he&#x27;ll send you a really precise, clean, good sounding master tape where you can take all the sections out and you can rearrange it totally. You get spoiled because such a good clean master comes to you, and you can say &quot;Wow!&quot; and rip it to shreds and do whatever you want.&quot;

Peter Christopherson: 
&quot;I think though, the last things we did for him, we actually got Studio-Vision discs, with everything already laid out. He is very organized by the way.&quot;

=== Charlie Clouser on his process ===
In posts on the Gearslutz forum, former Nine Inch Nails collaborator Charlie Clouser described how he put his contributions together:
Heresy remix = Studiovision triggering 2x NuBus Samplecell-1 8mb cards and 4 audio tracks of Protools-16. 1 track lead vox, 2 tracks gtr fx, 1 track for preachers and misc. Yes, 4 tracks of audio. First SampleCell loaded with drums and stuff, second one loaded with chopped gtr riffs. 8 megs each.

No Xpander. Bit-crushed &quot;pox&quot; arpeggios and distant descending melody from Emax SEHD rack with modwheel filter control. All guitars chopped into riffs and put in samplecells then retriggered from keyboard. Wild pitch fx on guitars by HyperPrism standalone (no plugins in those days). Backwards vocal fx by... it&#x27;s a secret. Outboard filtering on guitars by Arp Solus via MPU-101 and maybe Peavey Spectrum Filter. Lead vox flattened with L1 offline in SD2 (again, no plugins in DAWs back then).

Mixed on Mackie 32x8 with no compressors or outboard eq. Send fx (incl. vox verb and delay) from QuadraVerb+ and maybe DP4. The phasey sound on guitars is either DP4 or else it&#x27;s just an artifact of the HyperPrism pitch fx. Yes, Alesis Quadraverb and a Mackie 8-buss.

&quot;Ruiner&quot; remix? That had a sine-wave portamento sound that was actually &quot;Init Voice&quot; on the original DX-7 put through Arp Solus filter for gating fx. ... I loved that &quot;Init Voice&quot; patch. I wonder who programmed it?

<text>Joseph Bernard André Geoffrion (; February 16, 1931 – March 11, 2006), nicknamed &quot;Boom Boom&quot;, was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and coach. Generally considered one of the innovators of the slapshot, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972 following a 16-year career with the Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League. In 2017 Geoffrion was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Playing career==
Geoffrion was born in Montreal, Quebec, and began playing in the NHL in 1951. He earned the nickname &quot;Boom Boom&quot; for his thundering slapshot (which Geoffrion claimed to have &#x27;invented&#x27; as a youngster ) from sportswriter Charlie Boire of the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; in the late 1940s while playing junior hockey for the Laval Nationale. He was the second player in NHL history to score 50 goals in one season, the first being teammate Maurice Richard. Half the time, he played left-wing on Montreal&#x27;s front line with fellow superstars Richard and Jean Béliveau, helping the Canadiens to six Stanley Cup championships, and at other times was right wing on the No. 2 line. But Geoffrion had a hard time convincing the NHL of his considerable talents; Maurice Richard, Jean Beliveau, Bobby Hull (Chicago Black Hawks) and Gordie Howe (Detroit Red Wings) were so good that they overshadowed him. Even after Geoffrion won the Art Ross Trophy as league scoring champion in 1955, NHL First All-Star honours went to Richard, while Geoffrion only was selected to the second.

However, Geoffrion&#x27;s resulting anger was nothing compared to the Montreal Forum fans when Geoffrion scored one goal while crowd-favourite Richard was suspended, and at the time had led the NHL scoring race. The Wings beat the Canadiens in the final round in seven games that year, exactly the same result of the previous season. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t deliberately &quot;not&quot; score, that isn&#x27;t the point of hockey, Montreal&quot;, complained Geoffrion, but fans regardless kept catcalling and jeering him. &quot;I was so feeling the urge to vomit; I felt terrible&quot;, Geoffrion emotionally admitted. &quot;Even thinking about hockey made me feel bad, man did I want to leave. If it had not been for Jean (Béliveau) and Maurice (Richard) visiting, I would have. Usually, it&#x27;s not too much to expect to be on the First (All-Star) Team when you have more points than anyone else.&quot;

Early in his playing career, he had a reputation for letting his temper get the best of him. One such example occurred late in the second period of a Canadiens&#x27; 3–1 loss to the Rangers at Madison Square Garden on December 20, 1953. With a two-handed swing, Geoffrion&#x27;s stick made contact with the left side of Ron Murphy&#x27;s face, resulting in a broken jaw and concussion. The injuries ended Murphy&#x27;s season. Geoffrion was suspended for the remaining matches between the two teams in that campaign.

In a testament to the rough-and-tumble style of play of that era, Geoffrion broke his nose six times, and received over 400 stitches. In 1958, a training accident severely injured him and his life was saved by emergency surgery. Despite advice from his doctors to stop playing for a season, Geoffrion was on the ice six weeks later to take part in the 1958 Stanley Cup Finals.

Geoffrion first retired in 1964 and became head coach of les As de Québec of the American Hockey League (AHL), but returned two seasons later to play for the New York Rangers. Likely the reason for his first retirement was Béliveau (who was not one of three alternate captains), getting appointed team captain in 1961. This was following the Rocket&#x27;s retirement in 1960 and Doug Harvey&#x27;s trade to the Rangers in 1961 (he only lasted a year with the C). Geoffrion, who &quot;had&quot; had an A, was devastated by the decision to go with Béliveau.

&quot;If I didn&#x27;t keep suffering all those terrible injuries and yet keep coming back, if I weren&#x27;t fit to lead, would I have gotten the C and kept playing?&quot; asked Geoffrion, who had, in the 1961 semifinals, hurt a leg and insisted, even so, that Harvey cut a cast off it so he could play. &quot;Yes, I think I would. There were times when everybody kept telling me to quit. My doctor even told me I should stop playing, but I came back.&quot;

==Coaching career==
In 1968 he finally retired as a player and became coach of the Rangers, but resigned after only 43 games due to ulcers in his stomach. In 1972 he became the first coach of the Atlanta Flames, and held the position for two and a half seasons, leading them to their first playoff appearance in 1974. However, 52 games into his third season, he had to resign due to health problems yet again. Geoffrion moved to the Flames&#x27; broadcast booth, where he became the colour commentator alongside veteran play-by-play man Jiggs McDonald. He realized a longtime dream of coaching his beloved Canadiens in 1979, but his recurring stomach ailment forced him to step down mid-season.

In the 1970s and into the 1980s, Geoffrion appeared in several television commercials for Miller Lite beer, part of their stable of retired athletes-turned-spokesmen which also included Billy Martin and Bob Uecker.

==Family==
Geoffrion was the son of Jean-Baptiste Geoffrion, a restaurant owner, and his wife, Florina Poitras. He grew up in Drolet, a suburb east of Montreal. Geoffrion was a direct descendant of Pierre Joffrion and his wife Marie Priault, early French settlers in the colony of Montreal. Marie Priault was a King&#x27;s Daughter.

Geoffrion&#x27;s widow Marlene is the daughter of fellow Hockey Hall of Famer Howie Morenz and the granddaughter of the sister of the wife of Billy Coutu, the only player banned from the NHL for life. Geoffrion&#x27;s son Dan (born January 24, 1958) played five seasons of professional hockey, which included stops with the Quebec Nordiques of the World Hockey Association in 1978–79, Canadiens in 1979–80 (with his father as coach), and Winnipeg Jets in 1980–81. His grandson Blake Geoffrion (born February 3, 1988) played for the Nashville Predators and Montreal Canadiens in the NHL. Dan&#x27;s younger sons, Sebastian and Brice, played for the University of Alabama in Huntsville Chargers. Geoffrion&#x27;s son-in-law, Hartland Monahan, played in the NHL for several teams in the 1970s, and his grandson Shane Monahan played Major League Baseball for the Seattle Mariners in the late 1990s. He, like several former Atlanta Flames players, remained in Atlanta after their careers ended. He lived in Marietta, GA, until his death.

==Retired number==
The Canadiens announced on October 15, 2005, that Geoffrion&#x27;s uniform number, 5, would be retired on March 11, 2006. On March 8, Geoffrion was diagnosed with stomach cancer after a surgical procedure uncovered it. Doctors attempted to remove the tumour but found that the cancer had spread. Geoffrion died in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 11, the day his jersey number was to be retired.
During his remarks at the pre-game retirement ceremony, Geoffrion&#x27;s son Bob recounted how his parents had once gone to a boxing match at the Montreal Forum and that Geoffrion had told his wife Marlene that his own number would someday hang from the rafters beside that of her father, Howie Morenz. Fulfilling that prophecy, and in further recognition of the special link between the Morenz and Geoffrion families, the two numbers were raised side by side (Morenz&#x27;s banner was lowered halfway and was raised back up to the rafters with Geoffrion&#x27;s banner). Traded to the Montreal Canadiens by the Nashville Predators on February 17, 2012, Blake Geoffrion decided to honor both his grandfather Geoffrion, as well as his great-grandfather Morenz, by wearing #57.

<doc id="349279" wikidata="Q1806113" url="?curid=349279" title="Larry Robinson">
<text>Larry Clark Robinson (born June 2, 1951) is a Canadian former ice hockey coach, executive and player. His coaching career includes head coaching positions with the New Jersey Devils (which he held on two occasions), as well as the Los Angeles Kings. For his play in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Montreal Canadiens and Los Angeles Kings, Robinson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1995. He was also inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2014. In 2017, Robinson was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot;. Larry is the brother of Moe Robinson.

== Playing career ==
Larry Robinson played Junior &#x27;A&#x27; hockey with the Brockville Braves of the CJHL and Major Junior in the Ontario Hockey League with the Kitchener Rangers then turned professional, spending 1971 to 1973 with the Nova Scotia Voyageurs of the American Hockey League before making it to the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens.

Nicknamed &quot;Big Bird&quot; in part for his size (6&#x27;4’’ and 225 pounds), Robinson was a big and strong yet highly mobile defenceman. He played 17 seasons for the Montreal Canadiens and another three seasons for the Los Angeles Kings, until his retirement after the 1991–92 season. He won the James Norris Memorial Trophy twice (1976–77 and 1979–80) as the league&#x27;s most outstanding defenceman and won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the 1978 playoffs. He was named to the league&#x27;s first and second all-star teams three times each. His peak years were 1976–77 to 1980–81, although he had a strong comeback season at age 34 in 1985–86 when he was again named to the second all-star team and scored 82 points, just three shy of his career high of 85 (1976–77). Robinson was a dominant player whose talent and leadership helped lead the Canadiens to six Stanley Cups.

Robinson was a member of Team Canada in the 1976, 1981 and 1984 Canada Cup tournaments and was an international All-Star team selection in the 1981 IIHF World Championships. During his career, he played in ten of the league&#x27;s All-Star games and ended his 20-year career having scored 208 goals, 750 assists and 958 regular-season points as well as 144 points in 227 playoff games, a remarkable achievement for a defenceman. He holds an impressive career plus-minus rating of +730, the NHL career record, including an overwhelming +120 in 1976–77 (second only to Bobby Orr&#x27;s record +124 in 1970–71, and with Orr and Wayne Gretzky (+100 1984–85), is one of only three players to have a plus-minus rating of +100 or greater for a season). He won the Stanley Cup six times with the Canadiens, in 1973, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1986. Together with Nicklas Lidstrom, Robinson holds the NHL record for most consecutive playoff seasons with 20, 17 of them with the Canadiens.

Robinson has been honoured for his playing career. In 1995, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was ranked number 24 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. In 2000, he was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame. On November 19, 2007, the Canadiens retired Robinson&#x27;s No. 19 jersey before a loss against the Ottawa Senators. Larry Robinson&#x27;s name appears on the Stanley Cup ten times, six as a player, three as a coach or assistant coach and once as a scout.

== Coaching career ==
Following his retirement, Robinson was hired as an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils in 1993. After winning the Stanley Cup in 1995 with the Devils, he was hired as head coach of the Los Angeles Kings, the same year he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He left the Los Angeles team at the end of the 1998–99 season and signed on as an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils once again. Named interim head coach of the New Jersey Devils on March 23, 2000, Robinson guided his team to win the 2000 Stanley Cup. With the victory, Robinson became the first interim head coach in NHL history to guide a team to the Stanley Cup. The feat would later be accomplished by Craig Berube in 2019. Robinson recounted to journalist Scott Morrison: 

He stayed on as head coach for the next year and again guided the Devils to the Stanley Cup finals, where they lost against the Colorado Avalanche in seven games.

Robinson was fired during the 2001–02 season, but returned as an assistant coach in February 2002 and just before the 2002–03 season to win his ninth Stanley Cup in 2003.

When Pat Burns suffered a recurrence of cancer, Robinson again assumed the mantle of head coach on July 14, 2005. This stint came to an end on December 19, 2005, when Robinson resigned, citing stress and other health problems.

Robinson returned to the Devils prior to the 2007–08 season as an assistant coach under Brent Sutter. Prior to the 2008–09 season, Robinson left from behind the Devils&#x27; bench to become a special assignment coach between the organization&#x27;s prospects in Lowell, Mass., and the Devils.

Robinson&#x27;s contract ended with the New Jersey Devils in the summer of 2012. He indicated he was interested in becoming an assistant coach with the Montreal Canadiens, however that post was filled with former Hab J.J. Daigneault soon after. Robinson then was appointed an associate coach with the San Jose Sharks on July 10, 2012. On May 23, 2014, the Sharks added director of player development to Robinson&#x27;s role. In 2017, at the end of his five-year contract with the Sharks, Robinson left the organization. He is currently a Senior Consultant to Hockey Operations for the St. Louis Blues.

With the St. Louis Blues defeating the Boston Bruins in the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, Robinson won his tenth Stanley Cup championship.

== Polo and horse racing ==
Robinson was raised on a Marvelville, Ontario farm and as a boy, he grew up with a love of horses. While living in the rural area of Saint-Lazare, Quebec west of Montreal, Robinson became a co-founder with former teammate Steve Shutt, Michael Sinclair-Smith and local veterinarian Dr. Gilbert Hallé of the Montreal Polo Club at Sainte-Marthe, Quebec.

While playing in Los Angeles, Robinson became involved in the sport of thoroughbred horse racing through a partnership with Kings owner Bruce McNall&#x27;s Summa Stable. Among their racing successes, Down Again won the 1990 Monrovia Handicap at Santa Anita Park.

<doc id="349280" wikidata="Q45228" url="?curid=349280" title="March of the Pigs">
<text>&quot;March of the Pigs&quot; is a song by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails from their second studio album, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; (1994). It was released on February 25, 1994 as the album&#x27;s lead single.

==Composition==
&quot;March of the Pigs&quot; has an unusual meter, alternating three bars of time with one bar of to effectively create one long measure of . The song features a techno style bridge in with a vocal melody based on the blues scale that ends with a cheerful piano jingle. This is followed by an unnerving silence before the song repeats itself. The song&#x27;s high energy (analogous to a previous Nine Inch Nails track, &quot;Wish&quot;), segued by two piano breakdowns, has made it a staple of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; live concert performances. It is also one of the band&#x27;s shortest hit songs, clocking in at just under three minutes.

==Music videos==
After abandoning a more elaborate version before filming could be completed, Reznor and the live band assembled for the then-impending Self Destruct Tour (featuring drummer Chris Vrenna, keyboard player James Woolley, guitarist Robin Finck and bassist/guitarist/keyboardist Danny Lohner) regrouped with director Peter Christopherson to film a stripped-down, minimalist music video for the song. The video, released in March 1994, features the band performing the song live in front of a white wall backdrop, with Reznor moving around aggressively, pushing the other band members and their instruments, and repeatedly tossing his microphone away. Throughout the video, stagehands visibly move into the frame to reset the equipment he knocks over, handing Reznor a microphone each time he needs to start singing again after an instrumental section. The bulk of the video appears to be filmed in one long take, with the camera zooming and panning continuously. When Reznor appeared as a guest programmer on the ABC &quot;Rage&quot; TV program, he explained that they just kept playing the song over and over to the point of exhaustion to get the final take. The video uses the live performance audio of the song recorded at the video shoot, rather than synchronizing the footage to the studio-recorded version from the album as most music videos do. This version of the song is also included on the &quot;Closer&quot; cassette single.

Portions of the earlier, uncompleted video are included on the &quot;Closure&quot; DVD disc image file that appeared on file-sharing network The Pirate Bay in December 2006; this file is believed to be a leak of a completed but (so far) officially unreleased deluxe DVD reissue of the band&#x27;s 1997 VHS/laserdisc long form music video &quot;Closure&quot;. In this version of the video, the band performs the song in a red cave-like set with water at their feet, and a person with dwarfism appears.

Live performance videos of &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; are included on each of the band&#x27;s live releases: &quot;Closure&quot;, &quot;And All that Could Have Been&quot;, and &quot;Beside You in Time&quot;.

==The single==
The American &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; CD single contains two mixes of the title track, two remixes of its fellow &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; track &quot;Reptile&quot;, and &quot;A Violet Fluid&quot;, a non-album instrumental track. In the UK, the single was released as a two-disc (each sold separately) CD single, adding a censored radio edit of &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; and &quot;Big Man With a Gun&quot; from &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. The disc art for this single features a curled-up millipede, an image that was later used on the cover of the single &quot;Closer&quot;.

&quot;March of the Pigs&quot; peaked at No. 98 on the Australian ARIA singles chart. It also peaked at No. 59 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 chart, which was the band&#x27;s first appearance on the chart. Thirteen years after its release, the single debuted at No. 9 and peaked at No. 6 on the Canadian Singles Chart.

==Reception==
&quot;March of the Pigs&quot; is widely considered one of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; best songs. In 2020, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song number three and number six, respectively, on their lists of the greatest Nine Inch Nails songs.

==Appearances in other media==
The song was released as a track for the video game &quot;Rock Band&quot; on February 26, 2008 for Xbox 360 and on February 28 for PlayStation 3. It was available as a standalone download or as part of the &#x27;Nine Inch Nails&#x27; song pack (also including &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; and &quot;The Collector&quot;). It was also featured on &quot;Rock Band Track Pack Vol. 1&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and the Wii, alongside the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

In a 1994 episode of &quot;Beavis &amp; Butt-head&quot;, the boys watch the video for &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; and enjoy much of the song except for the piano parts. After Trent Reznor knocks over his microphone at the end of the video, Beavis says, &quot;Thank you very much. We&#x27;re Nine Inch Nails.&quot; somewhat dismissively, with Butt-head adding &quot;Good night.&quot;

In 2024, the song was added to the online video game &quot;Fortnite&quot; through the &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot; game mode and as a purchasable jam track. The game uses an extended studio version of the song, featuring a recorded version of the outro typically played at their live shows.

<text>&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Quercus petraea, commonly known as the sessile oak, Cornish oak, Irish oak or durmast oak, is a species of oak tree native to most of Europe and into Anatolia and Iran. The sessile oak is the national tree of Ireland, and an unofficial emblem in Wales and Cornwall.

== Description ==

The sessile oak is a large deciduous tree up to tall, in the white oak section of the genus (&quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Quercus&quot;) and similar to the pedunculate oak (&quot;Q. robur&quot;), with which it overlaps extensively in range. The leaves are long and broad, evenly lobed with five to six lobes on each side and a petiole. The male flowers are grouped into catkins, produced in the spring. The fruit is an acorn long and broad, which matures in about six months.

=== Comparison with pedunculate oak ===
Significant botanical differences from pedunculate oak (&quot;Q. robur&quot;) include the stalked leaves, and the stalkless (sessile) acorns from which one of its common names is derived. (With the pedunculate oak, it is the acorns which are pedunculate, i.e. on stalks, while the leaves are not.) It occurs in upland areas of altitudes over with higher rainfall and shallow, acidic, sandy soils. Its specific epithet &quot;petraea&quot; means &quot;of rocky places&quot;. &quot;Q. robur&quot;, on the other hand, prefers deeper, richer soils at lower altitude. Fertile hybrids with &quot;Quercus robur&quot; named &quot;Quercus × rosacea&quot; are found wherever the two parent species occur and share or are intermediate in characters between the parents.

Charles Darwin, in Chapter II of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, noted that the sessile and pedunculate oaks had been described as both distinct species and mere varieties depending on the authority consulted.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Quercus petraea&quot; was first described by Heinrich Gottfried von Mattuschka in 1777 as a variety of &quot;Quercus robur&quot;, &quot;Quercus robur&quot; var. &quot;petraea&quot;. It was raised to a full species by Franz Kaspar Lieblein in 1784.

===Subspecies===
, Plants of the World Online accepted five subspecies:
*&quot;Quercus petraea&quot; subsp. &quot;austrotyrrhenica&quot; 
*&quot;Quercus petraea&quot; subsp. &quot;huguetiana&quot; 
*&quot;Quercus petraea&quot; subsp. &quot;petraea&quot;
*&quot;Quercus petraea&quot; subsp. &quot;pinnatiloba&quot; 
*&quot;Quercus petraea&quot; subsp. polycarpa&quot; 

== Diseases and pests ==
* Acute oak decline
* Sudden oak death
* The Welsh oak longhorn beetle (&quot;Pyrrhidium sanguineum&quot;) is named after its host tree; the larvae feed at the bark interface of dead wood.

== Uses ==
Sessile oak is one of the most important species in Europe both economically and ecologically. Oak timber is traditionally used for building, ships and furniture. Today the best woods are used for quality cabinetmaking, veneers and barrel staves. Rougher material is used for fence construction, roof beams and specialist building work. The wood also has antimicrobial properties. It is also a good fuel wood. During autumns with good acorn crops (the mast years), animals are traditionally grazed under the trees to fatten them.

== Pontfadog Oak ==
The Pontfadog Oak, once considered to be the oldest oak tree in the UK, was a sessile oak. This grew near Chirk in North Wales. It was understood to be over 1,200 years old, an age that was due to regular pollarding for much of its life. The hollow trunk had a girth of . It was lost in April 2013 when it blew down in high winds.

<doc id="349282" wikidata="Q777468" url="?curid=349282" title="Aurèle Joliat">
<text>Aurèle Émile &quot;Mighty Atom, Little Giant&quot; Joliat (August 29, 1901 – June 2, 1986) was a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger who played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Montreal Canadiens.

==Playing career==
Joliat was born and raised in Ottawa. He began his organized hockey career in 1916, playing for several Canadian amateur teams in Ottawa and Iroquois Falls, Ontario.

Joliat had signed a contract to play for the Saskatoon Crescents of the Western Canada Hockey League for the 1922–23 season, but his contract rights were traded to the Montreal Canadiens when Crescents&#x27; manager Frederick E. Betts sought to sign aging superstar Newsy Lalonde as a player-coach.

At first, the deal of an unknown for the greatest player in the game was wildly unpopular with Habs fans, but the &quot;Little Giant&quot; proved an immediate success on the ice. The following season, Joliat helped the Canadiens to the Stanley Cup in 1924 over the WCHL&#x27;s Calgary Tigers. He helped the Canadiens win two more cups in 1930 and 1931.

Joliat proved noteworthy as a two-way forward, particularly for the ability to counterattack after a breakup. Despite his lack of size—at 5′7″ and 136 lbs, Joliat was one of the smallest players in the game—he was also notable for a refusal to back off from on-ice confrontations.

His breakout season was 1925, when teamed with Howie Morenz and Billy Boucher, Joliat scored 29 goals to lead the NHL, and his 41 points would be a career high. He would remain an impact scorer for the Habs through the 1938 season, and retired the following year, reportedly devastated by Morenz&#x27;s recent death.

==Retirement==
Joliat finished his career with 270 goals and 460 points in 655 games. At the time of his retirement, Joliat was the NHL career leader in games played, a mark he held until surpassed by Hooley Smith in 1940.

He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947.

In a 1985 Montreal Canadiens Old-Timers game, Joliat skated around the Montreal Forum to a huge ovation as a &quot;special treat&quot; for the fans. Despite falling twice over TV cables on the ice, he quickly stood up and finished his skate, the trademark black cap he wore back in his playing days held in his hand.

Joliat continued to skate along Ottawa&#x27;s Rideau Canal well into his 80s, and died at the age of 84 in 1986 after seeing his beloved Canadiens win their 23rd Stanley Cup earlier that year. He was buried in Notre Dame Cemetery in Ottawa, Ontario.

==Achievements and facts==
* At the time of his retirement, Joliat was third, behind Nels Stewart and his teammate Howie Morenz, for goals scored in NHL history to that date.
* Ranked 65th on &quot;The Hockey News&quot; list of the 100 greatest NHL players of all time.
* Named to the inaugural NHL first All-Star team at left wing in 1931.
* Named a Second Team All-Star in 1932, 1934 and 1935.
* He scored the first documented empty net goal in NHL history. The goal, with twelve seconds to play, sealed the Canadiens&#x27; January 21, 1932, home win against the Toronto Maple Leafs.
* Won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1934.
* Despite playing in an era where seasons totaled no more than 48 games, Joliat remains in ninth place all-time on the Canadiens&#x27; career goal-scoring list and second among left wingers to Steve Shutt.
* Named to the 75th Anniversary All-Time Team by the Canadiens in 1984.
* His number 4 jersey was &quot;co-retired&quot; in 1984, having been previously retired in Jean Béliveau&#x27;s honour, yet no banner for Joliat hangs in the Bell Centre.
* His brother Bobby Joliat also played professional hockey.
* He was a linesman when Maurice Richard played his first NHL game in 1942.
* He was the inspiration for Wilson MacDonald&#x27;s 1935 poem &quot;Monsieur Joliat&quot;.

<doc id="349284" wikidata="Q1141027" url="?curid=349284" title="List of members of the United Nations Security Council">
<text>Membership of the United Nations Security Council is held by the five permanent members and ten elected, non-permanent members.

Being elected requires a two-thirds majority vote from the United Nations General Assembly. Elected members hold their place on the council for a two-year term, with five seats contested in even years and five seats contested in odd years. An outgoing member cannot be immediately re-elected.

Elections usually begin in June for a term starting January 1. Because of the two-thirds majority requirement, it is possible for two evenly matched candidates to deadlock with approximately half the vote each, sometimes needing weeks of negotiations to resolve.

Non-permanent seats are distributed geographically, with a certain number of seats allocated to each of the five United Nations Regional Groups.

== Current membership ==
;Permanent members
;Non-permanent members
== Regional Groups ==
The ten non-permanent seats have the following distribution:
* African Group: 3 members
* Asia-Pacific Group: 2 members
* Eastern European Group: 1 member
* Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC): 2 members
* Western European and Others Group (WEOG): 2 members

In addition, one of the five African/Asian seats is an Arab country, alternating between the two groups. This rule was added in 1967 for it to be applied beginning with 1968.

;Electoral timetable

* The representative of Arab nations alternates between these two spaces.

The odd/even distribution was effectively decided by the January 1946 and 1965 elections (the first ever election, and the first election after the expansion of seats). For each of the six and four members in the newly created seats, the UN General Assembly voted to grant either a 1-year or 2-year term.

== Previous Security Council composition ==
From 1946 to 1965, the Security Council had six non-permanent members. Due to a lack of African and Asian member states, the seats had the following distribution:
* Latin America: 2 members
* Commonwealth of Nations: 1 member
* Eastern Europe: 1 member
* Middle East: 1 member
* Western Europe: 1 member

As decolonization increased the number of Asian and African member states without a group, they began to contest other seats: Ivory Coast substituted a member of the Commonwealth in 1964–1965, the Eastern European seat regularly included Asian countries from 1956, Liberia took the place of a Western European country in 1961, and Mali successfully contested the Middle Eastern seat in December 1964 (the Security Council would be expanded before Mali&#x27;s term began).

An amendment to the UN Charter ratified in 1965 increased the number of non-permanent seats to 10, and the Regional Groups were formalized. The amendment effectively created three African seats and one Asian seat (if treating the Commonwealth seat as a WEOG seat and the Middle Eastern seat as an Asian seat).

== Membership by year ==
=== Permanent ===
=== Non-permanent (1946–1965) ===
=== Non-permanent (1966–present) ===
The African Union uses an internal rotation system to distribute seats based on its subregions:
* 1 odd-year seat alternates between Eastern Africa and Southern Africa (only Eastern Africa prior to the creation of the Southern Africa subregion in 1979)
* 1 even-year seat is allocated to Western Africa
* 1 even-year seat alternates between Northern Africa (the Arab nation seat) and Central Africa (with one exception at the beginning in 1966)

Aside from the Asia-Pacific Group also allocating an Arab nation seat every four years (in even years not divisible by 4), other regional groups do not have their own subregional rotation systems. The Arab nation seat is starred below.

The Western European and Others Group in part contains three caucusing subgroups (Benelux, the Nordic countries, and CANZ), whose candidates informally coordinate with each other. While this has not resulted in a stable rotation system, it effectively guarantees that both seats will never be occupied by a single subgroup at the same time.

== List by number of years as Security Council member ==
This list contains the 138 United Nations member states so far elected to the United Nations Security Council, including the five permanent members, all listed by number of years each country has so far spent on the UNSC. Of all the members, 6 have so far ceased to exist, leaving the list with 132 modern nations. These, combined with the 61 modern nations that have never been elected to the UNSC to date (see Non-members, below), make up the 193 current members of the UN.

<text>The American University in Cairo (AUC; ) is a private research university in New Cairo, Egypt. The university offers American-style learning programs at undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels, along with a continuing education program.

The AUC student body represents over 50 countries. AUC&#x27;s faculty members, adjunct teaching staff and visiting lecturers are internationally diverse and include academics, business professionals, diplomats, journalists, writers and others from the United States, Egypt and other countries.

AUC holds institutional accreditation from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in the United States and from Egypt&#x27;s National Authority for Quality Assurance and Assessment of Education.

==History==
The American University in Cairo was founded in 1919 by the American Mission in Egypt, a Protestant mission sponsored by the United Presbyterian Church of North America, as an English-language university and preparatory school. University founder Charles A. Watson wanted to establish a western institution for higher education.

AUC was intended as both a preparatory school and a university. The preparatory school opened to 142 students on October 5, 1920, in Khairy Pasha Palace, which was built in the 1860s. The first diplomas issued were junior college-level certificates given to 20 students in 1923.

There were disputes between Watson, who was interested in building the university&#x27;s academic reputation, and United Presbyterian leaders in the United States who sought to return the university to its Christian roots. Four years later, Watson decided that the university could not afford to maintain its original religious ties and that its best hope was the promotion of good moral and ethical behavior.

Originally limited to male students, the university enrolled its first female student in 1928. That same year, the university graduated its first class, with two Bachelor of Arts and one Bachelor of Sciences degrees awarded.

In 1950, AUC added its first graduate programs to its ongoing Bachelor of Arts, bachelor of sciences, graduate diploma, and continuing education programs, and in 1951, phased out the preparatory school program. During the Six-Day War, AUC was seized by the Egyptian government and was placed under control by Egyptian administrators for the next seven years, and most of its American faculty were forced to leave the country. Egypt stopped short of nationalizing the university, which was supported by money owed as repayment of loans made by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The government returned control to American administrators on June 12, 1974, coinciding with a visit to Cairo by U.S. president Richard Nixon. By the mid-1970s, the university offered a broad range of liberal arts and sciences programs. In the following years, the university added bachelors, masters, and diploma programs in engineering, management, computer science, journalism and mass communication and sciences programs, as well as establishing a number of research centers in strategic areas, including business, the social sciences, philanthropy and civic engagement, and science and technology. In the 1950s, the university also changed its name from The American University at Cairo, replacing &quot;at&quot; with &quot;in.&quot;

The American University in Cairo Press was established in 1960. By 2016, it was publishing up to 80 books annually.

In 1978, the university established the Desert Development Center to promote sustainable development in Egypt&#x27;s reclaimed desert areas. The Desert Development Center&#x27;s legacy is being carried forward by the Research Institute for a Sustainable Environment.

Faculty voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in university president Francis J. Ricciardone in February 2019. In a letter to the president, the faculty cited &quot;low morale, complaints about his management style, grievances over contracts and accusations of illegal discrimination&quot; with tensions further increasing when Ricciardone invited U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to give a speech at the university.

On February 11, 2019, the Board of Trustees of the American University in Cairo reaffirmed its continued confidence and unqualified support for President Francis J. Ricciardone. In May 2019, it extended his tenure till June 2024. Ricciardone retired June 2021.

The board of trustees announced their appointment of Ahmad S. Dallal as the university&#x27;s 13th president on June 22, 2021.

==Campus ==
=== Tahrir Square campus ===

AUC was originally established in Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo. The 7.8-acre Tahrir Square campus was developed around the Khairy Pasha Palace. Built in the neo-Mamluk style, the palace inspired an architectural style that has been replicated throughout Cairo. Ewart Hall was established in 1928, named for William Dana Ewart, the father of an American visitor to the campus, who made a gift of $100,000 towards the cost of construction on the condition that she remain anonymous. The structure was designed by A. St. John Diament, abutting the south side of the Palace. The central portion of the building houses an auditorium large enough to seat 1,200, as well as classrooms, offices and exhibition galleries. The school&#x27;s continued growth required additional space, and in 1932, a new building was dedicated to house the School of Oriental Studies. East of Ewart Hall, the building featured Oriental Hall, an auditorium and reception room built and decorated in an adaptation of traditional styles, yet responsive to the architectural style of its own time.

Over time AUC added more buildings to what has become known as The GrEEK Campus, for a total of five buildings and 250,000 square feet in downtown Cairo. Sadat Metro was developed with access to the campus, and its main lines intersect near there. Also nearby is the Ramses Railway Station. The campus wall on Mohamed Mahmoud Street still has revolutionary graffiti put up. The American University in Cairo made an initiative and tried to preserve the wall graffiti. Many admirers published and even documented these graffiti by collecting images/photos of the mural taken by visitors, who were present during this historic period.

=== New Cairo campus ===
In the fall of 2008, AUC left the Greek Campus and officially inaugurated AUC New Cairo, a new 260-acre suburban campus in New Cairo, a satellite city about 20 miles (and 45 minutes) from the downtown campus. New Cairo is a governmental development comprising 46,000 acres of land with a projected population of 2.5 million people. AUC New Cairo provides advanced facilities for research and learning, as well as all the modern resources needed to support campus life. In its master plan for the new campus, the university mandated that the campus express the university&#x27;s values as a liberal arts institution, in what is essentially a non-Western context with deep traditional roots and high aspirations. The new campus is intended to serve as a case study for how architectural harmony and diversity can coexist creatively and how tradition and modernity can appeal to the senses. Campus spaces serve as virtual laboratories for the study of desert development, biological sciences, and the symbiotic relationship between environment and community. The two campuses together host 36 undergraduate programs and 46 graduate programs. The New Cairo campus offers six schools and ten research centers.

The Research Centers Building houses the AUC Forum, the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Center for American Studies, the John D. Gerhart Center for Philanthropy and Civic Engagement, and the Yousef Jameel Science and Technology Research Center.

The Dr. Hamza AlKholi Information Center houses AUC&#x27;s offices for enrollment, admissions, student financial affairs and student services. The Howard Theatre is located at The Hatem and Janet Mostafa Core Academic Center, along with the Mansour Group Lecture Hall, the Academic Advising Center and the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.

The AUC Center for the Arts includes two theaters: the Malak Gabr Arts and the Gerhart, as well as the Sharjah Art Gallery and offices for the Department of Performing and Visual Arts.

The university&#x27;s Campus Center provides students with a communal area to eat, congregate, organize trips, and attend campus-wide events. Inside the building are a bookstore, gift shop, bank, travel office and the main dining room. There is also a daycare center, a faculty lounge and the Office of Student Services, the Travel Office and the AUC Press Campus shop.

Near the Campus Center is the student-housing complex. Across from the student residences is the three-story AUC Sports Center, including a 2,000-seat multipurpose court, a jogging track, six squash courts, martial arts and exercise studios, a free weight studio, and training courts. Outdoor facilities include a 2,000-seat track and field stadium, swimming pool, soccer field, jogging and cycling track, and courts for tennis, basketball, handball and volleyball.

Housing one of the largest English-language collections in the region, AUC&#x27;s five-story library includes space for 600,000 volumes in the main library and 100,000 volumes in the Rare Books and Special Collections Library; locked carrels; computer workstations; video and audio production and editing labs; and comprehensive resources for digitizing, microfilming and preserving documents. In addition, on the plaza level of the library, the Learning Commons emphasizes group and collaborative learning. This unique area integrates independent study, interactive learning, multimedia and technology rooms, and copy and writing centers.

===Construction of New Cairo campus===
AUC New Cairo was built using 24,000 tons of reinforcing steel, as well as 115,000 square meters of stone, marble, granite cladding and flooring. More than 7,000 workers worked two shifts on the construction site.

Sandstone for the walls of campus buildings was provided by a single quarry in Kom Ombo, 50 kilometers north of Aswan. The stone arrived by truck in giant multi-ton blocks, which were cut and shaped for walls, arches and other uses at a stone-cutting plant built on the site. The walls were constructed according to energy management systems which reduce campus air conditioning and heating energy use by at least 50 percent as compared to conventional construction methods. More than 75 percent of the stone in the Alumni Wall that circles the campus was recycled from stone that would otherwise have been discarded as waste after cutting.

A 1.6-kilometer service tunnel that runs beneath the central avenue along the spine of AUC&#x27;s campus is a key element to making its overall pedestrian nature possible. Services accessible via the tunnel include all deliveries and pickups from campus buildings, fiber optic and technology-related wiring, major electrical conduits and plumbing for hot water, domestic water and chilled water for air conditioning. All other pipes for sewage, natural gas, irrigation and fire fighting are buried on the campus, outside the tunnel, around buildings as needed for their purposes.

===Inauguration and awards===
Margaret Scobey, former US Ambassador to Egypt, was among the guests at the inauguration in February 2009. In her remarks, Scobey said, 
Ambassador Scobey also delivered a message of congratulations to AUC from US President Barack Obama.

In 2013 AUC signed a 10-year lease agreement with Tahrir Alley Technology Park (TATP), a Cairo-based company that intends to keep the Greek Campus name, to operate the Greek Campus. AUC will retain full ownership. It turned over five buildings to TATP. This campus is to be developed as a technology park, encouraging start-ups and development of small businesses. TATP has said it will provide space on campus for approved artists.

The Urban Land Institute based in the United States recognized AUC&#x27;s new campus design and construction with a special award recognizing its energy efficiency, its architecture, its capacity for community development.

== Governance and administration ==
The American University in Cairo is an independent educational institution governed by a board of trustees. In addition, a panel of trustees &quot;emeriti&quot; functions as an advisory board. The Board has its own by-laws and elects a chairperson for an annual term. There are no students on the Board.
Francis Ricciardone was the president of AUC from 2016 until 2021. In February 2019, both the faculty and the student senate of the American University overwhelmingly voted that they had &quot;no confidence&quot; in Ricciardone&#x27;s leadership. In a letter to the president, the faculty cited &quot;low morale, complaints about his management style, grievances over contracts and accusations of illegal discrimination&quot; with tensions further increasing when Ricciardone invited U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to give a speech at the university.

The 13th president of AUC, Ahmad S. Dallal, graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from AUB. He obtained advanced degrees from and taught at several renown universities in the United States prior to taking on administrative positions at American University of Beirut from 2009 to 2015 and Georgetown University in Qatar from 2017 to 2021.

The university&#x27;s English-language liberal arts environment is designed to promote critical thinking, language and cultural skills as well as to foster in students an appreciation of their own culture and heritage and their responsibilities toward society. In November 2020, Provost Ehab Abdelrahman dissolved the graduate school of education without warning and without a plan to merge with the School of Humanities and Social Sciences.

AUC holds institutional accreditation from the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in the United States. AUC&#x27;s engineering programs are accredited by ABET (formerly Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) and the business programs are accredited by the Association to Advance College Schools of Business (AACSB). In Egypt, AUC operates within the framework of the 1975 protocol with the Egyptian government, which is based on the 1962 Cultural Relations Agreement between the U.S. and Egyptian governments. In the United States, AUC is licensed to grant degrees and is incorporated by the State of Delaware. In addition, many of AUC&#x27;s academic programs have received specialized accreditation.

Faculty at AUC are frequently harassed by senior administration, led by Abdelrahman. In 2019, Adam Duker was subjected to so-called investigations in an attempt to force him to resign. In 2022, Abdelrahman terminated a popular professor&#x27;s contract because he spoke out against corrupt policies and contract violations while advocating for a faculty union. Students were abruptly informed that the professor is &quot;not available&quot; and cancelled their classes with him.

Enrollment in academic programs includes over 5,474 undergraduates with an additional 979 graduate students (2017 - 2018). Simultaneously, adult education has also expanded and now serves more than 22,000 students each year in non-credit courses and contracted training programs offered through the School of Continuing Education. 94% of AUC students are Egyptian, with the remaining 6% from around the world.

<doc id="349288" wikidata="Q2294106" url="?curid=349288" title="The Day the World Went Away">
<text>&quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot; is a song by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released on July 20, 1999, as the lead single from their third studio album &quot;The Fragile&quot; (1999). The song was the band&#x27;s first top-forty hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 17, which remains their highest-ever position on the chart.

==Background==
&quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot; contains no drums. It was the only single credited to Reznor to reach the top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 until &quot;Old Town Road&quot; hit number one in 2019. The song was a staple in the encore during the Fragility tour, and has been performed in many shows since.

The compact disc single contains three songs: the original version and a &quot;quiet&quot; remix of &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot; and &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.&quot;, another song from &quot;The Fragile&quot;. The 12&quot; vinyl single replaced &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.&quot; with another version of &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot;, this one remixed by the electronic music duo Porter Ricks. The main version of the title track featured on the single is approximately 30 seconds shorter than the version found on &quot;The Fragile&quot; and features slightly different vocals.

The version of &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.&quot; featured on the single is almost identical to the album version, except that this version ends with the sound of Paul Stanley yelling &quot;Goodnight!&quot; to a cheering crowd. The yelling and crowd cheering are sampled from a KISS concert recording. The opening to &quot;Complication&quot;, the track which follows &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.&quot; on &quot;The Fragile&quot;, can be heard faintly alongside the crowd noise, augmented to sound like part of the concert.

The flower depicted on the cover of the single is a Kangaroo paw.

==Music video==

A music video was made for the song, but never released. Still images that were used on the official NIN website indicate that the video takes place at a funeral.

An alternate video for the song, using live audio and a combination of live and original footage, is included as an Easter egg on the second disc of the &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot; DVD.

==In popular culture==
A remixed version of the song was featured in the third theatrical trailer of &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;. It is also used again in the television series &quot;Person of Interest&quot;, from the episode of the same name.

The song is featured in the 2012 video game &quot;Spec Ops: The Line&quot;.

An orchestral version arranged by Ramin Djawadi was used in the trailer for the fourth season of &quot;Westworld&quot;.

The &quot;Still&quot; version of the song that appears on the album &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot; was featured in &quot;Omelette&quot;, the penultimate episode of the second season of &quot;The Bear&quot;.

<text>Things Falling Apart is the second remix album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released by Nothing Records and Interscope Records on November 21, 2000. It is the companion remix disc to the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;The Fragile&quot;. The U.S. promotional CD single for &quot;Into the Void&quot; is also labeled as &quot;Halo 16&quot;. &quot;10 Miles High&quot; is the only song that was a B-side to a Nine Inch Nails single to be included on the album, though the version on this release differs from the album/B-side version. It was only released on the vinyl version of &quot;The Fragile&quot;, while appearing as a B-side to the band&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;We&#x27;re in This Together&quot;.

Unlike &quot;The Fragile&quot;, which received mostly positive reviews, &quot;Things Falling Apart&quot; was critically panned by reviewers and even received a sarcastic rating of 10/10 from &quot;NME&quot;.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Trent Reznor, except where noted.

Notes
* The digital release is identical to the CD version, except each track is cut off by one second, affecting the seamless flow between several tracks.

<text>Platanus orientalis, the Oriental plane, is a large, deciduous tree of the Platanaceae family, growing to or more, and known for its longevity and spreading crown. In autumn its deep green leaves may change to blood red, amber, and yellow.

==Etymology==
The species&#x27; name &quot;orientalis&quot; means &#x27;eastern&#x27; (in comparison, the &#x27;western&#x27; plane (or American sycamore), the only other species known to Linnaeus, is named &quot;Platanus occidentalis&quot;). The tree was called &quot;platane&quot; in ancient Greek history and literature and by related names in continental Europe. Equally well known in Asia from Anatolia to India and usually called &quot;chinar&quot; or &quot;chenar&quot;.

==Range==
The native distribution is from Italy east through the Balkans, Turkey, and the Caucasus to Iran. Some accounts extend its native range west to the Iberia, Palestine to the south and to the Himalayas in the east. As it has been known in cultivation from early times in much of this region it can be difficult to determine if it is truly indigenous in peripheral areas.

==Description==

The oriental plane is found naturally in riverine settings, together with such trees as alder, willow and poplar. However, it is quite capable of survival and success in dry soils once it is established. It can grow into a massive tree with many examples hundreds of years old. Around ten trees are known from the past and present with a diameter of or more with several specimens around in total volume. A specimen in Ghirmizi Bazar, Karabakh, Republic of Azerbaijan is said to have a DBH of 28ft 2in (27 meters girth).

Like other plane trees, its leaves are borne alternately on the stem, deeply lobed, and palmate or maple-like. It usually has flaking bark, occasionally not flaking and becoming thick and rugged. Flowers and fruit are round and burr-like, borne in clusters of between two and six on a stem. Considerable variation exists among trees in the wild, and this may be complicated by crossbreeding with planted London planes (&quot;Platanus x acerifolia&quot;), the hybrid of &quot;P. orientalis&quot; with the American sycamore (&quot;Platanus occidentalis&quot;).

==Cultivation==
The tree is capable of being grown in most temperate latitudes, though it benefits greatly from warm summers. As a very large and wide tree with broad, thick leaves that tend to orient horizontally, it is especially prized for the shade and coolness it provides during the hot season.

It grows best in rich soil in a sunny location and can survive drought well, although young plants appreciate regular watering.

==Other uses==
The leaves and bark have been used medicinally. A fabric dye has been made from the twigs and roots. The timber, often called lacewood, is figured and valuable for indoor furniture. The leaves are also often used by artists for leaf carving.

==Cultural history==

===Iran===

Many plane trees in Iran are of historical importance and have been designated as cultural heritage. One such example is the plane tree of Osku, estimated to be 1,200 years old.

===Greece===
The Tree of Hippocrates, under which Hippocrates — the &quot;Father of Medicine&quot; — taught at Kos, is reputed to have been an oriental plane. A 500-year-old tree presently there may be on the same site and may have been planted from a succession of cuttings from the original. The Athenian Academy, outside Athens, featured a sacred grove of planes where the students listened to the masters and where among others the Peripatetics practiced philosophy.

Many villages in Greece feature plane trees in their main squares, frequently found alongside them are water springs that in the past would serve as the main water source for the villagers; usually these are quite old trees with their age seen as a point of pride for the local inhabitants. Occasionally the oldest trees exhibit partially hollowed out trunks, with cavities large enough to provide amusement opportunities for local or visiting children and teenagers, and even serving (along with the rest of the tree) as tourist attractions or at least in one occasion a shrine.

===Rome===
Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; records the westward progress of the plane &quot;introduced among us from a foreign clime for nothing but its shade&quot;, planted first at the tomb of Diomedes on the island of Tremiti, then imported to Greek Sicily by Dionysius the Elder (c. 432–367 BC), tyrant of Syracuse. He had plane-trees conveyed to the city of Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria), where they were looked upon as the great marvel of his palace, according to Pliny&#x27;s sources. From there it spread by the first century CE as far as the lands of the Morini in Belgic Gaul. Regardless of why it may have been introduced, the tree had medicinal uses from early times. Pliny details 25 remedies using preparation from the bark, leaves and excrescences of plane. Pliny prescribes it for burns, bites, stings, frostbite and infections.

Pliny goes on to describe some legendary plane trees. There was one on the grounds of the Athenian Academy, he says, that had roots long. Licinius Mucianus held a banquet for 19 in a hollow plane-tree of Lycia, and the emperor Caligula another for 15 plus servants in a tree house (nest) built in the branches of a plane-tree at Velletri.

===India===
The &quot;chinar&quot; tree can be found throughout the landscape of the Kashmir Valley in the Indian western Himalayas, planted across hillsides and cities, and is seen as a symbol for the region, locally known as &quot;bouin&quot; in Kashmiri and &quot;chinar&quot; in Hindustani. Excavations from the Burzahom archaeological site have revealed charcoal remains of the tree from the Neolithic period. Muslim Kashmiris believe that the &quot;chinar&quot; was brought to Kashmir valley by Islamic preachers from Iran in 14th century AD, while Hindu Kashmiris hold a view that the tree was traditionally planted near Hindu holy places in Kashmir and is associated with Hindu goddess &quot;Bhavani&quot;, from whom it derives its Kashmiri name &quot;bouin&quot;.

After the advent of Muslim rule, especially under the Mughals, &quot;chinar&quot; became a major garden and landscape tree, and dominates many historic gardens. The tree known for its elegance and exuberance has remained an attraction for artists and litterateurs. One tree believed to be planted in 1374 A.D at the Chattergam village by an Islamic mystic Syed Abul Qaim Hamadani who accompanied Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani from Iran to Kashmir, is believed by many in Kashmir to be the world&#x27;s oldest surviving chinar tree. Planting of chinar trees in Kashmir was greatly patronised by the Mughals, and later by Dogra rulers.

Chinar trees are being felled rapidly in Kashmir, although a ban was enacted in 2009 to curb cutting. Chinar trees are now required to be registered, considered State Property, and painted white at their base. Naseem Bagh, a Mughal garden near Srinagar with over 700 chinar trees has been developed as a Chinar Heritage Park by the University of Kashmir.

===United Kingdom===
In 2011 a specimen planted by Capability Brown at Corsham Court in Wiltshire was identified by The Tree Register of the British Isles as the tree with the greatest known spread in the United Kingdom.

An example dating to at least 1762 is one of Kew Gardens&#x27; thirteen &#x27;Heritage Trees&#x27;.

The Pococke Garden at Christ Church, Oxford contains a specimen, known as The Pococke Tree, which is understood to have been planted by Edward Pococke from seed he collected in 1636 from Aleppo. With a girth of around 9 metres it is the oldest in the UK.

==Cultural references==
A plane tree is the main theme in the aria Ombra mai fu composed by George Frideric Handel, in which the main character, Xerxes I of Persia, admires the shade of a plane tree. 

The Chinar leaf is considered a national symbol in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The government seal continues to include the leaf. Many universities, including the University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir also include the symbol. 

It is the State tree of the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. During the 2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony, held in India, the chinar tree was featured prominently in the &#x27;tree of knowledge&#x27; segment of the ceremony.

The Pococke Tree in the Pococke Garden at Christ Church is thought to be the inspiration for the Tumtum tree in Lewis Carol&#x27;s poem Jabberwocky.

<doc id="349299" wikidata="Q161374" url="?curid=349299" title="London plane">
<text>&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The London plane, or sometimes hybrid plane, Platanus × hispanica, is a tree in the genus &quot;Platanus&quot;. It is often known by the synonym Platanus × acerifolia, a later name. It is a hybrid of &quot;Platanus orientalis&quot; (oriental plane) and &quot;Platanus occidentalis&quot; (American sycamore). 

==Description==
The London plane is a large deciduous tree growing , exceptionally to tall, with a trunk up to in circumference. The bark is usually pale grey-green, smooth and exfoliating, or buff-brown and not exfoliating. The leaves are thick and stiff-textured, broad, palmately lobed, superficially maple-like, the leaf blade long and broad, with a petiole long. The young leaves in spring are coated with minute, fine, stiff hairs at first, but these wear off and by late summer the leaves are hairless or nearly so. The flowers are borne in one to three (most often two) dense spherical inflorescences on a pendulous stem, with male and female flowers on separate stems. The fruit matures in about 6 months, to diameter, and comprises a dense spherical cluster of achenes with numerous stiff hairs which aid wind dispersal; the cluster breaks up slowly over the winter to release the numerous seeds. The London Plane is one of the most efficient trees in removing small particulate pollutants in urban areas.

It shares many visual similarities with American sycamore (&quot;Platanus occidentalis&quot;), from which it is derived; however, the two species are relatively easy to distinguish, considering the London plane is almost exclusively planted in urban habitats, while American sycamore is most commonly found growing in lowlands and alluvial soils along streams.

==Origin==
The species was formed by hybridization in the 17th century after &quot;P. orientalis&quot; and &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; had been planted in proximity to one another. It is most likely that the hybridization took place in Spain or southern France, as the &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; parent needs considerable summer heat to grow well and is near-impossible to grow successfully in cooler climates like Britain, but there is also speculation that it could have happened in Vauxhall Gardens in London where John Tradescant the Younger saw the tree in the mid-17th century.
The leaf and flower characteristics are intermediate between the two parent species, the leaf being more deeply lobed than &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; but less so than &quot;P. orientalis&quot;, and the seed balls typically two per stem (one in &quot;P. occidentalis&quot;, 3–6 in &quot;P. orientalis&quot;). The hybrid is fertile, and seedlings are occasionally found near mature trees.

Controlled reciprocal pollinations between &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; and &quot;P. orientalis&quot; resulted in good yields of germinable seed and true hybrid seedlings. Crosses of both species, as females, with &quot;P. racemosa&quot; and &quot;P. wrightii&quot; produced extremely low yields of germinable seed, but true hybrids were obtained from all interspecific combinations. Apomixis (asexual reproduction from non-fertilized seeds) appeared common in &quot;P. orientalis&quot;.

In 1968 and 1970, Frank S. Santamour Jr. recreated the &quot;P. orientalis&quot; by &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; cross using a &quot;P. orientalis&quot; of Turkish origin with American sycamores (&quot;P. occidentalis&quot;). The offspring were evaluated following several years of exposure to anthracnose infection. Two selections, &#x27;Columbia&#x27; and &#x27;Liberty&#x27;, were released in August, 1984.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Platanus × hispanica&quot; was first formally described in the botanical literature by the German botanist Otto von Münchhausen in his 1770 work &quot;der Hausvater&quot;. Later, it was described in the botanical literature by the Scottish botanist William Aiton in his 1789 work &quot;Hortus Kewensis&quot; as a variety of &quot;P. orientalis&quot;. Aiton described this variety with a two-word Latin diagnosis, &quot;foliis transversis&quot;, and called it the Spanish plane tree. In 1805, Carl Ludwig Willdenow chose to elevate Aiton&#x27;s variety to species rank, publishing the new species &quot;P. acerifolia&quot; in the fourth edition of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. The species name was then modified to include the multiplication symbol to indicate its suspected hybrid parentage.

==Cultivation==

Two of 50 &quot;Great British Trees&quot; that the Tree Council selected in 2002 in honour of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee are London planes. The list specifically mentions Britain&#x27;s first London plane being in the city of Ely, Cambridgeshire.

The London plane is very tolerant of atmospheric pollution and root compaction, and for this reason it is a popular urban roadside tree. It was planted extensively in Victorian times to weather the pollution of London. It is now extensively cultivated in most temperate latitudes as an ornamental and parkland tree, and is a commonly planted tree in cities throughout the temperate regions of the world, in London and many other cities. It has a greater degree of winter cold tolerance than &quot;P. orientalis&quot;, and is less susceptible to anthracnose disease than &quot;P. occidentalis&quot;. The tree has gained the Royal Horticultural Society of Great Britain&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

The tree is fairly wind-resistant. However, it has a number of problems in urban use, most notably the short, stiff hairs shed by the young leaves and the dispersing seeds; these are an irritant if breathed in, and can exacerbate breathing difficulties for people with asthma. The vigorous roots can also cause problems with paving in cities, making uneven surfaces with tripping hazards. The large leaves can create a disposal problem in cities, as they are tough and sometimes can take more than one year to break down if they remain whole.

London planes are often pruned by a technique called pollarding. A pollarded tree has a drastically different appearance than an unpruned tree, being much shorter with stunted, club-like branches. Although pollarding requires frequent maintenance (the trees must usually be repruned every year), it creates a distinctive shape that is often sought after in plazas, main streets, and other urban areas.

===In New York City===
According to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation the symbol of that organization is a cross between the leaf of the London plane and a maple leaf. It is prominently featured on signs and buildings in public parks across the city. The tree is on the NYC Parks Department&#x27;s list of restricted use species for street tree planting, because it constitutes more than 10% of all street trees.

===In Australia===
In Australia, the London plane is used extensively as a street tree in major cities, particularly Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. The tree is commonly used because of its resilience to warm weather, its benefits as a shade tree, resistance to breakage and tolerance of urban pollution.

===In Johannesburg, South Africa===
In Johannesburg, South Africa many London planes line streets in older suburbs. In recent years the trees have been infested with the Polyphagous shot hole borer beetle (&quot;Euwallacea fornicatus&quot;). Some trees are reportedly developing resistance mechanisms but there are currently no effective measures against the borer beetle and it remains unclear how many trees will have to be cut down.

===In China===
The London plane is cultivated in central, northeastern and southern China.

===Timber===
When quarter-sawn, the timber has a distinctive and highly decorative appearance of dark reddish-brown flecks against a lighter background and is known as lacewood.

==Cultivars==
* &#x27;Augustine Henry&#x27;. This is a tall growing cultivar, with very large, pale green leaves. It produces a strong leader and a cylindrical trunk.
* &#x27;Bloodgood&#x27;, This is one of the first cultivars to be selected for anthracnose resistance. It is a rounded tree with deep green leaves that turn a poor yellow in fall. The plant tolerates poor cultural conditions, including heat, drought and poor soil. Recent observations indicate susceptibility to ozone.
* &#x27;Columbia&#x27;. Resists mildew and anthracnose, this tree has deeply lobed, dark green leaves.
* &#x27;Liberty&#x27;. A U.S. National Arboretum introduction, this pyramidal tree grows vigorously. It shows good tolerance for mildew, anthracnose, heat and drought.
*&#x27;Metzam&#x27; (Metroshade), A new introduction that grows strongly with a pyramidal habit, this cultivar is also said to be disease resistant with lustrous green foliage that emerges with a reddish cast.

<text>The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo is a children&#x27;s mystery television series that ran on Nickelodeon between 1996 and 1999. A total of 41 episodes of 30 minutes each were produced. Episodes from the first three seasons were taped at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, and was one of the few single-camera productions there, while the final season&#x27;s episodes were shot in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

== History ==
The series first aired in March 1996 as a six-episode test run, since Nickelodeon usually produced one major new series at a time and they were already producing &quot;Space Cases&quot;. The success of the test run prompted Nickelodeon to re-introduce the series on SNICK in January 1997, along with seven new episodes. During the show&#x27;s third season, production stopped after eight of a proposed thirteen episodes were filmed due to a crew strike, as the show&#x27;s budget did not cover the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees&#x27;s demands, partly due to the decision to shoot film instead of videotape. Production resumed in Montreal in February 1998, after Cinar agreed to co-produce the series. As a result, the show&#x27;s setting changed from Cocoa Beach, Florida, to Boston, Massachusetts.

Starring Irene Ng as the title character, the series revolves around the adventures of a Chinese American teenage girl who lives with her innkeeper grandfather and works as a non-sworn intern at the local police department where she helps out with odds and ends around the office. Occasionally an intriguing case comes to Shelby&#x27;s attention, prompting her to apply her unique insight and enlist the help of her friends to solve it. Her supervisors, however, do not appreciate her help, as she is only a teenager. Her grandfather also does not want her getting involved in cases, often reminding her &quot;We are not detectives with warrant badges, we are innkeepers with brooms.&quot; Many of the stories, with three clear suspects, keep the audience guessing until the truth is ultimately explained.

== Cast ==

She lives in Cocoa Beach, Florida in Seasons 1-3 and moved to Boston with her grandfather in Season 4.

Shelby&#x27;s parents are not seen though are mentioned in episode &quot;Hot Seats&quot; to be in China after Shelby receives a package from them.
* Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Woo (Pat Morita): Shelby&#x27;s loving grandfather and legal guardian who is looking after Shelby while her parents are in China.

<doc id="349303" wikidata="Q851" url="?curid=349303" title="Saudi Arabia">
<text>Saudi Arabia, officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is a country in West Asia. Located in the centre of the Middle East, it covers the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula and has a land area of about , making it the fifth-largest country in Asia, the largest in the Middle East, and the 12th-largest in the world. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the west; Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait to the north; the Persian Gulf, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to the east; Oman to the southeast; and Yemen to the south. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northwest separates Saudi Arabia from Egypt and Israel. Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. The capital and largest city is Riyadh; other major cities include Jeddah and the two holiest cities in Islam, Mecca and Medina. With a population of almost 32.2 million, Saudi Arabia is the fourth most populous country in the Arab world.

Pre-Islamic Arabia, the territory that constitutes modern-day Saudi Arabia, was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations; the prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity outside Africa. Islam, the world&#x27;s second-largest religion, emerged in what is now Saudi Arabia in the early seventh century. Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of the Arabian Peninsula and created a single Islamic religious polity. Following his death in 632, his followers expanded Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering territories in North Africa, Central, South Asia and Iberia within decades. Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun (632–661), Umayyad (661–750), Abbasid (750–1517), and Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates, as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia, Africa, and Europe.

Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by King Abdulaziz (also known as Ibn Saud), who united the regions of Hejaz, Najd, parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and South Arabia (Asir) into a single state through a series of conquests, beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy governed by an authoritarian regime without public input. In its Basic Law, Saudi Arabia defines itself as a sovereign Arab Islamic state with Islam as its official religion and Arabic as its official language. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam was the prevailing political and cultural force in the country until the 2000s. The Saudi government has attracted criticism for various policies such as its intervention in the Yemeni Civil War, alleged sponsorship of terrorism, and widespread human rights abuses.

Saudi Arabia is considered both a regional and middle power. Since petroleum was discovered in the country in 1938, the kingdom has become the world&#x27;s third-largest oil producer and leading oil exporter, controlling the world&#x27;s second-largest oil reserves and the sixth-largest gas reserves. Saudi Arabia is categorized as a World Bank high-income economy and is the only Arab country among the G20 major economies. The Saudi economy is the largest in the Middle East and the world&#x27;s nineteenth largest by nominal GDP and seventeenth largest by PPP. Ranking very high in the Human Development Index, Saudi Arabia offers tuition-free university education, no personal income tax, and free universal health care. With its dependency on foreign labour, Saudi Arabia has the world&#x27;s third-largest immigrant population. Saudi Arabians are among the world&#x27;s youngest people, with approximately half being under 25 years old. Saudi Arabia is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Arab League, and OPEC, as well as a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

== Etymology ==

Following the amalgamation of the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd, Abdulaziz issued a royal decree on 23 September 1932 naming the new state &quot;al-Mamlaka al-ʿArabiyya as-Suʿūdiyya&quot; (Arabic ), which is normally translated as &quot;the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia&quot; in English, but literally means &quot;the Saudi Arab Kingdom&quot;, or &quot;the Saudi Kingdom of Arabia&quot; (compare the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan).

The word &quot;Saudi&quot; is derived from the element &quot;as-Suʿūdīyya&quot; in the Arabic name of the country, which is a type of adjective known as a &quot;nisba,&quot; formed from the dynastic name of the Saudi royal family, the Al Saud (). Its inclusion expresses the view that the country is the personal possession of the royal family. &quot;Al Saud&quot; is an Arabic name formed by adding the word &quot;Al&quot;, meaning &quot;family of&quot; or &quot;House of&quot;, to the personal name of an ancestor. In the case of Al Saud, this is Saud ibn Muhammad ibn Muqrin, the father of the dynasty&#x27;s 18th-century founder, Muhammad bin Saud.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
There is evidence that human habitation in the Arabian Peninsula dates back to about years ago. A 2011 study found that the first modern humans to spread east across Asia left Africa about years ago across the Bab-el-Mandeb connecting the Horn of Africa and Arabia. The Arabian Peninsula is regarded as central to the understanding of evolution and dispersals of humanity. Arabia underwent an extreme environmental fluctuation in the Quaternary that led to profound evolutionary and demographic changes. Arabia has a rich Lower Paleolithic record, and the quantity of Oldowan-like sites in the region indicate a significant role that Arabia had played in the early hominin colonization of Eurasia.

In the Neolithic period, prominent cultures such as Al-Magar, whose centre lay in modern-day southwestern Najd, flourished. Al-Magar could be considered a &quot;Neolithic Revolution&quot; in human knowledge and handicraft skills. The culture is characterized as being one of the world&#x27;s first to involve the widespread domestication of animals, particularly the horse, during the Neolithic period. Al-Magar statues were made from local stone, and it seems that the statues were fixed in a central building that might have had a significant role in the social and religious life of the inhabitants.

In November 2017, hunting scenes showing images of most likely domesticated dogs (resembling the Canaan Dog) and wearing leashes were discovered in Shuwaymis, a hilly region of northwestern Saudi Arabia. These rock engravings date back more than years, making them the earliest depictions of dogs in the world.

At the end of the 4th millennium BC, Arabia entered the Bronze Age; metals were widely used, and the period was characterized by its 2 m high burials which were simultaneously followed by the existence of numerous temples that included many free-standing sculptures originally painted with red colours.

In May 2021, archaeologists announced that a -year-old Acheulean site named An Nasim in the Hail region could be the oldest human habitation site in northern Saudi Arabia. 354 artefacts, including hand axes and stone tools, provided information about the tool-making traditions of the earliest living man who inhabited southwest Asia. Paleolithic artefacts are similar to material remains uncovered at the Acheulean sites in the Nefud Desert.

=== Pre-Islamic ===
The earliest sedentary culture in Saudi Arabia dates back to the Ubaid period at Dosariyah. Climatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium. The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of Dilmun in the early 3rd millennium. Known records from Uruk refer to a place called Dilmun, associated on several occasions with copper, and in later periods it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. Scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that Tarout Island was the main port and the capital of Dilmun. Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggest that, in the early period of Dilmun, a form of hierarchical organized political structure existed. In 1966, an earthwork in Tarout exposed an ancient burial field that yielded a large statue dating to the Dilmunite period (mid 3rd millennium BC). The statue was locally made under the strong Mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of Dilmun.

By 2200 BC, the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the Saudi Arabian mainland to the island of Bahrain, and a highly developed settlement emerged there, where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds dating to this period were discovered.

By the late Bronze Age, a historically recorded people and land (Midian and the Midianites) in the north-western portion of Saudi Arabia are well-documented in the Bible. Centred in Tabouk, it stretched from Wadi Arabah in the north to the area of al-Wejh in the south. The capital of Midian was Qurayyah, it consists of a large, fortified citadel encompassing 35 hectares and below it lies a walled settlement of 15 hectares. The city hosted as many as 12,000 inhabitants. The Bible recounts Israel&#x27;s two wars with Midian, somewhere in the early 11th century BC. Politically, the Midianites were described as having a decentralized structure headed by five kings (Evi, Rekem, Tsur, Hur, and Reba); the names appear to be toponyms of important Midianite settlements. It is common to view that Midian designated a confederation of tribes, the sedentary element settled in the Hijaz while its nomadic affiliates pastured and sometimes pillaged as far away as Palestine. The nomadic Midianites were one of the earliest exploiters of the domestication of camels that enabled them to navigate through the harsh terrains of the region.

At the end of the 7th century BC, an emerging kingdom appeared in north-western Arabia. It started as a sheikdom of Dedan, which developed into the kingdom of Lihyan. During this period, Dedan transformed into a kingdom that encompassed a much wider domain. In the early 3rd century BC, with bustling economic activity between the south and north, Lihyan acquired large influence suitable to its strategic position on the caravan road. The Lihyanites ruled over a large domain from Yathrib in the south and parts of the Levant in the north. In antiquity, Gulf of Aqaba used to be called Gulf of Lihyan, a testimony to the extensive influence that Lihyan acquired.

The Lihyanites fell into the hands of the Nabataeans around 65 BC upon their seizure of Hegra then marching to Tayma, and to their capital Dedan in 9 BC. The Nabataeans ruled large portions of north Arabia until their domain was annexed by the Roman Empire, which renamed it Arabia Petraea, and remained under the rule of the Romans until 630.

=== Middle Ages and rise of Islam ===

Shortly before the advent of Islam, apart from urban trading settlements (such as Mecca and Medina), much of what was to become Saudi Arabia was populated by nomadic pastoral tribal societies. The Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca in about 570 CE. In the early 7th century, Muhammad united the various tribes of the peninsula and created a single Islamic religious polity. Following his death in 632, his followers expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering territory in the Iberian Peninsula in the west to parts of Central and South Asia in the east in a matter of decades. Arabia became a more politically peripheral region of the Muslim world as the focus shifted to the newly conquered lands.

Arabs originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia, the Hejaz in particular, founded the Rashidun (632–661), Umayyad (661–750), Abbasid (750–1517), and the Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates. From the 10th century to the early 20th century, Mecca and Medina were under the control of a local Arab ruler known as the Sharif of Mecca, but at most times the sharif owed allegiance to the ruler of one of the major Islamic empires based in Baghdad, Cairo or Istanbul. Most of the remainder of what became Saudi Arabia reverted to traditional tribal rule.
For much of the 10th century, the Isma&#x27;ili-Shi&#x27;ite Qarmatians were the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf. In 930, the Qarmatians pillaged Mecca, outraging the Muslim world, particularly with their theft of the Black Stone. In 1077–1078, an Arab sheikh named Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni defeated the Qarmatians in Bahrain and al-Hasa with the help of the Seljuq Empire and founded the Uyunid dynasty. The Uyunid Emirate later underwent expansion with its territory stretching from Najd to the Syrian Desert. They were overthrown by the Usfurids in 1253. Usfurid rule was weakened after Persian rulers of Hormuz captured Bahrain and Qatif in 1320. The vassals of Ormuz, the Shia Jarwanid dynasty came to rule eastern Arabia in the 14th century. The Jabrids took control of the region after overthrowing the Jarwanids in the 15th century and clashed with Hormuz for more than two decades over the region for its economic revenues, until finally agreeing to pay tribute in 1507. Al-Muntafiq tribe later took over the region and came under Ottoman suzerainty. The Bani Khalid tribe later revolted against them in the 17th century and took control. Their rule extended from Iraq to Oman at its height, and they too came under Ottoman suzerainty.

=== Ottoman Hejaz ===
In the 16th century, the Ottomans added the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast (the Hejaz, Asir and Al-Ahsa) to the empire and claimed suzerainty over the interior. One reason was to thwart Portuguese attempts to attack the Red Sea (hence the Hejaz) and the Indian Ocean. The Ottoman degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the empire&#x27;s central authority. These changes contributed to later uncertainties, such as the dispute with Transjordan over the inclusion of the sanjak of Ma&#x27;an, including the cities of Ma&#x27;an and Aqaba.

=== Saud dynasty and unification ===

The emergence of what was to become the Saudi royal family, known as the Al Saud, began at the town of Diriyah in Nejd in central Arabia with the accession as emir of Muhammad bin Saud on 22 February 1727. In 1744 he joined forces with the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, founder of the Wahhabi movement, a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam. This alliance provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today.

The Emirate of Diriyah established in the area around Riyadh rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of Saudi Arabia, sacking Karbala in 1802, and capturing Mecca in 1803. In 1818, it was destroyed by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, Mohammed Ali Pasha. The much smaller Emirate of Nejd was established in 1824. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the Al Saud contested control of the interior of what was to become Saudi Arabia with another Arabian ruling family, the Al Rashid, who ruled the Emirate of Jabal Shammar. By 1891, the Al Rashid were victorious and the Al Saud were driven into exile in Kuwait.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottoman Empire continued to control or have a suzerainty over most of the peninsula. Subject to this suzerainty, Arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers, with the Sharif of Mecca having pre-eminence and ruling the Hejaz. In 1902, Abdul Rahman&#x27;s son, Abdulaziz—later known as Ibn Saud—recaptured control of Riyadh bringing the Al Saud back to Nejd, creating the third &quot;Saudi state&quot;. Ibn Saud gained the support of the Ikhwan, a tribal army inspired by Wahhabism and led by Faisal Al-Dawish, and which had grown quickly after its foundation in 1912. With the aid of the Ikhwan, Ibn Saud captured Al-Ahsa from the Ottomans in 1913.

In 1916, with the encouragement and support of Britain (which was fighting the Ottomans in World War I), the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali, led a pan-Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire to create a united Arab state. Although the revolt failed in its objective, the Allied victory in World War I resulted in the end of Ottoman suzerainty and control in Arabia, and Hussein bin Ali became King of Hejaz.

Ibn Saud avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid. Following the latter&#x27;s final defeat, he took the title Sultan of Nejd in 1921. With the help of the Ikhwan, the Kingdom of Hejaz was conquered in 1924–25, and on 10 January 1926, Ibn Saud declared himself king of Hejaz. For the next five years, he administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units.

After the conquest of the Hejaz, the Ikhwan leadership&#x27;s objective switched to expansion of the Wahhabist realm into the British protectorates of Transjordan, Iraq and Kuwait, and began raiding those territories. This met with Ibn Saud&#x27;s opposition, as he recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the British. At the same time, the Ikhwan became disenchanted with Ibn Saud&#x27;s domestic policies which appeared to favour modernization and the increase in the number of non-Muslim foreigners in the country. As a result, they turned against Ibn Saud and, after a two-year struggle, were defeated in 1929 at the Battle of Sabilla, where their leaders were massacred. On Ibn Saud&#x27;s behalf, Prince Faisal declared the unification on 23 September 1932, and the two kingdoms of Hejaz and Nejd were unified as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. That date is now a national holiday called Saudi National Day.

=== 20th century ===
The new kingdom was reliant on limited agriculture and pilgrimage revenues. In 1938, vast reserves of oil were discovered in the Al-Ahsa region along the coast of the Persian Gulf, and full-scale development of the oil fields began in 1941 under the US-controlled Aramco (Arabian American Oil Company). Oil provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and substantial political leverage internationally. Cultural life rapidly developed, primarily in the Hejaz, which was the centre for newspapers and radio. However, the large influx of foreign workers in Saudi Arabia in the oil industry increased the pre-existing propensity for xenophobia. At the same time, the government became increasingly wasteful and extravagant. By the 1950s this had led to large governmental deficits and excessive foreign borrowing. In 1953, Saud of Saudi Arabia succeeded as the king of Saudi Arabia. In 1964 he was deposed in favour of his half brother Faisal of Saudi Arabia, after an intense rivalry, fuelled by doubts in the royal family over Saud&#x27;s competence. In 1972, Saudi Arabia gained a 20% control in Aramco, thereby decreasing US control over Saudi oil. In 1973, Saudi Arabia led an oil boycott against the Western countries that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War against Egypt and Syria, leading to the quadrupling of oil prices. In 1975, Faisal was assassinated by his nephew, Prince Faisal bin Musaid and was succeeded by his half-brother King Khalid.
By 1976, Saudi Arabia had become the largest oil producer in the world. Khalid&#x27;s reign saw economic and social development progress at an extremely rapid rate, transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the country; in foreign policy, close ties with the US were developed. In 1979, two events occurred which greatly concerned the government and had a long-term influence on Saudi foreign and domestic policy. The first was the Iranian Islamic Revolution. It was feared that the country&#x27;s Shi&#x27;ite minority in the Eastern Province (which is also the location of the oil fields) might rebel under the influence of their Iranian co-religionists. There were several anti-government uprisings in the region such as the 1979 Qatif Uprising. The second event was the Grand Mosque Seizure in Mecca by Islamist extremists. The militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un-Islamic nature of the Saudi government. The government regained control of the mosque after 10 days, and those captured were executed. Part of the response of the royal family was to enforce the much stricter observance of traditional religious and social norms in the country (for example, the closure of cinemas) and to give the ulema a greater role in government. Neither entirely succeeded as Islamism continued to grow in strength.
In 1980, Saudi Arabia bought out the American interests in Aramco. King Khalid died of a heart attack in June 1982. He was succeeded by his brother, King Fahd, who added the title &quot;Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques&quot; to his name in 1986 in response to considerable fundamentalist pressure to avoid the use of &quot;majesty&quot; in association with anything except God. Fahd continued to develop close relations with the United States and increased the purchase of American and British military equipment. The vast wealth generated by oil revenues was beginning to have an even greater impact on Saudi society. It led to rapid technological (but not cultural) modernization, urbanization, mass public education, and the creation of new media. This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi norms and values. Although there was a dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country, political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government.

In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait spent $25 billion in support of Saddam Hussein in the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988); however, Saudi Arabia condemned the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and asked the United States to intervene. King Fahd allowed American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. He invited the Kuwaiti government and many of its citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia, but expelled citizens of Yemen and Jordan because of their governments&#x27; support of Iraq. In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait, which became known as the Gulf War (1990–1991).

Saudi Arabia&#x27;s relations with the West was one of the issues that led to an increase in Islamist terrorism in Saudi Arabia, as well as Islamist terrorist attacks in Western countries by Saudi nationals. Osama bin Laden was a Saudi citizen (until stripped of his citizenship in 1994) and was responsible for the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa and the 2000 USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing near the port of Aden, Yemen. 15 of the hijackers involved in the September 11 attacks were Saudi nationals. Many Saudis who did not support the Islamist terrorists were nevertheless deeply unhappy with the government&#x27;s policies.

Islamism was not the only source of hostility to the government. Although extremely wealthy by the 21st century, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s economy was near stagnant. High taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent and have been reflected in a rise in civil unrest, and discontent with the royal family. In response, a number of limited reforms were initiated by King Fahd. In March 1992, he introduced the &quot;Basic Law&quot;, which emphasized the duties and responsibilities of a ruler. In December 1993, the Consultative Council was inaugurated. It is composed of a chairman and 60 members—all chosen by the King. Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind, saying: &quot;A system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed, which [approves of] government by consultation [shūrā].&quot;

In 1995, Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke, and the Crown Prince, Abdullah, assumed the role of &quot;de facto&quot; regent; however, his authority was hindered by conflict with Fahd&#x27;s full brothers (known, with Fahd, as the &quot;Sudairi Seven&quot;).

=== 21st century ===
Signs of discontent included, in 2003 and 2004, a series of bombings and armed violence in Riyadh, Jeddah, Yanbu and Khobar. In February–April 2005, the first-ever nationwide municipal elections were held in Saudi Arabia. Women were not allowed to take part.

In 2005, King Fahd died and was succeeded by Abdullah, who continued the policy of minimum reform and clamping down on protests. The king introduced economic reforms aimed at reducing the country&#x27;s reliance on oil revenue: limited deregulation, encouragement of foreign investment, and privatization. In February 2009, Abdullah announced a series of governmental changes to the judiciary, armed forces, and various ministries to modernize these institutions including the replacement of senior appointees in the judiciary and the Mutaween (religious police) with more moderate individuals and the appointment of the country&#x27;s first female deputy minister.

On 29 January 2011, hundreds of protesters gathered in Jeddah in a rare display of criticism against the city&#x27;s poor infrastructure after flooding killed 11 people. Police stopped the demonstration after about 15 minutes and arrested 30 to 50 people.

Since 2011, Saudi Arabia has been affected by its own Arab Spring protests. In response, King Abdullah announced on 22 February 2011 a series of benefits for citizens amounting to $36 billion, of which $10.7 billion was earmarked for housing. No political reforms were included, though some prisoners indicted for financial crimes were pardoned. Abdullah also announced a package of $93 billion, which included 500,000 new homes to a cost of $67 billion, in addition to creating new security jobs. Although male-only municipal elections were held on 29 September 2011, Abdullah allowed women to vote and be elected in the 2015 municipal elections, and also to be nominated to the Shura Council.

== Geography ==


Saudi Arabia occupies about 80% of the Arabian Peninsula (the world&#x27;s largest peninsula), lying between latitudes 16° and 33° N, and longitudes 34° and 56° E. Because the country&#x27;s southeastern and southern borders with the United Arab Emirates and Oman are not precisely marked, the exact size of the country is undefined. The United Nations Statistics Division estimates and lists Saudi Arabia as the world&#x27;s 12th largest state. It is geographically the largest country in the Middle East and on the Arabian Plate.

Saudi Arabia&#x27;s geography is dominated by the Arabian Desert, associated semi-desert, shrubland, steppes, several mountain ranges, volcanic lava fields and highlands. The Rub&#x27; al Khali (&quot;Empty Quarter&quot;) in the southeastern part of the country is the world&#x27;s largest contiguous sand desert. Though there are lakes in the country, Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the world by area with no permanent rivers. Wadis, non-permanent rivers, however, are very numerous throughout the kingdom. The fertile areas are to be found in the alluvial deposits in wadis, basins, and oases. There are approximately 1,300 islands in the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf.

The main topographical feature is the central plateau which rises abruptly from the Red Sea and gradually descends into the Nejd and toward the Arabian Gulf. On the Red Sea coast, there is a narrow coastal plain, known as the Tihamah, parallel to which runs along an imposing escarpment. The southwest province of Asir is mountainous and contains the Jabal Ferwa, which is the highest point in the country. Saudi Arabia is home to more than 2,000 dormant volcanoes. Lava fields in Hejaz, known locally by their Arabic name of harrat (the singular is harrah), form one of Earth&#x27;s largest alkali basalt regions, covering some .

Except for the southwestern regions such as Asir, Saudi Arabia has a desert climate with very high day-time temperatures during the summer and a sharp temperature drop at night. Average summer temperatures are around but can be as high as . In the winter the temperature rarely drops below with the exception of mostly the northern regions of the country where annual snowfall, in particular in the mountainous regions of Tabuk Province, is not uncommon. The lowest recorded temperature, −12.0 °C (10.4 °F), was measured in Turaif. Of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia is likely to experience snowfalls most frequently.

In the spring and autumn the heat is temperate, temperatures average around . Annual rainfall is very low. The southern regions differ in that they are influenced by the Indian Ocean monsoons, usually occurring between October and March. An average of of rainfall occurs during this period, which is about 60% of the annual precipitation.

=== Biodiversity ===
Saudi Arabia is home to five terrestrial ecoregions: Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert, Southwestern Arabian foothills savanna, Southwestern Arabian montane woodlands, Arabian Desert, and Red Sea Nubo-Sindian tropical desert and semi-desert. Wildlife includes the Arabian leopard, Arabian wolf, striped hyena, mongoose, baboon, Cape hare, sand cat, and jerboa. Animals such as gazelles, oryx, leopards and cheetahs were relatively numerous until the 19th century, when extensive hunting reduced these animals almost to extinction. The culturally important Asiatic lion occurred in Saudi Arabia until the late 19th century before it was hunted to extinction in the wild. Birds include falcons (which are caught and trained for hunting), eagles, hawks, vultures, sandgrouse, and bulbuls. There are several species of snakes, many of which are venomous. Domesticated animals include the legendary Arabian horse, Arabian camel, sheep, goats, cattle, donkeys, chickens, etc.

The Red Sea is a rich and diverse ecosystem with more than 1,200 species of fish around 10% of which are endemic. This also includes 42 species of deep water fish. The rich diversity is partly owed to the of coral reef extending along the coastline; these fringing reefs are largely formed of stony acropora and porites corals. The reefs form platforms and sometimes lagoons along the coast and occasional other features such as cylinders (such as the Blue Hole at Dahab). These coastal reefs are also visited by pelagic species, including some of the 44 species of shark. There are many offshore reefs including several atolls. Many of the unusual offshore reef formations defy classic (i.e., Darwinian) coral reef classification schemes and are generally attributed to the high levels of tectonic activity that characterize the area.

Reflecting the country&#x27;s dominant desert conditions, plant life mostly consists of herbs, plants, and shrubs that require little water. The date palm (&quot;Phoenix dactylifera&quot;) is widespread.

== Government and politics ==

Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy; however, according to the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia adopted by royal decree in 1992, the king must comply with Sharia (Islamic law) and the Quran, while the Quran and the Sunnah (the traditions of Muhammad) are declared to be the country&#x27;s constitution. No political parties or national elections are permitted. While some critics consider it to be a totalitarian state, others regard it as lacking aspects of totalitarianism but nevertheless classify it as an authoritarian regime. &quot;The Economist&quot; ranked the Saudi government 150th out of 167 in its 2022 Democracy Index, and Freedom House gave it its lowest &quot;Not Free&quot; rating, giving it a score of 8 out of 100 for 2023. According to the 2023 V-Dem Democracy Indices, Saudi Arabia is the least democratic country in the Middle East.

In the absence of national elections and political parties, politics in Saudi Arabia takes place in two distinct arenas: within the royal family, the Al Saud, and between the royal family and the rest of Saudi society. Outside of the Al Saud, participation in the political process is limited to a relatively small segment of the population and takes the form of the royal family consulting with the ulema, tribal sheikhs, and members of important commercial families on major decisions. This process is not reported by the Saudi media.

By custom, all males of full age have a right to petition the king directly through the traditional tribal meeting known as the &quot;majlis&quot;. In many ways the approach to government differs little from the traditional system of tribal rule. Tribal identity remains strong, and outside of the royal family, political influence is frequently determined by tribal affiliation, with tribal sheikhs maintaining a considerable degree of influence over local and national events. In recent years there have been limited steps to widen political participation such as the establishment of the Consultative Council in the early 1990s and the National Dialogue Forum in 2003. In 2005, the first municipal elections were held. In 2007, the Allegiance Council was created to regulate the succession. In 2009, the king made significant personnel changes to the government by appointing reformers to key positions and the first woman to a ministerial post; however, these changes have been criticized as being too slow or merely cosmetic.

The rule of the Al Saud faces political opposition from four sources: Sunni Islamist activism; liberal critics; the Shi&#x27;ite minority—particularly in the Eastern Province; and long-standing tribal and regionalist particularistic opponents (for example in the Hejaz). Of these, the minority activists have been the most prominent threat to the government and have in recent years been involved in violent incidents in the country. However, open protest against the government, even if peaceful, is not tolerated.

=== Monarchy and royal family ===
The king combines legislative, executive, and judicial functions and royal decrees form the basis of the country&#x27;s legislation. The prime minister presides over the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia and Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia. The king has usually been also the prime minister, with two exceptions: Crown Prince Faisal, who was prime minister during the reign of King Saud, and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the current prime minister since 2022. The royal family dominates the political system. The family&#x27;s vast numbers allows it to control most of the kingdom&#x27;s important posts and to have an involvement and presence at all levels of government. The number of princes is estimated to be at least , with most power and influence being wielded by the 200 or so male descendants of Ibn Saud. The key ministries are generally reserved for the royal family, as are the 13 regional governorships.
The Saudi government and the royal family have often been accused of corruption over many years, and this continues into the 21st century. In a country that is said to &quot;belong&quot; to the royal family and is named for them, the lines between state assets and the personal wealth of senior princes are blurred. The extent of corruption has been described as systemic and endemic, and its existence was acknowledged and defended by Prince Bandar bin Sultan (a senior member of the royal family) in an interview in 2001.

In its Corruption Perceptions Index for 2010, Transparency International gave Saudi Arabia a score of 4.7 (on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is &quot;highly corrupt&quot; and 10 is &quot;highly clean&quot;). Saudi Arabia has undergone a process of political and social reform, such as to increase public transparency and good governance, but nepotism and patronage are widespread when doing business in the country; the enforcement of the anti-corruption laws is selective and public officials engage in corruption with impunity. As many as 500 people, including prominent Saudi Arabian princes, government ministers, and businesspeople, were arrested in an anti-corruption campaign in November 2017.

=== Al ash-Sheikh and role of the ulema ===
Saudi Arabia is unique in giving the ulema (the body of Islamic religious leaders and jurists) a direct role in government. The preferred ulema are of the Salafi movement. The ulema have been a key influence in major government decisions, for example the imposition of the oil embargo in 1973 and the invitation to foreign troops to Saudi Arabia in 1990. In addition, they have had a major role in the judicial and education systems and a monopoly of authority in religious and social morals.

By the 1970s, as a result of oil wealth and the modernization initiated by King Faisal, important changes to Saudi society were underway, and the power of the ulema was in decline. However, this changed following the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 by Islamist radicals. The government&#x27;s response to the crisis included strengthening the ulema&#x27;s powers and increasing their financial support: in particular, they were given greater control over the education system and allowed to enforce the stricter observance of Wahhabi rules of moral and social behaviour. After his accession to the throne in 2005, King Abdullah took steps to reduce the powers of the ulema, for instance transferring control over girls&#x27; education to the Ministry of Education.

The ulema have historically been led by the Al ash-Sheikh, the country&#x27;s leading religious family. The Al ash-Sheikh are the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the 18th-century founder of the Wahhabi form of Sunni Islam which is today dominant in Saudi Arabia. The family is second in prestige only to the Al Saud (the royal family) with whom they formed a &quot;mutual support pact&quot; and power-sharing arrangement nearly 300 years ago. The pact, which persists to this day, is based on the Al Saud maintaining the Al ash-Sheikh&#x27;s authority in religious matters and upholding and propagating Wahhabi doctrine. In return, the Al ash-Sheikh support the Al Saud&#x27;s political authority thereby using its religious-moral authority to legitimize the royal family&#x27;s rule. Although the Al ash-Sheikh&#x27;s domination of the ulema has diminished in recent decades, they still hold the most important religious posts and are closely linked to the Al Saud by a high degree of intermarriage.

=== Legal system ===

The primary source of law is the Islamic Sharia derived from the teachings of the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah (the traditions of the Prophet). Saudi Arabia is unique among modern Muslim states in that Sharia is not codified and there is no system of judicial precedent, allowing judges to use independent legal reasoning to make a decision. Thus, divergent judgments arise even in apparently identical cases, making predictability of legal interpretation difficult. Saudi judges tend to follow the principles of the Hanbali school of jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;) found in pre-modern texts and noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur&#x27;an and hadith. However, in 2021, Saudi Arabia announced judicial reforms which will lead to an entirely codified law that eliminates discrepancies.

Royal decrees are the other main source of law but are referred to as &quot;regulations&quot; rather than &quot;laws&quot; because they are subordinate to the Sharia. Royal decrees supplement Sharia in areas such as labour, commercial and corporate law. Additionally, traditional tribal law and custom remain significant. Extra-Sharia government tribunals usually handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees. Final appeal from both Sharia courts and government tribunals is to the king, and all courts and tribunals follow Sharia rules of evidence and procedure.

Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at the insistence of a victim who lost his own eye. Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya (blood money), by the perpetrator.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Saudi Arabia is divided into 13 regions (; &quot;manatiq idāriyya&quot;, sing. منطقة إدارية; &quot;mintaqah idariyya&quot;). The regions are further divided into 118 governorates (; &quot;muhafazat&quot;, sing. محافظة; &quot;muhafazah&quot;). This number includes the 13 regional capitals, which have a different status as municipalities (; &quot;amanah&quot;) headed by mayors (; &quot;amin&quot;). The governorates are further subdivided into sub-governorates (; &quot;marakiz&quot;, sing. مركز; &quot;markaz&quot;).

=== Foreign relations ===

Saudi Arabia joined the UN in 1945 and is a founding member of the Arab League, Gulf Cooperation Council, Muslim World League, and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation). It plays a prominent role in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and in 2005 joined the World Trade Organization.

Since 1960, as a founding member of OPEC, its oil pricing policy has been generally to stabilize the world oil market and try to moderate sharp price movements so as not to jeopardize the Western economies. In 1973, Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations imposed an oil embargo against the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and other Western nations which supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War of October 1973. The embargo caused an oil crisis with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy.
Saudi Arabia and the United States are strategic allies, and Saudi Arabia is considered to be pro-Western. On 20 May 2017, President Donald Trump and King Salman signed a series of letters of intent for Saudi Arabia to purchase arms from the United States totaling $350 billion over 10 years. Saudi Arabia&#x27;s role in the 1991 Gulf War, particularly the stationing of US troops on Saudi soil from 1991, prompted the development of a hostile Islamist response internally. As a result, Saudi Arabia has, to some extent, distanced itself from the US and, for example, refused to support or to participate in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

China and Saudi Arabia&#x27;s relationship has grown significantly in recent decades. A significant number of Saudi Arabians have also expressed a positive view of China. In February 2019, Crown Prince Mohammad defended China&#x27;s Xinjiang internment camps for Uyghur Muslims. According to &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s human rights record has &quot;come under frequent attack abroad and so defending China becomes a roundabout way of defending themselves.&quot;

The consequences of the 2003 invasion and the Arab Spring led to increasing alarm within the Saudi monarchy over the rise of Iran&#x27;s influence in the region. These fears were reflected in comments of King Abdullah, who privately urged the United States to attack Iran and &quot;cut off the head of the snake&quot;.
Saudi Arabia has been seen as a moderating influence in the Arab–Israeli conflict, periodically putting forward a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians and condemning Hezbollah. Saudi Arabia halted new trade and investment dealings with Canada and suspended diplomatic ties in a dramatic escalation of a dispute over the kingdom&#x27;s arrest of women&#x27;s rights activist Samar Badawi on 6 August 2018.

In 2017, as part of its nuclear power programme, Saudi Arabia planned to extract uranium domestically, taking a step towards self-sufficiency in producing nuclear fuel.

====Allegations of sponsoring global terrorism====
Saudi Arabia has been accused of sponsoring Islamic terrorism. According to Iraq Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in March 2014, Saudi Arabia along with Qatar provided political, financial, and media support to terrorists against the Iraqi government. Similarly, President of Syria Bashar al-Assad noted in 2015 that the sources of the extreme ideology of the terrorist organization ISIS and other such salafist extremist groups are the Wahabbism that has been supported by the royal family of Saudi Arabia.

Relations with the U.S. became strained following 9/11 terror attacks. American politicians and media accused the Saudi government of supporting terrorism and tolerating a &quot;jihadist&quot; culture. According to former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in December 2010, &quot;Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-Qaida, the Taliban, LeT and other terrorist groups... Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.&quot; The Saudi government denies these claims or that it exports religious or cultural extremism. In September 2016, the U.S. Congress passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act that would allow relatives of victims of the 11 September attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for its government&#x27;s alleged role in the attacks.
In 2014, Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah Al-Sheikh, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia and Chairman of the Council of Senior Scholars, issued a fatwa explicitly prohibiting joining or supporting terrorist organizations such as ISIS and al-Qaeda. According to the U.S. Department of State, &quot;Saudi Arabia plays an important role in working toward a peaceful and prosperous future for the region and is a strong partner in security and counterterrorism efforts and in military, diplomatic, and financial cooperation.&quot; A significant Saudi counterterrorism success was the foiling of a 2010 cargo plane bomb plot. In December 2015, Saudi Arabia announced the formation of the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, an alliance of Muslim-majority countries aimed at combating terrorism and extremism.

However, since 2016 the kingdom began backing away from Islamist ideologies. Several reforms took place including curbing the powers of religious police, and stopping funding mosques in foreign countries.

=== Military ===

Saudi Arabia&#x27;s military forces include the Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia under the Ministry of Defence, which consist of the Royal Saudi Land Forces (including the Royal Guard), the Air Force, the Navy, the Air Defence, and the Strategic Missile Force; the Saudi Arabian National Guard under the Ministry of National Guard; paramilitary forces under the Minister of Interior, including the Saudi Arabian Border Guard and the Facilities Security Force; and the Presidency of State Security, including the Special Security Force and the Emergency Force. As of 2023 there are 127,000 active personnel in the Armed Forces, 130,000 in the National Guard, and 24,500 in the paramilitary security forces. The National Guard is made up of tribal forces that are loyal to the Saudi royal family and have a role in both domestic security and foreign defence. Saudi Arabia has security relationships with the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, which provide it with training and weapons.

Saudi Arabia has one of the highest percentages of military expenditure in the world, spending around 7% of its GDP in its military, according to the 2023 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimate, which places it as the world&#x27;s fifth largest military spender behind the United States, Russia, India and China, and the world&#x27;s second largest arms importer from 2019 to 2023, receiving 15 per cent of all U.S. arms exports. Spending on defence and security has increased significantly since the mid-1990s and was about US$78.4 billion as of 2019. According to the BICC, Saudi Arabia is the 28th most militarized country in the world and possesses the second-best military equipment qualitatively in the region, after Israel. Its modern high-technology arsenal makes Saudi Arabia among the world&#x27;s most densely armed nations.

The kingdom has a long-standing military relationship with Pakistan; it has long been speculated that Saudi Arabia secretly funded Pakistan&#x27;s atomic bomb programme and seeks to purchase atomic weapons from Pakistan in the near future.

In March 2015, Saudi Arabia mobilized 150,000 troops and 100 fighter jets to support its intervention in the civil war in neighbouring Yemen. By early 2016, Saudi ground forces and their coalition allies captured Aden and parts of southwest Yemen, though the Houthis continued to control northern Yemen and the capital city Sanaa. From there the Houthis launched successful attacks across the border into Saudi Arabia. The Saudi military has also carried out an aerial bombing campaign and a naval blockade aimed at stopping weapons shipments to the Houthis.

=== Human rights ===


The Saudi government, which mandates Muslim and non-Muslim observance of Sharia law under the absolute rule of the House of Saud, has been denounced by various international organizations and governments for violating human rights within the country. The authoritarian regime is consistently ranked among the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; in Freedom House&#x27;s annual survey of political and civil rights. According to Amnesty International, security forces continue to torture and ill-treat detainees to extract confessions to be used as evidence against them at trial. Saudi Arabia abstained from the United Nations vote adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, saying it contradicted Sharia. Mass executions, such as those carried out in 2016, 2019, and 2022, have been condemned by international rights groups.

Since 2001, Saudi Arabia has engaged in widespread internet censorship. Most online censorship generally falls into two categories: one based on censoring &quot;immoral&quot; (mostly pornographic and LGBT-supportive websites along with websites promoting any religious ideology other than Sunni Islam) and one based on a blacklist run by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Ministry of Media, which primarily censors websites critical of the Saudi regime or associated with parties that are opposed to or opposed by Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabian law does not recognize sexual orientations or religious freedom, and the public practice of non-Muslim religions is actively prohibited. The justice system regularly engages in capital punishment, which has included public executions by beheading. In line with Sharia in the Saudi justice system, the death penalty can theoretically be imposed for a wide range of offenses, including murder, rape, armed robbery, repeated drug use, apostasy, adultery, witchcraft and sorcery, and can be carried out by beheading with a sword, stoning or firing squad, followed by crucifixion (exposure of the body after execution). In 2022, the Saudi Crown Prince stated that capital punishments will be removed &quot;except for one category mentioned in the Quran&quot;, namely homicide, under which certain conditions must be applied. In April 2020, Saudi Supreme Court issued a directive to eliminate the punishment of flogging from the Saudi court system, replaced by imprisonment or fines.

Historically, Saudi women faced discrimination in many aspects of their lives and under the male guardianship system were effectively treated as legal minors. The treatment of women had been referred to as &quot;sex segregation&quot; and &quot;gender apartheid&quot;. As of June 2023, the kingdom has reportedly reversed its ban on women &quot;becoming lawyers, engineers, or geologists&quot; and established &quot;aggressive affirmative action programmes&quot;, doubling the female labour force participation rate. It has added &quot;its first female newspaper editors, diplomats, TV anchors and public prosecutors&quot;, with a female head of the Saudi stock exchange and member on the board of Saudi Aramco.
In addition, on June 24, 2018, the Saudi government issued a law officially allowing women to drive.

Saudi Arabia is a notable destination country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of slave labour and commercial sexual exploitation. Migrants from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East are employed in the country&#x27;s construction, hospitality, and domestic work sectors under the kafala system which human rights groups say is linked to abuses including modern slavery.

== Economy ==
With gross domestic product (GDP) at over $1.1 trillion nominally, and more than $2.3 trillion by purchasing power parity (PPP), Saudi Arabia has the second largest economy in the Middle East (after Türkiye), the largest in the Arab world, and the 18th largest in the world. It has the world&#x27;s second-largest proven reserves of petroleum, of which it is third largest producer and the largest exporter; the country also has the sixth-largest proven natural gas reserves. Saudi Arabia is considered an &quot;energy superpower,&quot; having the second highest total estimated value of natural resources, valued at US$34.4 trillion in 2016.

Saudi Arabia has a command economy based largely on petroleum; the oil industry accounts for roughly 63% of budget revenue, 67% of export earnings, and 45% of nominal GDP compared with 40% from the private sector. It is strongly dependent on foreign workers, with about 80% of private sector employees being non-Saudi. Challenges to the economy include halting or reversing the decline in per-capita income, improving education to prepare youth for the workforce and providing them with employment, diversifying the economy, stimulating the private sector and housing construction, and diminishing corruption and inequality.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) limits its members&#x27; oil production based on their &quot;proven reserves&quot;. Saudi Arabia&#x27;s published reserves have shown little change since 1980, with the main exception being an increase of about between 1987 and 1988. Matthew Simmons has suggested that Saudi Arabia is greatly exaggerating its reserves and may soon show production declines (see peak oil).
From 2003 to 2013, &quot;several key services&quot; were privatized—municipal water supply, electricity, telecommunications—and parts of education and health care, traffic control and car accident reporting were also privatized. According to Arab News columnist Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg, &quot;in almost every one of these areas, consumers have raised serious concerns about the performance of these privatized entities.&quot; In November 2005, Saudi Arabia was approved as a member of the World Trade Organization. Negotiations to join had focused on the degree to which Saudi Arabia is willing to increase market access to foreign goods and in 2000, the government established the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority to encourage foreign direct investment in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia maintains a list of sectors in which foreign investment is prohibited, but the government plans to open some closed sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time. The government has also made an attempt at &quot;Saudizing&quot; the economy, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals with limited success.
In addition to petroleum and gas, Saudi has a significant gold mining sector in the Mahd adh Dhahab region and significant other mineral industries, an agricultural sector (especially in the southwest) based on vegetables, fruits, dates etc. and livestock, and large number of temporary jobs created by the roughly two million annual &quot;hajj&quot; pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has had five-year &quot;Development Plans&quot; since 1970. Among its plans were to launch &quot;economic cities&quot; (e.g. King Abdullah Economic City) in an effort to diversify the economy and provide jobs. The cities will be spread around Saudi Arabia to promote diversification for each region and their economy, and the cities are projected to contribute $150 billion to the GDP.

Saudi Arabia is increasingly activating its ports in order to participate in trade between Europe and China in addition to oil transport. To this end, ports such as Jeddah Islamic Port or King Abdullah Economic City are being rapidly expanded, and investments are being made in logistics. The country is historically and currently part of the Maritime Silk Road.

Statistics on poverty in the kingdom are not available through the UN resources because the Saudi government does not issue any. The Saudi state discourages calling attention to or complaining about poverty. In December 2011, the Saudi interior ministry arrested three reporters and held them for almost two weeks for questioning after they uploaded a video on the topic to YouTube. Authors of the video claim that 22% of Saudis may be considered poor. Observers researching the issue prefer to stay anonymous because of the risk of being arrested.

The unexpected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, along with Saudi Arabia&#x27;s poor human rights records, laid unforeseen challenges before the development plans of the kingdom, where some of the programmes under &#x27;Vision 2030&#x27; were also expected to be affected. In May 2020, the Finance Minister of Saudi Arabia admitted that the country&#x27;s economy was facing a severe economical crisis for the first time in decades, because of the pandemic as well as declining global oil markets. Mohammed Al-Jadaan said that the country will take &quot;painful&quot; measures and keep all options open to deal with the impact.

In July 2024 Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Renewable Energy Localisation Company (RELC) has formed three joint ventures with Chinese companies to advance the kingdom&#x27;s clean energy infrastructure. As part of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s 2030 targets, the Public Investment Fund is actively promoting the localization of renewable energy components. RELC, a division of the sovereign fund, facilitates partnerships between global manufacturers and Saudi private sector firms to strengthen local supply chains. The joint ventures include partnerships with Envision Energy for wind turbine components, Jinko Solar for photovoltaic cells, and Lumetech for solar photovoltaic ingots and wafers. These initiatives aim to localize up to 75% of the components used in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s renewable projects by 2030, positioning the country as a major global exporter of renewable technologies.

Saudi Minister of Economy and Planning, Faisal Al Ibrahim, emphasized Saudi Arabia&#x27;s progress in global climate goals at the 2024 High-Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development in New York, citing over 80 initiatives and investments exceeding $180 billion for the country&#x27;s green economy, as reported by Saudi Gazette. He highlighted the alignment of these efforts with Vision 2030 objectives, focusing on local sustainability, sector integration, and societal advancement.

=== Agriculture ===

Initial attempts to develop dairy farming on a commercial scale occurred in the Al Kharj District (just south of Riyadh) during the 1950s. Serious large-scale agricultural development began in the 1970s, particularly with wheat. The government launched an extensive programme to promote modern farming technology; to establish rural roads, irrigation networks and storage and export facilities; and to encourage agricultural research and training institutions. As a result, there has been a phenomenal growth in the production of all basic foods. Saudi Arabia is self-sufficient in numerous foodstuffs, including meat, milk, and eggs. The country exports dates, dairy products, eggs, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Dates, once a staple of the Saudi diet, are now mainly grown for global humanitarian aid.In addition, Saudi farmers grow substantial amounts of other grains such as barley, sorghum, and millet. As of 2016, in the interest of preserving precious water resources, domestic production of wheat, which it used to export, ended. Consuming non-renewable groundwater resulted in the loss of an estimated four-fifths of the total groundwater reserves by 2012.

The kingdom has some of the most modern and largest dairy farms in the Middle East. Milk production boasts a remarkably productive annual rate of per cow, one of the highest in the world. The local dairy manufacturing company Almarai is the largest vertically integrated dairy company in the Middle East.

The olive tree is indigenous to Saudi Arabia. The Al Jouf region has millions of olive trees, and the number is expected to increase to 20 million trees.

As part of the country&#x27;s ongoing plan to plant 100 Mangrove seedlings along its coastlines, the National Centre for Vegetation Cover Development and Combating Desertification has announced that it has planted 13M seedlings.

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
One of the main challenges for Saudi Arabia is water scarcity. Substantial investments have been undertaken in seawater desalination, water distribution, sewerage and wastewater treatment. Today about 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater, and 10% from surface water in the mountainous southwest of the country. Saudi Arabia is suffering from a major depletion of the water in its underground aquifers and a resultant break down and disintegration of its agriculture as a consequence. As a result of the catastrophe, Saudi Arabia has bought agricultural land in the United States, Argentina, and Africa. Saudi Arabia ranked as a major buyer of agricultural land in foreign countries.

According to the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation of the WHO and UNICEF, the latest reliable source on access to water and sanitation in Saudi Arabia is the 2004 census. It indicates that 97% of the population had access to an improved source of drinking water and 99% had access to improved sanitation. For 2015, the JMP estimates that access to sanitation increased to 100%. Sanitation was primarily through on-site solutions, and about 40% of the population was connected to sewers. In 2015, 886,000 people lacked access to &quot;improved&quot; water.

=== Tourism ===

In 2019, Saudi Arabia adopted a general tourism travel visa to allow non-Muslims to visit. Although most tourism largely involves religious pilgrimages, there is growth in the leisure tourism sector. According to the World Bank, approximately 14.3 million people visited Saudi Arabia in 2012, making it the world&#x27;s 19th-most-visited country. Tourism is an important component of the Saudi Vision 2030, and according to a report conducted by BMI Research in 2018 both religious and non-religious tourism have significant potential for expansion.

The kingdom offers an electronic visa for foreign visitors to attend sports events and concerts. In 2019, the kingdom announced its plans to open visa applications for visitors, where people from about 50 countries would be able to get tourist visas to Saudi. In 2020 it was announced that holders of a US, UK or Schengen visa are eligible for a Saudi electronic visa upon arrival.

== Demographics ==


Saudi Arabia&#x27;s reported population is 32,175,224 as of 2022, making it the fourth most populous country in the Arab world. Close to 42% of its inhabitants are immigrants, mostly from the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.

The Saudi population has grown rapidly since 1950, when it was estimated at 3 million. For much of the 20th century, the country had one of the highest population growth rates in the world, at around 3% annually; it continues to grow at a rate of 1.62% per year, slightly higher than the rest of the Middle East and North Africa. Consequently, the Saudi people are quite young by global standards, with over half the population under 25 years old.

The ethnic composition of Saudi citizens is 90% Arab and 10% Afro-Arab. Most Saudis are concentrated in the southwest; Hejaz, which is the most populated region, is home to one-third of the population, followed by neighbouring Najd (28%) and the Eastern Province (15%). As late as 1970, most Saudis lived a subsistence life in the rural provinces, but in the last half of the 20th century, the kingdom has urbanized rapidly: as of 2023, about 85% of Saudis live in urban metropolitan areas—specifically Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. As recently as the early 1960s, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s slave population was estimated at . Slavery was officially abolished in 1962.

=== Language ===
The official language is Arabic. There are four main regional dialect groups spoken by Saudis: Najdi (about 14.6 million speakers), Hejazi (about 10.3 million speakers), Gulf (about 0.96 million speakers) including Baharna dialects, and Southern Hejaz and Tihama dialects. Faifi is spoken by about . The Mehri language is also spoken by around Mehri citizens. Saudi Sign Language is the principal language of the deaf community, amounting to around speakers. The large expatriate communities also speak their own languages, the most numerous of which, according to 2018 data, are Bengali (~1 ), Tagalog (~), Punjabi (~), Urdu (~), Egyptian Arabic (~), Rohingya, North Levantine Arabic (both ~) and Malayalam.

=== Religion ===
Virtually all Saudi citizens and residents are Muslim; by law, all citizens of the country are Muslim. Estimates of the Sunni population range between 85% and 90%, with the remaining 10 to 15% being Shia Muslim, practicing either Twelver Shi&#x27;ism or Sulaymani Ismailism. The official and dominant form of Sunni Islam is Salafism, commonly known as Wahhabism, which was founded in the Arabian Peninsula by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab in the 18th century. Other denominations, such as the minority Shia Islam, are systematically suppressed. Shia Muslims in Saudi Arabia are largely found in the Eastern Province, particularly in Qatif and Al–Ahsa.

There are an estimated 1.5 million Christians in Saudi Arabia, almost all foreign workers. Saudi Arabia allows Christians to enter the country as temporary foreign workers but does not allow them to practice their faith openly. There are officially no Saudi citizens who are Christians, as Saudi Arabia forbids religious conversion from Islam (apostasy) and punishes it by death. According to the Pew Research, there are Hindus in Saudi Arabia, almost all foreign workers. There may be a significant fraction of atheists and agnostics, although they are officially called &quot;terrorists&quot;. In its 2017 religious freedom report, the U.S. State Department named Saudi Arabia a Country of Particular Concern, denoting systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.

Najran was once home to historical local Christian and Jewish communities. Prior to establishment of Israel, Najran was home to over 7,000 Jews. The Jews of Najran are predominantly of Yemenite Jewish background. Following the establishment of Israel and the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, Jews began leaving for Yemen and from there headed to Israel. By the 1970s, there were no Jews left in the country.

=== Education ===
Education is free at all levels, although higher education is restricted to citizens only. The school system is composed of elementary, intermediate, and secondary schools. Classes are segregated by sex. At the secondary level, students are able to choose from three types of schools: general education, vocational and technical, or religious. The rate of literacy is 99% among males and 96% among females in 2020. Youth literacy rose to approximately 99.5% for both sexes.

Higher education has expanded rapidly, with large numbers of universities and colleges being founded particularly since 2000. Institutions of higher education include King Saud University at Riyadh, the Islamic University at Medina, and the King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah. Princess Norah University is the largest women&#x27;s university in the world. King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, known as KAUST, is the first mixed-gender university campus in Saudi Arabia and was founded in 2009. Other colleges and universities emphasize curricula in sciences and technology, military studies, religion, and medicine. Institutes devoted to Islamic studies, in particular, abound. Women typically receive college instruction in segregated institutions.

The &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot;, known as Shanghai Ranking, ranked five Saudi institutions among its 2022 list of the 500 top universities in the world. The QS World University Rankings lists 14 Saudi universities among the 2022 world&#x27;s top universities and 23 universities among the top 100 in the Arab world. The 2022 list of U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking ranked King Abdulaziz University among the top 50 universities in the world and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology among the top 100 universities in the world.

In 2018, Saudi Arabia ranked 28th worldwide in terms of high-quality research output according to the scientific journal &quot;Nature.&quot;
This makes Saudi Arabia the best performing Middle Eastern, Arab, and Muslim country. Saudi Arabia spends 8.8% of its gross domestic product on education, compared with the global average of 4.6%. Saudi Arabia was ranked 44th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, up from 68th in 2019.

The Saudi education system has been accused of encouraging Islamic terrorism, leading to reform efforts. Following the 9/11 attacks, the government aimed to tackle the twin problems of encouraging extremism and the inadequacy of the country&#x27;s university education for a modern economy, by slowly modernizing the education system through the &quot;Tatweer&quot; reform programme. The Tatweer programme is reported to have a budget of approximately US$2 billion and focuses on moving teaching away from the traditional Saudi methods of memorization and rote learning towards encouraging students to analyse and problem-solve. It also aims to create an education system which will provide a more secular and vocationally based training.

In 2021, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported on the measures taken by Saudi Arabia to clean textbooks from paragraphs considered antisemitic and sexist. The paragraphs dealing with the punishment of homosexuality or same-sex relations have been deleted, as well as the expressions of admiration for the extremist martyrdom. Antisemitic expressions and calls to fight the Jews became fewer. David Weinberg, director of international affairs for the Anti-Defamation League, said that references to demonizing Jews, Christians, and Shiites have been removed from some places or have toned down. The U.S. State Department expressed in an e-mail that it welcomed the changes. The Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs supports a training programme for Saudi teachers.

=== Health care ===

Saudi Arabia has a national health care system in which the government provides free health care services through government agencies. Saudi Arabia has been ranked among the 26 best countries in providing high quality healthcare. The Ministry of Health is the major government agency entrusted with the provision of preventive, curative, and rehabilitative health care. The ministry&#x27;s origins can be traced to 1925, when several regional health departments were established, with the first in Makkah. The various healthcare institutions were merged to become a ministerial body in 1950. The Health Ministry created a friendly competition between each of the districts and between different medical services and hospitals. This idea resulted in the creation of the &quot;Ada&#x27;a&quot; project launched in 2016. The new system is a nationwide performance indicator, for services and hospitals. Waiting times and other major measurements improved dramatically across the kingdom.

A new strategy has been developed by the ministry, known as Diet and Physical Activity Strategy or DPAS for short, to address bad lifestyle choices. The ministry advised that there should be a tax increase on unhealthy food, drink, and cigarettes. This additional tax could be used to improve healthcare offerings. The tax was implemented in 2017. As part of the same strategy, calorie labels were added in 2019 to some food and drink products. Ingredients were also listed as an aim to reduce obesity and inform citizens with health issues to manage their diet. As part of the ongoing focus on tackling obesity, women-only gyms were allowed to open in 2017. Sports offered in each of these gyms include bodybuilding, running and swimming to maintain higher standards of health.

Smoking in all age groups is widespread. In 2009 the lowest median percentage of smokers was university students (~13.5%) while the highest was elderly people (~25%). The study also found the median percentage of male smokers to be much higher than that of females (~26.5% for males, ~9% for females). Before 2010, Saudi Arabia had no policies banning or restricting smoking.

The MOH has been awarded &quot;Healthy City&quot; certificates by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the cities of Unayzah and Riyadh Al Khabra as 4th and 5th Healthy Cities in Saudi Arabia.
The WHO had earlier classified three Saudi Arabian cities, Ad Diriyah, Jalajil, and Al-Jamoom as &quot;Healthy city&quot;, as part of the WHO Healthy Cities Programme. Recently Al-Baha has also been classified as a healthy city to join the list of global healthy cities approved by the World Health Organization.

In May 2019, the then Saudi Minister of Health Tawfiq bin Fawzan AlRabiah received a global award on behalf of the Kingdom for combatting smoking through social awareness, treatment, and application of regulations. The award was presented as part of the 72nd session of the World Health Assembly, held in Geneva in May 2019. After becoming one of the first nations to ratify the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2005, it plans to reduce tobacco use from 12.7% in 2017, to 5% in 2030.

Saudi Arabia has a life expectancy of 78 years (77 for males and 80 for females) according to the latest data for the year 2022 from the World Bank. Infant mortality in 2022 was 6 per 1000 (6 for males and 5 for females) . In 2022, 71.8% of the adult population was overweight and 40.6% was obese.

=== Foreigners ===
The Central Department of Statistics &amp; Information estimated the foreign population at the end of 2014 at 33% (10.1 million). The CIA Factbook estimated that foreign nationals living in Saudi Arabia made up about 21% of the population. Other sources report differing estimates. Indian: 1.5 million, Pakistani: 1.3 million, Egyptian: , Yemeni: , Bangladeshi: , Filipino: , Jordanian/Palestinian: , Indonesian: , Sri Lankan: , Sudanese: , Syrian: and Turkish: .

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, there were more than half a million foreign-born domestic workers. Most have backgrounds in poverty and come from Africa, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. To go to work in Saudi Arabia, they must often pay large sums to recruitment agencies in their home countries. The agencies then handle the necessary legal paperwork.

As the Saudi population grows and oil export revenues stagnate, pressure for &quot;Saudization&quot; (the replacement of foreign workers with Saudis) has grown, and the Saudi government hopes to decrease the number of foreign nationals in the country. Saudi Arabia expelled Yemenis in 1990 and 1991 and has built a Saudi–Yemen barrier against an influx of illegal immigrants and against the smuggling of drugs and weapons. In November 2013, Saudi Arabia expelled thousands of illegal Ethiopian residents from the kingdom. Various Human Rights entities have criticized Saudi Arabia&#x27;s handling of the issue.

Over undocumented migrant workers—mostly from Somalia, Ethiopia, and Yemen—have been detained and deported since 2013. An investigation led by &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, exposed the condition of African migrants who were detained in Saudi Arabia allegedly for containing COVID-19 in the kingdom. They were beaten, tortured, and electrocuted. Many of the migrants died due to heatstroke or by attempting suicide, after being severely beaten and tortured. The migrants lack proper living conditions, provision of food and water.

Foreigners cannot apply for permanent residency, though a specialized Premium Residency visa became available in 2019. Only Muslims can become Saudi citizens. Foreigners who have resided in the kingdom and hold degrees in various scientific fields may apply for Saudi citizenship, and exception made for Palestinians who are excluded unless married to a male Saudi national, because of Arab League instructions barring the Arab states from granting them citizenship. Saudi Arabia is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention.

== Culture ==


Saudi Arabia has millennia-old attitudes and traditions, often derived from Arab civilization. Some of the major factors that influence the culture are Islamic heritage and Arab traditions as well as its historical role as an ancient trade centre. The Kingdom also has a very family-oriented culture with an emphasis on preserving family traditions and kinship ties.

=== Religion in society ===
Religion is a core aspect of everyday life in Saudi Arabia; it plays a dominant role in the country&#x27;s governance and legal system, and deeply influences culture and daily life, although the power of the religious establishment has been significantly eroded in the 2010s. The Hejaz region, where the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina are located, is the destination of the Ḥajj pilgrimage, and often deemed to be the cradle of Islam.

Islam is the state religion of Saudi Arabia. There is no law that requires all citizens to be Muslim, but non-Muslims and many foreign and Saudi Muslims whose beliefs are deemed not to conform with the government&#x27;s interpretation of Islam must practice their religion in private and are vulnerable to discrimination, harassment, detention, and, for foreigners, deportation. Neither Saudi citizens nor guest workers have the right of freedom of religion. The dominant form of Islam in the kingdom—Wahhabism—arose in the central region of Najd, in the 18th century. Proponents call the movement &quot;Salafism&quot;, and believe that its teachings purify the practice of Islam of innovations or practices that deviate from the seventh-century teachings of Muhammad and his companions. The Saudi government has often been viewed as an active oppressor of Shia Muslims because of the funding of the Wahhabi ideology which denounces the Shia faith. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi ambassador to the United States, stated: &quot;The time is not far off in the Middle East when it will be literally &#x27;God help the Shia&#x27;. More than a billion Sunnis have simply had enough of them.&quot;

Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries that have &quot;religious police&quot; (known as &quot;Haia&quot; or &quot;Mutaween&quot;), who patrol the streets &quot;enjoining good and forbidding wrong&quot; by enforcing dress codes, strict separation of men and women, attendance at prayer (&quot;salat&quot;) five times each day, the ban on alcohol, and other aspects of &quot;Sharia.&quot; However, since 2016 the power of religious police was curbed, which barred them from pursuing, questioning, requesting identification or arresting suspects. In the privacy of homes, behaviour can be far looser, and reports from WikiLeaks indicate that low ranked members of the ruling Saudi Royal family indulge in parties with alcohol, drugs, and prostitutes.

=== Women in society ===
Throughout history, women did not have equal rights to men in the kingdom; the U.S. State Department considers Saudi Arabian government&#x27;s discrimination against women a &quot;significant problem&quot; and notes that women have few political rights because of the government&#x27;s discriminatory policies. However, since Mohammed bin Salman was appointed Crown Prince in 2017, a series of social reforms have been witnessed regarding women&#x27;s rights.

Under previous Saudi law, all females were required to have a male guardian (), typically a father, brother, husband, or uncle (). In 2019, this law was partially amended to exclude women over 21 years old from the requirement of a male guardian. The amendment also granted women rights in relation to the guardianship of minor children. Previously, girls and women were forbidden from travelling, conducting official business, or undergoing certain medical procedures without permission from their male guardians. In 2019, Saudi Arabia allowed women to travel abroad, register for divorce or marriage, and apply for official documents without the permission of a male guardian.

In 2006, Wajeha al-Huwaider, a leading Saudi feminist and journalist said &quot;Saudi women are weak, no matter how high their status, even the &#x27;pampered&#x27; ones among them, because they have no law to protect them from attack by anyone.&quot; Following this, Saudi Arabia implemented the anti-domestic violence law in 2014. Furthermore, between 2017 and 2020, the country addressed issues of mobility, sexual harassment, pensions, and employment-discrimination protections. al-Huwaider and other female activists have applauded the general direction in which the country was headed.

Women face discrimination in the courts, where the testimony of one man equals that of two women in family and inheritance law. Polygamy is permitted for men, and men have a unilateral right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. However, in 2022, women were granted the right to divorce and without the approval of a legal guardian under the new Personal Status Law. With regard to the law of inheritance, the Quran specifies that fixed portions of the deceased&#x27;s estate must be left to the &quot;Qur&#x27;anic heirs&quot; and generally, female heirs receive half the portion of male heirs.

=== Heritage sites ===

Saudi Wahhabism is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to &#x27;shirk&#x27; (idolatry), and the most significant historic Muslim sites (in Mecca and Medina) are located in the western Saudi region of the Hejaz. As a consequence, under Saudi rule an estimated 95% of Mecca&#x27;s historic buildings, most over a thousand years old, have been demolished for religious reasons. Critics claim that over the last 50 years, 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad, his family or companions have been lost, leaving fewer than 20 structures remaining in Mecca that date back to the time of Muhammad. Demolished structures include the mosque originally built by Muhammad&#x27;s daughter Fatima, and other mosques founded by Abu Bakr (Muhammad&#x27;s father-in-law and the first caliph), Umar (the second caliph), Ali (Muhammad&#x27;s son-in-law and the fourth caliph), and Salman al-Farsi (another of Muhammad&#x27;s companions).Seven cultural sites in Saudi Arabia are designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Al-Hijr Archaeological Site (Madâin Sâlih); the Turaif district in Diriyah; Historic Jeddah, the Gate to Mecca; Al-Ahsa Oasis; Rock Art in the Hail Region; Ḥimā Cultural Area; and &#x27;Uruq Bani Ma&#x27;arid. Ten other sites submitted requests for recognition to UNESCO in 2015. There are six elements inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list: Al-Qatt Al-Asiri, female traditional interior wall decoration in Asir; Almezmar, drumming and dancing with sticks; Falconry, a living human heritage; Arabic coffee, a symbol of generosity; Majlis, a cultural and social space; Alardah Alnajdiyah, dance, drumming and poetry in Saudi Arabia.

In June 2014, the Council of Ministers approved a law that gives the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage the means to protect Saudi Arabia&#x27;s ancient relics and historic sites. Within the framework of the 2016 National Transformation Programme, also known as Saudi Vision 2030, the kingdom allocated 900 million euros to preserve its historical and cultural heritage. Saudi Arabia also participates in the International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas, created in March 2017, with a contribution of 18.5 million euros.

In 2017, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman promised to return Saudi Arabia to the &quot;moderate Islam&quot; of the era before the 1979 Iranian revolution. A new centre, the King Salman Complex for the Prophet&#x27;s Hadith, was established that year to monitor interpretations of the Prophet Mohammed&#x27;s hadiths to prevent them being used to justifying terrorism.

In March 2018, the Crown Prince met the Archbishop of Canterbury during a visit to the UK, pledging to promote interfaith dialogue. In Riyadh the following month King Salman met the head of the Vatican&#x27;s Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue. In July 2019, UNESCO signed a letter with the Saudi Minister of Culture in which Saudi Arabia contributed US$25 million to UNESCO for the preservation of heritage.

On November 5, 2024, archeologists published the news of an ancient city discovered within in the Saudi oasis of Khaybar. The city named al-Natah, that dates back some 4,000 years, was inhabited during the Bronze Age around 2,400 BC, and had about 500 houses. Not far, a cluster of graves was found, within them metal weapons.

=== Dress ===

Saudi Arabian dress strictly follows the principles of hijab (the Islamic principle of modesty, especially in dress). The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering, garments are suited to Saudi Arabia&#x27;s desert climate. Traditionally, men usually wear a white ankle-length garment woven from wool or cotton (known as a thawb), with a keffiyeh (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by an agal) or a ghutra (a plain white square made of a finer cotton, also held in place by an agal) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a camel-hair cloak (bisht) over the top. In public women are required to wear a black abaya or other black clothing that covers everything under the neck with the exception of their hands and feet, although most women cover their head in respect of their religion. This requirement applies to non-Muslim women too and failure to abide can result in police action, particularly in more conservative areas of the country. Women&#x27;s clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques.

=== Arts and entertainment ===

During the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the kingdom although they were seen as contrary to Wahhabi norms. During the Islamic revival movement in the 1980s, and as a political response to an increase in Islamist activism including the 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, the government closed all cinemas and theatres. However, with King Abdullah and King Salman&#x27;s reforms, cinemas re-opened, including one in KAUST.

From the 18th century onward, Wahhabi fundamentalism discouraged artistic development inconsistent with its teaching. In addition, Sunni Islamic prohibition of creating representations of people have limited the visual arts, which tend to be dominated by geometric, floral, and abstract designs and by calligraphy. With the advent of the oil-wealth in the 20th century came exposure to outside influences, such as Western housing styles, furnishings, and clothes. Music and dance have always been part of Saudi life. Traditional music is generally associated with poetry and is sung collectively. Instruments include the rabābah, an instrument not unlike a three-string fiddle, and various types of percussion instruments, such as the ṭabl (drum) and the ṭār (tambourine). The national dance is a native sword dance known as ardah. Originating from Najd, it involves lines or circles of men and singing poetry. Bedouin poetry, known as nabaṭī, is popular.

Censorship has limited the development of Saudi literature, although several Saudi novelists and poets have achieved critical and popular acclaim in the Arab world—albeit generating official hostility in their home country. These include Ghazi Algosaibi, Mansour al-Nogaidan, Abdelrahman Munif, Turki al-Hamad, and Rajaa al-Sanea. In 2016, the General Entertainment Authority (GEA) was formed to oversee the expansion of the Saudi entertainment sector.
The first concerts in Riyadh for 25 years took place the following year. Other events since the GEA&#x27;s creation have included comedy shows, professional wrestling events, and monster truck rallies. In 2018 the first public cinema opened after a ban of 35 years, with plans to have more than screens running by 2030.

Developments in the arts in 2018 included Saudi Arabia&#x27;s debut appearances at the Cannes Film Festival and the Venice Biennale.

=== TV and media ===

Television was introduced in Saudi Arabia in 1954. Saudi Arabia is a major market for pan-Arab satellite and pay-TV. It controls the largest share of the pan-Arab broadcasting market; among the major Saudi-owned broadcasting companies are the Middle East Broadcasting Centre, Rotana, and the Saudi Broadcasting Authority. The Saudi government closely monitors media and restricts it under official state law. Changes have been made to lessen these restrictions; however, some government-led efforts to control information have also drawn international attention. As of 2022, Reporters Without Borders rates the kingdom&#x27;s press a &quot;very serious&quot; situation.

Most of the early newspapers in the Persian Gulf region were established in Saudi Arabia. The first newspaper founded in the country and in the Persian Gulf area is &quot;Al Fallah&quot;, which was launched in 1920, and the first English-language newspaper is &quot;Arab News&quot;, which was launched in 1975. All of the newspapers published in Saudi Arabia are privately owned.

According to World Bank, as of 2020, 98% of the population of Saudi Arabia are internet users which puts it in the 8th rank among countries with the highest percentage of internet users. Saudi Arabia has one of the fastest 5G internet speeds in the world. The kingdom is the 27th largest market for e-commerce with a revenue of US$8 billion in 2021.

=== Cuisine ===

Saudi Arabian cuisine is similar to that of the surrounding countries in the Arabian Peninsula and the wider Arab world, and has influenced and been influenced by Turkish, Indian, Persian, and African food. Islamic dietary laws are enforced: pork is not allowed, and other animals are slaughtered in accordance with halal. Kebabs and falafel are popular, as is shawarma, a marinated grilled meat dish of lamb, mutton, or chicken. Kabsa, a rice dish with lamb, chicken, fish, or shrimp, is among the national dishes as is mandi. Flat, unleavened taboon bread is a staple of virtually every meal, as are dates, fresh fruit, yoghurt, and hummus. Coffee, served in the Arabic style, is the traditional beverage, but tea and various fruit juices are popular as well. The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree is from the 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of Arabia.

=== Sport ===
Football is the national sport in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabia national football team is considered one of Asia&#x27;s most successful national teams, having reached a joint record six AFC Asian Cup finals, winning three of those finals (1984, 1988, and 1996) and having qualified for the World Cup four consecutive times ever since debuting at the 1994 tournament. In the 1994 FIFA World Cup under the leadership of Jorge Solari, Saudi Arabia beat both Belgium and Morocco in the group stage before failing to defeat Sweden in the round of 16. During the 1992 FIFA Confederations Cup, which was played in Saudi Arabia, the country reached the final, losing 1–3 to Argentina.

Scuba diving, windsurfing, sailing, and basketball (which is played by both men and women) are also popular with the Saudi Arabian national basketball team winning bronze at the 1999 Asian Championship. More traditional sports such as horse racing and camel racing are also popular. The annual King&#x27;s Camel Race, begun in 1974, is one of the sport&#x27;s most important contests and attracts animals and riders from throughout the region. Falconry is another traditional pursuit.
Women&#x27;s sport is controversial because of the suppression of female participation in sport by conservative Islamic religious authorities, however the restrictions have eased. Until 2018 women were not permitted in sport stadiums. Segregated seating, allowing women to enter, has been developed in three stadiums across major cities. Since 2020, the progress of women&#x27;s integration into the Saudi sport scene began to develop rapidly. 25 Saudi sport federations established a national women&#x27;s team, including a national football and basketball team. In November 2020, the Saudi Arabian Football Federation announced the launch of the first nationwide Saudi women&#x27;s premier league.

In its vision for modernization, the nation has introduced many international sporting events, bringing sports stars to the kingdom. However, in August 2019, the kingdom&#x27;s strategy received criticism for appearing as a method of sportswashing soon after Saudi&#x27;s US-based 2018 lobbying campaign foreign registration documentations got published online. The documents showed Saudi Arabia as allegedly implementing a sportswashing strategy, including meetings and official calls with authorities of associations like Major League Soccer, World Wrestling Entertainment, and the National Basketball Association.

Saudi has made a bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup and developments of stadiums to be used for the event are ongoing. There are reportedly 11 new stadiums being built and airports are scheduled to be expanded to accommodate the expected influx of passengers. 0n December 2024, Saudi Arabia was confirmed as host of the 2034 World Cup.

<doc id="349306" wikidata="Q537323" url="?curid=349306" title="Loughborough">
<text>Loughborough ( ) is a market town in the Charnwood Borough of Leicestershire, England; it is the administrative centre of Charnwood Borough Council. At the United Kingdom 2021 census, the town&#x27;s built-up area had a population of 64,884.

It is the second largest settlement in the county after Leicester. Loughborough is close to the Nottinghamshire border and is at an equal distance to Leicester, Nottingham, Derby and the East Midlands Airport. Loughborough is also home to the world&#x27;s largest bell foundry, John Taylor Bellfounders, which produced Great Paul at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral; it has also made bells for the Carillon War Memorial, a landmark in Queens Park.

==History==
===Medieval===
The earliest reference to Loughborough occurs in the Domesday Book of 1086, which calls it &quot;Lucteburne&quot;. It appears as &quot;Lucteburga&quot; in a charter from the reign of Henry II, and as &quot;Luchteburc&quot; in the Pipe Rolls of 1186. The name is of Old English origin and means &quot;Luhhede&#x27;s &quot;burh&quot; or fortified place&quot;.

Loughborough Grammar School was established in 1495, by money left in the will of Thomas Burton, a wealthy local wool merchant.

===Industrialisation===
The first sign of industrialisation in the district came in the early 19th century, when John Heathcoat, an inventor from Derbyshire, patented in 1809 an improvement to the warp loom, known as the twisted lace machine, which allowed mitts with a lace-like appearance to be made.

Heathcoat, in partnership with the Nottingham manufacturer Charles Lacy, moved his business from there to the village of Hathern, outside Loughborough. The product of this &quot;Loughborough machine&quot; came to be known as English net or bobbinet. However, the factory was attacked in 1816 by Luddites thought to be in the pay of Nottingham competitors and 55 frames were destroyed. This prompted Heathcoat to move his business to a disused wool mill in Tiverton, Devon.

In 1888 a charter of incorporation was obtained, allowing a mayor and corporation to be elected. The population increased from 11,000 to 25,000 in the following ten years.

Among the factories established were Robert Taylor&#x27;s bell foundry John Taylor &amp; Co and the Falcon works, which produced steam locomotives, then motor cars, before it was taken over by Brush Electrical Machines. In 1897, Herbert Morris set up a factory in the Empress Works in Moor Lane which become one of the foremost crane manufacturers by the mid-20th century.

There was also strong municipal investment: a new sewage works in 1895, then a waterworks in Blackbrook and a power station in Bridge Street in 1899. The corporation took over the Loughborough Gas Company in 1900.

===Tourism===
In 1841, Loughborough was the destination for the first package tour, organised by Thomas Cook for a temperance group from Leicester.

===Modern history===
As Loughborough grew in the 20th century, it gained new suburbs. Thorpe Acre in the north-west of Loughborough was a hamlet of about twenty dwellings until the mid-20th century. Several earlier survivors include a 19th-century church – All Saints Church, Thorpe Acre with Dishley, built in 1845 and extended in 1968 – and a hostelry, &quot;The Plough Inn&quot;. The population is counted into the Loughborough–Garendon Ward of Charnwood Council. Many roads there are named after poets. After World War II, some of Thorpe Acre developed further, mainly in the 1950s for employees of Brush Engineering Works, with 100 dwellings built of no-fines concrete. In the 1960s and early 1970s, Thorpe Acre gained a new estate that subsumed the old village. Two of Loughborough&#x27;s secondary schools, Charnwood College and De Lisle College, lie on its bounds, as does Garendon Park, a large deer park from the 18th century. The original Dishley, off Derby Road, was heavily developed along with Thorpe Acre in the 1970s. Dishley Church in Derby Road is now in ruins. The agriculturalist Robert Bakewell (1726–1795) is buried there.

Shelthorpe and surrounding area are new suburbs in the south of Loughborough. Work on the original Shelthorpe started in 1929, but was halted by World War II and resumed in 1946. The centre of Shelthorpe has a wide variety of shops, including a Tesco Extra, which is probably the largest supermarket in Loughborough.

The Hazel Road and Fairmeadows Way estates to the west of Shelthorpe and the south of the university date from the 1970s. They stretch from Holywell Drive to Hazel Road. Rainbows Hospice, a children&#x27;s hospice, and the secondary Woodbrook Vale School are on the edge of the suburb. They were followed by the Haddon Way estates to the south of the estates, and then by Grange Park, just south of Shelthorpe and north-west of the hamlet of Woodthorpe, whose construction began in 2006 after completion of Terry Yardley Way to One Ash Roundabout, the last phase of Loughborough&#x27;s A6004 ring road.

A planning application to build 30 new homes by William Davis Homes came under criticism in 2018 from residents saying that they had been promised public amenities like shops and a place of worship, but were living on &quot;a construction site&quot;; the site was originally intended to have shops, a church, community centre and health centre built on it. Despite the criticism, Charnwood Borough Council approved the plans.

After hosting two successful vegan markets in 2022, Charnwood Borough Council initiated three vegan markets to be held in Market Place in March, May, and October 2023.

== Demographics ==
At the 2021 census, Loughborough&#x27;s urban area had a population of 64,884. Of the findings, the ethnicity and religious composition of the ward was:

The religious composition of the ward at the 2021 Census was recorded as:

=== Climate ===

Like most of the British Isles, Loughborough experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is at Sutton Bonington in Nottinghamshire, located 5 miles due north of the town centre. The highest temperature recorded in that area was on 25 July 2019.

==Economy==

The centre of Loughborough&#x27;s shopping area is the pedestrianised Market Place and Market Street, which maintain several original art deco buildings, such as the building that currently houses the town&#x27;s Odeon cinema. A large outdoor market is held in the Market Place every Thursday and Saturday. There is a monthly farmers&#x27; market. The first mention of a market in Loughborough is in 1221.

The Rushes shopping centre has also been built on the site of the former bus station and is occupied by national chains. The Rushes is linked to the town centre area by Churchgate and Churchgate Mews; the latter has independent shops.

A major new development, the Eastern Gateway, which developed the area around the railway station with a new road and new housing, was completed in 2013 for £20 million.

Pedestrianisation of the town centre was completed in November 2014. The scheme is intended to improve the economy within the town centre and reduce pollution from traffic congestion.

A new Cineworld cinema complex with several restaurants on Baxter Gate, on the site of the former General Hospital, was completed in 2016.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Loughborough is the mainline station that serves the town. In 2012, Network Rail redeveloped the station increasing the length of the platforms and improving access; concurrently, the local council made improvements to the surrounding area.

East Midlands Railway operates all passenger services that serve the station, on two routes:
* The Midland Main Line between London St Pancras, Nottingham and Sheffield; intermediate locations include Derby, Leicester, Market Harborough and Kettering. The link to London is half-hourly and provides a link to Europe, via Eurostar. Leicester and Derby stations allow transfers to CrossCountry trains running between the north-east of Scotland and the south-west of England.
* Services between Leicester and Lincoln; alternate services continue to or .

At one time, there were three railway routes to the town: the still-operating Midland Main Line, the Great Central Railway that closed as a result of the Beeching cuts, and a branch line from Nuneaton that was part of the London &amp; North Western Railway. Rws | Loughborough Central served the Great Central Railway. It was opened on 15 March 1899 and closed in 1969.

====Heritage====
Loughborough Central re-opened in March 1974 as part of the Great Central heritage railway. 
The railway is split into two sections north and south of Loughborough. Central station is the northern terminus of the southern section of the railway and services run daily. As of 2017, there were plans to fill the gap, known as the Loughborough Gap, and link the two halves of the railway again. Thus, a new bridge was installed over the Midland Main Line, the A60 and the Grand Union Canal. Work is now progressing on restoring another bridge over the car park of an industrial estate. 

Brush Traction, a manufacturer of railway locomotives, is also located in the town, adjacent to the Midland railway station.

===Roads===
Loughborough sits at the crossroads of three main roads, two of which begin in the town:
* The A6 main road begins at Luton before running north through Bedford, Leicester, Derby, Manchester and ending at Carlisle.
* The A60 begins in Loughborough and goes north to Nottingham, Mansfield and Worksop. 
* The A512 begins in Loughborough and runs west towards the M1, Shepshed and Ashby-de-la-Zouch, while the A6004, which was originally proposed as a bypass for Loughborough, runs from just south of the town around the western and northern suburbs of Loughborough, ending near the railway station at the A60.

Other signed routes are the B589, running between the A6 and the A60, and the B5350, running between the A6 and the A6004.

The M1&#x27;s junction 23 lies just to the west of Loughborough. The north of the town can be accessed from junction 24, travelling through Kegworth and Hathern on the A6 road and the south-west of the town from Junction 22, via Copt Oak and the small hamlet of Nanpantan.

===Buses===
Bus services in and around Loughborough are operated by Arriva Midlands East, Kinchbus, Diamond East Midlands, Centrebus, Nottingham City Transport and Vectare.

Buses around Loughborough town centre depart from on-street stops on various streets around the town centre. Until around 2001, some routes were operated from a bus station near Fennel Street, but this was demolished as part of a town centre regeneration; &quot;The Rushes&quot; shopping centre was built on the site.

===Waterways===
The River Soar passes by to the east of the town. Navigation north towards the Trent was achieved in 1778 by the &quot;Loughborough Navigation&quot;, which terminates at Loughborough Wharf between Derby Road and Bridge Street. Subsequently, the Leicester Navigation was constructed, connecting to the Loughborough Navigation at Chain Bridge and to the River Soar south of the town. Both form part of the Grand Union Canal.

The now-derelict Charnwood Forest Canal once linked Nanpantan (on the west side of Loughborough) with Thringstone, with goods being carried into the town by a horse-drawn wagonway.

In 2008 it was named Sunday Times University of the Year.

====Loughborough College====
Loughborough College is the second biggest education establishment in Loughborough, after the University. It offers further education and vocational courses. It was established in 1909, and has over 12,000 full and part-time students.

====RNIB College, Loughborough====
RNIB College, Loughborough, caters for those over 16 with a wide range of disabilities, seeking access to education, employment and independent living.

===Uniformed youth organisations===

The university is home to the ECB National Cricket Academy, used by the England team as their primary training centre.

The town rugby union club, Loughborough RFC, play at Derby Road playing fields. The club was formed in 1891.

=== Arts and heritage ===

Loughborough has five museums, the largest being the centrally located Charnwood Museum, which houses a range of exhibits reflecting the natural history, geology, industry and history of the area. Nearby in Queens Park is the Carillon and War Memorial, home to a small museum of military memorabilia from the First and Second World Wars. Loughborough Library is on Granby Street.

Also to be found in the town centre, near the fine medieval All Saints parish church, is the Old Rectory. Dating back to 1288 the remaining portion of the Great Hall has been restored and houses a small museum run by the Loughborough Archaeological and Historical Society.

Loughborough has for more than a century been the home of John Taylor &amp; Co, bell founders. The firm&#x27;s Bellfoundry Museum on two floors tells the story of bell-making over the centuries. The recording of the tolling bell at the beginning of &quot;Hells Bells&quot;, the first track on AC/DC&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Back in Black&quot; was made on a quarter-weight near replica of the Denison bell in the Carillon war memorial.

There is a museum at the former Great Central Railway station, illustrating the history of the railway from its earliest days up to its present state as a double-track preserved heritage railway.

Although Loughborough has no dedicated art gallery, fine sculpture can be found in the town&#x27;s environs, including those installed from a local artist in commemoration of the First World War Centenary outside Charnwood Museum, and &quot;The Sockman&quot;, a bronze statue marking Loughborough&#x27;s association with the hosiery industry. This can be found in the Market Place near Loughborough Town Hall, which itself contains a number of art works. It is also the venue for concerts, exhibitions, musicals, comedy shows and a Christmas pantomime. Groups make use of the town hall for their shows.

Events are also organised by Charnwood Arts, a voluntarily managed and professionally staffed body offering a year-round programme of professional performances across the borough. They include the Picnic In the Park, inaugurated in 1980, which is held in Queens Park in May. Streets Alive, jointly organised by Charnwood Arts and Charnwood Borough Council, takes place at a similar time of year.

The Loughborough Canal Festival, which ran from 1997 to 2014, was an annual event in May centred on Chain Bridge.

Great Central Railway is a heritage railway based at Loughborough Central Station, which is south of the town centre. It is operated largely by volunteers. Trains run every weekend of the year and on bank holidays, as well as daily during the summer.

Every November, a street fair takes over the centre of the town, closing some roads. The fair runs from Wednesday afternoon until Saturday night and offers rides, amusement arcades, food stands and games. Fairs have been held in Loughborough for centuries, the first official Charter being granted to the Lord of the Manor, Hugh le Despencer, in 1221 by King Henry III. The Fair was then held on St. Peter&#x27;s Day.

The town has an Odeon cinema designed by Archibald Hurley Robinson in an Art Deco style. There are six screens. The cinema was built in 1914 as the Empire and was remodelled in 1936 by Hurley Robinson as the New Empire Cinema. Over the years it has been named the Palm Court and Ballroom, Empire, Essoldo, Classic, Curzon and Reel. The site of the former Loughborough General Hospital, demolished in 2012, was taken by a Cineworld cinema with eight screens, which opened in 2016 and closed in 2024.

<text>Shaw Direct G.P. is a direct broadcast satellite television distributor in Canada and a subsidiary of the telecommunications company Rogers Communications. As of 2010, Shaw Direct had over 900,000 subscribers. It broadcasts on Ku band from two communications satellites: Anik G1 at 107.3°W, and Anik F2 at 111.1°W. Anik F1R, which had been in service for 15 years, reached its end of life in the latter part of 2020, when the services on this satellite were migrated between the remaining two. These satellites are owned by Telesat Canada and otherwise are used primarily to distribute programming to various Canadian cable TV companies. The company was formerly known as Star Choice until April 15, 2009.

A full list of channels carried by these two satellites is available from satellite-related sites such as Lyngsat. The newer of the two satellites, Anik G1, was launched on April 15, 2013, and then later reached orbit on May 29, 2013.

Shaw Direct was founded in Lincoln, New Brunswick, but is now based in Calgary, Alberta. Its broadcast centre is in Mississauga, Ontario, and has call centres in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal.

==Technical information==

The system requires an elliptical antenna of at least 45x60cm in size with a special LNB pair built as one unit to accommodate the narrow 3.8° spacing between satellites; the receiver uses the Motorola-proprietary Digicipher II system which has so far been virtually free of the problems with pirate decryption that have plagued other providers such as rival Bell Satellite TV. The standard 18&quot; DBS antennas used by other providers are not compatible with this system as the signals differ in both frequency and polarization. Shaw Direct is relayed via FSS satellites, Anik G1 and F2.

==Services and pricing==

Shaw Direct currently features over 500 channels including all major Canadian and American networks, popular specialty services, PPV, sports packages and over 350 HD channels. Key services include:
* Multiple feeds from various affiliate stations of U.S. networks, including ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and PBS; these feeds come from Detroit (Fox excluded since 2009), Rochester (Fox only), Seattle, Spokane (PBS only since 2019), and Buffalo (PBS only since 2009).
* Crave and Super Channel (English-language premium movie services)
* Super Écran (French-language premium movie service)
* Pay Per View movies and events in standard and high definition from Shaw PPV
* NBA League Pass
* NFL Sunday Ticket
* NHL Centre Ice
* Sportsnet World (premium sports service airing soccer and rugby)
* Exxxtasy TV, Penthouse TV, Playboy TV and Red Hot TV (adult channels)
* 42 commercial-free digital music channels provided by Stingray Music
* 49 Canadian commercial radio stations

Monthly packages range from $30 for the basic service, up to $107.99 for specialty and movie channels. Individual premium and specialty channels can also be purchased. The receivers range from $99 for a basic system to $399 for a high-definition personal video recorder.

In addition, Shaw Direct provides specialty services
* 2nd Home: Allows for programming at a secondary location
* Seasonal Break: Allows you to temporarily suspend programming anywhere from 14 days and up to 180 days, with an automatic reconnect date
* Refer-A-Friend: When referring new customers to the service, you are eligible to receive up to a month of free programming

Starting in 2011, Shaw Direct offered a free satellite dish, receiver, installation and a handful of SD channels to Canadians who lost their over-the-air (OTA) access to television as a result of Canada&#x27;s digital television transition. The offer was part of Shaw&#x27;s little known Local Television Satellite Solution (LTSS) program approved by the CRTC as part of Shaw&#x27;s purchase of Canwest Global in 2010. The period to apply to the program ended August 31, 2014, three months earlier than the original extended application deadline of November 30, 2014. On April 12, 2019, the CRTC opened a public call for comments regarding Shaw Direct&#x27;s licence renewal request that included its plan to end the LTSS as of August 31, 2019. According to Shaw Direct, more than 31,500 Canadian households subscribed to the no-fee LTSS. While Shaw Direct did end up offering the LTSS beyond August 31, 2019, according to Shaw Direct customer service all remaining LTSS subscribers had been disconnected as of December 20, 2019.
