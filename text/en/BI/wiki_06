<text>John Trumbull (June 6, 1756 – November 10, 1843) was an American painter and military officer best known for his historical paintings of the American Revolutionary War, of which he was a veteran. He has been called the &quot;Painter of the Revolution&quot;. Trumbull&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; (1817), one of his four paintings that hang in the United States Capitol rotunda, is used on the reverse of the current United States two-dollar bill.

==Early life and education==
Trumbull was born in Lebanon in Connecticut Colony in 1756, to Jonathan Trumbull and Faith (née Robinson) Trumbull. His father served as governor of Connecticut from 1769 to 1784. Both sides of his family were descended from early Puritan settlers of Connecticut.

He had two older brothers, Joseph Trumbull, the first commissary general of the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War, and Jonathan Trumbull Jr., who became the second Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Trumbull entered the 1771 junior class at Harvard College at age 15 and graduated in 1773. Due to a childhood accident, Trumbull lost the use of one eye, which may have influenced his detailed painting style.

==Career==
===American Revolutionary War===
As a soldier in the American Revolutionary War, Trumbull rendered a particular service at Boston by sketching plans of the British and American lines and works. He witnessed the Battle of Bunker Hill. He was appointed second &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to General George Washington, and in June 1776, deputy adjutant general to General Horatio Gates. Trumbull resigned from the army in 1777; the cause was reported to be a dispute over the dating of his commission, which would have blocked him from further promotion.

In 1780, a financially struggling Trumbull decided to work as a professional artist and sailed to London, where he was introduced to Benjamin Franklin. Trumbull studied under Benjamin West. At West&#x27;s suggestion, Trumbull painted small pictures of the American Revolutionary War and miniature portraits. He painted about 250 such portraits in his lifetime. He also painted the portrait of Washington from memory during this time.

====Arrested in Britain====
On September 23, 1780, British agent Major John André was captured by Continental Army troops in North America; he was hanged as a spy on October 2, 1780. After news reached Great Britain, outrage flared and Trumbull was arrested for treason, since he was known to be an officer in the Continental Army and of similar rank to André.

Trumbull was imprisoned for seven months at Tothill Fields Bridewell in London.

====Return to America====
Ostracized from British society, Trumbull returned to the United States upon his release, on a voyage that lasted six months. Arriving in late January 1782, he found employment with his brother David as a commissary agent for the army stationed at New Windsor, New York, during the winter of 1782 and 1783.

===Postwar years===

In 1784, following Britain&#x27;s recognition of United States&#x27; sovereignty and independence, Trumbull returned to London to complete his apprenticeship with West. His first major work, &quot;The Deputation from the Senate Presenting to Cincinnatus the Command of the Roman Armies&quot;, was accepted and displayed by the Royal Academy of Arts in that year. In this work, Trumbull painted Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus in the likeness of George Washington. The painting&#x27;s current location is unknown. While working in his studio, Trumbull painted &quot;Battle of Bunker Hill&quot; and &quot;Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec&quot;; both works are now housed at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut.

In July 1786, Trumbull traveled to Paris, where he made portrait sketches of French officers, including &quot;Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.&quot; With assistance from Thomas Jefferson, who was then serving in Paris as the American minister to France, Trumbull began the early composition of the &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;. Over the next five years, Trumbull painted small portraits of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence, which he later used to piece together a larger painting. If a signer was deceased, Trumbull copied a previous portrait, as he did with Arthur Middleton, whose head position stands out in the painting. While visiting with each signer or their family, Trumbull was always seeking funding and used the occasion to sell subscriptions to engravings that he produced from his paintings of the American Revolution.

While in Paris, Trumbull introduced Jefferson to Italian painter Maria Cosway, and they became lifelong intimate friends. Trumbull&#x27;s painting of Jefferson, commissioned by Cosway, became widely known and was later engraved by Asher Brown Durand.

Trumbull&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; painting was purchased by the United States Congress, along with three of his other Revolutionary-era portraits, &quot;Surrender of General Burgoyne&quot;, &quot;Surrender of Lord Cornwallis&quot;, and &quot;General George Washington Resigning His Commission&quot;. Each of these portraits now hang in United States Capitol rotunda at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Congress reportedly authorized only funds sufficient to purchase these four paintings.

Trumbull completed several other paintings related to the Revolution: 
*&quot;Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker&#x27;s Hill&quot;, one version of which is now housed at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts); 
*&quot;Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec&quot; 
*&quot;Capture of the Hessians at Trenton&quot; 
*&quot;George Washington at Trenton, New Jersey, on the night of January 2, 1777&quot;. Trumbull considered this portrait &quot;the best certainly of those which I painted&quot;.
*&quot;Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton&quot;
*&quot;Washington at Verplanck&#x27;s Point&quot;, which Trumbull presented as a gift in 1790 to Martha Washington
*&quot;George Washington&quot;, commissioned by the City of New York in 1790 
*&quot;The Sortie Made by the Garrison of Gibraltar, 1789&quot;, which was once owned by the Boston Athenaeum and is now housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

==Middle years==

Trumbull&#x27;s portraits also include full lengths of General Washington (1790) and George Clinton (1791), now held in New York City Hall. New York City Hall also hangs Trumbull&#x27;s portrait of Mayor Richard Varick, who commissioned the 1790 portrait of Washington. New York also bought his full-length paintings of Alexander Hamilton (1805, the source of the face on the $10 bill) and John Jay. Trumbull was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1791 and elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1792.

He painted portraits of John Adams (1797), Jonathan Trumbull, and Rufus King (1800); Timothy Dwight and Stephen Van Rensselaer (both at Yale), Alexander Hamilton (one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and one in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, both taken from Ceracchi&#x27;s bust), a self-portrait (1833), a full-length of Washington, held at Charleston, South Carolina; a full-length of Washington in uniform, &quot;General George Washington at Trenton&quot;, (1792, at Yale); and portraits of President and Mrs. Washington (1794), in the National Museum of American History.
Trumbull himself was painted by Gilbert Stuart and many others.

In 1794, Trumbull acted as secretary to John Jay in London during the negotiation of the treaty with Great Britain, which largely settled the boundary with Canada and began cotton export to the country. In 1796, he was appointed by the commissioners sent by the two countries as the fifth member of a commission charged with carrying out the seventh article of the Jay Treaty, which mediated claims by American and British merchants and the opposing government stemming from actions that occurred during the war. Shortly after the end of Trumbull&#x27;s service on this commission, he traveled to Stuttgart to pick up the completed engraving of the &quot;Battle of Bunker&#x27;s Hill&quot;. On the return trip, he passed through Paris and carried the first dispatch from the XYZ Affair out of France.

Trumbull later encountered hard times during which he was failing to sell his paintings individually. In 1831, he sold a series of 28 paintings and 60 miniature portraits to Yale University for an annuity of $1,000. After many years of trying to create income from his paintings, he had finally found a way to sustain himself from his art. This is by far the largest single collection of his works. The collection was originally housed in a neoclassical art gallery designed by Trumbull on Yale&#x27;s Old Campus, along with portraits by other artists.

==Later years==

Trumbull was appointed president of the American Academy of the Fine Arts in New York City, serving from 1816 to 1836. Emphasizing classical traditions, Trumbull did not get along with the students. At the same time, his painting skills declined. In 1825, many of the students withdrew, founding the National Academy of Design. Unable to accommodate to changing tastes, the American Academy later closed in 1839 after a second fire destroyed its collections.

Trumbull wrote his autobiography, which he published in 1841. He died in New York City at the age of 87 on November 10, 1843.

==Legacy and honors==

*Trumbull was originally interred (along with his wife) beneath the Art Gallery at Yale University, which he had designed. In 1867, the collection of his works was moved to the newly built Street Hall. His wife and his remains were reinterred on those grounds. The Trumbull Gallery was later razed.
*1965, the John Trumbull Birthplace in Lebanon, Connecticut, was declared a National Historic Landmark.
*1968, a John Trumbull commemorative postage stamp was printed.

<text>The Chartered Management Institute (CMI) is a professional institution for management based in the United Kingdom. It was founded as the British Institute of Management (BIM) in 1947 or 1948, merged with the Institution of Industrial Managers (IIM) in 1992 to form the Institute of Management (IM), and gained a royal charter, and its present name, in 2002.

The major membership classes are:
*&quot;Member&quot;
*&quot;Fellow&quot; – for those with significant expertise, and 
*&quot;Companion&quot; – the most senior grade.

In addition to supporting its members, the organisation encourages management development, carries out research, produces a wide variety of publications on management interests, and publishes the official members&#x27; magazine, &quot;Professional Manager&quot;. The institute also engages with government and other public bodies concerning policy on management and business related issues. &quot;Professional Manager&quot; magazine is circulated to over 80,000 members of the CMI.

== Chartered Manager (CMgr) ==

The Chartered Manager process requires candidates to demonstrate how they have developed as a manager and how they have applied their leadership and management skills to achieve significant business impact. Following an application, successful candidate are entitled to use the designatory post-nominal letters of CMgr.

There are two routes to becoming Chartered:
* Assessment Route - Available to those who have completed a degree level qualification in management with at least three years managerial experience or for those without degree qualification to have a minimum of five years relevant experience.
* Fast Track Route - Available to those who hold at least a CMI Level 5 Diploma with at least three years of relevant managerial experience.

Candidate who have less than 3 years managerial experience might be given the Foundation Chartered status, which requires a management qualification at a degree/non-degree level equivalent to at least CMI Level 3,4 or 5 and/or CMI Level 6 and 7. This grade carries entitlement to use the designatory post-nominal letters of fCMgr.

Criteria and requirements for chartered status in the UK have to be approved by the Privy Council; as such the criteria for Chartered Manager designation are &quot;broadly similar&quot; to chartered statuses in other fields.

== History ==
Timeline

*1945 - Sir Stafford Cripps, the president of the Board of Trade appointed a Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Clive Baillieu (president of the Federation of British Industries - the forerunner of the CBS) to formulate detailed proposals for the establishment of a central institution for all aspects related to management. One of the reasons behind this move was the realisation that, although there were professional bodies representing functional activities, there was no comparable body for general management thinking and for the development and promotion of better management.
*1947 or 1948 - Following the recommendations of the &quot;Baillieu Report&quot;, the British Institute of Management (BIM) was formed (sources differ as to the exact year).

*1987 - The BIM, in conjunction with other bodies, issued two pivotal reports, The making of British managers (John Constable and Roger McCormick), and The making of managers (Charles Handy). These reports led to the formation of the National Forum for Management Education and Development (NFMED) and, subsequently, the Management Charter Initiative (MCI), which spearheaded the issue of the world&#x27;s first competency-based national management standards.
*1992 - BIM merged with the Institution of Industrial Managers (IIM) to form the Institute of Management (IM). The awarding body status of the IIM was transferred to the new Institute.

<text>Professional institutions are the societies and associations, they help develop and promote a career and the people who practice in it. There are many chartered professional institutes in the UK, over 80, that cover many different areas of work. The different areas of work that are covered includes constructions, health, journalism, personnel, finance, engineering, law and of course, management. The professional institutes can help you both before and after you graduate.

==Introduction==
There are institutes that have websites that you&#x27;re able to sign up to, where they help you with your development and challenges within the professional institutes. One of the websites that provides this service is Management &amp; Leadership Development and Training the Chartered Management Institute. You are able to attend events and take courses based on many different types of institutes in management and learn about development, these would include: Leadership event, Building a business event, Visionary leaders event, Introduction to Management course and Essential management skills course. They say that they are the only Awarding Body that are able to award Chartered Manager status, which is the ultimate management accolade.
Different institutes have different ways of helping you further in your career, such as learning styles. The institutes would assess you, and how they assess you would be individual to the institute; it would most likely be based on your education, knowledge, skills and experience. They might also have different ways of grading and awarding points, as well as different types of membership that you&#x27;re able to have; some institutes have one day programs, monthly programs and even group programs.

==Management==
Management is a major factor in all careers, it consists of organising, controlling, planning and also, directing. Management is at the top of hierarchy as it is what controls everything else within a company/business. If there is no management, then there would be no order or organisation within a company, this would result in the company not being successful. This is why institutes for management would be important and very useful.

There are many different areas of work that go into management; it expands into many different sectors due to how broad management is. Some of the different types of management includes, Accounting management, Business management and Marketing management.

==Institutes==
An institute is an organisation that has a particular purpose, in this case, the purpose is for further and higher education; some higher education institutions hold university statues&#x27;.

The higher education institutions need to have a distinct image that they should maintain and also to develop, this would be so that they can create a competitive advantage as the market is increasingly competitive. There is a tertiary education system that is undergoing fundamental metamorphosis, this is both in the UK and South Africa; they are both facing changes in government funding. There are at least 71 different institutes that are represented in the UK and at least 20 different institutions from South Africa.

There is also a company website called &#x27;IMD World Competitiveness Centre&#x27;, they have a partnership with institutes and have a worldwide network. They have partner institutes in 55 countries; the IMD World Competitiveness Centre helps with business, academics highlight competitive advantage, governments and undercover opportunities by offering a range of products and services which includes workshops and economy assessments. They have partner institutes in Africa/Middle East and they include in Israel, Jordan, Qatar, South Africa and United Arab Emirates. Partner Institutes in America includes, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. In Asia/Pacific they include Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. Lastly, in Europe they include, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine.

Although there are institutes that are profitable, there are also institutes that are not profitable. In the UK, there is an institute called &#x27;Project Management Institute&#x27; and it is the world&#x27;s leading non profitable professional membership association. It was founded in 1969 and it delivers value for more than 2.9 million professionals that work in nearly every country, they advance careers and improve organisational success.

==UK==
The UK government policies dictate that education in higher education institutes look to profit-making organisations for models that would help with performance improvement (Galloway, 1998). This would mean that there is a need for strengthening of the partnership between educational institutes and business.

<text>The UK Classical Charts are three record charts based on classical music in the United Kingdom: the Classical Artist Albums Chart, the Classical Compilation Albums Chart and the Specialist Classical Albums Chart. The charts are commercial monitoring and marketing devices used by the UK music industry to measure its effectiveness in promoting and selling albums, nominally in the field of classical music. All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC). The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established. Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists. For an album to be classified as classical in the charts, it has to have 60% of the playing time dedicated to &quot;classical or traditional music&quot;. Only albums that entirely classical or traditional music qualify for inclusion in the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.

<text>Windorah is a town and a locality in the Shire of Barcoo, Queensland, Australia. It is one of only three towns in the Shire of Barcoo in Central West Queensland. In the , the locality of Windorah had a population of 104 people.

== Geography ==
Located downstream from where the Thomson and Barcoo Rivers join to form the multi-channelled Cooper Creek, the Shire covers an area of . The town has a population of 60 people, with a further 40 living at surrounding stations.

A landscape of rocky outcrops, multiple sand hills and black soil flood plains make up most of the area surrounding the town. Water in the town follows the outback cycle of boom and bust. During a wet year Cooper Creek may flood more than a half a dozen times, during the dry it becomes a chain of waterholes. Downstream of the town stretches the Cooper Floodplain below Windorah Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for waterbirds when flooded.

== History ==
Before the onset of British colonisation, the area around Windorah was inhabited by the Kulumali people, who spoke the Birria (Pirriya) language. The men of this group were circumcised, cut cicatrices on their chest and had one or two of their upper central incisors removed as part of their initiation rites. They also chewed pituri as a stimulant. The population upon first contact with the British was estimated to be under 1,000 people.

The British first entered the region in August 1847 with the arrival of the expedition led by Edmund Kennedy. He encountered hundreds of Kulumali people living in the region and had several tense interactions with them over the ability to pass through their land and have access to their waterholes. Near the present town of Windorah, the situation was further inflamed with the Aboriginal people tampering with the expedition&#x27;s cache of flour and by Kennedy twice attempting to force a negotiation in which he would take an Aboriginal child. A nulla nulla was thrown, and on two occasions Kennedy&#x27;s men charged their horses at a group of resident Kulumali, whipping them and firing pistols above their heads to disperse them.

George Fitzwalter established a shop and a hotel in 1878 on a stock route which became the town of Stoney Point. The name was changed to Windorah in 1884. Cobb &amp; Co once ran a stage coach service between Windorah and Adavale. It is stated that the town is named after the local Aboriginal word for &quot;Big Fish&quot;, although according to an account of the Durack settlers, the name means &quot;high, stony place.&quot;

On 5 January 1884, police constable Nathaniel Roberts stationed at Windorah died from thirst while lost in the bush near Connemarra Station.

Windorah Provisional School opened on 30 July 1888. In 1897 it became a half-time school, sharing a teacher with Cooper&#x27;s Creek Provisional School, but reverted to a full-time school in 1903. In 1907, it became a half-time school with Cooper&#x27;s Creek school again, and then closed in 1915. However, it reopened in 1916, only to close again in 1918. In 1926, it reopened and remains operating as Windorah State School. It celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2013.

On 30 November 1888, police constable Thomas Joseph Callaghan died while on patrol near Whitula pastoral station when he became lost in the bush without water and died of thirst. The temperature at the time was up to in the shade. He was buried in an unmarked grave west of the town of Windorah.

The town was completely isolated by floodwater in 1949 after surrounding areas were inundated by heavy rainfall. Low cloud and more rain prevented relief food supplies from being delivered by air from a RAAF Dakota.

In 2009, Ergon Energy established its first solar farm in Windorah. The Windorah Solar Farm provides electricity to the town of Windorah and surrounding rural areas.

<doc id="340276" wikidata="Q1574222" url="?curid=340276" title="The Waterboy">
<text>The Waterboy is a 1998 American sports comedy film directed by Frank Coraci. It was written by Adam Sandler as well as Tim Herlihy and produced by Robert Simonds and Jack Giarraputo. Sandler also stars as the title character while Kathy Bates, Fairuza Balk, Henry Winkler, Jerry Reed, Lawrence Gilliard Jr., Blake Clark, Peter Dante, and Jonathan Loughran play other characters.

Lynn Swann, Lawrence Taylor, Jimmy Johnson, Bill Cowher, Paul &quot;The Big Show&quot; Wight, and Rob Schneider have cameo appearances. The film was extremely profitable, earning $39.4 million in its opening weekend alone in the United States, earning a total of $190 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics.

== Plot ==
Bobby Boucher is a socially inept, stuttering 31-year-old man serving as the water boy for the University of Louisiana football program. He lives with his protective and extremely religious mother, Helen, and believes his father, Robert Sr., died of dehydration in the Sahara while serving in the Peace Corps back in the 1960s. As the players constantly bully Bobby, the Cougars&#x27; head coach, Red Beaulieu, fires him for being &quot;disruptive&quot; during the 18 years of his employment. Bobby approaches Coach Klein of the South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs and is retained as the water boy on a voluntary basis.

The Mud Dogs have lost 40 consecutive games, their cheerleaders as well as the mascot are alcoholics, and players are forced to share equipment due to budget cuts. When the new team teases him, Klein encourages Bobby to stand up for himself. Remembering all the bullying he has put up with over the years, Bobby tackles the team&#x27;s quarterback, knocking him out. Seeing Bobby&#x27;s potential, Klein meets with Helen and tries to persuade her to let Bobby play on the team, but she refuses, saying it is too dangerous.

Klein convinces Bobby to play anyway, seeing that he is eager to attend college. Bobby becomes a feared outside linebacker, in his first game, he costs the Mud Dogs a win in order to take down a player that trash-talked his mother. Afterwards, the Mud Dogs go on a winning streak. Bobby&#x27;s newfound fame and confidence also allow him to reconnect with his felonious childhood love interest, Vicki Vallencourt. Helen forbids Bobby from seeing her, insisting that she &quot;is the devil&quot;.

The team&#x27;s success earns them new uniforms and a trip to the annual Bourbon Bowl on New Year&#x27;s Day to face the Cougars and Coach Beaulieu. However, Beaulieu and his team crash the Mud Dogs&#x27; pep rally and reveal that the high school Bobby went to does not exist and that he was homeschooled, and his fake high school transcript makes him ineligible for college and football. The team and fans turn against Bobby, believing him to be a liar and cheater.

Klein convinces the NCAA to let Bobby play if he can pass a GED exam. He apologizes to Bobby and admits to submitting the fake transcript because he was desperate to finally win something and get even with Beaulieu. Twenty years ago, Klein and Beaulieu were assistant coaches at the University of Louisiana and the predecessor was retiring. After Beaulieu intimidated Klein into turning over his playbook and took credit for the plays, he was promoted, and Klein was fired. Klein suffered a mental breakdown and became unable to come up with new plays. The story convinces Bobby to help Klein get revenge on Beaulieu and prove himself to everyone. Bobby finally stands up to Helen while studying for the GED, angrily revealing that he has been playing football, going to college, and seeing Vicki, and intends to continue doing so.

Bobby passes the exam with flying colors, but Helen feigns a coma. Feeling he drove his mother to illness, Bobby stays in the hospital with her. Meanwhile, Vicki leads a gathering of fans to the hospital to convince him to play. Seeing her son struggling to ignore this, Helen ends her fake illness. She tells Bobby the truth about Robert Sr., who abandoned her while she was four months pregnant with Bobby to have an affair with a voodoo priestess named Phyllis in New Orleans while living up life in the city. This led to Helen constantly fearing that Bobby would leave her too. Deciding to put her son&#x27;s happiness ahead of her own selfishness, she encourages him to play in the Bourbon Bowl.

Arriving at halftime via airboat, Bobby finds the Mud Dogs losing by a score of 27–0. As Bobby dominates the field and enables an interception-turned-touchdown, Red has his offense take a knee, knowing Bobby can not cause a turnover and the fact that the SCLSU offense is useless. Using the same technique of &quot;visualizing and attacking&quot; that Klein taught him, Bobby then turns the lesson back on him. Klein overcomes his fear of Beaulieu and comes up with amazing new plays. The Mud Dogs begin catching up. Bobby is then given a cheap shot by Meaney, Red&#x27;s toughest defender and is knocked out cold. Vicki is able to revive Bobby by giving him the Alaskan water Bobby was in possession of. Bobby and the Mud Dogs carry out one final play before the clock strikes zero and win the Bourbon Bowl 30–27, and Bobby is named the game&#x27;s MVP.

Sometime later, Bobby and Vicki get married. Robert Sr., who has since adopted the nickname &quot;Roberto&quot;, makes a surprise appearance to try to convince Bobby to skip school and go to the NFL so he can share in his son&#x27;s newfound fame. Helen angrily tackles him to the ground for talking to Bobby like that and for abandoning her and Bobby years ago, prompting cheers from the attendants. Bobby and Vicki leave on his lawn mower to consummate their marriage.

==Cast==
==Production==
The idea for &quot;The Waterboy&quot; came from one of Adam Sandler&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; characters. Sandler said &quot;You could compare him to &#x27;Canteen Boy,&#x27; whereas he does love water and they both get picked on a lot, but the thing I like the most about this character is just that he is a genuine, good person.&quot;

Writer Tim Herlihy said the story was intended to invert the formula of his previous films, where Sandler was an extreme character surrounded by regular people. &quot;With Happy Gilmore, [...] it was a very straight world that he was the disruptive element in. The pressure was all on Adam to be funny as Happy. Whereas this was like a funhouse, crazy version of Southern college football milieu. And it was the first movie where things were funny when Adam wasn&#x27;t on screen. The pressure wasn&#x27;t even on him.&quot;
Herlihy could not believe their luck getting Kathy Bates to play Boucher&#x27;s mother. Bates&#x27; agent did not want her to do the film, and Bates threw the script in the trash after reading some pages, not being interested in football. Her niece spotted the script and noticed Sandler&#x27;s name, and convinced her to reconsider.

===Filming===

Despite taking place in Louisiana, &quot;The Waterboy&quot; was mostly filmed in Central Florida and the Orlando area, as well as Clermont, Daytona Beach, DeLand, and Lakeland.

The Mud Dogs home games were filmed at Spec Martin Stadium in DeLand, home of the local high school&#x27;s football team, as well as the Stetson Hatters (Pioneer League, FCS) The classrooms and gym where Bobby takes the GED are part of Stetson University, also located in DeLand. Stetson&#x27;s Carlton Student Union building is featured in the scene where Bobby is told his mother has been hospitalized.

The scenes involving mama&#x27;s cabin were shot on Lake Louisa in Clermont.

Coach Klein&#x27;s office was a stage built inside of the Florida Army National Guard Armory in DeLand. It is home of Btry B 1st Bn 265th ADA. In the background of the practice field scenes, the Armory and some military vehicles can be seen.

The initial exterior shot of the University of Louisiana stadium was TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville; the interior of the stadium is actually the Camping World Stadium in Orlando. The Camping World Stadium was also the filming location for the climactic Bourbon Bowl game, while the flyover shot at the beginning of the game is of Williams-Brice Stadium at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, South Carolina.

The &quot;medulla oblongata&quot; lecture scene was filmed at Florida Southern College in Lakeland. The extras in the scene were students at the college, and the scene was shot on campus in Edge Hall.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack for &quot;The Waterboy&quot; was released on November 3, 1998 by Hollywood Records.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
As of July 2022, review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported the film had an approval rating of 34% based on 76 reviews with an average rating of 4.50/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;This is an insult to its genre with low humor and cheap gags.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 41% based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, saying &quot;Sandler is making a tactical error when he creates a character whose manner and voice has the effect of fingernails on a blackboard, and then expects us to hang in there for a whole movie.&quot; He also included the film on his most hated list. Lisa Alspector of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; also gave the film a negative review, writing &quot;Geek triumphs after all comedies can be charming, but in this one the triumphing begins so early it&#x27;s hard to feel for the geek.&quot;

Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the movie as &quot;[a]nother film about . . . a cretinous, grating loser.&quot; Manohla Dargis of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; gave the film a mixed review, writing: &quot;Of course it&#x27;s dumb, but every 10 minutes or so, it&#x27;s also pretty funny.&quot; Glen Lovell of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of the film, &quot;This yahoos on the bayou farce is neither inventive nor outrageous enough.&quot; David Nusair of &quot;Reel Film Reviews&quot; also gave the film a mixed review, calling it &quot;an agreeable yet forgettable comedy.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the film was &quot;so cheerfully outlandish that it&#x27;s hard to resist, and so good hearted that it&#x27;s genuinely endearing.&quot; Mark Savlov of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; also gave the film a positive review, writing that it was &quot;A mildly amusing bayou farce with plenty of &#x27;foosball&#x27; action to liven the sometimes plodding proceedings.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;The Waterboy&quot; grossed $169,429,646 in the United States, and a further $28,700,000 internationally, for a worldwide total of $190,191,646 worldwide, against an estimated production budget of $20 million. The film opened at number 1 at the US box office, earning $39,414,071 in its opening weekend, a record opening for November, surpassing &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot;. The trailer for &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; was released alongside the film, in its second week.

The film was released in the United Kingdom on April 30, 1999, and topped the country&#x27;s box office that weekend. As of 2020, &quot;The Waterboy&quot; is the highest-grossing film in the sports comedy genre.

===Accolades===

For his role, Sandler was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor. The Stinkers Bad Movie Awards awarded him Most Annoying Fake Accent in 1998. He also won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award and a MTV Movie Award for his performance. In 2000, the American Film Institute, nominated the film for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Laughs.

===Legacy===
Comparisons are often made between former LSU head coach Ed Orgeron and &quot;Waterboy&quot; character Farmer Fran due to Orgeron&#x27;s Louisiana roots, Cajun heritage and accent.

==Future==
In September 2022, Sandler stated that he was open to making a sequel. While the actor stated that he has not figured out the story yet, he was looking forward to returning in the title role at some point.

<doc id="340280" wikidata="Q75786" url="?curid=340280" title="Eduard Bernstein">
<text>Eduard Bernstein (; 6 January 1850 – 18 December 1932) was a German Marxist theorist and politician. A prominent member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), he has been both condemned and praised as a &quot;revisionist&quot; who challenged major aspects of Karl Marx&#x27;s thought. A key influence on the European social democratic movement, Bernstein argued for reformism over revolutionary action, and for a gradual democratization of capitalist society to achieve socialism.

Bernstein joined the Social Democratic Workers Party in 1872, which was merged into the SPD in 1875. He lived in exile in Switzerland and later London from 1878 to 1901, and in 1880 met Marx and Engels, who impressed him with their thought. With Karl Kautsky, Bernstein was one of the drafters of the party&#x27;s Erfurt Program of 1891. In his 1899 book &quot;The Prerequisites of Socialism&quot;, Bernstein argued that socialism would be achieved through accumulated reforms and improvements of capitalism, rejecting the dialectical and revolutionary elements of Marxism. He was a member of the Imperial Reichstag from 1901 to 1907, and again from 1912 to 1918. After World War I, during which he joined the anti-war Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), he was again a member of the Reichstag from 1920 to 1928.

== Early life ==

Bernstein was born in Berlin-Kreuzberg to Jewish parents who were active in the Reform Temple on the Johannistrasse whose services were performed on Sunday. His father was a locomotive driver. From 1866 to 1878, he was employed in banks as a banker&#x27;s clerk after leaving school.

Bernstein&#x27;s political career began in 1872, when he joined a socialist party with Marxist tendencies, known formally as the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Germany. The party was a proponent of the Eisenacher style of German socialism, named after the German town where it was founded. Bernstein soon became known as an activist. His party contested two elections against a rival socialist party, the Lassalleans (Ferdinand Lassalle&#x27;s General German Workers&#x27; Association), but in both elections neither party was able to win a significant majority of the left-wing vote. Consequently, Bernstein, together with August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, prepared the &quot;Einigungsparteitag&quot; (&quot;Unification Party Congress&quot;) with the Lassalleans in Gotha in 1875. Karl Marx&#x27;s famous &quot;Critique of the Gotha Program&quot; criticized what he saw as a Lassallean victory over the Eisenachers, whom he favoured. Bernstein later noted that it was Liebknecht, considered by many to be the strongest Marxist advocate within the Eisenacher faction, who proposed the inclusion of many of the ideas that so thoroughly irritated Marx.

In the 1877 elections, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) gained 493,000 votes. However, two assassination attempts on Kaiser Wilhelm I the next year provided Chancellor Otto von Bismarck a pretext to introduce a law banning all socialist organizations, assemblies and publications. There had been no Social Democratic involvement in either assassination attempt, but the popular reaction against &quot;enemies of the Reich&quot; induced a compliant Reichstag to approve Bismarck&#x27;s Anti-Socialist Laws.

Bismarck&#x27;s strict anti-socialist legislation was passed on 12 October 1878. For nearly all practical purposes the SPD was outlawed, and it was actively suppressed throughout Germany. However, it was still possible for Social Democrats to campaign as individuals for election to the Reichstag, which they did in spite of severe persecution. The party actually increased its electoral success, gaining 550,000 votes in 1884 and 763,000 in 1887.

==Exile==

The vehemence of Bernstein&#x27;s opposition to the government of Bismarck made it desirable for him to leave Germany. Shortly before the Anti-Socialist Laws came into effect, Bernstein went into exile in Zurich, accepting a position as the private secretary of Karl Höchberg, a wealthy supporter of social democracy. A warrant subsequently issued for his arrest ruled out any possibility for him to return to Germany, and he was to remain in exile for more than 20 years. In 1888, Bismarck convinced the Swiss government to expel a number of important members of German social democracy and so Bernstein relocated to London, where he associated with Friedrich Engels and Karl Kautsky. It was soon after his arrival in Switzerland that he began to think of himself as a Marxist. In 1880, he accompanied Bebel to London to clear up a misunderstanding concerning his involvement with an article published by Höchberg that was denounced by Marx and Engels as being &quot;chock-full of bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideas&quot;. The visit was a success, and Engels in particular was impressed by Bernstein&#x27;s zeal and ideas.


Back in Zurich, Bernstein became increasingly active in working for &quot;Der Sozialdemokrat&quot; (&quot;Social Democrat&quot;) and later succeeded Georg von Vollmar as the paper&#x27;s editor, which he was for 10 years. It was during those years between 1880 and 1890 that Bernstein established his reputation as a major party theoretician and a Marxist of impeccable orthodoxy. He was helped in that by the close personal and professional relationship he established with Engels. The relationship owed much to the fact that he shared Engels&#x27;s strategic vision and accepted most of the particular policies that Engels believed the ideas to entail. In 1887, the German government persuaded the Swiss authorities to ban &quot;Der Sozialdemokrat&quot;. Bernstein moved to London, where he resumed publication from premises in Kentish Town. His relationship with Engels soon developed into friendship. He also communicated with various English socialist organizations, notably the Fabian Society and Henry Mayers Hyndman&#x27;s Social Democratic Federation. In later years, his opponents routinely claimed that his &quot;revisionism&quot; was caused by seeing the world &quot;through English spectacles&quot;. However, Bernstein denied the charges.

In 1895, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of &quot;The Class Struggles in France&quot;, written by Marx in 1850, had been edited by Bernstein and Kautsky in a manner that left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism. On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky: I was amazed to see today in the &quot;Vorwärts&quot; an excerpt from my &#x27;Introduction&#x27; that had been &quot;printed without my knowledge&quot; and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality &quot;quand même&quot; (at all costs). Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its entirety in the &quot;Neue Zeit&quot; in order that this disgraceful impression may be erased. I shall leave Liebknecht in no doubt as to what I think about it and the same applies to those who, irrespective of who they may be, gave him this opportunity of perverting my views and, what&#x27;s more, without so much as a word to me about it.

In 1891, Bernstein was one of the authors of the Erfurt Program and from 1896 to 1898, he published a series of articles entitled &quot;Probleme des Sozialismus&quot; (&quot;Problems of Socialism&quot;) that resulted in the revisionism debate in the SPD. He also published the book &quot;Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie&quot; (&quot;The Prerequisites for Socialism and the Tasks of Social Democracy&quot;) in 1899. The book was in great contrast to the positions of Bebel, Kautsky and Liebknecht. Rosa Luxemburg&#x27;s 1900 essay &quot;Reform or Revolution?&quot; was also a polemic against Bernstein&#x27;s position. In 1900, Bernstein published &quot;Zur Geschichte und Theorie des Sozialismus&quot; (&quot;The History and Theory of Socialism&quot;).

==Return to Germany==

In 1901, Bernstein returned to Germany after the end of the ban that had kept him from entering the country. He became an editor of the newspaper &quot;Vorwärts&quot; that year and a member of the Reichstag from 1902 to 1918. He voted against the armament tabling in 1913, together with the SPD fraction&#x27;s left wing. Although he voted for war credits in August 1914, he opposed World War I from July 1915 and, in 1917, was among the founders of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), which united antiwar socialists, including reformists like Bernstein, centrists like Kautsky and revolutionary socialists like Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. 

He was a member of the USPD until 1919, when he rejoined the SPD. From 1920 to 1928, Bernstein was again a member of the Reichstag. On 4 March 1920, as an expert on Anglo-German relations under the German Empire, he became a member of the parliamentary committee investigating the war guilt question. He was one of only a few deputies on the committee to admit Germany&#x27;s responsibility for the outbreak of war, setting himself apart from the majority of Reichstag members in the bourgeois parties. He retired from political life in 1928.

==Death and legacy==
Bernstein died on 18 December 1932 in Berlin. A commemorative plaque is placed in his memory at Bozener Straße 18, Berlin-Schöneberg, where he lived from 1918 until his death. His grave in the Eisackstrasse Cemetery became a &quot;grave of honour&quot; () in Berlin.

== Main Contributions ==
=== Opposition to violent revolution ===
&quot;Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus&quot; (1899) was Bernstein&#x27;s most significant work. Bernstein was principally concerned with refuting Karl Marx&#x27;s predictions about the imminent and inevitable demise of capitalism and Marx&#x27;s consequent laissez-faire policy which opposed ameliorative social interventions before the demise. Bernstein indicated simple facts, which he considered to be evidence that Marx&#x27;s predictions were not being borne out while he noted that while the centralization of capitalist industry was significant, it was not becoming wholescale and that the ownership of capital was becoming more and not less diffuse. Bernstein&#x27;s analysis of agriculture, according to which Bernstein believed that land ownership was becoming less concentrated, was largely based on the work of Eduard David and was in its marshalling of facts impressive enough that even his Orthodox Marxist opponent Karl Kautsky acknowledged its value.

As to Marx&#x27;s belief in the disappearance of the middleman, Bernstein declared that the entrepreneur class was being steadily recruited from the proletariat class and so all compromise measures, such as the state regulation of the hours of labour and provisions for old-age pensions should be encouraged. For that reason, Bernstein urged the labouring classes to take an active interest in politics. Bernstein also indicated what he considered to be some of the flaws in Marx&#x27;s labour theory of value.

Looking especially at the rapid growth in Germany, Bernstein argued that middle-sized firms would flourish, the size and power of the middle class would grow and that capitalism would successfully adjust and not collapse. He warned that a violent proletarian revolution, as in France in 1848, produced only reactionary successes, which undermined workers&#x27; interests. Therefore, he rejected revolution and instead insisted the best strategy to be patiently building up a durable social movement working for continuous nonviolent incremental change.

In his work, &quot;The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism: Eduard Bernstein and Social Democracy&quot;, Manfred Steger touches on Bernstein&#x27;s desire for socialism through peaceful means and incremental legislation. Some say that is Marxism in its mature form after the revisionists claimed many of Marx&#x27;s theories to be wrong and came up with theories of their own, including socialism coming through democratic means.

===Bernstein&#x27;s views under attack===
Bernstein was vilified by the orthodox Marxists led by Karl Kautsky as well as the more radical current led by Rosa Luxemburg for his revisionism. Nonetheless, Bernstein remained very much a socialist, albeit an unorthodox one as he believed that socialism would be achieved by the advancement of capitalism to social democracy and so on, not by capitalism&#x27;s destruction (as rights were gradually won by workers, their cause for grievance would be diminished and consequently, so too would the motivation for revolution). During the intra-party debates about his ideas, Bernstein explained that for him the final goal of socialism was nothing; progress toward that goal was everything.

Luxemburg argued that socialism has its end in social revolution and revisionism &quot;amounts in practice to the advice [...] that we abandon the social revolution—the goal of Social Democracy—and turn social reform from a means of the class struggle into its final aim&quot;. She says revisionism has lost sight of scientific socialism and reverted to idealism and therefore lost its predictive force. Since reformists underestimate the anarchy of capitalism and say it has adaptability and viability, by which they mean that the contradictions of capitalism would not of historical necessity drive it to its doom, Luxemburg said they would abandon the objective necessity for socialism and give up all hope for a socialist future. The movement would collapse unless revisionism is repudiated. Trade unionists, who could see the successes of capitalism and the improvement of working conditions and who wanted to improve working conditions through parliament, generally followed Bernstein while those who were more orthodox generally followed Luxemburg.

=== Foreign policy ===
Foreign policy was Bernstein&#x27;s main intellectual interest between 1902 and 1914, with many articles in the &quot;Sozialistische Monatshefte&quot; (&quot;Socialist Monthly&quot;). He advocated policy positions for Germany that were aggressively nationalist, imperialist and expansionist.

Bernstein considered protectionism (high tariffs on imports) as helping only a selective few, being &quot;fortschrittsfeindlich&quot; (anti-progressive) for its negative effects on the masses. He argued Germany&#x27;s protectionism was based only on political expediency, isolating Germany from the world (especially from Britain), creating an autarky that would result only in conflict between Germany and the rest of the world. Bernstein wanted to end Germany&#x27;s protectionism and argued that tariffs did not increase grain production, did not counter British competition, did not increase farm profits and did not promote improvements in farming. Instead, it inflated rents, interest rates and prices, hurting everyone involved. In contrast, he argued that free trade led to peace, democracy, prosperity and the highest material and moral well-being of all humanity.

Bernstein rejected reactionary bourgeois nationalism and called instead for a cosmopolitan-libertarian nationalism. He recognized the historical role of the national factor and said that the proletariat must support their country against external dangers. He called on workers to assimilate themselves within nation-states, which entailed support for colonial policies and imperial projects. Bernstein was sympathetic to the idea of imperial expansions as a positive and civilizing mission, which resulted in a bitter series of polemics with the anti-imperialist Ernest Belfort Bax. Bernstein supported colonialism as he believed it uplifted backward peoples and it worked well for both Britain and Germany. Bernstein supported such policies in an intensely racialized manner, arguing in 1896 that &quot;races who are hostile to or incapable of civilisation cannot claim our sympathy when they revolt against civilisation&quot; and that the &quot;savages [must] be subjugated and made to conform to the rules of higher civilisation&quot;. However, he was disturbed by the Kaiser&#x27;s reckless policies. He wanted strong friendship especially with Britain and France and protection against the Russian threat to Germany. He envisioned a sort of league of nations.

=== Zionism ===
Bernstein&#x27;s views on Jewish matters evolved. He never identified as a Zionist, but after initially favouring a wholly assimilationist solution to &quot;the Jewish Question&quot;, his attitude toward Zionism became considerably more sympathetic after World War I.

===Homosexuality===
Bernstein is also noted for being &quot;one of the first socialists to deal sympathetically with the issue of homosexuality&quot;.

<text>Elephantine ( ; ; ; &quot;Elephantíne&quot;; , ) is an island on the Nile, forming part of the city of Aswan in Upper Egypt. The archaeological digs on the island became a World Heritage Site in 1979, along with other examples of Upper Egyptian architecture, as part of the &quot;Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae&quot; (despite Elephantine being neither Nubian, nor between Abu Simbel and Philae).

The island has been studied through excavation sites. Aramaic papyri and ostraca have been collected to study what life was like on Elephantine during the time of ancient Egypt. There have been studies about the Elephantine Triad and the Jewish presence that formulated on the island. The standard reference collection of the Aramaic documents of the Elephantine Papyri and Ostraca is the &quot;Textbook of Aramaic Documents from Ancient Egypt&quot;.

==Geography==
Elephantine, or what ancient Egyptians called Yebu or Abu is located at the uppermost part of the Nile river that is a part of Aswan. Elephantine had the first nome of the northern part of Egypt. Elephantine is 1,600 metres from north to south and 450 metres across at its widest point. The layout of this and other nearby islands in Aswan can be seen from west bank hillsides along the Nile. The island is located just downstream of the First Cataract, at the southern border of Upper Egypt with Lower Nubia. This region above is called Upper Egypt because it is further up the Nile.

The island may have received its name after its shape, which in aerial views is similar to that of an elephant tusk, or from the rounded rocks along the banks resembling elephants.

==Ancient Egypt==
Known to the ancient Egyptians as &quot;Elephant&quot; (Middle Egyptian: → Medio-Late Egyptian: → Coptic: (Ⲉ)ⲓⲏⲃ , preserved in its Hebrew name, &quot;Yēḇ&quot;), the island of Elephantine stood at the border between Egypt and Nubia. Trade routes would stop on Elephantine to deliver ivory, a precious good in ancient Egypt. It was an excellent defensive site for a fort, making it a natural cargo transfer point for river trade. During the Second Intermediate Period (1650–1550 BC), the fort marked the southern border of Egypt. The island was also a vital stone quarry, providing granite for monuments and buildings all over Egypt.

Historical texts from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt mention the mother of Amenemhat I, founder of the Twelfth Dynasty, being from the Elephantine Egyptian nome Ta-Seti. Many scholars have argued that Amenemhat I&#x27;s mother was of Nubian origin.

===Archaeological sites===
Between 1893 and 1910, Aramaic papyri, consisting of Jewish achievements, were found and collected on Elephantine. There has been a large presence of German excavations, with a vast number of discoveries of papyri and ostraca. The documents have led to discoveries about Jewish presence and significance in Elephantine. French teams also set out to Elephantine where they discovered several hundred ostraca, but very few have been published thus far. The major findings from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century are found in these museums: Berlin, Brooklyn, Cairo, London, Munich, and Paris.

Ongoing excavations by the German Archaeological Institute at the town have uncovered many findings on display in the Aswan Museum located on the island, including a mummified ram of Khnum. Artifacts dating back to prehistoric Egypt have been found on Elephantine. A rare calendar, known as the &quot;Elephantine Calendar of Things&quot;, which dates to the reign of Thutmose III during the Eighteenth Dynasty, was found in fragments on the island.

====Temples====
Before 1822, there were temples to Thutmose III and Amenhotep III on the island. In 1822, they were destroyed during the campaign of Muhammad Ali, who had taken power in Egypt, to conquer Sudan.

The main two temples of the island were for Satet and Khnum. The first temple was the temple of Satet, founded around 3000 BC and enlarged and renovated over the next 3,000 years. There are records of an Egyptian temple to Khnum on the island as early as the Third Dynasty. This temple was completely rebuilt in the Late Period, during the Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt, just before the foreign rule that followed in the Graeco-Roman Period. The Greeks formed the Ptolemaic dynasty during their 300-year rule over Egypt (305–30 BC) and maintained the ancient religious customs and traditions while often associating the Egyptian deities with their own.

Most of the present-day southern tip of the island is taken up by the ruins of the temple of Khnum. These, the oldest ruins still standing on the island, are composed of a granite step pyramid from the Third Dynasty and a small temple built for the local Sixth Dynasty nomarch, Heqaib. In the Middle Kingdom, many officials, such as the local governors Sarenput I or Heqaib III, dedicated statues and shrines to the temple.


====Nilometers====
A nilometer was a structure for measuring the Nile River&#x27;s clarity and the water level during the annual flood season. Elephantine has two nilometers. The more famous is a corridor nilometer associated with the temple of Satis, with a stone staircase that descends the corridor. It is one of the oldest nilometers in Egypt, last reconstructed in Roman times and still in use as late as the 19th century AD. Ninety steps that lead down to the river are marked with Arabic, Roman, and hieroglyphic numerals. At the water&#x27;s edge are inscriptions carved deeply into the rock during the Seventeenth Dynasty.

The other nilometer is a rectangular basin located at the island&#x27;s southern tip, near the temple of Khnum and opposite the Old Cataract Hotel. It is probably the older of the two. The Greek historian Strabo mentions one of the nilometers, though it is not certain which.

Many sources claim that the fabled &quot;Well of Eratosthenes&quot;, famous in connection with Eratosthenes&#x27; presumed calculation of the Earth&#x27;s circumference, was located on the island. Strabo mentions a well used to observe that Aswan lies on the Tropic of Cancer, but the reference is to a well at Aswan, not at Elephantine. Neither nilometer at Elephantine is suitable for the purpose, while the well at Aswan is apparently lost.

===Elephantine triad===

The Elephantine triad is between Khnum, Satis, and Anuket; it is debated whether Anuket is the daughter of the two or the sister of Satis. Elephantine was the dwelling place of Khnum, the ram-headed god of the cataracts, who guarded and controlled the waters of the Nile from caves beneath the island.

Satis was worshipped from very early times as a war goddess and protector of this strategic region of Egypt. When seen as a fertility goddess, she personified the bountiful annual flooding of the Nile. The cult of Satis originated in Aswan. Later, when the triad was formed, Khnum became identified as her consort and, thereby, was thought of as the father of Anuket. His role in myths later changed; another deity was ascribed duties with the river. At that time, his role as a potter enabled him to be assigned a duty to create human bodies. Anuket was the goddess of the first cataract, and it is called the personification of the Nile. A cult was formed on the island for Anuket.

==Jewish presence==
The Elephantine papyri and ostraca are caches of legal documents and letters written in Imperial Aramaic dating to sometime in the 5th century BC. These papyri document the presence of a community of Judean mercenaries and their families on Elephantine, starting in the 7th century BCE. The mercenaries guarded the frontier between Egypt and Nubia. Following the 587 BCE destruction of Jerusalem, some Judean refugees traveled south and, in what may be called an “exodus in reverse,” settled on Elephantine. They maintained their own temple (the House of Yahweh) in which sacrifices were offered, evincing polytheistic beliefs, which functioned alongside that of Khnum. It is not clear when or why the Jewish community settled in Elephantine. The temple may have been built in reaction to Manasseh&#x27;s reinstitution of pagan worship or simply to serve the needs of the Jewish community.

===Conflict between Jews and Egyptians===
There is bias that surrounds the Jewish and Egyptian interactions that occurred on Elephantine, but the findings show that there was often culture interchange. Conflict began after an Egyptian precious stone turned up in the hands of the Jews.

The earliest recount of the Jewish temple is from 525 BC. In 410 BC, the Jewish temple, the House of Yahweh, was burned down by a Persian military commander after he was bribed by Khnum priests. While no explicit reason has been given for the destruction of the temple, it is suspected that the priests did this because of the Jewish rituals of sacrificing of sheep, especially during Passover. Papyri records that have been collected from this time show Jewish letters asking Bagoas for help rebuilding the temple.

The standard reference collection of the Aramaic documents of the Elephantine papyri and ostraca is the Textbook of Aramaic Documents from Ancient Egypt.

==Other features==
The Aswan Museum is located at the southern end of the island. Ongoing excavations by the German Archaeological Institute at the island&#x27;s ancient town site have uncovered many findings that are now on display in the museum, including a mummified ram of Khnum. A sizable population of Nubians live in three villages in the island&#x27;s middle section. A large luxury hotel is at the island&#x27;s northern end.

The Aswan Botanical Garden is adjacent to the west on el Nabatat Island.

<doc id="340284" wikidata="Q1748259" url="?curid=340284" title="Electron ionization">
<text>Electron ionization (EI, formerly known as electron impact ionization and electron bombardment ionization) is an ionization method in which energetic electrons interact with solid or gas phase atoms or molecules to produce ions. EI was one of the first ionization techniques developed for mass spectrometry. However, this method is still a popular ionization technique. This technique is considered a hard (high fragmentation) ionization method, since it uses highly energetic electrons to produce ions. This leads to extensive fragmentation, which can be helpful for structure determination of unknown compounds. EI is the most useful for organic compounds which have a molecular weight below 600 amu. Also, several other thermally stable and volatile compounds in solid, liquid and gas states can be detected with the use of this technique when coupled with various separation methods.

== History ==

Electron ionization was first described in 1918 by Canadian-American Physicist Arthur J. Dempster in the article of &quot;A new method of positive ray analysis.&quot; It was the first modern mass spectrometer and used positive rays to determine the ratio of the mass to charge of various constituents. In this method, the ion source used an electron beam directed at a solid surface. The anode was made cylindrical in shape using the metal which was to be studied. Subsequently, it was heated by a concentric coil and then was bombarded with electrons. Using this method, the two isotopes of lithium and three isotopes of magnesium, with their atomic weights and relative proportions, were able to be determined. Since then this technique has been used with further modifications and developments. The use of a focused monoenergetic beam of electrons for ionization of gas phase atoms and molecules was developed by Bleakney in 1929.

==Principle of operation==
In this process, an electron from the analyte molecule (M) is expelled during the collision process to convert the molecule to a positive ion with an odd number of electrons. The following gas phase reaction describes the electron ionization process

:&lt;chem&gt;M{} + e^- -&gt; M^{+\bullet}{} + 2e^-&lt;/chem&gt;

where M is the analyte molecule being ionized, e− is the electron and M+• is the resulting molecular ion.

In an EI ion source, electrons are produced through thermionic emission by heating a wire filament that has electric current running through it. The kinetic energy of the bombarding electrons should have higher energy than the ionization energy of the sample molecule. The electrons are accelerated to 70 eV in the region between the filament and the entrance to the ion source block. The sample under investigation which contains the neutral molecules is introduced to the ion source in a perpendicular orientation to the electron beam. Close passage of highly energetic electrons in low pressure (ca. 10−5 to 10−6 torr) causes large fluctuations in the electric field around the neutral molecules and induces ionization and fragmentation. The fragmentation in electron ionization can be described using Born Oppenheimer potential curves as in the diagram. The red arrow shows the electron impact energy which is enough to remove an electron from the analyte and form a molecular ion from non- dissociative results. Due to the higher energy supplied by 70 eV electrons other than the molecular ion, several other bond dissociation reactions can be seen as dissociative results, shown by the blue arrow in the diagram. These ions are known as second-generation product ions. The radical cation products are then directed towards the mass analyzer by a repeller electrode. The ionization process often follows predictable cleavage reactions that give rise to fragment ions which, following detection and signal processing, convey structural information about the analyte.

=== The efficiency of EI ===
Increasing the electron ionization process is done by increasing the ionization efficiency. In order to achieve higher ionization efficiency there should be an optimized filament current, emission current, and ionizing current. The current supplied to the filament to heat it to incandescent is called the filament current. The emission current is the current measured between the filament and the electron entry slit. The ionizing current is the rate of electron arrival at the trap. It is a direct measure of the number of electrons in the chamber that are available for ionization.

The sample ion current (I+) is the measure of the ionization rate. This can be enhanced by manipulation of the ion extraction efficiency (β), the total ionizing cross section (Qi), the effective ionizing path length (L), the concentration of the sample molecules([N]) and the ionizing current (Ie). The equation can be shown as follows:

:formula_1

The ion extraction efficiency (β) can be optimized by increasing the voltage of both repeller and acceleration. Since the ionization cross section depends on the chemical nature of the sample and the energy of ionizing electrons a standard value of 70 eV is used. At low energies (around 20 eV), the interactions between the electrons and the analyte molecules do not transfer enough energy to cause ionization. At around 70 eV, the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons matches the length of typical bonds in organic molecules (about 0.14 nm) and energy transfer to organic analyte molecules is maximized, leading to the strongest possible ionization and fragmentation. Under these conditions, about 1 in 1000 analyte molecules in the source are ionized. At higher energies, the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons becomes smaller than the bond lengths in typical analytes; the molecules then become &quot;transparent&quot; to the electrons and ionization efficiency decreases. The effective ionizing path length (L) can be increased by using a weak magnetic field. But the most practical way to increase the sample current is to operate the ion source at higher ionizing current (Ie).

A schematic diagram of instrumentation which can be used for electron ionization is shown to the right. The ion source block is made out of metal. As the electron source, the cathode, which can be a thin filament of tungsten or rhenium wire, is inserted through a slit to the source block. Then it is heated up to an incandescent temperature to emit electrons. A potential of 70 V is applied between the cathode and source block to accelerate them to 70 eV kinetic energy to produce positive ions. The potential of the anode (electron trap) is slightly positive and it is placed on the outside of the ionization chamber, directly opposite to the cathode. The unused electrons are collected by this electron trap. The sample is introduced through the sample hole. To increase the ionization process, a weak magnetic field is applied parallel to the direction of the electrons&#x27; travel. Because of this, electrons travel in a narrow helical path, which increases their path length. The positive ions that are generated are accelerated by the repeller electrode into the accelerating region through the slit in the source block. By applying a potential to the ion source and maintaining the exit slit at ground potential, ions enter the mass analyzer with a fixed kinetic energy. To avoid the condensation of the sample, the source block is heated to approximately 300 °C.

== Applications ==
Since the early 20th century electron ionization has been one of the most popular ionization techniques because of the large number of applications it has. These applications can be broadly categorized by the method of sample insertion used. The gaseous and highly volatile liquid samples use a vacuum manifold, solids and less volatile liquids use a direct insertion probe, and complex mixtures use gas chromatography or liquid chromatography.

=== Vacuum manifold ===
In this method the sample is first inserted into a heated sample reservoir in the vacuum manifold. It then escapes into the ionization chamber through a pinhole. This method is useful with highly volatile samples that may not be compatible with other sample introduction methods.

=== Direct insertion EI-MS ===
In this method, the probe is manufactured from a long metal channel which ends in a well for holding a sample capillary. The probe is inserted into the source block through a vacuum lock. The sample is introduced to the well using a glass capillary. Next the probe is quickly heated to the desired temperature to vaporize the sample. Using this probe the sample can be positioned very close to the ionization region.

==== Analysis of archaeologic materials ====
Direct insertion electron ionization mass spectrometry (direct insertion EI-MS) has been used for the identification of archeological adhesives such as tars, resins and waxes found during excavations on archeological sites. These samples are typically investigated using gas chromatography–MS with extraction, purification, and derivatization of the samples. Due to the fact that these samples were deposited in prehistoric periods, they are often preserved in small amounts. By using direct insertion EI–MS archaeological samples, ancient organic remains like pine and pistacia resins, birch bark tar, beeswax, and plant oils as far from bronze and Iron Age periods were directly analyzed. The advantage of this technique is that the required amount of sample is less and the sample preparation is minimized.

Both direct insertion-MS and gas chromatography-MS were used and compared in a study of characterization of the organic material present as coatings in Roman and Egyptian amphoras can be taken as an example of archeological resinous materials. From this study, it reveals that, the direct insertion procedure seems to be a fast, straightforward and a unique tool which is suitable for screening of organic archeological materials which can reveal information about the major constituents within the sample. This method provides information on the degree of oxidation and the class of materials present. As a drawback of this method, less abundant components of the sample may not be identified.

==== Characterization of synthetic carbon clusters ====
Another application of direct insertion EI-MS is the characterization of novel synthetic carbon clusters isolated in the solid phase. These crystalline materials consist of C60 and C70 in the ratio of 37:1. In one investigation it has been shown that the synthetic C60 molecule is remarkably stable and that it retains its aromatic character.

=== Gas chromatography mass spectrometry ===
Gas chromatography (GC) is the most widely used method in EI-MS for sample insertion. GC can be incorporated for the separation of mixtures of thermally stable and volatile gases which are in perfect match with the electron ionization conditions.

==== Analysis of archaeologic materials ====
The GC-EI-MS has been used for the study and characterization of organic material present in coatings on Roman and Egyptian amphorae. From this analysis scientists found that the material used to waterproof the amphorae was a particular type of resin not native to the archaeological site but imported from another region. One disadvantage of this method was the long analysis time and requirement of wet chemical pre-treatment.

==== Environmental analysis ====
GC-EI-MS has been successfully used for the determination of pesticide residues in fresh food by a single injection analysis. In this analysis 81 multi-class pesticide residues were identified in vegetables. For this study the pesticides were extracted with dichloromethane and further analyzed using gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS–MS). The optimum ionization method can be identified as EI or chemical ionization (CI) for this single injection of the extract. This method is fast, simple and cost effective since high numbers of pesticides can be determined by GC with a single injection, considerably reducing the total time for the analysis.

==== Analysis of biological fluids ====
The GC-EI-MS can be incorporated for the analysis of biological fluids for several applications. One example is the determination of thirteen synthetic pyrethroid insecticide molecules and their stereoisomers in whole blood. This investigation used a new rapid and sensitive electron ionization-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry method in selective ion monitoring mode (SIM) with a single injection of the sample. All the pyrethroid residues were separated by using a GC-MS operated in electron ionization mode and quantified in selective ion monitoring mode. The detection of specific residues in blood is a difficult task due to their very low concentration since as soon as they enter the body most of the chemicals may get excreted. However, this method detected the residues of different pyrethroids down to the level 0.05–2 ng/ml. The detection of this insecticide in blood is very important since an ultra-small quantity in the body is enough to be harmful to human health, especially in children. This method is a very simple, rapid technique and therefore can be adopted without any matrix interferences. The selective ion monitoring mode provides detection sensitivity up to 0.05 ng/ml. Another application is in protein turnover studies using GC-EI-MS. This measures very low levels of d-phenylalanine which can indicate the enrichment of amino acid incorporated into tissue protein during studies of human protein synthesis. This method is very efficient since both free and protein-bound d-phenylalanine can be measured using the same mass spectrometer and only a small amount of protein is needed (about 1 mg).

==== Forensic applications ====
The GC-EI-MS is also used in forensic science. One example is the analysis of five local anesthetics in blood using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry–electron impact ionization selected ion monitoring (GC–MS–EI-SIM). Local anesthesia is widely used but sometimes these drugs can cause medical accidents. In such cases an accurate, simple, and rapid method for the analysis of local anesthetics is required. GC-EI-MS was used in one case with an analysis time of 65 minutes and a sample size of approximately 0.2 g, a relatively small amount. Another application in forensic practice is the determination of date rape drugs (DRDs) in urine. These drugs are used to incapacitate victims and then rape or rob them. The analyses of these drugs are difficult due to the low concentrations in the body fluids and often a long time delay between the event and clinical examination. However, using GC-EI-MS allows a simple, sensitive and robust method for the identification, detection and quantification of 128 compounds of DRDs in urine.

=== Liquid chromatography EI-MS ===
Two recent approaches for coupling capillary scale liquid chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry (LC-EI-MS) can be incorporated for the analysis of various samples. These are capillary-scale EI-based LC/MS interface and direct-EI interface. In the capillary EI the nebulizer has been optimized for linearity and sensitivity. The direct-EI interface is a miniaturized interface for nano- and micro-HPLC in which the interfacing process takes place in a suitably modified ion source. Higher sensitivity, linearity, and reproducibility can be obtained because the elution from the column is completely transferred into the ion source. Using these two interfaces electron ionization can be successfully incorporated for the analysis of small and medium-sized molecules with various polarities. The most common applications for these interfaces in LC-MS are environmental applications such as gradient separations of the pesticides, carbaryl, propanil, and chlorpropham using a reversed phase, and pharmaceutical applications such as separation of four anti-inflammatory drugs, diphenyldramine, amitriptyline, naproxen, and ibuprofen.

Another method to categorize the applications of electron ionization is based on the separation technique which is used in mass spectroscopy. According to this category most of the time applications can be found in time of flight (TOF) or orthogonal TOF mass spectrometry (OA-TOF MS), Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR MS) and quadrupole or ion trap mass spectrometry.

=== Use with time-of-flight mass spectrometry ===
The electron ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy (EI-TOF MS) is well suited for analytical and basic chemical physics studies. EI-TOF MS is used to find ionization potentials of molecules and radicals, as well as bond dissociation energies for ions and neutral molecules. Another use of this method is to study about negative ion chemistry and physics. Autodetachment lifetimes, metastable dissociation, Rydberg electron transfer reactions and field detachment, SF6 scavenger method for detecting temporary negative ion states, and many others have all been discovered using this technique. In this method the field free ionization region allows for high precision in the electron energy and also high electron energy resolution. Measuring the electric fields down the ion flight tube determines autodetachment and metastable decomposition as well as field detachment of weakly bound negative ions.

The first description of an electron ionization orthogonal-acceleration TOF MS (EI oa-TOFMS) was in 1989. By using &quot;orthogonal-acceleration&quot; with the EI ion source the resolving power and sensitivity was increased. One of the key advantage of oa-TOFMS with EI sources is for deployment with gas chromatographic (GC) inlet systems, which allows chromatographic separation of volatile organic compounds to proceed at high speed.

=== Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ===
FT- ICR EI - MS can be used for analysis of three vacuum gas oil (VGO) distillation fractions in 295-319 °C, 319-456 °C and 456-543 °C. In this method, EI at 10 eV allows soft ionization of aromatic compounds in the vacuum gas oil range. The compositional variations at the molecular level were determined from the elemental composition assignment. Ultra-high resolving power, small sample size, high reproducibility and mass accuracy (&lt;0.4ppm) are the special features in this method. The major product was aromatic hydrocarbons in all three samples. In addition, many sulfur-, nitrogen-, and oxygen-containing compounds were directly observed when the concentration of this heteroatomic species increased with the boiling point. Using data analysis it gave the information about compound types (rings plus double bonds), their carbon number distributions for hydrocarbon and heteroatomic compounds in the distillation fractions, increasing average molecular weight (or carbon number distribution) and aromaticity with increasing boiling temperature of the petroleum fractions.

=== Ion trap mass spectrometry ===
Ion trap EI MS can be incorporated for the identification and quantitation of nonylphenol polyethoxylate (NPEO) residues and their degradation products such as nonylphenol polyethoxy carboxylates and carboxyalkylphenol ethoxy carboxylates, in the samples of river water and sewage effluent. Form this research, they have found out that the ion trap GC- MS is a reliable and convenient analytical approach with variety of ionization methods including EI, for the determination of target compounds in environmental samples.

<text>Johan Theron (born c. 1943) was a former information officer in South Africa&#x27;s apartheid government&#x27;s Special Forces. Theron testified before South Africa&#x27;s High Court during the trial of Wouter Basson for human rights crimes. Theron told the court that he had personally caused or supervised the murders of over 200 anti-apartheid political prisoners between 1979 and 1987. He claimed that the murders were merely a part of his job.

At the conclusion of the Wouter Basson trial in 2002, the presiding magistrate, Justice Hatzenburg, refused to grant Johan Theron indemnity from prosecution. Subsequent to the Basson trial, Theron never bothered to apply for amnesty from the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) as he was never formally charged with the crimes he claimed to have committed.

<text>The BAC One-Eleven (BAC-111, BAC 1-11) is an early jet airliner produced by the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC).

Originally conceived by Hunting Aircraft as a 30-seat jet, before its merger into BAC in 1960, it was launched as an 80-seat airliner with a British United Airways (BUA) order on 9 May 1961.
The prototype conducted its maiden flight on 20 August 1963, and it was first delivered to BUA on 22 January 1965.
The 119-seat, stretched 500 series was introduced in 1967.
Total production amounted to 244 until 1982 in the United Kingdom and between 1982 and 1989 in Romania where nine Rombac One-Elevens were licence-built by Romaero.
The short haul, narrowbody aircraft was powered by aft-mounted Rolls-Royce Spey low-bypass turbofans, a configuration similar to the earlier Sud Aviation Caravelle and later Douglas DC-9.

It competed with early Boeing 737 variants and was used by multiple British, European and US airlines, including Romanian operators.
It was replaced by the newer Airbus A320 and later 737 variants, as well as by the Bombardier CRJ200 regional jet.
Noise restrictions accelerated its transition to African carriers in the 1990s, and the last BAC One-Eleven was retired in 2019.

==Development==

===Early development===
In the 1950s, although the pioneering de Havilland Comet had suffered disasters in service, strong passenger demand had been demonstrated for jet propulsion. Several manufacturers raced to release passenger jets, including those aimed at the short-haul market, such as the Sud Aviation Caravelle. In July 1956, British European Airways published a paper calling for a &quot;second generation&quot; jet airliner to operate beside their existing turboprop designs. This led to a variety of designs from the British aerospace industry. Hunting Aircraft started design studies on a jet-powered replacement for the successful Vickers Viscount, developing the 30-seat Hunting 107. Around the same time, Vickers started a similar development of a 140-seat derivative of its VC10 project, the VC11. Many other aviation firms also produced designs.

In 1960 Hunting, under British government pressure, merged with Vickers-Armstrongs, Bristol, and English Electric to form British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). The new BAC decided that the Hunting project had merit, but that there would be little market for a 30-seat jet airliner. The design was reworked into the BAC 107, a 59-seat airliner powered by two Bristol Siddeley BS75 turbofan engines. BAC also continued development of the larger, 140-seat VC-11 development of the Vickers VC10 which it had inherited. Other competing internal projects, such as the Bristol Type 200, were quickly abandoned following absorption of Hunting into BAC.

Market research showed the 59-seat BAC 107 was too small, and the design was reworked in 1961, with passenger capacity growing to 80 seats, and BS75s being discarded in favour of Rolls-Royce Speys. The revised design was redesignated the BAC 111 (later known as the One-Eleven), with BAC abandoning the VC11 project to concentrate on the more promising One-Eleven. Unlike contemporary British airliners such as the Hawker Siddeley Trident, the One-Eleven was not designed specifically to meet the needs of the state-owned British European Airways or British Overseas Airways Corporation, but on the needs of airlines around the world, and BAC expected orders for as many as 400.

On 9 May 1961 the One-Eleven was publicly launched when British United Airways placed the first order for ten One-Eleven 200s. On 20 October Braniff International Airways in the United States ordered six. Mohawk Airlines sent representatives to Europe seeking out a new aircraft to bring them into the jet era, and on 24 July 1962 concluded an agreement for four One-Elevens. Orders followed from Kuwait Airways for three, and Central African Airways for two. Braniff subsequently doubled their order to 12, while Ireland&#x27;s Aer Lingus ordered four. Western Airlines ordered ten but later cancelled. Bonanza Air Lines also ordered three in 1962 but was stopped by the US Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which claimed that subsidies would be needed to operate a jet on Bonanza&#x27;s routes, an action claimed by some at the time to be protectionism. The CAB also stopped Frontier Airlines and Ozark Air Lines from ordering One-Elevens, although allowing Ozark to order the similar Douglas DC-9 and Frontier to order Boeing 727-100s. The CAB had also unsuccessfully tried to block Mohawk&#x27;s orders.

In May 1963, BAC announced the One-Eleven 300 and 400. The new versions used the Mk. 511 version of the Spey with increased power, allowing more fuel upload and hence longer range. The difference between the 300 and 400 lay in the equipment and avionics, the 400 intended for sales in the United States and thus equipped with US instruments. On 17 July 1963, American Airlines ordered 15 aircraft, bringing the total to 60, plus options for 15. American Airlines eventually bought 30 of the 400-series, making the airline the largest customer of One-Elevens.

===Prototypes===
The prototype (&quot;G-ASHG&quot;) rolled out of Hurn assembly hall on 28 July 1963, at which point BAC had received orders for the type from a number of operators. On 20 August 1963, the prototype conducted its first flight, painted in BUA livery. The first flight had taken place almost a year before the Douglas DC-9, a rival American jetliner; BAC considered the One-Eleven to hold a technological edge. The One-Eleven&#x27;s lead was of significant importance commercially, since, as shown by the Bonanza Air Lines case, US authorities could refuse to approve sales of foreign aircraft to domestic airlines where an American alternative existed (Bonanza ended up ordering and operating the DC-9). Test flying was conducted by Squadron Leader Dave Glaser.

The One-Eleven prototype, flown by test pilot Mike Lithgow, crashed on 22 October 1963 during stall testing, with the loss of all on board. The investigation led to the discovery of what became known as deep stall or superstall, a phenomenon caused by reduced airflow to the tailplane caused by the combined blanking effects of the wing and the aft-mounted engine nacelles at high angles of attack, which prevents recovery of normal (nose-down) flight. To prevent such stalls, BAC designed and added devices known as stick shakers and stick pushers to the One-Eleven&#x27;s control system. It also redesigned the wing&#x27;s leading edge to smooth airflow into the engines and over the tailplane. The specially modified aircraft used for testing this problem is now preserved at Brooklands Museum.

Despite the crash, testing continued and customer confidence remained high. American Airlines and Braniff took up their optional orders and placed more in February 1964. Further orders came from Mohawk, Philippine Airlines and German businessman Helmut Horten, who ordered the first executive modification of the aircraft. By the end of 1964, 13 aircraft had rolled off the production line. The One-Eleven was certified and the first handover, of &quot;G-ASJI&quot; to BUA, was on 22 January 1965. After several weeks of route-proving flights, the first revenue service flew on 9 April from Gatwick to Genoa. Braniff took delivery of its first aircraft on 11 March, while Mohawk received its first on 15 May. Deliveries continued, and by the end of 1965 airlines had received 34 aircraft. Demand remained buoyant, with a second production line set up at Weybridgeproducing thirteen 1-11s between 1966 and 1970.

===The One-Eleven 500, 510ED and 475===
In 1967 a larger 119-seat version was introduced as the One-Eleven 500 (also known as Super One-Eleven). This &quot;stretched&quot; version was delayed for at least a year while its launch customer BEA assessed its requirements. This gave competing US aircraft (the Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 737) the opportunity to compensate for the One-Eleven&#x27;s early penetration of the US domestic market. The British aircraft&#x27;s initial one-year advantage now turned into a one-year delay, and the stretched series 500 failed to sell in the US. The type saw service with Cayman Airways and Leeward Islands Air Transport (LIAT) in the Caribbean with Cayman Airways operating the series 500 on scheduled services to Houston, Texas (IAH) and Miami, Florida (MIA), and LIAT flying its series 500s into San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU). Bahamasair also operated the stretched 500 model with service between Nassau (NAS) and Miami among other routes while Guatemalan carrier Aviateca operated its series 500 aircraft into both Miami and New Orleans, Louisiana (MSY). Costa Rican airline LACSA operated the series 500 as well on its services to Miami. Another air carrier which operated the series 500 into Miami was Belize Airways Ltd.

Compared with earlier versions, the One-Eleven 500 was longer by 8 ft 4in (2.54 m) ahead of the wing and 5 ft 2in (1.57 m) behind it. The wing span was increased by 5 ft (1.5 m), and the latest Mk. 512 version of the Spey was used. The new version sold reasonably well across the world, particularly to European charter airlines. In 1971 it received an incremental upgrade to reduce drag and reduce runway requirements.

BEA/British Airways 500 series aircraft (denoted &quot;One-Eleven 510ED&quot;) varied significantly from other One-Elevens, at BEA&#x27;s request. The One-Eleven 510ED had a modified cockpit which incorporated instrumentation and avionics from or similar to that of the Hawker Siddeley Trident, for better commonality with the type. Their additional equipment included a more sophisticated autopilot, which allowed autoland in CAT II and included an autothrottle. The modifications went as far as reversing the &quot;on&quot; position of most switches to match that of the Trident; indeed, the 510ED was so different from other One-Elevens and 500 series aircraft that a different type rating was required to fly it.

Having faced competition from US aircraft by 1966, by 1970 the One-Eleven also faced competition from newer, smaller aircraft such as the Fokker F28 Fellowship. The F28 was lighter, less complex, and cheaper. The One-Eleven 475 of 1970 was launched to compete with the F28. It combined the 400 fuselage with the higher power and larger wing of the 500 and was intended for hot and high as well as rough airfield operations; however only ten One-Eleven Mk 475s were sold with one airline being Faucett Peru which operated its series 475 aircraft on scheduled domestic services into several airports with unpaved gravel runways in Peru. In 1977, the One-Eleven 670, a quiet and updated 475, was offered to the Japanese domestic market, also failing to sell.

===Proposed developments===

Total deliveries for 1965 were 34 aircraft, while 200 aircraft had been built by the end of 1971. At this point orders slowed to a trickle, with production being suspended in 1975, although marketing and design continued, and it was always planned to restart production when sufficient orders had been received. BAC restarted production in 1977 as a result of an order for five aircraft by the Romanian airline Tarom. British production continued until 1984, with a total of 235 aircraft built in Britain. There were two reasons why the production line was kept open for just 35 aircraft delivered over 11 years: first, BAC hoped that Rolls-Royce would develop a quieter and more powerful version of the Spey engine, making possible further One-Eleven developments; second, throughout the early part of the period Romania was negotiating to buy the entire One-Eleven programme and transfer production of the type to Bucharest.

By 1974, BAC invested significant effort into launching the One-Eleven 700. This had a longer fuselage with a 134-seat interior and the projected Spey 606 engine producing greater power and less noise. The 700J was planned for the Japanese market, with the same stretched fuselage and engines as the 700 and a new high-lift wing for operation into regional airports with short runways. The 700 was approximately the same size as the latest DC-9s and 737s and would have been available in time to prevent large-scale defections by One-Eleven clients to McDonnell-Douglas and Boeing. Rolls-Royce was still recovering from bankruptcy, however, and the uprated Spey failed to materialise. An altogether less ambitious 700 made a reappearance in 1978 as a 500 with specially &quot;hush-kitted&quot; Speys which would be replaced by the proposed RB432 in the mid-1980s. This was offered to British Airways in competition with Boeing 737-200s, but was ultimately rejected.

In 1975, BAC launched the One-Eleven 800, a further stretched aircraft to be powered by two CFM International CFM56 high-bypass turbofans and seating 144 to 161 passengers, but this project was abandoned in 1976 in favour of a new derivative of the One-Eleven with a wider fuselage capable of six-abreast seating. This new airliner was unveiled later that year as the X-Eleven, which would be powered by two CFM-56s or Pratt &amp; Whitney JT10D engines and seat up 166 passengers. In 1977, BAC merged with Hawker Siddeley to form British Aerospace (BAe) and the new company was faced with the choice of developing the X-Eleven or joining European efforts to design an-all new aircraft. In the end, BAe became a full member of Airbus, and the X-Eleven was abandoned, with the European alternative becoming the Airbus A320.

The BAC Two-Eleven and Three-Eleven were British airliner studies proposed by the British Aircraft Corporation in the late 1960s which never made it to production.

===Rombac production===
On 9 June 1979, Romanian president Nicolae Ceaușescu signed a contract for One-Eleven licence production in Romania. This was to involve the delivery of three complete One-Elevens (two 500-series aircraft and one 475 series) plus the construction of at least 22 in Bucharest, with the reduction of British (and thus increase of Romanian) content. It also involved Romanian production of Rolls-Royce Spey engines and certification of the aircraft to British standards by the Civil Aviation Authority. A market for up to 80 Romanian-built aircraft was projected at the time, largely in China and other developing economies, and possibly Eastern Europe. The aircraft was redesignated Rombac 1-11. The Spey 512-14 DW engines were produced under license by Turbomecanica Bucharest.

The first Rombac One-Eleven, (YR-BRA cn 401) a series 561RC, was rolled out at Romaero Băneasa factory on 27 August 1982 and first flew on 18 September 1982. Production continued until 1989 at a much slower pace than foreseen in the contract. Nine aircraft were delivered, with the 10th and 11th aircraft on the production line being abandoned when they were 85% and 70% complete. The first aircraft was delivered to TAROM on 29 December 1982. The Romanian carrier took delivery of all but two of the aircraft produced, the remaining two going to Romavia, the last of which (YR-BRI cn 409) was delivered on 1 January 1993.

There were three reasons why the Rombac initiative failed. Romania&#x27;s economy and international position deteriorated to the point where supplies needed for One-Eleven manufacturing slowed to a trickle, with hard currency restrictions delaying the delivery of components sourced outside Romania; the market foreseen by the Romanians failed to show an interest, though some Rombac machines were leased to European operators. The One-Eleven&#x27;s noise level and fuel economy failed to keep pace with US and West European competition.

Adopting a new engine would have resolved noise and fuel economy issues. Following the fall of the Ceaușescu regime, plans were made to restart production using the Rolls-Royce Tay. British aircraft leasing company Associated Aerospace agreed a $1 billion deal to purchase 50 Tay-powered One-Elevens fitted with a new electronic glass cockpit for onward leasing to Western customers. The liquidation of Associated Aerospace in April 1991 stopped this deal. Despite this setback, Rombac continued to try to sell the One-Eleven, with US operator Kiwi International Air Lines placing a firm order for 11 Tay-engined aircraft with options for an additional five, but these plans never happened.

==Operational history==
Once in service, the One Eleven found itself in competition with the Douglas DC-9, and was joined by another competitor, the Boeing 737, only a year after its introduction. Advantages over the DC-9 included a lower unit cost. The DC-9 offered more seating, and its engines were interchangeable with those on the Boeing 727. These factors led to Trans Australia Airlines choosing to purchase the DC-9 instead. In the US, the Civil Aeronautics Board was sceptical of smaller operators&#x27; need for jet aircraft and withheld financing, leading to several US customers cancelling their One-Eleven orders.

Mohawk Airlines became both the first American operator of the type and the first airline in the US to operate jet aircraft on short haul routes. On 25 June 1965, Mohawk introduced its first One-Eleven into passenger service; by the end of the decade, the airline operated a fleet of 20 BAC One-Elevens. Buying the jets pushed Mohawk into debt and this, along with an economic downturn and strike action, led to its forced merger with Allegheny Airlines which in turn continued to operate the One-Eleven. In July 1963, American Airlines had placed an order for 15 400-series One-Elevens for £14 million; this was the first time American Airlines had purchased a foreign aircraft type for its fleet. Braniff International Airways, another major US air carrier, also ordered the One-Eleven. Aloha Airlines selected the One-Eleven as its first jet type for interisland service in the Hawaiian Islands.

Several British operators, including Dan Air and British Caledonian, made extensive use of the type. Dan Air increased the number of One-Elevens it had in service in the 1970s, eventually replacing its aging de Havilland Comets with the One-Eleven entirely in the 1980s. The type became the airline&#x27;s main revenue generator. Dan Air would often lease One-Elevens, including Rombac-produced aircraft, to meet short-term demands. During periods of low demand Dan Air would lease its own One-Elevens to other operators. British Caledonian and Dan Air One-Elevens would often be exchanged between the two airlines on temporary and permanent arrangements. Passenger demand grew on several key One-Eleven routes, exceeding the Series 500&#x27;s larger capacity during the 1980s, which began to force airlines to use other planes.

Before the formation of British Airways (BA), some predecessor companies, British European Airways and Cambrian Airways, were operating the One-Eleven. Their fleets were inherited by BA. British Airways Regional Division found the performance of the One-Eleven more than adequate and sought to expand operations with the type, including further acquisitions, in the early 1970s in part to replace Vickers Viscounts. BA&#x27;s 400-Series One-Elevens were all named after areas and locations in the English Midlands, reflecting the type&#x27;s new base at Birmingham Airport. BA ordered more Series-500 aircraft in the late 1970s and the airline received some of the last British-made One-Elevens.

British Caledonian had begun replacing its One-Elevens with the new Airbus A320, when it was merged with British Airways in 1987 due to financial problems. In both Caledonian and British Airways service, the One-Elevens were a dominant type for the operator&#x27;s European routes. BA proceeded to rationalise its fleets, retiring many overlapping types, the One-Eleven being gradually phased out for the more modern A320 and Boeing 737 jetliners. The last aircraft was removed from regular service with BA in October 1992. A number of ex-BA aircraft saw service with Maersk Air before, in turn, being replaced by the Bombardier CRJ200 in the late 1990s.
In Ireland Aer Lingus flew One-Elevens for three decades, in both the scheduled and charter markets. The aircraft was used on less-busy European routes into the 1990s. The One-Eleven was important in budget airline Ryanair&#x27;s early years: it had sought an aircraft for low-fare scheduled services from regional airports, and obtained One-Elevens. The first of these, a Rombac-produced 500-Series, entered service on the Dublin–Luton route on 1 December 1986. Ryanair&#x27;s fleet expanded to six aircraft by 1988, with three leased from Romania. These leased aircraft were later replaced with former BA One-Elevens. Ultimately Ryanair replaced the One-Eleven with the Boeing 737 in the mid-1990s.

In April 1966, Philippine Airlines began operating One Elevens in revenue service. They eventually operated 12 of the later 500-Series. One of these aircraft suffered two separate in-flight bomb explosions, but was repaired each time and continued in service until 1992. In another high-profile incident on 21 May 1982, John Clearno tried to hijack a Philippine One-Eleven while on the ground, but was eventually overpowered by the cockpit crew following hours of negotiation. No passengers or crew were injured. Philippine Airlines replaced the type with the Boeing 737 from 1989 onwards.

Romania was a major customer for British-produced One-Elevens, with several large orders in the 1970s. These aircraft were often fitted with equipment such as engine &#x27;hush kits&#x27;. In May 1977, a major cooperation agreement between British Aerospace and the Romanian government was signed, and this led to a gradual One-Eleven technology transfer to Romania. Full contracts for licence production under the Rombac name followed two years later. Complete airframes and components were provided to assist in the venture. All Rombac One-Elevens manufactured by Romaero were delivered to TAROM and Romavia, which leased them to airlines across both Eastern and Western Europe. Rombac-produced One-Elevens would be adopted by many emerging operators globally, including Lauda Air in Austria, and Aero Asia International in Pakistan. Two planes served as the private jets of Romanian communist leaders Nicolae Ceaușescu and Ion Iliescu during 1986 to 1989. Due to the planes are &quot;extreme rarity and significance for the technical history of Romania,&quot; they were added to the “treasure” category of Romania’s mobile cultural heritage in 2021, not allowed to leave the country. Under the BAC licence, 9 planes were made in Romania. Some of them served in a small airline, LAR, its sole destination being Tel Aviv.

One-Elevens remained in widespread use with European operators into the 1990s. Once retired from major operators, they were often sold to smaller airlines, often in the Far East and Africa. Nigeria was a major operator until the type was grounded after a crash in 2002. A major factor for the withdrawal from European service of remaining One-Elevens was the Stage III noise abatement regulations, which came into effect from March 2003. Bringing the Rolls-Royce Spey engines into compliance with the noise regulations with hush kits was expensive, and many European operators chose to dispose of the type from their fleets. In 2010, the European Aviation Safety Agency accepted an Airbus request to revoke the Type Certificate for the BAC One-Eleven. As a result, BAC One-Eleven aircraft registered in any EU Member State are no longer eligible for a normal certificate of airworthiness. In December 2012, the last operational One-Eleven in the UK, which had continued to fly as a military aircraft, was retired. Eventually, on 7 May 2019, the last flyable One-Eleven was retired by Northrop Grumman after serving as an F-35 testbed.

==Notable accidents and incidents==
===Accidents with fatalities===
* On 22 October 1963, a prototype aircraft crashed during a test flight, while testing stall conditions near Chicklade in Wiltshire, England. All seven crew members were killed. This was not a production-model plane and this incident is described more fully in the Development section above.
* On 6 August 1966, Braniff International Airways Flight 250 disintegrated in mid-air after flying into a severe thunderstorm near Falls City, Nebraska. It was en route to Omaha, Nebraska, from Kansas City, Missouri. Thirty-eight passengers and four crew members were killed in the crash. The plane was a BAC One-Eleven-203AE.
* On 23 June 1967, a Mohawk Airlines One-Eleven-204AF while flying Mohawk Airlines Flight 40 suffered a loss of pitch control following an on-board fire that caused heavy damage in the tail area. Flight 40 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight between Elmira, New York and Washington, DC. It crashed outside Blossburg, Pennsylvania with the loss of all 34 passengers and crew. The fire was traced to the auxiliary power unit (APU); as a direct result of this accident in-flight use of the APU was banned.
* On 12 September 1969, a Philippine Airlines BAC One-Eleven registration PI-C1131 operating as Flight 158 en route from Mactan–Cebu International Airport in Cebu to Manila International Airport (now Ninoy Aquino Airport) in Manila, Philippines struck a mango tree on the hill in suburban Kula-ike, Antipolo, Rizal, east of its destination while on a VOR approach to runway 24. There were 47 people on board, of which 45 were killed. One passenger and one flight steward survived, but both were hospitalized with burns. The crash was the worst air disaster in the Philippines involving commercial aircraft until 1987.
* On 7 December 1970, a TAROM One-Eleven 424EU flying from Tel Aviv to Bucharest crashed on approach to the Mihail Kogălniceanu International Airport after having been diverted from its original destination. The accident occurred due to deteriorating weather and 19 of the 24 occupants were killed.
* On 6 September 1971, a One-Eleven 515FB operating as Paninternational Flight 112 collided with a bridge during an emergency landing on the A7 Autobahn in Hamburg, shearing off both wings after a double engine failure during takeoff. The water injection system had inadvertently been filled with jet fuel instead of water. Twenty-two of the 121 people aboard died.
* On 18 April 1974, Court Line Flight 95, operated by One-Eleven 528 G-AXMJ was involved in a ground collision with Piper PA-23 Aztec G-AYDE at London Luton Airport due to the Aztec entering the active runway without clearance. The pilot of the Aztec was killed and his passenger was injured. All 91 on board the One-Eleven safely left the aircraft after take-off was aborted.
* On 21 November 1977, Austral Líneas Aéreas Flight 9 flying from Buenos Aires to San Carlos de Bariloche, suffered pressurisation problems whilst climbing to 35,000 feet. Later on approach into San Carlos de Bariloche International Airport, the plane struck terrain and crashed. All five crew and 41 of 74 passengers were killed.
* On 7 May 1981, Austral Líneas Aéreas Flight 901 crashed on approach into Jorge Newbery Airport, Buenos Aires, after a flight from San Miguel de Tucumán. The likely cause was the weather and pilot error. All 5 crew and 26 passengers were killed.
* On 21 July 1989, Philippine Airlines Flight 124 overran the runway when attempting a landing at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Manila. None of the 98 passengers on board were killed, but eight people on the ground died when the aircraft came to a stop on an adjacent highway.
* On 26 June 1991, ran out of fuel while on approach to Sokoto Airport and crashed during a forced landing, killing four passengers.
* On 18 September 1994, an Oriental Airlines flight carrying Nigerian football team Iwuanyanwu Nationale FC home from a CAF Champions League quarterfinals match in Tunis crashed on its fourth landing attempt at Tamanrasset Airport. Five people on board died, including three crew and two passengers, both footballers for the team.
* On 29 July 1997, overshot the runway while landing at Calabar Airport, killing one person.
* On 4 May 2002, EAS Airlines Flight 4226 crashed in a suburb of Kano, Nigeria, shortly after takeoff, killing 73 of the 77 people on board and 30 more on the ground. This remains the worst crash of a BAC One-Eleven, with a total of 103 deaths.

===Other incidents===
* On 9 July 1978, Allegheny Airlines Flight 453 crash-landed at Greater Rochester International Airport while arriving from Boston Logan International Airport. The aircraft was carrying 77 people. According to the NTSB report, the flight landed on Runway 28 at too high a speed, but with sufficient performance capability to reject the landing. The pilots chose to continue the landing, the aircraft skidded off the end of the runway, and its landing gear were sheared off by a ditch. There were no fatalities but the aircraft was written off.
* On 4 August 1984, a Philippine Airlines flight overshot runway 36 and ended up in the sea when attempting a landing at Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport, Tacloban City, Philippines. All 70 passengers and five crew survived.
* On 10 June 1990, British Airways Flight 5390&#x27;s cockpit window blew out at altitude after incorrect bolts had been used to secure it. Captain Tim Lancaster was blown half out of the cockpit by the pressure differential; members of the cabin crew clung to his legs to keep him from being blown out of the aircraft. The plane made an emergency landing at Southampton Airport. The pilot survived, as did all the crew and passengers. An investigation revealed that the shift maintenance manager had used incorrect bolts as they were similar to the bolts which had been previously used on the aircraft; he replaced them at a like for like ratio. 84 of the 90 bolts used to secure the window were too small in diameter, whilst the remaining six were too short in length.

<doc id="340289" wikidata="Q6071608" url="?curid=340289" title="Irish language in Northern Ireland">
<text>The Irish language () is, since 2022, an official language in Northern Ireland. The main dialect spoken there is Ulster Irish (&quot;Gaeilge or Gaeilg Uladh&quot;). Protection for the Irish language in Northern Ireland stems largely from the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

In the 2021 census, Irish was the main language of 0.3% of the population aged 3 and up, an increase from 0.2% in the previous survey,
while 12.4% of that population had some ability in Irish, also an increase from previous census results. As well, for the first time, the census asked the frequency of speaking Irish. 43,557 said they spoke Irish on a daily basis, which accounts for 2.43% of Northern Ireland&#x27;s population.

==History==
===Language in Gaelic Ireland===
As in other parts of Ireland, Irish was the main language in the region of present-day Northern Ireland for most of its recorded history. The historic influence of the Irish language in Northern Ireland can be seen in many place names, for example the name of Belfast first appears in the year 668, and the Lagan even earlier (&quot;Logia&quot;, Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; 2,2,8). The Plantation of Ulster led to a decline in Gaelic culture, of which Irish was part – while some Scottish settlers were Scots-Gaelic speakers, English was made widespread by the plantation. Despite the plantation Irish continued to be spoken in non-planted areas until the mass immigration in the 19th century caused by economic factors (see below for further).

===Irish Revival in the North===
Intellectuals in Belfast took an antiquarian interest in Irish-language culture towards the end of the 18th century, and an Irish-language magazine &quot;Bolg an tSolair&quot; was published in 1795. The Ulster Gaelic Society was founded in 1830. Attitudes among the Anglican and Presbyterian middle class, however, changed in the second half of the 19th century as the Gaelic Revival began being associated with support for Home Rule or Irish Republicanism. The English-born MP for South Londonderry, Thomas Lea proposed an amendment to the draft of the second Home Rule Bill that would have prevented the passing of laws which would increase Irish language use in state schools, legal courts and other public spheres. A branch of the Gaelic League was founded in Belfast in 1895 with a non-sectarian and widely based membership, but the decline in Irish as a first language continued.

Irish was in sharp decline throughout the whole of Ireland from the mid-1800s. From the late 1600s and early 1700s, the Church of Ireland made some attempts to revive the declining Irish language. The church printed Bibles and Prayer Books in Irish, and some churches, and some Protestant clergymen like William King of Dublin, held services in the language. However, the English language had been the language of learning and the Roman Catholic Church continued to use Ecclesiastical Latin for Mass and English in sermons. English was the language of the industrial east of the island, and Irish started to become confined to the more rural west. The proportion of Irish speakers had fallen from about half of the population in 1800 to 23% by 1851, and with only about a third of these speaking it exclusively.

By the 1860s, of all the Roman Catholic seminaries, only St Jarlath&#x27;s in Tuam was teaching in Irish. The Roman Catholic Church had, at that time, desired to &quot;stamp out any lingering, semi-pagan remnants&quot;, which included the Irish language. Sir William Wilde in 1852 accordingly blamed the Catholic Church for the quick decline and was &quot;shocked&quot; by the rapid decline of both the language and Gaelic customs after the Famine.

The power of the English language, in business and learning throughout much of the world also influenced the decline of Irish in Ireland. A letter from Dennis Heraghty of Letterkenny in 1886 to the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language complained that the parents in his area all wanted their children to learn English. Bishop MacCormac of Achonry, also in 1886, suggested that &quot;People are apathetic about the preservation of our ancient language&quot; and, &quot;They see that Shakespeare&#x27;s tongue is the one in use in America and the Colonies.&quot;

Although there had been attempts and societies formed to reverse the declining trend for the language, it was not until the rise of the Gaelic League, founded in 1893, that any measure of success was achieved. 

Douglas Hyde, in New York in 1905, said, &quot;The Irish language, thank God, is neither Protestant nor Catholic, it is neither a Unionist nor a Separatist.&quot; By then, however, the Gaelic League was already being covertly infiltrated and politicised by operatives working for Thomas Clarke and the Irish Republican Brotherhood.

At the same time, however, the Catholic Church in Ireland also began to believe in the worth of the language and had begun to take steps to ensure its survival. Ironically, however, both the state and Church interference became something that Irish people began to resent.

Protestants and Unionists alike began to back away from the Gaelic revival as, besides the dominant role of the Roman Catholic Church by then, Irish people were starting to be described as a &quot;race&quot;. James Alexander Rentoul, MP for Down East, stated at Westminster in July 1900 that the Irish language had no value and should not receive any support by the public education system. He also stated that Irish-speaking children should continue being subjected to coercive Anglicization in the schools so that the Irish language would soon become extinct. Even so, in 1905 the Irish Unionist Party had an Irish slogan, which it proudly displayed at a convention.

The British civil service officials of the Intermediate Board, the organisation through which public education policy was implemented, attempted to frustrate the improvement of Irish-medium education provision so severely that the sitting Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, John Hamilton-Gordon, had to write to the Board on 25 July 1906 to demand that the provision be implemented. In response, John Lonsdale, MP for Mid Armagh and member of the Ulster Unionist Council, claimed that the Gaelic movement which supported the Irish language was simply inspired by Irish republicanism and hatred of all things English. He opposed any teaching of Irish in primary schools as &quot;money wasted&quot; and &quot;useless&quot; as well as claiming that Irish was a vehicle for the dissemination of &quot;seditious views.&quot;

===Since the partition of Ireland===
Following the partition of Ireland into the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland (which remained part of the United Kingdom), the largest Irish-speaking area in the former province of Ulster; County Donegal; had gone into the Irish Free State. However, there were Gaeltacht areas (communities who continued to speak Irish as their first language) in Northern Ireland at the time; the most prominent of these were the Sperrin Mountains in County Tyrone and County Londonderry, Rathlin Island and the Glens of Antrim in County Antrim, Aghyaran in County Tyrone, parts of south Armagh and Cashel in south-west County Fermanagh. Since 1921, the Irish language has been regarded with suspicion by many unionists in Northern Ireland, who have associated it with the Republic of Ireland and with Irish republicanism.

The Irish-language movement in Northern Ireland after 1921 responded to a lack of establishment support by pursuing a self-help social and recreational movement aimed at preserving Ulster Irish (an issue which had split the Belfast Gaelic League in 1911). By 1923, only one branch of the Gaelic League was left in operation in Northern Ireland, but from a handful of branches in 1926 the number of branches peaked at 182 in 1946. In contrast to the perception of the Irish Free State&#x27;s policy of preserving areas of Irish-speaking countryside, activists in Northern Ireland concentrated on ensuring Irish could survive in urban contexts, organising trips to Irish-speaking areas to bolster urban enthusiasm.

From the early years of the Northern Ireland government, education in Irish was marginalised. The number of primary schools teaching Irish was halved between 1924 and 1927, and numbers studying Irish as an extra subject fell from 5531 to 1290 between 1923 and 1926. The subsidy for Irish as an extra subject was abolished in 1934.

The last speakers of varieties of Irish native to what is now Northern Ireland died in the 20th century. Irish as spoken in Counties Down and Fermanagh were the first to die out, but native speakers of varieties spoken in the Glens of Antrim and the Sperrin Mountains of County Tyrone and County Londonderry survived into the 1950s and 1970s respectively, whilst the Armagh dialect survived until the 1930s or &#x27;40s. Varieties of Irish indigenous to the territory of Northern Ireland finally became extinct when the last native speaker of Rathlin Irish died in 1985. Séamus Bhriain Mac Amhlaigh, who died in 1983, was reportedly the last native-speaker of Antrim Irish. A wealth of recordings and stories told by Mac Amhlaigh, however, were recorded before his death by researchers from Queen&#x27;s University in Belfast.

At the same time, The Troubles exacerbated the politicisation of the Irish language in Northern Ireland. Many republicans in Northern Ireland, including former Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams, learned Irish while in prison. Furthermore, co-operative housing scheme in West Belfast aimed at creating an urban neo-Gaeltacht opened in 1969 in Shaw&#x27;s Road.

According to Innti poet and scholar of Modern literature in Irish Louis de Paor, this resulted in Belfast Irish, &quot;a new urban dialect&quot;, of Ulster Irish, that was &quot;forged in the heat of Belfast during The Troubles&quot; and which is now the main dialect spoken in the Gaeltacht Quarter.

To lend support for this effort during the early 1980s, Dublin-based Connaught Irish Modernist poet Máirtín Ó Direáin chose to risk both crossing what was still a &quot;hard border&quot; and the danger of falling victim to the ongoing paramilitary violence by Ulster Loyalists during The Troubles. Ó Direáin travelled to Northern Ireland and gave a poetry reading at the Cumann Chluain Ard, an urban language revival club in the Gaeltacht Quarter of West Belfast.

The Belfast Irish dialect, according to Louis de Paor, has even developed a &quot;street slang&quot;, which been used in the poetry of Gearóid Mac Lochlainn and other radically innovative writers of Modern literature in Irish like him. The very controversial and extremely popular hip hop music trio &quot;Kneecap&quot; is also based in the Gaeltacht Quarter and performs rap music in the West Belfast urban dialect of Ulster Irish.

Simultaneously, Linda Ervine and the &quot;Turas&quot; organisation based in East Belfast continues to seek, with considerable success, to promote the Irish language revival among Ulster Protestants.

==Status==
Most Irish speakers in Ulster today speak the Donegal dialect of Ulster Irish.

Irish received official recognition in Northern Ireland for the first time in 1998 under the Good Friday Agreement, and status as an official language in 2022. A cross-border body known as &quot;Foras na Gaeilge&quot; was established to promote the language in both Northern Ireland and the Republic, taking over the functions of &quot;Bord na Gaeilge&quot;.

The British government in 2001 ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Irish (in respect only of Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, thus giving it a degree of protection and status comparable to the Scottish Gaelic in Scotland. This included a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters (a lower level of recognition was accorded to the Ulster variety of Scots, under Part II of the Charter). Compliance with State obligations is assessed periodically by a Committee of Experts of the Council of Europe.

The &quot;Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998&quot; states: &quot;It shall be the duty of the Department (of Education) to encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium education.&quot;

A question about the Irish language was asked until the 1911 census of Ireland, but after partition was not included in the Northern Ireland census until it was reintroduced in 1991, at the 1911 census, the six counties which would become Northern Ireland had 28,734 Irish speakers. According to the 1991 Census, 142,003 people (9.45% of the population) had some language skills ability in Irish.

Note:

The &quot;ULTACH Trust&quot; (&quot;Iontaobhas ULTACH&quot;) was established in 1989 by Irish language enthusiasts to attract funding from the British Government for language projects and to broaden the appeal of the language on a cross-community basis (among both Protestants and Catholics)

The Shaw&#x27;s Road Gaeltacht was joined in 2002 by the Gaeltacht Quarter in west Belfast.

===Citizenship services===
The lack of provision for legal and citizenship services in the Irish language, including for the Life in the United Kingdom test, has been met with criticism from the &quot;Committee of Experts&quot; of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, of which the UK has ratified for the Cornish language, the Irish language, Manx Gaelic, the Scots &amp; Ulster Scots dialects, Scottish Gaelic and the Welsh language. In a 2014 report detailing the application of the charter in the UK, the committee were given no justification for the inequality in the treatment of Irish speakers in contrast to that of English, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh speakers, and that efforts to rectify the inequality were non-existent.

==Education==

Six families in Belfast established a Gaeltacht area in Belfast in the late 1960s and opened &quot;Bunscoil Phobal Feirste&quot; in 1970 as the first Irish-medium school in Northern Ireland, and in 1984 was granted the status of a voluntary maintained primary school. The first &quot;Naíscoil&quot; (Irish-medium nursery school) opened in 1978. Not long after the opening of Bunscoil Phobal Feirste, a second all-Irish primary school opened, &quot;Gaelscoil na bhFál,&quot; situated on the Falls Road. Founded by the parents of children that wanted Irish education but couldn&#x27;t find a space in &#x27;BPF&#x27;, one of the parents, named Sue Pentel, played a major role in the making of the school and about two years after the opening of Gaelscoil na bhFál, a daycare service, &quot;Ionad Uíbh Eachach,&quot; was opened and founded and managed by Sue Pentel. The school and daycare both provide services through the Irish language and work together in the way that many of the children that attended Ionad Uíbh Eachach then go on to attend nursery- Primary 7 (Naí ionad- R7) in Gaelscoil na bhFál. This is a very valuable connection that not that many schools have and what with the Ionad providing after-school care it is both convenient for the school and parents.

Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta (CnaG) is the representative body for Irish-medium Education. It was set up in 2000 by the Department of Education to promote, facilitate and encourage Irish-medium Education. One of CnaG&#x27;s central objectives is to seek to extend the availability of Irish-medium Education to parents who wish to avail of it for their children. Irish language pre-schools and primary schools are now thriving and there are official Irish language streams in secondary schools in Maghera, Donaghmore, Castlewellan and Armagh.

In December 2014 Minister for Education for Northern Ireland John O&#x27;Dowd announced that the Department of Education were going to set up Northern Ireland&#x27;s second &quot;gaelcholáiste&quot; in Dungiven Castle in County Londonderry. Gaelcholáiste Dhoire opened in September 2015.

In the academic year 2018/19, over 6,000 children are enrolled in Irish-medium education:
*43 nurseries (&quot;Naíscoileanna&quot;) with over 1,000 pupils
*35 primary schools (&quot;Bunscoileanna&quot;) with over 3,000 pupils
*2 second level gaelscoileanna (&quot;Gaelcholáiste&quot;) with over 800 pupils
*3 Irish language streams (&quot;Sruith Lán-Ghaeilge&quot;)

The British Council administers a scheme to recruit Irish language assistants for English-medium schools in Northern Ireland.

In 2013, there were 309 entries for A-Level examinations in Irish and 2,078 for GCSE.

==Media==

BBC Radio Ulster began broadcasting a nightly half-hour programme, called &quot;Blas&quot; (&#x27;taste&#x27;), in Irish in the early 1980s, and there is now an Irish-language programme on the station every day. BBC Northern Ireland broadcast its first television programme in Irish in the early 1990s, SRL (&#x27;etc.&#x27;). In March 2005, TG4 began broadcasting from the Divis transmitter near Belfast, as a result of agreement between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Office. Following Digital Switchover for terrestrial television transmissions in both parts of Ireland in 2012, TG4 is now carried on Freeview HD for viewers in Northern Ireland (channel 51) as well as to those households in Border areas that have spillover reception of the ROI Saorview platform (channel 104). TG4 also continues to be available on other TV delivery platforms across Northern Ireland: Sky (channel 163) and Virgin Cable customers in Belfast (channel 877).

RTÉ&#x27;s Irish-language radio station, RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta based in the Republic of Ireland is also available in many areas in Northern Ireland. Raidió Fáilte a community radio station based in West Belfast covers the Greater Belfast area and started broadcasting in 2006 and broadcasts 24 hours per day seven days per week. It broadcasts a selection of programmes; music, chat, news, current affairs, sports, arts, literature, environmental and community issues. It is also available worldwide on the internet at RaidióFáilte.com.

Residents of Northern Ireland have access to web based media in Irish such as online newspaper Tuairisc.ie or online lifestyle magazine Nós. An Irish-language daily newspaper called &quot;Lá Nua&quot; (&quot;new day&quot;) folded in 2008 due to lack of funding.

The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission administers an Irish Language Broadcast Fund (announced by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in April 2004) to foster and develop an independent Irish-language television production sector in Northern Ireland. The European Commission authorised public funding for the fund in June 2005 considering that &quot;since the aid aims to promote cultural products and the Irish Language, it can be authorised under EU Treaty rules that allow state aids for the promotion of culture&quot;.

==Political aspects==
The Irish language in Northern Ireland has long been associated with identity. Prior to the turn of the 20th century, the Irish language was embraced by both sides of the community, although in decline. But the partition of Ireland in 1921 was a turning point in attitudes towards the language. Nationalists in Northern Ireland who felt that they had been abandoned by their southern counterparts felt that the Irish language was a significant marker of identity they now needed as a minority group.

During The Troubles, the Irish language revival became increasingly politicised. Its survival is sometimes described as largely due to families in the nationalist Shaw&#x27;s Road neighborhood of west Belfast, who during the 1960s decided to make the area a neo-Gaeltacht (a new Irish speaking area outside the traditional Gaeltachtaí). The result was a neighborhood now known as the Gaeltacht Quarter, which has become a centre for Modern literature in Irish. The hip hop music trio &quot;Kneecap&quot; is also based in the Gaeltacht Quarter and performs rap music in the West Belfast urban dialect of Ulster Irish. 

A second wave of the Irish language revival movement in Northern Ireland during the 1970s occurred in another locale – the Maze Prison. For republican prisoners, learning the Irish language in prison (aka &#x27;Jailtacht&#x27;) became a way in which to set themselves apart vis-à-vis the British authorities. More broadly, this use of the Irish language inspired many nationalists in Northern Ireland to use the language as a form of cultural expression and resistance to British rule. In particular, the Irish language has been used extensively by the Irish Republican legitimist Sinn Féin political party, which has been accused by unionists of exploiting the Irish language revival for political gain.

The favouring of the Irish language by &quot;physical force republicans&quot; has therefore led to it receiving mixed responses from unionist communities and politicians. In many unionist communities, the Irish language is regarded as a foreign language or the language of terrorists and therefore – unlike Catholic communities – in Protestant communities its inclusion in school curriculum and public notices continues to be strongly opposed. On the other hand, some moderate nationalists have been reluctant to use Irish too due to the paramilitary connotations associated with the language revival. Issues around the use of the Irish language were intensified when a unionist MLA was accused of mocking Irish in the Northern Irish Assembly. In November 2014, in response to a question about minority language policy the DUP&#x27;s Gregory Campbell said &quot;Curry my yoghurt can coca coalyer&quot; in what was meant to sound like &quot;Thank you, speaker&quot; in Irish which he later claimed was in an attempt to make a point about the continued political use of the language by some Sinn Féin MLAs in post 1998 Good Friday Agreement.

In recent years, cross-community efforts have attempted to make the Irish language more appealing to both sides of the community. Many local councils now use Irish bilingually with English (sometimes with Ulster Scots too) on many of its services in an attempt to neutralise the language. Some former loyalist prisoners such as Robin Stewart have even taken up learning the Irish language in east Belfast in an attempt to reclaim Irish identity and challenge Republicans about their version of Irish history and what it means to be Irish. The former Red Hand Commando prisoner William Smith learnt the language whilst in jail. The motto of the Red Hand Commando was the Irish phrase &quot;Lámh Dearg Abú&quot; which translated means &#x27;Red Hand to Victory&#x27;. Linda Ervine, the sister-in-law of former Ulster Volunteer Force paramilitary and politician David Ervine, began learning the language and set up the Turas Irish-Language Project in the predominately Unionist East Belfast area for others to learn the language in 2011.

==In popular culture==
The 2024 biopic film &quot;Kneecap&quot;, in which the actual band members play themselves alongside more experienced actors including Michael Fassbender, Josie Walker, and Simone Kirby, is set in the Gaeltacht Quarter in 2019. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2024, the first motion picture in the Irish language to do so.

<text>A stick shaker is a mechanical device designed to rapidly and noisily vibrate the control yoke (the &quot;stick&quot;) of an aircraft, warning the flight crew that an imminent aerodynamic stall has been detected. It is typically present on the majority of large civil jet aircraft, as well as most large military planes.

The stick shaker comprises a key component of an aircraft&#x27;s stall protection system. Accidents, such as the 1963 BAC One-Eleven test crash, were attributable to aerodynamic stalls and motivated aviation regulatory bodies to establish requirements for certain aircraft to be outfitted with stall protection measures, such as the stick shaker and stick pusher, to reduce such occurrences. While the stick shaker has become relatively prevalent amongst airliners and large transport aircraft, such devices are not infallible and require flight crews to be appropriately trained on their functionality and how to respond to their activation. Several instances of aircraft entering stalls have occurred even with properly functioning stick shakers, largely due to pilots reacting improperly.

==History==
When many small aircraft approach the critical angle of attack that will result in an aerodynamic stall, the smooth flow of air over the wings is interrupted, causing turbulent airflow at the trailing edge of the wings. Depending on the aircraft size or design, that turbulent air, known as buffet, typically impacts the elevator at the rear end of the aircraft, and that in turn causes vibrations that are transmitted through control cables and can be felt by the pilot on the yoke as violent shaking. This natural shaking of the control yoke serves as an early warning to pilots that a stall is developing.

For very large aircraft, fly-by-wire aircraft and some aircraft with complex tail designs, there is no buffet effect on the control yoke, because the turbulent air does not reach the elevator, or because any movement in the elevator from buffet is not transmitted back to the control yoke. This deprives pilots of these aircraft of one of the important early warnings that they are about to enter a stall.

Boeing aircraft designers were the first to solve this problem by creating a mechanical device, which they named a stick shaker, that shakes the control yoke in a similar way to how a yoke is shaken naturally in smaller aircraft as the aircraft approaches its critical angle of attack.

Stick shakers were being developed as early as 1949.

During 1963, a BAC One-Eleven airliner was lost after having crashed during a stall test. The pilots pushed the T-tailed plane past the limits of stall recovery and entered a deep stall state, in which the disturbed air from the stalled wing had rendered the elevator ineffective, directly leading to a loss of control and crash. As a consequence of the crash, a combined stick shaker/pusher system was installed in all production BAC One-Eleven airliners. A wider consequence of the incident was the instatement of a new requirement related to the pilot&#x27;s ability to identify and overcome stall conditions; a design of transport category aircraft that fails to comply with the specifics of this requirement may be acceptable if the aircraft is equipped with a stick pusher.

Following the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 on 25 May 1979, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an airworthiness directive, which mandated the installation and operation of stick shakers on both sets of flight controls on most models of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, a trijet airliner. (Previously, only the captain&#x27;s controls were equipped with a stick shaker on the DC-10; in the case of Flight 191, this single stick shaker had been disabled by a partial electrical power failure early in the accident sequence.) In addition to regulatory pressure, various aircraft manufacturers have endeavoured to devise their own improved stall protection systems, many of which have included the stick shaker. The American aerospace company Boeing had designed and integrated stall warning systems into numerous aircraft that it has produced.

A wide range of aircraft have incorporated stick shakers into their cockpits. Textron Aviation&#x27;s Citation Longitude business jet is one such example, as is the Pilatus PC-24 light business jet, and Bombardier Aviation&#x27;s Challenger 600 family of business jets. Commercial airliners such as the newer models of the Boeing 737, the Boeing 767, and the Embraer E-Jet E2 family have also included stick shakers in the aircraft&#x27;s stall protection systems.

==Function in stall protection systems==
The stick shaker is a major element of an aircraft&#x27;s stall protection system. The system is composed of fuselage or wing-mounted angle of attack (AOA) sensors that are connected to an avionics computer, which receives inputs from the AOA sensors along with a variety of other flight systems. When this data indicates an imminent stall condition, the computer actuates both the stick shaker and an auditory alert. The shaker itself is composed of an electric motor connected to a deliberately unbalanced flywheel. When actuated, the shaker induces a forceful, noisy, and entirely unmistakable shaking of the control yoke. This shaking of the control yoke matches the frequency and amplitude of the stick shaking that occurs due to airflow separation in low-speed aircraft as they approach the stall. The stick shaking is intended to act as a backup to the auditory stall alert, in cases where the flight crew may be distracted.

===Stick pusher===
Other stall protection systems include the stick pusher, a device that automatically pushes forward on the control yoke, commanding a reduction in the aircraft&#x27;s angle of attack and thus preventing the aircraft from entering a full stall. In the majority of circumstances, the stick pusher will not activate until shortly after the stick shaker has given its warning of near-stall conditions being detected, and will not activate if the flight crew have performed appropriate actions to reduce the likelihood of stalling by lowering the angle of attack. Under most regulatory regimes, an aircraft&#x27;s stall protection systems must be tested and armed prior to takeoff, as well as remain armed throughout the flight; for this reason, startup checklists normally include performing such tests as a matter of routine.

==Audio==
The vibration of the stick shaker is loud enough that it can be commonly heard on cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recordings of aircraft that have encountered stall conditions. This level of vigorous movement is intentional, the stick shaker having been designed to be impossible to ignore. To unfamiliar flight crews, the stall warning system can be viewed as aggressive and impatient, hence why it has become commonplace for the system to be introduced to trainee pilots via a flight simulator rather than a live aircraft. To fly without them would increase the likelihood of the aircraft encountering, and improperly responding to, a stall event.

==Flight crew factor==
During the 2000s, there was a series of accidents that were attributed, at least in part, to their flight crews having made improper responses to the activation of the stall warning systems. During the early 2010s, in response to this wave of accidents, the FAA issued guidance urging operators to ensure that flight crews are properly training on the correct use of these aids.

<doc id="340294" wikidata="Q282649" url="?curid=340294" title="Pentagonal number theorem">
<text>In mathematics, Euler&#x27;s pentagonal number theorem relates the product and series representations of the Euler function. It states that

:formula_1

In other words,

:formula_2

The exponents 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, ... on the right hand side are given by the formula for &quot;k&quot; = 1, −1, 2, −2, 3, ... and are called (generalized) pentagonal numbers . (The constant term 1 corresponds to formula_3.)
This holds as an identity of convergent power series for formula_4, and also as an identity of formal power series.

A striking feature of this formula is the amount of cancellation in the expansion of the product.

== Relation with partitions ==

The identity implies a recurrence for calculating formula_5, the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot;:

:formula_6

or more formally,

:formula_7

where the summation is over all nonzero integers &quot;k&quot; (positive and negative) and formula_8 is the &quot;k&quot;th generalized pentagonal number. Since formula_9 for all formula_10, the apparently infinite series on the right has only finitely many non-zero terms, enabling an efficient calculation of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

==Franklin&#x27;s bijective proof==

The theorem can be interpreted combinatorially in terms of partitions. In particular, the left hand side is a generating function for the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot; into an even number of distinct parts minus the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot; into an odd number of distinct parts. Each partition of &quot;n&quot; into an even number of distinct parts contributes +1 to the coefficient of &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;; each partition into an odd number of distinct parts contributes −1. (The article on unrestricted partition functions discusses this type of generating function.)

For example, the coefficient of &quot;x&quot;5 is +1 because there are two ways to split 5 into an even number of distinct parts (4 + 1 and 3 + 2), but only one way to do so for an odd number of distinct parts (the one-part partition 5). However, the coefficient of &quot;x&quot;12 is −1 because there are seven ways to partition 12 into an even number of distinct parts, but there are eight ways to partition 12 into an odd number of distinct parts, and 7 − 8 = −1.

This interpretation leads to a proof of the identity by canceling pairs of matched terms (involution method). Consider the Ferrers diagram of any partition of &quot;n&quot; into distinct parts. For example, the diagram below shows &quot;n&quot; = 20 and the partition 20 = 7 + 6 + 4 + 3.

:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Let &quot;m&quot; be the number of elements in the smallest row of the diagram (&quot;m&quot; = 3 in the above example). Let &quot;s&quot; be the number of elements in the rightmost 45 degree line of the diagram (&quot;s&quot; = 2 dots in red above, since 7 − 1 = 6, but 6 − 1 &gt; 4). If &quot;m&quot; &gt; &quot;s&quot;, take the rightmost 45-degree line and move it to form a new row, as in the matching diagram below.

:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If m ≤ s (as in our newly formed diagram where &quot;m&quot; = 2, &quot;s&quot; = 5) we may reverse the process by moving the bottom row to form a new 45 degree line (adding 1 element to each of the first &quot;m&quot; rows), taking us back to the first diagram. 

A bit of thought shows that this process always changes the parity of the number of rows, and applying the process twice brings us back to the original diagram. This enables us to pair off Ferrers diagrams contributing 1 and −1 to the &quot;xn&quot; term of the series, resulting in a net coefficient of 0 for &quot;xn&quot;. This holds for every term &quot;except&quot; when the process cannot be performed on every Ferrers diagram with &quot;n&quot; dots. There are two such cases:

1) &quot;m&quot; = &quot;s&quot; and the rightmost diagonal and bottom row meet. For example,

:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Attempting to perform the operation would lead us to:

:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

which fails to change the parity of the number of rows, and is not reversible in the sense that performing the operation again does &quot;not&quot; take us back to the original diagram. If there are &quot;m&quot; elements in the last row of the original diagram, then

:formula_11

where the new index &quot;k&quot; is taken to equal &quot;m&quot;. Note that the sign associated with this partition is (−1)&quot;s&quot;, which by construction equals (−1)&quot;m&quot; and (−1)&quot;k&quot;.

2) &quot;m&quot; = &quot;s&quot; + 1 and the rightmost diagonal and bottom row meet. For example,

:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Our operation requires us to move the right diagonal to the bottom row, but that would lead to two rows of three elements, forbidden since we&#x27;re counting partitions into distinct parts. This is the previous case but with one fewer row, so

:formula_12

where we take &quot;k&quot; = 1−&quot;m&quot; (a negative integer). Here the associated sign is (−1)&quot;s&quot; with &quot;s&quot; = &quot;m&quot; − 1 = −&quot;k&quot;, therefore the sign is again (−1)&quot;k&quot;.

In summary, it has been shown that partitions into an even number of distinct parts and an odd number of distinct parts exactly cancel each other, producing null terms 0&quot;xn&quot;, except if &quot;n&quot; is a generalized pentagonal number formula_13, in which case there is exactly one Ferrers diagram left over, producing a term (−1)&quot;k&quot;&quot;xn&quot;. But this is precisely what the right side of the identity says should happen, so we are finished.

==Partition recurrence==

We can rephrase the above proof, using integer partitions, which we denote as:
formula_14, 
where formula_15.
The number of partitions of &quot;n&quot; is the partition function &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) having generating function:

:formula_16

Note that is the reciprocal of the product on the left hand side of our identity:

:formula_17

Let us denote the expansion of our product by
formula_18
so that

:formula_19

Multiplying out the left hand side and equating coefficients on the two sides, we obtain 
&quot;a&quot;0 &quot;p&quot;(0) = 1 and formula_20 for all formula_21. This gives a recurrence relation defining &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) in terms of &quot;an&quot;, and vice versa a recurrence for &quot;an&quot; in terms of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). Thus, our desired result:

:formula_22

for formula_23 is equivalent to the identity formula_24 where formula_25 and &quot;i&quot; ranges over all integers such that formula_26 (this range includes both positive and negative i, so as to use both kinds of generalized pentagonal numbers). This in turn means:

:formula_27

In terms of sets of partitions, this is equivalent to saying that the following sets are of equal cardinality: 

:formula_28         and         formula_29

where formula_30 denotes the set of all partitions of formula_31.
All that remains is to give a bijection from one set to the other, which is accomplished by the function &quot;φ&quot; from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; which maps the partition formula_32 to the partition formula_33 defined by:

:formula_34

This is an involution (a self-inverse mapping), and thus in particular a bijection, which proves our claim and the identity.
==See also==
The pentagonal number theorem occurs as a special case of the Jacobi triple product.
Q-series generalize Euler&#x27;s function, which is closely related to the Dedekind eta function, and occurs in the study of modular forms. The modulus of the Euler function (see there for picture) shows the fractal modular group symmetry and occurs in the study of the interior of the Mandelbrot set.

<doc id="340295" wikidata="Q422884" url="?curid=340295" title="Ethyl carbamate">
<text>Ethyl carbamate (also called urethane) is an organic compound with the formula CH3CH2OC(O)NH2. It is an ester of carbamic acid and a white solid. Despite its name, it is not a component of polyurethanes. Because it is a carcinogen, it is rarely used, but naturally forms in low quantities in many types of fermented foods and drinks.

==Synthesis==
It is produced by organically heating urea and ethyl alcohol. It also arises by the action of ammonia on ethyl chloroformate.

==Uses==
===Biomedical applications===
Ethyl carbamate has been used as an antineoplastic agent and for other medicinal purposes, but this application ended after it was discovered to be carcinogenic in 1943. However, Japanese usage in medical injections continued and from 1950 to 1975 an estimated 100 million 2 ml ampules of 7-to-15% solutions of ethyl carbamate were injected into patients as a co-solvent in water for dissolving water-insoluble analgesics used for post-operation pain. These doses were estimated to be at levels that are carcinogenic in mice. This practice was stopped in 1975. &quot;This regrettable medical situation appears to have involved the largest number (millions) of humans exposed to the largest doses of a pure carcinogen that is on record&quot;. The author, U.S. cancer researcher James A. Miller, called for studies to determine the effects on Japanese cancer rates to be performed but apparently none were ever done.

Prior to World War II, ethyl carbamate saw relatively heavy use in the treatment of multiple myeloma before it was found to be toxic, carcinogenic, and largely ineffective. By US FDA regulations, ethyl carbamate has been withdrawn from pharmaceutical use. However, small quantities of ethyl carbamate are also used in laboratories as an anesthetic for animals.

Ethyl carbamate was reclassified as a Group 2A carcinogen by IARC in 2007.

Ethyl carbamate is used as an anaesthetic in animal experiments, with more than 100 animal studies using ethyl carbamate published each year. One advantage of using ethyl carbamate is that it has a very long duration of action, with some adult rats remaining anaesthetised 24 hours after administration of the drug. It also does not depress neuronal activity in the cortex to the same extent as isoflurane.

===Other uses===
Formerly, ethyl carbamate was used as a chemical intermediate in the preparation of amino resins, that were in turn used as crosslinking agents for permanent-press textile treatments to create &quot;wash-and-wear&quot; fabrics. Other uses included as solvent or intermediary in the manufacture of pesticides, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

==Occurrence in beverages and food==
The widespread presence of ethyl carbamate in alcoholic beverages was discovered during the mid-1980s. To raise public awareness of this issue, the U.S. Center for Science in the Public Interest published, in 1987, &quot;Tainted Booze: The Consumer&#x27;s Guide to Urethane in Alcoholic Beverages&quot;. Studies have shown that most, if not all, yeast-fermented alcoholic beverages contain traces of ethyl carbamate (15 ppb to 12 ppm). Other foods and beverages prepared by means of fermentation also contain ethyl carbamate. For example, bread has been found to contain 2 ppb; as much as 20 ppb has been found in some samples of soy sauce. Amounts of both ethyl carbamate and methyl carbamate have also been found in wines, sake, beer, brandy, whiskey and other fermented alcoholic beverages.

It has been shown that ethyl carbamate forms from the reaction of ethanol with urea:
This reaction occurs much faster at higher temperatures, and therefore higher concentrations of ethyl carbamate are found in beverages that are heated during processing, such as brandy, whiskey, and other distilled beverages. Additionally, heating after bottling either during shipping or in preparation will cause ethyl carbamate levels to rise further.

The urea in wines results from the metabolism of arginine or citrulline by yeast or other organisms. The urea waste product is initially metabolised inside the yeast cell until it builds up to a certain level. At that point, it is excreted externally where it is able to react with the alcohol to create ethyl carbamate.

In 1988, wine and other alcoholic beverage manufacturers in the United States agreed to control the level of ethyl carbamate in wine to less than 15 ppb (parts per billion), and in stronger alcoholic drinks to less than 125 ppb.

Although the urea cannot be eliminated, it can be minimized by controlling the fertilization of grape vines, minimizing their heat exposure, using self-cloning yeast and other actions. Furthermore, some strains of yeast have been developed to help reduce ethyl carbamate during commercial production of alcoholic beverages.

Another important mechanism for ethyl carbamate formation in alcoholic beverages is the reaction from cyanide as precursor, which causes comparably high levels in spirits derived from cyanogenic plants, such as rhum agricole.

==Hazards==
Ethyl carbamate is not acutely toxic to humans, as reflected by its use as a medicine. Acute toxicity studies show that the lowest fatal dose in rats, mice, and rabbits equals 1.2 g/kg or more. When ethyl carbamate was used medicinally, about 50% of the patients exhibited nausea and vomiting, and long-time use led to gastroenteric hemorrhages. The compound has almost no odor and a cooling, saline, bitter taste.

Studies with rats, mice, and hamsters have shown that ethyl carbamate causes cancer when administered orally, injected, or applied to the skin, but no adequate studies of cancer in humans caused by ethyl carbamate has been reported due to the ethical considerations of such studies. However, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer raised ethyl carbamate to a Group 2A carcinogen that is &quot;probably carcinogenic to humans&quot;, one level below fully carcinogenic to humans. IARC has stated that ethyl carbamate can be &quot;reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals&quot;. In 2006, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario in Canada rejected imported cases of sherry due to excessive levels of ethyl carbamate.

Studies in Hong Kong (2009) and Korea (2015) outline the extent of the accumulative exposure to ethyl carbamate in daily life. Fermented foods such as soy sauce, kimchi, soybean paste, breads, rolls, buns, crackers and bean curd, along with wine, sake and plum wine, were found to be the foods with the highest ethyl carbamate levels in traditional Asian diets.

In 2005, the JECFA (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee On Food Additives) risk-assessment evaluation of ethyl carbamate concluded that the MOE intake of ethyl carbamate from daily food and alcoholic beverages combined is of concern, and mitigation measures to reduce ethyl carbamate in some alcoholic beverages should continue. There is little doubt that ethyl carbamate in alcoholic beverages is very important to health authorities, while the cumulative daily exposure in the typical diet is also an issue of rising concern that merits closer observation. The Korean study concluded: &quot;It would be desirable to closely monitor ethyl carbamate levels in Korean foods and find ways to reduce the daily intake.&quot;

The IARC evaluation has led to the following US regulatory actions:
* NESHAP: Listed as a Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP)
* Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act: Reportable Quantity (RQ) = 100 lb
* Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, EPA&#x27;s Toxics Release Inventory: A listed substance subject to RCRA reporting requirements
* RCRA Listed Hazardous Waste: substance - U238

==Detection in alcoholic beverages==
The concerns raised by the toxicological aspects of EC together with the low concentration levels (μg/L) found in wines, as well as the occurrence of interferences on detection, has motivated several researchers to develop new methods to determine it in wines. Several extraction and chromatographic techniques have been used, including continuous liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) with Soxhlet apparatus, derivatization with 9-xanthydrol followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection and even LLE after derivatization, followed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection (GC–MS). On the other hand, the reference method set by the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) uses solid phase extraction (SPE) preceding GC–MS quantification. Other methods also make use of SPE, but use gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (MDGC/MS) and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) for detection. Most of the methodologies found in the literature to quantify EC use gas chromatography, using LLE and SPE as extraction techniques. Nevertheless, several efforts have also been done to develop new methodologies to determine EC without using long procedures and hard-working analyses, combining precision to high sensitivity. In this regard, headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) has been gaining great highlighting and alternative methodologies has been proposed using the most recent identification and quantification technology, such as gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (GC–MS/MS) and two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC–ToFMS).

Microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) is also feasible. MEPS/GC–MS methodology has been applied to quantify EC in wines.

Miniaturized liquid-liquid extraction (mLLE) followed by LC-MS/MS can be used to determine EC in wine, without using derivatizing agents.

==Related compounds==
Other carbamates include methyl carbamate, butyl carbamate, and phenyl carbamate (m. p. 149–152 °C), which can also be prepared from the corresponding chloroformate and ammonia. These esters are white, crystalline solids at room temperature. Except for the phenyl carbamate, they sublime at moderate temperatures; methyl carbamate sublimes at room temperatures. The first two and ethyl carbamate are very soluble in water, benzene, and ether. These other carbamates (methyl, butyl, and phenyl) are only used in small quantities for research purposes.

<text>In aviation, slow flight is the region of flight below the maximum lift to drag ratio, where induced drag becomes more significant than parasitic drag. Slow flight can be as slow as 3-5 knots above stall airspeed.

Slow flight is sometimes referred to as the “region of reversed command” or the “back side of the power curve”. This is because in slow flight, more power is required to maintain straight and level flight at lower airspeeds. A very high angle of attack is required to maintain altitude in slow flight.

At these low airspeeds, flight control surfaces begin to lose their effectiveness due to the reduction in airflow over them. Ailerons are the most affected, and roll control is significantly degraded. If ailerons are used in slow flight, there is a possibility that the high wing will stall due to the increased angle of attack, sending the aircraft into a spin. In many modern aircraft, flight envelope protection in the aircraft flight control system prevents this from happening. The rudder remains effective in slow flight, and yaw provided by it can be used to control the bank angle and direction of the aircraft.

<text>A totem (from or &quot;doodem&quot;) is a spirit being, sacred object, or symbol that serves as an emblem of a group of people, such as a family, clan, lineage, or tribe, such as in the Anishinaabe clan system.

While the word &quot;totem&quot; itself is an anglicisation of the Ojibwe term (and both the word and beliefs associated with it are part of the Ojibwe language and culture), belief in tutelary spirits and deities is not limited to the Ojibwe people. Similar concepts, under differing names and with variations in beliefs and practices, may be found in a number of cultures worldwide. The term has also been adopted, and at times redefined, by anthropologists and philosophers of different cultures.

Contemporary neoshamanic, New Age, and mythopoetic men&#x27;s movements not otherwise involved in the practice of a traditional, tribal religion have been known to use &quot;totem&quot; terminology for the personal identification with a tutelary spirit or spirit guide.

==Ojibwe &quot;doodemen&quot;==

The Anishinaabe peoples are divided into a number of (in syllabics: or ), or clans, (singular: ) named mainly for animal totems (or , as an Ojibwe person would say this word). In Anishinaabemowin, means heart. or clan literally would translate as &#x27;the expression of, or having to do with one&#x27;s heart&#x27;, with referring to the extended family. In the Anishinaabe oral tradition, in prehistory the Anishinaabe were living along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean when the great beings appeared from the sea. These beings taught the Mide way of life to the &quot;Waabanakiing&quot; peoples. Six of the seven great beings that remained to teach established the for the peoples in the east. The five original Anishinaabe totems were (bullhead), (echo-maker, i.e., crane), (pintail duck), (tender, i.e., bear) and (&quot;little&quot; moose-tail).

==Totem poles==
The totem poles of the Pacific Northwestern Indigenous peoples of North America are carved, monumental poles featuring many different designs (bears, birds, frogs, people, and various supernatural beings and aquatic creatures). They serve multiple purposes in the communities that make them. Similar to other forms of heraldry, they may function as crests of families or chiefs, recount stories owned by those families or chiefs, or commemorate special occasions. These stories are known to be read from the bottom of the pole to the top.

==Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders==
The spiritual, mutual relationships between Aboriginal Australians, Torres Strait Islanders, and the natural world are often described as totems. Many Indigenous groups object to using the imported Ojibwe term &quot;totem&quot; to describe a pre-existing and independent practice, although others use the term. The term &quot;token&quot; has replaced &quot;totem&quot; in some areas.

In some cases, such as the Yuin of coastal New South Wales, a person may have multiple totems of different types (personal, family or clan, gender, tribal and ceremonial). The or clans of the Ngarrindjeri were each associated with one or two plant or animal totems, called . Totems are sometimes attached to moiety relations (such as in the case of Wangarr relationships for the Yolngu).

Torres Strait Islanders have &quot;auguds,&quot; typically translated as totems. An &quot;augud&quot; could be a &quot;kai augud&quot; (&quot;chief totem&quot;) or &quot;mugina augud&quot; (&quot;little totem&quot;).

Early anthropologists sometimes attributed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander totemism to ignorance about procreation, with the entrance of an ancestral spirit individual (the &quot;totem&quot;) into the woman believed to be the cause of pregnancy (rather than insemination). James George Frazer in &quot;Totemism and Exogamy&quot; wrote that Aboriginal people &quot;have no idea of procreation as being directly associated with sexual intercourse, and firmly believe that children can be born without this taking place&quot;. Frazer&#x27;s thesis has been criticised by other anthropologists, including Alfred Radcliffe-Brown in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1938.

==Anthropological perspectives==

Early anthropologists and ethnologists like James George Frazer, Alfred Cort Haddon, John Ferguson McLennan and W. H. R. Rivers identified totemism as a shared practice across indigenous groups in unconnected parts of the world, typically reflecting a stage of human development.

Scottish ethnologist John Ferguson McLennan, following the vogue of 19th-century research, addressed totemism in a broad perspective in his study &quot;The Worship of Animals and Plants&quot; (1869, 1870). McLennan did not seek to explain the specific origin of the totemistic phenomenon but sought to indicate that all of the human race had, in ancient times, gone through a totemistic stage.

Another Scottish scholar, Andrew Lang, early in the 20th century, advocated a nominalistic explanation of totemism, namely, that local groups or clans, in selecting a totemistic name from the realm of nature, were reacting to a need to be differentiated. If the origin of the name was forgotten, Lang argued, there followed a mystical relationship between the object—from which the name was once derived—and the groups that bore these names. Through nature myths, animals and natural objects were considered as the relatives, patrons, or ancestors of the respective social units.

British anthropologist Sir James George Frazer published &quot;Totemism and Exogamy&quot; in 1910, a four-volume work based largely on his research among Indigenous Australians and Melanesians, along with a compilation of the work of other writers in the field.

By 1910, the idea of totemism as having common properties across cultures was being challenged, with Russian American ethnologist Alexander Goldenweiser subjecting totemistic phenomena to sharp criticism. Goldenweiser compared Indigenous Australians and First Nations in British Columbia to show that the supposedly shared qualities of totemism—exogamy, naming, descent from the totem, taboo, ceremony, reincarnation, guardian spirits and secret societies and art—were actually expressed very differently between Australia and British Columbia, and between different peoples in Australia and between different peoples in British Columbia. He then expands his analysis to other groups to show that they share some of the customs associated with totemism, without having totems. He concludes by offering two general definitions of totemism, one of which is: &quot;Totemism is the tendency of definite social units to become associated with objects and symbols of emotional value&quot;.

The founder of a French school of sociology, Émile Durkheim, examined totemism from a sociological and theological point of view, attempting to discover a pure religion in very ancient forms and claimed to see the origin of religion in totemism. In addition, he argued that totemism also served as a form of collective worship, reinforcing social cohesion and solidarity.

The leading representative of British social anthropology, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, took a totally different view of totemism. Like Franz Boas, he was skeptical that totemism could be described in any unified way. In this he opposed the other pioneer of social anthropology in England, Bronisław Malinowski, who wanted to confirm the unity of totemism in some way and approached the matter more from a biological and psychological point of view than from an ethnological one. According to Malinowski, totemism was not a cultural phenomenon, but rather the result of trying to satisfy basic human needs within the natural world. As far as Radcliffe-Brown was concerned, totemism was composed of elements that were taken from different areas and institutions, and what they have in common is a general tendency to characterize segments of the community through a connection with a portion of nature. In opposition to Durkheim&#x27;s theory of sacralization, Radcliffe-Brown took the point of view that nature is introduced into the social order rather than secondary to it. At first, he shared with Malinowski the opinion that an animal becomes totemistic when it is “good to eat.” He later came to oppose the usefulness of this viewpoint, since many totems—such as crocodiles and flies—are dangerous and unpleasant.

In 1938, the structural functionalist anthropologist A. P. Elkin wrote &quot;The Australian Aborigines: How to understand them.&quot; His typologies of totemism included eight &quot;forms&quot; and six &quot;functions&quot;.

The forms identified were:

* individual (a personal totem), 
* sex (one totem for each gender), 
* moiety (the &quot;tribe&quot; consists of two groups, each with a totem), 
* section (the &quot;tribe&quot; consists of four groups, each with a totem), 
* subsection (the &quot;tribe&quot; consists of eight groups, each with a totem),
* clan (a group with common descent share a totem or totems), 
* local (people living or born in a particular area share a totem) and 
* &quot;multiple&quot; (people across groups share a totem).

The functions identified were:

* social (totems regulate marriage, and often a person cannot eat the flesh of their totem), 
* cult (totems associated with a secret organization),
* conception (multiple meanings), 
* dream (the person appears as this totem in others&#x27; dreams),
* classificatory (the totem sorts people) and 
* assistant (the totem assists a healer or clever person).

The terms in Elkin&#x27;s typologies see some use today, but Aboriginal customs are seen as more diverse than his typologies suggest.

As a chief representative of modern structuralism, French ethnologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, and his (&quot;Totemism Today&quot; [1958]) are often cited in the field.

In the 21st century, Australian anthropologists question the extent to which &quot;totemism&quot; can be generalized even across different Aboriginal Australian peoples, let alone to other cultures like the Ojibwe from whom the term was originally derived. Rose, James and Watson write that:

==Literature==
Poets, and to a lesser extent fiction writers, often use anthropological concepts, including the anthropological understanding of totemism. For this reason, literary criticism often resorts to psychoanalytic, anthropological analyses.

<text>Ferdinand August Bebel (; 22 February 1840 – 13 August 1913) was a German socialist activist and politician. He was one of the principal founders of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDP).

Bebel, a woodworker by trade, co-founded the Saxon People&#x27;s Party with Wilhelm Liebknecht in 1866. In 1869, the two founded the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP), and in 1875 they helped bring the SDAP and Ferdinand Lassalle&#x27;s General German Workers&#x27; Association (ADAV) together to form the party which became the SPD. Bebel played a key role in the drafting and adoption of the party&#x27;s Marxist Erfurt Program in 1891. He was also a member of the Reichstag from 1871 until his death, and was involved in the founding of the Second International in 1889. He served as chairman of the SPD from 1892 to 1913.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Ferdinand August Bebel, known as August, was born on 22 February 1840, in Deutz, Germany, now a part of Cologne. He was the son of a Prussian noncommissioned officer in the Prussian infantry, initially from Ostrowo in the Province of Posen, and was born in military barracks. The father died in 1844.

As a young man, Bebel apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner in Leipzig. Like most German workmen at that time, he travelled extensively in search of work and he thereby obtained a first-hand knowledge of the difficulties facing the working people of the day.

At Salzburg, where he lived for some time, he joined a Roman Catholic workmen&#x27;s club. When in Tyrol in 1859 he volunteered for service in the war against Italy, but was rejected; and in his own country he was rejected likewise as physically unfit for the army.

In 1860 he settled in Leipzig as a master turner, making horn buttons. He joined various labour organisations. Although initially an opponent of socialism, Bebel gradually was won over to socialist ideas through pamphlets of Ferdinand Lassalle, which popularized the ideas of Karl Marx. In 1865 he came under the influence of Wilhelm Liebknecht and was thereafter committed fully to the socialist cause. In 1866 he joined the First International.

===Political career===
Following the death of Lassalle, Bebel was among the group of Socialists that refused to follow new party leader Johann Baptist von Schweitzer at the Eisenach Conference of 1867, an action which gave rise to the name &quot;Eisenachers&quot; for this Marxist faction. Together with Liebknecht, he founded the &quot;Sächsische Volkspartei&quot; (&quot;Saxon People&#x27;s Party&quot;). Bebel was also President of the Union of German Workers&#x27; Associations from 1867 and a member of the First International.

Bebel was elected to the North German Reichstag as a member from Saxony in that same year.

In 1869 he helped found the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Germany (SDAP), which later merged with another organisation in 1875 to form the (SAPD), which in turn became the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1890.

Bebel&#x27;s great organizing talent and oratorical power quickly made him one of the leaders of the socialists and their chief spokesman in parliament. He remained a member of the North German Parliament, and later of its counterpart for the German Empire, the Reichstag, until his death, except for the interval of 1881–83. He represented successively the districts of Glauchau, Meerane, Dresden, Strassburg, and Hamburg. Later in his life, he acted as chairman of the SPD. Representing as he did Marxian principles, he was bitterly opposed by certain factions of his party.

In 1870 he spoke in parliament against the continuance of the war with France. Bebel and Liebknecht were the only members who did not vote the extraordinary subsidy required for the war with France. Bebel was one of only two socialists elected to the Reichstag in 1871, and he used his position to protest against the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine and to express his full sympathy with the Paris Commune. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck afterwards said that this speech of Bebel&#x27;s was a &quot;ray of light&quot; showing him that socialism was an enemy to be fought against and crushed. Falsely accused of being in league with the French and part of a conspiracy to free French prisoners of war held in Germany and to lead them in an attack from the rear, Bebel and Liebknecht were arrested for high treason, but no prosecution was possible for lack of evidence.

Not wanting to release such important opponents of the war effort, old charges of preaching dangerous doctrines and plotting against the state were levied against Bebel and Liebknecht in 1872. The pair were convicted and sentenced to two years in &quot;&quot; (imprisonment in a fortress), which was spent at the famous Königstein Fortress. For insulting the German emperor, Bebel was additionally sentenced to nine months&#x27; ordinary imprisonment. This incarceration served to increase Bebel&#x27;s prestige among his party associates and the sympathetic public at large.

In 1874 Bebel took a partner and founded a small button factory, for which he acted as salesman, but in 1889 he gave up his business to devote himself wholly to politics. In 1868 he became connected with the staff of the &quot;Volksstaat&quot; (&quot;The People&#x27;s State&quot;) at Leipzig, and in 1891 with that of the &quot;Vorwärts&quot; (&quot;Forward&quot;) at Berlin.

After his release from prison, he helped to organise, at the congress of Gotha, the united party of Social Democrats, which had been formed during his imprisonment. After the passing of the Socialist Law he continued to show great activity in the debates of the Reichstag, and was also elected a member of the Saxon parliament; when the state of siege was proclaimed in Leipzig he was expelled from the city, and in 1886 condemned to nine months&#x27; imprisonment for taking part in a secret society.

In party meetings of 1890 and 1891, Bebel&#x27;s policies were severely attacked, first by the extremists, the &quot;young&quot; Socialists from Berlin, who wished to abandon parliamentary action; against these Bebel won a complete victory. On the other side he was involved in a quarrel with Volmar and his school, who desired to put aside from immediate consideration the complete attainment of the socialist ideal, and proposed that the party should aim at bringing about, not a complete overthrow of society, but a gradual amelioration. This conflict of tendencies continued, and Bebel came to be regarded as the chief exponent of the traditional views of the orthodox Marxist party. Though a strong opponent of militarism, he publicly stated that foreign nations attacking Germany must not expect the help or the neutrality of the Social Democrats. Already in 1911 amid the rising tensions between the European powers, Bebel publicly predicted an upcoming great war with millions of soldiers confronting each other followed by a great collapse, &quot;mass bankruptcy, mass misery, mass unemployment and great famine&quot;.

In 1899, at the Hanover Congress of the SPD, Bebel delivered a speech condemning Eduard Bernstein&#x27;s revisionism. His resolution, &quot;Attacks on the Fundamental Views and Tactics of the Party&quot;, garnered the support of the vast majority of the Congress, including Bernstein&#x27;s supporters.

===Class, race, religion and sex===
Bebel particularly distinguished himself by his denunciation of the maltreatment of soldiers by officers and still more frequently by non-commissioned officers. His efforts in this matter had received great encouragement when Albert, King of Saxony issued an edict dealing with the maltreatment of soldiers in the Saxon contingent, thus cutting the ground from under the feet of the Imperial Government, which had persistently attempted to deny or to explain away the cases put forward by Bebel.

Speaking before the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, Bebel criticised the war to crush the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900, saying:

Bebel is also famed for his outrage at the news of German mistreatment of indigenous people in German South-West Africa, the Herero nation in particular. In 1904 following a violent uprising by the Herero people against German officials, soldiers, and settlers, Imperial German Army General Lothar von Trotha launched the Herero and Namaqua Genocide to crush the revolt by waging a &quot;war of extermination&quot; against the Herero. In response, Bebel and the German Social Democratic Party became the only party in the Reichstag to oppose increased colonial expenditures, and in a speech in March 1904 Bebel classified the policy in German South-West Africa as &quot;not only barbaric, but bestial&quot;. This caused some sections of the contemporary German press to scathingly classify Bebel as &quot;Der hereroische Bebel&quot; (Bebel the Hereroic&quot;) (&quot;Coburger Zeitung&quot;, 17 January 1904). Bebel was not deterred; he later followed this up with strongly worded warnings against the rising tide of theories of racial hierarchy and racial purity, causing the 1907 general election to the Reichstag in 1907 to go down in history as the &quot;Hottentot Election&quot;.

Bebel&#x27;s book, &quot;Women and Socialism&quot; was translated into English by Daniel De Leon of the Socialist Labor Party of America as &quot;Woman under Socialism&quot;. It figured prominently in the Connolly-DeLeon controversy after James Connolly, then a member of the SLP, denounced it as a &quot;quasi-prurient&quot; book that would repel potential recruits to the socialist movement. The book contained an attack on the institution of marriage which identified Bebel with the most extreme forms of socialism. In the preface to DeLeon&#x27;s translation, &quot;Woman Under Socialism&quot;, DeLeon distanced himself from Bebel on this point, holding that monogamy was the most desirable form of social organisation.

In 1898 he voiced his support for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the Reichstag.

Bebel said that religion is a &quot;private matter&quot;, claiming that the SPD should be neutral on the question of religion, while in actuality advocating secularism. Bebel considered himself both a patriot and an internationalist believing them to not be antagonistic but instead supplemental.

===Death and legacy===

August Bebel died on 13 August 1913 of a heart attack during a visit to a sanatorium in Passugg, Switzerland. He was 73 years old at the time of his death. His body was buried in Zürich.

At the time of his death Bebel was eulogized by Russian Marxist leader Vladimir Lenin as a &quot;model workers&#x27; leader&quot;, who had proven himself able to &quot;break his own road&quot; from being an ordinary worker into becoming a political leader in the struggle for a &quot;better social system&quot;.

The well-known saying &quot;Anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools&quot; (&quot;Der Antisemitismus ist der Sozialismus der dummen Kerle&quot;) is frequently attributed to Bebel, but probably originated with the Austrian democrat Ferdinand Kronawetter; it was in general use among German Social Democrats by the 1890s.

Along with Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Ferdinand Lassalle, Bebel was among the socialist icons included in &quot;bas relief&quot; portraits on the facade of The Forward building, erected in 1912 as the headquarters of the New York Yiddish-language socialist newspaper.

Bebel&#x27;s legacy was adopted by the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), which named a square and several streets after him. Stamps bearing his likeness were also issued.

<text>Blancs d&#x27;Espagne (&quot;Spanish Whites&quot;) was a term used to refer to those legitimists in France who, following the death of the Comte de Chambord in 1883, supported the Spanish Carlist claimant rather than the Orleanist candidate, who was supported by the vast majority of French royalists.

The term was generally used by supporters of the Comte de Paris, the Orleanist candidate, as a term of derision for their ultra-legitimist opponents who so hated the House of Orléans that they would support a foreign prince over an Orleanist candidate. It is a pun on the cosmetic and cleanser known as &quot;blanc d&#x27;Espagne&quot;, originally a white lead pigment and later either basic bismuth nitrate or a preparation made from chalk and clay.

<text>Ludwig Immanuel Magnus (March 15, 1790 – September 25, 1861) was a German Jewish mathematician who, in 1831, published a paper about the inversion transformation, which leads to inversive geometry.

His reputation as a mathematician was established by 1834 and an honorary doctorate was conferred on him by the University of Bonn. His work appeared in Gergonne&#x27;s &quot;Annales de mathématiques pures et appliquées&quot; vols. xi and xvi (1820–25); in &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot;, vols. v, vii, viii, and ix (1830–32); in the third part (1833) of Meier Hirsch&#x27;s &quot;Sammlung Geometrischer Aufgaben&quot;; and in &quot;Sammlung von Aufgaben und Lehrsätzen aus der Analytischen Geometrie des Raumes&quot; (published in 1837, written earlier).

He studied Euclid while working in his uncle&#x27;s bank. From 1813 to 1815 he served as a gunner in the Napoleonic Wars. After the war he returned to banking and taught mathematics until 1834, when the founder of the academy at which he was teaching died. He then left teaching and spent nine years as the head revenue officer for the Berliner Kassenverein, retiring in 1843.

<text>Hans Bellmer (13 March 1902 – 24 February 1975) was a German artist, best known for his drawings, etchings that illustrates the 1940 edition of &quot;Histoire de l’œil&quot;, and the life-sized female dolls he produced in the mid-1930s. Historians of art and photography also consider him a Surrealist photographer.

==Biography==
Bellmer was born in the city of Kattowitz, then part of the German Empire (now Katowice, Poland). Up until 1926, he worked as a draftsman for his own advertising company.
Bellmer is most famous for the creation of a series of dolls as well as photographs of them. He was influenced in his choice of art form in part by reading the published letters of Oskar Kokoschka (&quot;Der Fetisch&quot;, 1925). Bellmer&#x27;s doll project is also said to have been catalysed by a series of events in his personal life. Hans Bellmer takes credit for provoking a physical crisis in his father and brings his own artistic creativity into association with childhood insubordination and resentment toward a severe and humorless paternal authority. Perhaps this is one reason for the nearly universal, unquestioning acceptance in the literature of Bellmer&#x27;s promotion of his art as a struggle against his father, the police, and ultimately, fascism and the state. Events of his personal life also including meeting a beautiful teenage cousin in 1932 (and perhaps other unattainable beauties), attending a performance of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s Tales of Hoffmann (in which a man falls tragically in love with an automaton), and receiving a box of his old toys. After these events, he began to actually construct his first dolls. In his works, Bellmer explicitly sexualized the doll as a young girl. The dolls incorporated the principle of &quot;ball joint&quot;, which was inspired by a pair of sixteenth-century articulated wooden dolls in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum Jonathan Hirschfeld has claimed (without further argumentation) that Bellmer initiated his doll project to oppose the fascism of the Nazi Party by declaring that he would make no work that would support the new German state. Represented by mutated forms and unconventional poses, his dolls (according to this view) were directed specifically at the cult of the perfect body then prominent in Germany.

He visited Paris in 1935 and made contacts there, such as Paul Éluard, but returned to Berlin because his wife Margarete was dying of tuberculosis.

Bellmer produced the first doll in Berlin in 1933. Long since lost, the assemblage can nevertheless be correctly described thanks to approximately two dozen photographs Bellmer took at the time of its construction. Standing about fifty-six inches tall, the doll consisted of a modeled torso made of flax fiber, glue, and plaster; a mask-like head of the same material with glass eyes and a long, unkempt wig; and a pair of legs made from broomsticks or dowel rods. One of these legs terminated in a wooden, club-like foot; the other was encased in a more naturalistic plaster shell, jointed at the knee and ankle. As the project progressed, Bellmer made a second set of hollow plaster legs, with wooden ball joints for the doll&#x27;s hips and knees. There were no arms to the first sculpture, but Bellmer did fashion or find a single wooden hand, which appears among the assortment of doll parts the artist documented in an untitled photograph of 1934, as well as in several photographs of later work.

Bellmer&#x27;s 1934 anonymous book, &quot;The Doll&quot; (&quot;Die Puppe&quot;), produced and published privately in Germany, contains 10 black-and-white photographs of Bellmer&#x27;s first doll arranged in a series of &quot;tableaux vivants&quot; (living pictures). The book was not credited to him, as he worked in isolation, and his photographs remained almost unknown in Germany. Yet Bellmer&#x27;s work was eventually declared &quot;degenerate&quot; by the Nazi Party, and he was forced to flee Germany to France in 1938, where Bellmer&#x27;s work was welcomed by the Surrealists around André Breton.

He aided the French Resistance during the war by making fake passports. He was imprisoned in the Camp des Milles prison at Aix-en-Provence, a brickworks camp for German nationals, from September 1939 until the end of the Phoney War in May 1940.

After the war, Bellmer lived the rest of his life in Paris. Bellmer gave up doll-making and spent the following decades creating erotic drawings, etchings, sexually explicit photographs, paintings, and prints of pubescent girls. In 1954, he met Unica Zürn, who became his companion until her suicide in 1970. He continued working into the 1960s. Of his own work, Bellmer said, &quot;What is at stake here is a totally new unity of form, meaning and feeling: language-images that cannot simply be thought up or written up … They constitute new, multifaceted objects, resembling polyplanes made of mirrors … As if the illogical was relaxation, as if laughter was permitted while thinking, as if error was a way and chance, a proof of eternity.”

Bellmer died 24 February 1975 of bladder cancer. He was buried beside Zürn at Père Lachaise Cemetery with a tomb marked &quot;Bellmer – Zürn&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The 2003 film &quot;Love Object&quot; contains clear references to Bellmer&#x27;s work, including the protagonist&#x27;s obsessive relationship with a sex doll and the use of Bellmer&#x27;s name as a leading character, Lisa Bellmer.

&quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot;, a 2004 anime film, features elements of Bellmer&#x27;s erotic and uncanny dolls. Additionally, director Mamoru Oshii has referred to Bellmer&#x27;s dolls as an inspiration for the film.

The New York-based avant-garde band Naked City used images of Bellmer&#x27;s dolls for the front cover and liner notes of their final album, &quot;Absinthe&quot;..

He was portrayed in the 2023 TV series &quot;Transatlantic&quot;.

<doc id="340320" wikidata="Q1424691" url="?curid=340320" title="MacArthur Foundation">
<text>The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation is a private foundation that makes grants and impact investments to support non-profit organizations in approximately 117 countries around the world. It has an endowment of $7.6 billion and provides approximately $260 million annually in grants and impact investments. It is based in Chicago, and in 2014 it was the 12th-largest private foundation in the United States. It has awarded more than US$8.27 billion since its first grants in 1978.

The foundation&#x27;s stated purpose is to support &quot;creative people, effective institutions, and influential networks building a more just, verdant, and peaceful world&quot;. MacArthur&#x27;s grant-making priorities include mitigating climate change, reducing jail populations, decreasing nuclear threats, supporting nonprofit journalism, and funding local needs in its hometown of Chicago. According to the OECD, the foundation&#x27;s financing for 2019 development increased by 27% to US$109 million.
The MacArthur Fellows Program, commonly referred to as the &quot;genius&quot; award, annually gives $800,000 no-strings-attached grants to around two dozen creative individuals in diverse fields &quot;who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits&quot;. The foundation&#x27;s &quot;100&amp;Change&quot; competition awards a $100 million grant every three years to a single proposal.

==History==
John D. MacArthur owned Bankers Life and Casualty and other businesses, as well as considerable property holdings in Florida and New York. His wife, Catherine, held positions in many of these companies. Their attorney, William T. Kirby, and Paul Doolen, their chief financial officer, suggested that the family create a foundation to be endowed by their vast fortune. 

When MacArthur died on January 6, 1978, he was worth in excess of a billion dollars. He left 92 percent of his estate to found the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Its first board of directors, per MacArthur&#x27;s will, also included J. Roderick MacArthur, John&#x27;s son from his first marriage, two other officers of Bankers Life and Casualty, and radio commentator Paul Harvey. Jonas Salk, the inventor of the polio vaccine, later joined the board of directors.

The elder MacArthur believed in the free market. However, he did not direct how foundation money was to be spent after he died. MacArthur told the board of directors, &quot;I figured out how to make the money. You fellows will have to figure out how to spend it.&quot;

Between 1979 and 1981, John&#x27;s son, an ideological opponent of his father with whom the elder MacArthur had an acrimonious relationship, waged a legal battle against the foundation for control of the board of directors. The younger MacArthur sued eight members of the board, accusing them of mismanagement of the foundation funds. These court cases were dismissed by each jurisdiction for lack of merit.

In 1984, MacArthur again sued the board of directors including William Kirby, his father&#x27;s trusted attorney, asking a Cook County circuit court to liquidate the entire MacArthur Foundation. He dropped the suit later that year when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

==Leadership==
John E. Corbally, the first president of the foundation and later board chairman from 1995 to 2002, was followed in 1989–99 by Adele Simmons, who was the first female dean at Princeton University. Jonathan Fanton, president of American Academy of Arts and Sciences, served as the foundation&#x27;s next president. Robert Gallucci, formerly dean of Georgetown University&#x27;s School of Foreign Service, served as the foundation&#x27;s fourth president from 2009 to 2014. Gallucci was fired in 2014. Julia Stasch, who formerly served as MacArthur&#x27;s vice president for U.S. Programs, was named the foundation&#x27;s president in 2015. Stasch had been chief of staff to Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley. She announced that she would step down in 2019. In March 2019, John Palfrey was named president, effective September 1, 2019.

==MacArthur Fellowship==
The MacArthur Fellowship is an award issued by the MacArthur Foundation each year, to typically 20 to 30 citizens or residents of the United States, of any age and working in any field, who &quot;show exceptional merit and promise for continued and enhanced creative work&quot;. The program was initiated in 1981. According to the foundation, the fellowship is not a reward for past accomplishment, but an investment in a person&#x27;s originality and potential. , MacArthur Fellows receive $625,000 each, which is paid out in quarterly installments over five years. The Chicago Foundation for Women was one of the nonprofit organizations to receive a US$1 million four-year grant in 2017. No one can apply for the program, and, generally, no one knows whether they are being considered as a candidate. Nominators, serving confidentially, anonymously and for a limited time, are invited to recommend potential Fellows. Candidates are reviewed by a selection committee whose members also serve confidentially, anonymously and for a limited time. Ultimately, the selection committee makes recommendations to the foundation&#x27;s board of directors for final approval.

==Specific funding and projects==
===Stalker Human Rights Film Festival===
The foundation awarded a total of around $850,000 in six separate grants to the Russian Guild of Film Directors between 2005 and 2014 to support the Stalker Human Rights Film Festival in Moscow.

===100&amp;Change===
In June 2016, the foundation requested &quot;proposals promising real progress toward solving a critical problem of our time in any field or any location&quot;. The winning proposal would receive a $100 million grant. Almost 2,000 proposals were submitted. In December 2017, the foundation announced that the winning proposal was submitted by the Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee. The grant was applied to the education of Middle Eastern refugee children.

===The Just Home Project===
In May 2022, The MacArthur Foundation, partnered with the Urban Institute announced the launch of a housing stability program designed to break the links between housing instability and jail incarceration. The Just Home Project will provide the communities of Charleston County, South Carolina, Minnehaha County, South Dakota; The city and county of San Francisco; and Tulsa County, Oklahoma with $5 million in grant funding to create a unique plan to bring together government officials, non-profit partners, and impacted communities members to develop innovative approaches to this issue. MacArthur has awarded $3.2 million in support of the work in the selected communities and an additional $1.8 million will support the Urban Institute&#x27;s technical assistance work.

<text>Theodor Karl Ernst Adolf Liebknecht (19 April 1870 – 6 January 1948) was a German socialist politician and activist.

==Biography==
Born in Leipzig in 1870 as the son of Wilhelm Liebknecht and the brother of Karl Liebknecht, Theodor Liebknecht studied law and worked, together with his brother Karl and Oskar Cohn, as a lawyer in Berlin from 1899 on, becoming politically active after his brother&#x27;s murder in January 1919.

Liebknecht was a member of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), opposed to the merger with the KPD and the joining of the Comintern but also to the reunification of the party with the SPD, he continued the USPD as an independent party with Georg Ledebour until its merger into the &quot;Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands&quot; (SAPD, &quot;Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Germany&quot;) in 1931.

In 1922 he accompanied Kurt Rosenfeld, Emile Vandervelde and Arthur Wauter as foreign socialist lawyers who participated in the defence of the Socialist Revolutionaries in the 1922 Moscow Trial of Socialist Revolutionaries.

In 1924, he was involved in the split of the &quot;Sozialistischer Bund&quot; together with Georg Ledebour.

A right-wing member of the SAPD, he was opposed to the introduction of Leninist schemes of organization into the party. Following the Nazi rise to power, he emigrated to Basel, Switzerland in 1933 and was later employed by the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam from 1936 to 1939. He was a supporter of the 2½ International.

Liebknecht died in , Brome, Germany, in 1948.

<doc id="340328" wikidata="Q2915083" url="?curid=340328" title="Jāti">
<text>Jāti is the term traditionally used to describe a cohesive group of people in the Indian subcontinent, like a tribe, community, clan, sub-clan, or a religious sect. Each Jāti typically has an association with an occupation, geography or tribe. Different intrareligious beliefs (e.g. Vaishnavism or Smarthism or Shaivism) or linguistic groupings may also define some Jātis. The term is often translated approximately in English as &quot;caste&quot;.

== Meaning ==
Professor Madhav Gadgil (1999) has described Jātis as goal governing, closed communities, based on his research in rural Maharashtra: 

Under the Jāti system, a person is born into a Jāti with ascribed social roles and endogamy, i.e. marriages take place only within that Jāti. The Jāti provides identity, security and status and has historically been open to change based on economic, social and political influences (a process known as sanskritisation). In the course of Indian history, various economic, political and social factors have led to a continuous closing and churning in the prevailing social ranks which tended to become traditional, hereditary system of social structuring.

This system of thousands of exclusive, endogamous groups, is called Jāti. Though there were minor variations in its manifestation across the breadth of the Indian subcontinent, generally the Jāti was the effective community within which one married and spent most of one&#x27;s social, religious and cultural life. Often it was the community (Jāti) which provided support in difficult times, in old age and even in the resolution of disputes. It was thus the community which one also sought to promote.

With the passage of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, inter-jati and inter-varna marriages (which together constitute what is colloquially referred to as &quot;intercaste marriage&quot;) are now legally sanctioned in Hindu-majority India. In practice, however, intercaste marriage remains rare and Indian society remains highly segregated along jati lines.

== Overlap with varnas ==

The British, since 1901, for the purposes of the Decennial Census, fitted all the Jatis into one or the other of the varna categories as described in Brahminical literature. The Census Commissioner had this to say, &quot;The principle suggested as a basis was that of classification by social precedence as recognized by native public opinion at the present day, and manifesting itself in the facts that particular castes are supposed to be the modern representatives of one or other of the castes of the &quot;theoretical&quot; Hindu system&quot;.
This deliberately ignored the fact that there are innumerable Jātis that straddled two or more Varnas, based on their occupations. As a community in south India commented, &quot;We are soldiers and saddle makers too&quot; – but it was the enumerators who decided their caste. Since pre-historic times, Indian society had a complex, inter-dependent, and cooperative political economy. One text, the Laws of Manu (c. 200 BC), conceptualized a system of idealized occupational categories (Varna), from the perspective of the Brahmin scholars. Although this scholarly work was unknown to the public during the Islamic period and even before, it gained prominence when the British administrators and Western scholars used it in the late 18th century, to gain an understanding of traditional Hindu law in India and translated it into English.

Crispin Bates noted in 1995 that

== Self-identity narratives ==
For instance, the Yadavs, a prominent backward class today, believe that &quot;Even in the Vedic age the Yadavs were upholders of the Republican ideals of government. ... The Mahabharata furnishes interesting details regarding the functioning of the republic form of government among the Yadavs. ... It is now an agreed fact that Sri Krishna, the central figure of the epic narratives, tried to defend the republican ideas against the imperialistic movement led by Jarasandha of Magadaha and Kamsa of Mathura&quot; (R. V. K. Yadav, quoted by Lucia Michelutti in &quot;Caste and modern politics in a north Indian town&quot;).

Dalits also have &quot;the stories that assert the glory of the caste, identify legendary figures who, the narrators imagine, have played pivotal roles in building their caste identity. The facts of the past are interspersed with myth and fantasy to create a new perception of a past that is glorious, pure and exclusive. This in turn is accorded historical status and imagined to have existed from time immemorial (Seneviratne 1997: 5). This kind of history, which seeks authenticity from written sources and from the self-interpretation of so-called archaeological remains, is sustained by commemorations such as feasts, fasts, celebrations and the creation of new symbols like flags and emblems based on these ...&quot;

<text>The Watts riots, sometimes referred to as the Watts Rebellion or Watts Uprising, took place in the Watts neighborhood and its surrounding areas of Los Angeles from August 11 to 16, 1965. The riots were motivated by anger at the racist and abusive practices of the Los Angeles Police Department, as well as grievances over employment discrimination, residential segregation, and poverty in L.A.

On August 11, 1965, Marquette Frye, a 21-year-old African-American man, was pulled over for drunk driving. After he failed a field sobriety test, officers attempted to arrest him. Marquette resisted arrest, with assistance from his mother, Rena Frye; a physical confrontation ensued in which Marquette was struck in the face with a baton. Meanwhile, a crowd of onlookers had gathered. Rumors spread that the police had kicked a pregnant woman who was present at the scene. Six days of civil unrest followed, motivated in part by allegations of police abuse. Nearly 14,000 members of the California Army National Guard helped suppress the disturbance, which resulted in 34 deaths, as well as over $40 million in property damage. It was the city&#x27;s worst unrest until the Rodney King riots of 1992.

==Background==

In the Great Migration of 1915–1940, major populations of African Americans moved to Northeastern and Midwestern cities such as Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York City to pursue jobs in newly established manufacturing industries; to cement better educational and social opportunities; and to flee racial segregation, Jim Crow laws, violence and racial bigotry in the Southern states. This wave of migration largely bypassed Los Angeles.

In the 1940s, in the Second Great Migration, black workers and families migrated to the West Coast in large numbers, in response to defense industry recruitment efforts at the start of World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 directing defense contractors not to discriminate in hiring or promotions, opening up new opportunities for minorities. The black population in Los Angeles dramatically rose from approximately 63,700 in 1940 to about 350,000 in 1965, rising from 4% of L.A.&#x27;s population to 14%.

===Residential segregation===
Los Angeles had racially restrictive covenants that prevented specific minorities from renting and buying property in certain areas, even long after the courts ruled such practices illegal in 1948 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. At the beginning of the 20th century, Los Angeles was geographically divided by ethnicity, as demographics were being altered by the rapid migration from the Philippines (U.S. unincorporated territory at the time) and immigration from Mexico, Japan, Korea, and Southern and Eastern Europe. In the 1910s, the city was already 80% covered by racially restrictive covenants in real estate. By the 1940s, 95% of Los Angeles and southern California housing was off-limits to certain minorities. Minorities who had served in World War II or worked in L.A.&#x27;s defense industries returned to face increasing patterns of discrimination in housing. In addition, they found themselves excluded from the suburbs and restricted to housing in East or South Los Angeles, which includes the Watts neighborhood and Compton. Such real-estate practices severely restricted educational and economic opportunities available to the minority community.

Following the US entry into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the federal government removed and interned 70,000 Japanese-Americans from Los Angeles, leaving empty spaces in predominantly Japanese-owned areas. This further bolstered the migration of black residents into the city during the Second Great Migration to occupy the vacated spaces, such as Little Tokyo. As a result, housing in South Los Angeles became increasingly scarce, overwhelming the already established communities and providing opportunities for real estate developers. Davenport Builders, for example, was a large developer who responded to the demand, with an eye on undeveloped land in Compton. What was originally a mostly white neighborhood in the 1940s increasingly became an African-American, middle-class dream in which blue-collar laborers could enjoy suburbia away from the slums.

In the post-World War II era, suburbs in the Los Angeles area grew explosively as black residents also wanted to live in peaceful white neighborhoods. In a thinly-veiled attempt to sustain their way of life and maintain the general peace and prosperity, most of these suburbs barred black people, using a variety of methods. White middle-class people in neighborhoods bordering black districts moved en masse to the suburbs, where newer housing was available. The spread of African Americans throughout urban Los Angeles was achieved in large part through blockbusting, a technique whereby real estate speculators would buy a home on an all-white street, sell or rent it to a black family, and then buy up the remaining homes from Caucasians at cut-rate prices, then sell them to other black families at hefty profits.

The Rumford Fair Housing Act, designed to remedy residential segregation, was overturned by Proposition 14 in 1964, which was sponsored by the California real estate industry, and supported by a majority of white voters. Psychiatrist and civil rights activist Alvin Poussaint considered Proposition 14 to be one of the causes of black rebellion in Watts.

In 1950, William H. Parker was appointed and sworn in as Los Angeles Chief of Police. After a major scandal called Bloody Christmas of 1951, Parker pushed for more independence from political pressures that would enable him to create a more professionalized police force. The public supported him and voted for charter changes that isolated the police department from the rest of the city government.

Despite its reform and having a professionalized, military-like police force, William Parker&#x27;s LAPD faced repeated criticism from the city&#x27;s Latino and black residents for police brutalityresulting from his recruiting of officers from the South with strong anti-black and anti-Latino attitudes. Chief Parker coined the term &quot;thin blue line&quot;, representing the police as holding down pervasive crime.

Resentment of such longstanding racial injustices is cited as reason why Watts&#x27; African-American population exploded on August 11, 1965, in what would become the Watts Riots.

==Inciting incident==
On the evening of Wednesday, August 11, 1965, 21-year-old Marquette Frye, an African-American man driving his mother&#x27;s 1955 Buick while drunk, was pulled over by California Highway Patrol rookie motorcycle officer Lee Minikus for alleged reckless driving. After Frye failed a field sobriety test, Minikus placed him under arrest and radioed for his vehicle to be impounded. Marquette&#x27;s brother, Ronald, a passenger in the vehicle, walked to their house nearby, bringing their mother, Rena Price, back with him to the scene of the arrest.

When Rena Price reached the intersection of Avalon Boulevard and 116th Street that evening, she scolded Frye about drinking and driving as he recalled in a 1985 interview with the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;. However, the situation quickly escalated: someone shoved Price, Frye was struck, Price jumped an officer, and another officer pulled out a shotgun. Backup police officers attempted to arrest Frye by using physical force to subdue him. After community members reported that police had roughed up Frye and shared a rumor they had kicked a pregnant woman, angry mobs formed. As the situation intensified, growing crowds of local residents watching the exchange began yelling and throwing objects at the police officers. Frye&#x27;s mother and brother fought with the officers and eventually were arrested along with Marquette Frye. 

After the arrests of Price and her sons, the Frye brothers, the crowd continued to grow along Avalon Boulevard. Police came to the scene to break up the crowd several times that night, but were attacked when people threw rocks and chunks of concrete. A swath of Los Angeles was transformed into a combat zone during the ensuing six days.

==Riot begins==

After a night of increasing unrest, police and local black community leaders held a community meeting on Thursday, August 12, to discuss an action plan and to urge calm. The meeting failed. Later that day, Chief Parker called for the assistance of the California Army National Guard. Chief Parker believed the riots resembled an insurgency, compared it to fighting the Viet Cong, and decreed a &quot;paramilitary&quot; response to the disorder. Governor Pat Brown declared that law enforcement was confronting &quot;guerrillas fighting with gangsters&quot;.

The rioting intensified, and on Friday, August 13, about 2,300 National Guardsmen joined the police in trying to maintain order on the streets. Sergeant Ben Dunn said: &quot;The streets of Watts resembled an all-out war zone in some far-off foreign country, it bore no resemblance to the United States of America.&quot; The first riot-related death occurred on the night of August 13, when a black civilian was killed in the crossfire during a shootout between the police and rioters. Over the next few days, rioting had then spread throughout other areas, including Pasadena, Pacoima, Monrovia, Long Beach, and even as far as San Diego, although they were very minor in comparison to Watts. About 200 Guardsmen and the LAPD were sent to assist the Long Beach Police Department (LBPD) in controlling the unruly crowd.

By nightfall on Saturday, 16,000 law enforcement personnel had been mobilized and patrolled the city. Blockades were established, and warning signs were posted throughout the riot zones threatening the use of deadly force (one sign warned residents to &quot;Turn left or get shot&quot;). Angered over the police response, residents of Watts engaged in a full-scale battle against the first responders. Rioters tore up sidewalks and bricks to hurl at Guardsmen and police, and to smash their vehicles. Those actively participating in the riots started physical fights with police and blocked Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) firefighters from using fire hoses on protesters and burning buildings. Arson and looting were largely confined to local white-owned stores and businesses that were said to have caused resentment in the neighborhood due to low wages and high prices for local workers.

To quell the riots, Chief Parker initiated a policy of mass arrest. Following the deployment of National Guardsmen, a curfew was declared for a vast region of South Central Los Angeles. In addition to the Guardsmen, 934 LAPD officers and 718 officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department (LASD) were deployed during the rioting. Watts and all black-majority areas in Los Angeles were put under the curfew. All residents outside of their homes in the affected areas after 8:00p.m. were subject to arrest. Eventually, nearly 3,500 people were arrested, primarily for curfew violations. By the morning of Sunday, August 15, the riots had largely been quelled.

Over the course of six days, between 31,000 and 35,000 adults participated in the riots. Around 70,000 people were &quot;sympathetic, but not active.&quot; Over the six days, there were 34 deaths, 1,032 injuries, 3,438 arrests, and over $40 million in property damage from 769 buildings and businesses damaged and looted and 208 buildings completely destroyed, including 14 damaged public buildings and 1 public building completely destroyed. Many white Americans were fearful of the breakdown of social order in Watts, especially since white motorists were being pulled over by rioters in nearby areas and assaulted. Many in the black community, however, believed the rioters were taking part in an &quot;uprising against an oppressive system.&quot; In a 1966 essay, black civil rights activist Bayard Rustin wrote:

The whole point of the outbreak in Watts was that it marked the first major rebellion of Negroes against their own masochism and was carried on with the express purpose of asserting that they would no longer quietly submit to the deprivation of slum life.

Despite allegations that &quot;criminal elements&quot; were responsible for the riots, the vast majority of those arrested had no prior criminal record. Three sworn personnel were killed in the riots: a Los Angeles Fire Department firefighter was struck when a wall of a fire-weakened structure fell on him while fighting fires in a store, a Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s deputy was accidentally shot by another deputy while in a struggle with rioters, and a Long Beach Police Department officer was shot by another police officer during a scuffle with rioters. 23 out of the 34 people killed in the riots were shot by LAPD officers or National Guardsmen.

After the riots, the LAPD (Los Angeles police department) examined the process of how each incident was managed by law enforcement, making a realization of the flaws of its system, when handling situations of hostile crowds, or groups. 

==After the riots==
Debate rose quickly over what had taken place in Watts, as the area was known to be under a great deal of racial and social tension. Reactions and reasoning about the riots greatly varied based on the perspectives of those affected by and participating in the riots&#x27; chaos.

National civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke two days after the riots happened in Watts. The riots were partly a response to Proposition 14, a constitutional amendment sponsored by the California Real Estate Association and passed that had in effect repealed the Rumford Fair Housing Act. In 1966, the California Supreme Court reinstated the Rumford Fair Housing Act in the &quot;Reitman v. Mulkey&quot; case (a decision affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court the following year), declaring the amendment to violate the US constitution and laws.

A variety of opinions and explanations were published. Public opinion polls studied in the few years after the riot showed that a majority believed the riots were linked to communist groups who were active in the area protesting high unemployment rates and racial discrimination. Those opinions concerning racism and discrimination were expressed three years after hearings conducted by a committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights took place in Los Angeles to assess the condition of relations between the police force and minorities. These hearings were also intended to make a ruling on the discrimination case against the police for their alleged mistreatment of members of the Nation of Islam. These different arguments and opinions are often cited in continuing debates over the underlying causes of the Watts riots.

=== White flight ===
After the Watts Riots, white families left surrounding nearby suburbs like Compton, Huntington Park, and South Gate in large numbers. Although the unrest did not reach these suburbs during the riots, many white residents in Huntington Park, for instance, left the area.

With so much destruction of residential properties after the Watts Riots, black families began to relocate in other cities that had established black neighborhoods. One of these was the city of Pomona. The arrival of so many black families to Pomona caused White flight to take place there and saw many of those white families move to neighboring cities in the Pomona Valley.

=== McCone Commission ===
A commission under Governor Pat Brown investigated the riots, known as the McCone Commission, and headed by former CIA director John A. McCone. Other committee members included Warren Christopher, a Los Angeles attorney who would be the committee&#x27;s vice chairman, Earl C. Broady, Los Angeles Superior Court judge; Asa V. Call, former president of the State Chamber of Commerce; Rev. Charles Casassa, president of Loyola University of Los Angeles; the Rev. James E. Jones of Westminster Presbyterian Church and member of the Los Angeles Board of Education; Mrs. Robert G. Newmann, a League of Women Voters leader; and Dr. Sherman M. Mellinkoff, dean of the School of Medicine at UCLA. The only two African American members were Jones and Broady.

The commission released a 101-page report on December 2, 1965, entitled &quot;Violence in the CityAn End or a Beginning?: A Report by the Governor&#x27;s Commission on the Los Angeles Riots, 1965&quot;.

The McCone Commission identified the root causes of the riots to be high unemployment, poor schools, and related inferior living conditions that were endured by African Americans in Watts. Recommendations for addressing these problems included &quot;emergency literacy and preschool programs, improved police-community ties, increased low-income housing, more job-training projects, upgraded health-care services, more efficient public transportation, and many more.&quot; Most of these recommendations were never implemented.

=== Aftermath ===
Marquette Frye was convicted of drunk driving, battery and malicious mischief. On February 18, 1966 he received a sentence of 90 days in county jail and three years&#x27; probation. He received another 90-day jail term after a jury convicted him of battery and disturbing the peace on May 18, 1966. Over the 10-year period following the riots he was arrested 34 times. He died of pneumonia on December 20, 1986, at age 42. His mother, Rena Price, died on June 10, 2013, at age 97. She never recovered the impounded 1955 Buick which her son had been driving because the storage fees exceeded the car&#x27;s value. Motorcycle officer Lee Minikus died on October 19, 2013, at age 79.

<text>() is a Portuguese and Spanish martial art which developed in the regions along the Minho River: Minho, Trás-os-Montes, Pontevedra and Ourense, focusing on the use of a staff of fixed measures and characteristics. 

It was used for self-defense and also to settle arguments and matters of honour between individuals, families, and even villages. While popular in the northern mountains, it was practically unknown elsewhere, and those who did practice it were taught by masters from the North of Portugal and Galicia.

== History ==

Amid a conflict between nobles and liberals, the latter were forbidden from carrying or wearing swords. In response, liberals embraced staff combat, a practice that extended its influence across Portugal, reaching both the lower and noble classes. Many Portuguese immigrants skilled in these methods introduced this art to Brazil.

The popularity of this martial art was partly due to the demeanor of the northern folk, who valued personal and family honor enough to kill for it. It was also due in no small part to the relative ease of obtaining a staff as well as the versatility of such a tool: a staff or stick was almost universally present, used as a support for the long daily walks, to help cross the rivers, by the shepherds to protect the cattle from wild animals, and so on. There are references to this martial art being used by the guerrillas against the troops of Napoleon that were occupying Lisbon during the Peninsular War.

=== Origin ===

The origins of the &quot;jogo do pau&quot; are medieval civil techniques of combat, used in times of war by foot soldiers who were often poor peasants who could not afford a better weapon. Evidence of this are found, for instance, from reports on the Battle of Aljubarrota. The technique was incorporated into horseback riding in the medieval book by Edward I of Portugal (1391–1438). This martial art developed not in the urban areas more open to foreign influences, but in Galiza and the most isolated mountain regions of continental Portugal.
During the 19th century, &quot;jogo do pau&quot; was brought to Lisboa by northern masters, resulting in an amalgamation with the technique of the Gameirosabre, growing into a sports competition, removed from actual combat. It was practiced in clubs such as the Ginásio Clube Português and the Ateneu Comercial de Lisboa.

== Modern practice ==
In the 20th century, the practice of &quot;jogo do pau&quot; suffered a quick decline due to the migrations from rural areas to the cities and the greater ease in access to firearms. The players born between 1910 and 1930 were the last generation to experience the flowering of the sport. The memories of this generation provided a continuity in the 1970s, when the sport was revived. The driving force of this revival was Pedro Ferreira, followed by his student Nuno Curvello Russo, who dedicated his life&#x27;s ambition to &quot;jogo do pau&quot;, frequently visiting the North of Portugal, getting acquainted with surviving variants there, especially with the school of Cabeceiras de Basto. He studied at the Ateneu Comercial de Lisboa, whose master is now Manuel Monteiro. Today, the sport is still rather marginal in Portugal, but there is a stable number of practitioners organized in two federations: the &quot;Federação Portuguesa de Jogo do Pau&quot; and the &quot;Federação Nacional do Jogo do Pau Português&quot;. This art is also practised in the Azores and Madeira, and outside Portugal in Galicia, Spain.

<doc id="340336" wikidata="Q922131" url="?curid=340336" title="Artistic license">
<text>Artistic license (alongside more contextually-specific derivative terms such as poetic license, historical license, dramatic license, and narrative license) refers to deviation from fact or form for artistic purposes. It can include the alteration of grammar or language, or the rewording of pre-existing text.

==History==
The artistic license may also refer to the ability of an artist to apply smaller distortions, such as a poet ignoring some of the minor requirements of grammar for poetic effect. For example, Mark Antony&#x27;s &quot;Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears&quot; from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; would technically require the word &quot;and&quot; before &quot;countrymen&quot;, but the conjunction &quot;and&quot; is omitted to preserve the rhythm of iambic pentameter (the resulting conjunction is called an asyndetic tricolon). Conversely, on the next line, the end of &quot;I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him&quot; has an extra syllable because omitting the word &quot;him&quot; would make the sentence unclear, but adding a syllable at the end would not disrupt the meter. Both of these are examples of artistic license.

Another example of artistic license is the way in which stylized images of an object (for instance in a painting or an animated movie) are different from their real life counterparts, but are still intended to be interpreted by the viewer as representing the same thing. This can mean the omission of details, or the simplification of shapes and color shades, even to the point that the image is nothing more than a pictogram. It can also mean the addition of non-existing details, or exaggeration of shapes and colours, as in fantasy art or a caricature.

Certain stylizations have become fixed conventions in art; an agreement between artist and viewer that is understood and undebatable. A striking example is how in simple cartoon drawings&#x27; monochromatic white parts on a dark colored surface are immediately recognized by most viewers to represent the reflection of light on a smooth or wet surface.

In summary, artistic license is:

* Entirely at the artist&#x27;s discretion
* Intended to be tolerated by the viewer (cf. &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot;)
* Useful for filling in gaps, whether they be factual, compositional, historical or other gaps
* Used consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally (or even in tandem).

==Dramatic license==
Artistic license is often referred to as dramatic license when it involves the glamorization of real-world occupations for the sake of exciting television or cinematic experience. For example, &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; and other police procedural programs typically omit completely the more mundane aspects of the occupation such as paperwork, reports, administrative duties and other daily &quot;business-oriented&quot; aspects which in reality often constitute the majority of police work. They will also present other duties with much more action, suspense or drama than would be experienced in reality. The same is also true for many military-oriented adventure stories which often show high-ranking characters being allowed to continuously enter dangerous situations when in reality, they would usually be restricted to command-oriented and administrative duties.

==Controversy and criticism==
Artistic license often provokes controversy by offending those who resent the reinterpretation of cherished beliefs or previous works. Artists often respond to these criticisms by pointing out that their work was not intended to be a portrayal of something previous and should be judged only on artistic merit. Artistic license is a generally accepted practice, particularly when the result is widely acclaimed. William Shakespeare&#x27;s historical plays, for example, are gross distortions of historical fact but are nevertheless lauded as outstanding literary works.

Critical voices are sometimes raised when artistic license is applied to cinematic and other depictions of real historical events. While slight manipulation for dramatic effect of chronology and character traits are generally accepted, some critics feel that depictions that present a significantly altered reality are irresponsible, particularly because many viewers and readers do not know the actual events and may thus take the dramatized depiction to be true to reality. Examples of films and television series criticized for excessive use of dramatic license include Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Braveheart&quot;, Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Alexander&quot;, the HBO series &quot;Rome&quot;, 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot; and Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Tudors&quot;.

Writers adapting a work for another medium (e.g., a film screenplay from a book) often make significant changes, additions to, or omissions from the original plot in the book, on the grounds that these changes were necessary to make a good film. These changes are sometimes to the dismay of fans of the original work.

<doc id="340345" wikidata="Q192499" url="?curid=340345" title="Doctor of the Church">
<text>Doctor of the Church (Latin: &quot;doctor&quot; &quot;teacher&quot;), also referred to as Doctor of the Universal Church (Latin: &quot;Doctor Ecclesiae Universalis&quot;), is a title given by the Catholic Church to saints recognized as having made a significant contribution to theology or doctrine through their research, study, or writing.

, the Catholic Church has named 37 Doctors of the Church. Of these, the 18 who died before the Great Schism of 1054 are also held in high esteem by the Eastern Orthodox Church, although it does not use the formal title &quot;Doctor of the Church&quot;.

Among the 37 recognised Doctors, 28 are from the West and nine from the East; four are women and thirty-three are men; one is an abbess, three are nuns, and one is a tertiary associated with a religious order; two are popes, 19 are bishops, twelve are priests, and one is a deacon; and 27 are from Europe, three are from Africa, and seven are from Asia. More Doctors (twelve) lived in the fourth century than any other; eminent Christian writers of the first, second, and third centuries are usually referred to as the Ante-Nicene Fathers. The shortest period between death and nomination was that of Alphonsus Liguori, who died in 1787 and was named a Doctor in 1871 – a period of 84 years; the longest was that of Irenaeus, which took more than eighteen centuries.

Some other churches have similar categories with various names.

== Before the 16th century ==
In the Western church four outstanding &quot;Fathers of the Church&quot; attained this honour in the early Middle Ages: Gregory the Great, Ambrose, Augustine of Hippo, and Jerome. The &quot;four Doctors&quot; became a commonplace notion among scholastic theologians, and a decree of Boniface VIII (1298) ordering their feasts to be kept as doubles throughout the Latin Church is contained in his sixth book of Decretals (cap. &quot;Gloriosus&quot;, de relique. et vener. sanctorum, in Sexto, III, 22).

In the Byzantine Church, three Doctors were pre-eminent: John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, and Gregory of Nazianzus. The feasts of these three saints were made obligatory throughout the Eastern Empire by Leo VI the Wise. A common feast was later instituted in their honour on 30 January, called &quot;the feast of the three Hierarchs&quot;. In the Menaea for that day it is related that the three Doctors appeared in a dream to John Mauropous, Bishop of Euchaita, and commanded him to institute a festival in their honour, in order to put a stop to the rivalries of their votaries and panegyrists.

This was under Alexius Comnenus (1081–1118; see &quot;Acta SS.&quot;, 14 June, under St. Basil, c. xxxviii). But sermons for the feast are attributed in manuscripts to Cosmas Vestitor, who flourished in the tenth century. The three are as common in Eastern art as the four are in Western. Durandus (i, 3) remarks that Doctors should be represented with books in their hands. In the West analogy led to the veneration of four Eastern Doctors, Athanasius of Alexandria being added to the three hierarchs.

== Catholic Church ==
The details of the title &quot;Doctor of the Church&quot; vary from one autonomous ritual church to another.

=== Latin Church ===

In the Latin Church, the four Latin Doctors (Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory) had been given a special pre-eminence since the eighth century, but in 1298 Pope Boniface VIII declared them Doctors of the Church. Pope Pius V recognized the four Great Doctors of the Eastern Church (John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Athanasius of Alexandria) in 1568.

To these names others have subsequently been added. The requisite conditions are enumerated as three: &quot;eminens doctrina&quot;, &quot;insignis vitae sanctitas&quot;, &quot;Ecclesiae declaratio&quot; (i.e. eminent learning, a high degree of sanctity, and proclamation by the church). Benedict XIV explains the third as a declaration by the supreme pontiff or by a general council.

The decree is issued by the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints and approved by the pope, after a careful examination, if necessary, of the saint&#x27;s writings. It is not in any way an &quot;ex cathedra&quot; decision, nor does it even amount to a declaration that no error is to be found in the teaching of the Doctor. It is, indeed, well known that the very greatest of them are not wholly immune from error. Previously, no martyrs were on the list, since the Office and the Mass had been for Confessors. Hence, as Benedict XIV pointed out during his pontificate, Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus of Lyons, and Cyprian of Carthage were not called Doctors of the Church. This changed in 2022 when Pope Francis declared Irenaeus of Lyons the first martyred Doctor.

The Doctors&#x27; works vary greatly in subject and form. Augustine of Hippo was one of the most prolific writers in Christian antiquity and wrote in almost every genre. Some, such as Pope Gregory the Great and Ambrose of Milan, were prominent writers of letters. Pope Leo the Great, Pope Gregory the Great, Peter Chrysologus, Bernard of Clairvaux, Anthony of Padua and Lawrence of Brindisi left many homilies. Catherine of Siena, Teresa of Ávila, John of the Cross and Therese of Lisieux wrote works of mystical theology. Athanasius of Alexandria and Robert Bellarmine defended the church against heresy. Bede the Venerable wrote biblical commentaries and theological treatises. Systematic theologians include the Scholastic philosophers Anselm of Canterbury, Albert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas.

In the 1920 encyclical &quot;Spiritus Paraclitus&quot;, Pope Benedict XV refers to Jerome as the church&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Doctor&quot;.

Until 1970, no woman had been named a Doctor of the Church. Since then four additions to the list have been women: Teresa of Ávila (also known as Saint Teresa of Jesus) and Catherine of Siena by Pope Paul VI; Therese of Lisieux by Pope John Paul II; and Hildegard of Bingen by Benedict XVI. Teresa and Thérèse were both Discalced Carmelites, Catherine was a Dominican, and Hildegard was a Benedictine nun.

Traditionally, in the Liturgy, the Office of Doctors was distinguished from that of Confessors by two changes: the Gospel reading &quot;Vos estis sal terrae&quot; (&quot;You are the salt of the earth&quot;), Matthew 5:13–19, and the eighth Respond at Matins, from Ecclesiasticus 15:5, &quot;In medio Ecclesiae aperuit os ejus, * Et implevit eum Deus spiritu sapientiae et intellectus. * Jucunditatem et exsultationem thesaurizavit super eum.&quot; (&quot;In the midst of the Church he opened his mouth, * And God filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding. * He heaped upon him a treasure of joy and gladness.&quot;) The Nicene Creed was also recited at Mass, which is normally not said except on Sundays and the highest-ranking feast days. The 1962 revisions to the Missal dropped the Creed from feasts of Doctors and abolished the title and the Common of Confessors, instituting a distinct Common of Doctors.

On 20 August 2011, Pope Benedict XVI announced that he would soon declare John of Ávila a Doctor of the Church. It was also reported in December 2011 that Pope Benedict intended to declare Hildegard of Bingen as a Doctor of the Church, though she had not yet been canonized. Pope Benedict XVI declared Hildegard of Bingen a saint on 10 May 2012, clearing the way for her to be named a Doctor of the Church, then declared both John of Ávila and Hildegard of Bingen Doctors of the Church on 7 October 2012. 

Pope Francis declared the 10th-century Armenian monk Gregory of Narek the 36th Doctor of the Church on 21 February 2015. The decision was somewhat controversial, as Gregory was a monk of the Armenian Apostolic Church, a non-Chalcedonian church that was not in communion with the Catholic Church during Gregory&#x27;s life and has sometimes been described as monophysite. However, the Armenian Apostolic Church does not accept monophysitism, and in 1996, Pope John Paul II and Catholicos Karekin I, patriarch of the Armenian Apostolic Church, signed a joint declaration which said that the division between the two churches was due to historical misunderstandings, not a real difference in Christology. Further, Gregory had been recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church since it received the Armenian Catholic Church into full communion.

==== Proposed Doctors ====
In October 2018, on the occasion of the canonization of Oscar Romero, martyred Archbishop of San Salvador, José Luis Escobar Alas, the current Archbishop of San Salvador, petitioned Pope Francis to name Romero a Doctor of the Church.

In October 2019, the Polish Catholic Bishops Conference formally petitioned Pope Francis to consider making Pope John Paul II a Doctor of the Church in an official proclamation, in recognition of his contributions to theology, philosophy, and Catholic literature, as well as the formal documents of his papacy.

In January 2023, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco proposed that Pope Benedict XVI be declared a doctor of the Church &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, in view of his theological intelligence and contribution to the formation of current doctrine of the Catholic Church, such as the new catechism. In January 2024, Archbishop Georg Gänswein also spoke in favor of the pontiff&#x27;s canonization and his elevation to the status of doctor of the church.

In November 2023, the USCCB voted to support a petition by the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of England and Wales for the Vatican to name John Henry Newman a Doctor of the Church. The epithet &quot;Doctor amicitiae&quot; (Doctor of Friendship) has been suggested for St. John Henry Newman.

In April 2024, during a private audience Pope Francis received a formal request from the superior general of the Discalced Carmelites, Miguel Márquez Calle, to declare Teresa Benedicta of the Cross a Doctor of the Church. The Discalced Carmelites first launched an international commission to gather the necessary documentation required for the declaration in 2022, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of her conversion to Catholicism and the 80th anniversary of her martyrdom.

==== Other recognised Doctors ====
In addition, parts of the Catholic Church have recognised other individuals with this title. In Spain, Fulgentius of Cartagena, Ildephonsus of Toledo and Leander of Seville have been recognized with this title. In 2007 Pope Benedict XVI, in his encyclical &quot;Spe Salvi&quot;, called Maximus the Confessor &quot;the great Greek Doctor of the Church&quot;, though the Congregation for the Causes of Saints considers this declaration an informal one.

==== Scholastic epithets ====

Though not named Doctors of the Church or even canonized, many of the more celebrated doctors of theology and law of the Middle Ages were given an epithet which expressed the nature of their expertise. Among these are Bl. John Duns Scotus, &quot;Doctor subtilis&quot; (&quot;subtle doctor&quot;); Alexander of Hales, &quot;Doctor irrefragabilis&quot; (&quot;unanswerable doctor&quot;); Roger Bacon, &quot;Doctor mirabilis&quot; (&quot;wondrous doctor&quot;); William of Ockham, &quot;Doctor singularis et invincibilis&quot; (&quot;valuable and invincible doctor&quot;); Jean Gerson, &quot;Doctor christianissimus&quot; (&quot;most Christian doctor&quot;); and Francisco Suárez, &quot;Doctor eximius&quot; (&quot;exceptional doctor&quot;).

===Syro-Malabar Catholic Church===
The Syro-Malabar Catholic Church recognises Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory, Augustine, Athanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus and John Chrysostom, as well as Ephrem the Syrian, Isaac the Elder, Pope Leo I, John of Damascus, Cyril of Alexandria, Cyril of Jerusalem, Epiphanius of Salamis and Gregory of Nyssa.

=== Chaldean Catholic Church ===
The Chaldean Catholic Church honours as doctor Polycarp, Eustathius of Antioch, Meletius, Alexander of Jerusalem, Athanasius, Basil, Cyril of Alexandria, Gregory Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, John Chrysostom, Fravitta of Constantinople, Ephrem the Syrian, Jacob of Nisibis, Jacob of Serugh, Isaac of Armenia, Isaac of Nineveh, and Maruthas of Martyropolis.

== Eastern Orthodox Church ==
The Eastern Orthodox Church honors many of the pre-schism saints as well, but the term &quot;Doctor of the Church&quot; is not applied in the same way. One consistent use of the category is the trio of Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus and John Chrysostom, recognized as universal teachers and known as the Three Holy Hierarchs. The church also recognizes three saints with the title &quot;Theologos&quot; (Theologian): John the Evangelist, Gregory of Nazianzus and Symeon the New Theologian.

=== Russian Orthodox Church ===
The Russian Orthodox Church commemorates on 19 July the feast of Three Holy Russian Hierarchs: Demetrius of Rostov, Mitrophan of Voronezh and Tikhon of Zadonsk.

== Armenian Church ==
The Armenian Apostolic Church recognizes the Twelve Holy Teachers (&quot;Vardapets&quot;) of the Church
*Hierotheus the Thesmothete
*Dionysius the Areopagite
*Pope Sylvester I
*Athanasius of Alexandria
*Cyril of Alexandria
*Ephrem the Syrian
*Basil the Great
*Gregory Nazianzus
*Gregory of Nyssa
*Epiphanius of Salamis
*John Chrysostom
*Cyril of Jerusalem.

They also recognize their own saints Mesrob, Yeghishe, Movses Khorenatsi, David the Invincible, Gregory of Narek, Nerses III the Builder, and Nerses of Lambron as &quot;Doctors of the Armenian Church&quot; or the &quot;Armenian Doctors&quot;.

== Assyrian Church of the East ==
The Assyrian Church of the East recognizes Yeghishe, Diodorus of Tarsus, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Nestorius as Doctors of the Church.

== Anglicanism ==
The churches of the Anglican Communion tend not to use the term &quot;Doctor of the Church&quot; in their calendars of saints, preferring expressions such as &quot;Teacher of the Faith&quot;. Those thus recognized include figures from before and after the Reformation, most of whom are chosen among those already recognized as in the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. Those designated as Teachers of the Faith in the Church of England&#x27;s calendar of saints are as follows:

*Basil the Great
*Gregory of Nazianzus
*Hilary of Poitiers
*Francis de Sales
*Thomas Aquinas
*Cyril of Jerusalem
*Frederick Denison Maurice
*William of Ockham
*Anselm
*Catherine of Siena
*Athanasius
*Ephrem of Syria
*Sundar Singh of India
*Cyril of Alexandria
*Irenæus
*Bonaventure
*Gregory of Nyssa and his sister Macrina
*Brooke Foss Westcott
*Jeremy Taylor
*Bernard of Clairvaux
*Augustine of Hippo
*Gregory the Great
*John Chrysostom
*Sergius of Radonezh
*Jerome
*Teresa of Ávila
*Therese of Lisieux
*Richard Hooker
*William Temple
*Leo the Great
*John of Damascus
*Ambrose
*John of the Cross

Since all of the above appear in the calendar at the level of Lesser Festival or Commemoration, their celebration is optional. Similarly, because &quot;In the Calendar of the Saints, diocesan and other local provision may be made to supplement the national Calendar&quot;, those Doctors of the Church recognized by the Catholic Church may also be celebrated in the Church of England.

== Lutheranism ==
The Lutheran calendar of saints does not use the term &quot;Doctor of the Church&quot;. The calendar of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod refers to Martin Luther by the title of &quot;Doctor&quot; in recognition of his academic degree, Doctor of Theology from the University of Wittenberg in 1512.

<doc id="340356" wikidata="Q416058" url="?curid=340356" title="Sodium stearoyl lactylate">
<text>Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate (sodium stearoyl lactylate or SSL) is a versatile, FDA approved food additive used to improve the mix tolerance and volume of processed foods. It is one type of a commercially available lactylate. SSL is non-toxic, biodegradable, and typically manufactured using biorenewable feedstocks. Because SSL is a safe and highly effective food additive, it is used in a wide variety of products ranging from baked goods and desserts to pet foods.

As described by the Food Chemicals Codex 7th edition, SSL is a cream-colored powder or brittle solid. SSL is currently manufactured by the esterification of stearic acid with lactic acid and partially neutralized with either food-grade soda ash (sodium carbonate) or caustic soda (concentrated sodium hydroxide). Commercial grade SSL is a mixture of sodium salts of stearoyl lactylic acids and minor proportions of other sodium salts of related acids. The HLB for SSL is 10–12. SSL is slightly hygroscopic, soluble in ethanol and in hot oil or fat, and dispersible in warm water. These properties are the reason that SSL is an excellent emulsifier for fat-in-water emulsions and can also function as a humectant.

==Food labeling requirements==
To be labeled as SSL for sale within the United States, the product must conform to the specifications detailed in 21 CFR 172.846 and the “Food Chemicals Codex,” 3d Ed. (1981), pp. 300-301. In the EU, the product must conform to the specifications detailed in Regulation (EC) No 96/77. For the 7th edition of the FCC and Regulation (EC) No 96/77, these specifications are:

To be labeled as SSL for sale in other regions, the product must conform to the specifications detailed in that region&#x27;s codex.

==Food applications and maximum use levels==
SSL finds widespread application in baked goods, pancakes, waffles, cereals, pastas, instant rice, desserts, icings, fillings, puddings, toppings, sugar confectionaries, powdered beverage mixes, creamers, cream liqueurs, dehydrated potatoes, snack dips, sauces, gravies, chewing gum, dietetic foods, minced and diced canned meats, &quot;mostarda di frutta&quot;, and pet food. Approved uses and maximum use levels in the United States are described in 21 CFR 172.846 and 21 CFR 177.120. In the European Union, the approved uses and maximum use levels are described in Regulation (EC) No 95/2.

The largest marketed use of SSL is in yeast-raised bakery products. SSL is used in the majority of manufactured breads, buns, wraps, tortillas, and similar bread-based products to ensure consistent product quality. Use levels for baked goods will vary between 0.25 - 0.5% based on flour. The typical application level is 0.375% and will be adjusted depending on the type and quality of flour used.

Compared to calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate (CSL), SSL offers some advantages. First, SSL disperses and hydrates more readily in water than CSL. Therefore, SSL does not require pre-hydration. Second, SSL provides better crumb softening than CSL. SSL&#x27;s crumb softening effect is noticeable up to 5–7 days after baking. Third, in rich bread formulations (e.g. pan bread and hamburger buns), SSL provides better dough strengthening than CSL. Use of SSL in these formulations will yield (nearly) perfect symmetry in the finished baked good. Because of these characteristics, SSL is currently used in more baking applications than CSL.

Research has explored the possibility of replacing SSL with the use of enzymes. Enzyme technologies, by themselves, have not been able to completely replace SSL. A major limitation of enzymes is the production of gummy bread of unpredictable quality. Also, enzymes often do not augment dough strength, which is necessary to prevent loaf collapse during baking. Currently, enzymes are being used in conjunction with SSL to maximize the shelf life of bread. SSL is very good at increasing softness of bread during the first week after baking. Enzyme technology works best after the first five days of shelf life. Therefore, bread with optimal softness throughout the desired shelf life is obtained by using a combination of these technologies.

== Health and safety ==
Lactylates, including SSL, have been subjected to extensive safety evaluations prior to being FDA approved for use as a food additive. The oral LD50 of SSL for rats was established by Schuler and Thornton in 1952 as being over 25 g/kg body weight. In 2010, Lamb established the no-observed-adverse-effect level of SSL at 5% of the total diet and recommended an acceptable daily intake of 22.1 mg/kg bw/day for human consumption.

<doc id="340359" wikidata="Q333098" url="?curid=340359" title="Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington">
<text>Sir Robert Bruce Cotton, 1st Baronet (22 January 1570/71 – 6 May 1631) of Conington Hall in the parish of Conington in Huntingdonshire, England, was a Member of Parliament and an antiquarian who founded the Cotton library.

==Origins==
Sir Robert Cotton was born on 22 January 1571 in Denton, Huntingdonshire, the son and heir of Thomas Cotton (1544–1592) of Conington (son of Thomas Cotton of Conington, Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in 1547) by his first wife, Elizabeth Shirley, a daughter of Francis Shirley of Staunton Harold, Leicestershire.

The Cotton family originated at the manor of Cotton, Cheshire, from where they took their surname. They were prominent in Shropshire by the 16th century with centres of power at Alkington and Norton in Hales where a member of the family, Rowland Cotton, gave one of the first architectural commissions to Inigo Jones. The family was close to polymath and antiquarian Sir Rowland Hill, publisher of the Geneva Bible.

==Education==
Cotton was educated at King&#x27;s School, Peterborough and Westminster School where he was a pupil of the antiquarian William Camden, under whose influence he began to study antiquarian topics. He began collecting rare manuscripts as well as collecting notes on the history of Huntingdonshire when he was seventeen. He proceeded to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1585 and in 1589 entered the Middle Temple to study law. He began to amass a library in which the documents rivalled, then surpassed, the royal manuscript collections.

==Career==

Cotton was elected a Member of Parliament for Newtown, Isle of Wight in 1601 and as Knight of the Shire for Huntingdonshire in 1604.

He helped to devise the institution of the title of &quot;baronet&quot; as a means for King James I to raise funds: like a peerage, a baronetcy was heritable but, like a knighthood, it gave the holder no seat in the House of Lords.

One of his scarce monographs, &quot;Twenty-Four Arguments&quot;, proposed the bolstering of royal powers to suppress Catholic elements in England in the wake of the Popery Act 1627. His public anti-Catholicism brought him short-lived favour with the king.

Despite this early period of goodwill with King James I, his approach to public life, based on his immersion in the study of old documents, was essentially based on that &quot;sacred obligation of the king to put his trust in parliaments&quot; which in 1628 was expressed in his monograph &quot;The Dangers wherein the Kingdom now Standeth, and the Remedye&quot;.

From the Court party&#x27;s point of view, this was anti-royalist in nature, and the king&#x27;s ministers began to fear the uses being made of Cotton&#x27;s library to support pro-parliamentarian arguments. Thus it was confiscated in 1630 and returned only after his death to his heirs.

==Role in Parliament==
Cotton supported the claim of King James VI of Scotland to succeed Queen Elizabeth I on the English throne, and after the queen&#x27;s death was commissioned to write a work defending James&#x27;s claim to the throne, for which he was rewarded with a knighthood in 1603.

Cotton was elected to Parliament for Huntingdonshire in 1604, a constituency previously represented by his grandfather, Thomas Cotton. Cotton worked on the Committee on Grievances and in 1605–06 received the Bill pertaining to the Gunpowder Plot through his work on the Committee of Privileges. In 1607 he was reappointed to the Committee of Privileges. Cotton was appointed to the joint conference with the House of Lords during his work on the bill pertaining to the full union between Scotland and England in 1606–07.

In 1610, Cotton was nominated in first place to the Committee of Privileges. In 1610/11 the royal revenues were low, and Cotton wrote &quot;Means for raising the king’s estate&quot; in which he suggested the formation of the baronetcy, a new order of social rank, higher than the knight but lower than the baron.

Cotton was not elected to the 1614 Parliament. In 1621, Cotton advised James I on the impeachment of Sir Francis Bacon concerning the respective roles of the king and Parliament. In 1624, Cotton was elected to represent Old Sarum after the previous member, Sir Arthur Ingram, decided to sit for York.

He was subsequently elected to Parliament for Thetford (1625) and Castle Rising (1628).

==Society of Antiquaries==
Cotton reunited with his former schoolmaster William Camden in the late 1580s as an early member of the Society of Antiquaries. Camden was one of the greatest early antiquarians, whose 1586 work &quot;Britannia&quot; was a chorographical (topographical and historical) survey of Britain.

Cotton exerted little influence in the society until after his father&#x27;s death in 1592. In 1593, he was resident at the family seat of Conington Castle, which he rebuilt. He returned to London in 1598 and revived the Society and petitioned for a permanent academy for antiquarian studies, suggesting that Cotton&#x27;s collection of manuscripts be combined with the Queen&#x27;s library to form a national library. The plan did not receive royal approval.

The discussion of the Society in the summer of 1600 focused on ancient burial customs, probably the result of a recent visit to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall by Camden and Cotton during which they collected Roman coins, monuments and fossils. The trip appears to have initiated Cotton&#x27;s interest in Roman artefacts. The antiquarians Reginald Bainbridge and Lord William Howard offered Cotton Roman stones while the Essex antiquarian John Barkham arranged to send him Roman relics.

Cotton&#x27;s antiquarian studies influenced many people of his time and he was often sought after by other antiquarians for ideas. Below is a letter written by fellow antiquarian Roger Dodsworth to Cotton:
The last recorded meeting of the Society of Antiquaries was in 1607. Cotton, however, continued collecting.

==Marriage and progeny==
As a young man, Cotton may have contracted a (possibly irregular) marriage with Frideswide Faunt, daughter of William Faunt of Foston, Leicestershire, and sister of the Jesuit theologian Arthur Faunt. The marriage was recorded by William Burton, Frideswide&#x27;s nephew, but is not mentioned in Cotton&#x27;s own papers.

In about 1593 (the precise date is not known), he married Elizabeth Brocas, the daughter of William Brocas of Theddingworth in Leicestershire. This marriage took place about a year after the death of Cotton&#x27;s father, and helped to shore up his financial position, as Elizabeth was an heiress. Their subsequent marital history suggests that perhaps these factors outweighed personal compatibility.

By Elizabeth, Cotton had a son: Sir Thomas Cotton, 2nd Baronet (1594–1662). Sir Thomas in turn married Margaret Howard, by whom he had a son, Sir John Cotton (born 1621).

Sir Robert had an extensive circle of friends and a considerable capacity to charm, which he displayed both before and after marrying. He spent several years, and possibly more than a decade, living with the widowed Lady Hunsdon, perhaps as her lover during an overt separation from his wife. Eventually, the Cottons patched things up. Nonetheless, a reputation as something of a playboy attached to Sir Robert until the end of his life.

==Library==
The Cotton library was the richest private collection of manuscripts ever amassed. Of secular libraries, it outranked the Royal Library, the collections of the Inns of Court and the College of Arms. Cotton&#x27;s collection included several rare and old texts, including the original codex bound manuscript of Beowulf, written around the year 1000; the Lindisfarne Gospels, written in the 7th or 8th century; and the &quot;Codex Alexandrinus&quot;, a 5th-century manuscript of the Greek Bible. Cotton&#x27;s house near the Palace of Westminster became the meeting-place of the Society of Antiquaries of London and of all the eminent scholars of England. The library was eventually donated to the nation by Cotton&#x27;s grandson and is now housed in the British Library.

The physical arrangement of Cotton&#x27;s library continues to be reflected in citations to manuscripts formerly in his possession. His library was housed in a room long by six feet wide filled with bookpresses, each surmounted by the bust of a figure from classical antiquity. Counterclockwise, these were catalogued as Julius, Augustus, Cleopatra, Faustina, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. (Domitian had only one shelf, perhaps because it was over the door). Manuscripts are today designated by library, bookpress, and number: for example, the manuscript of &quot;Beowulf&quot; is designated &quot;Cotton Vitellius A.xv&quot;, and the manuscript of &quot;Pearl&quot; is &quot;Cotton Nero A.x&quot;.

==Role of family on the Cotton library==
Sir Robert Cotton began developing the works and manuscripts into a collection for his library shortly after the birth of his son in 1594. From the period 1609 to 1614 the deaths of various people (including Lord Lumley, Earl of Salisbury, Prince Henry, William Dethick and Northampton) all contributed to Sir Robert Cotton&#x27;s purchase of works for his library. 

Sir Robert Cotton is understood to have had a residence in Chester:
[e]arly in the 17th century, this Priory, or so much of as remained, was occupied as a dwelling-house by Sir Robert Cotton, the antiquary... there, according to tradition, he had been visited by Ben Jonson
and also in London; his wife and son remained in the country. 

During his father&#x27;s absence Thomas Cotton studied to eventually receive his BA on 24 October 1616 from Broadgates Hall, Oxford — the same year that Sir Robert Cotton returned to his wife Elizabeth and family (a result of a hiccup with the law involving the death of earl of Somerset). At that point, Sir Thomas Cotton had taken the responsibilities of the home and the library into his own hands.

In 1620, Thomas Cotton married Margaret Howard with whom he had his first son, Sir John Cotton, just one year later in 1621. Margaret Howard died in 1621-1622. In 1622 Thomas Cotton&#x27;s father, Sir Robert Cotton, permanently moved residence to Cotton House, Westminster, along with the library which remained in Cotton House until Sir Robert Cotton&#x27;s death in 1631. The relocation of the library and residence to Cotton House gave members of Parliament and government workers better access to the matter within the library to be used as resources for their work.
The Cotton library offered important and valuable sources of reference and knowledge to many people, such as John Selden, &quot;a frequent borrower from the library, and probably its protector during the civil wars&quot; as stated in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. Selden, in 1623 said of Cotton: “his kindness and willingness to make them [his collection of books and manuscripts] available to students of good literature and affairs of state&quot;. In keeping with the notion that John Selden was a common presence in the Cotton library, The British Library holds a list of thirteen works, and the locations of those volumes today, that had been lent to Seldon by Sir Robert Cotton.

After another hiccup with the government, Sir Robert Cotton was forced to close the library by Charles I because the content within the library was believed to be harmful to the interests of the Royalists in 1629. In September 1630 Sir Robert Cotton and Sir Thomas Cotton, together, petitioned for renewed access to their library. One year later, in 1631, Sir Robert Cotton died without knowing what the future held for his library, but wrote in his will that the library be left to his son Thomas Cotton and that it be passed down accordingly. After the death of his father, Sir Thomas Cotton married his second wife, Alice Constable, in 1640 with whom they had their son Robert Cotton in 1644. Sir Thomas Cotton&#x27;s &quot;ownership access to the Cotton library was more limited than under his father&quot; according to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, and Thomas Cotton maintained his ability to &quot;protect,&quot; &quot;improve&quot; and &quot;maximize the profits&quot; received during the civil war, as he had earlier on in his life as a result of his father&#x27;s absence. Upon the death of Sir Robert Cotton on 13 May 1662, Sir Thomas Cotton obeyed the will of his father and passed down the library to his eldest son from his first marriage, Sir John Cotton.

On 12 September 1702, Sir John Cotton died. Prior to his death, Sir John Cotton had arranged for the Cotton library to be bought for the nation of England through acts of Parliament. If the library had not been sold to the nation, despite the wish of his grandfather Sir Robert Cotton, the library would have been taken over and inherited by Sir John Cotton&#x27;s two grandsons, who, unlike the rest of the college-educated Cotton family, had been illiterate and put the library at risk of getting broken up and sold to different divisions within the family.

<text>Economic statistics is a topic in applied statistics and applied economics that concerns the collection, processing, compilation, dissemination, and analysis of economic data. It is closely related to business statistics and econometrics. It is also common to call the data themselves &quot;economic statistics&quot;, but for this usage, &quot;economic data&quot; is the more common term.

== Overview ==
The data of concern to economic statistics may include those of an economy within a region, country, or group of countries. Economic statistics may also refer to a subtopic of official statistics for data produced by official organizations (e.g. national statistical services, intergovernmental organizations such as United Nations, European Union or OECD, central banks, and ministries).

Analyses within economic statistics both make use of and provide the empirical data needed in economic research, whether descriptive or econometric. They are a key input for decision making as to economic policy. The subject includes statistical analysis of topics and problems in microeconomics, macroeconomics, business, finance, forecasting, data quality, and policy evaluation. It also includes such considerations as what data to collect in order to quantify some particular aspect of an economy and of how best to collect in any given instance.

<doc id="340365" wikidata="Q704374" url="?curid=340365" title="Seishirō Itagaki">
<text>was a Japanese military officer and politician who served as a general in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II and War Minister from 1938 to 1939.

He was a disciple of Kanji Ishiwara and his ideas were strongly influenced by his apocalyptic Buddhist beliefs, being firmly convinced of the idea of a &quot;Final War&quot; in which Japan would unite the entire world into a single nation, resulting in an era of true peace, regeneration and harmony.

Itagaki was a main conspirator behind the Mukden Incident and held prestigious chief of staff posts in the Kwantung Army and China Expeditionary Army during the early Second Sino–Japanese War. Itagaki became War Minister but fell from grace after Japanese defeat in the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, serving as general for several field armies until surrendering Japanese forces in Southeast Asia in 1945. Itagaki was convicted of war crimes by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and executed in 1948.

==Early life==
Seishirō Itagaki was born on 21 January 1885 in Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, into a former &quot;samurai&quot; family that had served the Nanbu clan of the Morioka Domain. Itagaki&#x27;s father, Masanori Itagaki, served as mayor for Kesen District and as a headmaster for a girls school. Itagaki was raised in a Nichiren Buddhist family belonging to the Nichiren-shū sect. Itagaki attended the junior high school in Morioka (at the same time Kyōsuke Kindaichi, Koshirō Oikawa, and Kodō Nomura) before attending the regional military school in Sendai.

==Military career==
Itagaki entered the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, where he befriended numerous notable Japanese military figures including Yasuji Okamura, Kenji Doihara, and Tetsuzan Nagata. Itagaki graduated from the Army Academy in 1904 and fought in the Russo–Japanese War. Itagaki married Kikuko Ogoshi, the daughter of his former mentor Kenkichi Ogoshi who died in the Battle of Mukden.

From 1924 to 1926, Itagaki was a military attaché assigned to the Japanese embassy in China. On his return to Japan, he held a number of staff positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff until 1927 before being given a field command as commanding officer of the IJA 33rd Infantry Brigade based in China. His brigade was attached to the IJA 10th Division from 1927 to 1928. Itagaki was then transferred to command the IJA 33rd Infantry Regiment in China from 1928 to 1929, under the aegis of the prestigious Kwantung Army. 

In 1931, Itagaki rose to become Chief of the Intelligence Section of the Kwantung Army, in which capacity he helped plan the Mukden Incident that led to the Japanese seizure of Manchuria. Itagaki was subsequently a military advisor to the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo from 1932 to 1934. In 1934, Itagaki became Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and in 1936 was promoted to Chief of Staff. From 1937 to 1938, Itagaki was commander of the IJA 5th Division in China during the early stages of the Second Sino–Japanese War, and his division took a leading part in the Battle of Beiping–Tianjin, Operation Chahar, and the Battle of Taiyuan. However, in the Battle of Xuzhou his forces were repulsed during the Battle of Taierzhuang in the vicinity of Linyi that prevented them from coming to the aid of Rensuke Isogai&#x27;s IJA 10th Division.

Itagaki was recalled to Japan in 1938, briefly serving as War Minister from 1938 to 1939. On 6 December 1938, Itagaki proposed a national policy in accordance with &quot;Hakko Ichiu&quot; (Expansion) at the Five Ministers Conference, which was the Japanese highest decision making council, and the council made a decision of prohibiting the expulsion of the Jews in Japan, Manchuria, and China as Japanese national policy. Itagaki returned to China again as chief of staff of the China Expeditionary Army from 1939 to 1941. However, in the summer of 1939, the unexpected defeat of Japanese forces against the Soviet Union at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol or &quot;Nomonhan incident&quot;, the decisive battle of the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, was a major blow to his career. On 7 July 1941, Itagaki was reassigned to command the Chosen Army in Korea, then considered to be a non-prestigious backwater post. He was able to prevent Masanobu Tsuji from being cashiered as the Emperor had wished due to Tsuji&#x27;s insolence and extreme &quot;gekokujō&quot; during the Nomonhan incident by instead having Tsuji transferred to a research unit at Formosa. While Itagaki was commander of the Chosen Army, Japan began assembling its nuclear weapons program with the industrial site near the Chosen reservoir as its equivalent to the Oak Ridge laboratory for the United States&#x27; Manhattan Project. As the war situation continued to deteriorate for Japan, the Chosen Army was elevated to the Japanese Seventeenth Area Army in 1945, with Itagaki still as commander in chief until 7 April 1945. Itagaki was then reassigned to the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaya in April 1945. Itagaki surrendered Japanese forces in Southeast Asia to British Admiral Louis Mountbatten in Singapore on 12 September 1945.

==Death==
After the war, Itagaki was taken into custody by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers authorities and charged with war crimes, specifically in connection with the Japanese seizure of Manchuria, his escalation of the war against the Allies during his term as War Minister, and for allowing inhumane treatment of prisoners of war during his term as commander of Japanese forces in Southeast Asia. Itagaki was found guilty on counts 1, 27, 29, 31, 32, 35, 36 and 54 and was condemned to death in 1948 by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Itagaki was hanged on 23 December 1948 at Sugamo Prison in Tokyo.

<doc id="340367" wikidata="Q7058241" url="?curid=340367" title="Northern College (Ontario)">
<text>Northern College of Applied Arts and Technology, commonly known as Northern College, is a college of applied arts and technology in Northern Ontario, Canada. It is partnered with private Pures College of Technology in Midland and Scarborough. The college&#x27;s catchment area extends across . More than 65 communities within Northeastern Ontario are served by four campuses located in Timmins, Kirkland Lake, Moosonee, and Temiskaming Shores (Haileybury). Annual enrolment is approximately 1,500 full-time students. Annual part-time and continuing education enrollment exceeds 11,000 students. Northern College is also home to the Haileybury School of Mines, which predates the college and was founded in 1912. 

==History==
Northern College was established during the formation of Ontario&#x27;s college system in 1967. Colleges of applied arts and technology were established on May 21, 1965. It is an Ontario College of Applied Arts and Technology. The school was founded in 1967 as part of a provincial initiative to create many such institutions to provide career-oriented diploma and certificate courses, as well as continuing education programs to Ontario communities.

The first campus was built in Kirkland Lake, followed by Porcupine (now part of the amalgamated city of Timmins), Haileybury (where the pre-existing Haileybury School of Mines joined as a campus; now part of the amalgamated city of Temiskaming Shores), and Moosonee, previously the James Bay Education Centre. The Northern College tartan was designed by Sylvia Martin.

Though the college traditionally drew students from Ontario&#x27;s hinterland, today 82% of the college&#x27;s students come from abroad, mostly from India. Ontario&#x27;s Ministry of Colleges and Universities caps the number of foreign students a public college can enroll at a private partner institution at two times the number of students at the home campus. However, in 2022 Northern&#x27;s partner Pures College of Technology had 8.6 times as many students as the Timmins campus.

Following a promise from former college president Audrey Penner that the decision would not turn into a public relation nightmare, Northern College came to international attention in 2023 after retroactively revoking college admissions for international students. At first revoking 500 students and later that year, revoking another 200 students. The college reported $84 million in international student revenue in 2023, an increase of $55 million from the previous year. Despite the additional revenue many students without housing were forced to seek emergency shelter through community organizations. The revocation of admission caused severe financial hardship for many students who had already bought flights to Canada and would no longer be allowed to enter the country, due to their visa being tied to their college admission. President Audrey Penner&#x27;s departure was announced later that year.

In 2024 the province of Ontario provided $2.1 million for new equipment and the college collected $98 million in revenue from international students. In 2025, the college announced layoffs predicting a budget deficit of $6 million.

* Moosonee Campus

== Timmins Campus ==
The Timmins Campus, which is the main campus of Northern College is located in Timmins, Ontario. It was constructed in the 1960s on the coast of Porcupine Lake. 

== Programs ==
In 2012-13 the most popular program was Collaborative Nursing followed by Social Service Worker. In 2019-20 the most popular program was Social Service Worker followed by Collaborative Nursing. Following a dramatic increase in foreign student enrollment in 2020-21 the most popular programs are now Business, and Computer Engineering Technology.

<doc id="340368" wikidata="Q7887383" url="?curid=340368" title="United American Free Will Baptist Conference">
<text>The United American Free Will Baptist Conference (UAFWBC) is a predominantly African-American, Free Will Baptist denomination founded in the United States.

==History==
Prior to emancipation, black slaves and free blacks were members of predominantly white, Free Will Baptist congregations in the United States. The first black Free Will Baptist minister was Robert Tash, ordained in 1827. African-Americans organized their first separate congregation in 1867 at Snow Hill in Greene County, North Carolina, the first annual conference in 1870, and the first association in 1887. The General Conference of United Free Will Baptists was formed in 1901. The United American Free Will Baptist Conference, was created in 1968 under the leadership of O. L. Williams of Lakeland, Florida, resulting from a division in the parent United American Free Will Baptist Church. 

In 2007 the United American Free Will Baptist Conference had seventy-five congregations with approximately 11,200 members, mostly in Florida, but also in South Carolina, Louisiana, and Arkansas. In addition to the annual meeting of the general conference, there are six regional conferences that meet annually: South Carolina Annual Conference, Louisiana/Arkansas Annual Conference, East Florida Annual Conference, West Florida Annual Conference, the South Florida &quot;A&quot; Annual Conference, and South Florida &quot;B&quot; Annual Conference.

== Organization ==
The United American Free Will Baptist Conference is led by its general bishop, an executive board, and college of bishops.

== Doctrine ==
The United American Free Will Baptists have an affirmation of faith, based upon the Nicene and Apostles&#x27; creeds; the denomination also adopts a church covenant. Additionally, the UAFWBC contains an extensive doctrinal statement. While congregationalist, the denomination&#x27;s offices are structured as bishops or elders, and deacons; and the denomination has female pastors.

<text>Telico is an unincorporated community in northeastern Ellis County, Texas, United States, on Highway 34.

==History==
The area that became Telico was settled before 1856. It was first called Trinity City but was renamed in the mid-1850s to Telico after Telico, North Carolina. The town was based on agriculture and had a cotton gin that local farmers used for several decades until they renovated it in the early 2000s to create a wedding venue.

<doc id="340370" wikidata="Q2818696" url="?curid=340370" title="Ninety-Two Resolutions">
<text>The Ninety-Two Resolutions were drafted by Louis-Joseph Papineau and other members of the &quot;Parti patriote&quot; of Lower Canada in 1834. The resolutions were a long series of demands for political reforms in the British-governed colony.

Papineau had been elected speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada in 1815. His party constantly opposed the unelected colonial government, and in 1828 he helped draft an early form of the resolutions, essentially a list of grievances against the colonial administration. To ensure that the views of the Legislative Assembly be understood by the British House of Commons, the &quot;Parti patriote&quot; had sent its own delegation to London in order to submit a memoir and a petition signed by 78,000 people.

On February 17, 1834, Elzéar Bédard introduced the Ninety-Two Resolutions in the Assembly. Papineau provided most of the arguments for the Resolutions in the subsequent debates. The Resolutions proved divisive, with some moderate supporters of the &quot;Parti patriote&quot; voting against them, such as John Neilson and Frédéric-Auguste Quesnel. The Assembly nonetheless approved the Resolutions by a large margin, 56–23, on February 21, 1834. The Assembly then sent the Resolutions to London. The resolutions included, among other things, demands for an elected Legislative Council and an Executive Council responsible before the house of representatives. Under the Constitutional Act of 1791, Lower Canada was given an elected legislative assembly, but members of the upper house were appointed by the governor of the colony. 

In the resolutions, the elected representatives once again reiterated their loyalty to the British Crown but expressed frustration that the government of London had been unwilling to correct the injustices caused by the past governments of the colony.

In response, the British government appointed the Royal Commission for the Investigation of all Grievances Affecting His Majesty&#x27;s Subjects of Lower Canada, chaired by the Governor, the Earl of Gosford, which produced several reports on the issues raised by the Resolutions. Meanwhile, the Legislative Assembly did all it could to oppose the un-elected upper houses while avoiding outright rebellion. Home Secretary Lord John Russell eventually responded to them by issuing ten resolutions of his own (the Russell Resolutions). All of the Legislative Assembly&#x27;s demands were rejected.

The ten resolutions reached Canada in 1837, and many of Papineau&#x27;s reformists began to agitate for a rebellion. See the Lower Canada Rebellion.

<text>Wilhelm Martin Philipp Christian Ludwig Liebknecht (; 29 March 1826 – 7 August 1900) was a German socialist activist and politician. He was one of the principal founders of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). He was the father of socialists Karl Liebknecht and Theodor Liebknecht.

Liebknecht participated in the German Revolution of 1848, and after its defeat lived in exile, where he met Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In 1862, he returned to Germany and worked with Ferdinand Lassalle in Berlin until disagreements with Lassalle&#x27;s General German Workers&#x27; Association (ADAV) led him to move to Saxony. In 1866, he and August Bebel founded the Saxon People&#x27;s Party, and in 1869 the two founded the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP). In 1875, Liebknecht helped to unite the SDAP and ADAV to form the party which later became the SPD, and was largely responsible for drafting its inaugural Gotha Program. Liebknecht was also a member of the Reichstag from 1874, and an important member of the Second International from 1889.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Wilhelm Liebknecht was born in 1826 in Giessen, the son of Katharina Elisabeth Henrietta (née Hirsch) and Hessian public official Ludwig Christian Liebknecht. Liebknecht grew up with relatives after the death of his parents in 1832. From 1832 to 1842, he went to school at the Gymnasium of Giessen, then began studying philology, theology and philosophy in Giessen, Berlin and Marburg. The life story of his maternal great-uncle, the Protestant pastor and democratic activist Friedrich Ludwig Weidig, influenced young Liebknecht&#x27;s social and political attitudes relatively early on. He studied the writings of Saint-Simon, from which he gained his first interest in communism, and had been converted to the extreme republican theories of which Giessen was a centre. After some trouble with the authorities as a result of participating in student radicalism, Liebknecht decided to emigrate to the United States.

While on a train to a port city, quite by chance, he met the headmaster of a progressive school in Zürich, Switzerland, and Liebknecht impulsively decided to accept an offer to be an unpaid teacher at that school. Thus he found himself in Switzerland in 1847 as a civil war began in that country. He reported these events for a German newspaper, the &quot;Mannheimer Abendzeitung&quot;, beginning a career in journalism that he would pursue for the next five decades.

=== Revolution of 1848 ===
When revolution erupted in Paris in February 1848, Liebknecht hurried to the scene. He arrived too late to do much in Paris, but he did join a legion that was traveling to Germany to instigate revolution there. During that poorly planned expedition, he was arrested in Baden and charged with treason. On the eve of his trial, revolution erupted once more, and a mob secured his release. He then became a member of the &quot;Badische Volkswehr&quot; and an adjutant of Gustav von Struve and fought in the ill-fated&quot; Reichverfassungskämpfe&quot; (&quot;federal constitution wars&quot;). After the revolutionaries&#x27; defeat, he escaped to Switzerland and became a leading member of the &quot;Genfer Arbeiterverein&quot; (Worker&#x27;s Association of Geneva), where he met Friedrich Engels.

=== Years of exile ===
In 1850, Liebknecht was arrested for his initiatives to unite Switzerland&#x27;s German workers&#x27; associations and was banished from the country. With few options available, like many veterans of the recently failed revolution, he relocated his exile to London, where he stayed from 1850 to 1862. There he became a member of the Communist League. During these years, he developed a lifelong friendship and collaboration with Karl Marx. In 1862, after an amnesty for the participants in the revolution of 1848, he returned to Germany and became a member of Ferdinand Lassalle&#x27;s General German Workers&#x27; Association (&quot;Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein&quot;, ADAV), the precursor of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).

=== Return to Germany ===
From 1864 to 1865, Liebknecht also worked for the magazine &quot;Der Social-Demokrat&quot; (&quot;The Social Democrat&quot;) published by Jean Baptista von Schweitzer. However, he soon found himself in disagreement with the paper&#x27;s friendly position toward Prussia and its new Minister-President Otto von Bismarck. Liebknecht quit the editorial staff and was forced to leave the ADAV due to pressure from Schweitzer. After being evicted from Berlin by government authorities, Liebknecht moved to Leipzig, where he met August Bebel, with whom he founded the &quot;Sächsische Volkspartei&quot; (Saxon People&#x27;s Party) in 1867 and the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Germany (&quot;Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands&quot;, SDAP) in 1869 in Eisenach. During these years, he was elected to the national legislature, where he conducted a determined but futile opposition to Bismarck&#x27;s policies. Liebknecht was also the editor of the party newspaper, &quot;Der Volksstaat&quot; (&quot;The People&#x27;s State&quot;).

When the Franco-Prussian War began in 1870, Liebknecht used his newspaper to agitate against the war, calling on working men on both sides of the border to unite in overthrowing the ruling class. As a result, he and Bebel were arrested and charged with treason. Liebknecht opposed the war regardless of which side started it. His call for revolutionary opposition to the war directly contradicts what his party (the SPD) would do in 1914 when World War I began as at that time, with Liebknecht long dead, his successors opted to back the German cause in the war.

=== Treason trial ===
In 1872, both Liebknecht and Bebel were convicted and sentenced to two years of &quot;Festungshaft&quot; (&quot;imprisonment in a fortress&quot;). This was one of sixteen times that Liebknecht&#x27;s politics resulted in his conviction and incarceration.

=== Return to politics ===

After being re-elected to the Reichstag in 1874, Liebknecht played a key role in the merger of the SDAP and Lassalle&#x27;s ADAV into the (&quot;Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands&quot;, SAPD) in Gotha in 1875. He also became publisher of the newly founded party organ &quot;Vorwärts&quot; (&quot;Forward&quot;), arguing for the integration of Marxist theories into the SAPD&#x27;s program in his articles.

From 1878 to 1890, the German government outlawed Liebknecht&#x27;s party, but the terms of the law allowed the party to participate in elections and its elected delegates to participate in the Reichstag. Liebknecht used his position as a Reichstag member to criticize the political situation and opposed the tendencies in his own party toward anarchism on the one hand and accommodation with Bismarck on the other. Maintaining a radical and unified stance, the SAPD emerged from outlawry in 1890 as the Social Democratic Party of Germany (&quot;Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands&quot;, SPD), taking 20% of the vote in the Reichstag election.

In 1891, Liebknecht became editor-in-chief of &quot;Vorwärts&quot; and one of the originators of the SPD&#x27;s new Marxist-inspired party platform. Throughout that decade, he continued to serve in the Reichstag and to appear at political conventions of the SPD as a prominent participant. Despite his advanced age, he also was a major organizer of the Second International, successor to the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association.

=== Death and legacy ===

Liebknecht died aged 74 on 7 August 1900 in Charlottenburg, a suburb of Berlin. 50,000 people joined his funeral procession. His grave now forms part of the &quot;Memorial to the Socialists&quot; () in the Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery, Berlin.

<text>René Gerónimo Favaloro (July 12, 1923 – July 29, 2000) was an Argentine cardiac surgeon and educator best known for his pioneering work on coronary artery bypass surgery using the great saphenous vein.

== Early life ==
Favaloro was born in 1923 and raised in La Plata; his grandparents were Sicilians from the island of Salina.

The surname Favaloro is derived from the Sicilian word Favaloru, referring to one who grows or sells beans; the term can also be used to denote a scrounger.

In 1936, Favaloro was admitted into the Colegio Nacional de La Plata. After graduating from high school, he was admitted to the School of Medicine at the National University of La Plata. During his third year, he began his medical residency at the &quot;Hospital Policlínico San Martín&quot;, a medical center that received the most complicated cases from much of Buenos Aires province. This residency brought him into contact with patients for the first time. He attended procedures carried out by professors José María Mainetti and Federico E. B. Christmann, from whom he learned the simplicity and standardization that he would later apply to cardiovascular surgery, one of his many great contributions to cardiovascular operating techniques. Favaloro graduated with a medical degree in 1949.

He then applied for a position as a medical auxiliary, but the offer required him to enroll in the Peronist Party, which he did not accept. He moved instead to a small town named Jacinto Aráuz in La Pampa Province after being offered a job as the town&#x27;s doctor; when the resident doctor died, he succeeded him and brought his brother Juan José into the clinic. He married María Antonia Delgado in 1951.

Favaloro and his brother endeavored to improve the general level of health in what was then a remote region. They trained and educated the general public, teachers, and nurses and improved health-care delivery. They equipped the town with an operating room and X-ray and improved the laboratory, thereby providing essential surgical and diagnostic tools.

== Thoracic surgery ==

Favaloro became interested in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery. During a visit to La Plata, he met Professor José María Mainetti, who pointed him in the direction of the Cleveland Clinic. Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought that he could make a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason Sones, Jr., who was in charge of the Angiography Laboratory, and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology.

In the beginning, the major part of his work involved valvular and congenital diseases; later on, he became interested in other areas. Every day, having hardly finished working in the operating room, Favaloro would spend hours and hours reviewing coronary angiograms and studying coronary arteries and their relation with the cardiac muscle. The laboratory of Sones, father of the coronary angiography, had the largest collection of angiograms in the United States.

In early 1967, Favaloro began to consider the possibility of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He put his ideas into practice for the first time in May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment of a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called coronary artery bypass surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of coronary disease. In 1970, he published one of his best-known volumes, &quot;Surgical Treatment of Coronary Arteriosclerosis&quot;.

==The Favaloro Foundation==

Favaloro returned to Argentina in 1971 with the dream of developing a center of excellence similar to the Cleveland Clinic, that combined medical attention, research, and education.

Bearing that in mind, he founded the Fundación Favaloro in 1975 along with several collaborators. He took pride in having trained more than 450 residents from all over Argentina and the Americas. Favaloro contributed to raise the standard level of his specialty for the benefit of patients through innumerable courses, seminars, and conferences organized by the Fundación, among them the distinguished &quot;Cardiology for the Consultant&quot; (&quot;Cardiología para el Consultante&quot;), held every two years.

In 1980 Favaloro established the &quot;Basic Investigation Laboratory&quot; (&quot;Laboratorio de Investigación Básica)&quot;, which was long financed with his own money and which, at the time, depended upon the support of the Research and Teaching Department of the Fundación Favaloro. Subsequently, it became the Institute of Research in Basic Sciences of the University Institute of Biomedical Sciences (&quot;Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias Básicas del Instituto Universitario de Ciencias Biomédicas&quot;) which in turn, was transformed into the Universidad Favaloro in August 1998.

In 1992 the nonprofit Favaloro Foundation Institute of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery (&quot;Instituto de Cardiología y Cirugía Cardiovascular de la Fundación Favaloro&quot;) opened in Buenos Aires. With the motto &quot;advanced technology in the service of medical humanism&quot;, this institute offers highly specialized services of cardiology, cardiovascular surgery and heart, lung, cardiopulmonary, liver, kidney, and bone marrow transplants, among other areas. Favaloro focused his career there, surrounded by a selected group of professionals. One of his more famous patients was boxing promoter and Luna Park arena owner Tito Lectoure, on whom Favaloro operated in 1990. It should be mentioned, however, that despite the immense costs of bypass surgery, Favaloro operated daily on indigent patients, something that he felt was both a necessity and his obligation.

He kept his emphasis on disease prevention and promoting basic rules of hygiene to reduce mortality rate. With that objective, the Fundación Favaloro researches illness detection and prevention programs. Also, many publications were released by the Centro Editor de la Fundación Favaloro (Publishing Center of the Favaloro Foundation), which ceased to operate in 2000. The Favaloro Foundation is currently one of the largest institutions dedicated to cardiology in the Americas.

== Death ==
By 2000, Argentina was submerged in an economic and political crisis, and the Favaloro Foundation was US$18 million in debt. On repeated occasions, Favaloro petitioned the Argentine government to aid the Foundation, but never received an official response, nor would the director of the PAMI public medical insurance agency, Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, agree to pay the agency&#x27;s debt to the Foundation. On July 29, 2000, at age 77, Favaloro fatally shot himself in the chest.

Following his suicide, it was revealed that he had written a letter to Argentine President Fernando de la Rúa, that had never been read, in which he expressed being tired of &quot;being a beggar in his own country,&quot; and asked for de la Rúa&#x27;s help to raise money for the Foundation.

Although his suicide is often linked to the Foundation&#x27;s financial difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro felt overwhelmed by the corruption of the health system and that he could not fight against it. In the letter, he refers to himself as &quot;Don Quixote&quot; in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.

== Recognition and distinctions ==
In a tribute written shortly after Favaloro&#x27;s death, fellow heart surgeon Denton Cooley wrote: &quot;Although he was always hesitant to carry the moniker of &#x27;father&#x27; of coronary artery bypass surgery, he is the surgeon we should credit with introducing coronary bypass surgery into the clinical arena.&quot; Favaloro was an active member of 26 societies, corresponding of 4, and honorary of 43. He received innumerable international distinctions. The ones that stand out are: John Scott Prize 1979, granted by Philadelphia; the creation of the Chair of Cardiovascular Surgery &quot;Dr René G. Favaloro&quot; (Tel Aviv University, Israel, 1980); the distinction of the &quot;Fundación Conchita Rábago de Giménez Díaz&quot; (Madrid, Spain, 1982); the Teacher Prize of Argentinian Medicine (1986); the Distinguished Alumnus Award of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (1987); The Gairdner Foundation International Award, granted by the Gairdner Foundation (Toronto, Canada, 1987); the René Leriche Prize 1989, granted by the International Surgery Society; the Gifted Teacher Award, granted by the American College of Cardiology (1992); the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1993); the Diamond Konex Award as the most important scientist in the last decade in his country (Argentina, 1993); and the Prince Mahidol Award, granted by His Majesty the King of Thailand (Bangkok, Thailand, 1999).

In 2007, he was named the second-greatest Argentine of all time, on the TV show &quot;El Gen Argentino&quot;.

On July 12, 2019, Google showed a Doodle celebrating what would have been his 96th birthday.

== Favaloro on television ==
Favaloro participated in educational programming for the public, distinguishing himself in the television series &quot;The Great Medical Themes&quot;, and in numerous conferences in Argentina and throughout the world on topics such as medicine, education, and modern society. He was also mentioned in the documentary movie &quot;Forks Over Knives&quot;.

== Works ==

<doc id="340377" wikidata="Q715235" url="?curid=340377" title="Kanji Ishiwara">
<text>was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II. He and Seishirō Itagaki were the men primarily responsible for the Mukden Incident that took place in Manchuria in 1931.

==Early life==
Ishiwara was born in Tsuruoka City, Yamagata Prefecture, into a &quot;samurai&quot; class family. His father was a police officer, but as his clan had supported the Tokugawa bakufu and then the Northern Alliance during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, its members were shut out of higher government positions.

At 13, Ishiwara was enrolled in a military preparatory school. He was subsequently accepted at the 21st class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and graduated in 1909. He served in the IJA 65th Infantry Regiment in Korea after its annexation by Japan in 1910, and in 1915, he passed the exams for admittance to the 30th class of the Army Staff College. He graduated second in his class in 1918.

Ishiwara spent several years in various staff assignments and then was selected to study in Germany as a military attaché. He stayed in Berlin and in Munich from 1922 to 1925, focusing on military history and military strategy. He hired several former officers from the German General Staff to tutor him, and by the time that he returned to Japan, he had formed a considerable background on military theory and doctrine.

Ishiwara was also the leader of a semi-religious and Pan-Asianist organization, the East-Asia League Movement (&quot;Tōarenmei undō&quot; 東亜連盟運動).

== Beliefs ==
Prior to leaving for Germany, Ishiwara had converted to Nichiren Buddhism. Nichiren taught that &#x27;[Japan is] superior to India, China and eighty thousand other countries&#x27;, and that, though the Degenerate Age has arrived, there is still hope by believing in the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, and Japan would the land where the teaching of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; would prevail, whence it would be propagated to the rest of the world.

Inspired by Hans Delbrück, Ishiwara proposed that there are two types of war: protracted and decisive. Japan must unify Asia under its leadership, in preparation for a protracted war with the West under American leadership. He also hoped that an intervention of Manchuria would awaken Japan to its historical mission. He expected that before the final war, Japan would fight a war with America over who can control China, and Japan would prevail.

Ishiwara felt that the period of world conflict was fast approaching, and Japan, relying upon its vision of the &quot;kokutai&quot; and its sacred mission to &quot;liberate&quot; China, would lead a unified East Asia to defeat the West. He claimed &quot;Japan must be victorious, not for the sake of her own national interest, but for the salvation of the world.&quot;

In &quot;On World Final War&quot;, he argued that technology determines the history of war, and the history of war determines history. There will soon be a final war, which would be decided by the air war. Future aircraft would be powered by new sources of power, such that they can remain flying almost indefinitely, and they would fly long distances to strike directly at other nations&#x27; capitals. To avoid this, Japan should dismantle the cities and disperse industry into agricultural communities, resulting in the &quot;unity of agriculture and industry&quot;.

==Ishiwara and Manchuria==

Ishiwara was assigned to the Army Staff College as an instructor, followed by a staff position within the Kwantung Army in Manchuria. He arrived there at the end of 1928, some months after the assassination of Zhang Zuolin. Ishiwara quickly realized that the confused political situation in northern China, along with Japan&#x27;s already significant economic investments in the area, provided the Kwantung Army with a unique opportunity. He and Colonel Seishiro Itagaki began formulating a plan to take advantage of the situation.

On 18 September 1931, a bomb was secretly planted on the tracks of the Japanese-controlled Southern Manchuria Railway by Kwantung Army elements. Charging that Chinese soldiers had attacked the rail line, Ishiwara ordered Japanese troops to seize the Chinese military barracks in the nearby city of Liutiaokou. He then ordered Kwantung Army units to seize control of all other Manchurian cities without informing the new commander-in-chief of the Kwantung Army, General Shigeru Honjo, or the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in Tokyo.

The sudden invasion of Manchuria alarmed political leaders in Japan, and brought condemnation down on the country from the international community. Ishiwara thought it most likely that he would be executed or at least dishonorably discharged for his insubordination. However, the success of the operation brought just the opposite. Ishiwara was admired by right-wing younger officers and ultranationalist societies for his daring and initiative. In 1932, he traveled to Europe as a military attaché of the Japanese delegation to attend the Geneva Conference. In August 1933, He returned to Japan and was given command of the IJA 4th Infantry Regiment in Sendai.

==Army revolutionaries==
Ishiwara was appointed to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in 1935 as Chief of Operations, which gave him primary responsibility for articulating his vision for Japan&#x27;s future. He was a strong proponent of pan-Asianism and the &quot;hokushin-ron&quot; (&quot;strike north&quot;) philosophy, as opposed to the &quot;nanshin-ron&quot; (&quot;strike south&quot;) philosophy espoused by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). The strike north view held that Japan should join with Manchukuo (the Japanese puppet state created out of occupied Manchuria in 1932) and China to form an &quot;East Asian League&quot;, which would then prepare for and fight a war with the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union was defeated, Japan could move to the south to free Southeast Asia from European colonial rule. Following this victory, Japan would then be ready to tackle the United States.

However, in order to implement these plans, Japan would need to build up its economy and military. Ishiwara envisioned a one-party &quot;national defense state&quot; with a command economy in which political parties were abolished and venal politicians and greedy businessmen removed from power.

However, Ishiwara stopped short of calling for a Shōwa Restoration and violent overthrow of the government. When the February 26 Incident erupted in 1936, rebels assassinated a number of major politicians and government leaders and demanded a change in government in line with Ishiwara&#x27;s philosophies. However, Ishiwara dashed their hopes by speaking out strongly against the rebellion and demanding proclamation of martial law. After Vice Chief of Staff Hajime Sugiyama pulled troops in from garrisons around Tokyo, Ishiwara was named Operations Officer of the Martial Law Headquarters.

==Return to Manchukuo and disgrace==
In March 1937 Ishiwara was promoted to major general and transferred back to Manchukuo as Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. He discovered to his dismay that his Army colleagues had no intention of creating a new pan-Asian paradise, and were quite content to play the role of colonial occupiers. Ishiwara denounced the Kwantung Army leadership, and proposed that all officers take a pay cut. He confronted the Kwantung Army commander-in-chief, General Hideki Tojo, over his allocation of funds to an officers&#x27; wives club. After becoming an embarrassment to his seniors, he was relieved of command and reassigned to a local army base at Maizuru, on the seacoast near Kyoto.

Back in Japan, he began to analyze Soviet tactics at Nomonhan, where Japanese forces were defeated, proposing counter-strategies to be adopted by the Army. He wrote and gave public addresses, continuing to advocate an East Asia League partnership with China and Manchukuo and continuing to oppose the invasion of China. He became a lieutenant general in 1939 and was assigned command of the IJA 16th Division.

Ishiwara&#x27;s political nemesis, Tōjō, now risen to the highest ranks, felt that the outspoken Ishiwara should be retired from the Army, but feared the reactions of young officers and right-wing activists. Finally, after Ishiwara publicly denounced Tōjō as an enemy of Japan who should &quot;be arrested and executed,&quot; he was put on the retired list. Ishiwara went back to Yamagata, where he continued to write and study agriculture until the end of the war.

==Last years and death==
After World War II, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers called upon Ishiwara as a witness for the defense in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. No charges were ever brought against Ishiwara himself, possibly due to his public opposition to Tōjō, the war in China, and the attack on Pearl Harbor. He displayed his old fire in front of the American prosecutor, arguing that U.S. President Harry S. Truman should be indicted for the mass bombing of Japanese civilians. Ishiwara claimed that it was the Americans who forced to Japan, which had been isolated until the 19th century, to open door and encouraged Japanese to learn about the aggression of Great Powers. He sarcastically said that Commodore Matthew C. Perry, who led Japan into international competition, should be summoned and punished as a war criminal.

Since the fall of 1946, he lived on a farm in Takase-mura, Yamagata Prefecture, and died of bladder cancer on 15 August 1949.

<text>Sir Sidney George Holland (18 October 1893 – 5 August 1961) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 25th prime minister of New Zealand from 13 December 1949 to 20 September 1957. He was instrumental in the creation and consolidation of the New Zealand National Party, which was to dominate New Zealand politics for much of the second half of the 20th century.

Holland was elected to parliament in , and became the second Leader of the National Party, and Leader of the Opposition, in 1940. He served briefly (1942) in a war cabinet but thereafter attacked the Labour government for its interventionist economic policies. Holland led the National Party to its first election victory in . His National government implemented moderate economic reforms, dismantling many state controls. Holland&#x27;s government also undertook constitutional change in 1950, by abolishing the Legislative Council, the upper house of parliament, on the grounds that it was ineffectual.

In 1951, Holland, having confronted locked out dockers and coal miners intent on what he called &quot;industrial anarchy&quot;, called a snap election and was re-elected Prime Minister. In its second term, the National government signed the ANZUS defence agreement with Australia and the United States. Holland led his party to a third consecutive victory in 1954. Following ill health in 1957, Holland stepped down as Prime Minister to be replaced by Keith Holyoake.

==Early life==

Sidney Holland was born in Greendale in the Canterbury region of the South Island, the youngest child and fourth son of a family of eight children. His father, Henry Holland, was a farmer and merchant, who served as Mayor of Christchurch between 1912 and 1919 and became the Reform Party MP for Christchurch North between 1925 and 1935. During the First World War, Holland enlisted as a territorial in the New Zealand Military Forces in 1915 and later rose to the rank of second lieutenant. He served with the New Zealand Field Artillery and saw action during the Battle of Messines, before being invalided home after contracted a severe illness. Due to his injuries, Holland was hospitalised for six months and lost a lung.

Holland was a prominent sportsman and sports administrator, representing Canterbury at provincial and inter-island level in hockey. After retiring from playing, he managed the New Zealand representative hockey team on an unbeaten tour of Australia in the 1932 and was a prominent hockey referee. After the war, Holland and one of his brothers established the Midland Engineering Company in Christchurch, which manufactured horticultural spray pumps and operated a profit-sharing scheme with its employees. Holland later married Florence Drayton in 1920 and the couple raised a family of two boys and two girls. According to his biographer Barry Gustafson, Holland was raised as a Methodist but later became an Anglican.

==Early political career==




Following his father Henry Holland&#x27;s election to the New Zealand Parliament in 1925, Sidney served as his father&#x27;s unofficial private secretary and campaign manager between 1925 and 1935. Due to this experience, Holland gained an intimate knowledge and interest in parliamentary politics. During the Great Depression, Holland also became the President of both the Canterbury Employers&#x27; Association and the Christchurch Businessmen&#x27;s Club, which brought into contact with the conservative New Zealand Legion and the short-lived Democrat Party, which opposed the Forbes–Gordon Coates United-Reform coalition Government. As a result of his political experiences, Holland developed a distaste for Communism.

After his father Henry was incapacitated in a serious accident, the older Holland and encouraged Sidney to take his place as the Reform Party candidate for Christchurch North during the 1935 general elections. Holland successfully retained the Christchurch North seat despite the Labour Party&#x27;s landslide victory during that election. The new Michael Joseph Savage–Peter Fraser Labour Government, which ushered in a raft of social and economic reforms including the establishment of a Keynesian welfare state, nationalization of key economic resources, and the expansion of public works and state-housing projects. In response to Labour&#x27;s electoral success, the Reform and United Parties merged in 1936 to form the National Party, which represented the farming and growing manufacturing sectors of New Zealand society.

==Leader of the Opposition: 1940–1949==

In 1940, Holland replaced National&#x27;s first non-interim leader Adam Hamilton as the leader of the National Party. Prior to becoming the Party&#x27;s leader, he had served as Hamilton&#x27;s parliamentary secretary. As leader of the National Party, Holland sought to win the support of the party&#x27;s farming constituency by establishing a farm in North Canterbury and breeding Romney sheep and Aberdeen Angus cattle. In addition, he also countered other rival conservative parties like the Liberal Party, the Soldier&#x27;s Movement, and the People&#x27;s Movement by co-opting them into the National Party in 1941. This merger helped strengthen National&#x27;s support base by unifying opposition to the Labour Party. Holland served as Leader of the Opposition for nearly ten years until the National Party won the 1949 general election. He represented the Christchurch North electorate from 1935 to 1946, and then the Fendalton electorate from 1946 to 1957.

Following Japan&#x27;s entry into the Second World War in 1941, the Labour Government reluctantly acquiesced to the establishment of a bipartisan War Administration in July 1942, consisting of seven Labour Ministers and six National Ministers. Sidney Holland served as the Deputy Chairman of the short-lived War Cabinet, which collapsed in September 1942 after the National Party objected to Labour&#x27;s handling of an unofficial miners&#x27; strike in the Waikato region that same month. Holland&#x27;s decision strained relations with both the Labour Government and several National MPs including Gordon Coates and Adam Hamilton, who withdrew from the National caucus and rejoined the War Cabinet as independents. The resignation of these two former Reform Party MPs helped strengthen Holland&#x27;s control over the party caucus and organisation.

During the 1943 and 1946 general elections, National slowly eroded Labour&#x27;s parliamentary majority. While the Labour Party still remained in power, it was forced to contend with a more vigorous opposition National Party. Under Holland&#x27;s leadership, National repeatedly attacked the Labour Party&#x27;s socialism, &quot;big government&quot; bureaucracy, collectivism, and the power of the trade unions. Some important policies propagated by the National Party included individual freedom, a free market, minimum bureaucratic intervention, restriction and regulation, and an acceptance of the welfare state. Holland repositioned the National Party to accept (albeit reluctantly) the main elements of Labour&#x27;s welfare state, a policy switch seen as necessary for the party to become electable. During the successful 1949 general election, Holland capitalised on the threat of Communist expansion in Eastern Europe, the government&#x27;s perceived unwillingness to counter the militant waterfront unions, persisting wartime restrictions, and rising inflation. This strategy secured National&#x27;s electoral victory on 30 November 1949.

==Prime Minister, 1949–1957==

===First term, 1949–1951===
The Sidney Holland National Government implemented economic reforms, dismantling many state controls including butter and petrol rationing. His government also emphasised individualism, personal freedom, and private enterprise in accordance with its 1949 electoral platform. One of Holland&#x27;s first acts as Prime Minister was to abolish the Legislative Council, the upper house of the country&#x27;s Parliament on 1 December 1950. As a result, the New Zealand Parliament became a unicameral body consisting solely of the House of Representatives. Besides serving as Prime Minister, Holland also served as the Minister of Finance. However, Holland did not carry on with his Party&#x27;s promise to abolish compulsory unionism, which Labour had introduced in 1936. Due to opposition from several trade unions, the government compromised by simply passing a law forcing unions to obtain majority support in a vote before the union could make donations to the opposition Labour Party, which was traditionally associated with the trade unions.

In 1950, the National Government reinstated the death penalty, which had been phased out by the previous Labour Government in 1935 and abolished for murder in 1941. Another eight executions were carried out through Holland&#x27;s administration (out of 36 murder convictions, 22 of whom had resulted in a death sentence). To solve the partisan-infected issue Holland called for a referendum to be held on the same day as the general election of 1957, but the proposal failed to make the ballot. No executions were carried out under Holland&#x27;s successor, Keith Holyoake, and in 1961 Holyoake oversaw a vote in which Parliament voted 41–30 (with eleven National MPs crossing the floor) to abolish capital punishment for murder.

In 1951, Prime Minister Sidney Holland faced a major challenge from the militant Waterside Workers&#x27; Union during the 1951 waterfront dispute (13 February – 11 July 1951). The 1951 waterfront dispute was sparked by the refusal of shipowners to give a 15 per cent wage rise to the watersiders who proceeded to ban overtime work. The shipowners retaliated by imposing a lock-out on striking workers. When the watersiders refused to accept arbitration, the National Government imposed emergency regulations under the 1932 Public Safety Conversation Act which drastically curtailed civic liberties, including the freedom of speech and expression. The Regulations were designed to silence and criminalise any support for the watersiders, including food supplies for their families, and pro-watersider publications. In addition, Holland ordered the armed forces to unload cargo from ports and deregistered the Waterside Union and seized its funds. After 151 days, the watersiders capitulated.

The National Government&#x27;s actions were popular with the public and press. The opposition Labour Party and the Federation of Labour, the national trade union-governing body, also acquiesced to the government&#x27;s tough stance on the watersiders due to their acrimonious relationship with the Waterside Union. After the Labour opposition criticised the government&#x27;s policy, Holland called a snap election on 11 July 1951. The National Party was re-elected with an increased majority, with the backing of a largely conservative Press and the state-controlled radio broadcasters. According to former journalist and historian Redmer Yska, Prime Minister Holland and his government exploited anti-Communist sentiment during the waterfront dispute. Due to the Cold War atmosphere emerging in New Zealand, Holland was able to depict the watersiders as part of the &quot;Red Peril&quot; that was threatening Western democracy. According to the historian Barry Gustafson, the 1949 and 1951 elections marked the peak of Sidney Holland&#x27;s political career. The National Party was to stick with his extremely tough attitude towards unions for decades.

===Second term, 1951–1954===
After 1951 the National Government continued its policy of deregulating the economy by ending rationing on basic food commodities, loosening import controls, and encouraging home ownership by selling states houses to their tenants. Shortly after being re-elected, the government also enacted the Police Offences Bill which gave the police substantial powers to deal with future industrial unrest. Holland&#x27;s Government also reformed the superannuation scheme to enable retiring public servants to claim a portion of their entitlement as a lump sum payment. In addition, the Government established producer-controlled agricultural boards. Despite its centre-right orientation, the National Government maintained the previous Labour Government&#x27;s policies of full employment and the welfare state. While the 1950s was a boom time for New Zealand and other Western economies, inflation remained a problem.

On the foreign policy front, the National Government embedded New Zealand in a series of Western Cold War security alliances and defence agreements. In September 1951, the government signed the ANZUS defence agreement with Australia and the United States. As a member of the Western alliance, the National Government also sent New Zealand troops to the Korean War. A demand for woollen clothing during the conflict created a brief economic boom for New Zealand&#x27;s sheep farmers. In September 1954, New Zealand ratified the Manila Pact and joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, an American-sponsored regional collective defense organisation aimed at combating the spread of Communism in Southeast Asia. Later, in January 1955, New Zealand&#x27;s traditional ties to Britain and a fear of the Communist domino effect led Prime Minister Holland to contribute New Zealand troops to the Malayan Emergency. According to the historian David McIntyre, Holland had little interest in foreign affairs and was the first Prime Minister to delegate that portfolio to another cabinet minister. During the Holland era, New Zealand had three foreign ministers: Frederick Doidge, Clifton Webb, and Tom Macdonald.

At the 1954 general election, National&#x27;s support declined, due to public dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living and housing. Altogether the party&#x27;s vote dropped by nearly 100,000 from the 1951 electoral figure. The National Party also had to contend (as it had not needed to do in 1951) with a new third party: the Social Credit Political League, which won 122,573 votes. In addition, the Labour Party polled more votes than National but failed to reduce National&#x27;s numerical majority in Parliament; the country&#x27;s First-past-the-post voting system enabled it to maintain a majority of 10 electorate seats. Besides, Gustafson suggests that the appearance of Social Credit split the opposition vote.

During the electoral campaign, in what was to be a portent of his 1956–57 troubles, Holland&#x27;s health deteriorated markedly. He kept losing his voice, forcing him to limit his speeches to half an hour. Following the 1954 election, the National Government set up a royal commission to examine the country&#x27;s monetary system. This commission released a report condemning Social Credit theories.

===Third term, 1954–1957===

Once the National Government had been assured of a third consecutive term, Holland gave up the finance portfolio to Jack Watts, the former Minister of Industries and Commerce. With the loss of one National MP (W.F. Fortune) and the retirement of several older ministers, Holland rejuvenated his Cabinet with several younger men including Dean Eyre, Sid Smith, John McAlpine, Tom Shand, Geoff Gerard, and Eric Halstead. In 1955 the annual terminal income tax assessment system was phased out in favor of a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system. Also, the Tourist Hotel Corporation was established with Holland&#x27;s strong support and against the opposition of Holyoake (by this time Deputy Prime Minister), who feared that tourism would divert investment away from agriculture. After Dean Eyre went on a private overseas business trip in 1956, Holland introduced a code of ethics that banned any conflict of interest between a minister&#x27;s public duty and private affairs.

During Holland&#x27;s last years in office, New Zealand also faced a serious balance of payments crisis that had been precipitated by a rapid decline in overseas demand for the country&#x27;s butter, wool, and cheese exports. In addition, Holland&#x27;s health was proving less and less able to withstand the strain of his duties, and his memory began to fail him. Amid the Suez Crisis in October 1956, Holland suffered a mild heart attack or stroke (accounts vary) while working in his office. However, far from retreating to bed, he insisted on remaining at the office for the next 48 hours until the crisis was resolved. According to his biographer Gustafson, Holland&#x27;s physique never fully recovered from that incident. During the Suez Crisis, New Zealand and Australia were among the few countries to defend the Anglo-French invasion of the Suez Canal.

Despite his conspicuous medical problems, Holland was initially reluctant to hand over the Party&#x27;s leadership to his deputy, Holyoake. But following a meeting the following year with several senior National Party officials including Holyoake himself, John Marshall, Jack Watts, and the Party&#x27;s President Alex McKenzie, Holland reluctantly agreed to resign as Prime Minister and Leader of the Party.

On 12 August 1957, Holland announced his retirement at the National Party&#x27;s annual conference in Wellington. Once he had made that announcement, he became so obviously sick that he had to be helped back to his hotel, where a doctor was called. The following day, Holyoake was formally named Holland&#x27;s successor. Holland handed over the Prime Ministry to Holyoake on 20 September. Shortly afterwards, on 23 September, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. He remained in Cabinet, as minister without portfolio; but he left the legislature for good at the 1957 general election, in which Holyoake went down to defeat, and which saw the advent of a second Labour Government under Walter Nash.

==Later life and death==
Following his departure from parliament, Holland suffered continual ill health. He died in Wellington Hospital in 1961. His son Eric Holland became a National MP for Fendalton and Riccarton (1967–81) and a cabinet minister (1975–78) in Robert Muldoon&#x27;s first administration.

<doc id="340381" wikidata="Q1064335" url="?curid=340381" title="Pig War (1859)">
<text>The Pig War was a confrontation in 1859 between the United States and the United Kingdom over the British–U.S. border in the San Juan Islands, between Vancouver Island (present-day Canada) and the Washington Territory (present-day State of Washington). The Pig War, so called because it was triggered by the shooting of a pig, is also called the Pig Episode, the Pig and Potato War, the San Juan Boundary Dispute, and the Northwestern Boundary Dispute. Despite being referred to as a &quot;war&quot;, there were no human casualties on either side.

==Background==

===Border ambiguity===
The Oregon Treaty of June 15, 1846, resolved the Oregon boundary dispute by dividing the Oregon Country/Columbia District between the United States and Britain (future Canada) &quot;along the 49th parallel of north latitude to the middle of the channel which separates the continent from off-shore Vancouver Island, and thence southerly through the middle of the said channel, and of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, to the Pacific Ocean.&quot;

However, two straits could be called the middle of the channel: Haro Strait, along the west side of the off-shore San Juan Islands; and Rosario Strait, along the east side.

In 1846, there was still some uncertainty about the region&#x27;s physical geography. The most commonly available maps were those of Royal Navy Captain George Vancouver (1757–1798), published in 1798, and of the United States Navy&#x27;s Charles Wilkes (1798–1877), published in 1845. In both cases, the maps are unclear in the vicinity of the southeastern coast of Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands. As a result, Haro Strait is not fully clear either.

In 1856, the U.S. and Britain set up a Boundary Commission to resolve several issues regarding the international boundary, including the water boundary from the Strait of Georgia to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The British appointed James Charles Prevost (1810–1891), as First Commissioner, George Henry Richards (1820–1896) as Second Commissioner, and William A. G. Young (1827–1885) as Secretary. The U.S. appointed Archibald Campbell First Commissioner, John Parke (1827–1900), Second Commissioner, and William J. Warren Secretary. On June 27, 1857, the American and British commissioners met for the first time on board the British Royal Navy warship HMS &quot;Satellite&quot;, anchored in Esquimalt Harbour. The two sides met several more times in 1857 in Esquimalt Harbour and Nanaimo Harbour, and corresponded by letter between meetings. The water boundary was discussed from October to December. From the start, Prevost maintained that Rosario Strait was required by the treaty&#x27;s wording and was intended by the treaty framers, while Campbell had the same opinion for Haro Strait. 

Prevost held that the channel specified in the treaty must have three essential qualities:
* it must separate the continent from Vancouver Island
* it must carry the boundary in a southerly direction
* it must be navigable

Only Rosario fulfilled these requirements, he wrote. Campbell countered that the expression &quot;southerly&quot;, in the treaty, was to be understood in a general sense, that Rosario Strait did not separate the continent from Vancouver Island, but the San Juan Islands from Lummi Island, Cypress Island, Fidalgo Island, and others, and that navigability was not germane to the issue, but even if it was, Haro Strait was the wider and more direct passage. Finally, he challenged Prevost to produce any evidence showing that the treaty framers had intended Rosario Strait. Prevost responded to the challenge by referring to American maps showing the boundary running through Rosario Strait, including one by John C. Frémont, produced for and published by the US government, and another by John B. Preston, Surveyor General of Oregon in 1852. To the other points, Prevost repeated his statements about Rosario Strait&#x27;s navigability—the channels between Lummi, Cypress, and Fidalgo islands not being navigable—and that a line through Rosario would be southerly. At the same time, one through Haro would have to be drawn westerly. The two continued to discuss the issue into December 1857, until it was clear what each side&#x27;s argument was and that neither would be convinced of the other. Prevost made a final offer at the sixth meeting, on December 3. He suggested a compromise line through San Juan Channel, which would give the US all the main islands except San Juan Island. This offer was rejected and the commission adjourned, agreeing to report back to their respective governments. Thus ambiguity over the water boundary remained.

Because of this ambiguity, both the United States and Britain claimed sovereignty over the San Juan Islands. During this period of disputed sovereignty, Britain&#x27;s Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established operations on San Juan and turned the island into a sheep ranch. Meanwhile, by mid-1859, twenty-five to twenty-nine American settlers had arrived.

San Juan Island held significance not for its size, but as a military strategic point. While the British held Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island to the west, overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the entry point to Haro Strait, leading to the Strait of Georgia, the nation that held the San Juan Islands would be able to dominate all the straits connecting the Strait of Juan de Fuca with the Strait of Georgia.

===Political context===

Former Union Army General-in-Chief (1861–1862), George B. McClellan (1826–1885), and George Pickett (1825–1875)’s classmate at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and lifelong friend, although military opponent, claimed that General William S. Harney (1800–1889), and Pickett conspired with a cabal, to start a war with Britain (United Kingdom), creating a common enemy, to head off a north–south confrontation. However, General Granville O. Haller (1819–1897), disputed General McClellan&#x27;s later theory. He said they had wanted to start a war, but with hope of distracting the North so that the South could secede from the federal Union.
The theories are given credence when it is noted that later Major General Silas Casey (1807–1882), then a lieutenant colonel and deputy commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment, was reduced to a support role for lower ranked Captain George Pickett who was given independent jurisdiction over a vast area by General William Harney, then a brevet major, and was also passed over by Harney in favor of Captain Pickett when given this choice command.

On the other hand, it can be said that Lieutenant Colonel Casey had not been reduced, for he was given command over the &quot;U.S.S. Massachusetts&quot; and Major Haller to protect and supervise the waters of the Puget Sound. Based on his military experience, he was given discretion to deviate from his orders.

==The pig incident==

On June 15, 1859, exactly 13 years after the adoption of the Oregon Treaty, the ambiguity led to direct conflict. Lyman Cutlar, an American farmer who had moved onto San Juan Island claiming rights to live there under the Donation Land Claim Act, passed nine years earlier by the U.S. Congress in 1850, found a pig rooting in his garden and eating his tubers. This was not the first occurrence and as a result, Cutlar, tired of the intrusion, shot and killed the pig. It turned out that the pig was owned by an Irishman, Charles Griffin, who was employed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to run their sheep ranch on the island. He also owned several pigs that he allowed to roam freely. The two had lived in peace until this incident. Cutlar offered $10 () to Griffin to compensate for the pig, but Griffin was unsatisfied with this offer and demanded $100 (). Following this reply, Cutlar believed he should not have to pay for the pig because the pig had been trespassing on his land. One likely apocryphal account has Cutlar saying to Griffin, &quot;It was eating my potatoes&quot;; and Griffin replying, &quot;It is up to you to keep your potatoes out of my pig.&quot; When British authorities threatened to arrest Cutlar, nearby American settlers called for military protection in the Washington Territory from the United States Army.

==Military escalation==
 Brigadier General William S. Harney (1800–1889), then commanding the military Department of Oregon on the West Coast, initially dispatched then Captain George Pickett (1825–1875), and 66 American soldiers of the 9th Infantry Regiment under Pickett&#x27;s command, to the off-shore San Juan Island with orders to prevent the British from landing; the regiment sailed aboard the wooden-hulled steamer warship . Concerned that a squatter population of Americans would begin to occupy San Juan Island if the Americans were not kept in check, the British on Vancouver Island then sent three Royal Navy warships under the command of Captain Geoffrey Hornby (1825–1895), to counter the perceived Americans&#x27; infringement. Captain Pickett was quoted as saying defiantly, &quot;We&#x27;ll make a Bunker Hill of it,&quot; placing him later in the national limelight reported in the press. Pickett sited his company and battery near the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s Belle Vue sheep farm near today&#x27;s Cattle Point Light, and directly under the guns of &quot;H.M.S. Satellite&quot;, a British warship. When this tactical error was pointed out, Capt. Pickett moved his battery of cannon a few miles north to high ground overlooking both Griffin Bay and the entrance waterway of the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the Puget Sound (and important American new seaport at Seattle in the former Oregon Territory (1848-1853/1859), later split off in the new Washington Territory, 1853–1889), and commenced to build a redoubt for his cannon.

Captain Pickett established the American military camp near the south end of San Juan Island, today one of two historical sites on the island, the other being the British camp, defended by the Royal Marines on the opposite north end of the island. The U.S. camp redoubt was built under the supervision of new United States Military Academy at West Point, New York graduate, then 2nd Lieutenant Henry Martyn Robert (1837–1923); Robert went on to become a general in the Army of the Potomac of the Union Army during the subsequent American Civil War (1861–1865), and author of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;, acclaimed reference manual on democratic parliamentary procedure. Robert&#x27;s Redoubt of 1859 on the island is considered the best-preserved fortification of its kind now in the United States. (To the east is Jackle&#x27;s Lagoon, named for George Jackle, a soldier stationed at the American camp.)

The situation continued to escalate. By August 10, 1859, the enlarged defending detachment of now 461 Americans with 14 cannons under Colonel Silas Casey (1807–1882), were opposed by now also reinforced flotilla of five British Royal Navy warships mounting 70 guns and carrying 2,140 men.

The governor of the off-shore Colony of Vancouver Island, James Douglas (1803–1877), had ordered Captain Hornby to dislodge the American troops, avoiding armed conflict if possible. At the time, the additional reinforcements sent by the American General William Harney had not yet arrived, and the island was occupied by only Capt. Pickett&#x27;s small detachment of 66 men. Hornby refused to take any action until British Rear Admiral Robert L. Baynes (1796–1869), who was in command of the British Royal Navy in the Pacific, would arrive himself and issue commands. When Admiral Baynes finally came later and took stock of the situation, he told Governor Douglas that he would not escalate the conflict into a war between two great nations &quot;over a squabble about a pig&quot;.

==Resolution==
When news about the developing escalating crisis reached the far-away capitals of London and Washington, D.C., officials from both nations were shocked at the potential conflict and took action to calm the potentially explosive international incident.

In September, the 15th U.S. President James Buchanan (1791–1868, served 1857–1861), sent the U.S. Army&#x27;s General-in-Chief Winfield Scott (1786–1866), to negotiate with Governor Douglas and resolve the growing crisis and prevent it from spinning out of control. This was in the best interest of the United States, as sectionalist tensions within the American nation itself were rapidly increasing, soon to culminate in the coming bloody American Civil War of 1861–1865. General Scott had calmed two other earlier border crises between the two nations two decades before in the late 1830s. He arrived in the San Juans in October and began negotiations with Governor Douglas on Vancouver Island.

As a result of the negotiations, both sides agreed to retain joint military occupation of the island until a final negotiated diplomatic settlement could be reached, reducing their presence to a token force of no more than 100 men. The British camp was established on the north end of San Juan Island along the shoreline, for ease of resupply and access; and the American camp was created on the south end on a high, windswept meadow, suitable for artillery barrages against passing shipping in the strait. Today the Union Jack flag still flies above the former British Royal Marines camp site, being raised and lowered daily by American National Park Service rangers, making it one of the few places without diplomatic status where U.S. federal government employees regularly hoist the flag of another country, though this is only for commemorative historical and nostalgic purposes.

During the following years of joint military occupation, the small British and American units on San Juan Island had an amicable mutual social life, visiting one another&#x27;s camps to celebrate their respective national holidays and holding various athletic competitions. N.P.S. park rangers tell visitors the biggest threat to peace on the island during these years of the 1850s and 1860s was &quot;the large amounts of alcohol available&quot;.

This state of affairs continued for the next 12 years. The dispute was peacefully resolved after the initial skirmish of more than a decade of confrontation and military bluster, during which time local British mainland authorities lobbied London to seize back the off-shore islands of the Puget Sound region while the Americans were busy elsewhere with the their own Civil War. 
In 1866, the Colony of Vancouver Island was merged with the short-lived Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866) on the mainland of western North America to form a second enlarged Colony of British Columbia of 1866–1871. 

In 1871, the enlarged colony on the West Coast joined the newly-formed confederation of 1867 further east on the continent of the new Dominion of Canada. That year, the United Kingdom and the United States also signed the Treaty of Washington of 1871, which dealt with various remaining minor differences between the two nations, including border issues involving the newly formed self-governing dominion of the British Empire. Among the results of the treaty was the decision to resolve the San Juan Island dispute by international arbitration, under the good offices of mediation offered by the newly-crowned German Emperor (Kaiser) Wilhelm I (1797–1888, reigned as King of Prussia since 1861, then as Emperor 1871–1888), chosen to act as arbitrator, meaning that the recently unified German Empire of 1871–1918 (in Germany) would decide if the British or the Americans would officially own the San Juan Islands off the west coast of North America. Presenting for the United States in the subsequent San Juan arbitration case was the prominent American historian and diplomat (minister / ambassador) and notable former U.S. Secretary of the Navy, of George Bancroft (1800–1891), who displayed great versatility and skill and won the case. 
German Kaiser Wilhelm I referred the issue to a three-man arbitration commission which met in Geneva, of neutral Switzerland for nearly a year. 
Finally on October 21, 1872, the commission decided in favor of the United States&#x27; offer. The arbitrators chose the American-preferred marine boundary via the waterway of the Haro Strait, to the west of the islands, over the British preference for using the Rosario Strait which lay to their east to demarcate the border extension.

On November 25, 1872, the British withdrew their Royal Marines from the British camp. The Americans followed by July 1874.

The Pig War is commemorated in San Juan Island National Historical Park.

<doc id="340384" wikidata="Q1382889" url="?curid=340384" title="Johnny Hart">
<text>John Lewis Hart (February 18, 1931 – April 7, 2007) was an American cartoonist noted as the creator of the comic strips &quot;B.C.&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot;. Brant Parker co-produced and illustrated &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot;. Hart was recognized with several awards, including the Swedish Adamson Award and five from the National Cartoonists Society. In his later years, he was known (and sometimes criticized) for incorporating Christian themes and messages into his strips. Hart was referred to by Chuck Colson in a &quot;Breakpoint&quot; column as &quot;the most widely read Christian of our time,&quot; over C. S. Lewis, Frank E. Peretti, and Billy Graham.

==Biography==
Born in Endicott, New York, Hart published his first work in &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; while he served in Korea as an enlisted member of the United States Air Force. Returning in 1953, he published cartoons in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and other magazines. His pre-cartooning employment included working in a barbecue restaurant and sign painting. Hart&#x27;s biggest success, &quot;B.C.&quot;, was created in 1957 and began appearing in national daily newspapers on February 17, 1958. Hart also co-created and wrote the comic strip &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot;, drawn by Brant Parker, which has been distributed since November 9, 1964.

According to Hanna-Barbera animator Ed Benedict, the animation powerhouses approached Hart in 1960 pitching a prime time animated B.C. series. Talks fell through with HB retooling the concept into what eventually became The Flintstones.

Hart died of a stroke on April 7, 2007. According to his wife Bobby, he was working at his drawing table at the time of his death. His co-creator for &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot;, Brant Parker, died just eight days later, on April 15, 2007.

===Religious convictions===

Hart was raised in a casually religious family, and he attended Christian Sunday School regularly. Although his formal education ended with high school, he was fascinated by the Bible from a young age.
In 1984 there was a distinguishable shift in Hart&#x27;s spirituality, and Hart and wife Bobby began attending a congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Nineveh, New York. Hart attributed his religious awakening to a father-son team of contractors who installed a satellite dish at his home. 
Hart&#x27;s increasingly deep religious faith, and the staunch theological and political conservatism that accompanied it, came to be the source of considerable controversy in the later years of his life. In a 1999 interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, for example, he stated that &quot;Jews and Muslims who don&#x27;t accept Jesus will burn in Hell&quot; and that &quot;homosexuality is the handiwork of Satan.&quot; In the same piece, Hart opined that &quot;the end of the world is approaching, maybe by the year 2010.&quot;
The lion&#x27;s share of controversy, however, came from Hart&#x27;s increasing tendency to incorporate his religious and political themes and ideals into his comic strips, especially &quot;B.C.&quot; Some newspapers refused to print strips with overtly religious themes or, as with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, moved them to the religious section of the newspaper.

===Controversial strips===
Two strips in particular were controversial. The &quot;B.C.&quot; strip for April 15, 2001, which was Easter Sunday, portrayed a Jewish menorah with seven candles progressively burning out as the strip captions ran the words of Jesus Christ. At the end, the outer arms of the candelabrum broke away, leaving a Christian cross, with the final panel portraying the opened and empty tomb of Christ. Critics including the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee argued that Hart&#x27;s strip portrayed replacement theology, that is, the conception of Christianity as supplanting Judaism. Hart offered an apology &quot;if I have offended any readers,&quot; but still thought the strip could increase &quot;religious awareness&quot; and claimed that he had meant the strip to be a tribute to both religions.

Another &quot;B.C.&quot; strip, which ran November 10, 2003, showed an outhouse with a traditional crescent, which a character entered with a vertical graphic &quot;SLAM&quot;, only to ask, &quot;Is it just me, or does it stink in here?&quot; Critics including the Council on American-Islamic Relations claimed that the combination of the vertical bar and the &quot;SLAM&quot;, as well as the crescent moons both in the sky and on the outhouse, made the strip a slur on Islam. Hart denied that it was anything but an outhouse joke.

==Personal life==
Hart was an active member of his local community — the area of Greater Binghamton in Broome County, New York, which shares a common abbreviation of &quot;B.C.&quot; Hart donated B.C.-based drawings and logos free of charge to many entities and organizations found in the Broome County area, including logos for:
* B.C. Transit — Caveman on Wheel
* Broome County Parks — Dinosaur
* Broome County Meals on Wheels — Caveman on Wheel with Food
* Southern Tier Red Cross — Caveman building Red Cross with Bricks
* Broome County Celtic Pipes and Drums — Caveman wearing Kilt and playing Bagpipes
* Broome County Celtic Kazoos — Irish Caveman with Kazoo
* B.C. Open PGA Tour Event (1971–2006) — Caveman golfing
* Broome Dusters NAHL Hockey Club — Caveman with hockey stick
* B.C. Icemen UHL Hockey Club — Brute Cavemen playing hockey
* Southern Tier Independence Center — Caveman in stone wheelchair stuck in cave doorway, &quot;Wiley&quot; character navigating a landscape full of holes
Hart&#x27;s involvement with the B.C. Open dated back to the early 1970s, and characters from &quot;B.C.&quot; were used extensively in advertising and marketing materials for the event, including the winner&#x27;s trophy, which was a bronzed version of a hapless &quot;B.C.&quot; Caveman golfing, a light-hearted trophy when compared to many others, leading it to have earned the designation of being &quot;voted by the players on Tour as the best trophy on Tour; the one that they would love to have.&quot;

Additionally, Hart contributed original panels of &quot;B.C.&quot; strips for charity auctions with the Binghamton, New York-based PBS affiliate, WSKG-TV. He also provided album cover art for the 1999 album &quot;Still Fresh&quot; by the world-famous jazz vocal group The Four Freshmen, and his strips for B.C. were the inspiration for the mascot of UC Irvine, the anteater.

==Tribute==

Hart was memorialized in a May 14, 2007, strip of the comic strip &quot;Mother Goose &amp; Grimm&quot;. In the June 20, 2007, &quot;Blondie&quot; strip, the last panel shows Mr. Dithers saying, &quot;Boy oh boy, that Johnny Hart sure knew his stuff, didn&#x27;t he?&quot; Bruce Tinsley honored Hart in his &quot;Mallard Fillmore&quot; strip of July 10, 2007.
There was also a tribute in &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot; strip. In the February 14, 2008, strip, two peasant women are talking. One who has just bought some flowers says: &quot;How come you don&#x27;t celebrate Valentine&#x27;s Day?&quot; and the other answers: &quot;My Hart isn&#x27;t in it this year.&quot;

===Mastroianni Poems===

Traditionally, every December 3, Johnny Hart would draw a &quot;B.C.&quot; cartoon with his wife Ida &quot;Bobby&quot; Hart portrayed as the queen of the ant colony, to celebrate her birthday. On December 3, 2007, his grandson Mason Mastroianni carried on the tradition, a practice he would keep up yearly until 2019, the year after Bobby Hart&#x27;s death.

===grOnk===

In January 1967, the Candian writer bpNichol edited and published the first issue of the avantgarde literary magazine &quot;grOnk&quot;, named after the prelinguistic sound uttered by dinosaurs in Hart&#x27;s &quot;B.C.&quot;. &quot;grOnk&quot; ran for at least 122 issues in various series until the time of Nichol&#x27;s death in 1988, with a further 7 &quot;Inadmissible Series&quot; issues published posthumously.

==Awards==
With the release of &quot;Wizard of Id&quot; in 1964, Hart became one of only four cartoonists to have two comic strips appearing in over 1000 papers each. He won numerous awards for his work, including the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Reuben award for &quot;B.C.&quot; in 1968 and &quot;Wizard of Id&quot; in 1984.

<text>Ah, L&#x27;Amour (1995, ) is Don Hertzfeldt&#x27;s first 16mm student animated short film, completed at the age of 18 at UC Santa Barbara. Though produced for a beginning film class and never meant to be exhibited, the short had a long life at animation festivals, launching Hertzfeldt into cult status at a young age. In 1998, the short won the Grand Prize Award for &quot;World&#x27;s Funniest Cartoon&quot; from the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival.

The cartoon is a satire of toxic men. In it, a pickup artist is violently torn apart by the women he targets, viewed only through his own one-sided, ridiculously misogynistic point of view. Hertzfeldt plays the part of a mentally unwell animator who&#x27;s losing his grip on his sanity while animating, an idea he&#x27;d later revisit in other early &quot;meta&quot; shorts &quot;Genre&quot; and &quot;Rejected&quot;.

The soundtrack is acoustic guitar music, performed by Hertzfeldt on a boom box in his dorm room.

== Release ==

In the 1990s, the cartoon screened nationwide in theaters as part of the Spike and Mike&#x27;s Festival of Animation tour.

In 2005, the original 16mm negative was digitally restored and remastered for release on the extensive &quot;Bitter Films Volume 1&quot; DVD compilation of Hertzfeldt&#x27;s 1995-2005 films. For the DVD, Hertzfeldt performed an alternate guitar soundtrack as a special feature, approximately 10 years after recording the original. Other special features for &quot;Ah L&#x27;Amour&quot; include Don&#x27;s original production sketches and notes, as well as a very rare 1993 video short that Don created in high school that is a precursor to the film.

<doc id="340390" wikidata="Q131440608" url="?curid=340390" title="Freemartin">
<text>A freemartin or free-martin (sometimes martin heifer) is an infertile cow with masculinized behavior and non-functioning ovaries. Phenotypically, the animal appears female, but various aspects of female reproductive development are altered due to acquisition of anti-Müllerian hormone from the male twin. Genetically, the animal is chimeric: karyotypy of a sample of cells shows XX/XY chromosomes. The animal originates as a female (XX), but acquires the male (XY) component in utero by exchange of some cellular material from a male twin, via vascular connections between placentas: an example of microchimerism. The chimerism is mainly present in the hematopoietic stem cells.

== History ==

Freemartins are known to have been described by the Roman writer Varro, who called them .

The 18th century physician John Hunter discovered that a freemartin always has a male twin.

It was hypothesized early in the 20th century that masculinizing factors travel from the male twin to the female twin through the vascular connections of the placenta because of the vascular fusion and affect the internal anatomy of the female.

Several researchers made the discovery that a freemartin results when a female fetus has its chorion fuse in the uterus with that of a male twin. The result was published in 1916 by Tandler and Keller. The discovery was made independently by American biologist Frank R. Lillie, who published it in &quot;Science&quot; in 1916. Both teams are now credited with the discovery.

In rural areas folklore often claimed this condition was not just peculiar to cattle, but extended also to human twins. This belief perpetuated for generations, as was mentioned in the writings of Cuthbert Bede.

===Etymology===
The etymology of the term &quot;freemartin&quot; is uncertain: speculations include that &quot;free&quot; may indicate &quot;willing&quot; (referring to the freemartin&#x27;s willingness to work) or &quot;exempt from reproduction&quot; (referring to its sterility, or to a farmer&#x27;s decision to not bother trying to breed a freemartin, or both), or that it may be derived from a Flemish word for a cow which gives no milk and/or has ceased to be capable of bearing offspring; &quot;martin&quot; is generally held to derive from an Irish or Gaelic word for &quot;cow&quot; or &quot;heifer&quot;, although connections to Martinmas have also been posited.

==Mechanism==
In most cattle twins, the blood vessels in the chorions become interconnected, creating a shared circulation for both twins. If both fetuses are the same sex this is of no significance, but if they are different, male cells pass from the male twin to the female twin, where they produce hormones (testosterone and anti-Müllerian hormone) that masculinize the female twin, and the result is a freemartin. The degree of masculinization is greater if the fusion occurs earlier in the pregnancy – in about ten percent of cases no fusion takes place and the female remains fertile.

The male twin is largely unaffected by the fusion, although the size of the testicles may be slightly reduced. Testicle size is associated with fertility, so there may be some reduction in bull fertility.

Freemartins behave and grow in a similar way to castrated male cattle (steers).

==Diagnosis==
If suspected, a test can be done to detect the presence of the male Y-chromosomes in some circulating white blood cells of the subject. Genetic testing for the Y-chromosome can be performed within days of birth and can aid in the early identification of a sterile female bovine.

Physical examination of the calf may also reveal differences: a subjective assessment is that frequently there is a lengthened tuft of hair at the ventral tip of the vulva in a freemartin heifer atypical in fertile heifer calves. Also, often many (but not all) freemartins will have a shortened length of vagina compared with that of a fertile heifer. Commercial probes are available to check heifers for obvious freemartinism in lieu of doing a blood test 

==Other animals==
A freemartin is the normal outcome of mixed twins in all cattle species which have been studied. It is most frequent in cattle and does not normally occur in most other mammals, though it has been recorded in sheep, goats, and pigs.

==Uses==
Freemartins are occasionally used in stem cell and immunology research. 
During fetal development cells are exchanged between the fused circulations of the bovine twins. Up to 95% of the freemartin&#x27;s blood cells can be derived from those of her twin brother. Male-derived cells and their progeny can be easily visualised in the freemartin tissues, as only they contain the male Y chromosome. Thus, by analysing these tissues, one can investigate the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells or other circulating cells to produce other tissues in addition to blood. The freemartin model allows one to analyse perfectly healthy and unmanipulated animals, without resorting to transplantation often used in stem cell research.

==Fictional use==
* In the Aldous Huxley novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;, a &quot;freemartin&quot; (mentioned in chapters 1, 3, 11 and 17) is a woman who has been deliberately made sterile by exposure to hormones during fetal development; in the book, government policy requires freemartins to constitute 70% of the female population. A side effect of this is some freemartin women having developed beards.
* The Robert A. Heinlein novel &quot;Beyond This Horizon&quot; lists &quot;the clever and repulsively beautiful pseudo-feminine freemartins&quot; as one of the genetically-engineered specialist types of humans that were created in the &quot;Empire of the Great Khans&quot; (chapter 2).
*In the Robert Heinlein novel &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot;, the protagonist, Hugh Farnham, is given a companion (&quot;bedwarmer&quot;) that is described as a &quot;natural freemartin&quot;.
*In the Avram Davidson story &quot;The House the Blakeneys Built&quot;, the cattle are freemartins.
*In the fantasy book series &quot;Bazil Broketail&quot; by Christopher Rowley, &quot;freemartin&quot; is the name for a breed of sterile female dragons.
*In &quot;Footfall&quot; by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, a lithely-built human woman uses the term &quot;freemartin&quot; to describe herself, while doubting her sexuality.
*In Nicola Griffith&#x27;s novel &quot;Hild&quot;, the title character is sometimes referred to by others as a freemartin, in reference to her non-feminine character and social role.
* In Lauren Groff&#x27;s novel &quot;Matrix&quot; (New York: Riverhead Books, 2021), 12th-century English peasants use freemartins to pull wagons.

<text>Zhejiang University (ZJU) is a public research university in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education. The university is part of the C9 League, Double First-Class Construction, Project 985, and Project 211.

The university traces its root to Qiushi Academy, a college preparatory school founded in 1897 and closed in 1914. The university was established as National Third Chung Shan University in 1927, in memory of Sun Yat-sen, and soon renamed as National Chekiang University (NCKU) in 1928. During the presidency of Chu Kochen from 1936 to 1949, the university retreated to Guizhou in Western China during the Second Sino-Japanese War, before it moved back to Hangzhou in 1946. 

After the Communist Revolution, the university was re-organized as an engineering-specialized university in 1952. In 1998, Zhejiang Medical University, Hangzhou University and Zhejiang Agricultural University, which were derived from former departments of Chekiang University, merged and formed the present-day ZJU as a comprehensive university.

The university maintains 7 faculties with 37 colleges and schools, offering about 140 undergraduate and 300 graduate programs. The university also has seven affiliated hospitals, 1 museum, 2 international joint institutes. 52 members of ZJU faculty are the members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering.

==History==
=== 1897–1914: college-preparatory school ===
Established in 1897 by Hangzhou&#x27;s mayor, Lin Qi, Qiushi Academy was the major predecessor to the university. The educational reforms of 1902 and 1904 in China led to the academy being renamed Chekiang University in 1902, and subsequently Chekiang Higher Institute in 1903. Elmer L. Mattox of Hangchow Presbyterian College was appointed as the head teacher of the college, responsible for supervising and organising teaching. The Institute was the first provincial educational institution to send students to study abroad. However, the proposed reforms under the new republican government following the 1911 revolution sparked controversy, causing the Institutes to cease student recruitment in 1912 and ultimately close in 1914. 

In 1947, Chang Ch&#x27;i-yun, a professor at NCKU, began attributing the university&#x27;s origin to the Qiushi Academy, which was later acknowledge in the yearbook of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China.

=== 1928–1949: national university ===
After the closure of Cheking Higher Institute, the attempts to restore the institute was unsuccessful due to conflicts between warlords. After the Northern Expedition in July 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT) took control of Hangzhou and established the National Third Chungshan University, by merging Chekiang Industrial College and Chekiang Agricultural College on the original site of Qiushi Academy. On 1 April 1928, the institution was renamed Chekiang University, and later that year it was renamed National Chekiang University (NCKU), with Jiang Menglin, an alumnus and teacher of Qiushi, as its first president. 

In 1929, Jiang was succeeded by Shao Peizi, also an alumnus and teacher of Qiushi. Shao refused to join KMT, which led to a tense relationship between the university and the government, and the government withdrew funding in 1932, leading to Shao&#x27;s resignation. Cheng Tien-fong, a member of the KMT, was then appointed by the Nationalist government as the new president. Under his leadership, with the personal intervention of Chiang Kai-shek, the university began to receive direct funding from the central government. 

In March 1933, Kuo Zing-Yang, another KMT member, became president. But as the Sino-Japanese conflict intensified and the Nationalist government&#x27;s response to the invasion was perceived as lenient, its popularity waned. This discontent culminated in the December 9 Movement of 1935, when students ousted Kuo from office, accusing him of collaborating with the police to arrest student demonstrators.Chu Kochen, a scholar with no previous political appointments, was recommended to Chiang Kai-shek by Chen Bulei for the presidency of NCKU in April 1936. Kochen&#x27;s inauguration was presided over by Jiang Menglin. Backed by Chen Bulei&#x27;s strong financial backing and authority to make political appointments within the university, Chu was able to attract leading members of the Science Society of China and the &quot;Critical Review&quot; Group. In the second half of 1937, with the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the advance of the Japanese army, the university was forced to move from Hangzhou, first to Yishan, then to Zunyi, and finally to Meitan in Guizhou Province in southwest China. During this period, the students of NCKU took on the responsibility of safeguarding Zhejiang&#x27;s historical collections, including the &quot;Complete Library of the Four Treasuries&quot; housed in the Wenlan Pavilion, to prevent their capture by Japanese forces.

In March 1945, Fei Gong, an NCKU professor and critic of the Nationalist government, disappeared in Chongqing in what was later proved to be a government assassination. In September, with the surrender of Japan, a group of NCKU professors led by Luo Zongluo were ordered by the government to take over the Japanese Imperial University in Taiwan. In October, the students and faculty who had retreated to Longquan began to return to Hangzhou, while those who had retreated to Guizhou returned in May 1946 with the help of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The university set up its first medical school on the instructions of the Ministry of Education.

In late 1947, the death of Yu Zisan, the president of the university&#x27;s student union, led to strikes and protests. While Chu attempted to strike a balance between his students and the Nationalist government, his relationship with the students worsened and he moved to Shanghai, upon the request of the Nationalist government. But he eventually did not move to Taiwan and secretly stayed at the Academia Sinica building in Shanghai, until the Communist takeover of the NCKU campus in May 1949.

=== 1949–1976: Mao Zedong era ===
In August 1948, Ma Yinchu was appointed as the university president, who promoted communist education and organisations within the university. In 1950, the new Ministry of Education instructed all universities to remove &quot;National&quot; from their names. Hence the university&#x27;s name was changed to its present name in Chinese, or Zhejiang University (ZJU). The communist education among faculty evolved into the Thought Reform and Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns after Ma was appointed the president of Peking University in 1949. ZJU scholars such as Su Buqing, Tan Jiazhen, Wang Guosong became targets of political prosecution.

In the early 1950s, the university underwent a series of re-organisation, which aimed to establish a Soviet-styled education system, to eventually became an engineering-focused university., which only had the departments of electrical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering and mechanical engineering. The engineering school of Hangchow University merged into ZJU. The university&#x27;s College of Agriculture became an independent university, named Zhejiang Agricultural University. The university&#x27;s medical school merged into Zhejiang Provincial Medical College to become Zhejiang Medical College. The departments of Chinese Literature, Foreign Literature and Education was merged into Zhejiang Teachers College and relocated to the campus of Hangchow University. The faculty of College of Sciences were sent to Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In 1954, the university moved from Daxue Road to Yuquan. Liu Dan, the university&#x27;s Party Secretary, restored sciences research and education as part of the university&#x27;s engineering offerings. In 1963, ZJU was selected as one of the National Key Universities.In 1966, the Cultural Revolution broke out and the university ceased to function. Liu Dan was removed from office after being attacked by the Zhejiang Daily and the People&#x27;s Daily. There was an emergence of radical groups in favour of Cultural Revolution.&quot;&quot; In August, the ZJU students confronted with younger red guards, who were mostly high school students, to protect Lingyin Temple from their attempts to destroy Four Olds. In 1967, at a meeting with Tan Zhenlin in Beijing, red guards from ZJU were told that Mao Zedong wanted to protect Jiang Hua in this revolution. This led to a split within red guards in Zhejiang, particularly with another faction led by Zhang Yongsheng from the Chinese Academy of Art, who wanted to persecute Jiang Hua. The two factions fought each other constantly throughout the Cultural Revolution.

=== 1976 to present ===
With the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Liu returned to ZJU as the honorary president, the only by far. In November 1980, ZJU became co-funded by both Ministry of Education and Zhejiang&#x27;s provincial government. 

In 1989, Zhejiang University students, along with more than 10 other universities in Hangzhou, demonstrated in Wulin Square in support of the democracy movement in Beijing. After hearing of the massacre in Beijing, the student protesters blocked the railway at Nanxingqiao station with their bodies for three days before negotiating with the vice-governor, Chai Songyue. At least 60 passenger trains and 166 freight trains were blocked during the protest.

Since 1988 to 1995, Lu Yongxiang assumed the president of Zhejiang University, during which he made &quot;pursuing innovation&quot; part of the university motto and reformed teaching and research systems, including introduction of the program of Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education.

In 1995, it was selected into Project 211. In 1997, Wang Ganchang and Bei Shizhang in Beijing, and Su Buqing and Tan Jiazhen in Shanghai, wrote a joint letter to the then General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiang Zemin, recommending a merger of the four universities. In 1998, with the approval of the State Council, the new Zhejiang University was established as a merger of four major universities. With over 30,000 students and 10,000 staff, the new Zhejiang University was considered the largest higher education institution in Asia. Zhang Junsheng was appointed Party secretary of the university to oversee the merger. In 2005, the university founded Zhejiang University Holding Group, later renamed as Zhejiang University Yuanzheng Holding Group. As of 2022, there are several companies affiliated to the group have been publicly listed, including Insigma Technology, United Mechanical &amp; Electrical, and Shenghua Land. In October 2005, the university&#x27;s Hubin campus was sold at the price of 2.46 billion Chinese yuan to Kerry Properties for commercial complex development. In June 2012, Zhejiang University founded the Ocean College in collaboration with Zhoushan municipal government. In December 2014, the university signed an agreement with the University of Edinburgh to form a joint institute at the Haining campus. In July 2015, another agreement to build a joint institute was signed with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In September 2016, the new Haining campus came into use.

In April 2013, 53 alumni co-signed a petition against the appointment of Lin Jianhua as Zhejiang University&#x27;s new president. An open letter by the alumni says, &quot;Zhejiang University needs an upright and capable academic leader, not a mediocre chief executive.&quot; In November 2013, Chu Jian, vice president of the university who was rumoured to be behind the rare petition, was arrested for bribery, yet he was not tried until 2017 and was soon released after he was sentenced to 3 years in jail which had almost been fulfilled by the time of trial. 

In September 2013, amid extensive objection from local residents and university alumni, part of Huajiachi campus was sold at the price of 13.67 billion Chinese yuan, making the land the most expensive in the city&#x27;s history. 

In July 2020, the university came under intense criticism for allowing an ethnic minority student convicted of rape to remain enrolled. The public questioned whether the university&#x27;s decision was too lenient for sexual harassments. The overwhelming public opinions made the university review the case, and eventually expelled the student.

In November 2020, the university founded its new Ningbo campus. In 2019, the Institute of Hainan were founded in Sanya, Hainan. In 2021, new institutes were founded in Quzhou, Jinhua, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing and Taizhou within Zhejiang. In March 2021, tech tycoon Colin Huang donated $100 million to support the university&#x27;s Shanghai Institute for Advanced Study.

== Campuses ==
=== Current campuses ===

<text>In social science and economics, public interest is &quot;the welfare or well-being of the general public&quot; and society. While it has earlier philosophical roots and is considered to be at the core of democratic theories of government, often paired with two other concepts, convenience and necessity, it first became explicitly integrated into governance instruments in the early part of the 20th century. The public interest was rapidly adopted and popularised by human rights lawyers in the 1960s and has since been incorporated into other fields such as journalism and technology.

==Overview==
Economist Lok Sang Ho, in his &quot;Public Policy and the Public Interest&quot;, argues that the public interest must be assessed impartially and, therefore, defines the public interest as the &quot;&quot;ex ante&quot; welfare of the representative individual&quot;. Under a thought experiment, by assuming that there is an equal chance for one to be anyone in society and, thus, could benefit or suffer from a change, the public interest is by definition enhanced whenever that change is preferred to the status quo &quot;ex ante&quot;. This approach is &quot;ex ante&quot;, in the sense that the change is not evaluated after the fact but assessed before the fact without knowing whether one would actually benefit or suffer from it.

This approach follows the &quot;veil of ignorance&quot; approach, which was first proposed by John Harsanyi but popularized by John Rawls in his 1971 &quot;Theory of Justice&quot;. Historically, however, the approach can be traced to John Stuart Mill, who, in his letter to George Grote, explained that &quot;human happiness, even one&#x27;s own, is in general more successfully pursued by acting on general rules, than by measuring the consequences of each act; and this is still more the case with the general happiness, since any other plan would not only leave everybody uncertain what to expect, but would involve perpetual quarrelling...&quot;

This approach is attractive because only under impartiality can there be the possibility of consensus. This of course is still conditional: i.e., conditional on everybody doing the same thought experiment as Rawls suggested. Other than this, if everybody considers his own private interests from his point of view, then social welfare will have to be defined in an &quot;ex post&quot; fashion by summing up or otherwise defined over individually rated welfares or social states that would come about because of different social choices. This is the approach of social welfare functions. Whether these functions are based on individually ranked social states or individual cardinal uitilities, the absence of consensus over social welfare functions is unavoidable. 

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales argues that applying a detailed definition is likely to result in unintended consequences, in Acting in the Public Interest(2012). Instead, each circumstance needs to be assessed based on criteria such as the relevant public, wants, and constraints. The key to assessing any public interest decision is transparency of the decision-making process, including balancing competing interests. 

The need to consider the circumstances carefully in all dimensions is well taken, as is the need for transparency of the standards and procedures for policy making. It needs to be noted that in practice adversarial politics means that &quot;balancing competing interests&quot; amounts to politicians navigating through the web of divergent interests to procure their best political interests. The outcome will be a contest of political clout among different competing interests. Whether this promotes the public interest remains controversial.

==Governments==
===US===
Public interest has been considered as the core of &quot;democratic theories of government” and often paired with two other concepts, &quot;convenience&quot; and &quot;necessity&quot;. in the United States, public interest, convenience and necessity appeared for the first time in the Transportation Act of 1920 and also appeared in the Radio Act of 1927. After that, these three concepts became critical criteria for making communication policies and solving some related disputes.

===India===
Indian constitution invokes the term &quot;public interest&quot; at nine places in its Articles 22 (6), 31A (b) and 31A (c) of of people, , , Entries 52, 54 and 56 of union list and Entry 33 of the concurrent list. says the revenues of the Union or a State may be spent for public purposes. When a scheme or project is taken up under public interest by the Union instead of a State, such scheme should be a popular demand of the nationwide public without any opposition from the directly affected stakeholders before the implementation of such scheme. Otherwise, it becomes a public purpose scheme that would serve greater part of society but some would suffer from the implementation of such scheme. In the absence of interpretation (Dos and don&#x27;ts) of the term &quot;public interest&quot; by the courts in India, these Articles are being misused by the union lawmakers to usurp the constitutional powers of the state governments and the rights of people in contrast to the meaning of &quot;public interest&quot;. To legally establish a scheme or project to be taken under public interest or national interest, the proposal can be passed by the Rajya Sabha with a two-thirds majority in its favor per .

== Public interest and public interest-related activities in other academic fields ==
A number of academic fields engage in activities that are connected to and support the goals of the public interest.

=== Engineering ===
Public interest engineering is centered around the development of human and environmentally sustainable structures and system. Public interest design focuses on collaborative efforts to incorporate the public good in designing products, structures, and systems. The Code of Ethics for Engineers from the National Society of Professional Engineers states &quot;Engineers shall at all times strive to serve the public interest.&quot;

=== Government ===
e-Government (also known as digital government or open government) is the use of digital technologies to provide important governmental services to people and communities. The U.S. federal government has multiple initiatives involving using technology to support public interest and improved government. The United States Digital Service offers technology support to agencies of the federal government. The U.S. Digital Corps offers internships designed to help build a federal government workforce skilled in using technology to address local, state, national, and global needs. TechCongress places individuals with technology skills and backgrounds as technology policy advisers to Members of Congress. The 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act, passed in 2018, aims to improve how the public interacts with information on federal government websites. Open government resources are available from the federal government&#x27;s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the Office of Inspector General.

=== History ===
Public history is an area in the field of history where professional and non-professional researchers seek to provide historical information to people and communities. Technology provides public historians with multiple ways to conduct and share their research. The New England Journal of History, an online publication housed at Dean College in Franklin, Massachusetts, has an entire section designed to publish the work of community members who use video cameras to record history in their backyards.

=== Journalism ===
Public interest journalism involves researching and reporting on issues of interest and relevance to people and communities. According to the Charitable Journalism Project, it is &quot;journalism that serves the interests of the public.&quot; The Public Interest Journalism Initiative, established in Melbourne, Australia and in partnership with the University of Melbourne, is a news and public policy organization.

In 2023, The Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University, in partnership with the Rita Allen Foundation announced plans to fund cross-field civic science journalism collaborations intended to build awareness of civic science issues and potential solutions.

Public interest journalism is not present as a concept in all societies, but is growing in use - though between societies where the term is used, definitions vary.

===Law===
Public interest law is rooted in the commitment that members of the legal profession have to being an advocate for all members of society, especially those who lack the financial resources to advocate for themselves in the legal and justice system. Free legal aid for those who cannot afford representation is a well-known form of public interest law in the United States. Prior to the existence of public interest law, the legal needs and advocacy for disadvantaged or vulnerable populations could only be served only through legal aid organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)&#x27;s Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF). The efforts of philanthropic entities like the Ford Foundation facilitated the development of field-building publications, the establishment of public interest law organizations and support for educational and professional development opportunities. The impact of these efforts led to the legal aid clinic programs at Harvard University led by law professor Jeanne Charn and at UC Berkeley School of Law legal clinics led by law professor Jeffrey Selbin as well as the founding of the Council on Legal Education for Professional Responsibility.

=== Science ===
Citizen science involves efforts by everyday, non-professional community members to contribute to and support the development of scientific information in a variety of fields. Eclipse Soundscapes, a NASA-funded citizen science project, is designed to involve non-scientists in the study of how eclipses affect people and environments. Another example of citizen science that involves using technology for the public interest: the Great Backyard Bird Count initiative, which was started in 1998, encourages volunteers to observe birds in their communities and log their findings into the eBird database, begins its 25th year today. Around 385,000 people from 192 countries participated in the four-day program in 2022, and the data is used by researchers to track bird species and direct conservation efforts.

=== Technology ===
Public interest technology (PIT) shares origins with the field of science, technology, and society (STS), which according to Stanford University, started before World War II and was formalized in the 1980s and combines history, anthropology, sociology, economics, ethics, and other approaches to the relations between social contexts and the practices of science and engineering. Much like STS, public interest technology uses an interdisciplinary frame to posit questions about tech designed in service of the public interest emphasizing the importance of co-design and community engagement. The evolution of STS into public interest technology was in part due to what was parceived as still insufficient public engagement during the STS era, as evidenced in, for example, codes of ethics. PIT promotes &quot;the development and realization of socially responsible solutions to the challenges in a technology-driven world.&quot; It has been characterized as people-centered problem solving. PIT emerged as a field of academic research and action in higher education in 2019 with the establishment of the Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN) by New America.

<text>The American Colonies Act 1766 (6 Geo. 3. c. 12), commonly known as the Declaratory Act, was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain which accompanied the repeal of the Stamp Act 1765 and the amendment of the Sugar Act. Parliament repealed the Stamp Act because boycotts were hurting British trade and used the declaration to justify the repeal and avoid humiliation. The declaration stated that the Parliament&#x27;s authority was the same in America as in Britain and asserted Parliament&#x27;s authority to pass laws that were binding on the American colonies.

==Background==
Representatives from a number of the Thirteen Colonies assembled as the Stamp Act Congress in response to the Stamp Act 1765, to call into question the right of a distant power to tax them without proper representation. The British Parliament was then faced with colonies who refused to comply with their Act. This, combined with protests that had occurred in the colonies and, more importantly, protests which had arisen in Great Britain from manufacturers who were suffering from the colonies&#x27; non-importation agreement, all led to the repeal of the Stamp Act. Normally the economic activity in the colonies would not have caused such an outcry, but the British economy was still experiencing a post-war depression from the Seven Years&#x27; War. Another reason for repeal of the Stamp Act was the replacement of George Grenville, the Prime Minister who had enacted the Stamp Acts, by Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham. Rockingham was more favourable towards the colonies and furthermore he was antagonistic towards policies that Grenville had enacted. Rockingham invited Benjamin Franklin to speak to Parliament about colonial policy and he portrayed the colonists as in opposition to internal taxes (which were derived from internal colonial transactions) such as the Stamp Act called for, but not external taxes (which were duties laid on imported commodities). Parliament then agreed to repeal the Stamp Act on the condition that the Declaratory Act was passed. On March 18, 1766, Parliament repealed the Stamp Act and passed the Declaratory Act.

==Reaction==
Although many in Parliament felt that taxes were implied in this clause, other members of Parliament and many of the colonists—who were busy celebrating what they saw as their political victory—did not. Other colonists, however, were outraged because the Declaratory Act hinted that more acts would be coming. This Declaratory Act was copied almost word for word from the Irish Declaratory Act, an Act which had placed Ireland in a position of bondage to the Crown, implying that the same fate would come to The Thirteen Colonies. However, the colonists never explicitly called for its repeal, and would seek reconciliation with the Crown up until the last minute.

The political theorist Edward Mims described the American reaction to the Declaratory Act:

==Legacy==
Following the passage of the Act, the British Parliament never again attempted directly to impose taxation upon any of its colonies, or overseas territories, except for the Taxation of Colonies Act 1778 which was passed during the American Revolution.

Even after the recognition of the independence of the United States, the Act continued to remain in force for the remaining colonies of the British Empire in the western hemisphere. 

The Act was repealed in 1964, with the handful of remaining British colonies in the West Indies already governed by constitutions explicitly granted under the authority of Parliament, and in particular by the West Indies Act 1962.

<doc id="340405" wikidata="Q12059906" url="?curid=340405" title="Herder">
<text>A herder is a pastoral worker responsible for the care and management of a herd or flock of domestic animals, usually on open pasture. It is particularly associated with nomadic or transhumant management of stock, or with common land grazing. The work is often done either on foot or mounted.

Depending on the type of animal being herd, the English language can give different professional names, for example, cowboy for cows, shepherd for sheep, or goatherd for goat.

== Terminology ==
Herders may be distinguished by sex (&quot;e.g.&quot;, herdsman, herdswoman or herdboy) or by the type of livestock, for example camelherd, cowherd, duckherd, goatherd or shepherd.

==By country==

===China===

Tibetan herding communities living in the Tibetan Plateau in the Sichuan Province of southwest China continued to graze herds on common lands even after the 1982 Household responsibility system. Several reasons have been given for the endurance of the traditional pastoral lifestyle:

*complex topography prevents the division of common grazing lands among individual households
*yaks require free grazing and become ill in fenced pasture
*rotation of grazing spots

Grassland degradation has been an issue. Herding communities and their leaders have taken steps to reach a consensus about sustainable grazing practices. These include developing the community political organization to enforce commitments to seasonal rotational grazing.

== By livestock type ==

=== Cows ===
There are numerous regional types of cow herder, many with a specific name; these include the stockman of Australia, the buttero, campino, csikós, gardian and gulyás in Europe, the buckaroo, charro, cowboy and vaquero in North America, and the gaucho, huaso, llanero, morochuco and of South America.

<text>Marcian Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Hoff Jr. (born October 28, 1937, in Rochester, New York) is one of the inventors of the microprocessor.

==Education and work history==
Hoff received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1958. He applied for his first two patents based on work done for the General Railway Signal Corp. of Rochester, New York during the summers of his undergraduate study. He received a National Science Foundation Fellowship to enroll in Stanford University, where he received his master&#x27;s degree in 1959 and his Ph.D. in 1962. As part of his Ph.D. dissertation, Hoff co-invented the least mean squares filter and the ADALINE neural network with Bernard Widrow.

Hoff joined Intel in 1968 as employee number 12 as &quot;manager of applications research&quot;, and is credited with coming up with the idea of using a &quot;universal processor&quot; rather than a variety of custom-designed circuits in the architectural idea and an instruction set formulated with Stanley Mazor in 1969 for the Intel 4004—the chip that started the microprocessor revolution in the early 1970s. Development of the silicon-gate design methodology and the actual chip design was done by Federico Faggin, who also led the project during 1970-1971. Masatoshi Shima from Busicom defined the logic.

In 1975 he started a group to work on large-scale integration for use in the telephone industry, resulting in various commercial products: first commercial monolithic telephone (named &quot;CODEC&quot;), first commercial switched-capacitor filter (for use with CODEC), a microprocessor for real-time digitizing analog signals (Intel 2920), and speech recognition hardware.

In 1980, Hoff was named the first Intel Fellow, which is the highest technical position in the company. He stayed in that position until 1983 when he left for Atari. After the video game crash of 1983, Atari was sold in 1984, and Hoff became an independent consultant. He then joined Teklicon in 1986 as an agent, and since 1990 as an employee.

==Popular culture==
Hoff was featured in an Intel advertisement, calling him the &quot;rock star&quot; of Intel and comparing him to the rock stars of American culture.

==Awards==
In 1954, he was one of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search (now Intel STS) finalists. He was awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1979, the IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award in 1980, and the Franklin Institute Certificate of Merit in 1996.

<text>The Cedar Rapids Kernels are a Minor League Baseball team of the Midwest League and the High-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. They are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and play their home games at Veterans Memorial Stadium. The Kernels are owned by Cedar Rapids Ball Club, Inc. (also known as Cedar Rapids Baseball Club, Inc.).

==Cedar Rapids baseball history==
Cedar Rapids first began play in 1890 and have played 110 seasons through 2015. The franchise has been a member of various leagues preceding the Midwest League. They have been a member of the Central Association (1949), Western League (1934–1937), Mississippi Valley League (1922–1932), Central Association (1913–1917), Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League (1901–1909, 1920–1921, 1938–1942, 1950–1961), Western Association (1896–1899), Eastern Iowa League (1895) and the Illinois–Iowa League (1890–1891). The team also had numerous nicknames prior to joining the Midwest League: Cedar Rapids Braves (1958–1962), Cedar Rapids Raiders (1953–1957), Cedar Rapids Indians (1950–1952), Cedar Rapids Rockets (1949), Cedar Rapids Raiders (1934–1942), Cedar Rapids Red Raiders (1963–1964), Cedar Rapids Bunnies (1904–1932), Cedar Rapids Rabbits (1896–1903) and Cedar Rapids Canaries (1890–1891).

When Cedar Rapids was awarded a Midwest League franchise in 1962, the franchise switched back to the Red Raiders (1962–1964) nickname. Subsequently, the team used the name of the major league franchise it affiliated with: the Cardinals (1965–1972), the Astros (1973–1974), the Giants (1975–1979), and the Reds (1980–1992). The team adopted the current &quot;Kernels&quot; nickname before the 1993 season. On the field, the franchise won Midwest League championships in 1988, 1992, 1994, and 2023.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Kernels were organized into the High-A Central. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==Ballpark==

The team&#x27;s first home ballpark was Belden Hill Park, followed by the original Veterans Memorial Stadium, which opened in 1949. In August 2000 voters approved a referendum to build a new ballpark adjacent to the old one, which was demolished after the 2001 season. The new Veterans Memorial Stadium was completed in time for the opening of the 2002 season, and the Kernels set a franchise attendance record of 196,066 in the new park&#x27;s inaugural year.

<doc id="340421" wikidata="Q147552" url="?curid=340421" title="Tagetes">
<text>Tagetes () is a genus of 50 species of annual or perennial, mostly herbaceous plants in the family Asteraceae. They are among several groups of plants known in English as marigolds. The genus &quot;Tagetes&quot; was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.

Originally called cempōhualxōchitl, by the Nahua peoples, these plants are native to Central and Southern Mexico and several other Latin American countries. Some species have become naturalized around the world. One species, &quot;T. minuta&quot;, is considered a noxious invasive plant in some areas.

==Description==
&quot;Tagetes&quot; species vary in size from 0.1 to 2.2 m tall. Most species have pinnate green leaves. Blooms naturally occur in golden, orange, yellow, and white colors, often with maroon highlights. Floral heads are typically (1-) to 4–6 cm diameter, generally with both ray florets and disc florets. In horticulture, they tend to be planted as annuals, although the perennial species are gaining popularity. Like all marigolds, they have a fibrous root system.

Depending on the species, &quot;Tagetes&quot; species grow well in almost any sort of soil. Most horticultural selections grow best in soil with good drainage, and some cultivars are known to have good tolerance to drought.

==Nomenclature==
The Latin &quot;Tagētes&quot; derives from the Tages in Etruscan mythology, born from plowing the earth. It likely refers to the ease with which plants of this genus come out each year either by the seeds produced in the previous year, or by the stems which regrow from the stump already in place.

The common name in English, marigold, is derived from &quot;Mary&#x27;s gold&quot; in honor of the Virgin Mary, a name first applied to a similar plant native to Europe, &quot;Calendula officinalis&quot;.

The most commonly cultivated varieties of &quot;Tagetes&quot; are known variously as African marigolds (usually referring to cultivars and hybrids of &quot;Tagetes erecta&quot;), or French marigolds (usually referring to hybrids and cultivars of &quot;Tagetes patula&quot;, many of which were developed in France). The so-called signet marigolds are hybrids derived mostly from &quot;Tagetes tenuifolia&quot;.

==Cultivation and uses==

Depending on the species, marigold foliage has a musky, pungent scent, though some varieties have been bred to be scentless. Due to antibacterial thiophenes exuded by the roots, &quot;Tagetes&quot; should not be planted near any legume crop. Some of the perennial species are deer-, rabbit-, rodent- and javelina or peccary-resistant.

&quot;T. minuta&quot; (khakibush or huacatay), originally from South America, has been used as a source of essential oil for the perfume industry known as tagette or &quot;marigold oil&quot;, and as a flavourant in the food and tobacco industries. It is commonly cultivated in South Africa, where the species is also a useful pioneer plant in the reclamation of disturbed land.

The florets of &quot;Tagetes erecta&quot; are rich in the orange-yellow carotenoid lutein and are used as a food colour (INS number E161b) in the European Union for foods such as pasta, vegetable oil, margarine, mayonnaise, salad dressing, baked goods, confectionery, dairy products, ice cream, yogurt, citrus juice and mustard. In the United States, however, the powders and extracts are only approved as colorants in animal feed.

Marigolds are recorded as a food plant for some Lepidoptera caterpillars including the dot moth, and a nectar source for other butterflies and bumblebees. They are often part of butterfly gardening plantings. In the wild, many species are pollinated by beetles.

==Cultural significance==

===&quot;Tagetes lucida&quot;===
The species &quot;Tagetes lucida&quot;, known as &quot;pericón&quot;, is used to prepare a sweetish, anise-flavored medicinal tea in Mexico. It is also used as a culinary herb in many warm climates, as a substitute for tarragon, and offered in the nursery as &quot;Texas tarragon&quot; or &quot;Mexican mint marigold&quot;.

===&quot;Tagetes minuta&quot;===
&quot;Tagetes minuta&quot;, native to southern South America, is a tall, upright marigold plant with small flowers used as a culinary herb in Peru, Ecuador, and parts of Chile and Bolivia, where it is called by the Incan term &quot;huacatay&quot;. The paste is used to make the popular potato dish called &quot;ocopa&quot;. Having both &quot;green&quot; and &quot;yellow/orange&quot; notes, the taste and odor of fresh &quot;T. minuta&quot; is like a mixture of sweet basil, tarragon, mint and citrus.
It is also used as a medicinal tea for gastrointestinal complaints and specifically against nematodes.

=== &quot;Tagetes erecta&quot; ===
&quot;Tagetes erecta&quot; is widely used in Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico.

===&quot;Tagetes&quot; – various species===
In Bangladesh, India and other South Asian countries, marigold is used for ornamentation purposes in functions like the turmeric ceremony, weddings, Pohela Falgun and other functions. During the colonial period the native varieties of these flowers were replaced by American species like &quot;T. erecta&quot;, &quot;T. patula&quot; and &quot;T. tenuifolia&quot;. The marigold is also widely cultivated in India and Thailand, particularly the species &quot;T. erecta&quot;, &quot;Tagetes patula&quot; and &quot;T. tenuifolia&quot;. It is always sold in the markets for daily rituals. Vast quantities of marigolds are used in garlands and decoration for weddings, festivals, and religious events. Marigold cultivation is extensively seen in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh (for the Vijayadashami and Diwali markets) states of India.

In Ukraine, &quot;chornobryvtsi&quot; (&quot;T. erecta&quot;, &quot;T. patula&quot; and the signet marigold, &quot;l. tenuifolia&quot;) are regarded as one of the national symbols, and are often mentioned in songs, poems and tales.

<text>Family Matters is an American television sitcom that originally aired on ABC for eight seasons from September 22, 1989, to May 9, 1997, then moved to CBS for its ninth and final season from September 19, 1997, to July 17, 1998. A spin-off of &quot;Perfect Strangers,&quot; the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, an African-American middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows&#x27; nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show&#x27;s breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.

Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, &quot;Family Matters&quot; became the second-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; with 253 episodes over 11 seasons. Both have since been exceeded by &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s House of Payne&quot; with 355 episodes as of 2023. &quot;Family Matters&quot; is the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to leave the air; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

== History ==
The series was a spinoff from the ABC sitcom &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;; both shows aired Friday nights on ABC&#x27;s primetime slot called &quot;TGIF&quot;. Jo Marie Payton played Harriette Winslow, the elevator operator at a newspaper where Larry Appleton and Balki Bartokomous also worked. Reginald VelJohnson, who was coming off of growing fame from his role in &quot;Die Hard&quot;, made an appearance on the show as Harriette&#x27;s husband Carl Winslow, a Chicago police officer. ABC and the producers loved the character Harriette for her great morale and quick-witted humor and decided to create a show that would focus on her and her family, husband Carl, son Eddie, elder daughter Laura, and younger daughter Judy (who appeared until the character was retconned after season four as having not existed).

In the pilot episode, &quot;The Mama Who Came to Dinner&quot;, the family had also opened their home to Carl&#x27;s street-wise mother, Estelle (Rosetta LeNoire), usually known as &quot;Mother Winslow&quot;. Prior to the start of the series, Harriette&#x27;s sister, Rachel Crawford and her infant son, Richie, had moved into the Winslow household after the death of Rachel&#x27;s husband. The Winslows&#x27; nerdy teenage next-door neighbor, Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), was introduced early in the first season, given a significant role midway through the season in the episode &quot;Laura’s First Date&quot;, and quickly became the focus of the show.

The popular sitcom was a mainstay of ABC&#x27;s TGIF lineup from 1989 until 1997, at which point it became part of the CBS Block Party lineup for its final season. &quot;Family Matters&quot; was produced by Bickley-Warren Productions (1991–1998) and Miller-Boyett Productions, in association with Lorimar Television (1989–1993) and later Warner Bros. Television (1993–1998). As the show progressed, episodes began to center increasingly on Steve Urkel, and other original characters also played by White, including Steve&#x27;s suave alter-ego, Stefan Urquelle (who is similar to Jaleel White&#x27;s real-life self), and his female cousin, Myrtle Urkel.

=== Network change ===
In early 1997, CBS picked up &quot;Family Matters&quot; and &quot;Step by Step&quot; in a $40 million deal to acquire the rights to the programs from ABC. ABC then promised to pay Miller-Boyett Productions $1.5 million per episode for a ninth and tenth season of &quot;Family Matters&quot;. However, tensions had risen between Miller-Boyett Productions and ABC&#x27;s corporate parent, The Walt Disney Company (which had bought ABC in 1996 as part of its merger with ABC&#x27;s then-parent Capital Cities/ABC Inc.). Miller-Boyett thought that it would not be a big player on ABC after ABC&#x27;s recent purchase by Disney.

Miller-Boyett Productions agreed to a $40 million offer from CBS for a 22-episode season for both &quot;Family Matters&quot; and &quot;Step By Step&quot;. CBS scheduled &quot;Family Matters&quot; along with &quot;Meego&quot; and &quot;Step By Step&quot; as a part of its new Friday lineup, branded as the &quot;CBS Block Party.&quot; The network scheduled the family-oriented block against ABC&#x27;s &quot;TGIF&quot; lineup, where the two series originated. Jo Marie Payton&#x27;s contract had just expired and she was reluctant to continue, feeling the show had jumped the shark years prior. She agreed to stay to keep continuity but left midseason shortly after nearly getting into a physical altercation with White in what would be her last regular episode; in that episode, White (playing a gangster instead of his usual Urkel) was attempting to insert material that violated Broadcast Standards and Practices. The resulting dispute between White and Payton escalated to the point where Darius McCrary had to separate the two. Payton would appear in only one more episode after that—a Christmas episode that also brought back several former characters from the ABC run who had been written out on CBS—before Judyann Elder took over as Harriette for the remainder of the season.

While &quot;Family Matters&quot; continued to lose viewership compared to previous years, it was initially a modest success on CBS, beating the show that replaced it, &quot;You Wish&quot;. &quot;Meego&quot;, however, was a ratings failure and was canceled after six weeks. After the holiday special season, CBS replaced &quot;Meego&quot; with &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot;, and with that show&#x27;s child-centered focus, it was placed in &quot;Family Matters&quot;″ 8/7c time slot. &quot;Family Matters&quot; was pushed an hour later and paired with &quot;Step by Step&quot;. The ratings for &quot;Family Matters&quot; fell even further in this later slot, and the entire block except for &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot; was canceled in spring 1998, with the remaining episodes burned off in the summer.

== Cast ==

== Episodes ==

== Production notes ==
&quot;Family Matters&quot; was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren (who also wrote for, and were producers of, parent series &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;) and developed by Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett (who also served as executive producers on &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;); all four also served as executive producers of the series. The series was produced by Miller-Boyett Productions, in association with Lorimar Television who co-produced the show until 1993, when Warner Bros. Television absorbed Lorimar (a sister company under the co-ownership of Time Warner).

Starting with season three, the series was also produced by Bickley-Warren Productions. The series was filmed in front of a live studio audience; the Lorimar-produced episodes were shot at Lorimar Studios (later Sony Pictures Studios) in Culver City, California, while the Warner Bros.-produced episodes were filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in nearby Burbank.

The show&#x27;s original theme was Louis Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;; it was scrapped after the fifth episode of season one (&quot;Straight A&#x27;s&quot;), though it was heard only in the pilot episode in syndicated reruns. The second theme, &quot;As Days Go By&quot;, written by Jesse Frederick, Bennett Salvay and Scott Roeme and performed by Frederick, was the theme for the majority of the series until 1995. The sixth season&#x27;s opening credits was last used in the season seven episodes &quot;Talk&#x27;s Cheap&quot; and &quot;Fa La La La Laagghh&quot;, the only two episodes during the final three seasons to feature the theme song (this was heard in season one episodes in ABC Family and syndicated airings). A longer version of &quot;As Days Go By&quot; was used during the first three seasons, though in syndicated reruns the short version is heard (in ABC Family airings, the long theme was used for all of the episodes during the first three seasons).

&quot;Family Matters&quot; is set in the same fictional universe as several other TV shows related to ABC&#x27;s TGIF or CBS&#x27;s Block Party. Before &quot;Family Matters,&quot; Harriette Winslow was originally the elevator operator at the &quot;Chicago Chronicle&quot; newspaper office in the third and fourth seasons of &quot;Perfect Strangers.&quot; &quot;Family Matters&quot; was a spin-off series given to this character in 1989. Characters from &quot;Family Matters&quot; appeared on other shows, including &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, &quot;Step by Step&quot; and &quot;Meego&quot;.

== Syndication ==
In September 1993, Warner Bros. Television Distribution began distributing &quot;Family Matters&quot; for broadcast in off-network syndication; most television stations stopped carrying the show by around 2002, though some stations in larger markets such as WTOG in Tampa, Florida continued to air &quot;Family Matters&quot; until as recently as 2005 and New York&#x27;s WPIX as 2006. In 1995, reruns of the series began airing on TBS Superstation, where it ran until 2003. TBS would air two episodes of Family Matters each weekday afternoon from October 1995 to September 1999. From 1999 to 2003, TBS only aired the series once per weekday typically playing in the early mornings. The series returned to TBS in 2020.

From 1997 to 2003, reruns of the series aired on WGN America. In 2003, ABC Family picked up the series and aired it for five years until February 29, 2008. From 2004 to 2006, UPN aired the show for 2 years. BET aired reruns briefly in December 2009 and began airing the series on a regular basis on March 1, 2013; the series returned to BET in mid-February 2023. MTV2 also began airing reruns on September 7, 2013. The show aired on Nick at Nite from June 29, 2008, to December 31, 2012. ABC Family and Nick at Nite airings cut the tag scenes at the end of all episodes, despite the fact that many episodes during the series have tag scenes during the closing credits. The series also aired on TV One from 2019 to 2023. In Canada, the series also aired on CTV, CBC and currently airs on Family Channel.

On September 29, 2017, &quot;Family Matters&quot; became available for streaming on Hulu. In the UK it aired on Sky One whilst &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; aired on BBC One.

Reruns of the series aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s ACME Night block in 2021.

TruTV began airing reruns in 2023 as part of their &quot;Comfort Food&quot; block.

On October 1, 2021, &quot;Family Matters&quot; began streaming on HBO Max after its streaming rights expired from Hulu, but has since returned to the Hulu platform.

==International airings==
In France, it aired as &quot;La Vie de famille&quot; (&quot;Family Life&quot;) as part of the show &quot;Club Dorothée&quot; on January 1, 1995, and on RTL9 (from August 28, 1995), France 2 &amp; M6 (from June 1, 2000).

In Germany, it premiered as &quot;Alle unter einem Dach&quot; (&quot;All under one roof&quot;) on ProSieben between September 4, 1995 and December 8, 1998.

In Italy, it aired as &quot;Otto sotto un tetto&quot; (&quot;Eight under one roof&quot;) on Canale 5, Italia 1 in 1992, with subsequent airings on Fox Retro &amp; Sky Atlantic.

In Croatia, the show aired as &quot;Pod istim krovom&quot; (&quot;Under The Same Roof&quot;) starting in September 2005 on RTL, and later on its sister channels RTL 2 and RTL Kockica.

In Spain it was known as &quot;Cosas de Casa&quot; (&quot;Home Things&quot;), broadcast on Antena 3 during the 90s, and is one of the most remembered dubbings.
When Jaleel White participated in the program &quot;Sorpresa Sorpresa&quot; (&quot;Surprise Surprise&quot;) he praised Pilar Coronado for her way of giving voice to Urkel.

== Home media ==
Warner Home Video has released the first four seasons of &quot;Family Matters&quot; on DVD in Region 1 while the remaining five seasons were released by the Warner Archive Collection. On February 4, 2014, Warner Home Video released season 4 on DVD, but consumers complained when it was found that the season 4 set contained syndication edits rather than the original broadcast masters. Warner Bros. responded to the complaints, offered a replacement program to receive corrected discs and reissuing the set with corrected broadcast copies on April 4, 2014. All episodes are the original broadcast form, except for the episode &quot;Number One With a Bullet&quot;, disc 1, episode 6. The entire series is also available for digital download on Amazon.com and the iTunes Store, all but season 6 remastered in both SD and HD.

A Complete Series DVD boxset was released on September 26, 2023

== &quot;Urkel Saves Santa: The Movie!&quot; ==
On September 1, 2021, it was announced an animated Christmas film &quot;Urkel Saves Santa: The Movie!&quot; (originally &quot;Did I Do That to the Holidays? A Steve Urkel Story&quot;) was planned to air on Cartoon Network as part of the block ACME Night in 2022. It was set to be released on HBO Max. However, on August 22, 2022, it was announced the film will not be moving forward on HBO Max and would be shopped elsewhere due to the Warner Bros. Discovery merger. Warner Bros. Discovery instead released the film on digital on November 21, 2023.

== &quot;A Family Matters Christmas&quot; ==
In 2022, a Christmas-themed movie titled &quot;A Family Matters Christmas&quot; was made and released direct-to-video on November 8, 2022. The plot focuses on a blended family in which the children switch bodies and learn about the others, and must work together to switch back. Jo Marie Payton and Kellie Shanygne Williams appear briefly. However, they play entirely new characters and the movie has no connection to the actual &quot;Family Matters&quot; show.

<doc id="340424" wikidata="Q104840547" url="?curid=340424" title="Goldenrod">
<text>Goldenrod is a common name for many species of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae, commonly in reference to the genus &quot;Solidago&quot;.

Several genera, such as &quot;Euthamia&quot;, were formerly included in a broader concept of the genus &quot;Solidago&quot;. Some authors treat &quot;Oligoneuron&quot;, the flat-topped goldenrods, as a separate genus than &quot;Solidago&quot;, while others consider it a section: &quot;Solidago&quot; sect. &quot;Ptarmicoidei&quot;.

Goldenrods can be used as a sustainable method to enrich soil with nitrogen. With an increase of nitrogen levels, there can then be an increase of vegetative growth.

Plants known as goldenrods include:

*&quot;Bigelowia&quot; spp., rayless goldenrods, 2 species native to the Southeastern United States
*&quot;Cuniculotinus gramineus&quot;, Panamint rock goldenrod
*&quot;Euthamia&quot; spp., flat-topped goldenrods or grass-leaved goldenrods, 5 species native to North America
*&quot;Gundlachia triantha&quot;, Trans-Pecos desert goldenrod
*&quot;Lorandersonia microcephala&quot;, small-headed heath goldenrod
*&quot;Medranoa palmeri&quot;, Texas desert goldenrod
*&quot;Petradoria pumila&quot;, rock goldenrod
*&quot;Solidago&quot; spp., goldenrods, around 120 species native to the Americas, northern Africa, Europe, Asia

<doc id="340428" wikidata="Q90595061" url="?curid=340428" title="Rosmarinus">
<text>Rosmarinus ( ) is a small taxonomic clade of woody, perennial herbs with fragrant evergreen needle-like leaves in the family Lamiaceae, native to the Mediterranean Basin.

In 2017 the species in the genus &quot;Rosmarinus&quot; were moved into the large genus &quot;Salvia&quot; based on taxonomic evidence. Thus &quot;Rosmarinus&quot; is no longer a genus, but still a monophyletic clade of species within &quot;Salvia&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Salvia rosmarinus&quot; (rosemary), widespread in the Mediterranean region, and &quot;Salvia jordanii&quot; (formerly &quot;Rosmarinus eriocalyx&quot;), native to northwest Africa and southern Spain have long been widely recognized. &quot;Salvia granatensis&quot; (formerly &quot;Rosmarinus tomentosus&quot;) was first recognized as a separate species in 1941. &quot;Rosmarinus palaui&quot; was first described as a species in 2002, although recognition of this species remains controversial. Recent research has indicated that while &quot;S. granatensis&quot; forms a monophyletic group, this group is nested within a paraphyletic &quot;S. jordanii&quot;.

&quot;Salvia jordanii&quot; differs from the well-known herb rosemary in its smaller leaves, only long and less than broad, and densely hairy flower stems. It also tends to be lower-growing, often under tall and prostrate, and never exceeding tall (&quot;S. rosmarinus&quot; can reach , exceptionally , tall).

Rosemary can be propagated from seed or cuttings in summer, and can be spread by carelessly discarding garden waste.

<text>Rheum (; from Greek: &quot;rheuma&quot; &#x27;a flowing, rheum&#x27;) is a thin mucus naturally discharged from the eyes, nose, or mouth, often during sleep (contrast with mucopurulent discharge). Rheum dries and gathers as a crust in the corners of the eyes or the mouth, on the eyelids, or under the nose. It is formed by a combination of mucus (in the case of the eyes, consisting of mucin discharged from the cornea or the conjunctiva), nasal mucus, blood cells, skin cells, or dust.

Rheum from the eyes is particularly common. Dried rheum near the eyes is commonly called &#x27;sleep&#x27;, ‘sleet’, &#x27;sleepy-seeds&#x27;, &#x27;sleepy buds&#x27;, &#x27;sleepy bugs&#x27;, &#x27;sleepy sand&#x27;, &#x27;sleepy winks&#x27;, &#x27;eye boogers&#x27;, &#x27;eye goop&#x27;, &#x27;sleepy dust&#x27;, &#x27;sleepies&#x27;, &#x27;eye gunk&#x27;, &#x27;eye crust&#x27;, &#x27;sleepy men&#x27;, &#x27;crusties&#x27;, &#x27;dozy dust&#x27;, &#x27;eye globs&#x27;, or &#x27;sleepy dirt&#x27;. When the individual is awake, blinking of the eyelid causes rheum to be washed away with tears via the nasolacrimal duct. The absence of this action during sleep, however, results in a small amount of dry rheum accumulating in corners of the eye. 
== Medical conditions ==
A number of conditions can increase the production of rheum in the eye. In the case of allergic conjunctivitis, the buildup of rheum can be considerable, preventing the patient from opening one or both of the eyes upon waking without prior cleansing of the eye area. The presence of pus in an instance of heavy rheum buildup can indicate dry eye or conjunctivitis, among other infections.

<doc id="340430" wikidata="Q4959355" url="?curid=340430" title="Punica">
<text>Punica is a small genus of fruit-bearing deciduous shrubs or small trees in the flowering plant family Lythraceae. The better known species is the pomegranate (&quot;Punica granatum&quot;). The other species, the Socotra pomegranate (&quot;Punica protopunica&quot;), is endemic to the island of Socotra. It differs in having pink (not red) flowers and smaller, less sweet fruit.

Although &quot;Punica&quot; was previously placed in its own family Punicaceae, recent phylogenetic studies have shown that it belongs in the family Lythraceae, and it is classified in that family by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.

The name is derived from the Latin word for the pomegranate, &quot;malum punicum&quot;, meaning &quot;Carthaginian apple&quot;.

The oldest fossils of the genus are from the Eocene of Europe, with the genus being widespread in Europe during the Miocene epoch.

<text>Prosopis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. The current circumscription of the genus contains three species found in northern Africa, the Middle East, Central and South Asia. Previously it also contained around 40 species of spiny trees and shrubs found in subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas and Africa. They often thrive in arid soil and are resistant to drought, on occasion developing extremely deep root systems. Their wood is usually hard, dense and durable. Their fruits are pods and may contain large amounts of sugar. The generic name means &quot;burdock&quot; in late Latin and originated in the Greek language.

==Species==

The current circumscription of the genus contains three species, which are found in South Asia, the Middle East and northern Africa.

* &quot;Prosopis cineraria&quot; – Persian mesquite, ghaf, khejri (Arabian Peninsula, Iran and South Asia)
* &quot;Prosopis farcta&quot; – Syrian mesquite (northern Africa, Middle East, Central and South Asia)
* &quot;Prosopis koelziana&quot; (Arabian Peninsula, Iraq and Iran)

Traditionally the genus included many more species with a cosmopolitan distribution. A taxonomic monograph in 1976 by Arturo Erhardo Burkart recognised 44 species and subdivided the genus into five sections: section &quot;Anonychium&quot; in Africa, section &quot;Prosopis&quot; in Asia, and sections &quot;Algarobia&quot;, &quot;Monilicarpa&quot; and &quot;Strombocarpa&quot; in the New World. Twelve additional species in section &quot;Algarobia&quot; have since been recognised. A genomic analysis published in 2022 concluded that &quot;Prospopsis&quot; was polyphyletic and that species traditionally grouped under the genus &quot;Prosopis&quot; belonged to four genera that broadly aligned with the Burkart&#x27;s sections: &quot;Anonychium&quot;, &quot;Neltuma&quot; (for sections &quot;Algarobia&quot; and &quot;Monilicarpa&quot;), &quot;Prosopis&quot;, and &quot;Strombocarpa&quot;.

The following phylogenetic tree shows the relationship of these genera (bold) with other closely related mimosoid genera.

== Phytochemistry ==
&quot;Prosopis&quot; species have been found to contain 5-hydroxytryptamine, apigenin, isorhamnetin-3-diglucoside, l-arabinose, quercetin, tannin, and tryptamine.

The tannins present in &quot;Prosopis&quot; species are of the pyrogallotannin and pyrocatecollic types. The tannins are mainly found in the bark and wood, while their concentration in the pods is low.

Some species, such as &quot;P. africana&quot; or &quot;P. velutina&quot;, produce a gum (mesquite gum).

==As an introduced and invasive species==
The species &quot;Prosopis pallida&quot; was introduced to Hawaii in 1828 and now dominates many of the drier coastal parts of the islands, where it is called the kiawe tree and is a prime source of monofloral honey production.

In Australia, invasive &quot;Prosopis&quot; species are causing severe economic and environmental damage. With their thorns and many low branches, &quot;Prosopis&quot; shrubs form impenetrable thickets which prevent cattle from accessing watering holes, etc. They also take over pastoral grasslands and suck up scarce water. &quot;Prosopis&quot; species cause land erosion due to loss of grassland that are habitats for native plants and animals. &quot;Prosopis&quot; thickets also provide shelter for feral animals such as pigs and cats.

For more information on invasiveness of mesquite species, see &quot;Prosopis glandulosa&quot; and &quot;Prosopis juliflora&quot;.

==Eradication==
Eradicating &quot;Prosopis&quot; is difficult because the plant&#x27;s bud regeneration zone can extend down to below ground level; the tree can regenerate from a piece of root left in the soil. Some herbicides are not effective or only partially effective against mesquite. Spray techniques for removal, while effective against short-term regrowth, are expensive, costing more than $70/acre ($170/hectare) in the USA. Removing large trees requires tracked equipment; costs can approach $2,000 per acre. In Australia, several techniques are used to remove &quot;Prosopis&quot;.

<doc id="340436" wikidata="Q310933" url="?curid=340436" title="Petroselinum">
<text>Petroselinum is a genus of two parsley species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, native to western and southern Europe and northern Africa.

Plants of this genus are bright green, hairless, biennial and herbaceous; they are rarely annual plants. In the first year, they form a rosette of pinnate to tripinnate leaves and a tap root used as a food store over the winter. In the second year they grow a flowering stem up to 1 m tall with sparser leaves and umbels of white or pinkish to yellowish-green flowers.

== Taxonomy ==
The generic name comes from rendering the Greek word &quot;petroselinon&quot; &quot;rock-celery&quot; into Latin, from &quot;petra&quot; &quot;rock, stone&quot; and &quot;selinon&quot; &quot;celery&quot;. Mycenaean Greek se-ri-no, in Linear B, is the earliest attested form of the word &quot;selinon&quot;.

== Species ==
The species of this genus are:
* &quot;Petroselinum crispum&quot; (garden parsley) from southern Europe and northern Africa (southern Italy, Greece, Algeria, Tunisia). It is an important culinary herb, widely used for flavouring and as a vegetable.
* &quot;Petroselinum segetum&quot; (corn parsley) from western Europe (Great Britain and the Netherlands south through France to Italy, Spain and Portugal). It is edible with a similar flavour like garden parsley, but it is not widely cultivated. It occurs in grassland, hedgerows, and river banks. In Great Britain, it is confined to lowland regions in southern and central England and southern Wales, and is scarce and declining due to agricultural intensification. It has narrower, more lanceolate leaves than garden parsley, only single pinnate, not tripinnate.
Plants of the World Online recognizes only &quot;P. crispum&quot; as species in this genus. &quot;P. segetum&quot; is instead recognized as a member of the genus &quot;Sison&quot;, and a synonym of &quot;Sison segetum.&quot;

<text>The New Zealand royal honours system, a system of orders, decorations and medals, recognises achievements of, or service by, New Zealanders or others in connection with New Zealand. Until 1975, New Zealand used the British honours system. Since then the country has introduced a number of uniquely New Zealand honours, and , only the dynastic British honours continue in active use in New Zealand, with the exception of the Order of the Companions of Honour (Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, a New Zealand soprano, was given the award in 2018).

The New Zealand royal honours comprise the Order of New Zealand, the New Zealand Order of Merit, the King&#x27;s Service Order, King&#x27;s Service Medal, New Zealand bravery awards, New Zealand gallantry awards, the New Zealand Distinguished Service Decoration and the New Zealand Antarctic Medal.

The monarch of New Zealand awards honours on ministerial advice. However, certain awards remain in the exclusive gift of the monarch.

The Honours Unit of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet administers the New Zealand honours system.

==History==

Since the beginning of settlement in the mid-nineteenth century, British honours were awarded in New Zealand. In 1848, Governor George Grey received the first honour granted to a New Zealand resident, becoming a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. For more than a hundred years the British honours system was used for New Zealand. In appropriate cases, this included peerages and baronetcies.

Bernard Freyberg, although not born in New Zealand and resident outside New Zealand for a considerable portion of his life, had significant connections with New Zealand, and was ennobled while serving as governor-general of New Zealand in 1951. The current bearer of the title, Valerian Freyberg, 3rd Baron Freyberg, is based in the United Kingdom and is one of the 92 hereditary peers elected to sit in the House of Lords.

Arthur Porritt, a New Zealand-born physician, surgeon, statesman and athlete, became a baronet in 1963 and was appointed governor-general of New Zealand in 1967 (the first person born in New Zealand to serve in this post), serving until 1972. He moved to live in England upon the expiry of his term as governor-general, and was later ennobled in 1973. Porritt was resident in England at the time he was made a baronet and at the time he received his peerage. His son, Jonathon Porritt, is a resident of England and is entitled to register his claim to his father&#x27;s baronetcy (but not to his peerage, since it was a life peerage). He has so far declined to do so.

In 1975, after a review of the system, two uniquely New Zealand honours were integrated into it: the Queen&#x27;s Service Order, and its affiliated Medal. In 1987, the Order of New Zealand was instituted as the supreme New Zealand honour.

In 1996, Robin Cooke, a New Zealand judge, was awarded a life peerage. Following his ennoblement until his retirement at the age of 75, Cooke sat in the British House of Lords as a law lord, and ex officio also in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which at that time was the highest authority in the New Zealand judicial system. Cooke is the only Commonwealth judge from outside Britain to have attained this distinction (James Atkin was born in Australia but only spent the first three years of his life there before returning permanently to England and Wales). The discontinuance of appeals to the Privy Council from New Zealand in 2003 (combined with the cessation of the judicial functions of the House of Lords since then) makes it unlikely that a similar honour will be granted in future on the strength of judicial services rendered in New Zealand.

A further review of the New Zealand royal honours system in 1996 and 1997 resulted in the termination of awards of almost all British honours and the creation of a new five-level New Zealand Order of Merit to replace them. In 2000, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced that no further awards of knighthoods and damehoods would be made in the New Zealand honours system. However, in March 2009, Prime Minister John Key announced the restoration of knighthoods and damehoods to the honours system, with past recipients of the two highest grades of the New Zealand Order of Merit to be eligible to receive titles.

==Orders and other honours==

* Orders. The Order of the Garter is the country&#x27;s highest civilian honour, then the Order of the Thistle, then the Order of Merit, then the Order of New Zealand, then the New Zealand Order of Merit (with five levels), then the Royal Victorian Order (also with five levels). The King&#x27;s Service Order has similar precedence to the fourth level of the New Zealand Order of Merit. The King&#x27;s Service Medal takes precedence after the New Zealand Order of Merit. Prior to the reorganisation of the New Zealand honours system in 1996, New Zealanders received various British Imperial honours, namely peerages and baronetcies of the United Kingdom, the Order of the Bath, Order of St Michael and St George, Order of the British Empire, and Knight Bachelor.
* Other decorations and medals. These usually do not carry titles, but nonetheless entitle the holder to place post nominals after their name. The New Zealand Antarctic Medal and the Distinguished Service Decoration are analogues to the Polar Medal and the Medal of the Order of the British Empire. (See British and Commonwealth orders and decorations.)
* The Most Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem (founded 1888). The Order is not technically a State Order or Royal Order, although the monarch is the Sovereign Head of the Order and the Governor-General of New Zealand is the Prior in New Zealand. It is, however, an official Order of Chivalry, being considered by DPMC as such. Membership of the Order confers official post-nominals commensurate with rank within the Order. The conferring of post-nominals in New Zealand is in contrast to other Priories where the Order&#x27;s leadership in those nations prohibits its members to use post-nominals outside of internal Order business. The Order&#x27;s members may wear its insignia, but do not enjoy de jour use of the title &quot;Sir&quot; associated with other Orders&#x27; levels of knighthood.
* Honours in the exclusive gift of the monarch such as the Order of the Garter, Order of the Thistle, Royal Victorian Order and Order of Merit are not conferred on ministerial advice and continue to be part of the New Zealand royal honours system.

==Māori Kīngi honours==

In 2014, King Tūheitia Pōtatau Te Wherowhero VII and the Māori King movement established an independent honours system outside the New Zealand and Commonwealth governments to recognize those individuals who have been strong supporters of Māori and Māori issues.

Speaking at the closing of the annual Koroneihana on 21 August 2014, Kīngi Tuheitia acknowledged that while honours were not typically the Māori way, they were necessary to celebrate the efforts of Māori allies and to put the acheivements of Māori individuals on equal standing as other sovereign states. 

Three separate orders were created, each with a badge repeating the motto seen on the Kīngitanga coat of arms, &quot;Ko te mana motuhake&quot;, meaning &quot;The self-determination and control over one’s own destiny&quot;. The senior-most honour, &quot;The Order of King Pootatau Te Wherowhero&quot;, also confers a collar upon investiture.

Tuheitia recognized Ihakara Porutu &quot;Kara&quot; Puketapu and Koro Tainui Wētere, both longtime New Zealand public servants and Māori community leaders as the founding members of the &quot;Order of the Taniwha&quot;. Dr Puketapu had previously turned down other National and Commonwealth honors, but lent his name to be invested in the Kīngitanga order. Named for the mythical beings that serve as guardians of the people, the award is meant to be an order of merit dedicated to individuals who have also served as guardians of the Māori people and heritage.

Hawaiian Princess Abigail Kawānanakoa and Taini Puahaere Rutene were named as the first recipients of &quot;The Illustrious Order of Te Arikinui Queen Te Atairangikaahu&quot; in the first and third grades of the order respectively. The award was named for Tuheitia&#x27;s mother, Te Atairangikaahu, the first Māori Queen and first Māori to be made a Dame of the British Empire. In 2023, Tuheitia recognized Queen Camilla as a first grade member of the order, suggesting that this award is dedicated to female individuals of regardless of ethnic origin for their support of indigenous culture and heritage, similar to the Japanese Order of the Precious Crown. 

Stated to be a dynastic order reserved exclusively for foreign heads of state, as King of the United Kingdom and Head of the Commonwealth, Charles III became the first recipient and founding member of &quot;The Order of King Pootatau Te Wherowhero&quot; in 2023. In doing so, Charles returned the favor Queen Te Atairangikaahu did in validating the New Zealand Order of Merit as its founding member, and in effect legitimatizes the honour as one given by a monarch to another, much as that of stranger members of the Order of the Garter. The award is named for the first Māori King and Tuheitia&#x27;s 6x grandfather, whose name he and every other Kīngi has adopted as their regnal name.

In 2015, Native Hawaiian Ivan Lui-Kwan, who serves as honorary Kīngitanga Ambassador to the United States and Hawaii was invested in the &quot;Order of the Taniwha&quot; (first class), and Nita Gregory, longtime aide to Queen Te Atairangikaahu, was honoured as a member of the &quot;The Illustrious Order of Te Arikinui Queen Te Atairangikaahu&quot; (third class).

<doc id="340439" wikidata="Q6590467" url="?curid=340439" title="List of Minor League Baseball leagues and teams">
<text>There are 14 Minor League Baseball (MiLB) leagues and 206 teams in operation across the United States, Dominican Republic, and Canada, which are affiliated with Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. They are organized by one of five classes (from highest to lowest): Triple-A, Double-A, High-A, Single-A, and Rookie. Of these, 120 teams in 11 leagues (from Triple-A to Single-A) are each affiliated with one MLB team through a standardized professional development license. Additionally, three leagues consisting of a total of 85 Rookie teams are located at MLB spring training complexes in Arizona and Florida, as well as in the Dominican Republic. These affiliated leagues contest their seasons during the MLB season.

The Arizona Fall League, consisting of six teams, operates in the autumn after the conclusion of the MiLB and MLB seasons to develop top prospects at various classifications.

Seven independent baseball leagues, consisting of a total of 69 teams, have no direct affiliation with Major League Baseball, though the American Association, Atlantic League, Frontier League, and Pioneer League are designated MLB Partner Leagues.

<doc id="340440" wikidata="Q2088206" url="?curid=340440" title="Fluid mosaic model">
<text>The fluid mosaic model explains various characteristics regarding the structure of functional cell membranes. According to this biological model, there is a lipid bilayer (two molecules thick layer consisting primarily of amphipathic phospholipids) in which protein molecules are embedded. The phospholipid bilayer gives fluidity and elasticity to the membrane. Small amounts of carbohydrates are also found in the cell membrane. The biological model, which was devised by Seymour Jonathan Singer and Garth L. Nicolson in 1972, describes the cell membrane as a two-dimensional liquid where embedded proteins are generally randomly distributed. For example, it is stated that &quot;A prediction of the fluid mosaic model is that the two-dimensional long-range distribution of any integral protein in the plane of the membrane is essentially random.&quot; 

==Chemical makeup==
==Experimental evidence==
The fluid property of functional biological membranes had been determined through labeling experiments, x-ray diffraction, and calorimetry. These studies showed that integral membrane proteins diffuse at rates affected by the viscosity of the lipid bilayer in which they were embedded, and demonstrated that the molecules within the cell membrane are dynamic rather than static.

Previous models of biological membranes included the and the Davson-Danielli Tri-Layer model. These models had proteins present as sheets neighboring a lipid layer, rather than incorporated into the phospholipid bilayer. Other models described repeating, regular units of protein and lipid. These models were not well supported by microscopy and thermodynamic data, and did not accommodate evidence for dynamic membrane properties.
An important experiment that provided evidence supporting fluid and dynamic biological was performed by Frye and Edidin. They used Sendai virus to force human and mouse cells to fuse and form a heterokaryon. Using antibody staining, they were able to show that the mouse and human proteins remained segregated to separate halves of the heterokaryon a short time after cell fusion. However, the proteins eventually diffused and over time the border between the two halves was lost. Lowering the temperature slowed the rate of this diffusion by causing the membrane phospholipids to transition from a fluid to a gel phase. Singer and Nicolson rationalized the results of these experiments using their fluid mosaic model.

The fluid mosaic model explains changes in structure and behavior of cell membranes under different temperatures, as well as the association of membrane proteins with the membranes. While Singer and Nicolson had substantial evidence drawn from multiple subfields to support their model, recent advances in fluorescence microscopy and structural biology have validated the fluid mosaic nature of cell membranes.

==Subsequent developments==

===Membrane asymmetry===
Additionally, the two leaflets of biological membranes are asymmetric and divided into subdomains composed of specific proteins or lipids, allowing spatial segregation of biological processes associated with membranes. Cholesterol and cholesterol-interacting proteins can concentrate into lipid rafts and constrain cell signaling processes to only these rafts. Another form of asymmetry was shown by the work of Mouritsen and Bloom in 1984, where they proposed a Mattress Model of lipid-protein interactions to address the biophysical evidence that the membrane can range in thickness and hydrophobicity of proteins.

===Non-bilayer membranes===
The existence of non-bilayer lipid formations with important biological functions was confirmed subsequent to publication of the fluid mosaic model. These membrane structures may be useful when the cell needs to propagate a non bilayer form, which occurs during cell division and the formation of a gap junction.
===Membrane curvature===
The membrane bilayer is not always flat. Local curvature of the membrane can be caused by the asymmetry and non-bilayer organization of lipids as discussed above. More dramatic and functional curvature is achieved through BAR domains, which bind to phosphatidylinositol on the membrane surface, assisting in vesicle formation, organelle formation and cell division. Curvature development is in constant flux and contributes to the dynamic nature of biological membranes.

===Lipid movement within the membrane===
During the 1970s, it was acknowledged that individual lipid molecules undergo free lateral diffusion within each of the layers of the lipid membrane. Diffusion occurs at a high speed, with an average lipid molecule diffusing ~2μm, approximately the length of a large bacterial cell, in about 1 second. It has also been observed that individual lipid molecules rotate rapidly around their own axis. Moreover, phospholipid molecules can, although they seldom do, migrate from one side of the lipid bilayer to the other (a process known as flip-flop). However, flip-flop movement is enhanced by flippase enzymes. The processes described above influence the disordered nature of lipid molecules and interacting proteins in the lipid membranes, with consequences to membrane fluidity, signaling, trafficking and function.

==Restrictions to lateral diffusion==

There are restrictions to the lateral mobility of the lipid and protein components in the fluid membrane imposed by zonation. Early attempts to explain the assembly of membrane zones include the formation of lipid rafts and “cytoskeletal fences”, corrals wherein lipid and membrane proteins can diffuse freely, but that they can seldom leave. These ideas remain controversial, and alternative explanations are available such as the proteolipid code.

===Lipid rafts===
Lipid rafts are membrane nanometric platforms with a particular lipid and protein composition that laterally diffuse, navigating on the liquid bilipid layer. Sphingolipids and cholesterol are important building blocks of the lipid rafts.
===Protein complexes===
Cell membrane proteins and glycoproteins do not exist as single elements of the lipid membrane, as first proposed by Singer and Nicolson in 1972. Rather, they occur as diffusing complexes within the membrane. The assembly of single molecules into these macromolecular complexes has important functional consequences for the cell; such as ion and metabolite transport, signaling, cell adhesion, and migration.
===Cytoskeletal fences (corrals) and binding to the extracellular matrix===

Some proteins embedded in the bilipid layer interact with the extracellular matrix outside the cell, cytoskeleton filaments inside the cell, and septin ring-like structures. These interactions have a strong influence on shape and structure, as well as on compartmentalization. Moreover, they impose physical constraints that restrict the free lateral diffusion of proteins and at least some lipids within the bilipid layer.
When integral proteins of the lipid bilayer are tethered to the extracellular matrix, they are unable to diffuse freely. Proteins with a long intracellular domain may collide with a fence formed by cytoskeleton filaments. Both processes restrict the diffusion of proteins and lipids directly involved, as well as of other interacting components of the cell membranes.


Septins are a family of GTP-binding proteins highly conserved among eukaryotes. Prokaryotes have similar proteins called paraseptins. They form compartmentalizing ring-like structures strongly associated with the cell membranes. Septins are involved in the formation of structures such as, cilia and flagella, dendritic spines, and yeast buds.

==Historical timeline==

* 1895 – Ernest Overton hypothesized that cell membranes are made out of lipids.
* 1925 – Evert Gorter and François Grendel found that red blood cell membranes are formed by a fatty layer two molecules thick, &quot;i.e.&quot; they described the bilipid nature of the cell membrane.
* 1935 – Hugh Davson and James Danielli proposed that lipid membranes are layers composed by proteins and lipids with pore-like structures that allow specific permeability for certain molecules. Then, they suggested a model for the cell membrane, consisting of a lipid layer surrounded by protein layers at both sides of it.
* 1957 – J. David Robertson, based on electron microscopy studies, establishes the &quot;Unit Membrane Hypothesis&quot;. This, states that all membranes in the cell, &quot;i.e.&quot; plasma and organelle membranes, have the same structure: a bilayer of phospholipids with monolayers of proteins at both sides of it.
* 1972 – SJ Singer and GL Nicolson proposed the fluid mosaic model as an explanation for the data and latest evidence regarding the structure and thermodynamics of cell membranes.
* 1997 – K Simons and E Ikonen proposed the lipid raft theory as an initial explanation of membrane zonation.
* 2024 – TA Kervin and M Overduin proposed the proteolipid code to fully explain membrane zonation as the lipid raft theory became increasingly controversial.

<text>The Fort Worth Cats was a professional baseball team based in Fort Worth, Texas, in the United States. The Cats were a member of the South Division of the now disbanded United League Baseball, which was not affiliated with Major League Baseball. From 2002 to 2014, the Cats played their home games at LaGrave Field.

Under the management of Wayne Terwilliger (2005) and Stan Hough (2006–2007), the team won the 2005 Central Baseball League championship and the 2006 and 2007 American Association championships.

==History==
The new Cats began play in Fort Worth in 2001 at Lon Goldstein Field, which was their temporary home until the new ballpark was constructed. They were named after the original Fort Worth Cats, who played mostly in the Texas League until 1964. Former Cats&#x27; owner Carl Bell commissioned a new Lagrave Field to be built directly on top of the original stadium&#x27;s location. Home plate is exactly where it was in 1926 when the old facility opened. On May 23, 2002, the Cats opened up the season in their brand new home. The team&#x27;s mascot was Dodger, whose namesake is a tribute to the Cats&#x27; affiliation with the great Brooklyn Dodgers teams in the 1940s and 1950s.

===2005===
Under the management of Wayne Terwilliger, the Cats defeated the San Angelo Colts for the 2005 Central Baseball League championship after beating the Pensacola Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs. It was Fort Worth&#x27;s first championship since 1948. They won both halves of the season with identical 30–17 records, which was a franchise record for wins in a season. The Cats also made the playoffs in 2003, which was Terwilliger&#x27;s first season as manager.

Stan Hough was named the Cats&#x27; new manager on December 6, 2005, taking over for Terwilliger, who remained with the club as Hough&#x27;s first base coach in 2006. Prior to being named the manager, Hough was the team&#x27;s hitting instructor from 2004 to 2005. Prior to the Cats&#x27; job, his last managerial job was with the Delmarva Shorebirds, which is a Class-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles, in 2003. He also managed the Triple-A Ottawa Lynx in 2001.

===2006===
In 2006, the Cats changed leagues and joined the new American Association. They won their second straight title and their first title in the new league by beating the St. Paul Saints 3 games to 2 in the championship series. The 2006 regular season record was 56–39 with a 0.589 winning percentage. The total season attendance was 177,894 for 46 games, which was an average of 3,867 per game.
Luke Hochevar pitched for the Cats in 2006, making four starts (1–1, 2.38 ERA) prior to being drafted #1 overall in the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft by the Kansas City Royals.

===2007===
On September 8, 2007, the Cats defeated the St. Paul Saints 4–1 in the fifth game of the American Association Championship playoffs to capture a second straight American Association Championship and third straight overall. The Cats had won 6 straight decisive Game 5&#x27;s and were 13–0 in games in which they faced elimination the last 3 seasons. They had been down 2 games to 1 in 5 of the last 6 series following a pattern of winning the first game, losing the next two, and then winning games 4 and 5. The only exception was when they were down 2–0 to the El Paso Diablos in the 2007 Division Series before winning 3 straight at LaGrave Field. The 2007 regular season record was 53–40 with a 0.570 winning percentage. Total season attendance was 141,330 for 34 games, which was an average of 4,157 per game.
Max Scherzer was on the Cats roster in 2007. In 2008, he was called up to the Arizona Diamondbacks.

===2008–2009===
The 2008 regular season record was 60–36 with a 0.625 winning percentage. Total season attendance was 185,380 for 47 games, which was an average of 3,944 per game. The team was named Organization of the Year.

The 2009 regular season record was 53–43 with a 0.552 winning percentage. Total season attendance was 177,807 for 48 games, which was an average 3,704 per game.

===2010===
The 2010 regular season record was 37–56 with a 0.398 winning percentage. Total season attendance was 122,062 for 41 games, which was an average of 2,707 per game.
The team was managed by Chad Tredaway, who was assisted by pitching coach James Frisbie, assistant coach Steve Maddock, and first base coach Wayne Terwilliger.
In November 2010, the Cats again hired Stan Hough as their new team manager. Hough also managed the team from 2006 to 2007, was 109–79, and led the Cats to the American Association championship in each season.

===2011===
The 2011 regular season record was 48–52 with a 0.480 winning percentage, which placed the team in second in the Southern Division. Total season attendance was 108,020 for 50 games, which was an average of 2,160 per game.
First baseman Trent Lockwood, and catcher Kelley Gulledge were named to the American Association Postseason All-Star Team. Heading into the season&#x27;s final game, Lockwood, in his first season with the team, was batting .338 with 20 HR, 90 RBI, a .621 slugging percentage, and 60 extra base hits. Gulledge was hitting .341 with 14 HR, 71 RBI, 125 hits, and 73 runs.
On December 21, 2011, it was announced that the team was sold to a group led by John Bryant and Byron Pierce, co-founders of United League Baseball, which had merged to become part of the North American Baseball League.

===2012===
In January 2012, Carl Bell and the LaGrave Reconstruction Co. declared bankruptcy, which cast doubt on the future of LaGrave Field. Several months later, the debt holder, Amegy Bank of Houston, foreclosed and became the landlord of the Cats.
On the field, the team reached the United League championship game in September 2012, but were swept by the Edinburg Roadrunners.

===2014===
In March 2014, the Cats announced the hiring of their new manager in Mike Marshall for the 2014 season. In May 2014, the Cats signed 55-year-old Julio Franco. The 1990 All-Star MVP last played professionally in 2008. During the 2014 season, Mike Marshall resigned his duties as manager. In July of that season, the Cats assigned the managerial duties to Barrett Weaver.

===Dissolution===
Due to an issue between the owner of the property on which LaGrave Field sits and the city of Fort Worth, the Cats were asked to relocate to another stadium after the 2014 season. Team owner John Bryant had stated the Cats intended to play the 2015 season, but acknowledged they might have to relocate to a different city in North Texas. In December 2014, Bryant stated that if the team could not find a place to play by January, the team&#x27;s future would be in doubt.

In January 2015, the Cats&#x27; league, United League Baseball (ULB) announced it had ceased operations after seven seasons. One of the glaring issues of the ULB in the 2014 season was their inability to draw fans. Brownsville and Rio Grande teams shared Harlingen Field, the Fort Worth Cats played out of LaGrave Field, and the San Angelo Colts played at Foster Field. The league drew an average of about 744 fans a game between the three venues. The club has not been active since the end of the ULB, and their former website is no longer in operation.
