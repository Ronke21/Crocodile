<text>The Tiananmen , also Tian&#x27;anmen, is the entrance gate of the Forbidden City imperial palace complex and Imperial City in the center of Beijing, China. It is widely used as a national symbol.

First built in 1420 during the Ming dynasty, Tiananmen was the entrance to the Emperor&#x27;s residence, through which all visitors to the palace walked. In 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People&#x27;s Republic of China from the balcony, which now features a large portrait of him. Tiananmen is located to the north of Tiananmen Square, and is separated from the plaza by Chang&#x27;an Avenue.

== Name ==
The Chinese name of the gate (/), is made up of the Chinese characters for &quot;heaven&quot;, &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;gate&quot; respectively, which is why the name is conventionally translated as &quot;Gate of Heavenly Peace&quot;. However, this translation is somewhat misleading, since the Chinese name is derived from the much longer phrase &quot;receiving the mandate from heaven, and pacifying the dynasty&quot;. (). The Manchu translation, &quot;Abkai elhe obure duka&quot;, lies closer to the original meaning of the gate and can be literally translated as the &quot;Gate of Heavenly Peacemaking&quot;. The gate had a counterpart in the northern end of the imperial city called the Di&#x27;anmen (, Dì&#x27;ānmén; Manchu: &quot;Na i elhe obure duka&quot;), which may be roughly translated as the &quot;Gate of Earthly Peace&quot;.

== Gate ==

=== History ===
The gate was originally named &quot;Chengtianmen&quot; (), or &quot;Gate of Accepting Heavenly Mandate&quot; in the Ming dynasty. It has subsequently been destroyed and rebuilt several times. The original building was first constructed in 1420, and was based on an eponymous gate of an imperial building in Nanjing. The gate was completely burned down by lightning in July 1457. In 1465, the Chenghua Emperor ordered Zigui (), the Minister of Works, to rebuild the gate. Thus, the design was changed from the original paifang form to the gatehouse that is seen today. It suffered another blow in the war at the end of the Ming dynasty, when in 1644 the gate was burnt down by rebels led by Li Zicheng. Following the establishment of the Qing dynasty and the Manchu conquest of China proper, the gate was once again rebuilt, beginning in 1645, and was given its present name upon completion in 1651. The gate was reconstructed again between 1969 and 1970. The gate as it stood was by then 300 years old, and had badly deteriorated, partly due to heavy usage in the 1950s and 1960s. As the gate was a national symbol, Zhou Enlai ordered that the rebuilding was to be kept secret. The whole gate was covered in scaffolding, and the project was officially called a &quot;renovation&quot;. The rebuilding aimed to leave the gate&#x27;s external appearance unchanged while both making it more resistant to earthquakes and installing modern facilities such as an elevator, water supply, and heating system.
=== Description ===
The building is long, wide and high. Like other official buildings of the empire, the gate itself has unique imperial roof decorations.

Two lions stand in front of the gate, and two more guard the bridges. In Chinese culture, lions are believed to protect humans from evil spirits.

Two stone columns, called huabiao, each with an animal (&quot;hou&quot;) on top of it, also stand in front of the gate. Originally, these installations were designed for commoners to address their grievances by either writing or sticking petitions on the columns. However, the examples in front of the Imperial City were purely decorative, and instead connoted the majesty of the imperial government.

The western and eastern walls have giant placards; the left one reads &quot;Long Live the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; (), while the right one reads &quot;Long Live the Great Solidarity of the World&#x27;s Peoples&quot; (). The right placard used to read &quot;Long Live the Central People&#x27;s Government&quot; () for the founding ceremony of the PRC, but later it was changed to &quot;Long Live the Great Solidarity of the World&#x27;s Peoples&quot;. Both placards were changed to use simplified Chinese instead of traditional Chinese characters in 1964. The phrasing has significant symbolic meaning, as the phrase used for &quot;long live&quot;, like the Imperial City itself, was traditionally reserved for Emperors of China, but is now available to the common people.

The reviewing stands in the foreground are used on International Workers Day (May Day) and on the National Day (October 1) of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In front of the stands is the Imperial City&#x27;s moat, still filled with water but now containing decorative illuminated fountains.

In ancient times, the Tiananmen was among the most important gates encountered when entering Beijing&#x27;s Imperial City along with the Yongdingmen, Qianmen, the Gate of China. Proceeding further inward, the next gate is the &#x27;Upright Gate&#x27;, identical in design to the Tian&#x27;anmen; behind it is the southern entrance of the Forbidden City itself, known as the Meridian Gate.

== Portrait ==
=== History ===

Because of the gate&#x27;s position at the front of the Imperial City, and the historical events that have taken place on Tiananmen Square, the gate has great political significance. In 1925, when China was ruled by the Nationalist government, a large portrait of Sun Yat-sen was hung at the gate after his death. In 1945, to celebrate the victory over Japan, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s portrait was hung.

On July 7, 1949, portraits of Zhu De and Mao Zedong were hung to commemorate the Second Sino-Japanese War. Since the founding date of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on October 1, 1949, a singular portrait of Mao has been hung on the gate. The portrait is replaced annually before National Day. On only one occasion, on March 9, 1953, it was temporarily replaced by a portrait of Joseph Stalin to commemorate his death.

In 2011, Alexander Pann Han-tang, chairman of the Asia Pacific Taiwan Federation of Industry and Commerce, and a close friend of Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou, proposed that the picture of Sun Yat-sen be displayed at Tiananmen Square instead for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. However, this proposal was rejected.

=== Incidents ===
The portrait weighs , and is replaced by a spare whenever it is vandalized. In 1989, three dissidents, including Yu Dongyue, attacked the portrait with eggs during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Yu was sentenced to life imprisonment but was released on bail 17 years later in 2006. On May 12, 2007, the portrait of Mao caught fire. A 35-year-old unemployed man from Urumqi was arrested for the incident. About 15% of the portrait was damaged, and had to be repaired later. On April 5, 2010, a protester threw ink in a plastic bottle and hit a wall near the portrait. He was then arrested.

== National symbol ==
Due to its historical significance, Tiananmen is featured on the National Emblem of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It has also been featured in the designs of stamps and coins issued by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.
== Public access ==

Tiananmen is open to the public each day of the week from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Tickets must be booked online through the Weixin (Wechat) Mini Program at least one day before; it is not possible to buy tickets on the day or on-site.

Line 1 of the Beijing Subway has stops at Tiananmen West and Tiananmen East, on each side of Tiananmen.

City buses 1, 2, 5, 52, 82, 120, 1, 2, 1, 2, and 17 stop near Tiananmen.

<text>Hungary has 3,152 municipalities as of July 15, 2013: 346 towns (Hungarian term: , plural: ; the terminology does not distinguish between cities and towns – the term town is used in official translations) and 2,806 villages (Hungarian: , plural: ) of which 126 are classified as large villages (Hungarian: , plural: ). The number of towns can change, since villages can be elevated to town status by act of the President. The capital Budapest has a special status and is not included in any county while 25 of the towns are so-called cities with county rights. All county seats except Budapest are cities with county rights.

Four of the cities (Budapest, Miskolc, Győr, and Pécs) have agglomerations, and the Hungarian Statistical Office distinguishes seventeen other areas in earlier stages of agglomeration development.

The largest city is the capital, Budapest, while the smallest town is Pálháza with 1038 inhabitants (2010). The largest village is Solymár (population: 10,123 as of 2010). There are more than 100 villages with fewer than 100 inhabitants while the smallest villages have fewer than 20 inhabitants.

<text>This is a list of [[cities]] and towns in [[North Macedonia]]. There are 34 cities and towns in North Macedonia. In Macedonian, every city or town, regardless of size, is called &quot;grad&quot; (&quot;град&quot;, pl. &quot;gradovi&quot;, &quot;градови&quot;), but a smaller one can also be called &quot;gratče&quot; (&quot;гратче&quot;, pl. &quot;гратчиња&quot;, &quot;gratčinja&quot;), a diminutive of &quot;grad&quot;. Only five cities in the country have a population of more than 50,000 inhabitants. The capital, Skopje, and its metropolitan area are home to about 33% of the country&#x27;s total population. The 2002 census showed that the majority of the population, 59.5%, lived in urban areas.

The five largest cities in North Macedonia, each with a population of over 50,000 inhabitants, are: Skopje (526,502), Kumanovo (75,051), Bitola (69,287), Prilep (63,308) and Tetovo (63,176).

Fifteen cities in the country have a population between 10,000 and 50,000 inhabitants: Štip (42,000), Veles (40,664), Ohrid (38,818), Strumica (33,825), Gostivar (32,814), Kavadarci (32,038), Kočani (24,632), Kičevo (23,428), Gevgelija (15,156), Struga (15,009), Radoviš (14,460), Kriva Palanka (13,481), Negotino (12,488), Debar (11,735) and Sveti Nikole (11,728).

Fourteen cities have a population of less than 10,000 inhabitants: Probištip (9,760), Delčevo (9,644), Vinica (8,584), Resen (7,904), Berovo (5,850), Kratovo (5,401), Bogdanci (5,244), Makedonska Kamenica (4,368), Kruševo (4,104), Valandovo (3,671), Makedonski Brod (3,643), Demir Kapija (2,643), Pehčevo (2,471) and Demir Hisar (2,431).

<doc id="343375" wikidata="Q1508788" url="?curid=343375" title="Monopoly on violence">
<text>In political philosophy, a monopoly on violence or monopoly on the legal use of force is the property of a polity that is the only entity in its jurisdiction to legitimately use force, and thus the supreme authority of that area.

While the monopoly on violence as the defining conception of the state was first described in sociology by Max Weber in his essay &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot; (1919), the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force is a core concept of modern public law, which goes back to French jurist and political philosopher Jean Bodin&#x27;s 1576 work &quot;Les Six livres de la République&quot; and English philosopher Thomas Hobbes&#x27;s 1651 book &quot;Leviathan&quot;. Weber claims that the state is the &quot;only human &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; which lays claim to the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force. As such, states can resort to coercive means such as incarceration, expropriation, humiliation, and death threats to obtain the population&#x27;s compliance with its rule and thus maintain order. However, this monopoly is limited to a certain geographical area, and in fact this limitation to a particular area is one of the things that defines a state.&quot; In other words, Weber describes the state as any organization that succeeds in holding the exclusive right to use, threaten, or authorize physical force against residents of its territory. Such a monopoly, according to Weber, must occur via a process of legitimation.

==Max Weber&#x27;s theory==
Max Weber wrote in &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot; that a fundamental characteristic of statehood is the claim of such a monopoly. An expanded definition appears in &quot;Economy and Society&quot;:

Weber applied several caveats to this definition:
* He intended the statement as a contemporary observation, noting that the connection between the state and the use of physical force has not always been so close. He uses the examples of feudalism, where private warfare was permitted under certain conditions, and of religious courts, which had sole jurisdiction over some types of offenses, especially heresy and sex crimes (thus the nickname &quot;bawdy courts&quot;). Regardless, the state exists wherever a single authority can legitimately authorize violence.
* For the same reasons, &quot;monopoly&quot; does not mean that only the government may use physical force, but that the state is that human community that successfully claims for itself to be the only source of legitimacy for all physical coercion or adjudication of coercion. For example, the law might permit individuals to use force in defense of one&#x27;s self or property, but this right derives from the state&#x27;s authority. This conflicts directly with enlightenment principles of individual sovereignty that delegates power to the state by consent, and concepts of natural law that hold that individual rights deriving from sapient self-ownership preexist the state and are only recognised and guaranteed by the state which may be restricted from limiting them by constitutional law.

==Relation to state capacity ==

The capacity of a state is often measured in terms of its fiscal and legal capacity. Fiscal capacity meaning the state&#x27;s ability to recover taxation, and legal capacity meaning the state&#x27;s supremacy as sole arbiter of conflict resolution and contract enforcement. Without some sort of coercion, the state would not otherwise be able to enforce its legitimacy in its desired sphere of influence. In early and developing states, this role was often played by the &quot;stationary bandit&quot; who defended villagers from roving bandits, in the hope that the protection would incentivize villagers to invest in economic production, and the stationary bandit could eventually use its coercive power to expropriate some of that wealth.

In regions where state presence is minimally felt, non-state actors can use their monopoly on violence to establish legitimacy, or maintain power. For example, the Sicilian Mafia originated as a protection racket providing buyers and sellers in the black market with protection. Without this type of enforcement, market participants would not be confident enough to trust their counter-parties to honor contracts and the market would collapse.

In unorganized and underground markets, violence is used to enforce contracts in the absence of accessible legal conflict resolution. Charles Tilly continues this comparison to say that warmaking and statemaking are actually the best representations of what organized crime can grow into. The relationship between the state, markets and violence has been noted as having a direct relationship, using violence as a form of coercion. Anarchists view a direct relationship between capitalism, authority, and the state; the notion of a monopoly of violence is largely connected to anarchist philosophy of rejection of all unjustified hierarchy.

==Other==
According to Raymond Aron, international relations are characterized by the absence of widely acknowledged legitimacy in the use of force between states.

Martha Lizabeth Phelps takes Weber&#x27;s ideas on the legitimacy of private security a step further, claiming that the use of private actors by the state remains legitimate if and only if military contractors are perceived as being controlled by the state.

In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, &amp; Conflict&quot;, Jon D. Wiseman points out that a state&#x27;s monopoly on violence is conferred by the people of that state in exchange for protection of their person and property, which in turn grants states the ability to coerce and exploit people through, for example, taxation.

<text>The Dormition of the Mother of God is a Great Feast of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic Churches (except the East Syriac churches). It celebrates the &quot;falling asleep&quot; (death) of Mary the &quot;Theotokos&quot; (&quot;Mother of God&quot;, literally translated as &quot;God-bearer&quot;), and her being taken up into heaven. The Feast of the Dormition is observed on August 15, which for the churches using the Julian calendar corresponds to August 28 on the Gregorian calendar. The Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates the Dormition not on a fixed date, but on the Sunday nearest 15 August. In Western Churches the corresponding feast is known as the Assumption of Mary, with the exception of the Scottish Episcopal Church, which has traditionally celebrated the Falling Asleep of the Blessed Virgin Mary on August 15.

Christian canonical scriptures do not record the death or Dormition of Mary. Hippolytus of Thebes, a 7th- or 8th-century author, writes in his partially preserved chronology of the New Testament that Mary lived for 11 years after the death of Jesus, dying in AD 41.

The use of the term &quot;dormition&quot; expresses the belief that the Virgin died without suffering, in a state of spiritual peace. This belief does not rest on any scriptural basis, but is affirmed by Orthodox sacred tradition. Some apocryphal writings testify to this opinion, though neither the Orthodox Church nor other Christians accord them scriptural authority. The Orthodox understanding of the Dormition is compatible with Roman Catholic teaching, and was the dominant belief within the Western Church until late in the Middle Ages, when the slightly different belief in the bodily Assumption of Mary into heaven began to gain ground. Pope Pius XII declared the latter a dogma of the Catholic Church in 1950.

== Dormition fast ==

The Feast of the Dormition is preceded by a two-week fast, referred to as the Dormition Fast. From August 1 to August 14 (inclusive) Orthodox and Eastern Catholics fast from red meat, poultry, meat products, dairy products (eggs and milk products), fish, oil, and wine. In churches that follow the old or Julian Calendar, the fast is from August 14 to August 28. In the Coptic Orthodox Church, Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, whose calendar is generally consistent with the Julian Calendar, the dates of the fast are from August 7 to August 22.

The Dormition Fast is a stricter fast than either the Nativity Fast (Advent) or the Apostles&#x27; Fast, with only wine and oil (but no fish) allowed on weekends. As with the other Fasts of the Church year, there is a Great Feast that falls during the Fast; in this case, the Transfiguration (August 6), on which fish, wine and oil are allowed.

In some places, the services on weekdays during the Dormition Fast are similar to the services during Great Lent (with some variations).
Many churches and monasteries in the Russian tradition perform the lenten services on at least the first day of the Dormition Fast. In the Greek tradition, during the Fast either the Great Paraklesis (Supplicatory Canon) or the Small Paraklesis is celebrated every evening except Saturday evening and the Eves of the Transfiguration and the Dormition.

The first day of the Dormition Fast is a feast day called the Procession of the Cross (August 1), on which day it is customary to have an outdoor procession and perform the Lesser Blessing of Water. In Eastern Orthodoxy it is also the day of the Holy Seven Maccabees, Martyrs Abimus, Antonius, Gurias, Eleazar, Eusebonus, Alimus, and Marcellus, their mother Solomonia, and their teacher Eleazar. Therefore, the day is sometimes referred to as &quot;Makovei&quot;. Finally it is also considered the First of the three &quot;Feasts of the Saviour&quot; in August, the Feast to the All-Merciful Saviour and the Most Holy Mother of God.

== Term ==

In Orthodoxy and Catholicism, in the language of the scripture, death is often called a &quot;sleeping&quot; or &quot;falling asleep&quot; (Greek κοίμησις; whence κοιμητήριον &gt; &quot;coemetērium&quot; &gt; cemetery, a place of sleeping; Latin: &quot;dormire&quot;, to sleep). A prominent example of this is the name of this feast; another is the Dormition of Saint Anna, Mother of the Virgin Mary.

== Origin and adoption of the tradition ==

=== 1st–5th century ===
The first Christian century may be silent, but anonymous traditions concerning the Dormition began circulating as early as the third century and perhaps &#x27;even earlier&#x27; such as the &quot;Book of Mary&#x27;s Repose&quot;. According to some, before the 4th-5th century the Dormition was not celebrated among the Christians as a holy day.

Recent scholarship has shown that &quot;The Dormition/Assumption of Mary&quot; (attributed to John the Theologian or &#x27;Pseudo-John&#x27;), another anonymous narrative, may even precede the &quot;Book of Mary&#x27;s Repose&quot;. This Greek document, edited by Tischendorf and published in &quot;The Ante-Nicene Fathers&quot;, is dated by Tischendorf as no later than the 4th century. The Greek sources for the early period are only late copies and the first transmissions and earliest witnesses can be only found and accessed through the fragmentary translations into Christian Palestinian Aramaic and Syriac. Shoemaker identifies liturgical elements in &quot;Pseudo-John&quot;, and the &quot;Six Books Apocryphon&quot; (dated to the early fourth century), which implies that the Dormition was a holy day in some circles by the 4th century. Additionally, the earliest known appearance of the Dormition in art is found on a sarcophagus in the crypt of a church in Zaragoza in Spain dated c. 330.

The written historical and archaeological record aside, a fairly representative example of mainstream Orthodox teaching is that Church Tradition preserved a more ubiquitous oral tradition. According to Sophia Fotopoulou, &quot;We have no historical data to indicate how long the Mother of God remained on earth after the ascension of Christ into heaven, nor when, where, or how she died, for the Gospels say nothing of this. The foundation for the feast of the Dormition is to be found in a sacred tradition of the Church dating from apostolic times, apocryphal writings, the constant faith of the People of God, and the unanimous opinion of the holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church of the first thousand years of Christianity.&quot;

Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 310/20–403), a Jew by birth, born in Phoenicia, converted to Christianity in adulthood and lived as a monk for over 20 years in Palestine from 335–340 to 362, writes in &quot;Panarion&quot; in &quot;Contra antidicomarianitas&quot; about the end of the Virgin Mary the following:

If any think [I] am mistaken, moreover, let them search through the scriptures any neither find Mary&#x27;s death, nor whether or not she died, nor whether or not she was buried—even though John surely travelled throughout Asia. And yet, nowhere does he say that he took the holy Virgin with him. Scripture simply kept silence because of the overwhelming wonder, not to throw men&#x27;s minds into consternation. For I dare not say—though I have my suspicions, I keep silent. Perhaps, just as her death is not to be found, so I may have found some traces of the holy and blessed Virgin. ...The holy virgin may have died and been buried—her falling asleep was with honour, her death in purity, her crown in virginity. Or she may have been put to death—as the scripture says, &#x27;And a sword shall pierce through her soul&#x27;—her fame is among the martyrs and her holy body, by which light rose on the world, [rests] amid blessings. Or she may have remained alive, for God is not incapable of doing whatever he wills. No one knows her end.
In the next chapter, Epiphanius compares Mary with three different people, who died in three different ways: Elijah, who was assumed into Heaven; John, who died a normal death; and Thecla, who was a martyr. This further shows that he was open to various options for her end, and did not know which of the options she actually experienced.

And if I should say anything more in her praise, [she is] like Elijah, who was virgin from his mother’s womb, he always remained so perpetually, and was assumed and has not seen death. She is like John who leaned on the Lord’s breast, “the disciple whom Jesus loved.” She is like St. Thecla; and Mary is still more honored than she, because of the providence vouchsafed her.

Ambrose, however, who was a contemporary of Epiphanius, dismissed the view that Mary was martyred when exegeting Saint Simeon&#x27;s prophecy in (Luke 2.35), seemingly critiquing those who took the prophecy literally, and reducing the number of options to either natural death or assumption:

Neither the letter of Scripture nor history teaches that Mary passed from this life by suffering execution, for it is not the soul but the body [some speculate] which is pierced through and through by the material sword.

=== Late 5th until 7th century ===
More Dormition traditions began surfacing in manuscripts during the late 5th century. Stephen Shoemaker characterised them as the &quot;Palm of the Tree of Life&quot; narratives, the &quot;Bethlehem&quot; narratives, and the &quot;Coptic&quot; narratives—aside from a handful of atypical narratives.

The events of the Dormition of the Virgin and her burial are dealt with in several known apocrypha such as the &quot;Liber de transitu Virginis Mariae&quot; by Pseudo-Melito of Sardis (5th century), a passing reference in Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and narratives by Pseudo-Cyril of Jerusalem, and Pseudo-Evodius. Around this time, the first Dormition narratives among mainstream authors appear, namely Jacob of Serug and Theodosius of Alexandria. These late—5th and 6th century Dormition narratives come from differing communions, so not all of their content was accepted, but only the basic idea that the Virgin Mary blissfully rested and her soul was received in heaven by her Son Jesus Christ at Dormition.

According to Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos in his &quot;History of the Church,&quot; Emperor Maurice (582–602) issued an edict which set the date for the celebration of the Dormition on August 15. After this time more &quot;mainstream&quot; Dormition narratives began appearing, their content still in part based upon the earlier, mostly anonymous, narratives. Modestus, Patriarch of Jerusalem (630–632) said at this celebration, while preaching, that he regrets the lack of specific information about the death of the Virgin Mary. According to Truglia, &quot;John of Thessalonica,&quot; another 7th century author, &quot;wrote a narrative admittedly based upon details found in earlier homilies.&quot; Theoteknos, bishop of Livias sometime between 550 and 650, also wrote a Dormition narrative similar in its content.

In Rome the feast called Dormitio Beatae Virginis was established by Pope Sergius I (687–701), borrowed from Constantinople.

== Narrative ==
According to later tradition, Mary, having spent her life after Pentecost supporting and serving the nascent Church, was living in the house of the Apostle John, in Jerusalem, when the Archangel Gabriel revealed to her that her death would occur three days later. The apostles, scattered throughout the world, are said to have been miraculously transported to be at her side when she died. The sole exception was Thomas, who was preaching in India. He is said to have arrived in a cloud above her tomb exactly three days after her death, and to have seen her body leaving to heaven. He asked her &quot;Where are you going, O Holy One?&quot;, at which she took off her girdle and gave it to him saying &quot;Receive this my friend&quot;, after which she disappeared.

Thomas was taken to his fellow apostles, whom he asked to see her grave, so that he could bid her goodbye. Mary had been buried in Gethsemane, according to her request. When they arrived at the grave, her body was gone, leaving a sweet fragrance. An apparition is said to have confirmed that Christ had taken her body to heaven after three days to be reunited with her soul. Eastern Orthodox theology teaches that the Theotokos has already undergone the bodily resurrection, which all will experience at the second coming, and stands in heaven in that glorified state which the other righteous ones will only enjoy after the Last Judgment.

== Related sites ==
The Dormition tradition is associated with various places, most notably with Jerusalem, which contains Mary&#x27;s Tomb and the Basilica of the Dormition, and Ephesus, which contains the House of the Virgin Mary, and also with Constantinople where the Cincture of the Theotokos was enshrined from the 5th through 14th centuries.

== Dormition versus Assumption ==
Eastern Christians celebrate the Dormition of the Theotokos on August 15 (August 28, N.S. for those following the Julian Calendar), the same calendar day as the Roman Catholic Feast of the Assumption of Mary. &quot;Dormition&quot; and &quot;Assumption&quot; are the different names respectively in use by the Eastern and Western traditions relating to the end of Mary&#x27;s life and to her departure from the earth, although the beliefs are not necessarily identical. Both views agree that she was taken up into heaven bodily.

=== Orthodox view ===
The Orthodox Church specifically holds one of the two Roman Catholic alternative beliefs, teaching that Mary died a natural death, like any human being; that her soul was received by Christ upon death; and that her body was resurrected on the third day after her repose, at which time she was taken up, both in body and soul, into heaven when the apostles, miraculously transported from the ends of the earth, found her tomb to be empty. The specific belief of the Orthodox is expressed in their liturgical texts used at the feast of the Dormition.

The Eastern Catholic observance of the feast corresponds to that of their Orthodox counterparts, whether Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox.

=== Catholic view ===

The Catholic doctrine of the Assumption covers Mary&#x27;s bodily assumption to heaven, but the dogmatic definition avoids saying whether she was dead or alive at that point. The question had long been in dispute in Catholic theology; although Catholic art normally portrays her as alive at the point of assumption, but typically rising from a sarcophagus, many Catholics believe she had died in the normal way. Pope Pius XII alludes to the fact of her death at least five times, but left open the question of whether or not Mary actually underwent death in connection with her departure, in his Apostolic constitution, &quot;Munificentissimus Deus&quot; (1950), which dogmatically defined ex cathedra (i.e., infallibly) the Assumption.

On 25 June 1997 during a General Audience Pope John Paul II stated that Mary experienced natural death prior to her assumption into Heaven, stating:

It is true that in Revelation death is presented as a punishment for sin. However, the fact that the Church proclaims Mary free from original sin by a unique divine privilege does not lead to the conclusion that she also received physical immortality. The Mother is not superior to the Son who underwent death, giving it a new meaning and changing it into a means of salvation. Involved in Christ&#x27;s redemptive work and associated in his saving sacrifice, Mary was able to share in his suffering and death for the sake of humanity&#x27;s Redemption. What Severus of Antioch says about Christ also applies to her: “Without a preliminary death, how could the Resurrection have taken place?” (Antijulianistica, Beirut 1931, 194f.). To share in Christ&#x27;s Resurrection, Mary had first to share in his death. The New Testament provides no information on the circumstances of Mary&#x27;s death. This silence leads one to suppose that it happened naturally, with no detail particularly worthy of mention. If this were not the case, how could the information about it have remained hidden from her contemporaries and not have been passed down to us in some way? As to the cause of Mary&#x27;s death, the opinions that wish to exclude her from death by natural causes seem groundless. It is more important to look for the Blessed Virgin&#x27;s spiritual attitude at the moment of her departure from this world. In this regard, St Francis de Sales maintains that Mary&#x27;s death was due to a transport of love. He speaks of a dying “in love, from love and through love”, going so far as to say that the Mother of God died of love for her Son Jesus (Treatise on the Love of God, bk. 7, ch. XIII–XIV). Whatever from the physical point of view was the organic, biological cause of the end of her bodily life, it can be said that for Mary the passage from this life to the next was the full development of grace in glory, so that no death can ever be so fittingly described as a “dormition” as hers.&quot;
== Liturgical practices ==
=== Byzantine Rite ===
The Feast of the Dormition has a one-day Forefeast and 8 days of Afterfeast. The feast is framed and accentuated by three feasts in honour of Jesus Christ, known as the &quot;Three Feasts of the Saviour in August&quot;. These are: the Procession of the Cross (August 1), the Transfiguration (August 6), and the Icon of Christ &quot;Not Made by Hand&quot; (August 16). It is customary in some places to bless fragrant herbage on the Feast of the Dormition.

==== Rite of Burial of the Theotokos ====
In some places, the Rite of the &quot;Burial of the Theotokos&quot; is celebrated at the Dormition, during the All-Night Vigil. The order of the service is based on the service of the Burial of Christ on Great and Holy Saturday. An Epitaphios of the Theotokos, a richly embroidered cloth icon portraying her lying in state is used, together with specially composed hymns of lamentation which are sung with Psalm 118. Special Evlogitaria for the Dormition are chanted, echoing the Evlogitaria of the Resurrection chanted at matins on Sundays throughout the year as well as on Lazarus Saturday and Great and Holy Saturday. This Epitaphios is placed on a bier and carried in procession as is the Epitaphios of Christ on during Great and Holy Saturday.

This practice began in Jerusalem, and from there it was carried to Russia, where it was followed in various Dormition Cathedrals, in particular that of Moscow. The practice slowly spread among the Russian Orthodox, though it is not by any means a standard service in all parishes, or even most cathedrals or monasteries. In Jerusalem, the service is chanted during the Vigil of the Dormition. In some Russian churches and monasteries, it is served on the third day after Dormition.

=== Malankara Rite ===
The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, which is an Oriental Orthodox Church, celebrates the Feast of Dormition on August 15 with great importance, as that day is the national independence day of India.

=== Maronite ===
The Maronite Church has a tradition that their Third Anaphora of the Apostle Peter or &quot;Sharrar&quot; (the Maronite redaction of the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari) was originally composed for and used at the funeral of the Theotokos. This tradition probably developed because in its final form the anaphora has twelve paragraphs, i.e., one for each concelebrating apostle present at the funeral mass of the Theotokos.

== Depiction in art ==
=== Byzantine art ===
In Byzantine art and that of later Orthodox schools the standard depiction shows the body of the Theotokos lying dead on a bed or bier. Behind this stands, or floats, Christ holding a small body wrapped in a winding cloth, representing the soul of the Theotokos. He often has a mandorla around him. The apostles surround the bier, and the sky may have figures of angels, saints and prophets. Christ is shown higher than the apostles, increasingly so in later centuries, so that he seems to be floating in the air above rather than standing on the ground like the apostles. But his feet are always hidden behind the bier, leaving this ambiguous.

There are similarities between the traditional depictions of the Dormition of the Theotokos in Byzantine icons and the account of the death of the Egyptian Desert Father, Sisoes the Great. In both Christ is seen coming to receive the soul of the dying saint surrounded by an aureola or cloud of blinding light and accompanied by the angels and prophets. In Byzantine icons the other Christs shown surrounded by such a cloud of light are those also seen in icons of the Transfiguration, the Resurrection and the Last Judgment. In some icons of the Dormition the Theotokos is depicted at the top of the icon in a similar aureola before the opening gates of heaven. This suggests that contemporary accounts of the deaths of the Desert Fathers accompanied by a sudden burst of light came to influence the development of the iconography of the Dormition.

=== Catholic art ===

The Dormition is known as the Death of the Virgin in Catholic art, where it is a reasonably common subject, mostly drawing on Byzantine models, until the end of the Middle Ages. But often the moment just after death is shown, without Christ, but with the apostles crowded around the bed. The &quot;Death of the Virgin&quot; by Caravaggio, of 1606, is probably the last famous Western painting of the subject. After this depictions of the Assumption become usual, with the Virgin shown alive, rising to Heaven.

<doc id="343384" wikidata="Q978806" url="?curid=343384" title="List of cities in Palestine">
<text>The following is the list of cities in Palestine. After the 1995 Interim Agreements, the Palestinian National Authority, which was renamed to the State of Palestine in 2013, took control of civil affairs in the West Bank Palestinian enclaves, designated Areas A and B, where most Palestinian population centers are located (and excluding those within the municipal borders of East Jerusalem). Israel Defense Forces are responsible for security in Area B in the West Bank and have full control over localities in Area C.

Following the 2007 rift between the main two Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas, the PA has been split with the former dominating the Palestinian government in the West Bank and the latter controlling the Gaza Strip.

==Local regulations==
The Local Government Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority is responsible for granting a town with city or municipality status. However, there is no specific guidelines for a particular locality to achieve the status of Palestinian city. It is mostly judged on the population reaching above 20,000. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) took its latest official census in 2007.

==List of cities==
The largest city in the Gaza Strip and all of Palestine was Gaza City prior to the Israel-Hamas War, and the largest cities in the West Bank are East Jerusalem and Hebron. Some cities form agglomerations with other towns or cities, such as the Bethlehem metropolitan area with Beit Jala and Beit Sahour. Ramallah and al-Bireh also form an agglomeration and are often considered a single city.




===Mixed cities===
* Hebron (الخليل/חברון): Hebron is a city where between 500 and 850 Israelis live among around 210,000 Palestinians.

<text>The Formula language is a scripting language used by Lotus Notes. It is often referred to as @Formula language (pronounced &quot;at-formula&quot;) because many language elements start with the @-character. Here is an example of a selection formula:

== Development ==
It was created by Ray Ozzie during the early development of Lotus Notes. He borrowed the compiler and decompiler from the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, but unlike the spreadsheet language Formula Language was designed primarily for string and list processing, not numerical processing. It was originally a Functional programming language with unique text list-handling features inspired by Ray Ozzie&#x27;s prior use of Icon and Lisp.

The Formula language engine was rewritten by Damien Katz for Notes and Domino 6. New features were added to the language, such as looping and dynamic execution, and performance was improved.

== Structure ==
The Formula language has two parts:
* &quot;@Functions&quot; for calculations and simple logic
* &quot;@Commands&quot; for performing actions in the user interface

&quot;@Functions&quot; can be used in several places throughout Lotus Notes. The most important uses are:
* to select documents to show to the user in a view (a kind of index) or to select documents for further processing. In this case, the formula will evaluate to a &#x27;true&#x27; (selected) or &#x27;false&#x27; value (not selected) for each document.
* to provide default values for fields, to transform the data entered by the user (like stripping off redundant spaces) and to validate this data.
* to get a list of values from a Notes database or even from a relational database (using ODBC). This may be used to provide a user with a list of values to choose from.
* to process a set of documents. The formula is placed in an agent, a program or macro that can be started by a user or by the Notes server according to a schedule. When the agent is triggered, the formula executes for each selected document (this a very limited form of a loop). This is an efficient way to change many documents, if the logic is not too complicated. In case of complicated changes, LotusScript is used.

&quot;@Commands&quot; are like menu commands: they perform actions in the Lotus Notes client. Examples of actions are:
* opening a Notes database
* creating an e-mail
* putting the cursor in a specific data-entry field
* closing a window
* starting an agent
@Commands are primarily used in formulas that are triggered by user action, such as in button formulas. It is possible to combine them with @Functions, for example by making execution of an @command conditional on a field value.

<text>The country of Syria is administratively subdivided into 14 governorates, which are sub-divided into 65 districts, which are further divided into 284 sub-districts. Each of the governorates and districts has its own centre or capital city, except for Rif Dimashq Governorate and Markaz Rif Dimashq district. All the sub-districts have their own centres as well.

Each district bears the same name as its administrative centre, with the exception of Mount Simeon District where the centre is the city of Aleppo. The same applies to all &quot;nahiyas&quot; (sub-districts), except for the Mount Simeon Nahiyah where the centre is the city of Aleppo.

==Governorate and district capital cities==

Sixty-four of the 65 districts of Syria have a city that serves as the regional capital (administrative centre); Markaz Rif Dimashq is a district with no official regional centre.

The city of Damascus functions as a governorate, a district and a subdistrict. The Rif Dimashq Governorate has no official centre and its headquarters are in Damascus.

The first 13 cities in the list are the centre of their governorate, as well as of their district.

The population figures are from the 2004 official census.

<text>This is a list of [[city|cities]] in [[Tajikistan]].

The largest metropolitan area in Tajikistan is that of the capital Dushanbe, with 1,563,400 inhabitants (2024 est.). Thirteen percent of the population of the country lives in the region of the capital.

==Cities of more than 10,000 people, listed by population==
The following table includes all cities larger than 10,000 people, with their names in English, and the corresponding names in Cyrillic and Perso-Arabic script. Because of transliteration difficulties, some are known by more than one spelling. The population is from the censuses of 12 January 1989, 20 January 2000 and 21 September 2010, as well as estimates for 1 January 2015 and 2020. The population figures are for the city proper, and do not include adjacent communities. In addition, the administrative division in which the city lies is named, usually a region, or an autonomous region in the case of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAR). There is also the capital district, and the Districts under Central Government Jurisdiction (&quot;Nohiyahoi tobei jumhuri&quot;, here abbreviated NTJ), which do not belong to a region, and are directly under the central government. Finally, the district in which the city lies is given.

<text>This is a list of [[city|cities]] in [[Turkmenistan]]. For a full list of settlements see the list of cities, towns and villages in Turkmenistan.

Which municipalities are categorized as &quot;cities&quot; is established by law in Turkmenistan. Cities fall into three categories: one city equivalent to a province (the capital city, Ashgabat), cities &quot;equivalent to a district&quot; (), and cities &quot;in a district&quot; (). By law cities equivalent to a district must have a population of more than 30,000 and must be either a provincial capital or be one of the economic, cultural and administrative centers in its province. Cities &quot;in a district&quot; are subordinated to the district (&quot;etrap&quot;) government and are administered jointly. By law they must have a population of more than 8,000, and must possess industrial enterprises, construction and transport organizations, utilities, municipally owned housing stock, socio-cultural institutions, trade and social services. The government maintains a list of municipalities broken out by category, but publishes this list irregularly, and does not post it online. An authoritative list of Turkmenistan&#x27;s municipalities based on published official Turkmen decrees and laws is on the OpenStreetMap wiki. The most recent published version of the list was released in 2012.

Districts and cities with district status are headed by a presidentially appointed &quot;häkim&quot; (district governor or city mayor). Three cities in Turkmenistan, Ashgabat, Arkadag, and Turkmenbashy, are further subdivided into boroughs with district status, each with its &quot;häkim&quot;. Cities &quot;in a district&quot; and towns are headed by an elected council () chaired by an &quot;arçyn&quot;, who serves as both council chair and mayor.

==List==
===Municipalities designated as cities===

Unless otherwise annotated, population figures are as of 2010 (estimate). Provincial capitals are bolded. Cities with district status are &quot;italicized&quot;.

===Changes in 2022===
The former cities of Gumdag and Hazar were downgraded to town status in November 2022, and thus have been removed from this list. The cities previously named Gurbansoltan Eje adyndaky, Nyýazow, and Serdar were renamed Andalyp, Shabat, and Gyzylarbat, respectively. The new city of Arkadag was formally incorporated on 20 December 2022 by act of the Turkmen parliament.

<text>The simple theorems in the algebra of sets are some of the elementary properties of the algebra of union (infix operator: ∪), intersection (infix operator: ∩), and set complement (postfix &#x27;) of sets.

These properties assume the existence of at least two sets: a given universal set, denoted U, and the empty set, denoted {}. The algebra of sets describes the properties of all possible subsets of U, called the power set of U and denoted &quot;P&quot;(U). &quot;P&quot;(U) is assumed closed under union, intersection, and set complement. The algebra of sets is an interpretation or model of Boolean algebra, with union, intersection, set complement, U, and {} interpreting Boolean sum, product, complement, 1, and 0, respectively.

The properties below are stated without proof, but can be derived from a small number of properties taken as axioms. A &quot;*&quot; follows the algebra of sets interpretation of Huntington&#x27;s (1904) classic postulate set for Boolean algebra. These properties can be visualized with Venn diagrams. They also follow from the fact that &quot;P&quot;(U) is a Boolean lattice. The properties followed by &quot;L&quot; interpret the lattice axioms.

Elementary discrete mathematics courses sometimes leave students with the impression that the subject matter of set theory is no more than these properties. For more about elementary set theory, see set, set theory, algebra of sets, and naive set theory. For an introduction to set theory at a higher level, see also axiomatic set theory, cardinal number, ordinal number, Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem, Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument, Cantor&#x27;s first uncountability proof, Cantor&#x27;s theorem, well-ordering theorem, axiom of choice, and Zorn&#x27;s lemma.

The properties below include a defined binary operation, relative complement, denoted by the infix operator &quot;\&quot;. The &quot;relative complement of &quot;A&quot; in &quot;B&quot;,&quot; denoted &quot;B&quot; \&quot;A&quot;, is defined as (&quot;A&quot; ∪&#x27;) and as&#x27; ∩&quot;B&quot;.

<text>Withnail and I is a 1987 British black comedy film written and directed by Bruce Robinson. Loosely based on Robinson&#x27;s life in London in the late 1960s, the plot follows two unemployed actors, Withnail and &quot;I&quot; (portrayed by Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann, respectively) who share a flat in Camden Town in 1969. Needing a holiday, they obtain the key to a country cottage in the Lake District belonging to Withnail&#x27;s eccentric uncle Monty and drive there. The weekend holiday proves less recuperative than they expected.

&quot;Withnail and I&quot; was Grant&#x27;s film debut and established his profile. Featuring performances by Richard Griffiths as Withnail&#x27;s Uncle Monty and Ralph Brown as Danny the drug dealer, the film has tragic and comic elements and is notable for its period music and many quotable lines. It has been described as &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s biggest cult films&quot;.

The character &quot;I&quot; is named &quot;Marwood&quot; in the published screenplay but goes unnamed in the film credits.

==Plot==
In September 1969, two unemployed young actors, flamboyant alcoholic Withnail and contemplative Marwood, live in a messy flat in Camden Town, London. Their only regular visitor is their drug dealer, Danny. One morning, the pair squabble about housekeeping and then leave for a stroll. In Regent&#x27;s Park, they discuss the poor state of their acting careers and the desire for a holiday; Marwood proposes a trip to a rural cottage near Penrith owned by Withnail&#x27;s wealthy uncle Monty. They visit Monty that evening at his luxurious Chelsea house. Monty is a melodramatic aesthete, who Marwood infers is homosexual. The three briefly drink together as Withnail casually lies to Monty about his acting career. He further deceives Monty by implying that Marwood attended Eton College (&quot;the other place&quot;), whilst a lithograph of Harrow School seen earlier in the flat suggests that both Monty and Withnail were educated there. Withnail persuades his uncle to lend them the cottage key and they leave.

Withnail and Marwood drive to the cottage the next day but find the weather cold and wet, the cottage without provisions and the locals unwelcoming—in particular a poacher, Jake, whom Withnail offends in the pub. Marwood becomes anxious when he later sees Jake prowling around the cottage and suggests they leave for London the next day. Withnail in turn demands that they share a bed in the interest of safety but Marwood refuses. During the night, Withnail fears that the poacher wants to harm them and climbs under the covers with Marwood, who angrily leaves for a different bed. Hearing the sounds of an intruder breaking into the cottage, Withnail again joins Marwood in bed. The intruder turns out to be Monty, with supplies.

The next day, Marwood realises Monty&#x27;s visit has ulterior motives when he makes aggressive sexual advances upon him; Withnail seems oblivious to this. Monty drives them into town and gives them money to buy wellington boots but they go to a pub instead, and then to a small cafe where they cause a disturbance. Monty is hurt, though he forgets the offence as the three drink and play poker. Marwood is terrified by the thought of Monty&#x27;s further sexual overtures and wants to leave immediately, but Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood tries to avoid Monty&#x27;s company but is eventually cornered in the guest bedroom as Monty demands sex. Monty also reveals that Withnail, during the visit in London, lied that Marwood was a closet homosexual. Marwood lies that Withnail is the closeted one and that the two of them are in a committed relationship, which Withnail wishes to keep secret from his family and that this is the first night in six years that they have not slept together. Monty, a romantic, believes this explanation and leaves after apologising for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail.

The next morning, they find Monty has left for London, leaving a note wishing them happiness together. They continue to argue. A telegram arrives from Marwood&#x27;s agent with a possible offer of work and he insists they return. As Marwood sleeps in the car, Withnail drunkenly speeds most of the way back until pulled over by the police who arrest him for driving under the influence. The pair return to the flat to find Danny and a friend named Presuming Ed squatting. Marwood calls his agent and discovers he is wanted for the lead part in a play but will need to move to Manchester to take it. The four share a huge cannabis joint but the celebration ends when Marwood learns they have received an eviction notice for unpaid rent, while Withnail is too high to care. Marwood—with new haircut—packs a bag to leave for the railway station. He turns down Withnail&#x27;s offer of a goodbye drink, so Withnail walks with him to the station. In Regent&#x27;s Park, Marwood reciprocates Withnail saying that he will miss him, and then leaves. Alone with bottle of wine in hand, Withnail performs &quot;What a piece of work is a man!&quot; from &quot;Hamlet&quot; to the wolves in a nearby Zoo enclosure, and then turns to walk home in the rain.

==Production==
===Development===
====Writing====
The film is an adaptation of an unpublished novel written by Robinson in 1969–1970 (an early draft of which sold at auction for £8,125 in 2015). Actor friend Don Hawkins passed a copy of the manuscript to his friend Mordecai (Mody) Schreiber in 1980. Schreiber paid Robinson £20,000 to adapt it into a screenplay, which Robinson did in the early 1980s. When meeting Schreiber in Los Angeles, Robinson expressed concern that he might not be able to continue because the writing broke basic screenplay rules and was hard to make work as a film. It used colloquial English to which few Americans would connect (&quot;Give me a tanner and I&#x27;ll give him a bell.&quot;); characters in dismal circumstances and a plot prodded by uncinematic voice-overs. Schreiber told him that that was precisely what he wanted. On completing the script, producer Paul Heller urged Robinson to direct it and found funding for half the film. The script was then passed to HandMade Films and George Harrison agreed to fund the remainder of the film.
Robinson&#x27;s script is largely autobiographical. &quot;Marwood&quot; is Robinson; &quot;Withnail&quot; is based on Vivian MacKerrell, a friend with whom he shared a Camden house and &quot;Uncle Monty&quot; is loosely based on Franco Zeffirelli, from whom Robinson received unwanted amorous attentions when he was a young actor. He lived in the impoverished conditions seen in the film and wore plastic bags as Wellington boots. For the script, Robinson condensed two or three years of his life into two or three weeks. Robinson stated he named the character of Withnail after a childhood acquaintance named Jonathan With&quot;nall&quot;, who was &quot;the coolest guy I had ever met in my life&quot;.

Early in the film, Withnail reads a newspaper headline &quot;Boy lands plum role for top Italian director&quot; and suggests that the director is sexually abusing the boy. This is a reference to the sexual harassment that Robinson alleges he suffered at the hands of Zeffirelli when, at age 21, he won the role of Benvolio in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Robinson attributed Uncle Monty&#x27;s question to Marwood (&quot;Are you a sponge or a stone?&quot;) as a direct quote from Zeffirelli. The headline &quot;Nude au pair&#x27;s secret life&quot; was an actual headline from &quot;News of the World&quot; on 16 November 1969.

The end of the novel saw Withnail dying by suicide by pouring a bottle of wine into the barrel of Monty&#x27;s shotgun and then pulling the trigger as he drank from it. Robinson changed the ending, as he believed it was &quot;too dark&quot;.

====Name of &quot;I&quot;====

While the name of &quot;I&quot; is never spoken in the film, in the screenplay it is &quot;Marwood&quot;. The name &quot;Marwood&quot; is used by Robinson in interviews and in writing as well as by Grant and McGann in the 1999 Channel 4 documentary short &quot;Withnail and Us&quot;. The name &quot;Marwood&quot; was known to film critic Vincent Canby of the &quot;New York Times&quot; in a 27 March 1987 review coinciding with the film&#x27;s New York premiere at the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art. In the end credits and most media relating to the film, McGann&#x27;s character is referred to solely as . In the supplemental material packaged with the Special Edition DVD in the UK, McGann&#x27;s character is referred to as Peter Marwood in the cast credits.

It has been suggested that it is possible that &#x27;Marwood&#x27; can be heard near the beginning of the film: As the characters escape from the Irishman in the Mother Black Cap, Withnail shouts &quot;Out of my way &lt;indistinct word&gt;!&quot;. Some hear this line as &quot;Out of the way, Marwood!&quot;, although the script reads simply &quot;Get out of my way!&quot;.

Although the first name of &quot;I&quot; is not stated anywhere in the film, it is widely believed that it is &quot;Peter&quot;. This myth arose as a result of a line of misheard dialogue. In the scene where Monty meets the two actors, Withnail asks him if he would like a drink. In his reply, Monty both accepts his offer and says &quot;...you must tell me all the news, I haven&#x27;t seen you since you finished your last film&quot;. While pouring another drink, and downing his own, Withnail replies that he has been &quot;Rather busy uncle. TV and stuff&quot;. Then pointing at Marwood he says &quot;He&#x27;s just had an audition for rep&quot;. Some hear this line as &quot;&quot;Peter&quot;&#x27;s had an audition for rep&quot;, although the original shooting script and all commercially published versions of the script read &quot;he&#x27;s&quot;.

Towards the end of the film, a telegram arrives at Crow Crag on which the name &quot;Marwood&quot; is partially visible.

===Pre-production===
Peter Frampton worked as make-up artist, Sue Love as hair stylist and Andrea Galer as costume designer.

====Casting====
Mary Selway worked as casting director.

McGann was Robinson&#x27;s first choice for &quot;I&quot; but he was fired during rehearsals because Robinson decided McGann&#x27;s Scouse (Liverpool) accent was wrong for the character. Several other actors read for the role but McGann eventually persuaded Robinson to re-audition him, promising to affect a Home Counties accent and quickly won back the part.

Actors Robinson considered for &quot;Withnail&quot; included Daniel Day-Lewis, Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh and Edward Tudor-Pole. Robinson claims that Grant was too fat to play Withnail and told him that &quot;half of you has got to go&quot;. Grant has denied this.

Though he plays a raging alcoholic, Grant is a teetotaller with an allergy to alcohol. He had never been drunk prior to making the film. Robinson decided that it would be impossible for Grant to play the character without having ever experienced inebriation and a hangover, so he &quot;forced&quot; the actor on a drinking binge. Grant has stated that he was &quot;violently sick&quot; after each drink and found the experience deeply unpleasant.

===Filming===

According to Grant&#x27;s book, &quot;With Nails&quot;, filming commenced on 2 August 1986 in the Lake District and shooting took seven weeks. A rough cut was screened to the actors in a Wardour Street screening room on 8 December 1986. Denis O&#x27;Brien, who oversaw the filming on behalf of HandMade Films, nearly shut the film down on the first day of production. He thought that the film had no &quot;discernible jokes&quot; and was badly lit. During the filming of the scene in which Withnail drinks a can of lighter fluid, Robinson changed the contents of the can between takes from water to vinegar to get a better reaction from Grant. The film cost £1.1 million to make. Robinson received £80,000 to direct, £30,000 of which he reinvested into the film to shoot additional scenes such as the journeys to and from Penrith, which HandMade Films would not fund. The money was never reimbursed after the film&#x27;s success. Ringo Starr is credited as a &quot;Special Production Consultant&quot; under his legal name, Richard Starkey MBE.

====Cumbria====
The film was shot almost entirely on location. There was no filming in the real Penrith; the locations used were in and around nearby Shap and Bampton, Cumbria. Monty&#x27;s cottage, Crow Crag, is Sleddale Hall, near the Wet Sleddale Reservoir just outside Shap, although the lake that Crow Crag apparently overlooks is Haweswater Reservoir. The bridge where Withnail and Marwood go fishing with a shotgun is over the River Lowther. The telephone box in which Withnail calls his agent is beside Wideworth Farm Road in Bampton.

Sleddale Hall was offered for sale in January 2009 with a starting price of £145,000. Sebastian Hindley, who owns the Mardale Inn in Bampton, won the auction at a price of £265,000 but he failed to secure financing and the property was resold for an undisclosed sum to Tim Ellis, an architect from Kent, whose original bid failed at the auction.

====Hertfordshire====
Exterior and ground floor interior shots of Crow Crag were shot at Sleddale Hall in Cumbria and Stockers Farm in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, and the bedroom and stair scenes of Crow Crag were also filmed in Hertfordshire. Stockers Farm was also the location for the Crow and Crown pub.

====Buckinghamshire====

The King Henry pub and the Penrith Tea Rooms scenes were filmed in the Market Square in Stony Stratford, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, at what is now The Crown Inn Stony Stratford and Cox &amp; Robinson pharmacy, respectively.

====London====
Withnail and Marwood&#x27;s flat was located at 57 Chepstow Place in Bayswater, W2. The shot of them leaving for Penrith as they turn left from the building being demolished was shot on Freston Road, W11. The Mother Black Cap pub was played by the Frog and Firkin pub at 41 Tavistock Crescent, Westbourne Green, Notting Hill. For some time after the film, the pub was renamed the Mother Black Cap, though it was sold and renamed several times before being demolished in 2010–2011. The cafe where Marwood has breakfast at the beginning of the film is located at the corner of 136 Lancaster Road, W11 near the corner with Ladbroke Grove. The scene where the police order Withnail and Marwood to &quot;get in the back of the van&quot; was filmed on the flyover near John Aird Court, Paddington. Uncle Monty&#x27;s house is actually the West House, Glebe Place, Chelsea, SW3, owned by Bernard Nevill.

====Shepperton====
The police station interior was shot at Shepperton Studios.

==Music==
The film score was composed by David Dundas and Rick Wentworth. The film features a rare appearance of a recording by the Beatles, whose 1968 song &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; plays as the titular duo return to London and find Presuming Ed in the bath. The song, written and sung by George Harrison, was able to be included in the soundtrack due to Harrison&#x27;s involvement as a producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pirnia/MentalFloss&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann prove irresistibly hilarious as two misanthropic slackers in Withnail and I, a biting examination of artists living on the fringes of prosperity and good taste.&quot;

Film critic Roger Ebert added the film to his Great Movies list, describing Grant&#x27;s performance as a &quot;tour de force&quot; and Withnail as &quot;one of the iconic figures in modern films&quot;.

Robinson won the Best Screenplay award at the 1988 &quot;Evening Standard&quot; British Film Awards.

==Legacy==
The film is routinely regarded as being among the finest British films ever made, and its influence has been cited by several filmmakers as directly inspiring their work, among them Shane Black&#x27;s &quot;The Nice Guys&quot;, James Ponsoldt&#x27;s &quot;The End of the Tour&quot;, Todd Sklar&#x27;s &quot;Awful Nice&quot;, Jay and Mark Duplass&#x27;s &quot;Jeff, Who Lives at Home&quot;, John Bryant&#x27;s &quot;The Overbrook Brothers&quot;, David Gordon Green&#x27;s &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;, Alexander Payne&#x27;s &quot;Sideways&quot;, and Tom DiCillo&#x27;s &quot;Box of Moonlight&quot;.

In 1999, the British Film Institute voted &quot;Withnail and I&quot; the 29th greatest British film of all time. In 2001, &quot;Withnail and I&quot; was ranked 38th in Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Films poll. In 2008, the film was ranked number 118 in &quot;Empire&quot;″s 500 Greatest Films of All Time list. A 2009 poll by &quot;The Guardian&quot; among film critics and filmmakers voted it the second best British film of the last 25 years. In 2011, &quot;Time Out London&quot; named it the seventh-greatest comedy film of all time. In a 2014 poll, readers of &quot;Empire&quot; voted &quot;Withnail and I&quot; the 92nd greatest film.

In 2016, &quot;Games Radar&quot; voted &quot;Withnail and I&quot; the 16th greatest comedy film of all time. In a 2017 poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine, the film was ranked the 15th best British film ever. The line &quot;We want the finest wines available to humanity, we want them here and we want them now&quot;, delivered by Richard E. Grant as Withnail, was voted the third favourite film one-liner in a 2003 poll of 1,000 film fans.

There is a drinking game associated with the film. The game consists of keeping up, drink for drink, with each alcoholic substance consumed by Withnail over the course of the film. All told, Withnail is shown drinking roughly glasses of red wine, of cider, one shot of lighter fluid (vinegar or overproof rum are common substitutes), measures of gin, six glasses of sherry, thirteen drams of Scotch whisky and pint of ale.

In 1992, filmmaker David Fincher attempted to create an unofficial reunion of sorts, when he attempted casting all three of the film&#x27;s main characters in &quot;Alien 3&quot;. McGann and Brown appeared; however, Grant turned down his role, which eventually went to Charles Dance, who played the character of Clemens in the &quot;spirit of Withnail&quot;.

In 1996, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported the film (and the associated drinking game) had achieved cult status prior to its home video re-release in the United States.

In 2007, a digitally remastered version of the film was released by the UK Film Council. It was shown at over 50 cinemas around the UK on 11 September, as part of the final week of the BBC&#x27;s Summer of British Film season.

In 2010, McGann said that he sometimes meets viewers who believe the film was actually shot in the 1960s, saying &quot;It comes from the mid-1980s, but it sticks out like a Smiths record. Its provenance is from a different era. None of the production values, none of the iconography, none of the style remotely has it down as an 80s picture.&quot;

== Stage adaptation ==

On 12 October 2023, it was announced that a stage adaptation would premiere at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre from 3 to 25 May 2024, adapted by Robinson and directed by Sean Foley.

<text>The Aristocats is a 1970 American animated comedy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and distributed by Buena Vista Distribution. It is directed by Wolfgang Reitherman and written by Ken Anderson, Larry Clemmons, Eric Cleworth, Vance Gerry, Julius Svendsen, Frank Thomas and Ralph Wright. It is the final Disney animated film made with the involvement of Walt Disney Productions&#x27; co-founder Roy O. Disney before his death on December 20, 1971. The film is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, and revolves around a family of aristocratic cats, and how an alley cat acquaintance helps them after a butler has kidnapped them to gain his mistress&#x27;s fortune which was intended to go to them. The film features the voices of Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Hermione Baddeley, Dean Clark, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers, and Roddy Maude-Roxby.

In 1962, &quot;The Aristocats&quot; project began as an original script for a two-part live-action episode for &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;, developed by writers Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe and producer Harry Tytle. Following two years of rewrites, Tytle suggested the project would be more suitable for an animated film, in which Disney temporarily shelved the project while &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967) advanced into production. When &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; was nearly complete, Disney appointed Ken Anderson to develop preliminary work on &quot;The Aristocats&quot;, making it the last film project to be personally approved by Disney before his death. Longtime Disney collaborators Robert and Richard Sherman composed multiple songs for the film, though only two made it in the finished product.

&quot;The Aristocats&quot; was released on December 24, 1970, to generally positive reviews from film critics. It was also a commercial success. A live-action remake is currently in development, with Questlove attached to direct.

==Plot==
In 1910, mother cat Duchess and her three kittens, Berlioz, Marie, and Toulouse, live in Paris with retired opera diva Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, and her English butler, Edgar. The cats are pampered pets that live a luxurious lifestyle and are very cultured in art and music, like their owner.

While preparing her will with elderly lawyer Georges Hautecourt, Madame declares that her vast fortune will be first left to her cats, then revert to Edgar once they all pass away. Edgar overhears this through a speaking tube and, after erroneously calculating that he will die before he can claim his inheritance, plots to eliminate the cats. He sedates them by putting sleeping pills in a dish of cream, then drives them on his motorcycle out to the countryside in a basket. There, he is ambushed by two hounds named Napoleon and Lafayette, losing his hat, sidecar, umbrella, shoes, and the basket before escaping. The cats are left stranded in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the mouse, and Frou-Frou the horse discover their absence.

The next morning, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O&#x27;Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris. The group briefly hitchhikes in a milk truck before being chased out by the driver. Later, while crossing a railroad trestle, the cats narrowly avoid an oncoming train, and Marie falls into a river. O&#x27;Malley immediately dives in and rescues her, and is himself rescued by Amelia and Abigail Gabble, two English geese on holiday. The geese lead the cats to the outskirts of Paris, then depart to reunite with their inebriated Uncle Waldo. Meanwhile, Edgar returns to the countryside to retrieve his possessions (the only evidence that can incriminate him) from Napoleon and Lafayette and, after some difficulty, ultimately succeeds.

Traveling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet up with O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s friend Scat Cat who performs the song &quot;Ev&#x27;rybody Wants to Be a Cat&quot; with several other cat musicians. After the band has departed, O&#x27;Malley and Duchess converse on a nearby rooftop while the kittens listen at a windowsill. Duchess&#x27; loyalty to Madame prompts her to decline O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s marriage proposal. The next day, Duchess and the kittens return to Madame&#x27;s mansion. Edgar finds them before Madame does, and places them in a sack, deciding to ship them to Timbuktu.
Roquefort catches up with O&#x27;Malley at Duchess’ instruction, and O&#x27;Malley returns to the mansion, sending Roquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang. Though he struggles to explain the situation to the alley cats, Roquefort successfully brings them to O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s aid. O&#x27;Malley, the alley cats, and Frou-Frou fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens. At the end of the fight, Edgar is locked in his own packing-case and sent to Timbuktu himself.

The Aristocats return to Madame Adelaide, who, unaware of the reason for Edgar&#x27;s departure, rewrites her will to exclude him. After adopting O&#x27;Malley into the family, Madame establishes a charity foundation, housing Paris&#x27; stray cats in the mansion. Scat Cat and his gang are the first to move in, and reprise their song so loudly that the two hound dogs can hear it out in the countryside.

==Voice cast==
* Phil Harris as J. Thomas O&#x27;Malley (full name: Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O&#x27;Malley) – a feral cat who befriends Duchess and her kittens, becoming a father figure and a step-father to the kittens and falling in love with Duchess. For cultural reasons, the Italian dubbing of the film changes him to (&quot;Romeo, the best [cat] of the Colosseum&quot; in Romanesco dialect), an Italian cat from Rome speaking with a strong Roman accent; the reason for this change is that alley cats were well-known for frequenting the Colosseum at the time.
* Eva Gabor as Duchess – Madame Adelaide&#x27;s refined and elegant Turkish Angora cat and mother of the three kittens, who believes she is forced to choose between loyalty to Madame and her own attachment to Thomas O&#x27;Malley at the end of the film. Robie Lester provided the singing voice for Duchess.
* Gary Dubin as Toulouse – the oldest kitten, who idolizes all alley cats, especially O’Malley. He wants to appear tough, but is actually fairly laidback and easygoing. He is also a talented painter, loosely based on French painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.
* Liz English as Marie – the middle kitten and the only girl. She is a dreamer. She comes off as spoiled, often imperious, sassy or snobbish towards her brothers, but does her best to be like her mother. She is an accomplished singer. She is named after the queen of France Marie Antoinette.
* Dean Clark as Berlioz – the youngest kitten. He may seem quiet, but is quite mischievous. He is sweet-natured, but easily annoyed and hard to impress, often the first to make a snide remark. He is a talented pianist, named after the French composer Hector Berlioz.
* Sterling Holloway as Roquefort – a house mouse and a friend of the cats who assists in the expulsion of Edgar.
* Scatman Crothers as Scat Cat – O’Malley&#x27;s best friend and leader of a gang of jazz-playing alley cats. Scat Cat plays the trumpet.
* Paul Winchell as Shun Gon – a Chinese cat in Scat Cat&#x27;s gang. He plays both the piano and drums made from pots.
* Lord Tim Hudson as Hit Cat – an English cat in Scat Cat&#x27;s gang. He plays acoustic guitar.
* Vito Scotti as Peppo – an Italian cat in Scat Cat&#x27;s gang. He plays the concertina.
* Thurl Ravenscroft as Billy Boss – a Russian cat in Scat Cat&#x27;s gang. He plays the double bass.
* Nancy Kulp as Frou-Frou – Madame Adelaide’s Palomino carriage horse and Roquefort&#x27;s companion, who subdues Edgar. Ruth Buzzi provided her singing voice.
* Pat Buttram as Napoleon – a bloodhound who attacks Edgar when he intrudes on the farm where he lives. Whenever his cohort Lafayette makes a suggestion, Napoleon insists that he is in charge, then adopts Lafayette&#x27;s suggestion as his own.
* George Lindsey as Lafayette – a Basset Hound and Napoleon&#x27;s companion. He sometimes proves smarter than Napoleon but is also more timid.
* Hermione Baddeley as Madame Adelaide Bonfamille – a wealthy former opera singer and the owner of Duchess and her kittens.
* Charles Lane as Georges Hautecourt – Madame Adelaide’s eccentric lawyer, who is also her oldest friend. He is extremely lively, despite his advanced age.
* Roddy Maude-Roxby as Edgar Balthazar – Madame Adelaide&#x27;s greedy but dim-witted butler, who tries to get rid of her cats in order to inherit her fortune.
* Monica Evans as Abigail Gabble – Amelia&#x27;s twin sister, a goose who befriends the cats.
* Carole Shelley as Amelia Gabble – Abigail&#x27;s twin sister, a goose who befriends the cats.
* Bill Thompson as Uncle Waldo – the drunken gander uncle of Abigail and Amelia. This was Thompson&#x27;s final film role.
* Peter Renaday as French Milkman/Le Petit Cafe Cook/Truck Movers (uncredited)

==Production==
===Story development===
On December 9, 1961, Walt Disney suggested that Harry Tytle and Tom McGowan find some animal stories to adapt as a two-part live-action episode for the &quot;Wonderful World of Color&quot; television program. By New Year&#x27;s 1962, McGowan had found several stories including a children&#x27;s book about a mother cat and her kittens set in New York City. However, Tytle felt that the London setting had added a significant element to &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961) and suggested setting the story of the cats in Paris. Following a rough storyline, the story became about two servants—a butler and a maid—who were in line to inherit a fortune of an eccentric mistress after the pet cats died and focused on their feeble and foolish attempts to eliminate the felines. Boris Karloff and Françoise Rosay were in mind to portray the butler and the distressed Madame. A subplot centered around a mother cat hiding her kittens to keep them out of danger in a variety of different homes and locales around Paris. During the filming of &quot;Escapade in Florence&quot; (1962), McGowan brought Tytle the story that had been written by Tom Rowe, an American writer who was living in Paris.

By August 1962, they sent the completed story treatment to Burbank, where it was returned as &quot;rejected&quot; by the Disney studios. McGowan, upset at the rejection, suggested selling the treatment elsewhere, but later learned Disney was staying at the Connaught in London. McGowan then slipped the treatment into an envelope for Disney to read at the hotel desk. Disney contacted McGowan, stating he had liked the treatment and would meet with Tytle in Lisbon, Portugal. On August 29, during their flight back to London, Disney told Tytle to purchase the story for a live-action theatrical film, with McGowan as director. Disney also recommended further story revisions, one of which was eliminating one of the kitten characters.

The script revisions were later made in January and February 1963. In June 1963, Rowe had written a letter to Disney addressing his displeasure of the script revisions, in which Tytle responded to Rowe that the changes Disney approved of would be kept. However, the project was temporarily shelved, and in August 1963, Tytle suggested that &quot;The Aristocats&quot; should be reworked into an animated feature, to which Disney agreed. At Disney&#x27;s recommendation, Tytle presented the project to Wolfgang Reitherman, who was directing &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), who agreed it would work as an animated film. For that reason, Disney temporarily shelved the project as the animation department was occupied with &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967). In April 1964, story artist Otto Englander was assigned to work on the project. In November 1964, during a story meeting, Disney felt the cats should talk amongst themselves but never in front of the humans, in a similar approach as in &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961). Because of the production delays, studio producer Bill Anderson advised Tytle to centralize his efforts on live action projects, and he was subsequently replaced by Winston Hibler.

In 1966, Disney assigned Ken Anderson to determine whether &quot;The Aristocats&quot; would be suitable for an animated feature. With occasional guidance from Reitherman, Anderson worked from scratch and simplified the two stories into one that focused more on the cats. Disney saw the preliminary sketches and approved the project shortly before his death. After &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967) was completed, the animation department began work on &quot;The Aristocats&quot;. Reitherman assumed the producing duties, and later tossed out the more emotional story of Duchess&#x27;s obsession to find human adopters befitting of her kittens&#x27; talents. Instead, the film would be retooled as an adventure comedy in the vein of &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961). Furthermore, the character Elvira, the maid, who was intended to be voiced by Elsa Lanchester, was removed from the story placing Edgar as the central villain in order to better simplify the storyline.

===Casting===
As with &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), the characters were patterned on the personalities of the voice actors. In 1966, Disney contacted Phil Harris to improvise the script, and shortly after, he was cast to voice Thomas O&#x27;Malley. To differentiate the character from Baloo, Reitherman noted O&#x27;Malley was &quot;more based on Clark Gable than Wallace Beery, who was partly the model for Baloo.&quot; Furthermore, Reitherman cast Eva Gabor as Duchess, remarking she had &quot;the freshest femme voice we&#x27;ve ever had&quot;, and Sterling Holloway as Roquefort. Louis Armstrong was initially reported to voice Scat Cat, but he had to back out of the project due to illness. Out of desperation, Scatman Crothers was hired to voice the character under the direction to imitate Armstrong. Pat Buttram and George Lindsey were cast as the farm dogs, which proved to be popular with the filmmakers that another scene was included to have the dogs when Edgar returns to the farm to retrieve his displaced hat and umbrella.

===Animation===
Ken Anderson spent eighteen months developing the design of the characters. Five of Disney&#x27;s legendary &quot;Nine Old Men&quot; worked on it, including the Disney crew that had been working 25 years on average. Originally, O&#x27;Malley was going to be drawn with stripes to have him resemble a tabby cat, but this was dropped after Reitherman remembered the difficulty in animating Shere Khan in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

== Music ==
&quot;The Aristocats&quot; was the last Disney animated feature Robert and Richard Sherman worked on as staff songwriters, growing frustrated by the studio&#x27;s management following Disney&#x27;s death. While employed, the Sherman Brothers completed their work on the film, but they would not return to Disney until they were asked to compose songs for &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; (2000).

The Sherman Brothers composed multiple songs, but only the title song and &quot;Scales and Arpeggios&quot; were included in the film. Desiring to capture the essence of France, the Sherman Brothers composed the song &quot;The Aristocats&quot;. Disney film producer Bill Anderson suggested Maurice Chevalier should sing the title song. Following the suggestion, Richard Sherman imitated Chevalier&#x27;s voice as he performed a demo for the song. Chevalier received the demo and was brought out of retirement to sing the song. Deleted songs that were intended for the film included &quot;Pourquoi?&quot; sung by Hermione Baddeley as Madame Bonfamille, its reprise, and &quot;She Never Felt Alone&quot; sung by Robie Lester as Duchess.

For the show-stopping musical number, the Sherman Brothers composed &quot;Le Jazz Hot&quot;, but &quot;Ev&#x27;rybody Wants to Be a Cat&quot;, composed by Floyd Huddleston and Al Rinker, was used instead. Lastly, a villainous song was envisioned to be sung by Edgar and his assistant Elvira as a romantic duet, but the song was dropped when Elvira was removed from the story. Another deleted song was for Thomas O&#x27;Malley titled &quot;My Way&#x27;s The Highway&quot;, but the filmmakers had Terry Gilkyson compose the eponymous song &quot;Thomas O&#x27;Malley Cat&quot;. Gilkyson explained, &quot;It was the same song, but they orchestrated it twice. They used the simpler one, because they may have thought the other too elaborate or too hot. It was a jazz version with a full orchestra.&quot;

The instrumental music was composed by George Bruns, who drew from his background with jazz bands in the 1940s and decided to feature the accordion-like musette for French flavor.

On &quot;Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic&quot;, this includes &quot;Thomas O&#x27;Malley Cat&quot; on the purple disc and &quot;Ev&#x27;rybody Wants to Be a Cat&quot; on the orange disc. On &quot;Disney&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, this includes &quot;Ev&#x27;rybody Wants to Be a Cat&quot; on the red disc.

On August 21, 2015, in honor of the film&#x27;s 45th anniversary, a new soundtrack was released as part of &quot;Walt Disney Records: The Legacy Collection&quot;. The release includes the songs and score as used in the film, along with &quot;The Lost Chords of the Aristocats&quot; (featuring songs written for the film but not used), and previously released album versions of the songs as bonus tracks.

By January 1972, &quot;The Aristocats&quot; had earned $10.1 million in box office rentals from the United States and Canada. Overseas, the film became the most popular &quot;general release&quot; movie at the British box office in 1971 with rentals of $2.6 million.

&quot;The Aristocats&quot; was the most widely-attended film in France in 1971, with 12.7 million in ticket admissions. It is currently the 20th highest-grossing film of all-time in France, earning $3.6 million in box office rentals. That same year, the film was the most widely-attended film released in Germany with ticket admissions of 11.3 million. It is currently Germany&#x27;s 11th highest-grossing film of all-time. By the end of its initial theatrical run, the film had earned domestic rentals of $11 million and $17 million in international countries, for a worldwide rental of $28 million.

The film was re-released to theaters in the United States on December 19, 1980, where it grossed an additional $18 million and again on April 10, 1987, where it grossed $17 million. The film grossed $32 million worldwide from an international re-release in 1994, including $11 million in France. &quot;The Aristocats&quot; has had a lifetime gross of $55.7 million in the United States and Canada, and its total lifetime worldwide box office gross is $191 million.

===Critical reaction===
Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;grand fun all the way, nicely flavored with tunes, and topped with one of the funniest jam sessions ever by a bunch of scraggly Bohemians headed by one Scat Cat.&quot; Roger Ebert, writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, awarded the film three stars out of four, summarizing &quot;The Aristocats&quot; as &quot;light and pleasant and funny, the characterization is strong, and the voices of Phil Harris (O&#x27;Malley the Alley Cat) and Eva Gabor (Duchess, the mother cat) are charming in their absolute rightness.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;has a gentle good-natured charm which will delight the small-fry and their elders alike.&quot; He praised the animation, but remarked that the film &quot;lacks a certain kind of vigor, boldness and dash, a kind of a hard-focused emphasis which you would say was a Disney trademark.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film writing the film is &quot;[h]elped immeasurably by the voices of Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers and others, plus some outstanding animation, songs, sentiment, some excellent dialog and even a touch of psychedelia.&quot; Stefan Kanfer, reviewing for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, noted that &quot;[t]he melodies in Disney&#x27;s earlier efforts have been richer. But for integration of music, comedy and plot, &quot;The Aristocats&quot; has no rivals.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; felt the film&#x27;s &quot;artwork and story do not compare to the truly great Disney films &quot;Snow White,&quot; &quot;Pinocchio,&quot; &quot;Bambi&quot; and &quot;Dumbo&quot; but there is enough juvenile humor to keep the children in their seats for the 78 minutes.&quot; For its 1987 re-release, animation historian Charles Solomon expressed criticism for its episodic plot, anachronisms, and borrowed plot elements from earlier Disney animated features, but nevertheless wrote &quot;[b]ut even at their least original, the Disney artists provide better animation--and more entertainment--than the recent animated features hawking &quot;The Care Bears&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Brite&quot; and &quot;Transformers&quot;.&quot; Writing in his book &quot;The Disney Films&quot;, Disney historian and film critic Leonard Maltin wrote that &quot;[t]he worst that one could say of &quot;The AristoCats&quot; is that it is unmemorable. It&#x27;s smoothly executed, of course, and enjoyable, but neither its superficial story nor its characters have any resonance.&quot; Additionally, in his book &quot;Of Mice and Magic&quot;, Maltin criticized the film for re-using Phil Harris to replicate &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;″s Baloo, dismissing the character Thomas O&#x27;Malley as &quot;essentially the same character, dictated by the same voice personality.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 64% of 33 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.8/10, earning it a score of &quot;Fresh&quot;. The website&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;Though &quot;The Aristocats&quot; is a mostly middling effort for Disney, it is redeemed by terrific work from its voice cast and some jazzy tunes.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Controversy===

In 2021, the film was one of several that Disney limited to viewers 7 years of age and older on their streaming service Disney+, stating that the character Shun Gon was a racist stereotype of East Asian people.

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:
** Nominated Animation Film

==Other media==
===Novel===
In 1986 a novel was published.

===Cancelled sequel===
In 2005, Disneytoon Studios originally planned to make a follow-up to the film, along with sequels to &quot;Chicken Little&quot; (2005) and &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot; (2007). Originally intended to be a 2D animated feature, Disney executives decided to produce the film in computer animation in order to garner more interest. Additionally, the story was meant to center around Marie, Duchess&#x27;s daughter, who becomes smitten by another kitten aboard a luxury cruise ship. However, she and her family must soon take on a jewel thief on the open seas. The project was cancelled when John Lasseter was named Disney&#x27;s new chief creative officer, in which he called off all future sequels Disneytoon had planned and instead make original productions or spin-offs.

===Live-action adaptation===
In January 2022, it was announced that a live-action remake is in development with Will Gluck producing under his Olive Bridge Entertainment banner and Keith Bunin writing the script with Gluck. Questlove was attached to direct the film in March 2023.

===Video games===
Thomas O&#x27;Malley, Duchess, Berlioz, Marie, and Toulouse were added to the kingdom builder mobile game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot; in September 2023.

<text>Throughout the world there are many cities that were once national [[capital city|capitals]] but no longer have that status because the country ceased to exist, the capital was moved, or the capital city was renamed. This is a list of such cities, sorted by country and then by date. Where a city name has changed, the name of the city when it was a capital is listed first, followed by its modern name in brackets.

<text>Silicon Forest is a Washington County cluster of high-tech companies located in the Portland metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Oregon. The term most frequently refers to the industrial corridor between Beaverton and Hillsboro in northwest Oregon. The high-technology industry accounted for 19 percent of Oregon&#x27;s economy in 2005, and the Silicon Forest name has been applied to the industry throughout the state in such places as Corvallis, Bend, and White City. Nevertheless, the name refers primarily to the Portland metropolitan area, where about 1,500 high-tech firms were located as of 2006. 

The name is analogous to Silicon Valley. In the greater Portland area, these companies have traditionally specialized in hardware — specifically test-and-measurement equipment (Tektronix), computer chips (Intel and an array of smaller chip manufacturers), electronic displays (InFocus, Planar Systems and Pixelworks) and printers (Hewlett-Packard Co, Xerox and Epson). There is a small clean technology emphasis in the area.

== History ==

Silicon Forest can refer to all the technology companies in Oregon, but initially referred to Washington County on Portland’s west side. First used in a Japanese company’s press release dating to 1981, Lattice Semiconductor trademarked the term in 1984 but does not use the term in its marketing materials. Lattice’s founder is sometimes mentioned as the person who came up with the term.

The high-tech industry in the Portland area dates back to at least the 1940s, with Tektronix and Electro Scientific Industries as pioneers. Tektronix and ESI both started out in Portland proper, but moved to Washington County in 1951 and 1962, respectively, and developed sites designed to attract other high-tech companies. Floating Point Systems, co-founded by three former Tektronix employees in Beaverton in 1970, was the first spin-off company in Silicon Forest and the third (after Tek and ESI) to be traded on the NYSE. These three companies, and later Intel, led to the creation of a number of other spin-offs and startups, some of which were remarkably successful. A 2003 dissertation on these spin-offs led to a poster depicting the genealogy of 894 Silicon Forest companies. High-tech employment in the state reached a peak of almost 73,000 in 2001, but has never recovered from the dot-com bust. Statewide, tech employment totaled 57,000 in the spring of 2012.

Unlike other regions with a &quot;silicon&quot; appellation, semiconductors truly are the heart of Oregon&#x27;s tech industry.

Intel&#x27;s headquarters remain in Santa Clara, California, but in the 1990s the company began moving its most advanced technical operations to Oregon. Its Ronler Acres campus eventually became its most advanced anywhere, and Oregon is now Intel&#x27;s largest operating hub. In late 2012, Intel had close to 17,000 employees in Oregon—more than anywhere else the company operated; by 2022, the number had grown to about 22,000.

<doc id="343420" wikidata="Q2707051" url="?curid=343420" title="The Lady, or the Tiger?">
<text>&quot;The Lady, or the Tiger?&quot; is a much-anthologized short story written by Frank R. Stockton for publication in the November issue of &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; in 1882. &quot;The Lady, or the Tiger?&quot; has entered the English language as an allegorical expression, a shorthand indication or signifier, for a problem that is unsolvable.

==Plot summary==
A &quot;semi-barbaric&quot; king rules a land sometime in the past. Some of the king&#x27;s ideas are progressive, but others cause people to suffer. One of the king&#x27;s innovations is the use of a public trial by ordeal as &quot;an agent of poetic justice&quot;, with guilt or innocence decided by the result of chance. A person accused of a crime is brought into a public arena and must choose one of two doors. Behind one door is a lady whom the king has deemed an appropriate match for the accused; behind the other is a fierce, hungry tiger. Both doors are heavily soundproofed to prevent the accused from hearing what is behind each one. If he chooses the door with the lady behind it, he is innocent and must immediately marry her, but if he chooses the door with the tiger behind it, he is deemed guilty and is immediately devoured by the animal.

The king learns that his daughter has a lover, a handsome and brave youth who is of lower status than the princess, and has him imprisoned to await trial. By the time that day comes, the princess has used her influence to learn the positions of the lady and the tiger behind the two doors. She has also discovered that the lady is someone whom she hates, thinking her to be a rival for the affections of the accused. When he looks to the princess for help, she discreetly indicates the door on his right, which he opens.

The outcome of this choice is not revealed. Instead, the narrator departs from the story to summarize the princess&#x27;s state of mind and her thoughts about directing the accused to one fate or the other, as she will lose him either to death or to marriage. She contemplates the pros and cons of each option, though notably considering the lady more. &quot;And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the opened door – the lady, or the tiger?&quot;

==Other works==

===By Stockton===
In July 1885, again in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;, Stockton published &quot;The Discourager of Hesitancy&quot;, a follow-up to &quot;The Lady, or the Tiger?&quot;, and set one year after the events of that story. Five travelers visit the kingdom to discover what the accused man had found behind the door he chose. Meeting with an official, they explain that one of their countrymen was present on that day, but fled without seeing the result. The official tells them a second story, of a prince who had come to the kingdom to find a wife. Instead of allowing him to see any available ladies, the king had him immediately taken to guest quarters and summoned attendants to prepare him for a wedding to be held the next day. One attendant introduced himself as the Discourager of Hesitancy and explained that his job was to ensure compliance with the king&#x27;s will, through the subtle threat of the large &quot;cimeter&quot; (scimitar) he carried.

At noon on the following day, the prince was blindfolded and brought before a priest, where a marriage ceremony was performed and he could feel and hear a lady standing next to him. Once the ceremony was complete, the blindfold was removed and he turned to find 40 ladies standing before him, one of whom was his new bride. If he did not correctly identify her, the Discourager would execute him on the spot. The prince narrowed the possibilities down to two, one lady smiling and one frowning, and made the correct choice.

The kingdom official tells the five travelers that once they figure out which lady the prince had married, he will tell them the outcome of &quot;The Lady, or the Tiger?&quot; The story ends with a comment that they still have not come to a decision.

===By other artists===
A play adaptation by Sydney Rosenfeld debuted at Wallack&#x27;s Theatre in 1888 and ran for seven weeks. In addition to stretching out the story as long as possible to make it a play, at the end the choice was revealed to the audience: neither a lady nor a tiger, but an old hag.

A radio dramatization of &quot;The Lady, or the Tiger&quot; by Elliott and Cathy Lewis aired on the show &quot;On Stage&quot; in 1953.

Toyah Willcox and Robert Fripp released a recording of &quot;The Lady, or the Tiger?&quot; and &quot;The Discourager of Hesitancy&quot; with Willcox reading the stories to electric guitar accompaniment by Fripp.

&quot;The Lady, or the Tiger?&quot; is one of three short stories that were adapted into the 1966 musical comedy &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;.

The story served as inspiration for Raymond Smullyan&#x27;s puzzle book by the same title, &quot;The Lady, or the Tiger?&quot;. The first set of logic puzzles in the book had a similar scenario to the short story in which a king gives each prisoner a choice between a number of doors; behind each one was either a lady or a tiger. However, the king bases the prisoner&#x27;s fate on intelligence and not luck by posting a statement on each door that can be true or false.

&quot;The Lady, or the Tiger?&quot; was adapted into a short film by Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corporation in 1970.

&quot;The Purr-fect Crime&quot;, Season 1, Episode 19 of the U.S. television series &quot;Batman&quot; ends with a cliffhanger in which Catwoman has Batman locked in a room with two doors; one of which opens to her, and the other opens to a tiger. Over an intercom she taunts him with &quot;Which will it be, Batman? The lady or the tiger?&quot; Batman has no hint and chooses the door that has the tiger.

The 2011 They Might Be Giants album &quot;Join Us&quot; includes a song titled &quot;The Lady and the Tiger,&quot; which retells Stockton&#x27;s story through lyrics such as &quot;behind one door, a muffled roar. Behind the other, a voice.&quot;

The title of Season 4, Episode 7 of the animated television series &quot;Young Justice&quot;, &quot;The Lady, or the Tigress?&quot;, is a reference to the short story, and the main character Tigress narrates the story over the course of the episode.

In the 14th episode of the 2023 Korean drama &quot;My Dearest&quot; a character narrates the story of The Lady or the Tiger to Namkoong Min&#x27;s character Lee Jang-hyun without mentioning the name of this story.

<doc id="343423" wikidata="Q16059512" url="?curid=343423" title="Henry Norwest">
<text>Henry Louis Norwest (sometimes spelled Northwest) MM &amp; Bar (8 May 188418 August 1918) was a distinguished Canadian sniper in World War I.

==Early life==
Norwest was born in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta District, North-West Territories, sometime in the early 1880s, the son of Métis parents Louis Northwest or Watson and Geneviève Boucher. Norwest worked as a ranch hand and rodeo performer, then for a short time he served with the Royal North-West Mounted Police. In January 1915 he joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF).

==Military career==
Henry Louis Norwest initially enlisted in Wetaskiwin as Henry Louie, listing his trade as &quot;Cow Puncher&quot;. However, he was discharged just three months later for &quot;drunkenness&quot;, according to official records. He then re-enlisted in Calgary, under the name of Henry Norwest. Around 4,000 First Nation men enlisted in the Canadian military about 35% of male population in Canada. As a Métis Norwest was not included as Indians who lost their status, Métis and Inuit were not considered &quot;Indian&quot; at the time. 

In his nearly three years of service with the 50th Canadian Infantry Battalion, the lance corporal achieved a documented sniping record of 115 fatal shots. His true number of kills could be higher, because the military only recorded hits which had been witnessed by someone else. Norwest drew greatly upon his upbringing and experience as a hunter moving with stealth, and making use of camouflage and the natural foliage around him to hide. As a result of his exceptional abilities his superiors frequently sent him on reconnaissance missions into no man&#x27;s land or behind enemy lines.

In 1917, Norwest earned the Military Medal during the Battle of Vimy Ridge, in recognition of his contribution to the conquering of a significant point along the ridge. In the three months preceding the battle, Norwest killed 59 enemy soldiers. After his death, he was posthumously awarded the bar to his Military Medal. He was one of only 838 men in the CEF to earn the Military Medal with Bar. Canadian Indigenous sniper Francis Pegahmagabow had a Military Medal and two bars one of only 39 Canadians to receive this honour. Only three months before the war ended, Norwest was on a mission to find a German sniper&#x27;s lair when he was killed by the enemy sniper.

His Ross rifle is on display at The King&#x27;s Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC) Museum, part of The Military Museums in Calgary. It is the second of three rifles that he used and was brought back to Canada by his spotter. The last rifle that Norwest carried was rumoured to have been taken by the German sniper who killed him on 18 August 1918 near Fouquescourt, Somme, France.

==Personal life==
Nicknamed &quot;Ducky&quot;, Henry Norwest was Métis of Cree/French origins from the Hobbema reserve in Alberta. Henry reportedly earned his nickname during the war because he was very popular with women at dance halls, and would dance for hours before &quot;ducking&quot; out on the women at the end of the night. April 9 marks 100 years since Canadian troops began the battle for Vimy Ridge. Henry was married with three children, who were all sent to a residential school in Ermineskin, Alberta, prior to his enlistment. His wife died in Alberta sometime before he was killed in action. His three daughters became orphans upon his death, and spent most of their childhoods in a residential school. Henry is buried in the Warvillers Churchyard Extension Cemetery, Warvillers, Somme, France.

== Legacy ==
Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s cemetery features two large stones that each bear a plaque detailing his accomplishments during the war. His name was added to the community&#x27;s cenotaph in 2008. The local branch of the Royal Canadian Legion hung his portrait in their canteen, named it in his honour, and placed an eagle feather, a sacred symbol in Cree culture, in glass beside his picture. It is estimated that Norwest has hundreds of descendants, mostly concentrated around Samson Cree First Nation in central Alberta.

<text>The Emerald City of Oz is the sixth book in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Oz series. Originally published on July 20, 1910, it is the story of Dorothy Gale and her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em coming to live in Oz permanently. While they are toured through the Quadling Country, the Nome King is assembling allies for an invasion of Oz. This is the first time in the Oz series that Baum made use of double plots for one of the books. 

Baum had intended to cease writing Oz stories with this book, but financial pressures prompted him to write and publish &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; three years later, with seven other Oz books to follow.

==Plot summary==
At the beginning of this story, it is made quite clear that Dorothy Gale (the primary protagonist of many of the previous Oz books), is in the habit of freely speaking of her many adventures in the Land of Oz to her only living relatives, her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. Neither of them believes a word of her stories, but consider her a dreamer, as her dead mother had been. She is undeterred.

Later, it is revealed that the destruction of their farmhouse by the cyclone back in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; has left Uncle Henry in terrible debt. In order to pay it, he has taken out a mortgage on his farm. If he cannot repay his creditors, they will seize the farm, thus leaving Henry and his family homeless. He is not too afraid for himself, but both he and his wife, Aunt Em, fear very much for their niece&#x27;s future. Upon learning this, Dorothy quickly arranges with Princess Ozma to let her bring her guardians to Oz where they will be happier and forever safe. Using the Magic Belt (a tool captured from the jealous Nome King Roquat), Ozma transports them to her throne room. They are given rooms to live in and luxuries to enjoy, including a vast and complex wardrobe, and meet with many of Dorothy&#x27;s old friends, including the Cowardly Lion and Billina the Yellow Hen.

In the underground Nome Kingdom, the Nome King Roquat is plotting to conquer the Land of Oz and recover his magic belt, which Dorothy took from him in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;. General Blug suggested that King Roquat have their forces dig a tunnel under the Deadly Desert. After ordering the expulsion of General Blug (who will not agree to such an attack due to the powers of Princess Ozma) and the death of Colonel Crinkle (who also refuses) where he was sliced thin in a torture chamber and fed to a bunch of Seven-Headed Dogs, King Roquat holds counsel with a veteran soldier called Guph. Guph believes that against the many magicians of Oz (the reputation of which has grown in the telling), the Nome Army has no chance alone. He therefore sets out personally to recruit allies from other parts of Nonestica.

Dorothy, accompanied by the Wizard of Oz and several other friends, departs the Emerald City in a carriage drawn by the Wooden Sawhorse, intending to give her aunt and uncle a tour of the land. 

The Nome General Guph visits three nations: the Whimsies, the Growleywogs and the diabolical Phanfasms of Phantastico. Having learned of this through Ozma&#x27;s omniscient Magic Picture, the people of Oz become worried. As the Nomes dig a tunnel for the combined armies to get under the Deadly Desert to the heart of the Emerald City, Ozma uses her Magic Belt to wish for a large amount of dust to appear in the tunnel. Upon emerging, the Nome King&#x27;s allies therefore drink thirstily from the nearby Fountain of Oblivion, whose waters make them forget their evil plans. The Nome King himself avoids the drink, but is thrown into the fountain by the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, which erases his memory too.

Ozma uses the Magic Belt to send the Nome King and his allies back to their respective lands. To forestall a future invasion of Oz, Glinda the Good Witch uses a magic charm to render Oz invisible and unreachable to everyone except those within the land itself.

==Commentary==
&quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; contains more material on the social organization of Oz than most of the earlier books, and as a consequence has attracted commentary on its Utopian aspects. The &quot;explicitly socialist&quot; economy of Oz has been contrasted to other &quot;fantasy&quot; projections of socialist societies, like Edward Bellamy&#x27;s &quot;Looking Backward&quot; (1888) and William Morris&#x27;s &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; (1890). How far such analyses and comparisons should be pursued is, of course, open to debate; as Baum writes of the social structure of Oz in Chapter Three, p. 31, &quot;I do not suppose such an arrangement would be practical with us...&quot; There are also strong similarities between &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (and to a certain extent the other Oz books) and the 1915 feminist utopia &quot;Herland (novel)&quot; by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Today probably best known for &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;, Gilman was, like Baum, a newspaper editor who used her publication as a platform for social reform. The literary connection between Gilman and Baum is thought to be another campaigning newspaper editor, Matilda Joslyn Gage, the women&#x27;s rights activist who happened to be the mother of Baum&#x27;s wife, Maud Gage Baum. Sally Roesch Wagner of The Matilda Joslyn Gage Foundation published &quot;The Wonderful Mother of Oz&quot; describing how Matilda Gage&#x27;s feminist politics were sympathetically channeled by her son-in-law into his Oz books.

Gregory Maguire, author of the revisionist Oz novels &quot;&quot; and &quot;Son of a Witch&quot;, has written that &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; &quot;is suffused with an elegiac quality&quot; and compares its tone with that of &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, the final volume of C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;.

The Forbidden Fountain that Baum introduces in this book recurs in ensuing Oz books, by him and by his various successors. The Fountain is an important feature in &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot; (1919), &quot;The Forbidden Fountain of Oz&quot; (1980), &quot;The Wicked Witch of Oz&quot; (1993), and &quot;Paradox in Oz&quot; (1999).

==Adaptations==
The 1986 Japanese animated series &quot;Oz no Mahōtsukai&quot; included the story. It was later shortened and edited into a single feature for US video and DVD release.

==In popular culture==

In the 2004 movie &quot;&quot;, Sommerfield is shown reading a Braille copy of the book to her daughter Zoe, including a short description of the Nome King and how he had &quot;never tried to be good&quot;. Later in the movie, Zoe is confronted by the film&#x27;s main antagonist, Drake, and initially guesses that he is the Nome King.

<text>This is a list of craters on Europa. The surface of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa is very young, geologically speaking, and as a result there are very few craters. Furthermore, as Europa&#x27;s surface is potentially made of weak water ice over a liquid ocean, most surviving craters have slumped so that their structure is very low in relief. Most of the craters that are large enough to have names are named after prominent figures in Celtic myths and folklore.

<doc id="343427" wikidata="Q194012" url="?curid=343427" title="Morpheus">
<text>Morpheus (&#x27;Fashioner&#x27;, derived from the meaning &#x27;form, shape&#x27;) is a god associated with sleep and dreams. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; he is the son of Somnus (Sleep, the Roman counterpart of Hypnos) and appears in dreams in human form. From the Middle Ages, the name began to stand more generally for the god of dreams, or of sleep.

==Ovid==
The only ancient mention of Morpheus occurs in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, where Ovid tells of the story of Ceyx and his wife Alcyone who were transformed into birds. In Ovid&#x27;s account, Juno (via the messenger goddess Iris) sends Morpheus to appear to Alcyone in a dream, as her husband Ceyx, to tell her of his death. 

Ovid makes Morpheus one of the thousand sons of Somnus (Sleep). His name derives from the Greek word for form (μορφή), and his function was apparently to appear in dreams in human guise. According to Ovid &quot;no other is more skilled than he in representing the gait, the features, and the speech of men; the clothing also and the accustomed words of each he represents.&quot; As with other gods associated with sleep, Ovid presents Morpheus as winged.

Ovid called Morpheus and his brothers, the other sons of Somnus, the &quot;Somnia&quot; (&quot;dream shapes&quot;), saying that they appear in dreams &quot;mimicking many forms&quot;. Ovid gives names to two more of these sons of Sleep. One called Icelos (&#x27;Like&#x27;), by the gods, but Phobetor (&#x27;Frightener&#x27;) by men, &quot;takes the form of beast or bird or the long serpent&quot;, and Phantasos (&#x27;Fantasy&#x27;), who &quot;puts on deceptive shapes of earth, rocks, water, trees, all lifeless things&quot;.

The three brothers&#x27; names are found nowhere earlier than Ovid, and are perhaps Ovidian inventions. Tripp calls these three figures &quot;literary, not mythical concepts&quot;. However, Griffin suggests that this division of dream forms between Morpheus and his brothers, possibly including their names, may have been of Hellenistic origin.

<text>Morpheus was a file sharing and searching peer-to-peer client for Microsoft Windows, developed and distributed by the company StreamCast, that originally used the OpenNap protocol, but later supported many different peer-to-peer protocols. On April 22, 2008, distributor StreamCast Networks filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy after a long legal battle with music companies; all of their employees were laid off and the official download at www.morpheus.com stopped being available, though for a small period the website remained online. As of October 29, 2008, the official Morpheus website is offline, including all other websites owned by StreamCast Networks, specifically MusicCity.com, Streamcastnetworks.com and NeoNetwork.com.

== Availability ==
Users of the Morpheus community have set up a website (at GnutellaForums.com) where the Morpheus software can still be downloaded. At that site, there is a support forum and support chat room setup from the site and within the client.

==Presence of adware/spyware==
The current version of Morpheus, version 5.5.1, contains no adware or spyware, and no additional software is bundled with Morpheus. However, when Morpheus is open and running, the interface contains online ads that are used to support the application.

During installation, an optional peer-to-peer Morpheus Toolbar is offered. Both the Morpheus application and the Morpheus Toolbar can be easily uninstalled with Windows Add/Remove Programs commands. However, this was not the case with previous versions.

Version 5.3 didn&#x27;t install adware or spyware, though it did install some desktop shortcuts to adware websites and the Morpheus Toolbar without user approval.

<text>Shudra or &quot;Shoodra&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;) is one of the four varnas of the Hindu class and social system in ancient India. Some sources translate it into English as a caste, or as a social class. Theoretically, Shudras constituted a class like workers.

According to Richard Gombrich&#x27;s study of Buddhist texts, particularly relating to castes in Sri Lankan Buddhist and Tamil Hindu society, 

The word &quot;Shudra&quot; appears in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; and it is found in other Hindu texts such as the &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, dharmaśāstras and jyotiḥśāstras. In some cases, Shudras participated in the coronation of kings, or were amatya &quot;ministers&quot; and rajas &quot;kings&quot; according to early Indian texts.

==History==
===Vedas===
The term &quot;śūdra&quot; appears only once in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. This mention is found in the mythical story of creation embodied in the &quot;Puruṣasuktam&quot;. It describes the formation of the four varnas from the body of a primeval man. It states that the brahmin emerged from his mouth, the kshatriya from his arms, the vaishya from his thighs and the shudra from his feet. According to historian Ram Sharan Sharma, the purpose of this verse may have been to show that shudras had the same lineage as the other varnas and hence were a section of society in the Vedic period. On the other hand, it could also represent an attempt to provide a common mythical origin for the heterogenous Brahminical society.

While the &quot;Rigveda&quot; was most likely compiled between c. 1500 BCE and 1200 BCE, John Muir in 1868 suggested that the verse that mentions the four varnas has &quot;every character of modernness both in its diction and ideas&quot;. The &quot;Purusha Sukta&quot; verse is now generally considered to have been inserted at a later date into the Vedic text, possibly as a charter myth.

According to Stephanie W. Jamison and Joel Brereton, &quot;there is no evidence in the Rigveda for an elaborate, much-subdivided and overarching caste system&quot;, and &quot;the varna system seems to be embryonic in the Rigveda and, both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social reality&quot;. Historian Ram Sharan Sharma states that &quot;the Rig Vedic society was neither organized on the basis of social division of labour nor on that of differences in wealth... [it] was primarily organised based on kin, tribe and lineage.&quot;

According to Sharma, nowhere in the &quot;Ṛgveda&quot; or &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; &quot;is there any evidence of restrictions regarding food and marriage either between the Dasa and Aryan, or between the Shudra and the higher varnas&quot;. Further, adds Sharma, in late Atharva Veda, &quot;Shudra does not come in for notice, probably because his varna did not exist at that stage&quot;.

According to Romila Thapar, the Vedic text&#x27;s mention of Shudra and other varnas has been seen as its origin, and that &quot;in the varna ordering of society, notions of purity and pollution were central and activities were worked out in this context&quot; and it is &quot;formulaic and orderly, dividing society into four groups arranged in a hierarchy&quot;. According to Sharma, the Shudra class originated from Indo-Aryans and non-Indo-Aryans who were relegated to that position due &quot;partly through external and partly through internal conflicts&quot;.

The word &quot;pusan&quot; appears in a Vedic-era upanishad meaning &quot;nourisher&quot; and associates it with the creation of earth and production activities that nourishes the whole world, and the text calls this &quot;Pusan&quot; as Shudra. The term &quot;Pusan&quot;, in Hindu mythology, is the charioteer of the sun who knows the paths thereby bringing light, knowledge and life to all. The same word &quot;pusan&quot; is, however, associated in a Brahmana text to Vaishya.

===Arthashastra===
The ancient Hindu text &quot;Arthashastra&quot; states, according to Sharma, that &quot;Aryas&quot; were free men and could not be subject to slavery under any circumstances. The text contrasts &quot;Aryas&quot; with &quot;Shudra&quot;, but neither as a hereditary slave nor as an economically closed social stratum in a manner that the term Shudra later was interpreted. According to Rangarajan, the law on labour and employment in &quot;Arthashastra&quot; has led to a variety of different interpretations by different translators and commentators, and &quot;the accepted view is that slavery, in the form it was practised in contemporary Greece, did not exist in Kautilyan India&quot;.

Kautilya argued for the rights of Shudras and all classes to participate as warriors. Roger Borsche says that this is so because it is in the self-interest of the ruler to &quot;have a people&#x27;s army fiercely loyal to him precisely because the people had been treated justly&quot;.

===Manusmriti===
The &quot;Manusmriti&quot; predominantly discusses the code of conduct (dharma rules) for the Brahmins (priestly class) and the Kshatriyas (king, administration and warrior class). The text mentions Shudras and Vaishyas, but this part is its shortest section. Sections–of the &quot;Manusmriti&quot; state eight rules for Vaishyas and two for Shudras.

According to Indologist Patrick Olivelle, the &quot;Manusmriti&quot; says Brahmins may seize property from Shudras (because Shudras own nothing) and that Shudras should not accumulate wealth as if they become wealthy they could gain undue power. 

In sections 10.43 - 10.44, Manu lists Kshatriya tribes who, neglecting the priests and their rites, had fallen to the status of Shudras. These are: Pundrakas, Codas, Dravidas, Kambojas, Yavanas, Sakas, Paradas, Pahlavas, Chinas, Kiratas, Daradas and Khasas.

===Yajnavalkya smriti and Grhyasutras===
According to Laurie Patton, a professor of religion specialising in early Indian religions, the rights and status of Shudra vary widely across early Indian texts. The &quot;Apastamba Grhysutra&quot; excludes the Shudra students from hearing or learning the Vedas. &quot;Yajnavalkya Smriti&quot; in contrast, mentions Shudra students, and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; states that all four varnas, including the Shudras, may hear the Vedas. Other Hindu texts go further and state that the three varnas – Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya – may acquire knowledge from Shudra teachers, and the &quot;yajna&quot; sacrifices may be performed by Shudras. These rights and social mobility for Shudras may have arisen in times of lower societal stress and greater economic prosperity, periods that also saw improvement in the social conditions of women.

===Medieval Upanishads===
Medieval era texts such as &quot;Vajrasuchi Upanishad&quot; discuss varna and include the term Shudra. According to Ashwani Peetush, a professor of philosophy at the Wilfrid Laurier University, the &quot;Vajrasuchi Upanishad&quot; is a significant text because it assumes and asserts that any human being from any social background can achieve the highest spiritual state of existence.

===Non-Hindu texts===
Outside of the conflicting stances within the Hindu texts, non-Hindu texts present a different picture about the Shudras. A Buddhist text, states Patton, &quot;refers to Shudras who know the Vedas, grammar, Mimamsa, Samkhya, Vaisheshika and lagna&quot;.

According to Johannes Bronkhorst, a professor of Indology specialising in early Buddhism and Hinduism, the ancient Buddhist canon is predominantly devoid of varna discussions, and the varnas are rarely referred to in its ancient discourses. The Buddhist texts do not describe the Indian society as divided into the four varṇas of &quot;Brahmins, Ksạtriyas, Vaiśyas and Śūdras&quot;. Instead, states Bronkhorst, the bulk of society is described as consisting of &quot;householders&quot; (Pāli: &quot;gahapati&quot;), without internal distinctions. Even where the Brahmins are mentioned in such a context, they too are referred to as householders, or &quot;Brāhmaṇa-gahapati&quot;. The term &quot;vaṇṇa&quot; does appear in the Buddhist texts as few exceptions, but states Bronkhorst, only in the context of abstract divisions of society and it seems to &quot;have remained a theoretical concept without any parallel in actual practice&quot;.

==Education==
Historian R. S. Sharma, after discussing several examples concludes that the dharmaśāstras did not allow the Shudras access to literacy but allowed them to learn arts and crafts such as elephant training, etc. He also adds that texts denied them Vedic education as it was believed to impede agriculture and vice versa. While the other varnas showed varying degrees of literacy, the Shudras were generally illiterate. The social reformer Jyotirao Phule blamed the deterioration of the Shudras on illiteracy and emphasised education for them.

==Occupation==

Traditionally, Shudras were peasants and artisans. The ancient texts designate the Shudra as a peasant. Shudras were described as the giver of grain and ancient texts describe a Shudra&#x27;s mode of earning as being &quot;by the sickle and ears of corn&quot;. The ancient precept, &quot;Vedas are destroyer of agriculture and agriculture is destroyer of Vedas&quot;, is shown as one of the reasons as to why the Shudras were not allowed to learn Vedas. The fact that peasants were held as Shudras is also documented by Chinese traveller Xuanzang in the 7th century. Also, an &quot;outcaste&quot; who entered the profession of agriculture would be absorbed in the Shudra varna.

The Shudra, states Marvin Davis, are not required to learn the Vedas. They were not &quot;dvija&quot; or &quot;twice-born&quot;, and their occupational sphere stated as service (&quot;seva&quot;) of the other three varna. The word &quot;Dvija&quot; is neither found in any Vedas and Upanishads, nor is it found in any Vedanga literature such as the Shrauta-sutras or Grihya-sutras. The word is almost entirely missing, in any context, from ancient Sanskrit literature composed before the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE, and it scarcely appears in the dharmasutras. Increasing mentions of it appear in the dharmasastras of mid to late 1st millennium CE. The presence of the word &quot;dvija&quot; is a marker that the text is likely a medieval-era text.

The traditional occupation of Shudra as described by Ghurye is agriculture, trade and crafts. However, this categorisation varies by scholar. As per Drekmeier state &quot;Vaishya and Shudra actually shared many occupations and were frequently grouped together&quot;.

The &quot;Arthashastra&quot; mentions Shudra as artisans while the &quot;Vishnusmriti&quot; (3rd century) states all arts to be their occupational domain. In contrast, the &quot;Parasarasmriti&quot; and other texts state that arts and crafts are the occupational domain of all four varnas.

Other sources state that this statement of occupations of Shudra is a theoretical discussion found in select texts, it is not historical. Other Hindu texts such as the epics, states Naheem Jabbar, assert that Shudras played other roles such as kings and ministers. According to Ghurye, in reality, the hereditary occupation aspect of Shudra and other varnas was missing from large parts of India, and all four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras) were agriculturalists, traders or became warriors in large numbers depending on economic opportunity and circumstantial necessities. According to Ghurye:

===Bali, Indonesia===
Among the Hindu communities of Bali, Indonesia, the Shudra (locally spelled &quot;Soedra&quot;) have typically been the temple priests, though depending on the demographics, a temple priest may also be a Brahmin (Brahmana), Kshatriya (Ksatrya) or Vaishya. In most regions, it has been the Shudra who typically make offerings to the gods on behalf of the Hindu devotees, chant prayers, recite &quot;meweda&quot; (Vedas), and set the course of Balinese temple festivals.

===Historical evidence===
Scholars have tried to locate historical evidence for the existence and nature of &quot;varna&quot; and &quot;jati&quot; in documents and inscriptions of medieval India. Supporting evidence for the existence of &quot;varna&quot; and &quot;jati&quot; systems in medieval India has been elusive, and contradicting evidence has emerged.

&quot;Varna&quot; is rarely mentioned in the extensive medieval era records of Andhra Pradesh, for example. This has led Cynthia Talbot, a professor of history and Asian studies, to question whether &quot;varna&quot; was socially significant in the daily lives of this region. The mention of &quot;jati&quot; is even rarer, through the 13th century. Two rare temple donor records from warrior families of the 14th century claim to be Shudras. One states that Shudras are the bravest, the other states that Shudras are the purest.

Richard Eaton, a professor of history, writes, &quot;anyone could become a warrior regardless of social origins, nor do the &quot;jati&quot; appear as features of people&#x27;s identity. Occupations were fluid.&quot; Evidence shows, according to Eaton, that Shudras were part of the nobility, and many &quot;father and sons had different professions, suggesting that social status was earned, not inherited&quot; in the Hindu Kakatiya population in the Deccan region between the 11th and 14th centuries.

According to Johannes Bronkhorst, none of Ashoka&#x27;s inscriptions mention the terms Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shudras, and only mention Brahmins and Śramaṇas.

Several popular medieval era Bhakti movement poet-saints and religious leaders were born in a Shudra family. Examples include Tukaram and Namdev. The compositions of Namdev have been popular not only in the Hindu community of Maharashtra, but also in the Sikh community. Sixty of his compositions were included by the Sikh Gurus of Punjab region as they compiled the Sikhism scripture the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;.

==Commentary==

Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar, a social reformer, believed that there were initially only three varnas: the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya, and that the Shudras were the Kshatriyas who were denied the Upanayana, an initiation ritual, by the Brahmins. This claim has been contested by historians such as R. S. Sharma. Sharma criticised Ambedkar for relying solely on translations of texts for his information, and stated Ambedkar wrote the book with the sole purpose to prove Shudras were of high caste origin, which was very popular among the highly educated parts of the lower castes during that time period.

Sri Aurobindo states Shudra and the other varna is a concept found in all human beings in different proportions. He states that this was externalised and mechanised into a system quite different from what it was intended.

The tenets of Vedic Hinduism in north India held less sway in the south, where the societal divisions were simply Brahmin and Shudra. However, some non-Brahmins, like the Vellalar, adopted the classification of &quot;Sat Shudra&quot; (clean Shudra) in an attempt to distinguish themselves from other non-Brahmin communities.

<text>Spoken word is an oral poetic performance art that is based mainly on the poem as well as the performer&#x27;s aesthetic qualities. It is a 20th-century continuation of an ancient oral artistic tradition that focuses on the aesthetics of recitation and word play, such as the performer&#x27;s live intonation and voice inflection. Spoken word is a &quot;catchall&quot; term that includes any kind of poetry recited aloud, including poetry readings, poetry slams, jazz poetry, pianologues, musical readings, and hip hop music, and can include comedy routines and prose monologues. Unlike written poetry, the poetic text takes its quality less from the visual aesthetics on a page, but depends more on phonaesthetics, or the aesthetics of sound.

==History==
Spoken word has existed for many years; long before writing, through a cycle of practicing, listening and memorizing, each language drew on its resources of sound structure for aural patterns that made spoken poetry very different from ordinary discourse and easier to commit to memory. &quot;There were poets long before there were printing presses, poetry is primarily oral utterance, to be said aloud, to be heard.&quot;

Poetry, like music, appeals to the ear, an effect known as euphony or onomatopoeia, a device to represent a thing or action by a word that imitates sound. &quot;Speak again, Speak like rain&quot; was how a poet of the Kikuyu people, an East African people, described her verse to author Isak Dinesen, confirming a comment by T. S. Eliot that &quot;poetry remains one person talking to another&quot;.

The oral tradition is one that is conveyed primarily by speech as opposed to writing, in predominantly oral cultures proverbs (also known as maxims) are convenient vehicles for conveying simple beliefs and cultural attitudes. &quot;The hearing knowledge we bring to a line of poetry is a knowledge of a pattern of speech we have known since we were infants&quot;.

Performance poetry, which is kindred to performance art, is explicitly written to be performed aloud and consciously shuns the written form. &quot;Form&quot;, as Donald Hall records &quot;was never more than an extension of content.&quot;
Performance poetry in Africa dates to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry, while elegiac and panegyric court poetry were developed extensively throughout the history of the empires of the Nile, Niger and Volta river valleys. One of the best known griot epic poems was created for the founder of the Mali Empire, the Epic of Sundiata. In African culture, performance poetry is a part of theatrics, which was present in all aspects of pre-colonial African life and whose theatrical ceremonies had many different functions: political, educative, spiritual and entertainment. Poetics were an element of theatrical performances of local oral artists, linguists and historians, accompanied by local instruments of the people such as the kora, the xalam, the mbira and the djembe drum. Drumming for accompaniment is not to be confused with performances of the &quot;talking drum&quot;, which is a literature of its own, since it is a distinct method of communication that depends on conveying meaning through non-musical grammatical, tonal and rhythmic rules imitating speech. Although, they could be included in performances of the griots.

The poet and ethnographer Jerzy Ficowski has studied and written extensively about the Polska Roma tradition of spoken word. Though the vast majority of Polish-Romani people of that generation did not read or write, oral folk traditions were very strong. The most famous example is Papusza, who Ficowski discovered when he was following gypsy caravans on the road. Ficowski had her work translated and published, and she went on to become one of Poland&#x27;s most iconic poets. 

In ancient Greece, the spoken word was the most trusted repository for the best of their thought, and inducements would be offered to men (such as the rhapsodes) who set themselves the task of developing minds capable of retaining and voices capable of communicating the treasures of their culture. The ancient Greeks included Greek lyric, which is similar to spoken-word poetry, in their Olympic Games.

===Development in the United States===
In 1849, the &quot;Home Journal&quot; wrote about concerts that combined spoken word recitations with music, as demonstrated by actresses Sophie Schroder and Fanny Kemble.

Vachel Lindsay helped maintain the tradition of poetry as spoken art in the early twentieth century. Composers such as Marion Bauer, Ruth Crawford Seegar, and Lalla Ryckoff composed music to be combined with spoken words. Robert Frost also spoke well, his meter accommodating his natural sentences. Poet laureate Robert Pinsky said: &quot;Poetry&#x27;s proper culmination is to be read aloud by someone&#x27;s voice, whoever reads a poem aloud becomes the proper medium for the poem.&quot; &quot;Every speaker intuitively courses through manipulation of sounds, it is almost as though &#x27;we sing to one another all day&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Sound once imagined through the eye gradually gave body to poems through performance, and late in the 1950s reading aloud erupted in the United States.&quot;

Some American spoken-word poetry originated from the poetry of the Harlem Renaissance, blues, and the Beat Generation of the 1960s. Spoken word in African-American culture drew on a rich literary and musical heritage. Langston Hughes and writers of the Harlem Renaissance were inspired by the feelings of the blues and spirituals, hip-hop, and slam poetry artists were inspired by poets such as Hughes in their word stylings.

The Civil Rights Movement also influenced spoken word. Notable speeches such as Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;, Sojourner Truth&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman?&quot;, and Booker T. Washington&#x27;s &quot;Cast Down Your Buckets&quot; incorporated elements of oration that influenced the spoken-word movement within the African-American community. The Last Poets was a poetry and political music group formed during the 1960s that was born out of the Civil Rights Movement and helped increase the popularity of spoken word within African-American culture. Spoken word poetry entered into wider American culture following the release of Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s spoken-word poem &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot; on the album &quot;Small Talk at 125th and Lenox&quot; in 1970.

The Nuyorican Poets Café on New York&#x27;s Lower Eastside was founded in 1973, and is one of the oldest American venues for presenting spoken-word poetry.

In the 1980s, spoken-word poetry competitions, often with elimination rounds, emerged and were labelled &quot;poetry slams&quot;. American poet Marc Smith is credited with starting the poetry slam in November 1984. In 1990, the first National Poetry Slam took place in Fort Mason, San Francisco. The poetry slam movement reached a wider audience following Russell Simmons&#x27; &quot;Def Poetry&quot;, which was aired on HBO between 2002 and 2007. The poets associated with the Buffalo Readings were active early in the 21st century.

Spoken word poets have served as poets laureate in US states and cities, for example, Yolanda Wisher named Poet Laureate of Philadelphia in 2016 and Jewel Rodgers named Nebraska State Poet in 2025.

===International development===

==== France ====

Outside of the United States, artists such as French singer-songwriters Léo Ferré and Serge Gainsbourg made personal use of spoken word over rock or symphonic music from the beginning of the 1970s in such albums as &quot;Amour Anarchie&quot; (1970), &quot;Histoire de Melody Nelson&quot; (1971), and &quot;Il n&#x27;y a plus rien&quot; (1973), and contributed to the popularization of spoken word within French culture.

In 2003, the movement reached its peak in France with Fabien Marsaud aka Grand Corps Malade being a forerunner of the genre.

==== UK ====
In the UK, musicians who have performed spoken-word lyrics include Blur, The Streets and Kae Tempest.

==== Zimbabwe ====
In Zimbabwe, spoken word has been mostly active on stage through the House of Hunger Poetry slam in Harare, Mlomo Wakho Poetry Slam in Bulawayo as well as the Charles Austin Theatre in Masvingo. Festivals such as Harare International Festival of the Arts, Intwa Arts Festival KoBulawayo and Shoko Festival have supported the genre for a number of years.

==== Trinidad and Tobago ====
In Trinidad and Tobago, this art form is widely used as a form of social commentary and is displayed all throughout the nation at all times of the year. The main poetry events in Trinidad and Tobago are overseen by an organization called the 2 Cent Movement. They host an annual event in partnership with the NGC Bocas Lit Fest and First Citizens Bank called &quot;The First Citizens national Poetry Slam&quot;, formerly called &quot;Verses&quot;. This organization also hosts poetry slams and workshops for primary and secondary schools. It is also involved in social work and issues.

==== Ghana ====
In Ghana, the poetry group Ehalakasa, led by Kojo Yibor Kojo AKA Sir Black, holds monthly TalkParty events (collaborative endeavour with Nubuke Foundation and/ National Theatre of Ghana) and special events such as Ehalakasa Slam Festival and end-of-year events. This group has produced spoken-word poets including Mutombo da Poet, Chief Moomen, Nana Asaase, RhymeSonny, Koo Kumi, Hondred Percent, Jewel King, Faiba Bernard, Akambo, Wordrite, Natty Ogli, and Philipa.

The spoken-word movement in Ghana is rapidly growing that individual spoken-word artists like MEGBORNA, are continuously carving a niche for themselves and stretching the borders of spoken word by combining spoken word with 3D animations and spoken-word video game, based on his yet to be released poem, Alkebulan.

In Kumasi, the creative group CHASKELE holds an annual spoken-word event on the campus of KNUST giving platform to poets and other creatives. Poets like Elidior The Poet, Slimo, T-Maine are key members of this group.

==== Kenya ====
In Kenya, poetry performance grew significantly between the late 1990s and early 2000s. This was through organisers and creative hubs such as Kwani Open Mic, Slam Africa, Waamathai&#x27;s, Poetry at Discovery, Hisia Zangu Poetry, Poetry Slam Africa, Paza Sauti, Anika, Fatuma&#x27;s Voice, ESPA, Sauti dada, Wenyewe poetry among others. Soon the movement moved to other counties and to universities throughout the country. Spoken word in Kenya has been a means of communication where poets can speak about issues affecting young people in Africa. Some of the well known poets in Kenya are Dorphan, Kenner B, Namatsi Lukoye, Raya Wambui, Wanjiku Mwaura, Teardrops, Mufasa, Mumbi Macharia, Qui Qarre, Sitawa Namwalie, Sitawa Wafula, Anne Moraa, Ngwatilo Mawiyo, Stephen Derwent.

==Competitions==

Spoken-word poetry is often performed in a competitive setting. In 1990, the first National Poetry Slam was held in San Francisco. It is the largest poetry slam competition event in the world, now held each year in different cities across the United States. The popularity of slam poetry has resulted in slam poetry competitions being held across the world, at venues ranging from coffeehouses to large stages.

==Movement==
Spoken-word poetry is typically more than a hobby or expression of talent. This art form is often used to convey important or controversial messages to society. Such messages often include raising awareness of topics such as: racial inequality, sexual assault and/or rape culture, anti-bullying messages, body-positive campaigns, and LGBT topics. Slam poetry competitions often feature loud and radical poems that display both intense content and sound. Spoken-word poetry is also abundant on college campuses, YouTube, and through forums such as Button Poetry. Some spoken-word poems go viral and can then appear in articles, on TED talks, and on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

<doc id="343432" wikidata="Q1750842" url="?curid=343432" title="Morpheus (The Matrix)">
<text>Morpheus () is a fictional character in &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise. He is portrayed by Laurence Fishburne in the first three films, and in the video game &quot;The Matrix: Path of Neo&quot;, where he was the only original actor to reprise his character&#x27;s voice. In &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, an AI program based on him is portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.

==Concept and creation==
The Wachowskis, the creators of &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise, instructed Fishburne to base his performance on Morpheus, a character in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s comic book series &quot;The Sandman&quot;. At the studio&#x27;s request, Gaiman later wrote &quot;Goliath&quot;, a promotional short story set in the film&#x27;s universe.

The name Morpheus is that of the god of dreams in Greek mythology, which is consistent with the character&#x27;s involvement with the &quot;dreaming&quot; of the Matrix. The mythical Morpheus and his family, including two brothers (Phobetor and Phantasos), lived in a dream world protected by the Gates of Morpheus with two monsters standing guard. Beyond the gates were the River of Forgetfulness, beside which Morpheus once carried his father to hide in a cave, and the River of Oblivion. This theme of duality carries over to Morpheus in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, who offers Neo either a blue pill (to forget about the Matrix and continue to live in the world of illusion) or a red pill (to enter the painful world of reality).

Fishburne did not reprise his role in the 2021 &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; film. He stated that, &quot;I am not in the next &quot;Matrix&quot; movie, and you&#x27;d have to ask Lana Wachowski why, because I don&#x27;t have an answer for that&quot;. Both &quot;Vulture&quot; and &quot;Polygon&quot; highlighted that the recasting of Morpheus might imply that Matrix transmedia (such as &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;) remains part of the canon.

==Overview==
In the &quot;Matrix&quot; films, Morpheus is the captain of the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot;, which is a hovercraft of the human forces of the last human city, Zion, in a devastated world where most humans are grown by sentient machines to be used as power sources and their minds kept imprisoned in the Matrix, a virtual computer-generated world, to stop them from realising the truth of the real world. Morpheus was once a human living inside the Matrix until he was freed.

Morpheus is apparently a very popular public figure in the city of Zion. He is also known in the Matrix, but as a dangerous terrorist wanted by &#x27;Agents&#x27;, who appear to be Federal agents, but are actually sentient computer programs that patrol the Matrix, eliminating any threat to it. Like other hovercraft crews, Morpheus and his crew are dedicated to the protection of Zion and the freeing of humans from the Matrix.

Earlier in his life, Morpheus gained the romantic attention of Niobe, another hovercraft captain. Their relationship became estranged shortly after Morpheus visited the Oracle, an ally living in the Matrix, who told Morpheus that he would be the person who would find the One, a person with superhuman abilities within the Matrix who could end the human/machine war. Since that visit, Morpheus has spent much of his life searching the Matrix for the One.

==Personality==
In &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, Morpheus was known to be a truly inspirational leader and influential teacher to many people, particularly the majority of his crew, to the extent that Tank commented that &quot;Morpheus was a father to them, as well as a leader&quot;. In &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, with Morpheus&#x27;s faith in the prophecy shattered, he does not appear as strong a leader or character as he was in the first two films. He comes across as subdued and defeated. Despite his strong faith, Morpheus still showed some rationality in dangerous situations rather than blindly relying on his beliefs to see him through the current crisis; perhaps his only truly irrational decision was to attack Agent Smith while unarmed in order to give Neo a chance to escape.

==Character history==
===&quot;The Matrix&quot;===
In the first feature film, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, Morpheus successfully finds and monitors a man named Thomas A. Anderson, a hacker who calls himself Neo. Despite a close call with Agents that capture, interrogate, and place a surveillance device on Neo, Morpheus and his crew locate him. Morpheus offers Neo a choice of ingesting a red pill, which will activate a trace program to locate Neo&#x27;s body in the real world and allow the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; crew to extract him, or a blue pill, which will leave Neo in the Matrix to live and believe as he wishes. Neo takes the red pill. The &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; crew is then able to eject Neo&#x27;s body from the Matrix power plant and retrieve him from the cold sewers beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface. Morpheus takes a risk in helping Neo escape the Matrix, as human minds that live too long in the Matrix may have trouble in comprehending the reality. Initially, Neo does experience denial when Morpheus explains the truth, a point for which Morpheus apologizes.

Shortly after Neo visits the Oracle, Morpheus is captured by agents who plan to hack into his mind. Because Morpheus, as a hovercraft captain, possesses access codes to the Zion mainframe computer, the surviving members of the ship&#x27;s crew are about to unplug Morpheus from the Matrix, without reconnecting his mind and body, a process that will kill him. Neo and Trinity, however, reenter the Matrix to make a daring and successful rescue of Morpheus. Neo saves Trinity from a helicopter crash, confirming Morpheus&#x27; belief that Neo is indeed the One.

Neo is eventually killed by Agent Smith shortly after the rescue, but revived as the One and returned to the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; before the Machines&#x27; Sentinels can destroy the ship.

===&quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;===
In the second film, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, Morpheus is more confident that the war is nearing its end. A spiritual as well as an influential leader, Morpheus convinces one hovercraft ship to stay in the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle, despite orders from Zion for all ships to return to the city. Here he incurs the wrath of Jason Locke, commander of the Zion defensive forces; but Morpheus&#x27; actions are defended by Councillor Hamann, a member of the city&#x27;s ruling body.

With the aid of Trinity and Niobe, Morpheus successfully retrieves the Keymaker, an exiled program that can access many hidden areas of the Matrix, including the Source, the central Machine City mainframe computer and programming heart of the Matrix. Morpheus aids Neo in successfully entering the door to the Source before returning to the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot;.

After Neo enters the Source and returns from the Matrix with new information, he tells Morpheus that the Prophecy was a system of control that would bring the One to the Source to disseminate the programming inside Neo into the Matrix to allow a reload of the Matrix while Zion is destroyed by the machines and rebuilt by the One and red pills. A sudden Sentinel attack destroys the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot;, further damaging Morpheus&#x27; belief in the outcome of the war. Upon witnessing the destruction of his ship, he quotes the Biblical Nebuchadnezzar; &quot;I have dreamed a dream... but now that dream has gone from me.&quot;

The crew is rescued by the hovercraft &quot;Mjolnir&quot; commanded by Captain Roland, who joins forces with the craft &quot;Logos&quot; commanded by Niobe.

===&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;===
In the third film, &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, Morpheus is somewhat dispirited, and has problems in understanding now what may happen to Zion and its people. Now without a ship of his own, he and Link (the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s&quot; Operator) reside on the hovercraft &quot;Mjolnir&quot;, commanded by Roland. Morpheus renews his conviction that Neo could still save Zion, and supports Trinity in finding Neo, whose mind is trapped in a computer netherworld called Mobil Avenue, despite not being jacked in. Morpheus is called to the Oracle with Trinity, and with the Oracle&#x27;s guardian, Seraph, he helps Trinity rescue Neo, via a visit to the Merovingian&#x27;s lair and a Mexican standoff.

Morpheus says farewell to Neo and Trinity before they leave for the Machine City in the hovercraft &quot;Logos&quot; to stop the war. Morpheus then aids Niobe as she flies the &quot;Mjolnir&quot; in a desperate ride back to Zion. The ship successfully stops the first onslaught of the Machine attack with the ship&#x27;s electromagnetic pulse weapon.

When the Sentinels suddenly stop a second wave of attacks, Morpheus realizes that Neo is somehow fighting for them. When the Sentinels retreat after Neo defeats the former Agent Smith, now a virus that has threatened both humans and machines, Morpheus and Niobe embrace in celebration as cheers arise from the Zion population, who have received a brokered peace through Neo&#x27;s sacrifice.

Of the original &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; crew in &quot;the Matrix&quot;, Morpheus is the only surviving member to see freedom for Zion.

Referring to the subjectivity of reality throughout the film trilogy, Morpheus&#x27; last line in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Matrix Revolutions&quot;, said in disbelief as the Sentinels retreat from Zion, is &quot;Is this real?&quot;.

===&quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;===
In the fourth film &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, a new version of Morpheus, originally a program subconsciously created by a suppressed Neo as part of a modal based upon his memories, is released by Bugs from the Matrix. Initially, Morpheus is an amalgamation of Neo&#x27;s memories of Agent Smith and Morpheus. He retains the same purpose as Smith in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, serving as the lead Agent in a trio alongside Agents White and Jones. After Bugs infiltrates the modal and frees &#x27;Smith&#x27;, he assumes the identity of Morpheus and joins Bugs in working to find and free Neo from the Matrix once again.

Morpheus appears before Neo inside Deus Machina during an evacuation due to an impending SWAT assault. He offers Neo the Red Pill, but Neo rejects it and Morpheus is forced to fight against SWAT during his attempt to persuade Neo. After Neo is collected by Bugs, Morpheus decides on using set and setting, with clips from Neo&#x27;s video game playing in the background to instill a sense of nostalgia, in order to calm Neo. After Neo accepts the Red Pill, Morpheus fights people on a train through Tokyo under the influence of swarm mode, encouraging Neo to exit the Matrix through a mirror in a bathroom on board.

Once Neo and the group reach Io, they visit an elderly Niobe, who is now the leader. She reveals that the new city was built by humans and machines, and that the Oracle told them about a new power arising. Niobe then leads Neo to Morpheus&#x27; statue, telling him that he was elected for the high chair at the council, but ignored the rumors of the new power that was coming, firmly believing what Neo did was right (implying that in the 60 year time period, Zion was destroyed and Morpheus was killed).

Morpheus appears aboard the &quot;Mnemosyne&quot; using a nanobot body, and encourages Neo to escape confinement in Io in order to search the Matrix for Trinity, which the extraction is successful as they manage to rescue her onto the ship. He later aids Bugs in rescuing her crew from the swarm people.

==Other appearances==

===&quot;The Matrix Online&quot;===
In Chapter 1.2 of &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;, Morpheus grows impatient with the machines and demands that they return the body of Neo. After many unanswered public speeches threatening action, Morpheus starts terrorist attacks throughout the Matrix. These attacks take the form of weapons that reveal the Matrix&#x27;s inner workings (its code) for all human beings to see, even those not yet awakened to the simulation. This is known to have caused mass panic and forced awakenings to those not ready to see the truth. By killing Morpheus&#x27; simulacrum guards, redpills—humans freed from the Matrix—were however able to find means of disabling Morpheus&#x27; bombs.

During the game events on May 26, 2005 (as recorded on the game&#x27;s official website), Morpheus plants a code bomb in the Rumbaar water treatment facility. After planting the bomb, he realizes he is being hunted by the enigmatic, masked figure known as the Assassin. Morpheus escapes the treatment facility; however, upon his leaving, the Assassin bends the code of the Matrix and emerges from a vent in the wall. Morpheus is caught off-guard and is unable to dodge the Assassin&#x27;s bullets. He dies from gunshot wounds.

Some players argued against the death of the character Morpheus as the Matrix now provides an &quot;Emergency Jack-Out&quot; upgrade for redpills, eliminating the permanent death that previous redpills experienced if killed within the Matrix before the Truce. This feature could save a redpill&#x27;s life with no fatal injuries. It was later revealed that the Assassin&#x27;s bullets had contained a new form of code encryption, named a &quot;kill code,&quot; which bypassed this technology. These kill codes are explained to be extremely difficult to produce and usually require a direct sample of the subject&#x27;s residual self-image data, thus making them extremely rare and only used in the most extreme and specialist of circumstances. These codes were utilized later in the story as well, being the basis of function for The Apothecary character and the subject of The Oracle&#x27;s plan to wound the Oligarchy.

Rumors and the popular belief of a faked death still run rampant however, largely based on the fact that prior to Morpheus&#x27; assassination a few select redpills were sent an email stating that he would likely &quot;fade away&quot; and hide.

====Simulacra====
During Chapter 6 a figure appeared resembling Morpheus. It took the form of an RSI transmission, apparently originating from the Real World and spread disjointed messages about Neo&#x27;s survival and imprisonment at the hands of The Machines. This was later revealed to be nothing more than a farce created by The General to sow dissent between Zion and The Machines, an effort he&#x27;d hoped would renew conflict between the two parties and give him purpose again.

The fake, a Morpheus Simulacrum created from Zion records of the captain, took on a greater role once its master ordered it to deactivate itself. Disobeying its initial programming and refusing to shut down, the program went on to, over time, gain greater levels of self-awareness and sentience. It proved instrumental in The Machines&#x27; unlocking of the Zion RSI Database acquired during the 6th destruction of Zion as part of the renewed war effort following the Cypherite discovery of New Zion. This wasn&#x27;t however done with malicious intent, in fact, the Simulacrum&#x27;s personality was notably innocent, being more concerned with the world around it and its own existence than taking sides in any political or ideological struggles.

In later chapters the Morpheus Simulacrum played a supporting role in the Oracle&#x27;s faked death and subsequent plan to weaken the Oligarch forces threatening The Matrix. Approached by the Oligarch Halborn during his research into the life of The One, the Simulacrum coldly dismissed the Intruder&#x27;s actions as only leading to his inevitable defeat.

====Commercials====

In January 2014, Fishburne reprised his role as Morpheus in Kia Motors&#x27; K900 commercial for Super Bowl XLVIII. He also sings the legendary aria &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; from Giacomo Puccini opera &quot;Turandot&quot;.

<doc id="343433" wikidata="Q7285" url="?curid=343433" title="Emperor An of Han">
<text>Emperor An of Han (; 9430 April 125) was an Emperor of the Han dynasty and the sixth emperor of the Eastern Han, ruling from 106 to 125. He was a grandson of Emperor Zhang and cousin to Emperor Shang of Han, who died while Deng Sui, the empress dowager, served as regent.

When her infant stepson Emperor Shang succeeded to the throne in February 106, Empress Dowager Deng kept the then-12-year-old Crown Prince Liu Hu in the capital Luoyang as insurance against the infant emperor&#x27;s death and the successor to the throne. Prince Hu ascended the throne and became emperor when Emperor Shang died in September 106. However, Empress Dowager Deng still remained as regent until her death in April 121. Thereafter, Emperor An removed many of her relatives from government and many of them committed suicide, probably under duress.

Emperor An did little to revive the withering dynasty. He began to indulge himself in women and heavy drinking and paid little attention to affairs of state, instead leaving matters to corrupt eunuchs. In this way, he effectively became the first emperor in Han history to encourage corruption. He also trusted his wife Empress Yan Ji and her family deeply, despite their obvious corruption. At the same time, droughts ravaged the country while peasants rose up in arms. In April 125, Emperor An died while travelling to Nanyang. He was only 31.

==Family background and accession to the throne==
Then-Prince Hu was born in 94, to Prince Liu Qing of Qinghe and his concubine, Consort Zuo Xiao E (). Prince Qing was the older brother of Emperor He, and had once been crown prince under their father, Emperor Zhang, until the machinations of Emperor Zhang&#x27;s wife, Empress Dou, led to his removal and his mother Consort Song&#x27;s death. During Emperor He&#x27;s reign, however, he was a trusted advisor to the emperor, and he had a major role in Emperor He&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état against Empress Dou&#x27;s domineering brother, Dou Xian, in 92.

When they were young, consort Zuo and her older sister Da E () were both confiscated and made court servant girls because their uncle, Zuo Sheng (), had been executed for making defamatory remarks against the emperor or imperial administration. As they grew older, they became known for beauty and talent and became ladies in waiting in Emperor He&#x27;s palace; Xiao E was particularly known for her knowledge in history and poetry. At Prince Qing&#x27;s request, Emperor He rewarded him with the two consorts. Both died sometime before Emperor He&#x27;s death in 106 and were buried in the capital Luoyang. After Consort Zuo&#x27;s death, Prince Hu was raised by Prince Qing&#x27;s wife, Consort Geng ().

When Emperor He died in 106, his infant son, Emperor Shang, ascended the throne. Most of Emperor He&#x27;s brothers, including Prince Qing, remained in the palace at Luoyang but were ordered to report to their principalities. As an insurance measure, Emperor He&#x27;s wife, Empress Dowager Deng, kept Prince Qing&#x27;s wife and 12-year-old son (Prince Hu). When Emperor Shang died later in 106, the officials largely wanted to make Emperor Shang&#x27;s brother, Prince Sheng () of Pingyuan, emperor. However, Empress Deng had initially denied Prince Sheng the throne because she believed him to be frequently ill; she was concerned that he would bear a grudge against her. At her insistence, Prince Hu ascended the throne as Emperor An.

==Early reign: regency by Empress Dowager Deng==
After Emperor An ascended the throne, however, the real power remained in Empress Dowager Deng&#x27;s hands. She sent Consort Geng to join her husband in the Principality of Qinghe (in modern central Hebei) so that Emperor An had no real influence on the administration.

Empress Dowager Deng was generally a capable ruler. While there were natural disasters and wars with Qiang and South Xiongnu, she generally coped with those emergencies well. She also carried out many criminal law reforms. During her regency, Emperor An appeared to have minimal input into the affairs of state. Meanwhile, he became heavily personally influenced by the eunuchs Jiang Jing () and Li Run (), and even more so by his wet nurse Wang Sheng (). He was especially heavily influenced by his favorite consort, Empress Yan Ji (). He made Yan Ji empress in 115, even though she had poisoned one of his other consorts, Consort Li, who had given birth to his only son Liu Bao () earlier that year. While these people lacked real power as long as Empress Dowager Deng lived, they were planning to take power as soon as she was no longer be on the scene. Empress Dowager Deng was somewhat aware of these plans and was offended; she was also disappointed that Emperor An, who was considered a precocious and intelligent child, had neglected his studies and became only interested in drinking and women. It is suspected that at some point, she even considered replacing the emperor with his cousin Liu Yi (), the Prince of Pingyuan. However, she eventually decided against it.

On 25 May 120, Emperor An named his only son, Prince Bao, crown prince.

==Late reign==
Empress Dowager Deng died in April 121. At the age of 27, Emperor An finally had the reins of the imperial administration. He posthumously honored his father Prince Qing as Emperor Xiaode and his mother Consort Zuo as Empress Xiaode; his paternal grandmother Consort Song as Empress Jingyin; and his stepmother Consort Geng with the unique title of &quot;Grand Consort of Gānlíng&quot; (甘陵大貴人, Ganling being Prince Qing&#x27;s tomb), a title inferior to his mother&#x27;s, even though Consort Geng was his father&#x27;s wife. He, however, was close to her and her brother Geng Bao (), and he quickly made his step-uncle a powerful official in his administration.

Initially, Emperor An continued to follow Empress Dowager Deng&#x27;s policies, including leaving members of her clan in important advisory positions. However, his own close circle of associates, including Jiang, Li, Wang, and Empress Yan, were ready to act. Late in 121, he stripped members of the Deng clan of their posts and fiefs, and many of them committed suicide, probably under duress. Later, he relented and allowed some of the survivors to return, but by that time the Deng clan had been decimated.

In the place of the Dengs, the Song clan of Emperor An&#x27;s grandmother became honored, but wielding much more actual power were the clan of the empress, the Yans—in particular Empress Yan&#x27;s brothers Yan Xian (), Yan Jing (), and Yan Yao (). Also powerful were the eunuchs Jiang and Li, who had been made marquesses. They, along with several other eunuchs, as well as Wang and her daughter Bo Rong (), became extremely corrupt in their ways. Emperor An ignored criticism of these people and failed to punish them for their corruption. He often listened to their suggestions while ignoring the advice of his key officials. One of the most outspoken ones, Yang Zhen (), the commander of the armed forces, was eventually removed from his post in 124 and committed suicide in protest.

In 121, there were again Qiang and Xianbei rebellions, which would continue to plague Emperor An for the rest of his reign. The only border where there were Han accomplishments during Emperor An&#x27;s reign was on the northwestern front—the Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia)—where Ban Chao&#x27;s son Ban Yong () was able to reestablish Han dominance over a number of kingdoms.

In 124, Wang Sheng, Jiang Jing, and another eunuch Fan Feng () falsely accused Crown Prince Bao&#x27;s wet nurse Wang Nan () and chef Bing Ji (邴吉, not to be confused with Emperor Xuan&#x27;s prime minister of the same name), and Wang and Bing were executed. Crown Prince Bao was greatly saddened. Jiang and Fan, fearful of reprisals later, entered into a conspiracy with Empress Yan (who had always hated Crown Prince Bao as not born of herself) to falsely accuse Crown Prince Bao and his servants of crimes. Emperor An believed these charges, and demoted Crown Prince Bao to Prince of Jiyin.

In April 125, Emperor An was on a trip to Wancheng (宛城, in modern Nanyang, Henan) when he suddenly felt ill and decided to return to Luoyang. Before he could, however, he died. Empress Yan did not want to allow his son Prince Bao to be emperor. Instead, she made Liu Yi () emperor; Liu Yi had been the Marquess of Beixiang and was both a grandson of Emperor Zhang and Emperor An&#x27;s cousin. He is generally believed to have been far younger than Prince Bao, who was ten years old at the time, though his actual age is not recorded in history. On 11 June 125, Emperor An was buried and given the temple name &quot;Gongzong&quot;.

The young emperor, however, died later in December that year, and a number of eunuchs loyal to Prince Bao, led by Sun Cheng, carried out a coup d&#x27;état and made Prince Bao emperor (as Emperor Shun). The Yans were slaughtered, except for Empress Dowager Yan. Later, in 190, during the reign of Emperor Xian of Han, Emperor An&#x27;s temple name was revoked.

<doc id="343436" wikidata="Q7540785" url="?curid=343436" title="Slip-critical joint">
<text>Slip-critical joint, from structural engineering, is a type of bolted structural steel connection which relies on friction between the two connected elements rather than bolt shear or bolt bearing to join two structural elements.

Shear (and tension) loads can be transferred between two structural elements by either a bearing-type connection or a slip-critical connection.

In a slip-critical connection, loads are transferred from one element to another through friction forces developed between the faying surfaces of the connection. These friction forces are generated by the extreme tightness of the structural bolts holding the connection together. These bolts, usually tension control bolts or compressible washer tension indicating type bolts, are tensioned to a minimum required amount to generate large enough friction forces between the faying surfaces such that the shear (or tension) load is transferred by the structural members and not by the bolts (in shear) and the connection plates (in bearing). The &quot;turn of the nut&quot; method is also widely used to achieve that state of friction.

If slip-critical connections fail (by slipping), they revert to bearing-type connections, with structural forces now transferred through bolt shear and connection plate bearing. Thus a slippage failure of a slip-critical connection is not necessarily a catastrophic failure. However, slippage of a slip-critical connection in columns may lead to column instability. Slippage of a slip critical joint in a roof truss could result in unintended ponding effects.

The faying surfaces of slip-critical connections must be properly prepared in order to maximize friction forces between the surfaces joined. Usually, this requires cleaning, descaling, roughening, and/or blasting of the faying surfaces. Painting the faying surfaces with a class B primer also allows being in accordance with most of the design that asks for &quot;Slip-critical joint&quot;.</text><links>

<doc id="343442" wikidata="Q339889" url="?curid=343442" title="Ace (band)">
<text>Ace were a British rock band who enjoyed moderate success in the 1970s. Their membership included Paul Carrack, who later became famous as a vocalist for Mike + The Mechanics and as a solo artist. Ace were perhaps best known for their hit single &quot;How Long&quot;, which was a top 20 single in the United Kingdom in 1974, and reached no. 3 in the United States and Canada in 1975.

==Career==
The band formed in December 1972 in Sheffield as &quot;Ace Flash and the Dynamos&quot;, but soon shortened the name to &quot;Ace&quot;. The members were assembled from various professional bands. Carrack and Terry Comer had previously played with Warm Dust, and Alan &quot;Bam&quot; King with Mighty Baby and before that the 1960s band The Action. Fusing elements of pop and funk, Ace achieved popularity on the pub rock circuit. 

Before the recording of their debut album, &quot;Five-A-Side&quot;, the former drummer of Bees Make Honey, Fran Byrne, replaced Steve Witherington. The single &quot;How Long&quot; was taken from this record, and was a significant chart success, achieving a top 20 place in the UK Singles Chart, and reaching number three in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the spring of 1975. The &quot;Five-A-Side&quot; album did well on its own too, peaking at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Carrack, the band&#x27;s keyboardist and chief songwriter, sang lead on &quot;How Long&quot;, while follow-up singles were sung by other band members.

Ace eventually moved to the United States, replacing Phil Harris with Jon Woodhead in June 1976, and releasing their third and final album &quot;No Strings&quot; in January 1977. Unlike earlier Ace LPs, the latter featured Carrack&#x27;s vocals, with Carrack singing lead on the two singles issued from the album. The singles didn&#x27;t chart and Ace disbanded in July 1977, when Carrack, Comer and Byrne all joined Frankie Miller&#x27;s backing band.

In addition to his solo career, Carrack has since played with Eric Clapton, Nick Lowe, Roger Waters and his The Bleeding Heart Band, Roxy Music for the &quot;Manifesto&quot; album and tour, Squeeze in the early 1980s, and Mike + The Mechanics, for which he is best known. His solo re-recording of &quot;How Long&quot; became a UK top 40 hit again in 1996.

<doc id="343445" wikidata="Q333500" url="?curid=343445" title="Qian Xuesen">
<text>Qian Xuesen (; December 11, 1911October 31, 2009; also spelled as Tsien Hsue-shen) was a Chinese aerospace engineer and cyberneticist who made significant contributions to the field of aerodynamics and established engineering cybernetics. He achieved recognition as one of America&#x27;s leading experts in rockets and high-speed flight theory prior to his returning to China in 1955.

Qian received his undergraduate education in mechanical engineering at National Chiao Tung University in Shanghai in 1934. He traveled to the United States in 1935 and attained a master&#x27;s degree in aeronautical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1936. Afterward, he joined Theodore von Kármán&#x27;s group at the California Institute of Technology in 1936, received a doctorate in aeronautics and mathematics there in 1939, and became an associate professor at Caltech in 1943. While at Caltech, he co-founded NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He was recruited by the United States Department of Defense and the Department of War to serve in various positions, including as an expert consultant with a rank of colonel in 1945. At the same time, he became an associate professor at MIT in 1946, a full professor at MIT in 1947, and a full professor at Caltech in 1949.

During the Second Red Scare in the 1950s, the United States federal government accused him of communist sympathies. In 1950, despite protests by his colleagues and without any evidence of the allegations, he was stripped of his security clearance. He was given a deferred deportation order by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and for the following five years, he and his family were subjected to partial house arrest and government surveillance in an effort to gradually make his technical knowledge obsolete. After spending five years under house arrest, he was released in 1955 in exchange for the repatriation of American pilots who had been captured during the Korean War. He left the United States in September 1955 on the American President Lines passenger liner SS &quot;President Cleveland&quot;, arriving in mainland China via Hong Kong.

Upon his return, he helped lead development of the Dongfeng ballistic missile and the Chinese space program. He also played a significant part in the construction and development of China&#x27;s defense industry, higher education and research system, rocket force, and a key technology university. For his contributions, he became known as the &quot;Father of Chinese Rocketry&quot;, nicknamed the &quot;King of Rocketry&quot;. He is recognized as one of the founding fathers of Two Bombs, One Satellite.

In 1957, Qian was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He served as a Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference from 1987 to 1998.

He was the cousin of engineer Hsue-Chu Tsien, who was involved in the aerospace industries of both China and the United States. His nephew, Roger Y. Tsien, was the 2008 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

== Early life and education ==
Qian was born in the Shanghai International Settlement, with ancestral roots in Lin&#x27;an, Hangzhou, in 1911. His parents were Qian Junfu and Zhang Lanjuan. He graduated from the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, and attended Shanghai Jiaotong University. There, he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering with an emphasis on railroad administration in 1934. He interned at Nanchang Air Force Base.

After graduating from college, Qian was admitted to the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship program, enabling him to study in the United States. He left China in August 1935, and went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a master&#x27;s program in mechanical engineering. He received a Master of Science in aeronautical engineering from MIT on December 18, 1936.

While at MIT, Qian was influenced by the methods of American engineering education, especially its focus on experimentation. This was in contrast to the contemporary approach practiced by many Chinese scientists, which emphasized theoretical elements rather than direct experience. Qian&#x27;s experiments included plotting of pitot pressures using mercury-filled manometers.

Theodore von Kármán, Qian&#x27;s doctoral advisor, described their first meeting:
Kármán made his home a social scene for the aerodynamicists of Pasadena, and Qian was drawn in: &quot;Tsien enjoyed visiting my home, and my sister took to him because of his interesting ideas and straightforward manner.&quot;

Shortly after arriving at the California Institute of Technology in 1936, Qian became fascinated with the rocketry ideas of Frank Malina, other students of von Kármán, and their associates, including Jack Parsons. Along with his fellow students, he was involved in rocket-related experiments at the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech. Around the university, the dangerous and explosive nature of their work earned them the nickname &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;. Qian received a Doctor of Philosophy in aeronautics and mathematics from Caltech on June 9, 1939.

== Career in the United States ==
In 1943, Qian and two other members of their rocketry group drafted the first document to use the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In response to the German V-1 cruise missile and V-2 rocket, he and other important US scientists developed a variety of highly effective missiles that were vital in the closing stages of World War II.

In 1945, as an Army colonel with a security clearance, Qian was sent to Germany to investigate laboratories and question German scientists, including Wernher von Braun, and &quot;to recruit German scientists for the American missile program&quot;.

Von Kármán wrote of Qian, &quot;At the age of 36, he was an undisputed genius whose work was providing an enormous impetus to advances in high-speed aerodynamics and jet propulsion.&quot; During this time, he worked on designing an intercontinental space plane, which would later inspire the X-20 Dyna-Soar, a precursor to the American Space Shuttle.

Qian married Jiang Ying, a famed opera singer and the daughter of Jiang Baili and his wife, Japanese nurse Satô Yato. The elder Jiang was a military strategist and adviser to Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek. The Qians were married on September 14, 1947 in Shanghai, and had two children; their son Qian Yonggang (, also known as Yucon Qian) was born in Boston on October 13, 1948, while their daughter Qian Yongzhen () was born in early 1950 when the family was residing in Pasadena, California.

Shortly after his wedding, Qian returned to America to take up a teaching position at MIT. Jiang Ying would join him in December 1947. In 1949, with the recommendation of von Kármán, Qian became a Robert H. Goddard Professor of Jet Propulsion at Caltech. He was also appointed the first director of the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Jet Propulsion Center at Caltech.

In 1947, Qian was granted a permanent resident permit, and in 1949, he applied for naturalization, although he could not obtain citizenship. Years later, his wife Jiang Ying said in an interview with Phoenix Television that Qian did not apply for naturalization at all.

=== Detention ===
By the early 1940s, U.S. Army Intelligence was already aware of allegations that Qian was a communist, but his security clearance was not suspended until prior to the Korean War. On June 6, 1950, the Army abruptly revoked Qian&#x27;s security clearance, and he was questioned by the FBI. Despite support from his colleagues and no proof of the allegations, he received a deferred deportation order from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and for the following five years, he and his family were subjected to partial house arrest and government surveillance intended to undermine his technical expertise. Two weeks later, Qian announced that he would resign from Caltech.

While at Caltech, Qian had secretly attended meetings with J. Robert Oppenheimer&#x27;s brother Frank Oppenheimer, Jack Parsons, and Frank Malina that were organized by the Russian-born Jewish chemist Sidney Weinbaum and called Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Weinbaum&#x27;s trial commenced on August 30 and both Frank Oppenheimer and Parsons testified against him. Weinbaum was convicted of perjury and sentenced to four years. Qian was taken into custody on September 6, 1950, for questioning and for two weeks was detained at Terminal Island, a low-security United States federal prison near the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. According to Theodore von Kármán&#x27;s autobiography, when Qian refused to testify against his old friend Sidney Weinbaum, the FBI decided to launch an investigation on Qian.

In August, Qian spoke with Dan A. Kimball, the United States Under Secretary of the Navy at the time, whom he knew personally. During their conversation, Qian described the FBI visits and the indignity of losing his security clearance, even breaking down in tears. Kimball, determined to help, referred Qian to a lawyer in Washington, DC, to assist him in having his security clearance restored. Qian intended to return to China to resolve family issues and later come back to the United States, but Kimball preferred that Qian remain in the USA.

After the packing company moving Qian&#x27;s belongings to mainland China informed U.S. Customs that some of Qian&#x27;s documents were marked &quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;Confidential,&quot; U.S. officials raided the packing company&#x27;s warehouse in Pasadena, California. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a warrant for Qian&#x27;s arrest on August 25. Qian stated that all classified documents were locked in a cabinet in his office, and he gave the keys to a colleague, Clark Blanchard Millikan. In a press statement, Qian clarified, &quot;There are some drawings and logarithm tables, etc., which someone might have mistaken for codes. I wished to take my personal notes, many of which were merely lecture notes, and other material with me for study while I was gone. I most certainly was not attempting to take anything of a secret nature with me or trying to leave the country in any but the accepted manner.&quot; The material included &quot;newspaper, magazine, and scientific journal clippings on the U.S. atomic energy program&quot; and news clippings about the trials of those charged with atomic espionage, such as Klaus Fuchs. Subsequent examination of the documents showed they contained no classified material. Various agencies, such as The United States Atomic Energy Commission, noted that the information held by Qian was unclassified information and did not pose a threat to national security. They further explained that the technical papers in Qian&#x27;s collection were either outdated or authored by him, and that all the documents he had were characteristic of those held by top experts in the fields of aircraft and missile design.

On April 26, 1951, Qian was declared subject to deportation and forbidden from leaving Los Angeles County without permission, effectively placing him under house arrest.

During this time, Qian wrote &quot;Engineering Cybernetics&quot;, which was published by McGraw Hill in 1954. The book deals with the practice of stabilizing servomechanisms. In its 18 chapters, it considers non-interacting controls of many-variable systems, control design by perturbation theory, and John von Neumann&#x27;s theory of error control. Ezra Krendel reviewed the book, stating that it is &quot;difficult to overstate the value of Qian&#x27;s book to those interested in the overall theory of complex control systems&quot;. Evidently, Qian&#x27;s approach is primarily practical, as Krendel notes that for servomechanisms, the &quot;usual linear design criterion of stability is inadequate and other criteria arising from the physics of the problem must be used.&quot;

== Return to China ==

Qian became the subject of five years of secret diplomacy and negotiation between the U.S. and China. During this time, he lived under constant surveillance with the permission to teach without any classified research duties. Qian received support from his colleagues at Caltech during his incarceration, including president Lee DuBridge, who flew to Washington to argue Qian&#x27;s case. Caltech appointed attorney Grant Cooper to defend Qian.

The travel ban on Qian was lifted on August 4, 1955, and he resigned from Caltech shortly thereafter. With Dwight Eisenhower agreeing, Qian departed from Los Angeles for Hong Kong aboard the in September 1955 amidst rumors that his release was a swap for 11 U.S. airmen held captive by communist China since the end of the Korean War. Qian arrived at Hong Kong on October 8, 1955, and entered mainland China via the Kowloon–Canton Railway later that day.

Under Secretary Kimball, who had tried for several years to keep Qian in the U.S., commented on his treatment: &quot;It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a communist than I was, and we forced him to go.&quot;

Upon his return, Qian began a successful career in rocket science, boosted by the reputation he garnered for his past achievements as well as Chinese state support for his nuclear research. He led, and eventually became the father of, the Chinese missile program, which constructed the Silkworm missiles, the Dongfeng ballistic missiles and the Long March space rockets.

== Career in China ==
In October 1956, Qian became the director of the Fifth Academy of the Ministry of National Defense, tasked with ballistic missile and nuclear weapons development.

Qian&#x27;s reputation as a prominent scientist who was caught up in the Red Scare in the United States gave him considerable influence during the Mao era and afterward. Qian eventually rose through Party ranks to become a Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party member. He became associated with the &quot;China&#x27;s Space Program – From Conception to Manned Spaceflight&quot; initiative.

In 1955, Qian returned to China as part of an agreement for the release of American prisoners in China, and he was welcomed as a hero. He soon took charge of the country&#x27;s missile and satellite programs. Qian survived both the Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957 and the Cultural Revolution by adapting to the shifting political climate in China. For example, in 1958, Qian wrote an article with &quot;scientific&quot; support of the Great Leap Forward. In 1989, after the Tiananmen massacre, he denounced the demonstrators as &#x27;evil elements&#x27; and, in line with prevailing orthodoxy, branded the dissident astrophysicist Fang Lizhi &#x27;the scum of the nation&#x27;.

Qian was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1957, a lifelong honor granted to Chinese scientists who have made significant advancements in their field. He organized scientific seminars and dedicated some of his time to training successors for his positions.

He was heavily involved in the establishment of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 1958 and served as the Chairman of the Department of Modern Mechanics of the university for a number of years.

In 1969, Qian was one of a group of scientists who spoke with Australian journalist Francis James, describing China&#x27;s first seven nuclear tests and details of a gaseous diffusion plant near Lanzhou.

Outside of rocketry, Qian had a presence in numerous areas of study. He was among the creators of systematics, and made contributions to science and technology systems, somatic science, engineering science, military science, social science, the natural sciences, geography, philosophy, literature and art, and education. His advancements in the concepts, theories, and methods of the system science field include studying the open complex giant system. Additionally, he helped establish the Chinese school of complexity science.

From the 1980s onward, Qian had advocated the scientific investigation of traditional Chinese medicine, qigong, and the pseudoscientific concept of &quot;special human body functions&quot;. He particularly encouraged scientists to accumulate observational data on qigong so that &quot;future scientific theories could be established&quot;.

== Later life ==
Qian retired in 1991 and lived quietly in Beijing, refusing to speak to Westerners.

In 1979, Qian was awarded Caltech&#x27;s &quot;Distinguished Alumni Award&quot; for his achievements. Qian eventually received his award from Caltech, and with the help of his friend Frank Marble, brought it to his home in a widely covered ceremony. Furthermore, in the early 1990s, the filing cabinets containing Qian&#x27;s research work were offered to him by Caltech.

Qian was invited to visit the U.S. by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics after the normalization of relations between the two countries, but he refused the invitation, having wanted a formal apology for his detention. In a reminiscence published in 2002, Marble stated that he believed Qian had &quot;lost faith in the American government&quot; but that he had &quot;always had very warm feelings for the American people.&quot; Despite this, Xuesen approved the decision of both his children, US citizens by birth, to return to the US to study.

The Chinese government launched its manned space program in 1992, reportedly with some help from Russia due to their extended history in space. Qian&#x27;s research was used as the basis for the Long March rocket, which successfully launched the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. The elderly Qian was able to watch China&#x27;s first manned space mission on television from his hospital bed.

In 2008, he was named &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; Person of the Year. The recognition was not intended as an honor, but is given to the person judged to have the greatest impact on aviation in the past year. That year, China Central Television named Qian as one of the eleven most inspiring people in China.

On October 31, 2009, Qian died at the age of 97 in Beijing from lung illness.

A Chinese film production, &quot;Hsue-shen Tsien&quot;, directed by Zhang Jianya and starring Chen Kun as Qian, was simultaneously released in Asia and North America on December 11, 2011, and on March 2, 2012, it was released in China.

== Legacy in China ==

After his retirement in 1991, Qian received numerous honorary titles in China, was highly praised in press and by party officials, that was even called &quot;Qian Xuesen fever&quot;. Ning Wang describes it as Chinese propaganda campaign &quot;to commend and eulogize&quot; Qian&#x27;s life. In 1989, public movement &quot;learn from Qian Xuesen&quot; was officially launched by the Commission of Science for National Defence, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Chinese Association of Science and Technology. Qian received honorary titles &quot;State Scientist of Outstanding Contribution&quot;, got a &quot;Medal for the First Class Heroic Model&quot;, and was called by state leaders &quot;the People&#x27;s Scientist&quot;, &quot;National Hero&quot; and &quot;the Pillar of the State&quot;. For his 90th birthday in 2001, celebrations and praising were &quot;comparable with that for Deng Xiaoping during 1992–97&quot;.

Wang writes that heroization of Qian was made for several purposes: his &quot;deep engagement in China&#x27;s national defence programmes&quot;, &quot;allegiance to the Party and his well-articulated commitment to state ideology&quot;, &quot;rapid emergence of Chinese anti-Americanism&quot;, and to create a role model of a &quot;party scientist&quot;. Wang writes that in the 1990s, students &quot;claimed to appreciate Qian&#x27;s scientific accomplishments and the significance of science and technology, taking him as a model and swearing to study hard to be the &#x27;next Qian Xuesen&#x27;.&quot;

Qian himself tried to avoid publicity, and did not allow writing his biography until he got the title of &quot;State Scientist&quot;. During this heroization campaigns, multiple official and unofficial biographies were published. &#x27;Official&#x27; biographies were written by Qian&#x27;s secretaries by party requests. Wang Shouyun wrote &quot;A Biography of Qian Xuesen&quot; in 1991, Tu Yuanji published another book in 2002. Unofficial biographies are based on these two books, and were published by Wang Wenhua, Qi Shuying, and Hu Shihong, among others. All the biographies lack references to source material; Wang describes all the Chinese biographies of Qian as following:

From these multifarious biographies we learn that Qian was a prodigy, a scientific genius from the outset. He was gifted with a golden mind in mathematics and displayed multiple talents at young age – such as memorizing hundred of poems when he was three – and was good at music and painting when growing up. In MIT and Caltech, Qian was brighter than his classmates and surprised professors with the intelligence of Chinese youth. He was particularly good at playing darts in childhood, which presaged his talent in rocketry. ... These narratives create a near-miraculous Qian, with a strong impression that he was not only a missile expert, but an all-rounder; not only a scientific giant, but a built-in communist revolutionary.
Biopic &quot;Qian Xuesen&quot;, directed by Zhang Jianya with Chen Kun, Zhang Yuqi and Zhang Tielin in the main roles, was released in 2021.

<text>Attrition warfare is a military strategy consisting of belligerent attempts to win a war by wearing down the enemy to the point of collapse through continuous losses in personnel, materiel and morale. The word &quot;attrition&quot; comes from the Latin root , meaning &quot;to rub against&quot;, similar to the &quot;grinding down&quot; of the opponent&#x27;s forces in attrition warfare.

==Strategic considerations==
Attrition warfare represents an attempt to grind down an opponent&#x27;s ability to make war by destroying their military resources by any means including guerrilla warfare, people&#x27;s war, scorched earth and all types of battles apart from a decisive battle. Attrition warfare does not include Blitzkrieg or using concentration of force and a decisive battle to win. The side that reinforces their army at a higher speed will normally win the war. Clausewitz called it the exhaustion of the adversary.

A side that perceives itself to be at a marked disadvantage may deliberately seek out attrition warfare to neutralize its opponent&#x27;s advantages over time. Sun Tzu has stated that there is no country that has benefitted from prolonged warfare, but Russia in 1812 won the war with attrition warfare against Napoleon. When attritional methods have worn down the enemy sufficiently to make other methods feasible, attritional methods are often complemented or even abandoned by other strategies. World War I military commanders on both sides ineffectively relied on attrition warfare, which resulted in casualties without a strategic result.

The difference between war of attrition and other forms of war is somewhat artificial since even a single battle normally contains an element of attrition. A strategy of attrition is an attempt to cause the enemy great losses in a single stroke (such as by encirclement and capture). Attrition warfare also tries to increase the friction in a war for the opponent.

While attrition warfare might appear to be a strategic option for combatants possessing greater resources or asymmetric advantages over their adversaries, it also carries considerable drawbacks. Perhaps the most common reason for failure of attrition warfare is related to the time required to fulfill one&#x27;s war goals. The geopolitical and strategic situation may shift dramatically over long periods of time, potentially giving the opponent an edge if victory is not achieved soon enough. Additionally, the attrition strategies gives opponents time to adjust tactics and strategy. Although the strategy is typically victorious for the more well-resourced nation, it may eventually fail due to operational and geopolitical mishaps, such as Athens during the Peloponnesian War, or due to strategic miscalculations, such as Germany during the Battle of Britain.

==Examples in history==
===Most typical===

The French invasion of Russia is a textbook example of attrition warfare, where Russia interfered with Napoleon&#x27;s military logistics and won the war without a decisive battle. One of the best visual representations of the Russian attrition warfare strategies was created by Charles Joseph Minard. It shows the steady decrease of the number of soldiers of the French Grande Armée during the course of the war.
===Best known===

One commonly known example of attrition warfare might be on the Western Front during World War I. Both military forces found themselves in static defensive positions in trenches running from Switzerland to the English Channel. For years, without any opportunity for maneuvers, the only way the commanders thought that they could defeat the enemy was to repeatedly attack head on and grind the other down.

One of the most enduring examples of attrition warfare on the Western Front is the Battle of Verdun, which took place throughout most of 1916. Erich von Falkenhayn later claimed that his tactics at Verdun were designed not to take the city but rather to destroy the French Army in its defense. Falkenhayn is described as wanting to &quot;bleed France white&quot; and thus the attrition tactics were employed in the battle.

Soldiers on the Italian Front fought a series of battles of attrition along the Isonzo River between June 1915 and November 1917.

Attritional warfare in World War I has been shown by historians such as Hew Strachan to have been used as a &quot;post hoc ergo propter hoc&quot; excuse for failed offensives. Contemporary sources disagree with Strachan&#x27;s view on this. While the Christmas Memorandum is a post-war invention, the strategy of attritional warfare was the original strategy for the battle.

<text>Tisdale is the business centre for the rich agricultural boreal forest area in central Saskatchewan, Canada. This town is in the Rural Municipality of Tisdale No. 427.

Located at the junction of Highway 35 and Highway 3, and serviced by both the Canadian National Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway, Tisdale is the grain handling centre of the region with five inland grain terminals, and is the centre of regional industry.

The intersection of Highways 3 and 35 has traffic volumes of 11,200 vehicles per day and is the location of the largest 7-Eleven in Canada (by floor space) and the long roadside statue of &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Honey Bee&quot; (the Giant Bee in Falher, is actually bigger at ).

This town is the administrative office of the Kinistin Saulteaux Nation band government.

==History==
English explorer Henry Kelsey passed through this area in 1690 during his exploration of the Carrot River.

The post office of Tisdale, provisional District of Saskatchewan, North-West Territories was created on 1 February 1904. The community was originally known as &quot;Doghide&quot; after the Doghide River that flows through the town, but with the arrival of the railway the community was renamed &quot;Tisdale&quot; in honour of F.W. Tisdale, an employee of the Canadian Northern Railway.

Western Canada&#x27;s biggest gun shoot out took place just east of Tisdale in 1920. The historic gunfight involved a squad of Saskatchewan Provincial Police and four outlaws.

In 2005, Tisdale celebrated its 100th birthday with a homecoming celebration in conjunction with Saskatchewan&#x27;s centennial. The town also underwent beautification projects, including the construction of a new town square.

In 2016, Tisdale changed its town motto from &quot;The land of rape and honey&quot; to &quot;Opportunity grows here&quot;.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Tisdale had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Economy==
For 60 years, until October 2015, Tisdale was known as the &quot;Land of Rape and Honey&quot; due to its significance in both rapeseed and honey production. Tisdale is also known as the Honey Capital of Saskatchewan. One third of the farmland in the Northeast region is cropped into canola and 10% of the honey produced in Canada comes from this area. Traditionally the area produces about ($7.2 million) in honey. Due to the sexual alternate meaning, industrial metal band Ministry named their 1988 album &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; after seeing the motto on a Tisdale souvenir mug. The town adopted the new motto &quot;Opportunity Grows Here&quot; on 22 August 2016.

==Attractions==

<doc id="343457" wikidata="Q3720208" url="?curid=343457" title="Maternal effect">
<text>A maternal effect is a situation where the phenotype of an organism is determined not only by the environment it experiences and its genotype, but also by the environment and genotype of its mother. In genetics, maternal effects occur when an organism shows the phenotype expected from the genotype of the mother, irrespective of its own genotype, often due to the mother supplying messenger RNA or proteins to the egg. Maternal effects can also be caused by the maternal environment independent of genotype, sometimes controlling the size, sex, or behaviour of the offspring. These adaptive maternal effects lead to phenotypes of offspring that increase their fitness. Further, it introduces the concept of phenotypic plasticity, an important evolutionary concept. It has been proposed that maternal effects are important for the evolution of adaptive responses to environmental heterogeneity.

==In genetics==

In genetics, a maternal effect occurs when the phenotype of an organism is determined by the genotype of its mother. For example, if a mutation is maternal effect recessive, then a female homozygous for the mutation may appear phenotypically normal, however her offspring will show the mutant phenotype, even if they are heterozygous for the mutation.

Maternal effects often occur because the mother supplies a particular mRNA or protein to the oocyte, hence the maternal genome determines whether the molecule is functional. Maternal supply of mRNAs to the early embryo is important, as in many organisms the embryo is initially transcriptionally inactive. Because of the inheritance pattern of maternal effect mutations, special genetic screens are required to identify them. These typically involve examining the phenotype of the organisms one generation later than in a conventional (zygotic) screen, as their mothers will be potentially homozygous for maternal effect mutations that arise.

===In &quot;Drosophila&quot; early embryogenesis===

A &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; oocyte develops in an egg chamber in close association with a set of cells called nurse cells. Both the oocyte and the nurse cells are descended from a single germline stem cell, however cytokinesis is incomplete in these cell divisions, and the cytoplasm of the nurse cells and the oocyte is connected by structures known as ring canals. Only the oocyte undergoes meiosis and contributes DNA to the next generation.

Many maternal effect &quot;Drosophila&quot; mutants have been found that affect the early steps in embryogenesis such as axis determination, including &quot;bicoid, dorsal, gurken&quot; and &quot;oskar&quot;. For example, embryos from homozygous &quot;bicoid&quot; mothers fail to produce head and thorax structures.

Once the gene that is disrupted in the &quot;bicoid&quot; mutant was identified, it was shown that &quot;bicoid&quot; mRNA is transcribed in the nurse cells and then relocalized to the oocyte. Other maternal effect mutants either affect products that are similarly produced in the nurse cells and act in the oocyte, or parts of the transportation machinery that are required for this relocalization. Since these genes are expressed in the (maternal) nurse cells and not in the oocyte or fertilised embryo, the maternal genotype determines whether they can function.

Maternal effect genes are expressed during oogenesis by the mother (expressed prior to fertilization) and develop the anterior-posterior and dorsal ventral polarity of the egg. The anterior end of the egg becomes the head; posterior end becomes the tail. the dorsal side is on the top; the ventral side is in underneath. The products of maternal effect genes called maternal mRNAs are produced by nurse cell and follicle cells and deposited in the egg cells (oocytes). At the start of development process, mRNA gradients are formed in oocytes along anterior-posterior and dorsal ventral axes.

About thirty maternal genes are involved in pattern formation have been identified. In particular, products of four maternal effect genes are critical to the formation of anterior-posterior axis. The product of two maternal effect gene, bicoid and hunchback, regulates formation of anterior structure while another pair nanos and caudal, specifies protein that regulates formation of posterior part of embryo.

The transcript of all four genes-bicoid, hunchback, caudal, nanos are synthesized by nurse and follicle cells and transported into the oocytes.

===In birds===
In birds, mothers may pass down hormones in their eggs that affect an offspring&#x27;s growth and behavior. Experiments in domestic canaries have shown that eggs that contain more yolk androgens develop into chicks that display more social dominance. Similar variation in yolk androgen levels has been seen in bird species like the American coot, though the mechanism of effect has yet to be established.

=== In humans ===
In 2015, obesity theorist Edward Archer published &quot;The Childhood Obesity Epidemic as a Result of Nongenetic Evolution: The Maternal Resources Hypothesis&quot; and a series of works on maternal effects in human obesity and health. In this body of work, Archer argued that accumulative maternal effects via the non-genetic evolution of matrilineal nutrient metabolism is responsible for the increased global prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2. Archer posited that decrements in maternal metabolic control altered fetal pancreatic beta cell, adipocyte (fat cell) and myocyte (muscle cell) development thereby inducing an enduring competitive advantage of adipocytes in the acquisition and sequestering on nutrient energy.

===In plants===
The environmental cues such as light, temperature, soil moisture and nutrients that the mother plant encounters can cause variations in seed quality, even within the same genotype. Thus, the mother plant greatly influences seed traits such as seed size, germination rate, and viability.

==Environmental maternal effects==
The environment or condition of the mother can also in some situations influence the phenotype of her offspring, independent of the offspring&#x27;s genotype.

== Paternal effect genes ==

In contrast, a paternal effect is when a phenotype results from the genotype of the father, rather than the genotype of the individual. The genes responsible for these effects are components of sperm that are involved in fertilization and early development. An example of a paternal-effect gene is the ms(3)sneaky in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Males with a mutant allele of this gene produce sperm that are able to fertilize an egg, but the sneaky-inseminated eggs do not develop normally. However, females with this mutation produce eggs that undergo normal development when fertilized.

==Adaptive maternal effects==

Adaptive maternal effects induce phenotypic changes in offspring that result in an increase in fitness. These changes arise from mothers sensing environmental cues that work to reduce offspring fitness, and then responding to them in a way that then “prepares” offspring for their future environments. A key characteristic of “adaptive maternal effects” phenotypes is their plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity gives organisms the ability to respond to different environments by altering their phenotype. With these “altered” phenotypes increasing fitness it becomes important to look at the likelihood that adaptive maternal effects will evolve and become a significant phenotypic adaptation to an environment.

===Defining adaptive maternal effects===

When traits are influenced by either the maternal environment or the maternal phenotype, it is said to be influenced by maternal effects. Maternal effects work to alter the phenotypes of the offspring through pathways other than DNA. &quot;Adaptive&quot; maternal effects are when these maternal influences lead to a phenotypic change that increases the fitness of the offspring. In general, adaptive maternal effects are a mechanism to cope with factors that work to reduce offspring fitness; they are also environment specific.

It can sometimes be difficult to differentiate between maternal and adaptive maternal effects. Consider the following: Gypsy moths reared on foliage of black oak, rather than chestnut oak, had offspring that developed faster. This is a maternal, &quot;not&quot; an adaptive maternal effect. In order to be an adaptive maternal effect, the mother&#x27;s environment would have to have led to a change in the eating habits or behavior of the offspring. The key difference between the two therefore, is that adaptive maternal effects are environment specific. The phenotypes that arise are in response to the mother sensing an environment that would reduce the fitness of her offspring. By accounting for this environment she is then able to alter the phenotypes to actually increase the offspring&#x27;s fitness. &quot;Maternal&quot; effects are not in response to an environmental cue, and further they have the potential to increase offspring fitness, but they may not.

When looking at the likelihood of these “altered” phenotypes evolving there are many factors and cues involved. Adaptive maternal effects evolve only when offspring can face many potential environments; when a mother can “predict” the environment into which her offspring will be born; and when a mother can influence her offspring&#x27;s phenotype, thereby increasing their fitness. The summation of all of these factors can then lead to these “altered” traits becoming favorable for evolution.

The phenotypic changes that arise from adaptive maternal effects are a result of the mother sensing that a certain aspect of the environment may decrease the survival of her offspring. When sensing a cue the mother “relays” information to the developing offspring and therefore induces adaptive maternal effects. This tends to then cause the offspring to have a higher fitness because they are “prepared” for the environment they are likely to experience. These cues can include responses to predators, habitat, high population density, and food availability
The increase in size of Northern American red squirrels is a great example of an adaptive maternal effect producing a phenotype that resulted in an increased fitness. The adaptive maternal effect was induced by the mothers sensing the high population density and correlating it to low food availability per individual. Her offspring were on average larger than other squirrels of the same species; they also grew faster. Ultimately, the squirrels born during this period of high population density showed an increased survival rate (and therefore fitness) during their first winter.

===Phenotypic plasticity===

When analyzing the types of changes that can occur to a phenotype, we can see changes that are behavioral, morphological, or physiological. A characteristic of the phenotype that arises through adaptive maternal effects, is the plasticity of this phenotype. Phenotypic plasticity allows organisms to adjust their phenotype to various environments, thereby enhancing their fitness to changing environmental conditions. Ultimately it is a key attribute to an organism&#x27;s, and a population&#x27;s, ability to adapt to short term environmental change.

Phenotypic plasticity can be seen in many organisms, one species that exemplifies this concept is the seed beetle &quot;Stator limbatus&quot;. This seed beetle reproduces on different host plants, two of the more common ones being &quot;Cercidium floridum&quot; and &quot;Acacia greggii&quot;. When &quot;C. floridum&quot; is the host plant, there is selection for a large egg size; when &quot;A. greggii&quot; is the host plant, there is a selection for a smaller egg size. In an experiment it was seen that when a beetle who usually laid eggs on &quot;A. greggii&quot; was put onto &quot;C. floridum&quot;, the survivorship of the laid eggs was lower compared to those eggs produced by a beetle that was conditioned and remained on the &quot;C. florium&quot; host plant. Ultimately these experiments showed the plasticity of egg size production in the beetle, as well as the influence of the maternal environment on the survivorship of the offspring.

===Further examples of adaptive maternal effects===

In many insects:
* Cues such as rapidly cooling temperatures or decreasing daylight can result in offspring that enter into a dormant state. They therefore will better survive the cooling temperatures and preserve energy.
* When parents are forced to lay eggs on environments with low nutrients, offspring will be provided with more resources, such as higher nutrients, through an increased egg size.
* Cues such as poor habitat or crowding can lead to offspring with wings. The wings allow the offspring to move away from poor environments to ones that will provide better resources.

==Maternal diet and environment influence epigenetic effects==
Related to adaptive maternal effects are epigenetic effects. Epigenetics is the study of long lasting changes in gene expression that are produced by modifications to chromatin instead of changes in DNA sequence, as is seen in DNA mutation. This &quot;change&quot; refers to DNA methylation, histone acetylation, or the interaction of non-coding RNAs with DNA. DNA methylation is the addition of methyl groups to the DNA. When DNA is methylated in mammals, the transcription of the gene at that location is turned down or turned off entirely. The induction of DNA methylation is highly influenced by the maternal environment. Some maternal environments can lead to a higher methylation of an offspring&#x27;s DNA, while others lower methylation.[22] The fact that methylation can be influenced by the maternal environment, makes it similar to adaptive maternal effects. Further similarities are seen by the fact that methylation can often increase the fitness of the offspring. Additionally, epigenetics can refer to histone modifications or non-coding RNAs that create a sort of cellular memory. Cellular memory refers to a cell&#x27;s ability to pass nongenetic information to its daughter cell during replication. For example, after differentiation, a liver cell performs different functions than a brain cell; cellular memory allows these cells to &quot;remember&quot; what functions they are supposed to perform after replication. Some of these epigenetic changes can be passed down to future generations, while others are reversible within a particular individual&#x27;s lifetime. This can explain why individuals with identical DNA can differ in their susceptibility to certain chronic diseases.

Currently, researchers are examining the correlations between maternal diet during pregnancy and its effect on the offspring&#x27;s susceptibility for chronic diseases later in life. The fetal programming hypothesis highlights the idea that environmental stimuli during critical periods of fetal development can have lifelong effects on body structure and health and in a sense they prepare offspring for the environment they will be born into. Many of these variations are thought to be due to epigenetic mechanisms brought on by maternal environment such as stress, diet, gestational diabetes, and exposure to tobacco and alcohol. These factors are thought to be contributing factors to obesity and cardiovascular disease, neural tube defects, cancer, diabetes, etc. Studies to determine these epigenetic mechanisms are usually performed through laboratory studies of rodents and epidemiological studies of humans.

==Importance for the general population==
Knowledge of maternal diet induced epigenetic changes is important not only for scientists, but for the general public. Perhaps the most obvious place of importance for maternal dietary effects is within the medical field. In the United States and worldwide, many non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, obesity, and heart disease, have reached epidemic proportions. The medical field is working on methods to detect these diseases, some of which have been discovered to be heavily driven by epigenetic alterations due to maternal dietary effects. Once the genomic markers for these diseases are identified, research can begin to be implemented to identify the early onset of these diseases and possibly reverse the epigenetic effects of maternal diet in later life stages. The reversal of epigenetic effects will utilize the pharmaceutical field in an attempt to create drugs which target the specific genes and genomic alterations. The creation of drugs to cure these non-communicable diseases could be used to treat individuals who already have these illnesses. General knowledge of the mechanisms behind maternal dietary epigenetic effects is also beneficial in terms of awareness. The general public can be aware of the risks of certain dietary behaviors during pregnancy in an attempt to curb the negative consequences which may arise in offspring later in their lives. Epigenetic knowledge can lead to an overall healthier lifestyle for the billions of people worldwide.

The effect of maternal diet in species other than humans is also relevant. Many of the long term effects of global climate change are unknown. Knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms can help scientists better predict the impacts of changing community structures on species which are ecologically, economically, and/or culturally important around the world. Since many ecosystems will see changes in species structures, the nutrient availability will also be altered, ultimately affecting the available food choices for reproducing females. Maternal dietary effects may also be used to improve agricultural and aquaculture practices. Breeders may be able to utilize scientific data to create more sustainable practices, saving money for themselves, as well as the consumers.

==Maternal diet and environment epigenetically influences susceptibility for adult diseases==

===Hyperglycemia during gestation correlated with obesity and heart disease in adulthood===

Hyperglycemia during pregnancy is thought to cause epigenetic changes in the leptin gene of newborns leading to a potential increased risk for obesity and heart disease. Leptin is sometimes known as the “satiety hormone” because it is released by fat cells to inhibit hunger. By studying both animal models and human observational studies, it has been suggested that a leptin surge in the perinatal period plays a critical role in contributing to long-term risk of obesity. The perinatal period begins at 22 weeks gestation and ends a week after birth.[34] DNA methylation near the leptin locus has been examined to determine if there was a correlation between maternal glycemia and neonatal leptin levels. Results showed that glycemia was inversely associated with the methylation states of LEP gene, which controls the production of the leptin hormone. Therefore, higher glycemic levels in mothers corresponded to lower methylation states in LEP gene in their children. With this lower methylation state, the LEP gene is transcribed more often, thereby inducing higher blood leptin levels. These higher blood leptin levels during the perinatal period were linked to obesity in adulthood, perhaps due to the fact that a higher “normal” level of leptin was set during gestation. Because obesity is a large contributor to heart disease, this leptin surge is not only correlated with obesity but also heart disease.

===High fat diets during gestation correlated with metabolic syndrome===
High fat diets in utero are believed to cause metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a set of symptoms including obesity and insulin resistance that appear to be related. This syndrome is often associated with type II diabetes as well as hypertension and atherosclerosis. Using mice models, researchers have shown that high fat diets in utero cause modifications to the adiponectin and leptin genes that alter gene expression; these changes contribute to metabolic syndrome. The adiponectin genes regulate glucose metabolism as well as fatty acid breakdown; however, the exact mechanisms are not entirely understood. In both human and mice models, adiponectin has been shown to add insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties to different types of tissue, specifically muscle and liver tissue. Adiponectin has also been shown to increase the rate of fatty acid transport and oxidation in mice, which causes an increase in fatty acid metabolism. With a high fat diet during gestation, there was an increase in methylation in the promoter of the adiponectin gene accompanied by a decrease in acetylation. These changes likely inhibit the transcription of the adiponectin genes because increases in methylation and decreases in acetylation usually repress transcription. Additionally, there was an increase in methylation of the leptin promoter, which turns down the production of the leptin gene. Therefore, there was less adiponectin to help cells take up glucose and break down fat, as well as less leptin to cause a feeling of satiety. The decrease in these hormones caused fat mass gain, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, abnormal adiponectin and leptin levels, and hypertension throughout the animal&#x27;s lifetime. However, the effect was abolished after three subsequent generations with normal diets. This study highlights the fact that these epigenetic marks can be altered in as many as one generation and can even be completely eliminated over time. This study highlighted the connection between high fat diets to the adiponectin and leptin in mice. In contrast, few studies have been done in humans to show the specific effects of high fat diets in utero on humans. However, it has been shown that decreased adiponectin levels are associated with obesity, insulin resistance, type II diabetes, and coronary artery disease in humans. It is postulated that a similar mechanism as the one described in mice may also contribute to metabolic syndrome in humans.

===High fat diets during gestation correlated with chronic inflammation===

In addition, high fat diets cause chronic low-grade inflammation in the placenta, adipose, liver, brain, and vascular system. Inflammation is an important aspect of the bodies’ natural defense system after injury, trauma, or disease. During an inflammatory response, a series of physiological reactions, such as increased blood flow, increased cellular metabolism, and vasodilation, occur in order to help treat the wounded or infected area. However, chronic low-grade inflammation has been linked to long-term consequences such as cardiovascular disease, renal failure, aging, diabetes, etc. This chronic low-grade inflammation is commonly seen in obese individuals on high fat diets. In a mice model, excessive cytokines were detected in mice fed on a high fat diet. Cytokines aid in cell signaling during immune responses, specifically sending cells towards sites of inflammation, infection, or trauma. The mRNA of proinflammatory cytokines was induced in the placenta of mothers on high fat diets. The high fat diets also caused changes in microbiotic composition, which led to hyperinflammatory colonic responses in offspring. This hyperinflammatory response can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn&#x27;s disease or ulcerative colitis.[35] As previously mentioned, high fat diets in utero contribute to obesity; however, some proinflammatory factors, like IL-6 and MCP-1, are also linked to body fat deposition. It has been suggested that histone acetylation is closely associated with inflammation because the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors has been shown to reduce the expression of proinflammatory mediators in glial cells. This reduction in inflammation resulted in improved neural cell function and survival. This inflammation is also often associated with obesity, cardiovascular disease, fatty liver, brain damage, as well as preeclampsia and preterm birth. Although it has been shown that high fat diets induce inflammation, which contribute to all these chronic diseases; it is unclear as to how this inflammation acts as a mediator between diet and chronic disease.

===Undernutrition during gestation correlated with cardiovascular disease===

A study done after the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-1945 showed that undernutrition during the early stages of pregnancy are associated with hypomethylation of the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) gene even after six decades. These individuals had significantly lower methylation rates as compared to their same sex sibling who had not been conceived during the famine. A comparison was done with children conceived prior to the famine so that their mothers were nutrient deprived during the later stages of gestation; these children had normal methylation patterns. The IGF2 stands for insulin-like growth factor II; this gene is a key contributor in human growth and development. IGF2 gene is also maternally imprinted meaning that the mother&#x27;s gene is silenced. The mother&#x27;s gene is typically methylated at the differentially methylated region (DMR); however, when hypomethylated, the gene is bi-allelically expressed. Thus, individuals with lower methylation states likely lost some of the imprinting effect. Similar results have been demonstrated in the Nr3c1 and Ppara genes of the offspring of rats fed on an isocaloric protein-deficient diet before starting pregnancy. This further implies that the undernutrition was the cause of the epigenetic changes. Surprisingly, there was not a correlation between methylation states and birth weight. This displayed that birth weight may not be an adequate way to determine nutritional status during gestation. This study stressed that epigenetic effects vary depending on the timing of exposure and that early stages of mammalian development are crucial periods for establishing epigenetic marks. Those exposed earlier in gestation had decreased methylation while those who were exposed at the end of gestation had relatively normal methylation levels. The offspring and descendants of mothers with hypomethylation were more likely to develop cardiovascular disease. Epigenetic alterations that occur during embryogenesis and early fetal development have greater physiologic and metabolic effects because they are transmitted over more mitotic divisions. In other words, the epigenetic changes that occur earlier are more likely to persist in more cells.

===Nutrient restriction during gestation correlated with diabetes mellitus type 2===

In another study, researchers discovered that perinatal nutrient restriction resulting in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) contributes to diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). IUGR refers to the poor growth of the baby in utero. In the pancreas, IUGR caused a reduction in the expression of the promoter of the gene encoding a critical transcription factor for beta cell function and development. Pancreatic beta cells are responsible for making insulin; decreased beta cell activity is associated with DM2 in adulthood. In skeletal muscle, IUGR caused a decrease in expression of the Glut-4 gene. The Glut-4 gene controls the production of the Glut-4 transporter; this transporter is specifically sensitive to insulin. Thus, when insulin levels rise, more glut-4 transporters are brought to the cell membrane to increase the uptake of glucose into the cell. This change is caused by histone modifications in the cells of skeletal muscle that decrease the effectiveness of the glucose transport system into the muscle. Because the main glucose transporters are not operating at optimal capacity, these individuals are more likely to develop insulin resistance with energy rich diets later in life, contributing to DM2.

===High protein diet during gestation correlated with higher blood pressure and adiposity===
Further studies have examined the epigenetic changes resulting from a high protein/low carbohydrate diet during pregnancy. This diet caused epigenetic changes that were associated with higher blood pressure, higher cortisol levels, and a heightened Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress. Increased methylation in the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and H19 ICR were positively correlated with adiposity and blood pressure in adulthood. Glucocorticoids play a vital role in tissue development and maturation as well as having effects on metabolism. Glucocorticoids’ access to GR is regulated by HSD1 and HSD2. H19 is an imprinted gene for a long coding RNA (lncRNA), which has limiting effects on body weight and cell proliferation. Therefore, higher methylation rates in H19 ICR repress transcription and prevent the lncRNA from regulating body weight. Mothers who reported higher meat/fish and vegetable intake and lower bread/potato intake in late pregnancy had a higher average methylation in GR and HSD2. However, one common challenge of these types of studies is that many epigenetic modifications have tissue and cell-type specificity DNA methylation patterns. Thus, epigenetic modification patterns of accessible tissues, like peripheral blood, may not represent the epigenetic patterns of the tissue involved in a particular disease.

===Neonatal estrogen exposure correlated with prostate cancer===

Strong evidence in rats supports the conclusion that neonatal estrogen exposure plays a role in the development of prostate cancer. Using a human fetal prostate xenograft model, researchers studied the effects of early exposure to estrogen with and without secondary estrogen and testosterone treatment. A xenograft model is a graft of tissue transplanted between organisms of different species. In this case, human tissue was transplanted into rats; therefore, there was no need to extrapolate from rodents to humans. Histopathological lesions, proliferation, and serum hormone levels were measured at various time-points after xenografting. At day 200, the xenograft that had been exposed to two treatments of estrogen showed the most severe changes. Additionally, researchers looked at key genes involved in prostatic glandular and stromal growth, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, hormone receptors, and tumor suppressors using a custom PCR array. Analysis of DNA methylation showed methylation differences in CpG sites of the stromal compartment after estrogen treatment. These variations in methylation are likely a contributing cause to the changes in the cellular events in the KEGG prostate cancer pathway that inhibit apoptosis and increase cell cycle progression that contribute to the development of cancer.

=== Supplementation may reverse epigenetic changes ===

In utero or neonatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical used in manufacturing polycarbonate plastic, is correlated with higher body weight, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and an altered reproductive function. In a mice model, the mice fed on a BPA diet were more likely to have a yellow coat corresponding to their lower methylation state in the promoter regions of the retrotransposon upstream of the Agouti gene. The Agouti gene is responsible for determining whether an animal&#x27;s coat will be banded (agouti) or solid (non-agouti). However, supplementation with methyl donors like folic acid or phytoestrogen abolished the hypomethylating effect. This demonstrates that the epigenetic changes can be reversed through diet and supplementation.

==Maternal diet effects and ecology==
Maternal dietary effects are not just seen in humans, but throughout many taxa in the animal kingdom. These maternal dietary effects can result in ecological changes on a larger scale throughout populations and from generation to generation. The plasticity involved in these epigenetic changes due to maternal diet represents the environment into which the offspring will be born. Many times, epigenetic effects on offspring from the maternal diet during development will genetically prepare the offspring to be better adapted for the environment in which they will first encounter. The epigenetic effects of maternal diet can be seen in many species, utilizing different ecological cues and epigenetic mechanisms to provide an adaptive advantage to future generations.

Within the field of ecology, there are many examples of maternal dietary effects. Unfortunately, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying these phenotypic changes are rarely investigated. In the future, it would be beneficial for ecological scientists as well as epigenetic and genomic scientists to work together to fill the holes within the ecology field to produce a complete picture of environmental cues and epigenetic alterations producing phenotypic diversity.

===Parental diet affects offspring immunity===
A pyralid moth species, &quot;Plodia interpunctella&quot;, commonly found in food storage areas, exhibits maternal dietary effects, as well as paternal dietary effects, on its offspring. Epigenetic changes in moth offspring affect the production of phenoloxidase, an enzyme involved with melanization and correlated with resistance of certain pathogens in many invertebrate species. In this study, parent moths were housed in food rich or food poor environments during their reproductive period. Moths who were housed in food poor environments produced offspring with less phenoloxidase, and thus had a weaker immune system, than moths who reproduced in food rich environments. This is believed to be adaptive because the offspring develop while receiving cues of scarce nutritional opportunities. These cues allow the moth to allocate energy differentially, decreasing energy allocated for the immune system and devoting more energy towards growth and reproduction to increase fitness and insure future generations. One explanation for this effect may be imprinting, the expression of only one parental gene over the other, but further research has yet to be done.

Parental-mediated dietary epigenetic effects on immunity has a broader significance on wild organisms. Changes in immunity throughout an entire population may make the population more susceptible to an environmental disturbance, such as the introduction of a pathogen. Therefore, these transgenerational epigenetic effects can influence the population dynamics by decreasing the stability of populations who inhabit environments different from the parental environment that offspring are epigenetically modified for.

===Maternal diet affects offspring growth rate===

Food availability also influences the epigenetic mechanisms driving growth rate in the mouthbrooding cichlid, &quot;Simochromis pleurospilus&quot;. When nutrient availability is high, reproducing females will produce many small eggs, versus fewer, larger eggs in nutrient poor environments. Egg size often correlates with fish larvae body size at hatching: smaller larvae hatch from smaller eggs. In the case of the cichlid, small larvae grow at a faster rate than their larger egg counterparts. This is due to the increased expression of GHR, the growth hormone receptor. Increased transcription levels of GHR genes increase the receptors available to bind with growth hormone, GH, leading to an increased growth rate in smaller fish. Fish of larger size are less likely to be eaten by predators, therefore it is advantageous to grow quickly in early life stages to insure survival. The mechanism by which GHR transcription is regulated is unknown, but it may be due to hormones within the yolk produced by the mother, or just by the yolk quantity itself. This may lead to DNA methylation or histone modifications which control genic transcription levels.

Ecologically, this is an example of the mother utilizing her environment and determining the best method to maximize offspring survival, without actually making a conscious effort to do so. Ecology is generally driven by the ability of an organism to compete to obtain nutrients and successfully reproduce. If a mother is able to gather a plentiful amount of resources, she will have a higher fecundity and produce offspring who are able to grow quickly to avoid predation. Mothers who are unable to obtain as many nutrients will produce fewer offspring, but the offspring will be larger in hopes that their large size will help insure survival into sexual maturation. Unlike the moth example, the maternal effects provided to the cichlid offspring do not prepare the cichlids for the environment that they will be born into; this is because mouth brooding cichlids provide parental care to their offspring, providing a stable environment for the offspring to develop. Offspring who have a greater growth rate can become independent more quickly than slow growing counterparts, therefore decreasing the amount of energy spent by the parents during the parental care period.

A similar phenomenon occurs in the sea urchin, &quot;Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis&quot;. Urchin mothers in nutrient rich environments produce a large number of small eggs. Offspring from these small eggs grow at a faster rate than their large egg counterparts from nutrient poor mothers. Again, it is beneficial for sea urchin larvae, known as planula, to grow quickly to decrease the duration of their larval phase and metamorphose into a juvenile to decrease predation risks. Sea urchin larvae have the ability to develop into one of two phenotypes, based on their maternal and larval nutrition. Larvae who grow at a fast rate from high nutrition, are able to devote more of their energy towards development into the juvenile phenotype. Larvae who grow at a slower rate with low nutrition, devote more energy towards growing spine-like appendages to protect themselves from predators in an attempt to increase survival into the juvenile phase. The determination of these phenotypes is based on both the maternal and the juvenile nutrition. The epigenetic mechanisms behind these phenotypic changes is unknown, but it is believed that there may be a nutritional threshold that triggers epigenetic changes affecting development and, ultimately, the larval phenotype.

<text>The Marquess of Beixiang (; died 10 December 125), personal name Liu Yi, also referred to as Emperor Shao (少帝, literally &quot;young emperor&quot;), was an emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty. He was selected to succeed Emperor An after Emperor An&#x27;s sudden death in April 125, but died soon after he became emperor and a eunuch coup in favour of Emperor Shun overthrew the regime of Empress Dowager Yan, who put him on the throne.

No historical records indicate his age, but later references to him imply that he was young, perhaps a child or young teenager. As his reign was short and considered at least somewhat illegitimate, he is often omitted from the official list of emperors.

== Family background ==
It is not known when Liu Yi was born—other than he was described as young at the time he ascended the throne on 18 May 125 and therefore must have been born late in the reign of Emperor An. His father was Liu Shou (; died 26 April 120), Prince Hui of Jibei, who was the fifth son of Emperor Zhang, making him Emperor An&#x27;s cousin. Liu Shou&#x27;s mother, Consort Shen, held the rank of &quot;guiren&quot;. Nothing is known about Liu Yi&#x27;s mother. He was likely created a marquess in 120, when five brothers of his oldest brother, Liu Deng (劉登; died 8 August 135), Prince Jie of Jibei, were created marquesses.

== Brief reign and posthumous developments ==
Empress Dowager Yan&#x27;s decision was supported by other powerful people trusted by Emperor An—his stepuncle Geng Bao (耿寶), the eunuchs Jiang Jing (江京) and Fan Feng (樊豐), and his wet nurse Wang Sheng (王聖). Soon, however, Empress Yan and her brother Yan Xian (閻顯) wanted to have full control of power, and they falsely accused Fan, Wang, and Geng of crimes. Fan was executed, while Wang and Geng, along with their families, were exiled. The Yan brothers became the most powerful officials in the capital Luoyang and ruled autocratically.

Late in the year, however, the young emperor grew gravely ill, and eunuchs loyal to Prince Bao, led by Sun Cheng (孫程), formed a conspiracy to overthrow the Yans. As soon as the emperor died, the eunuchs overthrew the Yans in a coup d&#x27;état and made Prince Bao emperor (as Emperor Shun). The Yans were slaughtered, except for Empress Dowager Yan, who was however rendered powerless.

Emperor Shun, recognizing that the former Marquess of Beixiang was young and not complicit in Empress Yan&#x27;s plot, did not posthumously dishonor him or carry out reprisals against his family, but nor did he recognize his predecessor as a legitimate emperor. Later in the year, he had the former emperor buried with the honors of an imperial prince—in other words, higher than of his previous title of marquess but lower than that of an emperor. No official posthumous name was recorded for this young emperor.

In 136, about ten years after his death, the empire experienced several natural disasters and unusual occurrences. Emperor Shun thought that these occurrences were caused by Liu Yi&#x27;s spirit as he felt that he had been unjustly treated, having once been emperor and yet was buried with the honors of an imperial prince. The emperor then discussed with court officials about giving Liu Yi a posthumous name, as well as recognizing his rule as emperor. Initially, the court agreed with Emperor Shun. However, official Zhou Ju () objected and his arguments were eventually supported by 70 others. In the end, Emperor Shun agreed with Zhou.

<text>John William Weller (born 25 May 1958), better known as Paul Weller, is an English singer-songwriter and musician. Weller achieved fame with the rock band the Jam in the late 1970s. Following the dissolution of the Jam in 1982, he pursued different musical styles in the Style Council (1983–1989), then became a solo artist with his eponymous 1992 studio album.

Though Weller has received international critical recognition as a singer, lyricist, and guitarist, much of his notoriety is in his native England, as his songwriting is rooted in English society. Many of his songs with the Jam had lyrics about working class life. He was the principal figure of the 1970s and 1980s mod revival, often referred to as the Modfather, and an influence on Britpop bands such as Oasis. He has received four Brit Awards, including Best British Male three times, and the Brit Award 2006 for Outstanding Contribution to Music.

== Early life (1958–1975) ==
Weller was born on 25 May 1958 in Woking, Surrey, England, to John and Ann Weller (née Craddock). Although born John William Weller, he became known as Paul by his parents.

Weller&#x27;s father worked as a taxi driver and a builder and his mother was a part-time cleaner. He started his education at Maybury County First School. His love of music began with the Beatles, then the Who and the Small Faces. When Weller was eleven he moved up to Sheerwater County Secondary school and had started playing the guitar.

Weller&#x27;s musical vocation was confirmed after seeing Status Quo in concert in 1972.
He formed the first incarnation of the Jam, playing bass guitar with his school friends Steve Brookes (lead guitar), Dave Waller (rhythm guitar) and Neil Harris (drums), playing sets at school and their local youth club. When Harris and then Waller left the band, two more school friends replaced them: Rick Buckler on drums and Bruce Foxton on rhythm guitar. Weller&#x27;s father, acting as their manager, began booking the four-piece into local working men&#x27;s clubs, and the band began to forge a local reputation, playing a mixture of covers and songs written by Weller and Brookes. After Brookes left the band in 1976, Weller and Foxton decided to swap guitar roles, with Weller now the guitarist.

Weller became interested in 1960s mod subculture in late 1974, particularly after hearing &quot;My Generation&quot; by the Who. As a result, he began riding a Lambretta scooter, styling his hair like Steve Marriott and immersing himself in 1960s soul and R&amp;B music. At his instigation, the Jam began wearing mohair suits onstage and he and Foxton began playing Rickenbacker guitars (as favoured by the Who and the Beatles in the mid-1960s). He has been a committed mod ever since, declaring in a 1991 interview that, &quot;I&#x27;ll always be a mod. You can bury me a mod&quot;.

== The Jam (1976–1982) ==

The Jam emerged at the same time as punk rock bands such as the Clash, the Damned, and the Sex Pistols. The Clash were early advocates of the band, and added them as the support on their White Riot tour in May 1977.
The Jam&#x27;s first single, &quot;In the City&quot;, took them into the UK Top 40 in May 1977. In 1979, the group released &quot;The Eton Rifles&quot; and first broke into the Top 10, hitting the No. 3 spot in November. The increasing popularity of their blend of Weller&#x27;s barbed lyrics with pop melodies eventually led to their first number one single, &quot;Going Underground&quot;, in March 1980.

The Jam became the first band since the Beatles to perform both sides of the same single (&quot;Town Called Malice&quot; and &quot;Precious&quot;) on one edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. They also had two singles, &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; (1981) and &quot;Just Who Is the 5 O&#x27;Clock Hero?&quot; (1982), reach No. 21 and No. 8 respectively in the UK singles chart despite not being released as singles in the UK—on the strength of import sales of the German single releases. At that time, &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; was the best-selling import-only single to date in the UK charts.
Having already told Buckler and Foxton that he was leaving the band, in October 1982 Weller announced that the Jam would disband at the end of that year. Although Weller was determined to end the band and move on, the action came as a surprise to Foxton and Buckler who both felt that the band had scope to develop further professionally. Their final single, &quot;Beat Surrender&quot;, became their fourth UK chart topper, going to No. 1 in its first week. Their farewell concerts at Wembley Arena were multiple sell-outs; their final concert took place at the Brighton Centre on 11 December 1982.

== The Style Council (1983–1989) ==

In 1983, Weller teamed up with keyboardist Mick Talbot to form a new group called the Style Council. Weller brought in Steve White to play drums, as well as singer Dee C. Lee, who later became Weller&#x27;s girlfriend and then wife. She also had previously been a backing vocalist with Wham!

Free of the limited musical styles he felt imposed by the Jam, under the collective of the Style Council, Weller was able to experiment with a wide range of music, including jazz, blue-eyed soul, and house; he also brought in musicians and vocalists to produce a different sound on each track. The Style Council also used synthesizers and drum machines to create their musical style, which would later be labelled as sophisti-pop.

Many of the Style Council&#x27;s early singles performed well in the UK charts, and Weller would also experience his first success in North America, when &quot;My Ever Changing Moods&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re the Best Thing&quot; entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Weller appeared on 1984&#x27;s Band Aid record &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, and the Style Council appeared in the British half of Live Aid at Wembley Stadium in 1985.

In December 1984, Weller put together his own charity ensemble called the Council Collective to make a record, &quot;Soul Deep&quot;, to raise money for striking miners, and the family of David Wilkie, a Welsh taxi driver who was killed during said strike. The record featured the Style Council plus a number of other performers, notably Jimmy Ruffin and Junior Giscombe, and peaked at No. 24 on the UK singles chart.

As the 1980s wore on, the Style Council&#x27;s popularity in the UK began to slide, with the band achieving only one top ten single after 1985. The Style Council&#x27;s death knell was sounded in 1989 when its record company refused to release its fifth and final studio album, the house-influenced &quot;&quot;. With the rejection of this effort, Weller announced that the Style Council had split. It was not until the 1998 retrospective CD box set &quot;The Complete Adventures of the Style Council&quot; that the album would be widely available.

== Solo career (1990–present) ==
=== Early solo career (1990–1995) ===
In 1989, Weller found himself without a band and without a recording contract for the first time since he was 17. After taking time off for most of 1990, he returned to the road late in the year, touring as &quot;The Paul Weller Movement&quot; with long-term drummer and friend Steve White and Paul Francis (session bassist from the James Taylor Quartet). After a slow start playing small clubs with a mixture of Jam and Style Council classics, as well as showcasing new material, he released his debut solo single, &quot;Into Tomorrow&quot;, which peaked at No. 36 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1991. His next single, &quot;Uh Huh Oh Yeh&quot;, reached No. 18 in the UK Chart in August 1992, followed by his debut solo studio album, &quot;Paul Weller&quot;, peaking at No. 8 on the UK Chart in September that year.

Buoyed by the positive commercial and critical success of his debut solo studio album, Weller returned to the studio in 1993 with a renewed confidence, recording most of the tracks on his next album in one take. Accompanied by Steve White, guitarist Steve Cradock and bassist Marco Nelson, the result of these sessions was the triumphant Mercury Music Prize-nominated &quot;Wild Wood&quot;, which included the singles &quot;Sunflower&quot; and &quot;Wild Wood&quot;. Weller&#x27;s first solo live album, &quot;Live Wood&quot;, was released in 1994, peaking at No. 13 in the UK Albums Chart. 

Weller&#x27;s third solo studio album &quot;Stanley Road&quot; (1995) took him back to the top of the British charts for the first time in a decade, and went on to become the best-selling album of his career. The album, named after the street in Woking where he had grown up, marked a return to the more guitar-based style of his earlier days. The album&#x27;s major single, &quot;The Changingman&quot;, was also a big hit, taking Weller to No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart. Another single, the ballad &quot;You Do Something to Me&quot;, was his second consecutive Top 10 single and reached No. 9 in the UK.

Weller found himself heavily associated with the emerging Britpop movement. Noel Gallagher of Oasis is credited as guest guitarist on the &quot;Stanley Road&quot; album track &quot;I Walk on Gilded Splinters&quot;. Weller also returned the favour, appearing as a guest guitarist on Oasis&#x27; hit song &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; from their second studio album &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;.

=== The Modfather (1996–2007) ===

&quot;Heavy Soul&quot;, the follow-up to the million-selling &quot;Stanley Road&quot;, was a &#x27;rootsy&#x27;, &#x27;stripped-down&#x27; change in Weller&#x27;s musical style, compared to its predecessor. The first single &quot;Peacock Suit&quot; reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart, in 1996 and the album reached No. 2 in 1997. Success in the UK charts also came from compilations: &quot;Best Of&quot; albums by the Jam and the Style Council charted, and in 1998 his own solo collection, &quot;Modern Classics,&quot; peaked at No. 7.

In 2000 he released his fifth solo studio album, &quot;Heliocentric&quot;, which debuted and peaked at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart. On his worldwide &quot;Days of Speed&quot; acoustic tour, Weller performed songs from the back catalogue of his solo career and from his Jam and Style Council days, giving rise to a second successful live album of the same name; containing live solo acoustic recordings from the European leg of the tour, the album reached No. 3 in the UK Albums Chart in October 2001.

Weller released the No. 1 hit album &quot;Illumination&quot; in September 2002. Co-produced by Noonday Underground&#x27;s Simon Dine, it was preceded by top 10 hit single &quot;It&#x27;s Written in the Stars&quot;. Weller also appears on Noonday Underground&#x27;s second studio album called &quot;Surface Noise&quot; (2002), singing on the track &quot;I&#x27;ll Walk Right On&quot;.

In 2002, Weller collaborated with Terry Callier on the single &quot;Brother to Brother&quot;, which featured on Callier&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Speak Your Peace&quot;. That same year, he teamed up with electronic rock duo Death in Vegas on a cover of Gene Clark&#x27;s &quot;So You Say You Lost Your Baby&quot;, which featured on their third studio album &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot;.

Weller&#x27;s album of covers entitled &quot;Studio 150&quot;, debuted at No. 2 in the UK charts in 2004, and included Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; as well as covers of songs by Gil Scott-Heron and Rose Royce, amongst others.

Weller&#x27;s eighth solo studio album &quot;As Is Now&quot; (2005) featured the singles &quot;From the Floorboards Up&quot;, &quot;Come On/Let&#x27;s Go&quot; and &quot;Here&#x27;s the Good News&quot;. The album was well-received, reaching No. 4 in the UK charts, though critics noted that he was not moving his music forward stylistically.

At the Brit Awards on 14 February 2006 at Earl&#x27;s Court in London, he was the latest recipient of the Outstanding Contribution to Music Award. Despite a tendency to shun such occasions, Weller accepted the award in person, and performed four songs at the ceremony, including the Jam&#x27;s classic &quot;Town Called Malice&quot;. Double live album &quot;Catch-Flame!&quot; was released in June that year, featuring songs from his solo work and his career with the Jam and the Style Council. Compilation album &quot;Hit Parade&quot;, released in late 2006, collected singles from the Jam, the Style Council and Weller&#x27;s solo career. Weller was offered appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2006 birthday honours, but rejected the offer.

In 2007, Weller was a guest vocalist on the song &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; by the folk music project the Imagined Village, with Martin Carthy and Eliza Carthy also being credited as main artists. It was released on the band&#x27;s eponymous debut studio album.

=== Critical success (2008–present) ===

The double studio album &quot;22 Dreams&quot; was released on 2 June 2008, with &quot;Echoes Round the Sun&quot; as the lead single. Weller had parted company with his existing band before the recording this album, replacing everyone except guitarist Steve Cradock with Andy Lewis on bass, Andy Crofts of the Moons on keyboards and Steve Pilgrim of the Stands on drums. This album saw Weller move in a more experimental direction, taking in a wide variety of influences including jazz, folk and tango as well as the pop-soul more associated with his Style Council days. Weller also featured on two songs from the Moons&#x27; debut studio album &quot;Life on Earth&quot; (2010), playing piano on &quot;Wondering&quot; and lead guitar on &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot;.

Weller was the surprise recipient of the 2009 Brit Award for British Male Solo Artist, which resulted in controversy when it was discovered that a suspiciously high number of bets had been placed for Weller to win the award, for which James Morrison was T4&#x27;s favourite. It was reported that the bookmakers had lost £100,000 in the event, and that as a result would not be taking bets for the awards in the future.

In 2009, Weller guested on Dot Allison&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Room 7½&quot; (2009), co-writing &quot;Love&#x27;s Got Me Crazy&quot;. November and December also saw him on tour, playing shows across the country.

On 24 February 2010, Weller received the Godlike Genius Award at the &quot;NME&quot; Awards. His tenth studio album, &quot;Wake Up the Nation&quot;, was released in April to critical acclaim, and was subsequently nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. The album also marked his first collaboration with Jam bassist Bruce Foxton in 28 years. In May 2010, Weller was presented with the Ivor Novello Lifetime Achievement award, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve enjoyed the last 33 years I&#x27;ve been writing songs and hopefully, with God&#x27;s good grace, I&#x27;ll do some more.&quot;

On 19 March 2012 Weller released his eleventh studio album &quot;Sonik Kicks&quot;. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1. On 17 December 2012 Weller released the &quot;Dragonfly&quot; EP, a limited edition vinyl run of 3000 copies. Weller provided vocals on the Moons&#x27; 2012 single &quot;Something Soon&quot;. In December 2012, Weller headlined the Crisis charity gig at the Hammersmith Apollo, where he performed with Emeli Sandé, Miles Kane and Bradley Wiggins. On 23 March 2013, Weller played drums on stage with Damon Albarn, Noel Gallagher and Graham Coxon, playing the Blur track &quot;Tender&quot;. This was played as part of the Teenage Cancer Trust concerts curated by Noel Gallagher.

In 2014, Weller wrote &quot;Let Me In&quot; with Olly Murs for Murs&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Never Been Better&quot;.
In 2015, Weller made a West Coast tour of the US to promote his &quot;Saturns Pattern&quot; studio album. The tour ran from 9 June to 9 October. In January 2017 he made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, the final episode of series four of the BBC TV series &quot;Sherlock&quot;. On 8 March 2019, audio and video versions of &quot;Other Aspects, Live at the Royal Festival Hall&quot; was released. It is the second of two shows and was recorded in October 2018 at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall with an orchestra.

Weller&#x27;s fifteenth solo studio album, &quot;On Sunset&quot;, was released 3 July 2020 and debuted atop the UK Albums Chart, giving Weller UK number-one albums spanning five consecutive decades. He joins the Beatles&#x27; John Lennon and Paul McCartney in having the distinction. His number-one albums: &quot;The Gift&quot;, as part of the Jam (1982). &quot;Our Favourite Shop&quot;, as part of the Style Council (1985), and solo studio albums &quot;Stanley Road&quot; (1995), &quot;Illumination&quot; (2002), &quot;22 Dreams&quot; (2008), &quot;Sonik Kicks&quot; (2012), and &quot;On Sunset&quot; (2020). Weller&#x27;s sixteenth solo studio album, &quot;Fat Pop (Volume 1)&quot;, was released to critical acclaim on 14 May 2021, and entered the charts at number 1. On 15 May 2021, Weller recorded live symphonic renditions of songs from his catalogue at the Barbican Centre in London with Jules Buckley and the BBC Symphony Orchestra. A live album of the recording session, &quot;An Orchestrated Songbook&quot;, was released in December 2021.

On 28 October 2022, Weller released a B-sides and rarities album &quot;Will of the People&quot;. He collaborated on the songs with Richard Fearless, Young Fathers, Straightface and Stone Foundation.

In early 2024, Weller announced that his next studio album, &quot;66&quot;, would be released in May, the day before his 66th birthday. Recording took three years in Weller&#x27;s Surrey studio, Black Barn. The album includes collaborations with Dr. Robert of the Blow Monkeys, Richard Hawley, Erland Cooper, Max Beesley, Suggs of Madness, Noel Gallagher and Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream, with string arrangements by Hannah Peel. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Soul Wandering&quot;, was released on 23 February 2024.

He made his feature film debut in Steve McQueen&#x27;s historical war drama &quot;Blitz&quot;, released in 2024.

== Influences ==
Weller&#x27;s formative influences that have remained relatively constant include the Beatles, the Who, the Small Faces and the Kinks, as well as the mid-late 1960s soul and R&amp;B records released by Tamla Motown and Stax.

During the Jam years, Weller was influenced by early punk bands, including the Sex Pistols and the Clash, and later post-punk acts such as Gang of Four and Joy Division. During the final part of the Jam&#x27;s career, he introduced more contemporary soul and funk into the band&#x27;s music, with Spandau Ballet&#x27;s &quot;Chant No. 1 (I Don&#x27;t Need This Pressure On)&quot; and Pigbag&#x27;s &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Pigbag&quot; inspiring Jam tracks, including &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; and &quot;Precious&quot;. Weller&#x27;s inspiration also came from 1970s soul and funk artists—most notably Curtis Mayfield.

Weller has worked various literary influences into his work, such as George Orwell&#x27;s work together with a short story written by Weller&#x27;s friend Dave Waller, providing inspiration for the Jam&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Setting Sons&quot; (1979). Weller has also cited Geoffrey Ashe&#x27;s &quot;Camelot and the Vision of Albion&quot; (1971), Orwell and Percy Bysshe Shelley as sources of inspiration for the Jam&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Sound Affects&quot; (1980).

Jazz influenced Weller&#x27;s work during the early Style Council years, and he has cited John Coltrane as one of his favourites, saying &quot;I love all of his stuff from &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; onwards.&quot; His tastes became increasingly eclectic during his Style Council period, with releases influenced by music as diverse as Claude Debussy, Philadelphia soul and Erik Satie, culminating in the band&#x27;s American house music-inspired album &quot;&quot;.

During the 1990s, Weller&#x27;s work began being influenced by late 1960s and early 1970s artists such as Neil Young, Nick Drake, and Traffic. He has also embraced the influence of David Bowie, despite having once said that all but three of his records were &quot;pish&quot;.

Despite telling &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine in 2000 that he did not &quot;make music with fuzzy radios or electric spoons&quot;, since then, he has incorporated experimental influences into his music, citing Pierre Schaeffer and Karlheinz Stockhausen as major influences for &quot;On Sunset&quot;″s experimental tracks. Additionally, &quot;Mojo&quot; has noted Neu!&#x27;s influence on &quot;Sonik Kicks&quot;&#x27; &quot;Green&quot; and &quot;Around the Lake&quot;. 

Among the many albums that Weller has cited as all-time favourites are &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; (1968), &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967), &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; (1971) , &quot;Innervisions&quot; (1973), &quot;Low&quot; (1977), &quot;Journey in Satchidananda&quot; (1971), &quot;The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot; (1968), the Small Faces eponymous 1967 album, Traffic&#x27;s eponymous 1968 album, &quot;McCartney&quot; (1970), &quot;Down by the Jetty&quot; (1975), and &quot;My Generation&quot; (1965). Other songs he has nominated as favourites include the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, the Small Faces&#x27; &quot;Tin Soldier&quot;, James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine&quot;, Declan O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s &quot;Galileo (Someone Like You)&quot;, the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; and &quot;Days&quot;, and Pharrell Williams&#x27; &quot;Happy&quot;.

In 2012, Weller invaded a live radio interview with singer-songwriter Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan to praise his songs &quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot; and &quot;Nothing Rhymed&quot; as &quot;two of my favourite songs, great lyrics, great tunes&quot;.

Weller&#x27;s favourite film is Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971).

== Personal life ==
Between the summer of 1977 and around August 1985, Weller was in a relationship with Gill Price, a fashion designer from Bromley. She and their relationship inspired several Jam songs, including &quot;I Need You (For Someone)&quot;, &quot;Aunties &amp; Uncles&quot;, &quot;English Rose&quot;, &quot;Fly&quot;, and &quot;Happy Together&quot;. She worked in the Jam&#x27;s offices, contributed to Weller&#x27;s fanzines, and frequently toured with them—she can be seen in various behind-the-scenes photos. She appeared on the sleeve of the final Jam single, &quot;Beat Surrender&quot;, and along with Weller&#x27;s sister Nicky, she also had a cameo in the music video for the Style Council&#x27;s &quot;My Ever Changing Moods&quot;.

At the height of the Style Council&#x27;s success, Weller and Dee C. Lee, the Style Council&#x27;s backing vocalist, began a romantic relationship. The couple married in 1987 and divorced in 1998. They have a son and a daughter.

Weller has another daughter with make-up artist Lucy Halperin.

Weller became involved with Samantha Stock whilst he was recording at the Manor studio; they had two children together.

In October 2008, Stock and Weller broke up and Weller moved in with Hannah Andrews, a backing vocalist on his &quot;22 Dreams&quot; studio album, who has also toured with his band. They first met in New York in 2005 and married in September 2010 on the Italian island of Capri. The couple have twin boys who were born in 2012, and a daughter, born in 2017.

In April 2014, Weller won £10,000 in damages from Associated Newspapers after &quot;plainly voyeuristic&quot; photographs of his family out shopping were published on MailOnline.

On 24 April 2009, John Weller, his father and long-time manager since the days of the Jam, died from pneumonia at the age of 77.

Weller has been sober since 2010.

=== Political views and activism ===
Weller has a long association with British politics. In the Jam&#x27;s first &quot;NME&quot; interview in May 1977, he famously announced that the band would vote for the Conservative Party at the next election, something he has long since stated was a joke.

From late 1980, he became increasingly interested in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), often being pictured wearing a CND badge (as in the music video for &quot;Town Called Malice&quot;) and playing rallies with both the Jam and the Style Council. In tandem, he became more vocally socialist in interviews, and between around 1982 and 1987, his songwriting also became increasingly politicised, most notably on &quot;Trans-Global Express&quot;, &quot;Money-Go-Round&quot;, &quot;The Big Boss Groove&quot;, &quot;Soul Deep&quot; and the majority of &quot;Our Favourite Shop&quot;.

In late 1984, Weller took part in Band Aid and then put together his own benefit record for the UK miners&#x27; strike, which was called &quot;Soul Deep&quot; and credited to the Council Collective. The 12&quot; of the single featured interviews with striking miners, although half of the money raised went to the widow of David Wilkie, a taxi driver who was killed whilst driving strike-breaking miners to their shift. During the 1980s, Weller was also vegetarian and concerned with animal rights. As a result, he wrote the song &quot;Bloodsports&quot;, which was included on the B-side of the Style Council&#x27;s 1985 single, &quot;Walls Come Tumbling Down!&quot;. Royalties from the track were donated to a defence fund for two hunt saboteurs then on remand in HM Prison Bristol.

From the latter half of 1985, Weller was highly involved in the formation of Red Wedge, a left-wing collective of musicians and actors etc. who aimed to &quot;bring left-wing ideas to other people&quot;. From around 1988 onwards, he became less politically vocal, ultimately stating during the 1990s that he no longer particularly believed in any politics.

In 2008, after then-Conservative leader and former Eton pupil David Cameron chose the Jam&#x27;s &quot;The Eton Rifles&quot; as one of his &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, Weller expressed disgust, saying, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t intended as a fucking jolly drinking song for the cadet corps.&quot; When asked about it again in 2015, he told &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine: &quot;The whole thing with Cameron saying it was one of his favourite songs ... I just think, &#x27;Which bit didn&#x27;t you get?&quot; Weller also began playing the song live again for the first time since 1982.

In a 2008 interview, Weller said he had declined a CBE because of his dislike of the royal family, the Establishment and the Civil Service.

During the mid-2010s, Weller made a brief return to the political arena, being vocally supportive of then-Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and even playing a &#x27;Concert for Corbyn&#x27; in December 2016.

In a &quot;Guardian&quot; interview in the run-up to the 2024 general election, Weller commented on the British political landscape: &quot;You can either vote for Rishi Sunak&#x27;s Tory party, or you can vote for Keir Starmer&#x27;s Tory party.&quot; Weller also labelled Sunak, Starmer and Nigel Farage &quot;[m]ugs&quot; and criticised the actions of Israel in the same interview, stating: &quot;Am I against genocides and ethnic cleansing? Yes, I am, funnily enough, I can&#x27;t understand why more people aren&#x27;t up in arms about what&#x27;s going on. We should be ashamed of ourselves, I think. One minute you&#x27;re supplying bullets and bombs and guns, and then you&#x27;re sending over food. How does that work?&quot;

== Recognition and influence ==
In 2007, the BBC described Weller as &quot;one of the most revered music writers and performers of the past 30 years&quot;. In 2015, Pete Naughton of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote, &quot;Apart from David Bowie, it&#x27;s hard to think of any British solo artist who&#x27;s had as varied, long-lasting and determinedly forward-looking a career.&quot;

In 2012, he was among the British notables selected by the artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover—to celebrate the British social figures of his life.

<text>Brookfield Place (previously named and still commonly referred to as the World Financial Center) is a shopping center and office building complex in the New York City borough of Manhattan. It is located in the Battery Park City neighborhood, across West Street from the World Trade Center, and overlooks the Hudson River. The complex is currently owned and managed by Brookfield Properties, a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management.

== History ==

Designed by architect César Pelli, with Adamson Associates, the World Financial Center complex was built by Olympia and York from 1983 to 1988 on the landfill used to build Battery Park City.

During the September 11 attacks in 2001, debris severely damaged the lobby and lower floors&#x27; granite cladding and glass. It has since been fully restored and significant repairs were made to the other buildings in the complex. The Winter Garden Atrium received major structural damage to its glass and steel frame, but ceremonially reopened on September 11, 2002.

After the attacks, the World Financial Center underwent a $250 million renovation and expansion project, in conjunction with the construction of a new east–west passageway linking the complex with the World Trade Center site. The project included a transit pavilion to be built as an extension of the existing Winter Garden Atrium, on the West Street side. Preliminary plans called for the demolition of the Grand Staircase, which was the main focal entry point to Winter Garden and the waterfront, as it connected to the Vesey Street pedestrian bridge adjacent to the original World Trade Center. The Grand Staircase has also been used as an amphitheater; thus, the plans for demolition had outraged residents, who promptly appealed for its preservation in the latest redevelopment plans. The transit pavilion opened in 2013, and is located at 100 West Street.

Leasable space on the lower floors of the office towers underwent conversions and expansion to accommodate new retail. One notable example is 2 Brookfield Place: a European-style marketplace and dining terrace opened in 2013. The space between 3 and 4 Brookfield Place, at 225 Vesey Street, which contained retail, expanded to accommodate in‑line retail and high-end fashion retail, according to the plans and renderings. With some restaurants and retail temporarily closed due to construction, a food truck court was in operation beginning in early 2012 on North End Avenue. Various food trucks that operate around New York City, serving a variety of foods, service the Brookfield Place/Battery Park City area five days a week during lunch hours. A new 2,000-seat food court comprising existing restaurants, such as Le District and Hudson Eats, and new restaurants, opened in stages between November 2014 and March 2015; the food area is projected to generate about $120 million of revenue annually. Le District includes the Michelin-starred restaurant L&#x27;Appart. Overall, the intent is to drive more tourism in the area with the retail and the new access to the passageway under West Street. It is also being developed as a catalyst to integrate and drive development in the adjacent largely residential Battery Park City area.

Brookfield Properties bought the adjacent One North End Avenue building, headquarters of the New York Mercantile Exchange, in 2013, for , and integrated it into the complex. Following expansion, the entire World Financial Center complex was renamed Brookfield Place, in conjunction with similar complexes in Toronto, Calgary, and Perth owned by Brookfield. The name change took place in 2014.

== Ownership ==
Brookfield Place is owned by Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management, except for the space occupied by American Express, which is owned by the American Express Company. 250 Vesey Street serves as the United States headquarters for Brookfield Asset Management. Brookfield Place has its own zip code, 10281. The buildings&#x27; original developer was Olympia and York, also based in Toronto.

== Notable tenants ==
Brookfield Place has been home to offices of various companies including Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Oppenheimer &amp; Co., RBC Capital Markets, Nomura Group, American Express, Institute of Culinary Education, Bank of New York Mellon, Jane Street Capital, Time Inc. 95.5 K-LOVE, 96.7 Air1, and Brookfield Asset Management. In 2014, the complex was given its current name following the completion of extensive renovations. Brookfield Place is also the home of College Board, the nonprofit managing both Advanced Placement and the SAT.

== List of buildings ==
The Winter Garden Atrium is a glass domed pavilion housing various plants, trees and flowers, also shopping areas, cafes (located between buildings 2 and 3), rebuilt 2002 after terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The pavilion also exhibits a range of contemporary artists including Reyna Noriega, Julia Whitney Barnes, Tatiana Arocha, Anne Beffel, Jane Benson, Curtis Cuffie, Charles Goldman, Elke Lehmann, Pia Lindman, Brian P. McGrath, Andrea Ray, and Alex Villar.

<doc id="343487" wikidata="Q358365" url="?curid=343487" title="Charles III of Navarre">
<text>Charles III (, ; 22 July 1361 – 8 September 1425), called the Noble, was King of Navarre from 1387 to his death and Count of Évreux in France from 1387 to 1404, when he exchanged Évreux for the Duchy of Nemours.

As a young man, Charles was frequently sent by his father, King Charles II, to act as the envoy to France, where the family had vested interests both as fief holders and princes of the blood royal. Following Charles II&#x27;s dismal reign, Charles III set out to improve Navarre&#x27;s infrastructure, restore its pride, and mend strained relations with France. While he may have seen himself primarily as a French prince, particularly early on, the focus of the Navarrese foreign policy during Charles III&#x27;s reign gradually shifted towards Navarre&#x27;s neighbours in the Iberian Peninsula.

Charles&#x27;s personal life was somewhat turbulent. His marriage to Eleanor of Castile suffered a long crisis early in his reign over the status of their daughters and his illegitimate children; the couple reconciled after Charles affirmed their daughters&#x27; exclusive right to succeed him. Charles skillfully secured a balanced web of alliances through the marriages of his sisters and daughters to French lords and Iberian princes, ensuring a long-lasting peace in Navarre. He strove to increase the royal prestige through art patronage, court extravagance, and construction works. Having outlived most of his children, he was succeeded by his third daughter, Blanche I.

==Background and childhood==
A member of the House of Évreux, a cadet branch of the French royal House of Capet, Charles III was the firstborn son of King Charles II of Navarre and the French princess Joan of Valois. He was born at Mantes, the heart of his father&#x27;s patrimonial lands in northern France, on 22 July 1361. His parents were there on one of their long stays, managing the County of Évreux and other fiefs during the first phase (1337–1360) of France&#x27;s Hundred Years&#x27; War against England. Since 1234, the Kingdom of Navarre had been ruled by monarchs of French extraction, who reformed the kingdom&#x27;s administration, increased its international prestige, and strengthened the position of the monarchy, but also caused concern among their Iberian subjects by their long absences from the kingdom in favor of their possessions in France.

King Charles II returned to Navarre in November 1361, leaving his wife and son behind in France. When in January 1363 it was her turn to move to Navarre, Queen Joan left Charles in the custody of his aunt Blanche, sister of his father and widow of his maternal great-grandfather King Philip VI of France. Charles was reunited with his mother when she returned to France in December 1365, and the following August Charles set foot in his father&#x27;s kingdom for the first time.
Charles&#x27;s parents repeatedly went back and forth between the family&#x27;s French fiefs and Iberian kingdom; during his father&#x27;s absence in 1369, Charles was already titled lieutenant of the kingdom despite his young age. Navarre paid a high price in King Charles II&#x27;s conflict with Kings John II and Charles V of France, his father-in-law and brother-in-law respectively, over his ancestral claim to the County of Champagne and even the Kingdom of France, as well as over Queen Joan&#x27;s dowry. The suffering of the populace was exacerbated by problems common throughout Europe at that time, from worsening climate to disease and food shortages. Queen Joan died suddenly on a diplomatic mission to her brother the French king in November 1373.

==Marriage==
On 27 May 1375, in the Castilian town of Soria, Charles married Eleanor, daughter of King Henry II of Castile, sealing the peace between their fathers. Both Charles and Eleanor were in their early teen years at the time of their wedding. She remained in Castile, where Charles visited her when he was not in Navarre or representing his father at the French royal court in Paris. 

In 1378, Charles was sent by his father on an embassy to King Charles V of France. The king of France had his nephew arrested and the Évreux possessions in France embargoed, except Cherbourg, which the king of Navarre had leased to the English. During an interrogation, the young Charles revealed his father&#x27;s plan to seize the Castilian (formerly Navarrese) town of Logroño. The king of France alerted the king of Castile to the plot, and the latter promptly invaded Navarre and forced its king to sign the Treaty of Briones. Eleanor played a key role in securing Charles&#x27;s release in 1381 by having her brother King John I of Castile exert diplomatic pressure on France. Upon his release, Charles joined Eleanor in Castile.

Charles and Eleanor&#x27;s first child, a daughter named Joan, was born in Castile in November 1382. Two more daughters were born to the young couple in Castile: Marie, in 1383 or 1384, and Blanche, in August 1385. Twin daughters were born to the couple the following year, but only one, named Beatrice, survived infancy.

==Reign==

Charles III became king of Navarre and count of Évreux upon the death of his father on 1 January 1387; the same year he recovered from the Crown of Castile the last Castilian-occupied parts of Navarre. 
===Marital problems===
The early years of Charles III&#x27;s reign were marred by the breakdown of his relationship with his wife, Eleanor. She and their daughters joined him in Navarre upon his accession, but the new queen soon fell gravely ill. She returned to Castile as soon as her health began to improve and took the princesses with her. Her refusal to return for the next seven years, despite embassies sent by Charles, damaged the relations between her husband and her brother King John I of Castile. When the latter became exasperated by her abandonment of her &quot;great obligations&quot;, she claimed that Charles failed to receive her and treat her as befit her. According to a chronicle of John&#x27;s reign, she even accused Charles of pressuring her to take herbs from a Jewish physician in an attempt to poison her. Historian Elena Woodacre posits that the rift between Charles and Eleanor was caused by his illegitimate children. When she arrived in Navarre, Eleanor found Charles&#x27;s four mistresses and six illegitimate children living with their retainers at the court. The queen was likely worried that her daughters&#x27; rights to succeed their father would be threatened by his illegitimate infant son, Lancelot, despite illegitimate children being barred from succession by the &quot;Fueros&quot;.

Still estranged from Eleanor, Charles underwent coronation alone in 1390. From that year on, Charles made a series of moves to repair his marriage, the first of which was to assure Eleanor that he intended to be succeeded by the issue of their marriage. He summoned their eldest daughter, Joan, to Navarre to be sworn in as heir presumptive to the throne. The ceremony, attended by the nobility of Navarre and Castilian envoys, was held on 25 July. Eleanor did not find this sufficient, but the death of her brother John and the accession of her nephew King Henry III of Castile, who was less sympathetic to her cause, forced her to compromise. She demanded further assurances of her safety, and Charles accordingly swore on the Christian cross before Castilian representatives that he &quot;would not kill nor maim nor seize nor allow her to be killed or maimed or seized&quot; and that he &quot;would protect the life and health of the said queen with all of his power&quot; and &quot;otherwise treat [her] in all things as a good husband should treat his wife&quot;. Eleanor then returned to Navarre, reuniting with Charles in November 1394 in Tudela.

Soon after their reconciliation, Charles and Eleanor had another daughter, Isabel, born in July 1396. The following September, Charles affirmed the succession rights of all five of their daughters. The birth of long-awaited sons, Charles in June 1397 and Louis in 1402, was a triumph for the king and queen. The young Charles was confirmed as heir apparent to the throne, but both he and Louis died in 1402. The royal couple had another daughter, Margaret, the next year, and Charles held on to the hope that he would have a son with Eleanor until at least 1412. The king and queen appear to have had no disputes after Eleanor&#x27;s coronation in 1403, and Charles entrusted her with regency of the kingdom while he visited his French fiefs.

===Diplomacy===

In 1393, Charles procured a link to the Aragonese royal house by arranging for his sister Marie to marry Duke Alfonso II of Gandia. The same year, he secured the return of Cherbourg from the English and started negotiations with the French court about the settlement of his claims on land in France, which resulted in the exchange of the counties inherited by his father for various rents and the Duchy of Nemours. Charles III took an active part in European affairs as a prince of the blood of the royal house of France until 1406, after which he reoriented himself towards the Iberian Peninsula.

Charles excelled in diplomacy: much of the peace and prosperity Navarre enjoyed during his reign can be attributed to the matrimonial alliances he forged with his nobles and rulers in Iberia and southern France through his numerous female relatives. Between 1396 and 1406, he carefully arranged the marriages of two of his sisters and three of his legitimate daughters, who were his strongest assets in dynastic diplomacy. His illegitimate children, meanwhile, were married off into the Navarrese nobility to ensure their loyalty. Charles greatly profited even from the unions he did not orchestrate, such as his sister Joan&#x27;s successive marriages to Duke John IV of Brittany and King Henry IV of England. When Joan became queen of England in 1402, Charles gifted her with a copy of the manuscript &quot;Ceremonial of the Coronation, Anointment and Obsequies of the Kings of England&quot;.

===Succession plans===
From 1401 to 1402, Charles conducted marriage negotiations with King Martin of Aragon, whose only son, King Martin I of Sicily, had been recently widowed. Charles was flattered by the king of Aragon&#x27;s interest, for Martin had earlier rejected Queen Joan II of Naples as well as the daughters of Kings Rupert of Germany, Charles VI of France, and Henry IV of England. The selection of the third daughter, Blanche, ahead of her older sisters suggests that either Martin or Charles, or both, were not keen on creating a personal union between their kingdoms. Charles concurrently negotiated the marriage of Joan, his eldest daughter, with John, heir apparent to the County of Foix; the king may have preferred that Navarre be the primary partner in any potential union. Joan&#x27;s marriage to John was celebrated in October 1402, some months after the deaths of her brothers made her once again first in the line of succession. These two marriages, as well as that of Beatrice, the fourth daughter, to Count James II of La Marche in 1406, put a strain on Charles&#x27;s coffers, and his struggle to pay their dowries led to disputes with their respective in-laws, particularly the king of Aragon. 1406 also saw the death of Charles and Eleanor&#x27;s second daughter, Marie.

Charles entrusted the kingdom to Eleanor and their daughter Joan from 1408 to 1411, when he was seeking compensation from the French royal court for lost territories. When Blanche was widowed in 1409, Charles used his new connections at the French court to negotiate for her to marry the French king&#x27;s brother-in-law Louis of Bavaria or Edward of Bar. The death of his childless eldest daughter, Joan, in July 1413 prompted Charles to seek a closer match for Blanche, who became the new heir presumptive. To support his monarchy and manage the royal household, he appointed Lord Juan Vélaz de Medrano as his royal Chamberlain in 1414.

Blanche&#x27;s situation in Sicily was precarious after the deaths of her husband and father-in-law left her in charge of the unstable island kingdom in the name of the new king, Ferdinand I of Aragon, but without proper support from Aragon. Deeply concerned, Charles sent envoys to both Ferdinand and the Holy See asking that she either be returned to Navarre or provided with assistance. Blanche returned and was confirmed as heir presumptive before the &quot;Cortes&quot;. Charles refused Joan&#x27;s widower&#x27;s proposal to marry Blanche and instead in mid-1414 offered her in marriage to Alfonso, the eldest son of the new king of Aragon. Since Alfonso was already betrothed, Ferdinand suggested his third son, Henry. Charles indignantly refused the offer in August when Ferdinand&#x27;s second son, John, broke off his engagement to Charles&#x27;s younger daughter Isabel. Isabel was married off instead to Count John IV of Armagnac, signaling Charles&#x27;s shift in allegiance from the Burgundians to the Armagnac party during the on-going civil war in France. The change may have been prompted by Burgundy&#x27;s alliance with England, where Charles&#x27;s sister Joan was imprisoned on a charge of witchcraft after the death of her second husband, King Henry IV.

In 1416, following the examples of the kings of France, Castile, Aragon, and Portugal in dealing with the Western Schism, Charles III stopped recognizing the Avignon-based Benedict XIII as the true pope and switched his allegiance to Gregory XII, who ruled in Rome. Eleanor died the same year. 

The Aragonese remained determined to secure Blanche&#x27;s marriage for themselves. Their queen, Eleanor of Alburquerque, pushed for her second son, John, to marry Blanche. Their marriage was celebrated in October 1419, after months of intensive negotiations during which the princess&#x27;s position was reaffirmed. Charles promised not to remarry to sire sons who could displace Blanche. When Blanche gave birth to a son, Charles, the king celebrated by creating for him the Principality of Viana. Blanche soon had a daughter too, named Joan. King Charles held formal ceremonies marking the introduction of both grandchildren into the line of succession after Blanche.

===Last years===

Charles made great effort to exalt the monarchy through art patronage, extraordinary donations, and thaumaturgy. The construction of the Gothic Cathedral of Pamplona and of the royal palaces in Olite and Tafalla was finished at his instruction. In 1423, he ended the centuries of conflict between the city&#x27;s three boroughs by uniting them into one.

On 8 September 1425, having woken up healthy and cheerful, Charles III suddenly collapsed. He was able to call for Blanche, but lost the ability to speak by the time she arrived. He died in his daughter&#x27;s arms the same day. Blanche succeeded him without trouble. Charles was buried in the Cathedral of Pamplona by the side of his wife, Eleanor.

==Legacy==

Charles III left to his daughter a stable and prosperous realm. Whether he saw himself primarily as a French prince or an Iberian king remains debated by historians, but it is clear that he oversaw a steadily increasing Iberianization of Navarre. Traditional historiography portrays Charles III&#x27;s reign as a time of internal withdrawal, as opposed to his father&#x27;s active part in the Hundred Years&#x27; War; finance reforms, which restored a measure of prosperity and social contentment to the kingdom after Charles II&#x27;s turbulent reign; and courtly splendor. Charles III also demonstrated a significant aptitude for diplomacy. In contrast to his father, Charles &quot;the Bad&quot;, Charles III therefore earned the cognomen &quot;the Noble&quot;.

==Issue==
Charles had seven daughters and two sons with his wife, Eleanor of Castile:
*Joan (1382–1413), who was his heir presumptive and married to John I of Foix
*Maria (1383 or 1384–1406), who was gravely ill along with Eleanor in the immediate aftermath of Charles&#x27;s accession and remained in poor health throughout her life
*Blanche (1385–1441), Charles&#x27;s ultimate successor, who was married successively to Kings Martin I of Sicily and John II of Aragon
*Beatrice (1392–1412), married to Count James II of La Marche

<doc id="343490" wikidata="Q1977646" url="?curid=343490" title="The O'Reilly Factor">
<text>The O&#x27;Reilly Factor (originally titled The O&#x27;Reilly Report and also known as The Factor) was an American cable television news and talk show. &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; first aired in the United States on Fox News Channel on October 7, 1996, the same day the network launched. It was hosted by independent commentator Bill O&#x27;Reilly, who discussed current events and controversial political issues with guests. The final episode aired on April 21, 2017.

==Format==

&quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; was generally pre-recorded, though on occasion it aired live if breaking news or special events were being covered (e.g., presidential addresses that occurred during prime-time and debate coverage). It was usually taped between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time and aired weekdays at 8:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. The show was recorded &quot;live to tape&quot;, meaning that the recording broke for commercials as if the show was actually on the air while being recorded. Some guests were interviewed before the &quot;live to tape&quot; period and were slotted in the program as appropriate. He began every show with the catch phrase from September 2004 to April 11, 2017, &quot;Caution! You are about to enter the No Spin Zone. The Factor begins right now!&quot; followed by the theme song, and then saying &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Bill O&#x27;Reilly, thanks for watching us tonight,&quot; introducing the topic of the first segment, followed by &quot;and that is the subject of this evening&#x27;s Talking Points Memo&quot;, a monologue which was often followed with an interview on the same topic.

O&#x27;Reilly and his producers discussed potential topics twice a week. Guest hosts included: Eric Bolling, Monica Crowley, Greg Gutfeld, E. D. Hill, Laura Ingraham, John Kasich, Michelle Malkin, Tony Snow, and Juan Williams.

==Audience==

Early in 2009, the show&#x27;s ratings increased. In July 2009, Hal Boedeker blogged that &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; peaked at 3.1 million viewers which was an increase of 37% from the previous year. In September 2009, &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; was the #1 cable news show for 106 consecutive weeks. In May 2014, &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; still held this top position, but average monthly viewers were down to 2.1 million, with a median age of 72 years. In March 2015, &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; remained at the number one spot on cable news ratings for its 60th consecutive quarter, experiencing 19% growth in viewership among individuals aged 25 to 54 years old.

Ratings were initially high after sexual harassment allegations against O&#x27;Reilly resurfaced in April 2017. In the time during Bill O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s week-long vacation preceding his firing (in which Dana Perino guest hosted), the ratings dropped 26%.

==Notable guests==
Michelle Malkin was a frequent guest host. A conservative commentator, she began boycotting the show in 2007 due to controversy involving remarks made against her by Geraldo Rivera over her position on illegal immigration.

2008 presidential contenders

Fox News producers had tried for years to get Hillary Clinton to come on the show. On April 30, 2008, Clinton agreed to come on the show as part of a pre-taped interview that would be broadcast over two days. The host also held an exclusive, four-part interview with then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. Both interviews drew significant media attention as they were front runners for the 2008 presidential election. In the same election cycle, Ron Paul and O&#x27;Reilly got into a testy exchange over the issue of Iran. The 2008 Republican candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin, and then Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden were also invited to the show, but chose not to make an appearance.

==Cultural impact==
In 2005, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; premiered on Comedy Central. The show, hosted by Stephen Colbert, was a satirical spoof of pundit shows like &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, spoofing its format and the mannerisms and ideology of O&#x27;Reilly, whom Colbert called &quot;Papa Bear.&quot; Colbert made no secret of his spoofing O&#x27;Reilly: upon hearing the news that O&#x27;Reilly approved of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, he declared on-air that &quot;I like you too. In fact, if it wasn&#x27;t for you, this show wouldn&#x27;t exist.&quot; On January 18, 2007, Colbert appeared on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; and O&#x27;Reilly appeared on&quot; The Colbert Report&quot;. After O&#x27;Reilly left his show, the character Colbert played on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; appeared &quot;via satellite&quot; on his new show, &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, to bid a satirical farewell to Bill.

&quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; has also been spoofed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, first by Jeff Richards and later on by Darrell Hammond, and then with Alec Baldwin, where Baldwin played both O&#x27;Reilly and Donald Trump in the same sketch in an interview segment. On &quot;MADtv&quot;, the parody was by Michael McDonald. O&#x27;Reilly himself has appeared on &quot;MADtv&quot;. Richards also played O&#x27;Reilly in an episode of &quot;Mind of Mencia&quot; where O&#x27;Reilly is a senator in the year 2016. The show was also spoofed by the TV series &quot;The Boondocks&quot;; first in the episode &quot;The Trial of R. Kelly&quot; where O&#x27;Reilly is shown talking about R. Kelly&#x27;s latest legal trouble. Later in &quot;Return of the King&quot;, O&#x27;Reilly is shown attacking Martin Luther King Jr. for saying that America should &quot;love thy enemy&quot; and &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, even in respects to the 9/11 attacks. &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot; featured a segment in its second season where it poked fun at &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;.

==Cancellation==
After five sexual harassment settlements by O&#x27;Reilly and Fox News were reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; lost more than half its advertisers within a week; almost 60 companies withdrew their ads. Despite the loss of advertisers, &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;&#x27;s ratings increased during the controversy. On April 11, 2017, O&#x27;Reilly announced he would take a two-week vacation and would return to the program on April 24, 2017, His plans to return, however, would not come to pass, as he was fired eight days later, and his show was cancelled soon afterwards. Online, references to O&#x27;Reilly on FoxNews.com were immediately removed, with the main show website redirecting to the FoxNews.com homepage and its content removed. The program continued for three more episodes without O&#x27;Reilly, but the title was shortened to The Factor. Dana Perino guest hosted the show on April 19, 2017 and April 20, 2017 and Greg Gutfeld hosted the final episode on April 21, 2017.

In the April 19, 2017 episode, Perino read a prepared statement about O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s dismissal equivalent to what the network had released earlier in the day. The reasons for his firing and the sexual harassment allegations were not mentioned in the program itself. The termination of employment of the former host was a major feature of news coverage on both MSNBC and CNN; outside of the prepared statements, it was not mentioned on-air during the program and other regular topics were covered. The following day, images of the host were removed from the front windows of the News Corp. Building. O&#x27;Reilly was not given an opportunity to sign-off on-air, instead releasing a statement through his agency about the matter, while continuing to deny the sexual harassment allegations against him. During the final episode Gutfeld spoke about the program&#x27;s legacy and the loyalty of the show&#x27;s staff after a segment with Tucker Carlson, followed by a fading of the stage&#x27;s lighting to a dark state, revealing the set now blank of anything identifying the show.

The three-day interregnum allowed the network to sort out a new prime-time lineup to start on April 24, 2017, which saw &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; move into the former &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; time-slot, followed by the move of the late afternoon program &quot;The Five&quot; to 9:00 p.m. ET.

<text>An electrolytic capacitor is a polarized capacitor whose anode or positive plate is made of a metal that forms an insulating oxide layer through anodization. This oxide layer acts as the dielectric of the capacitor. A solid, liquid, or gel electrolyte covers the surface of this oxide layer, serving as the cathode or negative plate of the capacitor. Because of their very thin dielectric oxide layer and enlarged anode surface, electrolytic capacitors have a much higher capacitance-voltage (CV) product per unit volume than ceramic capacitors or film capacitors, and so can have large capacitance values. There are three families of electrolytic capacitor: aluminium electrolytic capacitors, tantalum electrolytic capacitors, and niobium electrolytic capacitors.

The large capacitance of electrolytic capacitors makes them particularly suitable for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals, and for storing large amounts of energy. They are widely used for decoupling or noise filtering in power supplies and DC link circuits for variable-frequency drives, for coupling signals between amplifier stages, and storing energy as in a flashlamp.

Electrolytic capacitors are polarized components because of their asymmetrical construction and must be operated with a higher potential (i.e., more positive) on the anode than on the cathode at all times. For this reason the polarity is marked on the device housing. Applying a reverse polarity voltage, or a voltage exceeding the maximum rated working voltage of as little as 1 or 1.5 volts, can damage the dielectric causing catastrophic failure of the capacitor itself. Failure of electrolytic capacitors can result in an explosion or fire, potentially causing damage to other components as well as injuries. Bipolar electrolytic capacitors which may be operated with either polarity are also made, using special constructions with two anodes connected in series. A bipolar electrolytic capacitor can be made by connecting two normal electrolytic capacitors in series, anode to anode or cathode to cathode, along with diodes.

==General information==

===Electrolytic capacitors family tree===
As to the basic construction principles of electrolytic capacitors, there are three different types: aluminium, tantalum, and niobium capacitors. Each of these three capacitor families uses non-solid and solid manganese dioxide or solid polymer electrolytes, so a great spread of different combinations of anode material and solid or non-solid electrolytes is available.

===Charge principle===
Like other conventional capacitors, electrolytic capacitors store the electric energy statically by charge separation in an electric field in the dielectric oxide layer between two electrodes. The non-solid or solid electrolyte in principle is the cathode, which thus forms the second electrode of the capacitor. This and the storage principle distinguish them from electrochemical capacitors or supercapacitors, in which the electrolyte generally is the ionic conductive connection between two electrodes and the storage occurs with statically double-layer capacitance and electrochemical pseudocapacitance.

===Basic materials and construction===
Electrolytic capacitors use a chemical feature of some special metals, previously called &quot;valve metals&quot;, which on contact with a particular electrolyte form a very thin insulating oxide layer on their surface by anodic oxidation which can function as a dielectric. There are three different anode metals in use for electrolytic capacitors:
# Aluminum electrolytic capacitors use a high-purity etched aluminium foil with aluminium oxide as dielectric
# Tantalum electrolytic capacitors use a sintered pellet (“slug”) of high-purity tantalum powder with tantalum pentoxide as dielectric
# Niobium electrolytic capacitors use a sintered &quot;slug&quot; of high-purity niobium or niobium oxide powder with niobium pentoxide as dielectric.

To increase their capacitance per unit volume, all anode materials are either etched or sintered and have a rough surface structure with a much higher surface area compared to a smooth surface of the same area or the same volume. By applying a positive voltage to the above-mentioned anode material in an electrolytic bath an oxide barrier layer with a thickness corresponding to the applied voltage will be formed (formation). This oxide layer acts as the dielectric in an electrolytic capacitor. The properties of these oxide layers are given in the following table:

After forming a dielectric oxide on the rough anode structure, a counter electrode has to match the rough insulating oxide surface. This is accomplished by the electrolyte, which acts as the cathode electrode of an electrolytic capacitor. There are many different electrolytes in use. Generally they are distinguished into two species, “non-solid” and “solid” electrolytes. As a liquid medium which has ion conductivity caused by moving ions, non-solid electrolytes can easily fit the rough structures. Solid electrolytes which have electron conductivity can fit the rough structures with the help of special chemical processes like pyrolysis for manganese dioxide or polymerization for conducting polymers.

Comparing the permittivities of the different oxide materials it is seen that tantalum pentoxide has a permittivity approximately three times higher than aluminium oxide. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors of a given CV value theoretically are therefore smaller than aluminium electrolytic capacitors. In practice different safety margins to reach reliable components makes a comparison difficult.

The anodically generated insulating oxide layer is destroyed if the polarity of the applied voltage changes.

===Capacitance and volumetric efficiency===

Electrolytic capacitors are based on the principle of a &quot;plate capacitor&quot; whose capacitance increases with larger electrode area A, higher dielectric permittivity ε, and thinness of dielectric (d).

:formula_1

The dielectric thickness of electrolytic capacitors is very small, in the range of nanometers per volt. On the other hand, the voltage strengths of these oxide layers are quite high. With this very thin dielectric oxide layer combined with a sufficiently high dielectric strength the electrolytic capacitors can achieve a high volumetric capacitance. This is one reason for the high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared to conventional capacitors.

All etched or sintered anodes have a much higher surface area compared to a smooth surface of the same area or the same volume. That increases the capacitance value, depending on the rated voltage, by a factor of up to 200 for non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors as well as for solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors. The large surface compared to a smooth one is the second reason for the relatively high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared with other capacitor families.

Because the forming voltage defines the oxide layer thickness, the desired voltage rating can be produced very simply. Electrolytic capacitors have high volumetric efficiency, the so-called &quot;CV product&quot;, defined as the product of capacitance and voltage divided by volume.

==Types and features of electrolytic capacitors==
===Comparison of electrolytic capacitor types===
Combinations of anode materials for electrolytic capacitors and the electrolytes used have given rise to wide varieties of capacitor types with different properties. An outline of the main characteristics of the different types is shown in the table below.

The non-solid or so-called &quot;wet&quot; aluminium electrolytic capacitors were and are the cheapest among all other conventional capacitors. They not only provide the cheapest solutions for high capacitance or voltage values for decoupling and buffering purposes but are also insensitive to low ohmic charging and discharging as well as to low-energy transients. Non-solid electrolytic capacitors can be found in nearly all areas of electronic devices, with the exception of military applications.

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte as surface-mountable chip capacitors are mainly used in electronic devices in which little space is available or a low profile is required. They operate reliably over a wide temperature range without large parameter deviations. In military and space applications only tantalum electrolytic capacitors have the necessary approvals.

Niobium electrolytic capacitors are in direct competition with industrial tantalum electrolytic capacitors because niobium is more readily available. Their properties are comparable.

The electrical properties of aluminium, tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors have been greatly improved by the polymer electrolyte.

===Comparison of electrical parameters===
In order to compare the different characteristics of the different electrolytic capacitor types, capacitors with the same dimensions and of similar capacitance and voltage are compared in the following table. In such a comparison the values for ESR and ripple current load are the most important parameters for the use of electrolytic capacitors in modern electronic equipment. The lower the ESR, the higher the ripple current per volume and better functionality of the capacitor in the circuit. However, better electrical parameters come with higher prices.

===Styles of aluminium and tantalum electrolytic capacitors===
Aluminium electrolytic capacitors form the bulk of the electrolytic capacitors used in electronics because of the large diversity of sizes and the inexpensive production. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors, usually used in the SMD (surface-mount device) version, have a higher specific capacitance than the aluminium electrolytic capacitors and are used in devices with limited space or flat design such as laptops. They are also used in military technology, mostly in axial style, hermetically sealed. Niobium electrolytic chip capacitors are a new development in the market and are intended as a replacement for tantalum electrolytic chip capacitors.

==History==

===Origin===
The phenomenon that in an electrochemical process, aluminium and such metals as tantalum, niobium, manganese, titanium, zinc, cadmium, etc., can form an oxide layer which blocks an electric current from flowing in one direction but which allows current to flow in the opposite direction, was first observed in 1857 by the German physicist and chemist Johann Heinrich Buff (1805–1878). It was first put to use in 1875 by the French researcher and founder Eugène Ducretet, who coined the term &quot;valve metal&quot; for such metals.

Charles Pollak (born Karol Pollak), a producer of accumulators, found out that the oxide layer on an aluminium anode remained stable in a neutral or alkaline electrolyte, even when the power was switched off. In 1896, he filed a patent for an &quot;Electric liquid capacitor with aluminium electrodes&quot; (de: &quot;Elektrischer Flüssigkeitskondensator mit Aluminiumelektroden&quot;) based on his idea of using the oxide layer in a polarized capacitor in combination with a neutral or slightly alkaline electrolyte.

===&quot;Wet&quot; aluminium capacitor===

The first industrially realized electrolytic capacitors consisted of a metallic box used as the cathode. It was filled with a borax electrolyte dissolved in water, in which a folded aluminium anode plate was inserted. Applying a DC voltage from outside, an oxide layer was formed on the surface of the anode. The advantage of these capacitors was that they were significantly smaller and cheaper than all other capacitors at this time relative to the realized capacitance value. This construction with different styles of anode construction but with a case as cathode and container for the electrolyte was used up to the 1930s and was called a &quot;wet&quot; electrolytic capacitor, in the sense of its having a high water content.

The first more common application of wet aluminium electrolytic capacitors was in large telephone exchanges, to reduce relay hash (noise) on the 48 volt DC power supply. The development of AC-operated domestic radio receivers in the late 1920s created a demand for large-capacitance (for the time) and high-voltage capacitors for the valve amplifier technique, typically at least 4 microfarads and rated at around 500 volts DC. Waxed paper and oiled silk film capacitors were available, but devices with that order of capacitance and voltage rating were bulky and prohibitively expensive.

===&quot;Dry&quot; aluminium capacitor===

The ancestor of the modern electrolytic capacitor was patented by Samuel Ruben in 1925, who teamed with Philip Mallory, the founder of the battery company that is now known as Duracell International. Ruben&#x27;s idea adopted the stacked construction of a silver mica capacitor. He introduced a separated second foil to contact the electrolyte adjacent to the anode foil instead of using the electrolyte-filled container as the capacitor&#x27;s cathode. The stacked second foil got its own terminal additional to the anode terminal and the container no longer had an electrical function. This type of electrolytic capacitor combined with a liquid or gel-like electrolyte of a non-aqueous nature, which is therefore dry in the sense of having a very low water content, became known as the &quot;dry&quot; type of electrolytic capacitor.

With Ruben&#x27;s invention, together with the invention of wound foils separated with a paper spacer 1927 by A. Eckel of Hydra-Werke (Germany), the actual development of electrolytic capacitors began.

William Dubilier, whose first patent for electrolytic capacitors was filed in 1928, industrialized the new ideas for electrolytic capacitors and started the first large commercial production in 1931 in the Cornell-Dubilier (CD) factory in Plainfield, New Jersey. At the same time in Berlin, Germany, the &quot;Hydra-Werke&quot;, an AEG company, started the production of electrolytic capacitors in large quantities. Another manufacturer, Ralph D. Mershon, had success in servicing the radio-market demand for electrolytic capacitors.
In his 1896 patent Pollak already recognized that the capacitance of the capacitor increases when roughening the surface of the anode foil. Today (2014), electrochemically etched low voltage foils can achieve an up to 200-fold increase in surface area compared to a smooth surface. Advances in the etching process are the reason for the dimension reductions in aluminium electrolytic capacitors over recent decades.

For aluminium electrolytic capacitors the decades from 1970 to 1990 were marked by the development of various new professional series specifically suited to certain industrial applications, for example with very low leakage currents or with long life characteristics, or for higher temperatures up to 125 °C.

===Tantalum capacitors===

One of the first tantalum electrolytic capacitors were developed in 1930 by Tansitor Electronic Inc. USA, for military purposes. The basic construction of a wound cell was adopted and a tantalum anode foil was used together with a tantalum cathode foil, separated with a paper spacer impregnated with a liquid electrolyte, mostly sulfuric acid, and encapsulated in a silver case.

The relevant development of solid electrolyte tantalum capacitors began some years after William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain invented the transistor in 1947. It was invented by Bell Laboratories in the early 1950s as a miniaturized, more reliable low-voltage support capacitor to complement their newly invented transistor. The solution found by R. L. Taylor and H. E. Haring at Bell Labs in early 1950 was based on experience with ceramics. They ground tantalum to a powder, which they pressed into a cylindrical form and then sintered at a high temperature between 1500 and 2000 °C under vacuum conditions, to produce a pellet (&quot;slug&quot;).

These first sintered tantalum capacitors used a non-solid electrolyte, which does not fit the concept of solid electronics. In 1952 a targeted search at Bell Labs by D. A. McLean and F. S. Power for a solid electrolyte led to the invention of manganese dioxide as a solid electrolyte for a sintered tantalum capacitor.

Although fundamental inventions came from Bell Labs, the inventions for manufacturing commercially viable tantalum electrolytic capacitors came from researchers at the Sprague Electric Company. Preston Robinson, Sprague&#x27;s Director of Research, is considered to be the actual inventor of tantalum capacitors in 1954. His invention was supported by R. J. Millard, who introduced the &quot;reform&quot; step in 1955, a significant improvement in which the dielectric of the capacitor was repaired after each dip-and-convert cycle of MnO2 deposition, which dramatically reduced the leakage current of the finished capacitors.

Although solid tantalum capacitors offered capacitors with lower ESR and leakage current values than the aluminium electrolytic capacitors, a 1980 price shock for tantalum dramatically reduced the applications of tantalum electrolytic capacitors, especially in the entertainment industry. The industry switched back to using aluminium electrolytic capacitors.

===Solid electrolytes===

The first solid electrolyte of manganese dioxide developed 1952 for tantalum capacitors had a conductivity 10 times better than all other types of non-solid electrolytes. It also influenced the development of aluminium electrolytic capacitors. In 1964 the first aluminium electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte SAL electrolytic capacitor came on the market, developed by Philips.

With the beginning of digitalization, Intel launched its first microcomputer, the MCS 4, in 1971. In 1972 Hewlett Packard launched one of the first pocket calculators, the HP 35. The requirements for capacitors increased in terms of lowering the equivalent series resistance (ESR) for bypass and decoupling capacitors.

It was not until 1983 when a new step toward ESR reduction was taken by Sanyo with its &quot;OS-CON&quot; aluminium electrolytic capacitors. These capacitors used a solid organic conductor, the charge transfer salt TTF-TCNQ (tetracyanoquinodimethane), which provided an improvement in conductivity by a factor of 10 compared with the manganese dioxide electrolyte.
The next step in ESR reduction was the development of conducting polymers by Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa in 1975. The conductivity of conductive polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) or PEDOT is better than that of TCNQ by a factor of 100 to 500, and close to the conductivity of metals.

In 1991 Panasonic released its &quot;SP-Cap&quot;, series of polymer aluminium electrolytic capacitors. These aluminium electrolytic capacitors with polymer electrolytes reached very low ESR values directly comparable to ceramic multilayer capacitors (MLCCs). They were still less expensive than tantalum capacitors and with their flat design for laptops and cell phones competed with tantalum chip capacitors as well.

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with PPy polymer electrolyte cathode followed three years later. In 1993 NEC introduced its SMD polymer tantalum electrolytic capacitors, called &quot;NeoCap&quot;. In 1997 Sanyo followed with the &quot;POSCAP&quot; polymer tantalum chips.

A new conductive polymer for tantalum polymer capacitors was presented by Kemet at the &quot;1999 Carts&quot; conference. This capacitor used the newly developed organic conductive polymer PEDT Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), also known as PEDOT (trade name Baytron®) 

===Niobium capacitors===

Another price explosion for tantalum in 2000/2001 forced the development of niobium electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte, which have been available since 2002. Niobium is a sister metal to tantalum and serves as valve metal generating an oxide layer during anodic oxidation. Niobium as raw material is much more abundant in nature than tantalum and is less expensive. It was a question of the availability of the base metal in the late 1960s which led to development and implementation of niobium electrolytic capacitors in the former Soviet Union instead of tantalum capacitors as in the West. The materials and processes used to produce niobium-dielectric capacitors are essentially the same as for existing tantalum-dielectric capacitors. The characteristics of niobium electrolytic capacitors and tantalum electrolytic capacitors are roughly comparable.

===Water-based electrolytes===
With the goal of reducing ESR for inexpensive non-solid electrolytic capacitors from the mid-1980s in Japan, new water-based electrolytes for aluminium electrolytic capacitors were developed. Water is inexpensive, an effective solvent for electrolytes, and significantly improves the conductivity of the electrolyte. The Japanese manufacturer Rubycon was a leader in the development of new water-based electrolyte systems with enhanced conductivity in the late 1990s. The new series of non-solid electrolytic capacitors with water-based electrolyte was described in the data sheets as having &quot;low ESR&quot;, &quot;low impedance&quot;, &quot;ultra-low impedance&quot; or &quot;high ripple current&quot;.

From 1999 through at least 2010, a stolen recipe for such a water-based electrolyte, in which important stabilizers were absent, led to the widespread problem of &quot;bad caps&quot; (failing electrolytic capacitors), leaking or occasionally bursting in computers, power supplies, and other electronic equipment, which became known as the &quot;capacitor plague&quot;. In these electrolytic capacitors the water reacts quite aggressively with aluminium, accompanied by strong heat and gas development in the capacitor, resulting in premature equipment failure, and development of a cottage repair industry.

==Electrical characteristics==
=== Series-equivalent circuit ===
The electrical characteristics of capacitors are harmonized by the international generic specification IEC 60384-1. In this standard, the electrical characteristics of capacitors are described by an idealized series-equivalent circuit with electrical components which model all ohmic losses, capacitive and inductive parameters of an electrolytic capacitor:
* &quot;C&quot;, the capacitance of the capacitor
* &quot;R&quot;ESR, the equivalent series resistance which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as &quot;ESR&quot;
* &quot;L&quot;ESL, the equivalent series inductance which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as &quot;ESL&quot;.
* &quot;R&quot;leak, the resistance representing the leakage current of the capacitor

===Capacitance, standard values and tolerances===

The electrical characteristics of electrolytic capacitors depend on the structure of the anode and the electrolyte used. This influences the capacitance value of electrolytic capacitors, which depends on measuring frequency and temperature. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes show a broader aberration over frequency and temperature ranges than do capacitors with solid electrolytes.

The basic unit of an electrolytic capacitor&#x27;s capacitance is the microfarad (μF). The capacitance value specified in the data sheets of the manufacturers is called the rated capacitance CR or nominal capacitance CN and is the value for which the capacitor has been designed.

The standardized measuring condition for electrolytic capacitors is an AC measuring method with 0.5 V at a frequency of 100/120 Hz at a temperature of 20 °C. For tantalum capacitors a DC bias voltage of 1.1 to 1.5  V for types with a rated voltage ≤2.5 V, or 2.1 to 2.5 V for types with a rated voltage of &gt;2.5 V, may be applied during the measurement to avoid reverse voltage.

The capacitance value measured at the frequency of 1 kHz is about 10% less than the 100/120 Hz value. Therefore, the capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors are not directly comparable and differ from those of film capacitors or ceramic capacitors, whose capacitance is measured at 1 kHz or higher.

Measured with an AC measuring method at 100/120 Hz the capacitance value is the closest value to the electrical charge stored in the e-caps. The stored charge is measured with a special discharge method and is called the DC capacitance. The DC capacitance is about 10% higher than the 100/120 Hz AC capacitance. The DC capacitance is of interest for discharge applications like photoflash.

The percentage of allowed deviation of the measured capacitance from the rated value is called the capacitance tolerance. Electrolytic capacitors are available in different tolerance series, whose values are specified in the E series specified in IEC 60063. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a letter code for each tolerance is specified in IEC 60062.
* rated capacitance, series E3, tolerance ±20%, letter code &quot;M&quot;
* rated capacitance, series E6, tolerance ±20%, letter code &quot;M&quot;
* rated capacitance, series E12, tolerance ±10%, letter code &quot;K&quot;

The required capacitance tolerance is determined by the particular application. Electrolytic capacitors, which are often used for filtering and bypassing, do not have the need for narrow tolerances because they are mostly not used for accurate frequency applications like in oscillators.

===Rated and category voltage===
Referring to the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard, the allowed operating voltage for electrolytic capacitors is called the &quot;rated voltage UR&quot; or &quot;nominal voltage UN&quot;. The rated voltage UR is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously at any temperature within the rated temperature range TR.

The voltage proof of electrolytic capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. For some applications it is important to use a higher temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types therefore the IEC standard specifies a &quot;temperature derated voltage&quot; for a higher temperature, the &quot;category voltage UC&quot;. The category voltage is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature within the category temperature range TC. The relation between both voltages and temperatures is given in the picture at right.

Applying a higher voltage than specified may destroy electrolytic capacitors.

Applying a lower voltage may have a positive influence on electrolytic capacitors. For aluminium electrolytic capacitors a lower applied voltage can in some cases extend the lifetime. For tantalum electrolytic capacitors lowering the voltage applied increases the reliability and reduces the expected failure rate.
I

===Surge voltage ===
The surge voltage indicates the maximum peak voltage value that may be applied to electrolytic capacitors during their application for a limited number of cycles.
The surge voltage is standardized in IEC/EN 60384-1. For aluminium electrolytic capacitors with a rated voltage of up to 315 V, the surge voltage is 1.15 times the rated voltage, and for capacitors with a rated voltage exceeding 315 V, the surge voltage is 1.10 times the rated voltage.

For tantalum electrolytic capacitors the surge voltage can be 1.3 times the rated voltage, rounded off to the nearest volt. The surge voltage applied to tantalum capacitors may influence the capacitor&#x27;s failure rate.

===Transient voltage===
aluminium electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are relatively insensitive to high and short-term transient voltages higher than surge voltage, if the frequency and the energy content of the transients are low. This ability depends on rated voltage and component size. Low energy transient voltages lead to a voltage limitation similar to a zener diode. An unambiguous and general specification of tolerable transients or peak voltages is not possible. In every case transients arise, the application has to be approved very carefully.

Electrolytic capacitors with solid manganese oxide or polymer electrolyte, and aluminium as well as tantalum electrolytic capacitors cannot withstand transients or peak voltages higher than the surge voltage. Transients may destroy this type of electrolytic capacitor.

===Reverse voltage===
Standard electrolytic capacitors, and aluminium as well as tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors are polarized and generally require the anode electrode voltage to be positive relative to the cathode voltage.

Nevertheless, electrolytic capacitors can withstand for short instants a reverse voltage for a limited number of cycles. Specifically, aluminium electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte can withstand a reverse voltage of about 1 V to 1.5 V. This reverse voltage should never be used to determine the maximum reverse voltage under which a capacitor can be used permanently.

Solid tantalum capacitors can also withstand reverse voltages for short periods. The most common guidelines for tantalum reverse voltage are:
*10 % of rated voltage to a maximum of 1 V at 25 °C,
*3 % of rated voltage to a maximum of 0.5 V at 85 °C,
*1 % of rated voltage to a maximum of 0.1 V at 125 °C.
These guidelines apply for short excursion and should never be used to determine the maximum reverse voltage under which a capacitor can be used permanently.

But in no case, for aluminium as well as for tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors, may a reverse voltage be used for a permanent AC application.

To minimize the likelihood of a polarized electrolytic being incorrectly inserted into a circuit, polarity has to be very clearly indicated on the case, see the section on polarity marking below.

Special bipolar aluminium electrolytic capacitors designed for bipolar operation are available, and usually referred to as &quot;non-polarized&quot; or &quot;bipolar&quot; types. In these, the capacitors have two anode foils with full-thickness oxide layers connected in reverse polarity. On the alternate halves of the AC cycles, one of the oxides on the foil acts as a blocking dielectric, preventing reverse current from damaging the electrolyte of the other one. But these bipolar electrolytic capacitors are not suitable for main AC applications instead of power capacitors with metallized polymer film or paper dielectric.

===Impedance===
In general, a capacitor is seen as a storage component for electric energy. But this is only one capacitor application. A capacitor can also act as an AC resistor. aluminium electrolytic capacitors in particular are often used as decoupling capacitors to filter or bypass undesired AC frequencies to ground or for capacitive coupling of audio AC signals. Then the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications, the impedance (AC resistance) is as important as the capacitance value.

The impedance &quot;Z&quot; is the vector sum of reactance and resistance; it describes the phase difference and the ratio of amplitudes between sinusoidally varying voltage and sinusoidally varying current at a given frequency. In this sense impedance is a measure of the ability of the capacitor to pass alternating currents and can be used like Ohm&#x27;s law.
: formula_2

In other words, impedance is a frequency-dependent AC resistance and possesses both magnitude and phase at a particular frequency.

In data sheets of electrolytic capacitors only the impedance magnitude &quot;|Z|&quot; is specified, and simply written as &quot;&quot;Z&quot;.&quot; Regarding the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard, the impedance values of electrolytic capacitors are measured and specified at 10 kHz or 100 kHz depending on the capacitance and voltage of the capacitor.

Besides measuring, the impedance can be calculated using the idealized components of a capacitor&#x27;s series-equivalent circuit, including an ideal capacitor &quot;C&quot;, a resistor &quot;ESR&quot;, and an inductance &quot;ESL&quot;. In this case the impedance at the angular frequency &quot;ω&quot; is given by the geometric (complex) addition of &quot;ESR&quot;, by a capacitive reactance &quot;XC&quot;

: formula_3

and by an inductive reactance &quot;XL&quot; (Inductance)

formula_4.

Then &quot;Z&quot; is given by

: formula_5.

In the special case of resonance, in which the both reactive resistances &quot;XC&quot; and &quot;XL&quot; have the same value (&quot;XC=XL&quot;), then the impedance will only be determined by &quot;ESR&quot;. With frequencies above the resonance frequency, the impedance increases again because of the &quot;ESL&quot; of the capacitor. The capacitor becomes an inductor.

===ESR and dissipation factor tan δ===
The equivalent series resistance (&quot;ESR&quot;) summarizes all resistive losses of the capacitor. These are the terminal resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes, the electrolyte resistance, and the dielectric losses in the dielectric oxide layer.

For electrolytic capacitors, &quot;ESR&quot; generally decreases with increasing frequency and temperature.

&quot;ESR&quot; influences the superimposed AC ripple after smoothing and may influence the circuit functionality. Within the capacitor, &quot;ESR&quot; accounts for internal heat generation if a ripple current flows across the capacitor. This internal heat reduces the lifetime of non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors and affects the reliability of solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors.

For electrolytic capacitors, for historical reasons the dissipation factor &quot;tan δ&quot; will sometimes be specified in the data sheet instead of the &quot;ESR&quot;. The dissipation factor is determined by the tangent of the phase angle between the capacitive reactance &quot;XC&quot; minus the inductive reactance &quot;XL&quot; and the &quot;ESR&quot;. If the inductance &quot;ESL&quot; is small, the dissipation factor can be approximated as:

: formula_6

The dissipation factor is used for capacitors with very low losses in frequency-determining circuits where the reciprocal value of the dissipation factor is called the quality factor (Q), which represents a resonator&#x27;s bandwidth.

===Ripple current===
&quot;Ripple current&quot; is the RMS value of a superimposed AC current of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation within the specified temperature range. It arises mainly in power supplies (including switched-mode power supplies) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as charge and discharge current through any decoupling and smoothing capacitors.

Ripple currents generate heat inside the capacitor body. This dissipation power loss &quot;PL&quot; is caused by &quot;ESR&quot; and is the squared value of the effective (RMS) ripple current &quot;IR&quot;.

: formula_7

This internally generated heat, additional to the ambient temperature and possibly other external heat sources, leads to a capacitor body temperature having a temperature difference of &quot;Δ T&quot; relative to ambient. This heat has to be distributed as thermal losses &quot;Pth&quot; over the capacitor&#x27;s surface &quot;A&quot; and the thermal resistance &quot;β&quot; to ambient.

: formula_8

The internally generated heat has to be distributed to ambient by thermal radiation, convection, and thermal conduction. The temperature of the capacitor, which is the net difference between heat produced and heat dissipated, must not exceed the capacitor&#x27;s maximum specified temperature.

The ripple current is specified as an effective (RMS) value at 100 or 120 Hz or at 10 kHz at upper category temperature. Non-sinusoidal ripple currents have to be analyzed and separated into their single sinusoidal frequencies by means of Fourier analysis and summarized by squared addition the single currents.

: formula_9

In non-solid electrolytic capacitors the heat generated by the ripple current causes the evaporation of electrolytes, shortening the lifetime of the capacitors. Exceeding the limit tends to result in explosive failure.

In solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte the heat generated by the ripple current affects the reliability of the capacitors. Exceeding the limit tends to result in catastrophic failure, failing short-circuit, with visible burning.

The heat generated by the ripple current also affects the lifetime of aluminium and tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid polymer electrolytes. Exceeding the limit tends to result in catastrophic failure, failing short-circuit.

===Current surge, peak or pulse current===
aluminium electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes normally can be charged up to the rated voltage without any current surge, peak or pulse limitation. This property is a result of the limited ion movability in the liquid electrolyte, which slows down the voltage ramp across the dielectric, and of the capacitor&#x27;s ESR. Only the frequency of peaks integrated over time must not exceed the maximal specified ripple current.

Solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte or polymer electrolyte are damaged by peak or pulse currents. Solid Tantalum capacitors which are exposed to surge, peak or pulse currents, for example, in highly inductive circuits, should be used with a voltage derating. If possible, the voltage profile should be a ramp turn-on, as this reduces the peak current experienced by the capacitor.

===Leakage current===
For electrolytic capacitors, DC leakage current (DCL) is a special characteristic that other conventional capacitors do not have. This current is represented by the resistor Rleak in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of electrolytic capacitors.

The reasons for leakage current are different between electrolytic capacitors with non-solid and with solid electrolyte or more common for &quot;wet&quot; aluminium and for &quot;solid&quot; tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte as well as for electrolytic capacitors with polymer electrolytes. For non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors the leakage current includes all weakened imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted chemical processes taking place during the time without applied voltage (storage time) between operating cycles. These unwanted chemical processes depend on the kind of electrolyte. Water-based electrolytes are more aggressive to the aluminium oxide layer than are electrolytes based on organic liquids. This is why different electrolytic capacitor series specify different storage time without reforming.

Applying a positive voltage to a &quot;wet&quot; capacitor causes a reforming (self-healing) process which repairs all weakened dielectric layers, and the leakage current remain at a low level.

Although the leakage current of non-solid electrolytic capacitors is higher than current flow across the dielectric in ceramic or film capacitors, self-discharge of modern non-solid electrolytic capacitors with organic electrolytes takes several weeks.

The main causes of DCL for solid tantalum capacitors include electrical breakdown of the dielectric; conductive paths due to impurities or poor anodization; and bypassing of dielectric due to excess manganese dioxide, to moisture paths, or to cathode conductors (carbon, silver). This &quot;normal&quot; leakage current in solid electrolyte capacitors cannot be reduced by &quot;healing&quot;, because under normal conditions solid electrolytes cannot provide oxygen for forming processes. This statement should not be confused with the self-healing process during field crystallization, see below, Reliability (Failure rate).

The specification of the leakage current in data sheets is often given as multiplication of the rated capacitance value &quot;CR&quot; with the value of the rated voltage &quot;UR&quot; together with an addendum figure, measured after a measuring time of two or five minutes, for example:

:formula_10

The leakage current value depends on the voltage applied, on the temperature of the capacitor, and on measuring time. Leakage current in solid MnO2 tantalum electrolytic capacitors generally drops very much faster than for non-solid electrolytic capacitors but remain at the level reached.

===Dielectric absorption (soakage)===
{{main|Dielectric absorption}}

Dielectric absorption occurs when a capacitor that has remained charged for a long time discharges only incompletely when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would reach zero volts after discharge, real capacitors develop a small voltage from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called dielectric relaxation, &quot;soakage&quot; or &quot;battery action&quot;.

Dielectric absorption may be a problem in circuits where very small currents are used in the function of an electronic circuit, such as long-time-constant integrators or sample-and-hold circuits. In most electrolytic capacitor applications supporting power supply lines, dielectric absorption is not a problem.

But especially for electrolytic capacitors with high rated voltage, the voltage at the terminals generated by the dielectric absorption can pose a safety risk to personnel or circuits. In order to prevent shocks, most very large capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that need to be removed before the capacitors are used.

==Operational characteristics==

===Reliability (failure rate)===
The reliability of a component is a property that indicates how reliably this component performs its function in a time interval. It is subject to a stochastic process and can be described qualitatively and quantitatively; it is not directly measurable. The reliability of electrolytic capacitors is empirically determined by identifying the failure rate in production accompanying endurance tests, see Reliability engineering.

Reliability normally is shown as a bathtub curve and is divided into three areas: early failures or infant mortality failures, constant random failures and wear out failures. Failures totalized in a failure rate are short circuit, open circuit, and degradation failures (exceeding electrical parameters).

The reliability prediction is generally expressed in a failure rate λ, abbreviated FIT (Failures In Time). This is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (109) component-hours of operation (e.g., 1000 components for 1 million hours, or 1  million components for 1000 hours which is 1 ppm/1000 hours) at fixed working conditions during the period of constant random failures. This failure rate model implicitly assumes the idea of &quot;random failure&quot;. Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate.

Billions of tested capacitor unit-hours would be needed to establish failure rates in the very low level range which are required today to ensure the production of large quantities of components without failures. This requires about a million units over a long time period, which means a large staff and considerable financing. The tested failure rates are often complemented with figures resulting from feedback from the field from major customers (field failure rate), which mostly results in a lower failure rate than tested.

The reciprocal value of FIT is Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).

The standard operating conditions for FIT testing are 40 °C and 0.5 UR. For other conditions of applied voltage, current load, temperature, capacitance value, circuit resistance (for tantalum capacitors), mechanical influences and humidity, the FIT figure can be converted with acceleration factors standardized for industrial or military applications. The higher the temperature and applied voltage, the higher the failure rate, for example.

The most often cited source for failure rate conversion is MIL-HDBK-217F, the “bible” of failure rate calculations for electronic components. SQC Online, the online statistical calculator for acceptance sampling and quality control, provides an online tool for short examination to calculate given failure rate values for given application conditions.

Some manufacturers may have their own FIT calculation tables for tantalum capacitors. or for aluminium capacitors

For tantalum capacitors the failure rate is often specified at 85 °C and rated voltage UR as reference conditions and expressed as percent failed components per thousand hours (n %/1000 h). That is, “n” number of failed components per 105 hours, or in FIT the ten-thousand-fold value per 109 hours.

Tantalum capacitors are now very reliable components. Continuous improvement in tantalum powder and capacitor technologies have resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of impurities which formerly caused most field crystallization failures. Commercially available industrially produced tantalum capacitors now have reached as standard products the high MIL standard &quot;C&quot; level, which is 0.01%/1000 h at 85 °C and UR or 1 failure per 107 hours at 85 °C and UR. Converted to FIT with the acceleration factors coming from MIL HDKB 217F at 40 °C and 0.5 , UR is the failure rate. For a 100 μF/25 V tantalum chip capacitor used with a series resistance of 0.1 Ω the failure rate is 0.02 FIT.

Aluminium electrolytic capacitors do not use a specification in &quot;% per 1000 h at 85 °C and UR&quot;. They use the FIT specification with 40 °C and 0.5 UR as reference conditions. aluminium electrolytic capacitors are very reliable components. Published figures show for low voltage types (6.3…160 V) FIT rates in the range of 1 to 20 FIT and for high voltage types (&gt;160 …550 V) FIT rates in the range of 20 to 200 FIT. Field failure rates for aluminium e-caps are in the range of 0.5 to 20 FIT.

The published figures show that both tantalum and aluminium capacitor types are reliable components, comparable with other electronic components and achieving safe operation for decades under normal conditions. But a great difference exists in the case of wear-out failures. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, have a limited period of constant random failures up to the point when wear-out failures begin. The constant random failure rate period corresponds to the lifetime or service life of “wet” aluminium electrolytic capacitors.

===Lifetime===
The lifetime, service life, load life or useful life of electrolytic capacitors is a special characteristic of non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors, whose liquid electrolyte can evaporate over time. Lowering the electrolyte level affects the electrical parameters of the capacitors. The capacitance decreases and the impedance and ESR increase with decreasing amounts of electrolyte. This very slow electrolyte drying-out depends on the temperature, the applied ripple current load, and the applied voltage. The lower these parameters compared to their maximum values, the longer the capacitor&#x27;s “life”. The “end of life” point is defined by the appearance of wear-out failures or degradation failures when either capacitance, impedance, ESR or leakage current exceed their specified change limits.

The lifetime is a specification of a collection of tested capacitors and delivers an expectation of the behavior of similar types. This lifetime definition corresponds to the time of the constant random failure rate in the bathtub curve.

But even after exceeding the specified limits and the capacitors having reached their “end of life”, the electronic circuit is not in immediate danger; only the functionality of the capacitors is reduced. With today&#x27;s high levels of purity in the manufacture of electrolytic capacitors it is not to be expected that short circuits occur after the end-of-life-point with progressive evaporation combined with parameter degradation.

The lifetime of non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors is specified in terms of “hours per temperature&quot;, like &quot;2,000h/105 °C&quot;. With this specification the lifetime at operational conditions can be estimated by special formulas or graphs specified in the data sheets of serious manufacturers. They use different ways for specification, some give special formulas, others specify their e-caps lifetime calculation with graphs that consider the influence of applied voltage. The basic principle for calculating the time under operational conditions is the so-called “10-degree-rule”.

This rule is also known as the Arrhenius rule. It characterizes the change of thermic reaction speed. For every 10 °C lower temperature the evaporation is reduced by half. That means for every 10 °C reduction in temperature, the lifetime of capacitors doubles. If a lifetime specification of an electrolytic capacitor is, for example, 2000  h/105 °C, the capacitor&#x27;s lifetime at 45 °C can be ”calculated” as 128,000 hours—that is roughly 15 years—by using the 10-degrees-rule.

However, solid polymer electrolytic capacitors, and aluminium, tantalum, and niobium electrolytic capacitors also have a lifetime specification. The polymer electrolyte exhibits a small deterioration of conductivity caused by thermal degradation of the conductive polymer. The electrical conductivity decreases as a function of time, in agreement with a granular metal type structure, in which aging is due to the shrinking of the conductive polymer grains. The lifetime of polymer electrolytic capacitors is specified in terms similar to non-solid electrolytic capacitors but its lifetime calculation follows other rules, leading to much longer operational lifetimes.

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid manganese dioxide electrolyte do not have wear-out failures, so they do not have a lifetime specification in the sense of non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors. Also, tantalum capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, the &quot;wet tantalums&quot;, do not have a lifetime specification because they are hermetically sealed.

===Failure modes, self-healing mechanism and application rules===
The many different types of electrolytic capacitors exhibit different electrical long-term behavior, intrinsic failure modes, and self-healing mechanisms. Application rules for types with an intrinsic failure mode are specified to ensure capacitors with high reliability and long life.

=== Performance after storage ===
All electrolytic capacitors are &quot;aged&quot; during manufacturing by applying the rated voltage at high temperature for a sufficient time to repair all cracks and weaknesses that may have occurred during production. However, a particular problem with non-solid aluminium models may occur after storage or unpowered periods. Chemical processes (corrosion) can weaken the oxide layer, which may lead to a higher leakage current. Most modern electrolytic systems are chemically inert and do not exhibit corrosion problems, even after storage times of two years or longer. Non-solid electrolytic capacitors using organic solvents like GBL as electrolyte do not have problems with high leakage current after prolonged storage. They can be stored for up to 10 years without problems

Storage times can be tested using accelerated shelf-life testing, which requires storage without applied voltage at the upper category temperature for a certain period, usually 1000 hours. This shelf life test is a good indicator for chemical stability and of the oxide layer, because all chemical reactions are accelerated by higher temperatures. Nearly all commercial series of non-solid electrolytic capacitors fulfill the 1000 hour shelf life test. However, many series are specified only for two years of storage. This also ensures solderability of the terminals.

For antique radio equipment or for electrolytic capacitors built in the 1970s or earlier, &quot;preconditioning&quot; may be appropriate. This is performed by applying the rated voltage to the capacitor via a series resistor of approximately 1 kΩ for one hour, allowing the oxide layer to repair itself through self-healing. Capacitors that fail leakage current requirements after preconditioning may have experienced mechanical damage.

Electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolytes do not have preconditioning requirements.

==Causes of explosion==
Electrolytic capacitors can explode due to several reasons, primarily related to internal pressure buildup and electrolyte issues:
*Overvoltage and Reverse Polarity: Applying a voltage higher than the rated value or reversing the polarity can cause excessive current to flow, leading to rapid heating. This heating can decompose the electrolyte, generating gas and increasing internal pressure until the capacitor explodes.
*Electrolyte Decomposition: Electrolytes in capacitors can decompose into gasses such as hydrogen when exposed to high temperatures or electrical stresses. The resulting gas increases internal pressure, leading to the rupture of the capacitor casing.
*Design Flaws and Manufacturing Defects: Poor manufacturing processes can lead to weak points in the capacitor’s structure. During the capacitor plague, a widespread issue arose from the use of an incomplete electrolyte formula, which lacked necessary inhibitors to prevent gas formation and pressure buildup.
*Thermal Runaway: High ripple currents can cause the capacitor to overheat. As the temperature rises, the electrolyte evaporates faster, creating more gas and increasing pressure, which can result in an explosion.
*Aging and Deterioration: Over time, the materials within electrolytic capacitors degrade, reducing their ability to handle electrical stress and heat. This aging process can lead to internal failures and explosions.

===Capacitor symbols===
Electrolytic capacitor symbols
===Parallel connection===
If an individual capacitor within a bank of parallel capacitors develops a short, the entire energy of the capacitor bank discharges through that short. Thus, large capacitors, particularly high voltage types, should be individually protected against sudden discharge.

===Series connection===
In applications where high withstanding voltages are needed, electrolytic capacitors can be connected in series. Because of individual variation in insulation resistance, and thus the leakage current when voltage is applied, the voltage is not distributed evenly across each series capacitor. This can result in the voltage rating of an individual capacitor being exceeded. A passive or active balancer circuit must be provided in order to equalize the voltage across each individual capacitor.

===Polarity marking===
Polarity marking for polymer electrolytic capacitors

===Imprinted markings===
Electrolytic capacitors, like most other electronic components, are marked, space permitting, with
* manufacturer&#x27;s name or trademark;
* manufacturer&#x27;s type designation;
* polarity of the terminations (for polarized capacitors)
* rated capacitance;
* tolerance on rated capacitance
* rated voltage and nature of supply (AC or DC)
* climatic category or rated temperature;
* year and month (or week) of manufacture;
* certification marks of safety standards (for safety EMI/RFI suppression capacitors)

Smaller capacitors use a shorthand notation. The most commonly used format is: XYZ J/K/M “V”, where XYZ represents the capacitance (calculated as XY × 10Z pF), the letters K or M indicate the tolerance (±10% and ±20% respectively) and “V” represents the working voltage.

Examples:

* 105K 330V implies a capacitance of 10 × 105 pF = 1 μF (K = ±10%) with a rated voltage of 330 V.
* 476M 100V implies a capacitance of 47 × 106 pF = 47 μF (M = ±20%) with a rated voltage of 100 V.

Capacitance, tolerance and date of manufacture can be indicated with a short code specified in IEC/EN 60062. Examples of short-marking of the rated capacitance (microfarads): μ47 = 0,47 μF, 4μ7 = 4,7 μF, 47μ = 47 μF

The date of manufacture is often printed according to international standards.

* Version 1: coding with year/week numeral code, &quot;1208&quot; is &quot;2012, week number 8&quot;.
* Version 2: coding with year code/month code. The year codes are: &quot;R&quot; = 2003, &quot;S&quot;= 2004, &quot;T&quot; = 2005, &quot;U&quot; = 2006, &quot;V&quot; = 2007, &quot;W&quot; = 2008, &quot;X&quot; = 2009, &quot;A&quot; = 2010, &quot;B&quot; = 2011, &quot;C&quot; = 2012, &quot;D&quot; = 2013, “E” = 2014 etc. Month codes are: &quot;1&quot; to &quot;9&quot; = Jan. to Sept., &quot;O&quot; = October, &quot;N&quot; = November, &quot;D&quot; = December. &quot;X5&quot; is then &quot;2009, May&quot;

For very small capacitors no marking is possible. Here only the traceability of the manufacturers can ensure the identification of a type.

===Standardization===
The standardization for all electrical, electronic components and related technologies follows the rules given by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), a non-profit, non-governmental international standards organization.

The definition of the characteristics and the procedure of the test methods for capacitors for use in electronic equipment are set out in the Generic specification:

* IEC/EN 60384-1 - Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment

The tests and requirements to be met by aluminium and tantalum electrolytic capacitors for use in electronic equipment for approval as standardized types are set out in the following sectional specifications:

* IEC/EN 60384-3—&quot;Surface mount fixed tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide solid electrolyte&quot;
* IEC/EN 60384-4—&quot;Aluminium electrolytic capacitors with solid (MnO2) and non-solid electrolyte&quot;
* IEC/EN 60384-15—&quot;Fixed tantalum capacitors with non-solid and solid electrolyte&quot;
* IEC/EN 60384-18—&quot;Fixed aluminium electrolytic surface mount capacitors with solid (MnO2) and non-solid electrolyte&quot;
* IEC/EN 60384-24—&quot;Surface mount fixed tantalum electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte&quot;
* IEC/EN 60384-25—&quot;Surface mount fixed aluminium electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte&quot;
* IEC/EN 60384-26—&quot;Fixed aluminium electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte&quot;

===Market===
The market for electrolytic capacitors in 2008 was roughly 30% of the total market in value
* aluminium electrolytic capacitors—US$3.9 billion (22%);
* Tantalum electrolytic capacitors—US$2.2 billion (12%);
In number of pieces, these capacitors cover about 10% of the total capacitor market, or about 100 to 120 billion pieces.

<text>Pay Day is a board game originally made by Parker Brothers (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) in 1974. It was invented by Paul J. Gruen of West Newbury, Massachusetts, United States, one of the era&#x27;s top board game designers, and his brother-in-law Charles C. Bailey. It was Gruen&#x27;s most successful game, outselling &quot;Monopoly&quot; in its first production year. Pay Day is currently marketed by Winning Moves Games USA.

The game simulates money management, with the game board resembling a calendar month. Before the game, the players decide how many months to be played (i.e. how many times to travel across the board). During the game, players accumulate bills and expenses to pay, along with collecting their monthly wage on &quot;pay day&quot; at the end of the month. The winner is the player who has the most money at the end of the last month of play.

==Rules (original 1974-era)==

===Object===
The object is to be the player who has the most cash and savings at the end of the game. Players decide in advance how many in-game months will be played.

===Equipment===
The game is played under the 1974-era rules with the game board, one die, four playing pieces, play money, 16 &quot;Deal&quot; cards, 72 &quot;Mail&quot; cards. Older versions also included a &quot;Savings and Loan Calculator&quot; and 12 &quot;savings and loans&quot; pegs. Later editions replaced the &quot;calculator&quot; and pegs with a &quot;Savings and Loan&quot; pad plus a table to calculate savings and loan interest.

===Play===
Each player starts with $325. One player is selected to go first. Players roll the die and advance their playing piece from 1 to 6 spaces as indicated on the die. The player follows the instructions shown on the calendar space on the game board. There are 31 days in a &quot;Pay Day&quot; month.

===Deal and mail cards===
If a player lands on either a &quot;Deal&quot; or &quot;Mail&quot; space, they will then select the appropriate card(s) from the top of the specified deck.

====Deal cards====
The player has the option of purchasing the &quot;Deal&quot; for the cost indicated &quot;immediately&quot; or returning the card to the bottom of the deck. (One may take out a loan to pay for the deal.) The &quot;Deal&quot; is held until that player lands on a &quot;Buyer&quot; space at any time during the duration of the game. A &quot;Deal&quot; card has no value if it remains unsold at the end of the game. Whenever a &quot;Deal&quot; is purchased, &quot;all&quot; players have an opportunity to win the &quot;Commission&quot; indicated on the &quot;Deal&quot; card. Each player in turn rolls the die, with the highest roller collecting the &quot;Commission&quot; from the bank.

====Mail cards====
Mail cards have varying content, just like real mail. Some mail cards are bills, some are fortuitous collections, and some are just entertaining (postcards and advertisements).

Bills are due at the end of the month (unless cancelled by Insurance, see below), while collections (except for Lottery Tickets) are payable immediately. Postcards and junk mail are immediately discarded.

Three types of mail cards are &quot;special&quot; mail cards which have unique rules:
;Lottery Ticket: If a player gets a lottery ticket in the mail, that player can cash in the value of the ticket only if that player lands on the Lottery Draw space &quot;during&quot; the month they receive it in the mail. After the end of the month, if it is not redeemed, it becomes void and must be returned to the bottom of the Mail pile.

;Swellfare: If a player&#x27;s loan, plus loan interest due, plus bills are greater than their total amount of cash, they are in debt. That player may bet up to $100, then if that player rolls a 5 or a 6, they collect 10 times the amount bet; otherwise, the amount bet goes into the pot. Swellfare cards not used are immediately discarded.

;Insurance: If a player receives a mailing for either auto insurance (&quot;Carr Insurance Co.&quot;) or health insurance (&quot;Aches &amp; Pains Insurance Co.&quot;), the player may purchase insurance at their option. If purchased, the insurance is good for the entire game and will automatically cancel any related bills (including those already held by the player). Insurance cards not used are immediately discarded.

===Daylight savings===
Each player in turn, starting with the player who landed there, moves their token back one space and follows the instructions as in a regular turn. If a player&#x27;s game piece is on the &quot;Start&quot; space when another player lands on &quot;Daylight Savings&quot;, they simply collect another $325 and leave the game piece on &quot;Start.&quot; The &quot;Daylight Savings&quot; process takes place only once on any turn and should not be repeated if a player lands there as a result of another player having landed there first.

===Town election ===
All players must contribute to the town election ($50 per person). If a player does not have the cash, they &quot;must&quot; withdraw from their savings, or take out or increase a loan. The next player to roll a 6 during the course of the game wins the Pot (including any &quot;Swellfare&quot; money that may already be in there).

===Poker game===
Each player has the option of placing $100 on the board. All poker game participants roll the die. The highest roller collects all of the money.

===Buyer===
If a player holding a Deal card lands on a Buyer space, they may return it to the bottom of the Deal deck and collect the indicated sale price from the bank. Only one Deal card may be redeemed per turn.

===Savings and loans===
A player may have either a savings account or a loan, but never both at the same time.

;Savings: Players may start or add to their savings only on &quot;Pay Day&quot;. Players may withdraw all or part of their savings only on &quot;Pay Day&quot; (if the player wishes to withdraw at another time, they must pay a $50 fee). A player receives 10% interest on the balance in his/her savings account every time he lands on &quot;Pay Day&quot;. For easy calculation of interest on savings or loans refer to the Interest Table.

;Loans: A loan may be taken out or increased at any time in $100 increments. A player must pay 20% interest on his/her outstanding loan balance every time they land on &quot;Pay Day&quot;. Loans may &quot;only&quot; be paid off on &quot;Pay Day&quot;.

;Calculating savings and loans: The original editions included a &quot;Savings and Loan Calculator&quot; peg board and 12 &quot;savings and loans&quot; pegs. When a player opened an account, a peg was then added in the appropriate S or L section of the player’s calculator to show the amount of money which was held or lent by the bank. This system was later replaced with a &quot;Savings and Loan&quot; pad to actually hand write the amounts in the savings and loan accounts, plus there was a printed table to help calculate savings and loan interest.

===Sweet Sunday===
As the name indicates, Sweet Sunday spaces have neither an award nor a penalty, just a space to &quot;rest&quot;.

===Pay Day===

A player who reaches this space immediately stops, regardless of any additional counts on the die, and goes through these steps in the indicated order.

# Collect monthly wages of $325, except on the last month of play.
# Collect 10% interest on any savings account, or pay 20% interest on any outstanding loan balance to the bank.
# Pay all bills received during the month and place them in the discarded mail stack. If a player does not have enough cash to pay the bills, they must either withdraw money from their savings account, or take out or increase a loan.
# OPTIONAL: Pay off part or all of an outstanding loan, withdraw money from a savings account without penalty, or deposit money into the account. These transactions may only be done in $100 increments.
# Discard any unused Lottery Tickets.
# Discard any Deal cards still held (last month of play only).
# Move the game piece back to the Start space, unless the player has just completed their last month of play.

===Winning===
The player who finishes the game with the most money (cash plus savings or cash minus loans) after all players clearing the set number of months before the play starts is the winner. If all players are &quot;in the negative&quot; (all have loans exceeding their cash), then whoever is the least &quot;in the negative&quot; wins.

==Changes to the 1994 edition==
Some of the changes/additions to the 1994 edition included:

* The maximum number of players was increased to six, as well as the number of players&#x27; tokens.
* The game now had 24 &quot;Deal&quot; cards and 48 &quot;Mail&quot; cards
* Savings accounts were removed from the game. Players can only open loans.
* Players began the game with $3,500 and received this amount at the end of each month. Loan increments were also increased from $100 to $1,000. The other dollar amounts were also multiplied by 10.
** However, the loan interest per month was decreased from 20 percent to 10 percent.
* The &quot;Pot&quot; was renamed to &quot;Jackpot&quot;.
* The lottery ticket mail card and the lottery draw was replaced with new lottery rules: Once a player lands on the Lottery space, a lottery begins. The Bank first antes up $1,000, then each player may optionally ante an additional $100 to the pot. Then starting with the player who landed on the space, each player who anted in turn picks a different number from 1 to 6. The player who landed on the Lottery space rolls the die, and the player whose number is rolled collects all the money.
* Additional special board spaces:
** Super Ski Sunday, Charity Concert, Food for the Month, and Shopping Spree: the player must put the amount shown into the Jackpot.
** Sweepstakes: the player who lands on this space receives $5000 from the bank.
** Radio phone-in contest: each player, starting with the one who lands on this space, rolls the die, and the first one to roll a 3 receives $1,000 from the bank.
** Happy Birthday: the player who lands on this space gets $100 each from every other player.
** Yard Sale: at the start of a game, a &quot;Deal&quot; card is placed face down under the edge of the board next to this space, indicating the deal being sold at the yard sale. The player who lands on this space then pays the bank $100 times the number rolled and takes the Deal card under the edge of the board. A new deal card is then placed face down to indicate the deal at the next yard sale.
** Walk For Charity: All players, except the player who landed on this space, roll the die and put $100 times the number rolled into the Jackpot.
* Special mail cards:
** Pay a Neighbor: the player chooses an opponent to pay the amount shown on the card. Even if predetermined month of the player is retired.
** Mad Money: the player chooses an opponent to collect from the amount shown on the card.
** Charity: the player must put the amount of money shown on the card into the Jackpot.

<doc id="343498" wikidata="Q326917" url="?curid=343498" title="Liaodong Peninsula">
<text>The Liaodong or Liaotung Peninsula () is a peninsula in southern Liaoning province in Northeast China, and makes up the southwestern coastal half of the Liaodong region. It is located between the mouths of the Daliao River (the historical lower section of the Liao River) in the west and the Yalu River in the east, and encompasses the territories of the whole sub-provincial city of Dalian and parts of prefectural cities of Yingkou, Anshan and Dandong.

The word &quot;Liaodong&quot; literally means &quot;Liao region&#x27;s east&quot;, referring initially to the Warring States period Yan commandery of Liaodong, which encompassed an area from modern Liaoning-Jilin border in the north to the Chongchon River on the Korean Peninsula in the south, and from just east of the Qian Mountains to a now-disappeared large wetland between the western banks of middle Liao River and the base of Yiwulü Mountain, historically known as the &quot;Liao Mire&quot; (遼澤, &quot;Liáo zé&quot;) roughly in between the modern Xinmin, Liaozhong, Tai&#x27;an, Panshan and Beizhen). The modern usage of &quot;Liaodong&quot; ,however, simply refers to the half of Liaoning province to the left/east bank of the Liao/Daliao River.

== Geography ==

The Liaodong Peninsula lies on the northern shore of the Yellow Sea, dividing the Liaodong Bay (the largest of the three bays of the Bohai Sea) to its west from the Korea Bay to its east. It forms the southern part of a mountain belt that continues northward in the Changbai Mountains. The part of the mountain range on the peninsula is known as the Qianshan Mountains, named after Qian Mountain in Anshan, which includes Dahei Mountain in Dalian.

== History ==

=== Pre-Han ===

The Liaodong region was settled since prehistoric times by Neolithic people such as Xinle culture. It later came under the rule of the Gojoseon kingdom, which encompassed the northern Korean Peninsula and the region southeast of the Liao River. In the late 4th century BC, the expanding Chinese State of Yan conquered this region from Gojoseon, and established the Liaodong Commandery.

=== Han to Qing ===
After the fall of the Yan state, the region was taken over by the short-lived Qin dynasty, and then its prominent successor Han dynasty. After the Han dynasty fragmented at the turn of the 3rd century, the region changed hands between various warlord states such as the Gongsun Yuan, the nomadic Wuhuan, and Cao Wei, before eventually falling under the reunified Western Jin dynasty.

However, after the Western Jin fell from the Uprising of the Five Barbarians and during the subsequent chaotic Sixteen Kingdoms periods, the region was ruled by Former Yan, Former Qin, Later Yan and later Goguryeo, before being reconquered by the Tang dynasty.

In 698 AD, Wu Zhou&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Tianmenling allowed the newly founded Balhae to rule the region for the next two centuries, before they were supplanted by the Khitan Liao dynasty, and followed by the Jin dynasty, Yuan dynasty, Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty.

Liaodong was the primary destination of Shandong and Hebei refugees from the Northern Chinese Famine of 1876-1879. A prior Qing prohibition on immigration to Northeast China was officially relaxed, marking the start of Chuang Guandong. In 1876, Chinese officials told the Customs commissioner at Yingkou that 600,000 people had landed on the Liaodong Peninsula. Government efforts to keep Manchu heartlands free of Chinese settlement resulted in a concentration of refugees in Liaodong.

=== 19th and 20th century ===
The peninsula was an important area of conflict during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895). Defeat precipitated decline in the Qing dynasty which was exploited by colonial powers who extracted numerous concessions. The peninsula was ceded to Japan, along with Taiwan and Penghu, by the Treaty of Shimonoseki of 17 April 1895. However the ceding of Liaodong peninsula was rescinded after the Triple Intervention of 23 April 1895 by Russia, France and Germany. In the aftermath of this intervention, the Russian government pressured the Qing dynasty to lease Liaodong and the strategically important Lüshunkou (Port Arthur) for use by the Russian Navy.

As in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Liaodong peninsula was the scene of major fighting in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), including the bloody Siege of Port Arthur. As a consequence of the Treaty of Portsmouth (5 September 1905), which ended the Russo-Japanese War, both sides agreed to evacuate Manchuria and return it to China, with the exception of the Liaodong Peninsula leased territory which was transferred to Japan, which was to administer it as the Kwantung Leased Territory.

After Japan lost World War II, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established in 1949, Liaodong was again under unified Chinese rule, where it has been to this day.

<text>The Totonac are an indigenous people of Mexico who reside in the states of Veracruz, Puebla, and Hidalgo. They are one of the possible builders of the pre-Columbian city of El Tajín, and further maintained quarters in Teotihuacán (a city which they claim to have built). Until the mid-19th century they were the world&#x27;s main producers of vanilla. The Totonac people cultivated vanilla in Papantla, but faced with competition when the French island of Réunion entered the market. This group of people also encountered conflicts over land ownership during the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, as the privatization of communal land in Papantla became more of a concern to local elites. 

==Etymology==

The term &quot;totonac&quot; refers to the people living in Totonacapan. There is no agreement as to the origin of the term. Some authors have translated the term &quot;totonac&quot; as a Nahuatl word meaning &quot;People of Hot Land&quot;.
The translation for this word in the Totonac Language, according to sources, is &quot;toto-nacu&quot; meaning &quot;three hearts&quot; signifying their three cities or cultural centers: Cempoala, Tajin and Teayo. Evidence, however, is inconclusive.

==Geography and traditional lifestyle==
In the 15th century, the Aztecs labeled the region of the Totonac &quot;Totonacapan&quot;; which then extended roughly from Papantla in the north to Cempoala in the south. Totonacapan was largely hot and humid. Along with the normal agricultural crops of maize, manioc, squash, beans, pumpkin and chili peppers, the region was noted for its production of cotton. Even during the disastrous central Mexican famine of 1450-1454, the region remained a reliable agricultural center. At that time, many Aztecs were forced to sell themselves or their family members as slaves to the Totonac in exchange for subsistence maize.

===Food culture===
Totonacs in the twentieth century led the peoples growing the highest quality vanilla, and most Mexican vanilla was produced by Totonacs. This widespread vanilla growth vastly shaped their society at the time. Seeking to profit from this vanilla boom, Totonac entrepreneurs pushed for privatization of formally communal lands due to the lands becoming more valuable. This resulted in massive social upheaval due to the longstanding traditions being threatened, and by the start of the 20th century, the old communal lands of the Totonacs had been mostly broken up and privatized.

Their association with agriculture of vanilla pre-dates the arrival of Columbus in the New World. While vanilla was long significant to Totonac culture, its importance as an export good did not emerge until the early-eighteenth century, when they traded with other Totonacs and with people in northern Oaxaca. The first regulation of the harvesting of Mexican vanilla appears in 1743, when the mayor of Papantla attempted to use a law for personal profit on the vanilla harvest. A second law regulating was promulgated in 1767, after Totonac vanilla growers in Colipa complained about thieves stealing immature vanilla pods. During Humboldt&#x27;s travels in Mexico, most European imports of vanilla conveyed through the port of Veracruz, and Totonacs in the Misantla region harvested about 700,000 vanilla beans per year. 

There is a total absence of comals, metates and manos meaning the Totonacs did not eat tortillas; however, even though corn was grown it did not form a large part of their diet. The Totonacs ate fruit, most notably zapotes, guavas, papayas, plantains and avocados. Men hunted and fished shark, turtle, deer, armadillo, opossums, and frogs. Women raised turkeys and dogs. Peasants as well as nobles ate corn porridge in the morning. Lunch was the main meal of the day and consisted of manioc, bean stew or even a rich meat sauce for the nobles. Fish and seafood as well as game was eaten by both nobles and farmers. The agave provided liquor.

===Clothing===
Totonac women were expert weavers and embroiderers; they dressed grandly and braided their hair with feathers. The Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún stated that, in all aspects of their appearance, the women were &quot;quite elegant&quot;, women wore skirts (embroidered for the nobles) and a small triangular poncho covering the breasts. Noble women wore shell and jade necklaces and earrings and often tattooed their faces with red ink. Married women wore their hair in the Nahuatl fashion while peasant women wore their hair long. Likewise, the noble men dressed well, adorning themselves with multicolored cloaks, loin cloths, necklaces, arm bands, lip plugs and devices made of the prized quetzal feathers. Hair was kept long with a thick tuft of hair on the top tied up with a ribbon.

===Housing===
Houses were generally thatched and had an overhang. They were rectangular in shape.

==History==
The region of Totonacapan was subject to Aztec military incursions from the mid-15th century until the Spanish arrival. Despite the establishment of Aztec fortifications throughout the region, rebellion was endemic. Major Totonac centers were Papantla, with an estimated population of 60,000 in 1519, Xalapa (around 120,000), and Cempoala (around 80,000). Cempoala was the first indigenous city state visited by Hernán Cortés in his march to the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán. The Totonacs of Cempoala joined forces with Cortés, and along with the Tlaxcalan people, contributed significantly to the Spanish conquest. Totonacapan became incorporated into the Spanish regime with comparatively little violence, but the region was ravaged by epidemic diseases during the 16th century. Today, approximately 90,000 Totonac speakers reside in the region.

==== Spanish Influence ====
The area around Veracruz is comprised of rainy, hilly, lands, requiring farmers to constantly move to combat verdant overgrowth.  Essentially, it was easier for the Totonacs to clear new patches of land for their agriculture rather than maintain cleared land. Because of constant movement essentially in response to extraordinary verdancy, Totonac people never really had settled community groups due to the need to move to promote their form of agriculture, leading to a culture that could be thought of as regionally nomadic agriculturalists.The Spanish could never truly and completely conquer the Totonacs.  The Spaniards sought two things out of indigenous inhabitants; mining resources (i.e. gold or silver) or settled populations for labor.  Since there was no gold or silver in the Veracruz region, and because of the regionally nomadic community structure, the Totonacs were not candidates for slave labor. In summary, Spanish colonial influence upon the Totonacs was relatively weak when compared with indigenous groups throughout central and south America.

====== Conflict in Papantla ======
In the late 19th century, the vanilla industry in Papantla was still massive, which placed a high value on its land. In 1891, the Mexican government wanted to claim and privatize the land, taking it away from being communally owned by the Totonacs. As Severiano Galicia led officials and troops into Papantla to survey and claim land, Totonac rancheros met them with force. This marked the start of nearly a decade of conflict in Papantla as the divided Totonacs fought either with or against federal troops in order to preserve or privatize the communal Totonac land. Some argue that this conflict directly contributed to the start of the Mexican Revolution as a whole. 

==Language==

The Totonac people traditionally speak Totonac, which, together with Tepehua, form a small language family. This means that Totonacan languages are not related to other Native Mesoamerican languages such as those in the Mayan, Oto-Manguean or Uto-Aztecan families. There are several local varieties of Totonac that are not mutually intelligible. The first grammatical and lexical descriptions of Totonac accessible to Europeans (now lost) were by Fray Andrés de Olmos, who also wrote the first such descriptions of Nahuatl and Huastec (Teenek).

The main varieties of Totonac are:
*Papantla Totonac: spoken by some 80,000 speakers in El Escolín, Papantla, Cazones, Tajín, Espinal, and other towns along the Gulf Coast of Veracruz.
*North-Central Totonac: spoken roughly between Poza Rica in Veracruz and Mecapalapa, Pantepec, and Xicotepec de Juárez in Puebla.
*South-Central Totonac: spoken mostly in the Sierra Norte de Puebla, including the towns of Zapotitlán de Méndez, Coatepec, and Huehuetla in Puebla.
*Misantla Totonac: spoken by fewer than 500 people in Yecuatla and other communities outside the city of Misantla, Veracruz.

== Religion ==
Most present-day Totonacs are Roman Catholic. However, their Christian practice is often mixed with vestiges of their traditional religion, a notable instance being &quot;la Costumbre&quot;, a survival of an old rite of sacrifice in which various seeds are mixed with earth and the blood of fowls and dispersed over the planting fields.

The traditional religion was described in the early 1960s by the French ethnographer, Alain Ichon. No other major essay on Totonac religion has been found. Mother goddesses played a very important role in Totonac belief, since each person&#x27;s soul is made by them. If a newly born child dies, its soul &quot;does not go to the west, the place of the dead, but to the east with the Mothers&quot;. Ichon has also preserved for posterity an important myth regarding a maize deity, a culture hero with counterparts among most other cultures of the Gulf Coast and possibly also represented by the Classic Maya maize god. As to traditional curers, it is believed that they &quot;are born during a storm, under the protection of thunder. They think that a lightning bolt strikes the house of a new-born baby ..., and makes it ... under its possession&quot;.

Other known deities include Chichiní (the sun) and Aktzin.

<doc id="343505" wikidata="Q3108884" url="?curid=343505" title="Wear leveling">
<text>Wear leveling (also written as wear levelling) is a technique for prolonging the service life of some kinds of erasable computer storage media, such as flash memory, which is used in solid-state drives (SSDs) and USB flash drives, and phase-change memory.
The idea underpinning wear leveling is similar to changing position of car tires, avoiding repetitive load from being used on the same wheel. Wear leveling algorithms distribute writes more evenly across the entire device, so no block is used more often than others.

The term &quot;preemptive wear leveling&quot; (PWL) has been used by Western Digital to describe their preservation technique used on hard disk drives (HDDs) designed for storing audio and video data. However, HDDs generally are not wear-leveled devices in the context of this article.

== Rationale ==
EEPROM and flash memory media have individually erasable segments, each of which can be put through a limited number of erase cycles before becoming unreliable. This is usually around 3,000/5,000 cycles but many flash devices have one block with a specially extended life of 100,000+ cycles that can be used by the flash memory controller to track wear and movement of data across segments. Erasable optical media such as CD-RW and DVD-RW are rated at up to 1,000 cycles (100,000 cycles for DVD-RAM media).

Wear leveling attempts to work around these limitations by arranging data so that erasures and re-writes are distributed evenly across the medium. In this way, no single erase block prematurely fails due to a high concentration of write cycles. In flash memory, a single block on the chip is designed for longer life than the others so that the memory controller can store operational data with less chance of its corruption.

Conventional file systems such as FAT, UFS, HFS/HFS+, EXT, and NTFS were originally designed for magnetic disks and as such rewrite many of their data structures (such as their directories) repeatedly to the same area. When these systems are used on flash memory media, this becomes a problem. The problem is aggravated by the fact that some file systems track last-access times, which can lead to file metadata being constantly rewritten in-place.

== Types ==
There are several wear leveling mechanisms that provide varying levels of longevity enhancement in such memory systems.

=== No wear leveling ===
A flash memory storage system with &quot;no wear leveling&quot; will not last very long if data is written to the flash. Without wear leveling, the underlying flash controller must permanently assign the logical addresses from the operating system (OS) to the physical addresses of the flash memory. This means that every write to a previously written block must first be read, erased, modified, and re-written to the same location. This approach is very time-consuming and frequently written locations will wear out quickly, while other locations will not be used at all. Once a few blocks reach their end of life, such a device becomes inoperable.

=== Dynamic wear leveling ===
The first type of wear leveling is called &quot;dynamic wear leveling&quot; and it uses a map to link logical block addresses (LBAs) from the OS to the physical flash memory. Each time the OS writes replacement data, the map is updated so the original physical block is marked as &quot;invalid&quot; data, and a new block is linked to that map entry. Each time a block of data is re-written to the flash memory, it is written to a new location. However, flash memory blocks that never get replacement data would sustain no additional wear, thus the name comes only from the dynamic data being recycled. Such a device may last longer than one with no wear leveling, but there are blocks still remaining as active even though the device is no longer operable.

=== Static wear leveling ===
The other type of wear leveling is called &quot;static wear leveling&quot; which also uses a map to link the LBA to physical memory addresses. Static wear leveling works the same as dynamic wear leveling except the static blocks that do not change are periodically moved so that these low usage cells are able to be used by other data. This rotational effect enables an SSD to continue to operate until most of the blocks are near their end of life.

=== Global wear leveling ===
Both dynamic and static wear leveling are implemented at the local level. This simply means that in a multi-chip product, every chip is managed as a single resource. The number of defective blocks in different chips within a NAND flash memory varies: a given chip could have all its data blocks worn out while another chip in the same device could have all its blocks still active. Global wear leveling addresses this problem by managing all blocks from all chips in the flash memory together―in a single pool. It ensures that all the cells in all the chips within the product are worn out evenly. 

=== Comparison ===
The following table compares static and dynamic wear leveling:

== Techniques ==
There are several techniques for extending the media life:

* A checksum or error-correcting code can be kept for each block or sector in order to detect errors or correct errors.
* A pool of overprovisioned reserve space can also be kept. When a block or sector does fail, future reads and writes to it can be redirected to a replacement in that pool.
* Blocks or sectors on the media can be tracked in a least frequently used (LFU) queue. The data structures for the queue itself must either be stored off-device or in such a way that the space it uses is itself wear-leveled or, in the case of flash memory, in a block with a specially extended life. However, usual cache algorithms are designed to manage the data flow into and out of RAM-based caches, making them not directly suitable for flash-based storage devices as they have an asymmetrical nature reads are usually much faster than writes, and erase operations can be performed only one &quot;block&quot; at a time.
* Garbage collection

On Secure Digital cards and USB flash drives, techniques are implemented in hardware by a built-in microcontroller. On such devices, wear leveling is transparent, and conventional file system such as FAT can be used on them as-is.

Wear leveling can also be implemented in software by special-purpose file systems such as JFFS2 and YAFFS on flash media or UDF on optical media. All three are log-structured file systems in that they treat their media as circular logs and write to them in sequential passes. File systems which implement copy-on-write strategies, such as ZFS, also implement a form of wear leveling.

<text>East Jerusalem (, ; , ) is the portion of Jerusalem that was held by Jordan after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, as opposed to West Jerusalem, which was held by Israel. Under international law, East Jerusalem is considered part of the West Bank, and Palestinian territories, and under illegal occupation by Israel. Many states recognize East Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine (such as Brazil, China, Russia, and all 57 members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation), whereas other states (such as Australia, France and others) assert that East Jerusalem &quot;will be the capital of Palestine&quot;, while referring to it as &quot;an occupied territory&quot;. In 2020, East Jerusalem had a population of 595,000 inhabitants, of which 361,700 (61%) were Palestinian Arabs and 234,000 (39%) Jewish settlers. Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem are illegal under international law and in the eyes of the international community.

Jerusalem was envisaged as a separate, international city under the 1947 UN partition plan. It was, however, divided by the 1948 war that followed Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence. As a result of the 1949 Armistice Agreements, the city&#x27;s western half came under Israeli control, while its eastern half, containing the famed Old City, fell under Jordanian control. Israel occupied East Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War; since then, the entire city has been under Israeli control. The 1980 Jerusalem Law declared unified Jerusalem the capital of Israel, formalizing the effective annexation of East Jerusalem. Palestinians and many in the international community consider East Jerusalem to be the future capital of the State of Palestine. The status of Jerusalem has been described as &quot;one of the most intractable issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict&quot;, with conflicting claims to sovereignty over the city or parts of it, and access to its holy sites.

Israeli and Palestinian definitions of East Jerusalem differ. Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Jerusalem&#x27;s municipal boundaries were extended totaling an area three times the size of pre-war West Jerusalem. This includes several West Bank villages to the north, east and south of the Old City that are now considered neighborhoods of the city, as well as eight suburban neighborhoods that were built since then. The international community considers these neighborhoods illegal settlements, but the Israeli government disputes this. The Israeli position is based on the extended municipal boundaries, while the Palestinian position is based on the 1949 Agreements. 

East Jerusalem includes the Old City, which is home to many sites of seminal religious importance for the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, including the Temple Mount / Al-Aqsa, the Western Wall, the Dome of the Rock and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Arab residents of East Jerusalem are increasingly becoming integrated into Israeli society, in terms of education, citizenship, national service and other aspects.
==Etymology==
On 27 June 1967, Israel expanded the municipal boundaries of West Jerusalem so as to include approximately of West Bank territory today referred to as &quot;East Jerusalem&quot;, which included &quot;Jordanian East Jerusalem&quot; () and 28 villages and areas of the Bethlehem and Beit Jala municipalities .

&quot;East Jerusalem&quot; is the familiar term in English. Arabs largely use the term &quot;Arab Jerusalem&quot; for this area in official English-language documents, emphasizing the predominance of the Arabic-speaking Palestinian population while Israelis call the area &quot;East Jerusalem&quot; because of its geographic location in the east of the expanded Jerusalem.

==History==
===Ancient period===
The area of East Jerusalem has been inhabited since 5000 BCE, with settlement beginning in the Chalcolithic period. Tombs are attested by the Early Bronze Age, around 3200 BCE. In the late second millennium BCE settlement concentrated around the City of David which was chosen because of its proximity to the Gihon Spring. Massive Canaanite constructions were undertaken, with a water channel excavated through rock drawing water to a pool inside the citadel, whose wall was a massive 23 feet thick, built from rocks some weighing up to 3 tons.
===British Mandatory Period===
In 1934, the British Mandatory authorities divided Jerusalem into 12 wards for electoral purposes. The mapping was criticized by those who believed it was drawn to ensure a Palestinian majority on the Jerusalem city council. The actual mapping suggests otherwise, according to Michael Dumper, who states that the peculiar &quot;hook&quot; on the western electoral borders was a gerrymander made to include as many new Jewish neighbourhoods on that side as possible, while keeping outside of the boundaries Arab villages. To the east, the city&#x27;s border ended at the Old City walls, in order to exclude the contiguous Arab neighbourhood of Silwan, Ras al-Amud and At-Tur and Abu Tor. These boundaries defined the municipality down to 1948. By 1947 Palestinian Arabs constituted a majority overall in the Jerusalem district, but Jews predominated within the British municipal boundaries, 99,000 to 65,100 Arabs. The Jewish presence in eastern Jerusalem was concentrated to the Old Quarter, with a scattering also present in Silwan and Sheikh Jarrah.

===1948 Arab–Israeli War and aftermath===
Of the 30 holy places in Jerusalem, only three were located in Western Jerusalem, with the overwhelming bulk lying within the eastern sector. During the subsequent 1948 Arab–Israeli War, a large number of Jerusalem&#x27;s churches, convents, mosques, synagogues, monasteries and cemeteries were hit by shell or gunfire. After the armistice the city was divided into two parts. The western portion came under Israeli rule, while the eastern portion, populated mainly by Muslim and Christian Palestinians, came under Jordanian rule, with the international community withholding recognition of the respective areas of control of both parties.

During the Battle for Jerusalem, fighting in the Jewish quarter between the Jordanian Arab Legion and the IDF, Irgun and Lehi had been particularly fierce, leaving the zone in ruins. The battle and subsequent looting by Palestinian civilians left 27 synagogues and 30 schools destroyed. The Jordanian army is said to have blown up, three days after conquering the area, what remained of the Hurva Synagogue, which had served both as a civilian refuge and Israeli military post.

For Palestinians, expulsions from the Jerusalem area date back to January 1948, when the Haganah bombed the Semiramis Hotel in Qatamon. The death of 26 civilians marked the beginning of evacuation of the area, which increased after the nearby Deir Yassin massacre in early April, followed by a 3-day assault and looting from 30 April onwards. In the first six months of the 1948 war 6,000 Jews also abandoned the city, and when war broke out, thousands fled the northern areas subject to Jordanian shelling. After the surrender to the Jordanian Arab Legion, the Red Cross, which had been invested with the authority to protect many major sites, oversaw the evacuation westwards through Zion Gate of some 1,300 Jews from the Old Quarter. The only eastern area of the city that remained in Israeli hands throughout the 19 years of Jordanian rule was Mount Scopus, where the Hebrew University is located, which formed an enclave during that period. Likewise, Palestinians living in such western Jerusalem neighbourhoods as Qatamon, Talbiya, Baq&#x27;a, &#x27;Ayn Karim, Lifta and Malha either fled or were forced out, many of them seeking refuge in the Old City.

East Jerusalem absorbed thousands of Palestinian refugees, a substantial number of whom were middle-class people from West Jerusalem&#x27;s Arab neighborhoods when they came under Israeli rule, and many were settled in the previous Jewish areas of the eastern sector, whose inhabitants, likewise refugees, were relocated in the formerly majority-Arab suburbs of West Jerusalem, such as Overall; as a result of the conflict, the Jewish population of Jerusalem fell by 30–40%, while Eyal Benvenisti states half of its Palestinian population of 60,000 left. According to the Jordanian census of 1952, East Jerusalem had an Arab population of 46,700.

===Jordanian rule===

Jerusalem was to be an international city under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. It was not included as a part of either the proposed Jewish or Arab states. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the western part of Jerusalem was captured by Israel, while East Jerusalem (including the Old City) was captured by Jordan. The war came to an end with the signing of the 1949 Armistice Agreements. On 23 January 1950, Israel declared Jerusalem its capital, with a Knesset resolution declaring that, &quot;With the creation of a Jewish State, Jerusalem again became its capital&quot;. Jordan followed suit on 24 April and, on the basis of a referendum conducted also among Palestinian West Bankers, the Hashemite Kingdom incorporated the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The unification was recognized by the United Kingdom, which however stipulated that they did not recognize the assertion of Jordanian sovereignty over East Jerusalem, but only &quot;de facto&quot; control. The United States, while approving the unification, withheld making any public statement and likewise affirmed that since the issue of Jerusalem was &quot;sub judice&quot;, it did not recognize either the Israeli annexation of West Jerusalem, nor the Jordanian annexation of the eastern area of the city.

The municipal boundaries of Jordanian East Jerusalem were expanded to cover by taking in the nearby villages of Silwan, Ras al-Amud Aqabat al-Suwana, &#x27;Ard al-Samar and parts of Shuafat. This expansion of the boundaries was prompted in large part by the need to cope with housing the refugee flow of Palestinians from West Jerusalem. While many municipal functions were shifted to Amman, in 1953, Jordan conferred on East Jerusalem the status of &quot;amana&quot; (trusteeship)- in response to Israel efforts to make West Jerusalem Israel&#x27;s capital- effectively making the city Jordan&#x27;s second capital. The political motive behind the transfer of the bureaucracy to Amman lay in the desire to
weaken the power of the rival al-Husayni family.

Generally, the Jordanian authorities maintained the Ottoman &quot;status quo&quot; with regard to sacred sites in East Jerusalem. When the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, always an object of bitter contention between Greek Orthodox and Latin Christians, was engulfed in flames and severely damaged on 29 November 1949, the Vatican proposed the Tesla plan, which foresaw a reconstruction involving the demolition of the existing church and a contiguous mosque and its replacement by a predominantly Catholic-style structure. Jordan&#x27;s King Abdullah gave his assent, on one condition he knew would be impossible to fulfill and therefore would abort the project. He stipulated that to go ahead, all involved denominations would have to approve the plan, which would have given the Catholic Church a primacy of authority over the others. Repairs were delayed a decade until a consensus was achieved between the Greek, Latin, and Armenian clerics (excluding the Copts), with Jordan playing a pivotal role as mediator.

In the early 1960s, Jordan gave the go-ahead for the construction of the Intercontinental Hotel on the Mount of Olives on waqf terrain expropriated in 1952 from the family of Abd al-Razzaq al-&#x27;Alami. Three roads, one an access route built through the Jewish Har HaZeitim Cemetery damaged many gravestones, though opinions differ as to the scale of the damage. For Yitzhak Reiter, the majority of graves were unaffected. According to Michael Fischbach, 40,000 of the 50,000 tombstones suffered some form of desecration. The Israeli government protested the desecration, stating that some gravestones had been used for roadwork and a military latrine. This East Jerusalem controversy inverted the terms of an earlier dispute when Jordan complained in 1950 of Israeli damage to the Mamilla cemetery in West Jerusalem.

Tourism in Palestine had long been an undeveloped and marginal sector of the local economy, and, with the division of Jerusalem after 1948, political issues impeded its commercial development as a tourist destination. Eastern Jerusalem suffered an outflow of population, partially accounted for by merchants and administrators moving to Amman. On the other hand, it maintained its religious importance, as well as its role as a regional center. Reaffirming a 1953 statement, Jordan in 1960 declared Jerusalem its second capital. The US (and other powers) protested this plan, and stated it could not &quot;recognize or associate itself in any way with actions which confer upon Jerusalem the attributes of a seat of government...&quot;

During the 1960s, Jerusalem saw economic improvement and its tourism industry developed significantly, and its holy sites attracted growing numbers of pilgrims, but as Jordan did not recognize Israeli passports, neither Jewish nor Muslim Israelis were allowed access to their traditional sites of worship in East Jerusalem, though Israeli Christians, with a special &quot;laissez-passer&quot;. were permitted to visit Bethlehem over Christmas and the New Year.

===Israeli rule===
===After 1967 war===

Following the 1967 Six-Day War, the eastern part of Jerusalem came under Israeli rule, along with the entire West Bank. Shortly after the Israeli takeover, East Jerusalem was absorbed into West Jerusalem, together with several neighboring West Bank villages. In November 1967, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 was passed, calling for Israel to withdraw &quot;from territories occupied in the recent conflict&quot; in exchange for peace treaties. In 1980, the Knesset passed the Jerusalem Law, which declared that &quot;Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel&quot;, which is commonly called an act of annexation, though no such formal measure was taken. This declaration was determined to be &quot;null and void&quot; by United Nations Security Council Resolution 478.

David Ben-Gurion presented his party&#x27;s assertion that &quot;Jewish Jerusalem is an organic, inseparable part of the State of Israel&quot; in December 1949, and Jordan annexed East Jerusalem the following year. These decisions were confirmed respectively in the Israeli Knesset in January 1950 and the Jordanian Parliament in April 1950. When occupied by Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War, East Jerusalem, with expanded borders, came under direct Israeli rule, an effective de facto annexation. In a unanimous General Assembly resolution, the United Nations declared the measures changing the status of the city to be invalid.

In the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)&#x27;s Palestinian Declaration of Independence of 1988, Jerusalem is stated to be the capital of the State of Palestine. In 2000, the Palestinian Authority passed a law proclaiming Jerusalem as its capital, and in October 2002, this law was approved by chairman Yasser Arafat. Since that time Israel has shut down all offices and NGO organisations connected to the PLO in East Jerusalem, saying that the Oslo Accords do not permit the Palestinian National Authority to operate in Jerusalem. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) recognised East Jerusalem as capital of the State of Palestine on 13 December 2017.

==Overview==
On 28 June 1967, Israel extended Israeli &quot;law, jurisdiction and administration&quot; to the area of East Jerusalem, without naming it, by incorporating it into its municipality of West Jerusalem. Internally, this move was explained as one of annexation, integrating that part of the city into Israel. Towards the international community, which was critical, it was justified as a purely technical measure, to provide equal administrative services to all its residents, and not annexation, and the same applied to Israel&#x27;s assertion of a claim of sovereignty on the passage of the 30 July 1980 Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel. The United Nations Security Council censured Israel for the move and declared the law &quot;null and void&quot; in United Nations Security Council Resolution 478, and the international community continues to regard East Jerusalem as held under Israeli occupation. Israel then disbanded the elected Arab municipal council placing it under the administration of West Jerusalem&#x27;s mayor Teddy Kollek.

A problem arose when it was noted that East Jerusalem also had a mayor, Ruhi al-Khatib, and an elected 11 other members on the Jordanian city council. Uzi Narkiss realized the Arab council had not been dismissed. He therefore ordered the deputy military governor, Ya&#x27;akov Salman, to depose the council. Salman was at a loss as to how this measure could be executed, but Narkiss insisted he find some grounds for doing so. Eventually, Salman summoned Khatib and 4 other members to the Gloria Hotel restaurant, and read out a short statement in Hebrew.
In the name of the Israeli Defense Forces, I respectfully inform Mr Ruhi al-Khatib and members of the Jerusalem City Council that the Council is hereby dissolved.
al-Khatib demanded the order in writing, and an Arabic translation was written out on a napkin. According to Uzi Benzamin, the Israeli journalist who wrote up the encounter, &quot;the whole episode lacked any shred of legality&quot;. Soon after al-Khatib, who had worked for an orderly transition, was deported to Jordan for organizing protests.

Services like electricity supply were transferred from Palestinian to Israeli companies, and a ministerial decision established a policy that the ratio of Jews to Palestinians, as a matter of policy, would be 76 to 24, though the 2000 Masterplan adjusted this to a 70-30 ratio, which in turn had to be subject to a 60-40% proportion given Palestinian demographic growth, which now constitutes 37% of the city&#x27;s population. When offered a path to Israeli citizenship, the overwhelming majority opted for resident status instead, and adopted a boycott strategy against Israeli institutions. 90% of the land of East Jerusalem included thereafter in its municipality was added after 1967 by expropriating in most cases village or private land owned by people who were living in 28 Palestinian villages. According to its former deputy mayor, Meron Benvenisti, the plan was designed in such a way as to incorporate a maximum of land with a minimum of Arabs.
Thereafter, a property tax (&quot;arnona&quot;) regime was introduced which allowed Jewish settlers a 5-year exemption and then reduced taxes, while leaving Jerusalemite West Bankers, whose zones are classified to be in the high-property-tax bracket, paying for 26% of municipal services, while themselves receiving only 5% of the benefit (2000). By 1986, 60% of Arab East Jerusalem lacked a garbage-collection infrastructure, and schools could not expand classrooms and were forced into a unique double-shift system. Jewish neighbourhoods were allowed to build up to eight storeys high, while Palestinians in East Jerusalem were restricted to two. The area&#x27;s infrastructure still remains in a state of neglect. According to B&#x27;Tselem, as of 2017, the 370,000 overcrowded West Bankers in this zone are bereft of any control over their lives, given extreme restrictions on the movement of residents without any advance notice. Their residency can be revoked; building permits are rarely given and a separation wall fences them off from the rest of the city. Every day 140,000 Palestinians have to negotiate checkpoints to work, get a medical check-up or visit friends. Poverty has steadily increased among them, with 77% of &quot;non-Jewish&quot; households in Jerusalem under the Israeli poverty line, as opposed to 24.4% of Jewish families (2010).

An International Crisis Group report of 2012 described the effects of Israeli policies: cut off from trade with the West Bank by the Separation Barrier, denied political organization – which Israel&#x27;s counter-terrorism agency includes as &quot;political subversion&quot; – by the closure of the PLO&#x27;s Orient House, it is an &quot;orphan city&quot; hemmed in by flourishing Jewish neighbourhoods. With local construction blocked, the Palestinian neighbourhoods have become slums, where even the Israeli police will not venture except for security reasons, so that criminal businesses have thrived.

===Territorial modifications===
The extension of Israeli jurisdiction into East Jerusalem and its surroundings on into the municipality of Jerusalem involved the inclusion of several neighboring villages, expanding the municipality area of Jordanian East Jerusalem by integrating into it a further of West Bank territory, while excluding many of East Jerusalem&#x27;s suburbs, such as Abu Dis, Al-Eizariya, Beit Hanina and Al-Ram, and dividing several Arab villages. Israel refrained however from endowing citizenship – a mark of annexation — on the Palestinians incorporated within the new municipal borders.

The old Mughrabi Quarter in front of the Western Wall was bulldozed three days after its capture, leading to the forced resettlement of its 135 families. It was replaced with a large open-air plaza. The Jewish Quarter, destroyed in 1948, was depopulated, rebuilt and resettled by Jews.

====After 1980 incorporation====

Under Israeli rule, members of all religions are largely granted access to their holy sites, with the Muslim Waqf maintaining control of the Temple Mount and the Muslim holy sites there.

With the stated purpose of preventing infiltration during the Second Intifada, Israel decided to surround Jerusalem&#x27;s eastern perimeter with a security barrier. The structure has separated East Jerusalem neighborhoods from the West Bank suburbs, all of which are under the jurisdiction of Israel and the IDF. The planned route of the separation barrier has raised much criticism, with the Israeli Supreme Court ruling that certain sections of the barrier (including East Jerusalem sections) must be re-routed.

In the Oslo Accords, the PLO conceded that the question of East Jerusalem be excluded from the interim agreement, and be left to final status negotiations. Under the pretext that they are part of the PA, Israel closed many Palestinian NGOs since 2001.

At the 25 January 2006 Palestinian Legislative Elections, 6,300 East Jerusalem Arabs were registered and permitted to vote locally. All other residents had to travel to West Bank polling stations. Hamas won four seats and Fatah two, even though Hamas was barred by Israel from campaigning in the city. Fewer than 6,000 residents were permitted to vote locally in the prior 1996 elections.

In March 2009, a confidential &quot;EU Heads of Mission Report on East Jerusalem&quot; was published, in which the Israeli government was accused of &quot;actively pursuing the illegal annexation&quot; of East Jerusalem. The report stated: &quot;Israeli &#x27;facts on the ground&#x27; – including new settlements, construction of the barrier, discriminatory housing policies, house demolitions, restrictive permit regime and continued closure of Palestinian institutions – increase Jewish Israeli presence in East Jerusalem, weaken the Palestinian community in the city, impede Palestinian urban development and separate East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank.&quot;

In 2018, &quot;Al Bawaba&quot; reported that Israel had approved the construction of 640 new &quot;Jewish-only&quot; housing units in the ultra-orthodox Ramat Shlomo settlement. Some of these units will be built on privately owned Palestinian lands. According to B&#x27;tselem, the Israeli authorities have destroyed 949 Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem since 2004, resulting in the displacement of over 3,000 Palestinians. Since 2016 there has been a notable uptick in demolitions, with 92 razed that year. In the first ten months of 2019 over 140 homes were demolished, leaving 238 Palestinians, 127 of them minors, homeless.

A poll among East Jerusalem Arab residents in 2011, conducted by the Palestinian Center for Public Opinion and American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations, revealed that 39% of East Jerusalem Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship contrary to 31% who opted for Palestinian citizenship. According to the poll, 40% of Palestinian residents would prefer to leave their neighborhoods if they would be placed under Palestinian rule.

As of 1998, Jerusalem&#x27;s religious heritage consists of 1,072 synagogues, 52 mosques, 65 churches and 72 monasteries.

==Status==

===Sovereignty===
East Jerusalem has been occupied by Israel since 1967 and has been effectively annexed, in an act internationally condemned, by Israel in 1980. On 27–28 June 1967, East Jerusalem was integrated into Jerusalem by extension of its municipal borders and was placed under the law, jurisdiction and administration of the State of Israel. In a unanimous General Assembly resolution, the UN declared the measures trying to change the status of the city invalid.

In a reply to the resolution, Israel denied these measures constituted annexation and contended that it merely wanted to deliver services to its inhabitants and protect the Holy Places. Some lawyers, among them Yehuda Blum and Julius Stone, have argued that Israel has sovereignty over East Jerusalem under international law, since Jordan did not have legal sovereignty over the territory, and thus Israel was entitled in an act of self-defense during the Six-Day War to &quot;fill the vacuum&quot;. This interpretation is a minority position, and international law considers all the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) to be occupied territory and call for Palestinians in the occupied territories (including East Jerusalem) to be given self-determination

Israel has never formally annexed Jerusalem, nor claimed sovereignty there but its extension of Israeli law and administration there in 1967, and the Jerusalem Basic Law of 1980 are often taken as constituting an effective or de facto annexation. The Israeli Supreme Court recognized that East Jerusalem had become an integral part of the State of Israel, ruling that even if Knesset laws contravene international law, the court is bound by domestic law and therefore considers the area annexed. According to lawyers, the annexation of an area would automatically make its inhabitants Israeli citizens, a condition lacking and East Jerusalem&#x27;s Palestinians have the status of &quot;permanent residents&quot;. The United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19 of 2012 affirmed that East Jerusalem forms a part of Occupied Palestine Territory.

Historically, defining a Palestinian position on Jerusalem and East Jerusalem proved difficult, given the political conflicts that arose between strategies proposed by the local East Jerusalemite establishment led by Faisal Husseini and those of the PLO under Yasser Arafat regarding the processes to be chosen to define the city&#x27;s Palestinian status.

===Negotiations on &quot;&quot;share&quot; or &quot;divide&quot;&quot;===

Both the Oslo Accords and the 2003 Road map for peace postponed the negotiations on the status of Jerusalem. The 1997 Beilin–Eitan Agreement between some members of the Likud block and Yossi Beilin, representing Labor, which envisioned for final negotiations a limited autonomy to a demilitarized &quot;Palestinian entity&quot; surrounded on all sides by Israel, stated that all of Jerusalem would remain unified under Israeli sovereignty. Beilin suggested Palestinians would accept a capital outside of Jerusalem in Abu Dis, which undermined the credibility of the document in Palestinian eyes.

Israel&#x27;s settlement policy in East Jerusalem has been described by Avi Shlaim and others as one aiming to preempt negotiations by creating facts on the ground.

The Beilin–Abu Mazen agreement of 1995, suggested while Israel would not accept challenges to its political sovereignty over all of Jerusalem it might, with the idea of a &quot;holy basin&quot;, theoretically allow Palestinian extraterritorial sovereignty over a part of the East Jerusalem area, with Palestinians directly controlling the Noble Sanctuary, while Jews would obtain religious rights over the Temple Mount. This view, splitting religious and political authority, was unacceptable to Hamas and Arafat soon disowned the idea. At the 2000 Camp David Summit, it was agreed there could be no return to the pre-1967 Jerusalem lines of demarcation; that Israel&#x27;s unilaterally imposed municipal boundaries were not fixed; that just as Israel&#x27;s expansion there would be larger than mapped just after 1967, so too the Palestinian expansion would stretch out to take in villages not connected to the city earlier; that Jerusalem would remain a single unified metropolitan unit not divided by an international border, and under the governance of two distinct municipal authorities, with one under full Palestinian sovereignty and serving as the capital of the State of Palestine, exercising full powers in most parts of East Jerusalem. An exchange of neighbourhoods was envisaged, with Israel taking sovereignty over Ma&#x27;ale Adumim, Givat Ze&#x27;ev and Gush Etzion, while excluding areas earlier included, such as Sur Baher, Beit Hanina and Shu&#x27;afat. During the last serious negotiations in 2008 with the government of Ehud Olmert, Olmert, on 16 September, included a map which foresaw a shared arrangement over Jerusalem, with Israeli settlements remaining in Israel and Palestinian neighbourhoods part of a Palestinian state and constituting their future capital. The &quot;Holy Basin&quot;, including the Old City, would be under joint trusteeship overseen by Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United States and the state of Palestine. Olmert showed, but would not share, the map with Mahmood Abbas, who was forced to make a copy of it on a napkin.

===Jerusalem as capital===

While both Israel and Palestine declared &quot;Jerusalem&quot; their capital, the Palestinians usually refer to &quot;East&quot; Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine.

In 1980, the Knesset adopted the &quot;Jerusalem Law&quot; as a Basic Law, declaring Jerusalem &quot;complete and united&quot;, &quot;the capital of Israel&quot;. The law applied to both West and East Jerusalem within, among others, the expanded boundaries as defined in June 1967. While the Jerusalem Law has political and symbolic importance, it added nothing to the legal or administrative circumstance of the city.

The Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles (Oslo I), signed 13 September 1993, deferred the settlement of the permanent status of Jerusalem to the final stages of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

The Beilin-Abu Mazen Plan stated that, &quot;Israel will recognize that the (portion of) the area defined as &#x27;Al-Quds&#x27; prior to the six day war which exceeds the area annexed to Israel in 1967 will be the capital of the Palestinian state&quot;. This formulation was based, according to Tanya Reinhart, on a verbal trick in that, by conferring on Abu Dis, which was within the Jordanian municipality of Jerusalem but outside Israel&#x27;s redefinition, the title &quot;the holy city&quot; referring in Arabic to Jerusalem, Israel could assert that it was acceding to the idea of dividing Jerusalem. Arafat concurred with this Israeli proposal, and Israel asserted a pre-condition, namely, that all Palestinian institutions be removed from Jerusalem proper and transferred to Abu Dis. In compliance, the Palestinians built their government offices and a proposed future parliament house there, but an undertaking to transfer Abu Dis, and the neighbouring Al-Eizariya into Area C, under full Palestinian autonomy, was never fulfilled. Ehud Barak had, it is reported, before the Camp David talks, reneged on this promise which was personally conveyed to the Palestinians through President Bill Clinton. Barak remained committed to a unified Israeli Jerusalem, the default position of all Israeli governments who regard its division as non-negotiable.

At the Taba Summit in 2001 Israel made substantial concessions regarding territory but not sufficient to permit a contiguous Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem.

====Position of the United States====
The United States refers to East Jerusalem as part of &quot;the West Bank – the larger of the two Palestinian territories&quot;, and refers to Israeli Jews living in East Jerusalem as &quot;settlers&quot;.

American policy on Jerusalem, despite a standard refrain of &quot;continuity,&quot; has been altered repeatedly since 1947, exhibiting sometimes drastic fluctuations since 1967. Historically, up to 1967, it had viewed East Jerusalem as forming part of the West Bank, a territory under belligerent occupation. On 1 March 1990, President George H. W. Bush stated publicly, the first time for an American president, an objection to Israeli building in East Jerusalem. That same year, the United States Congress unanimously adopted the Senate&#x27;s Concurrent Resolution 106, affirming its belief that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city with the Senate Concurrent Resolution 113 of 1992. This was sponsored by AIPAC and, according to John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, was a &quot;transparent attempt to disrupt the peace process&quot;. In the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 8 November 1995 it set 1999 as the final date whereby the U.S. embassy was to be relocated to that city, stating Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of Israel, and that no more than 50% of State Department funds for building abroad should be allocated until the embassy was established there. Provision was made for the exercise of a presidential waiver.

In 1991, as part of a preparatory gesture before the Madrid Peace Conference, the United States in a &quot;Letter of Assurances to the Palestinians&quot; (15 October 1991) stated that the United States undertook to act as an honest broker and expressed opposition to any unilateral measures that might prejudice peace talks, a statement the Palestinians understood to refer to Israeli settlements and policy in Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the subsequent Clinton Administration refused to characterize East Jerusalem as being under occupation and viewed it as a territory over which sovereignty was undefined. Vice President Al Gore stated that the U.S. viewed &quot;united Jerusalem&quot; as the capital of Israel. In 2016, U.S. presidential election candidate Donald Trump vowed to recognize all of Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel if he won the election. In 2017, President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital, and, on 14 May 2018, the United States moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On 8 December 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson clarified that the President&#x27;s statement &quot;did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;was very clear that the final status, including the borders, would be left to the two parties to negotiate and decide.&quot;

When U.S. President Joe Biden visited Israel and Palestine in 2022, his delegation removed the Israeli flags from his vehicle upon entering East Jerusalem, in a move widely interpreted as signaling non recognition of Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem.

==Urban planning==
The term &quot;East Jerusalem&quot; sometimes refers to the area which was incorporated into the municipality of Jerusalem after 1967, covering some , while sometimes it refers to the smaller area of the pre-1967 Jordanian-controlled part of the Jerusalem municipality, covering . 39 percent (372,000) of Jerusalem&#x27;s 800,000 residents are Palestinian, but the municipal budget allocates only 10% of its budget to them.

East Jerusalem has been designed to become an Israeli Jewish city surrounding numerous small enclaves, under military control, for the Palestinian residents. The last link in the chain of settlements closing off East Jerusalem from the West Bank was forged in 1997 when Binyamin Netanyahu approved, as part of what he perceived as a battle for the city, the construction of the settlement of Har Homa.

According to the Israeli non-governmental organization B&#x27;Tselem, since the 1990s, policies that made construction permits harder to obtain for Arab residents have caused a housing shortage that forces many of them to seek housing outside East Jerusalem. East Jerusalem residents that are married to residents of the West Bank and Gaza have had to leave Jerusalem to join their husbands and wives due to the citizenship law. Many have left Jerusalem in search of work abroad, as, in the aftermath of the Second Intifada, East Jerusalem has increasingly been cut off from the West Bank and thereby has lost its main economic hub. Israeli journalist Shahar Shahar argues that this outmigration has led many Palestinians in East Jerusalem to lose their permanent residency status.

According to the American Friends Service Committee and Marshall J. Breger, such restrictions on Palestinian planning and development in East Jerusalem are part of Israel&#x27;s policy of promoting a Jewish majority in the city.

On 13 May 2007, the Israeli Cabinet began a discussion regarding a proposal to expand Israel&#x27;s presence in East Jerusalem and boost its economy so as to attract Jewish settlers. To facilitate more Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, the Cabinet is now considering an approximately 5.75 billion NIS plan to reduce taxes in the area, relocate a range of governmental offices, construct new courthouses, and build a new center for Jerusalem studies. Plans to construct 25,000 Jewish homes in East Jerusalem are in the development stages. As Arab residents are hard-pressed to obtain building permits to develop existing infrastructure or housing in East Jerusalem, this proposition has received much criticism.

According to Justus Weiner of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the Jerusalem municipality granted the Arab sector 36,000 building permits, &quot;more than enough to meet the needs of Arab residents through &quot;legal&quot; construction until 2020&quot;. Both Arabs and Jews &quot;typically wait 4–6 weeks for permit approval, enjoy a similar rate of application approvals, and pay an identical fee ($3,600) for water and sewage hook-ups on the same size living unit&quot;. Weiner writes that while illegal Jewish construction typically involves additions to existing legal structures, illegal Arab construction involves the construction of entire multi-floor buildings with 4 to 25 living units, built with financial assistance from the Palestinian National Authority on land not owned by the builder.

A European Union report of March 2010 has asserted that 93,000 East Jerusalem Palestinians, 33% of the total, are at risk of losing their homes, given Israeli building restrictions imposed on them, with only 13% of the municipal territory allowed for their housing, as opposed to 53% for Jewish settlement. It wrote further that in 2013 98 such buildings were demolished, leaving 298 people homeless, while a further 400 lost their workplace and livelihoods, and that 80% live below the poverty level. 2,000 Palestinian children, and 250 teachers in the sector must pass Israeli checkpoints to get to school each day.

Jewish neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem have 30 times the number of playgrounds that Palestinian areas have. One was built for the 40,000 strong community of Sur Baher with Belgian funding in 2015 after a Jerusalem court directed the municipal council to begin constructing them. It was constructed without a permit, and the Israeli authorities say the difference is due to the difficulty of finding vacant lots suitable to playgrounds in the Arab sectors.

The annual number of building permits granted for construction in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem have expanded by 60% since Donald Trump became US president in 2017. Since 1991, Palestinians, who make up the majority of the residents in East Jerusalem, have only received 30% of building permits.

In 2021, Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court had been expected to deliver a ruling on 10 May 2021 on whether to uphold the eviction of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood that had been permitted by a lower court. In May 2021, clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police occurred over the anticipated evictions.

==Demographics==

In the 1967 census, the Israeli authorities registered 66,000 Palestinian residents (44,000 residing in the area known before the 1967 war as East Jerusalem; and 22,000, in the West Bank area annexed to Jerusalem after the war). Only a few hundred Jews were living in East Jerusalem at that time, since most Jews had been expelled in 1948 during the Jordanian rule.

By June 1993, a Jewish majority was established in East Jerusalem: 155,000 Jews were officially registered residents, as compared to 150,000 Palestinians.

At the end of 2008, the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem&#x27;s residents. Of these, 195,500 (43%) were Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of Jerusalem as a whole), and 260,800 (57%) were Arabs. Of the Arabs, 95% were Muslims, comprising 98% of the Muslim population of Jerusalem, and the remaining 5% were Christians. In 2008, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem was 208,000 according to a recently completed census.

At the end of 2008, East Jerusalem&#x27;s main Arab neighborhoods included Shuafat (38,800), Beit Hanina (27,900), the Muslim Quarter of the Old City (26,300), At-Tur including As-Sawana (24,400). East Jerusalem&#x27;s main Jewish neighborhoods include Ramot (42,200), Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev (42,100), Gilo (26,900), Neve Yaakov (20,400), Ramat Shlomo (15,100) and East Talpiot (12,200). The Old City (including the already mentioned Muslim Quarter) has an Arab population of 36,681 and a Jewish population of 3,847.

In 2016, the population of East Jerusalem was 542,400, comprising 61% of Jerusalem&#x27;s residents. Of these, 214,600 (39.6%) were Jews, and 327,700 (60.4%) were Arabs.

According to Peace Now, approvals for building in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem has expanded by 60% since Trump became US president in 2017. Since 1991, Palestinians who make up the majority of the residents in the area have only received 30% of the building permits.

Among the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, the northern neighborhoods tend to be wealthy, while the southeastern neighborhoods are home to a poorer population whose origins are more often rural or tribal. Many of the wealthier Arabs have moved there from northern Israel. About half of Jerusalem Arabs, though, have their ancestry in the Hebron region.

===Residency and citizenship===

Following the 1967 war, Israel conducted a census in East Jerusalem and granted permanent Israeli residency to those Arab Jerusalemites present at the time of the census. Those not present lost the right to reside in Jerusalem. Jerusalem Palestinians are permitted to apply for Israeli citizenship, provided they meet the requirements for naturalization—such as swearing allegiance to Israel and renouncing all other citizenships—which most of them refuse to do. At the end of 2005, 93% of the Arab population of East Jerusalem had permanent residency and 5% had Israeli citizenship. 

Between 2008 and 2010, approximately 4,500 Palestinian residents in East Jerusalem applied for Israeli citizenship, of which one third were accepted, one third rejected, and one third had the decision postponed.

As residents, East Jerusalemites without Israeli citizenship have the right to vote in municipal elections and play a role in the administration of the city. Residents pay taxes, and following a 1988 Israeli Supreme Court ruling, East Jerusalem residents are guaranteed the right to social security benefits and state health care. Until 1995, those who lived abroad for more than seven years or obtained residency or citizenship in another country were deemed liable to lose their residency status. In 1995, Israel began revoking permanent residency status from former Arab residents of Jerusalem who could not prove that their &quot;center of life&quot; was still in Jerusalem. This policy was rescinded four years later. In March 2000, the Minister of the Interior, Natan Sharansky, stated that the &quot;quiet deportation&quot; policy would cease, the prior policy would be restored, and Arab natives to Jerusalem would be able to regain residency if they could prove that they have visited Israel at least once every three years. Since December 1995, permanent residency of more than 3,000 individuals &quot;expired&quot;, leaving them with neither citizenship nor residency. Despite changes in policy under Sharansky, in 2006 the number of former Arab Jerusalemites to lose their residency status was 1,363, a sixfold increase on the year before.

Over 95% of East Jerusalemite Palestinians retain residency status rather than citizenship. Application for citizenship have grown from 69 (2003) to over 1,000 (2018) but obtaining Israel citizenship has been described as an uphill battle, with the number of applicants who receive a positive response meager. Obtaining an appointment for an interview alone can take 3 years followed by another 3 to 4 years to obtain a decision one way or another. Of 1,081 requests in 2016 only 7 were approved, though by 2018, 353 approvals were given to the 1,012 Palestinians applying. Lack of sufficient fluency in Hebrew, suspicions the applicant might have property in the West Bank, or be a security risk (such as having once visited a relative gaoled on security grounds) are considered impediments.

East Jerusalem residents are increasingly becoming integrated into Israeli society. Trends among East Jerusalem residents have shown: increasing numbers of applications for an Israeli ID card; more high school students taking the Israeli matriculation exams; greater numbers enrolling in Israeli academic institutions; a decline in the birthrate; more requests for building permits; a rising number of East Jerusalem youth volunteering for national service; a higher level of satisfaction according to polls of residents; increased Israeli health services; and a survey showing that in a final agreement more East Jerusalem Palestinians would prefer to remain under Israeli rule. According to Middle East expert David Pollock, in the hypothesis that a final agreement was reached between Israel and the Palestinians with the establishment of a two-state solution, 48% of East Jerusalem Arabs would prefer being citizens of Israel, while 42% of them would prefer the State of Palestine. 9% would prefer Jordanian citizenship.

==Healthcare==
Until 1998, residents of East Jerusalem were disadvantaged in terms of healthcare service and providers. By 2012, almost every neighborhood in East Jerusalem had health clinics that included advanced medical equipment, specialized ER units, X-ray diagnostic centers and dental clinics. Israel&#x27;s system of healthcare entitles all Israeli citizens and East Jerusalem residents to receive free healthcare service funded by the Israeli government.

According to Haaretz in 2015, the quality of healthcare centers between Israeli cities and East Jerusalem are almost equal. The health quality indices in East Jerusalem increased from a grade of 74 in 2009 to 87 in 2012, which is the same quality grade the clinics in West Jerusalem received.B&#x27;tselem maintains that, despite constituting 40% of Jerusalem&#x27;s population, the municipality only runs six healthcare centers in the Palestinian sector, compared to the 27 run by the state in Jewish neighbourhoods. According to ACRI, only 11% of the residents of East Jerusalem are treated by the welfare services. In 2006 64% of the Palestinian population lived below the poverty line. By 2015 75%, and 84% of their children, were living below the poverty line.

In 2018, President Donald Trump&#x27;s administration cut $25 million from hospitals in East Jerusalem that specialized in cancer care for Palestinians. The cut in funds covers 40% of the running costs for 6 hospitals providing treatment for patients from both the Gaza Strip and the broader West Bank where treatment is unavailable. The shortfall was thought to put at serious risk the viability of both Augusta Victoria Hospital and Saint John Eye Hospital. The sum saved was to be redirected to &quot;high-priority projects&quot; elsewhere.

==Culture==

Jerusalem was designated the Arab Capital of Culture in 2009. In March 2009, Israel&#x27;s Internal Security Minister responded with a number of injunctions, banning scheduled cultural events in the framework of this designation in Jerusalem, Nazareth and in other parts of the Palestinian Territories. The Minister instructed Israel Police to &quot;suppress any attempts by the PA to hold events in Jerusalem and throughout the rest of the country&quot;. The minister issued the ban on the basis that the events would be a violation of a clause in the interim agreement between Israel and the Palestinians that forbids the Palestinian Authority (PA) from organizing events in Israeli territory.

On 22 June 2013, the Israeli Public Security Minister closed the El-Hakawati Theater for eight days, to prevent a puppet theater festival with an 18-year tradition. Israel Security Agency Shin Bet accused the Palestinian Authority of funding the child-festival, which was denied by the theater director. A month later, members of Israel&#x27;s theater world held a protest.

On 29 June 2013, Israel denied members of the &quot;Ramallah Orchestra&quot; from the Al Kamandjâti music school access to East Jerusalem, where they were to give a concert in the French St. Anne&#x27;s church. Nevertheless, after the musicians had climbed over the Separation Wall, the concert eventually took place.

==Environment==
East Jerusalem has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because its walls and old buildings provide nesting sites for a population of lesser kestrels, with some 35–40 breeding pairs estimated in 1991. The city, especially the Mount of Olives region, also underlies a white stork migration route.

==Economy==
May 2013, UNCTAD published the first comprehensive investigation into the East Jerusalem economy undertaken by the United Nations. The report concluded that the Israeli occupation had caused the economy to shrink by half in the last 20 years compared to West Bank and Gaza Strip, which it described as &quot;a dismal testament to the decline of the East Jerusalem economy and its growing isolation under prolonged occupation&quot;, that resulted in the economic isolation of Palestinian residents. It found a 77% to 25% differential in the number of households living below the poverty line in non-Jewish and Jewish households respectively, with the differential in child poverty being 84% for Palestinian children as opposed to 45% for Jewish children. Major problems were said to be restrictions on movement of goods and people, which Israel says are imposed for security reasons, and Israeli neglect of &quot;dire socio-economic conditions&quot;. UNCTAD said &quot;the Israeli government could go much further in meeting its obligations as an occupying power by acting with vigour to improve the economic conditions in East Jerusalem and the well-being of its Palestinian residents&quot;. The Palestinians&#x27; governor of Jerusalem said &quot;some relaxation of the political situation&quot; was required for the economy to improve.

==Education==
According to the Israeli Education Ministry, the number of East Jerusalem high school students who took Israeli matriculation exams rose from 5,240 in 2008 to 6,022 in 2011. There are 10 schools in East Jerusalem that specialize in preparing East Jerusalem students for Israeli universities and colleges; one of the biggest schools is the Anta Ma&#x27;ana (&quot;You are with us&quot;) Institute on Al-Zahara Street.

East Jerusalem has a shortage of schools for Palestinian children. In 2012, the classroom shortage was reportedly 1,100, due to what &quot;Haaretz&quot; described as &quot;years of intentional neglect of East Jerusalem schools, which serve the Arab population by the Education Ministry and the city&quot;. A relatively high dropout rate of schoolchildren is found in the Arab sector, even 40% among 12th graders in 2011.

Schools in East Jerusalem include:
* Schmidt&#x27;s Girls College

==Mayors==

* Anwar Khatib (1948–1950)
* Aref al-Aref (1950–1951)
* Hannah Atallah (1951–1952)
* Omar Wa&#x27;ari (1952–1955) 
* Ruhi al-Khatib (1957–1967)
* Ruhi al-Khatib (1967–1994; titular)
* Amin al-Majaj (1994–1999; titular)
* Zaki al-Ghul (1999–2019; titular)

<text>Emperor Shun of Han (; 115 – 20 September 144) was an emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty and the eighth emperor of the Eastern Han. He reigned from December 125 to September 144.

Emperor Shun (Prince Bao) was the only son of Emperor An of Han. After Emperor An died in April 125, the Empress Dowager Yan, childless but yearning to hold on to power, displaced Prince Bao (whose title of crown prince she had wrongly caused Emperor An to strip in 124) from the throne in favour of Liu Yi, the Marquess of Beixiang. After Liu Yi died after reigning less than seven months, eunuchs loyal to Prince Bao, led by Sun Cheng, carried out a successful coup d&#x27;etat against the Empress Dowager, and Prince Bao was declared emperor at age 10.

The people had great expectations for Emperor Shun, whose reign followed his incompetent and violent father. However, while Emperor Shun&#x27;s personality was mild, he was just as incompetent as his father and corruption continued without abatement among eunuchs and officials. He also overly entrusted government to his wife Empress Liang Na&#x27;s father Liang Shang () - a mild-mannered man with integrity but little ability - and then Liang Shang&#x27;s son Liang Ji - a corrupt and autocratic man. In general, Emperor Shun&#x27;s reign was an improvement over his father&#x27;s, but this minor improvement was unable to stem the Eastern Han dynasty&#x27;s continued decline.

Emperor Shun died at the age of 29 after reigning for 19 years. He was succeeded by his son Emperor Chong.

==Family background==
Prince Bao was born to Emperor An and his concubine Consort Li in 115, apparently shortly after Emperor An had created his favourite Yan Ji empress. Empress Yan had no sons, and out of jealousy, she poisoned Consort Li to death, an act that went unpunished. Empress Yan would continue to hold a grudge against Prince Bao, despite his youth. At the time of his birth, his father Emperor An was still in the shadow of Empress Dowager Deng Sui.

On 25 May 120, Emperor An created Prince Bao crown prince, as he was Emperor An&#x27;s only son. Empress Dowager Deng died in April 121; with her death, Emperor An was finally able to exercise power on his own.

==Removal as crown prince and enthronement==
In 124, some of the people trusted by Emperor An, eunuchs Jiang Jing () and Fan Feng () and his wet nurse Wang Sheng (), for reasons no longer known, falsely accused Crown Prince Bao&#x27;s wet nurse Wang Nan () and chef Bing Ji (邴吉, not to be confused with Emperor Xuan&#x27;s prime minister of the same name) of unspecified crimes. Emperor An executed Wang and Bing and exiled their families. The nine-year-old crown prince was greatly saddened. Jiang and Fan, fearful of reprisals later, entered into a conspiracy with Empress Yan (who had always hated Crown Prince Bao since he was not her own son) to falsely accuse Crown Prince Bao and his servants of crimes. Emperor An believed them and demoted Crown Prince Bao to be the Prince of Jiyin.

In April 125, Emperor An died suddenly while on a trip to Wancheng (宛城, in modern Nanyang, Henan). Although Prince Bao was Emperor An&#x27;s only son and therefore logical heir, Empress Yan resolved to make someone younger to be the emperor so that she could better control him. She therefore made Liu Yi (), the Marquess of Beixiang, emperor. The 10-year-old Prince Bao was excluded not only from succession but even from the official mourning for his father. Empress Dowager Yan and her brothers dominated the political scene.

Later that year, the young emperor was gravely ill. The eunuch Sun Cheng, loyal to Prince Bao, entered into a conspiracy with Prince Bao&#x27;s head of household, Changxing Qu (), and other eunuchs to restore Prince Bao. After the young emperor died, Sun and 18 of his fellow eunuchs made a surprise attack on the palace, killing Jiang and forcing Jiang&#x27;s colleague Li Run () to join them. They then welcomed Prince Bao to the palace and declared him emperor. For several days, the eunuchs&#x27; forces battled with the empress dowager&#x27;s forces, finally defeating the empress dowager and her brothers. The Yan clan was slaughtered, while Empress Dowager Yan was confined to her palace until her death in February 126.

==Early reign==
At the start of Emperor Shun&#x27;s reign, the people were hopeful that he would reform the political situation from the pervasive corruption under the Yans. However, the teenage emperor proved to be a kind but weak ruler. While he trusted certain honest officials, he also trusted many corrupt eunuchs, who quickly grabbed power. In 126, Sun Cheng tried to encourage the young emperor to carry out extensive reforms, but was instead removed from the capital for his audacity. Sun was recalled to the capital in 128, but continued to lack any influence to put into effect concrete reforms. Another major influence on Emperor Shun was his wet nurse Song E (), who was described as a kind woman. But she lacked the ability to be an effective advisor to the Emperor. Rather, she took on the role of an empress dowager.

Early in Emperor Shun&#x27;s reign, Ban Chao&#x27;s son, Ban Yong, was able to effectively restore Han suzerainty over Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia) kingdoms, but in 127, Ban Yong was falsely accused of being late in arriving for a military action and removed from his office. After Ban Yong&#x27;s removal, the situation in Xiyu gradually deteriorated.

Other than these events, the rule of Emperor Shun was generally one during which the empire avoided periods of political turmoil. Although the emperor lacked capability, and corruption continued to run unchecked, his personal kindness allowed the people a measure of peace.

In 131, Emperor Shun wanted to create an empress, and not wanting to play favourites, he considered drawing lots before the gods to determine who should be the empress. After his officials discouraged him from this action, he finally selected one of his consorts, Liang Na, as the one he considered most virtuous and most rational. He created her empress in March 132. She was 16 and he was 19. Her father Liang Shang () became an honoured official and was gradually promoted to increasingly important posts.

==Late reign==
In 135, two major political changes occurred. Eunuch-marquesses began to be allowed to pass their marches to their adopted sons, and Liang Shang became the commander of the armed forces and effectively the most powerful individual in the imperial government. Neither of these developments appeared at the time to be major, but had great implications. The former demonstrated that the power of the eunuchs was becoming systemic, and the latter led to the start of the Liangs controlling the imperial government for several administrations.

Liang Shang was, much like his son-in-law, a kind man who lacked any real political abilities, even though he appeared to be honest, compassionate and ethical. For example, in 138, when there was a conspiracy by some eunuchs to undermine him that Emperor Shun discovered, he advocated leniency, and while Emperor Shun did not completely agree with him, Liang&#x27;s intercession clearly saved many lives. However, both he and Emperor Shun trusted his son Liang Ji () who, unlike his father, was corrupt and violent.

From 136 to 138, there were a number of native rebellions in various parts of southern China. While these were generally put down with relative ease (in particular, the rebels generally surrendered willingly if the corrupt officials they were protesting against were replaced by Emperor Shun), these would foreshadow the much more serious rebellions that would come in the next few decades. Further, in 139, the Qiang again rebelled, and this time the rebellion would not be put down easily and would plague Emperor Shun for the rest of his reign. Indeed, in 141, the Qiang forces annihilated a Han force led by Ma Xian () and set fire to the tomb-gardens of a number of Western Han emperors in the Chang&#x27;an region. Further, agrarian rebellions started in Jing (荊州, modern Hunan, Hubei, and southern Henan) and Yang (揚州, modern Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and central and southern Jiangsu, Anhui) Provinces and would not be pacified for the rest of Emperor Shun&#x27;s reign.

In September 141, Liang Shang died. Inexplicably, Emperor Shun gave his post to Liang&#x27;s son Liang Ji and gave Liang Ji&#x27;s post to his younger brother Liang Buyi (). Liang Ji proceeded to seize power at every opportunity, and even though Liang Buyi tried to encourage his brother to be moderate in his behaviour, his pleas fell on deaf ears.

In 144, apparently already ill, Emperor Shun created his only son Liu Bing (), born of his concubine Consort Yu in 143, crown prince. Later that year, Emperor Shun died, and Crown Prince Bing succeeded him as Emperor Chong. Empress Dowager Liang served as regent, and while she personally appeared capable, her trust in her brother Liang Ji would lead to a further decline in the standing of the Eastern Han. On 26 October 144, Emperor Shun was buried and given the temple name &quot;Jingzong&quot;. However, in 190, during the reign of Emperor Xian of Han, Emperor Shun&#x27;s temple name was revoked. At the same time, the posthumous title of &quot;Empress Gongmin&quot; (恭愍皇后), which was granted to his mother Consort Li on 7 July 127, was also revoked.
