<text>Merthyr Tydfil () is the main town in Merthyr Tydfil County Borough, Wales, administered by Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council. It is about north of Cardiff. Often called just Merthyr, it is said to be named after Tydfil, daughter of King Brychan of Brycheiniog, who according to legend was slain at Merthyr by pagans about 480 CE. generally means &quot;martyr&quot; in modern Welsh, but here closer to the Latin : a place of worship built over a martyr&#x27;s relics. Similar place names in south Wales are Merthyr Cynog, Merthyr Dyfan and Merthyr Mawr.

Noted for its industrial past, Merthyr was known as the &#x27;Iron Capital of the World&#x27; in the early 19th century, due to the scale of its iron production. The world&#x27;s first steam-powered railway journey happened in Merthyr in 1804, travelling from the ironworks at Penydarren to the Glamorganshire Canal on the Merthyr Tramroad. The 1851 census found Wales to be the world&#x27;s first industrialised nation, as more people were employed in industry than agriculture, with Merthyr the biggest town in Wales at that time. The city of Donetsk in Ukraine (then in the Russian Empire), originally &#x27;Hughesovka&#x27;, was founded by John Hughes of Merthyr in 1870, when he took iron working to the area. Iron production declined in Merthyr from 1860 on, though Merthyr&#x27;s population continued to rise due to the emergence of coal mining in the area, peaking with around 81,000 people in 1911. 

The area is currently known for its industrial heritage and adventure tourism. Merthyr and the surrounding areas boast the Grade-I listed Cyfarthfa Castle, the world’s fastest seated zip line, the UK&#x27;s largest mountain bike park, the largest indoor climbing wall in Wales, national cycle routes and plans for the UK&#x27;s longest indoor ski slope.

==History==
===Pre-history===
Peoples migrating north from Europe had lived in the area for many thousands of years. The archaeological record starts from about 1000 BCE with the Celts. From their language, the Welsh language developed. Hillforts were built during the Iron Age and the tribe that inhabited them in the south of Wales was called the Silures, according to Tacitus, the Roman historian of the Roman invaders.

===The Roman invasion===
The Romans arrived in Wales by about 47–53 CE and established a network of forts, with roads to link them. They had to fight hard to consolidate their conquests, and in 74 CE they built an auxiliary fortress at Penydarren, overlooking the River Taff. It covered an area of about three hectares, and formed part of the network of roads and fortifications; remains were found underneath the Merthyr Town F.C. football ground. A road ran north–south through the area, linking the southern coast with Mid Wales and Watling Street via Brecon. Parts of this and other roads, including &quot;Sarn Helen&quot;, can be traced and walked.

The Silures resisted this invasion fiercely from their mountain strongholds, but the Roman army eventually prevailed. In time, relative peace was established, and the Penydarren fortress was abandoned by about 120 CE. This was bad for the local economy, which had come to rely upon supplying the fortress with beef and grain, and imported items such as oysters from the coast. The Romans had intermarried with local women and many auxiliary veterans had settled on farms locally.

With the decline of the Roman Empire, Roman legions were withdrawn about 380 CE. By 402, the Roman army in Britain consisted mostly of Germanic troops and local recruits; the cream of the army had been withdrawn to the continent of Europe. Sometime in that period, Irish Dalriadans (Scots) and Picts attacked and breached Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. During the 4th and 5th centuries the coasts of Cambria (Wales) had been subject to the raids of Irish pirates, in much the same way as the south and east coasts of Britain had been raided by Saxon pirates from across the North Sea. Around the middle of the 5th century, Irish settlements had been established around Swansea, the Gower Peninsula, Carmarthenshire, and in Pembrokeshire and eventually petty kingdoms were established as far inland as Brecon.

===The coming of Christianity===
The Latin language and some Roman customs and culture became established before the withdrawal of the Roman army. The Christian religion was introduced throughout much of Wales by the Romans, but locally it may have been introduced later by monks from Ireland and France, who made their way into the region following rivers and valleys.

===Local legends===
Local tradition holds that, around 480 CE, a girl called Tydfil, daughter of a local chieftain named Brychan, was an early local convert to Christianity, and was murdered by either Welsh or Saxon pagans, and buried in the town. The girl was considered a martyr after her death. &quot;Merthyr&quot; translates to &quot;martyr&quot; in English, and tradition holds that when the town was founded, the name was chosen in her honour. A church was eventually built on the traditional site of her burial.

===The Normans===
For several hundred years the valley of the River Taff was heavily wooded, with a few scattered farms on the mountain slopes. Norman barons moved in after the Norman Conquest of England, but by 1093 they occupied only the lowlands; the uplands remained in the hands of the local Welsh rulers. There were conflicts between the barons and the families descended from the Welsh princes, and control of the land passed to and fro in the Welsh Marches. During this time Morlais Castle was built two miles north of the town.

===Early modern Merthyr===
No permanent settlement was formed until well into the Middle Ages. People continued to be self-sufficient, living by farming and later by trading. Merthyr was little more than a village. An ironworks existed in the parish in the Elizabethan period, but it did not survive beyond the early 1640s at the latest. In 1754, it was recorded that the valley was almost entirely populated by shepherds. Farm produce was traded at a number of markets and fairs, notably the Waun Fair above Dowlais.

===The Industrial Revolution===
====Influence and growth of iron industry====

Merthyr was close to reserves of iron ore, coal, limestone, timber and water, making it an ideal site for ironworks. Small-scale iron working and coal mining had been carried out at some places in South Wales since the Tudor period, but in the wake of the Industrial Revolution the demand for iron led to the rapid expansion of Merthyr&#x27;s iron operations. By the peak of the revolution, the districts of Merthyr housed four of the greatest ironworks in the world: Dowlais Ironworks, Plymouth Ironworks, Cyfarthfa Ironworks and Penydarren. The companies were mainly owned by two dynasties, the Guest and Crawshay families.

Starting in the late 1740s, land within the Merthyr district was gradually being leased for the smelting of iron to meet the growing demand, with the expansion of smaller furnaces dotted around South Wales. By 1759, with the management of John Guest, the Dowlais Ironworks was founded. This would later become the Dowlais Iron Company and also the first major works in the area. Following the success at Dowlais, Guest took a lease from the Earl of Plymouth which he used to build the Plymouth Ironworks. However, this was less of a success until the arrival in 1763 of a &quot;Cumberland ironmaster, Anthony Bacon, who leased an area of eight miles by five for £100 a year on which he started the Cyfarthfa Ironworks and also bought the Plymouth Works&quot;. After the death of Anthony Bacon in 1786, the ownership of the works passed to Bacon&#x27;s sons, and was divided between Richard Hill, their manager and Richard Crawshay. Hill now owned the Plymouth Iron Works and Crawshay the works at Cyfarthfa. The fourth ironworks was Penydarren, built by Francis Homfray and his son Samuel Homfray in 1784.

It was the need to export goods from Cyfarthfa that led to the construction of the Glamorganshire Canal running from their works right down the valley to Cardiff Bay, stimulating other businesses along the way.
During the first few decades of the 19th century, the ironworks at Cyfarthfa (and neighbouring Dowlais) continued to expand, and at their height were the most productive ironworks in the world: 50,000 tons of rails left just one ironworks in 1844, for the railways across Russia to Siberia. With the growing industry in Merthyr, several railway companies established routes linking the works with ports and other parts of Britain. They included the Brecon and Merthyr Railway, Vale of Neath Railway, Taff Vale Railway and Great Western Railway. They often shared routes to allow access to coal mines and ironworks through rugged country, which presented great engineering challenges. According to David Williams, in 1804, the world&#x27;s first railway steam locomotive, &quot;The Iron Horse&quot;, developed by the Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick, pulled 10 tons of iron with passengers on the new Merthyr Tramroad from Penydarren to Quakers Yard. He also claims that this was the &quot;first &#x27;railway&#x27; and the work of George Stephenson was merely an improvement upon it&quot;. A replica of this locomotive is in the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea. The tramway passed through what is arguably the oldest railway tunnel in the world, part of which can be seen alongside Pentrebach Road at the lower end of the town. The demand for iron was also fuelled by the Royal Navy, which needed cannon for its ships, and later by the railways. In 1802, Admiral Lord Nelson visited Merthyr to witness cannon being made.

Famously, upon visiting Merthyr in 1850, Thomas Carlyle wrote that the town was filled with such &quot;unguided, hard-worked, fierce, and miserable-looking sons of Adam I never saw before. Ah me! It is like a vision of Hell, and will never leave me, that of these poor creatures broiling, all in sweat and dirt, amid their furnaces, pits, and rolling mills.&quot;

====Living conditions in the China district====
China was the name given to a nineteenth-century slum in the Pont-Storehouse area of Merthyr Tydfil. This was not a &#x27;Chinatown&#x27; in the modern sense, and its residents were mainly English, Irish and Welsh. The inhabitants of China were seen as a separate class, away from the respectable areas of Merthyr, and were clearly recognisable by their lifestyle and appearance. In his article, &quot;In search of the Celestial Empire&quot;, historian Keith Strange compares China to areas of Liverpool, Nottingham and Derby, and states that this area was just as bad if not worse than those &quot;little Sodoms&quot;.

There were at least 1,500 people living in the slum, the inhabitants of which were the poorest of society and had a bad reputation. Their living conditions were some of the most squalid in Britain. The slum was based around narrow streets, badly ventilated and full of crowded houses that led to festering diseases. China became known as &quot;Little Hell&quot; and was notorious for having no toilets but open sewers, which caused diseases such as cholera and typhoid.

====The Merthyr Rising====

With the Industrial Revolution came a sharp decline in young men working in agriculture, who were attracted by higher wages paid in industries such as iron. In 1829, the depression hit Merthyr hard, as ironmasters responded with dismissals, wage cuts and short-term working. Any sudden downturn in the market plunged workers into hardship, widening the class distinctions.

The Merthyr Rising of 1831 was precipitated by ruthless collection of debts, frequent wage reductions, and imposition of truck shops. Some workers were paid in specially minted coins or credit notes known as &quot;truck&quot;, which could be spent only at shops owned by their employers. Many workers objected to the price and quality of goods sold there. Throughout May 1831, the coal miners and others who worked for William Crawshay took to the streets of Merthyr Tydfil, calling for reform, and protesting against the lowering of their wages and general unemployment.

Between 7,000 and 10,000 workers marched, and for four days magistrates and ironmasters were under siege in the Castle Hotel, with the protesters effectively controlling the town. Soldiers called in from Brecon clashed with the rioters, and several on both sides were killed. Despite the hope of negotiating with the owners, the skilled workers lost control of the movement. Several supposed leaders of the riots were arrested. One of them, Richard Lewis, popularly known as Dic Penderyn, was hanged for stabbing a soldier in the leg, becoming known as the first local working-class martyr. It was claimed in 1876 that it was not Lewis who stabbed Black, but another man, Ianto Parker, who fled to America after the incident to avoid prosecution. Such claims have never been fully verified, although Lewis&#x27;s innocence is widely accepted in Merthyr.

The Chartist movement of 1831 did not consider the reforms put forward by The Reform Act of 1832 to be extensive enough.

===The &quot;Pen-y-Darren&quot; locomotive===
In 1802, Homfray, the Master of the Penydarren Ironworks, commissioned engineer Richard Trevithick to build one of his high-pressure steam engines to drive a hammer at the Penydarren Ironworks. With the assistance of works engineer Rees Jones, Trevithick mounted the engine on wheels and turned it into a locomotive. In 1803, Trevithick sold the patents for his locomotives to Homfray.

Homfray was so impressed with Trevithick&#x27;s locomotive that he made another bet with Crawshay, this time for 500 guineas so that it could haul 10 tons of iron along the Merthyr Tydfil Tramroad from Penydarren to Abercynon , a distance of . Amid great public interest on 21 February 1804, it successfully carried 11.24 tons of coal, five wagons and 70 men over the full distance in 4 hours and 5 minutes, at an average speed of . As well as Homfray, Crawshay and the passengers, other witnesses included Mr Giddy, a respected patron of Trevithick, and an &quot;engineer from the Government&quot;. The latter was probably a safety inspector, who would have been particularly interested in the boiler&#x27;s ability to withstand high steam pressures. This allowed others to develop Trevithick&#x27;s ideas; some claim the modern railway system was born in Merthyr Tydfil. In modern Merthyr, behind the monument to Trevithick&#x27;s locomotive, is a stone wall, the sole remainder of the former boundary wall of Penydarren House. There is a full-scale working replica of Trevithick&#x27;s 1804 steam-powered railway locomotive in the National Waterfront Museum, Swansea.

===The decline of coal and iron===

The population of Merthyr reached 51,949 in 1861, but then went into decline for several years. As the 19th century progressed, Merthyr&#x27;s inland location became increasingly disadvantageous for iron production. Penydarren closed in 1859 and Plymouth in 1880; thereafter some ironworkers migrated to the United States or even Ukraine, where Merthyr engineer John Hughes established an ironworks in 1869, creating the new city of Donetsk in the process.

In the 1870s, the advent of coal mining to the south of the town gave renewed impetus to the local economy and population growth. New mining communities developed at Merthyr Vale, Treharris and Bedlinog, and the population of Merthyr rose to a peak of 80,990 in 1911. The growth of the town led to a grant of county borough status in 1908.

A prime example of the decline is the Cyfarthfa Ironworks. The actions, or inactions, of Robert Crawshay (&quot;The Iron King&quot;) can be seen as the main reasons for its downfall. The Crawshays refused to modernise by replacing iron production with steel production, using the newly discovered Bessemer process. This led to closure of the works in 1874, which caused economic hardship and unemployment in Merthyr.
After Robert&#x27;s death in 1879 his son William Thompson Crawshay took over the Cyfarthfa works. William finally modernised the works, introducing steel production. However it took until 1882 to get the works back up and running. It never fully caught up with other steel-making areas and closed again in 1910. Despite a comeback during the First World War, it finally closed in 1919. The local steel and coal industries began to decline after the war. By 1932, more than 80 per cent of men in Dowlais were unemployed; 27,000 people emigrated from Merthyr in the 1920s and 1930s, and a Royal Commission recommended that the town&#x27;s county borough status be withdrawn. The fortunes of Merthyr revived temporarily during World War II, as war industry reached the area.

===Post-Second World War===
Immediately after the Second World War, several large companies set up in Merthyr. In October 1948, the American-owned Hoover Company opened a large washing machine factory and depot in the village of Pentrebach, a few miles south of the town. The factory was purpose-built to manufacture the Hoover electric washing machine; at one point, Hoover was the largest employer in the borough. Later the Sinclair C5 was built in the same factory.

Hoover and other companies targeted Merthyr; its declining coal and iron industries gave space for new businesses to start up there and grow. There were then increasing numbers of unemployed workers in the area and, since the Second World War, this has included women too. &quot;Initially 350 people were employed, by the mid 1970s that number had risen to near 5,000; making Hoover the largest employer in the borough&quot;, therefore strongly filling in for the declining coal and iron industries.

The strong growth of employment of women in Merthyr after the Second World War can be seen as a result of the introduction of more light manufacturing and consumer-based business – a stark contrast to the heavy industry in the coal and ironworks which had an almost entirely male workforce.

Several other companies built factories, including the aviation components company Teddington Aircraft Controls, which opened in 1946 and closed in the early 1970s. The Merthyr Tydfil Institute for the Blind, founded in 1923, is the oldest active manufacturer in the town.

Cyfarthfa, the former home of the ironmaster William Crawshay II, an opulent mock castle, is now a museum. It houses a number of paintings of the town, a large collection of artefacts from the town&#x27;s Industrial Revolution period, and a notable collection of Egyptian tomb artefacts, including several sarcophagi.

In 1992, while testing a new angina treatment in Merthyr Tydfil, researchers discovered that the new drug had erection-stimulating side effects for some of the healthy volunteers in the trial study. This discovery formed the basis for Viagra.

In 2006, inventor Howard Stapleton, based in Merthyr Tydfil, developed the technology that gave rise to the recent mosquitotone or Teen Buzz phenomenon.

In September 2021, Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council announced a bid to apply for city status, to be coordinated by urban economic and social researcher Dr Jane Croad.

==The Welsh language==
Use of the Welsh language in the town declined significantly in the late 19th and 20th centuries. In the 1891 census, 68.4 per cent of the 110,569 inhabitants habitually spoke Welsh. By the 1911 Census, the figure had fallen to 50.9 per cent of 74,596 inhabitants. The 2011 census showed 8.9 per cent primarily speaking Welsh.

Merthyr Tydfil hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1881 and 1901 and the national Urdd Gobaith Cymru Eisteddfod in 1987. Merthyr has 3 Welsh medium primary schools, with the third opening in 2022. There are also calls for a Welsh medium secondary school to be built in Merthyr.

==Industrial legacy==
Founded on heavy industry, Merthyr became the ‘&#x27;Iron Capital of the World&#x27;’ and Wales&#x27; largest town the early 19th century. However, despite its long and varied industrial heritage with the decline of heavy industry and the closure of long-established nearby collieries and ironworks, Merthyr could not offer the employment it had previously. This led to marked economic challenges for the area, particularly in the 20th century. 

In 2006, a Channel 4 series ranked Merthyr Tydfil as the United Kingdom&#x27;s third-worst place to live. In the 2007 edition of the same series, Merthyr had improved to fifth-worst. However complaints about the show led to an investigation by regulator Ofcom, which noted the programme had been guilty of &quot;unfortunate and avoidable&quot; factual inaccuracies. 

More recent commentary cites a growth in desirability due to various renovation projects and an increasing tourism sector. In 2021 Merthyr Tydfil local authority area had a 27.9% house price increase over the 12 months of the year, the highest of any of the 22 local authority areas in Wales. The area was second highest in Wales from 2018 to 2019.

Cyfarthfa Castle, a castellated mansion built for the Ironmasters of Cyfarthfa, is now a museum and art shop, attracting almost 7 million day visits in a year. Further plans report a 50 million renovation planned of the Castle and its surrounding areas, including rescuing the 200-year-old Cyfarthfa furnaces west of the Taff, a scheduled ancient monument of world importance, but currently endangered.

Cefn Coed viaduct is the third largest in Wales and now a Grade II listed building. It is a picturesque part of the Taff Trail cycle path linking Cardiff to Brecon.

Merthyr Tydfil Town Hall has been given a new lease of life as an arts and creative industries centre. The Grade-II listed terracotta building, opening originally in 1896 having taken 35 years to build, has had an £8 million refurbishment finishing in 2014.

The four-storey, Grade-II listed YMCA building, also with terracotta-faced structure, is undergoing an £8.6million refurbishment. Originally created by leading Welsh architect Sir Percy Thomas in 1911, it is planned to be a hub for economic and social activity.

==Open-cast mining==
In 2006, a large open-cast coal mine to extract 10 million tonnes of coal over 15 years was authorised just east of Merthyr, as part of the Ffos-y-fran open-cast mine.

==Government==
The parish of Merthyr Tydfil was made a local board district in 1850, which became an urban district in 1894. The urban district was made a municipal borough in 1905, with eight electoral wards. Merthyr Tydfil was granted county borough status in 1908, making it independent from Glamorgan County Council. From 1974 to 1996 the borough reverted to being a lower-tier district council, with Mid Glamorgan County Council providing county-level services in the area. The borough was also enlarged in 1974, gaining Vaynor from Brecknockshire and Bedlinog from Gelligaer Urban District.

In 1996, Mid Glamorgan County Council was abolished and the borough council took over its functions in the area, being renamed Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council. The council governs the town and the wider Merthyr Tydfil County Borough, which stretches as far south as Treharris and Bedlinog. The town includes the electoral wards of Park, Penydarren, Cyfarthfa, Gurnos, Dowlais, Vaynor, and Town.

The Member of Parliament for the Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney constituency is Gerald Jones; the Senedd member is Dawn Bowden MS.

==Religion==
===Anglican churches===

Merthyr was regarded as a nonconformist stronghold in the 19th century, but the chapels declined rapidly from the 1920s onwards and most are now closed.

The Church of England (now the Church in Wales) sought to counterbalance the influence of nonconformity in the 19th century and Merthyr had a succession of notable parish priests. Among them was John Griffith, rector of Merthyr from 1858 until his death in 1885. Griffith had previously been the incumbent at Aberdare, where he had created controversy for his evidence to the commissioners preparing the 1847 Education Reports. His views became more tempered over time. Griffith&#x27;s move to Merthyr Tydfil saw him take over a much larger and more established parish than Aberdare. He became less than popular with the church authorities, however, as a result of his support for disestablishment. In July 1883 he stated &quot;I have been for years convinced that nothing but Disestablishment, the separation of the Church from the State, can ever reform the Church in Wales.&quot;

Griffith&#x27;s funeral was said to have been attended by 12,000–15,000 people. &quot;I venture to declare,&quot; wrote one correspondent, &quot;no man in this part of the kingdom could be more popular in his day and generation than the Rev. John Griffith.&quot; Among the nonconformist ministers present was an old rival, Dr Thomas Price of Aberdare.

Another influential character was Sir John Guest, who contributed greatly to the building of St John&#x27;s Church, Dowlais. Despite the generally small congregations of Anglican churches, St John&#x27;s thrived: it held two services in English each Sunday and also two in Welsh. This church was significant in the plan to counterbalance nonconformity in Merthyr. In 2019 the church was converted into residential flats which retain the original structure.

===Nonconformity===
Merthyr was notable in the 19th and early 20th centuries for a large number of nonconformist places of worship, most holding services in Welsh.

One of the earliest was Ynysgau Chapel, which dated from 1749. It was demolished in 1967 as part of the Merthyr Town Improvement Scheme. The original cause at Ynysgau was established by various &quot;dissenters&quot; from the Church of England. It had been acquired by the Independents (Congregationalists) by the early 19th century.

Other early chapels were Zion and Ebenezer (Baptists), Zoar and Bethesda (Independents) and Pontmorlais (Calvinistic Methodists).

===The Merthyr Hebrew Congregation===
Merthyr Tydfil had the largest Jewish community in Wales in the 19th century, reaching 400 at its height. As the Jewish population had increased, Merthyr Hebrew Congregation was founded in 1848 and a cemetery consecrated a few years later at Cefn-Coed. Merthyr Synagogue was built in 1875. Religious services ceased when it had a male Jewish congregation of under ten, the minyan (quorum) required for them.

In 1978, the building was given Grade II* listing, changed to Grade II in 1983. In the 1980s, the 120-year-old synagogue was sold and became a Christian Centre, then a gym. In 2009, permission was obtained to turn it into flats. In 2019 it was bought by the Foundation for Jewish Heritage, which plans to open as a Jewish Heritage Centre in 2025.

==Culture==

The town&#x27;s many cultural events include local poets and writers holding poetry evenings and music festivals organised at Cyfarthfa Castle and Park. Menter Iaith Merthyr Tudful (the Merthyr Tydfil Welsh Language Initiative) has successfully transformed the Zoar Chapel and adjacent vestry building in Pontmorlais into a community arts venue, Canolfan Soar and Theatr Soar, which run a programme of performance events and activities in both Welsh and English, together with a cafe and a bookshop specialising in local interest and Welsh language books and CDs.

Merthyr Tydfil Housing Association, in partnership with Canolfan Soar, has raised funds to turn the Pontmorlais area into a cultural quarter. With references to the 1831 Merthyr Rising and red bricks for its frontage, an arts and creative industries centre named Redhouse Cymru was launched in Merthyr Tydfil Town Hall on Saint David&#x27;s Day 2014. The town&#x27;s several choirs – Dowlais Male Voice Choir, Ynysowen Male Voice Choir, Treharris Male Voice Choir, Merthyr Tydfil Ladies Choir, Con Voce, Cantorion Cyfarthfa, St David&#x27;s Church Choir, St David&#x27;s Choral Scholars, Merthyr Aloud and Tenovus – perform locally and abroad and in the media.

Merthyr has several historical and heritage groups:
* Merthyr Tydfil Heritage Regeneration Trust aims to preserve for the benefit of the residents... and the Nation at large whatever of the Historical, Architectural and Constructional Heritage may exist in and around Merthyr Tydfil in the form of buildings and artefacts of particular beauty or of Historical, Architectural or Constructional interest and also to improve, conserve and protect the environment thereto.&quot;
* Merthyr Tydfil Historical Society sets out &quot;to advance the education of the public by promoting the study of the local history and architecture of Merthyr Tydfil&quot;.
* Merthyr Tydfil Museum and Heritage Groups aspire &quot;to advance the education of the public by the promotion, support and improvement of the Heritage of Merthyr Tydfil and its Museums.&quot;

Merthyr&#x27;s Central Library holds a prominent position in the town centre, as a Carnegie library. Merthyr hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1881 and 1901 and the national Urdd Gobaith Cymru Eisteddfod in 1987. Like nearby Aberdare, it is known for its music scene. Several bands have achieved national success, including The Blackout and Midasuno. From 2011 to 2014, the town held a Merthyr Rock Festival at Cyfarthfa Park. To complement this, the town holds the Merthyr Rising each year – a three-day celebration of town history through local music, held on the site of the Rising itself in Penderyn Square at the junction of Castle Street and High Street.

==Tourism==
The town lies the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park and is also well-placed for visitors to the South Wales Valleys. The remains of Morlais Castle are on the northern edge of Merthyr Tydfil, the Norman castle was reportedly never completed. The Brecon Mountain Railway is a narrow-gauge tourist railway that runs up the Taf Fechan valley from Pant on the outskirts of Merthyr Tydfil, using five miles of trackbed of the abandoned Brecon &amp; Merthyr Railway.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Transport for Wales (TfW) operates a regular service on the Merthyr Line from to and .

A new railway station will be built by 2024 as part of the South Wales Metro upgrades to the area. The provision of a new gateway railway station building at Merthyr Tydfil is a key strategic aspiration of the new emerging Town Centre Masterplan, providing a significant regeneration impact within the Borough, increasing connectivity and accessibility to the wider region. New overhead lines have been installed to the Merthyr tracks, powering new tram-trains. These will reduce journey times between Merthyr Tydfil and Cardiff city centre and allow TfW to increase the frequency of services to four every hour.

===Buses===
Merthyr Tydfil bus station is located in Swan Street, to the south of the town centre. It opened in June 2021, replacing a previous one in Castle Street. Its new location is closer to the railway station to facilitate interchange as part of the South Wales Metro network.

Stagecoach South Wales operates services in the area, with routes connecting Merthyr to Aberdare, Brecon, Bridgend, Cardiff, Newport and Porthcawl.

===Roads===
Road improvements mean the town is increasingly a commuter location and has shown some of the highest house-price growth in the UK.

==Employment==
Merthyr relies on a combination of public sector, manufacturing and service sector companies to provide employment. The Welsh Government has recently opened a major office in the town near a large telecommunications call centre (T-Mobile and EE, now part of BT Group). Hoover (now part of Candy Group) has its registered office in the town and remained a major employer until it transferred production abroad in March 2009, with a loss of 337 jobs from the closure of its factory.

==Sport and leisure==
===Boxing===

Merthyr is well known for boxers, amateur and professional. The latter have included Johnny Owen, Howard Winstone, and Eddie Thomas. A series of bronze sculptures in the town mark their achievements.

The site of the sculpture of Eddie Thomas was also the location of the Bethesda Community Arts Centre in the 1980s.

Merthyr has a football team, Merthyr Town or &quot;The Martyrs&quot;, currently competes in the Southern Football League Premier South division in the English football pyramid. The team plays its home games at Penydarren Park.

The town was home to the professional Football League club Merthyr Town F.C. (1909), which folded in the 1930s; Merthyr Tydfil AFC was founded in 1945. In 1987, it won the Welsh Cup and qualified for the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The year 2008 marked the centennial of football at Penydarren Park. After going into liquidation in 2010, the club dropped down three divisions, reverted to the name of &quot;Merthyr Town&quot; and made Rhiw Dda&#x27;r its new home ground. After promotion, the club moved back to Penydarren Park in July 2011.

<doc id="351131" wikidata="Q1330734" url="?curid=351131" title="Virtual file system">
<text>A virtual file system (VFS) or virtual filesystem switch is an abstract layer on top of a more concrete file system. The purpose of a VFS is to allow client applications to access different types of concrete file systems in a uniform way. A VFS can, for example, be used to access local and network storage devices transparently without the client application noticing the difference. It can be used to bridge the differences in Windows, classic Mac OS/macOS and Unix filesystems, so that applications can access files on local file systems of those types without having to know what type of file system they are accessing.

A VFS specifies an interface (or a &quot;contract&quot;) between the kernel and a concrete file system. Therefore, it is easy to add support for new file system types to the kernel simply by fulfilling the contract. The terms of the contract might change incompatibly from release to release, which would require that concrete file system support be recompiled, and possibly modified before recompilation, to allow it to work with a new release of the operating system; or the supplier of the operating system might make only backward-compatible changes to the contract, so that concrete file system support built for a given release of the operating system would work with future versions of the operating system.

==Implementations==
One of the first virtual file system mechanisms on Unix-like systems was introduced by Sun Microsystems in SunOS 2.0 in 1985. It allowed Unix system calls to access local UFS file systems and remote NFS file systems transparently. For this reason, Unix vendors who licensed the NFS code from Sun often copied the design of Sun&#x27;s VFS. Other file systems could be plugged into it also: there was an implementation of the MS-DOS FAT file system developed at Sun that plugged into the SunOS VFS, although it wasn&#x27;t shipped as a product until SunOS 4.1. The SunOS implementation was the basis of the VFS mechanism in System V Release 4.

John Heidemann developed a &quot;stacking&quot; VFS under SunOS 4.0 for the experimental Ficus file system. This design provided for code reuse among file system types with differing but similar semantics (&quot;e.g.&quot;, an encrypting file system could reuse all of the naming and storage-management code of a non-encrypting file system). Heidemann adapted this work for use in 4.4BSD as a part of his thesis research; descendants of this code underpin the file system implementations in modern BSD derivatives including macOS.

Other Unix virtual file systems include the File System Switch in System V Release 3, the Generic File System in Ultrix, and the VFS in Linux. In OS/2 and Microsoft Windows, the virtual file system mechanism is called the Installable File System.

The Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) mechanism allows userland code to plug into the virtual file system mechanism in Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenSolaris, and macOS.

In Microsoft Windows, virtual filesystems can also be implemented through userland Shell namespace extensions; however, they do not support the lowest-level file system access application programming interfaces in Windows, so not all applications will be able to access file systems that are implemented as namespace extensions. KIO and GVfs/GIO provide similar mechanisms in the KDE and GNOME desktop environments (respectively), with similar limitations, although they can be made to use FUSE techniques and therefore integrate smoothly into the system.

==Single-file virtual file systems==
Sometimes Virtual File System refers to a file or a group of files (not necessarily inside a concrete file system) that acts as a manageable container which should provide the functionality of a concrete file system through the usage of software. Examples of such containers are CBFS Storage or a single-file virtual file system in an emulator like PCTask or so-called WinUAE, Oracle&#x27;s VirtualBox, Microsoft&#x27;s Virtual PC, VMware.

The primary benefit for this type of file system is that it is centralized and easy to remove. A single-file virtual file system may include all the basic features expected of any file system (virtual or otherwise), but access to the internal structure of these file systems is often limited to programs specifically written to make use of the single-file virtual file system (instead of implementation through a driver allowing universal access). Another major drawback is that performance is relatively low when compared to other virtual file systems. Low performance is mostly due to the cost of shuffling virtual files when data is written or deleted from the virtual file system.

===Implementation of single-file virtual filesystems===
Direct examples of single-file virtual file systems include emulators, such as PCTask and WinUAE, which encapsulate not only the filesystem data but also emulated disk layout. This makes it easy to treat an OS installation like any other piece of software—transferring it with removable media or over the network.

====PCTask====
The Amiga emulator PCTask emulated an Intel PC 8088 based machine clocked at 4.77MHz (and later an 80486SX clocked at 25 MHz). Users of PCTask could create a file of large size on the Amiga filesystem, and this file would be virtually accessed from the emulator as if it were a real PC Hard Disk. The file could be formatted with the FAT16 filesystem to store normal MS-DOS or Windows files.

====WinUAE====
The UAE for Windows, WinUAE, allows for large single files on Windows to be treated as Amiga file systems. In WinUAE this file is called a &quot;hardfile&quot;.

UAE could also treat a directory on the host filesystem (Windows, Linux, macOS, AmigaOS) as an Amiga filesystem.

<doc id="351132" wikidata="Q1193117" url="?curid=351132" title="T-Mobile Park">
<text>T-Mobile Park is a retractable roof ballpark in Seattle, Washington, United States. It is the home stadium of the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball and has a seating capacity of 47,929. It is in Seattle&#x27;s SoDo neighborhood, near the western terminus of Interstate 90 and is owned and operated by the Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium Public Facilities District. The first game at the stadium was played on July 15, 1999.

During the 1990s, the suitability of the Mariners&#x27; original stadium—the Kingdome—as an MLB facility came under question, and the team&#x27;s ownership group threatened to relocate the team. In September 1995, King County voters defeated a ballot measure to secure public funding for a new baseball stadium. Shortly thereafter, the Mariners&#x27; first appearance in the MLB postseason and their victory in the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) revived public desire to keep the team in Seattle. As a result, the Washington State Legislature approved an alternate means of funding for the stadium with public money. The site, just south of the Kingdome, was selected in September 1996 and construction began in March 1997. The bonds issued to finance the stadium were retired on October 1, 2011, five years earlier than anticipated.

T-Mobile Park is also used for amateur baseball events, including the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association high school state championships and one Washington Huskies game per season. Major non-baseball events that have been held at T-Mobile Park include the 2001 Seattle Bowl and WrestleMania XIX in 2003, which attracted the stadium&#x27;s record attendance of 54,097.

The stadium was originally named Safeco Field under a 20-year naming-rights deal with Seattle-based Safeco Insurance. T-Mobile acquired the naming rights on December 19, 2018, and the name change took effect on January 1, 2019.

==Location and transportation==
T-Mobile Park is in the SoDo district of downtown Seattle, bounded by Dave Niehaus Way (a block of 1st Avenue S.) to the west, Edgar Martínez Drive (formerly S. Atlantic Street) to the south, Royal Brougham Way to the north, and BNSF railroad tracks to the east.

Parking is available at the stadium&#x27;s parking garage across Edgar Martínez Drive, the Lumen Field garage to the North, and other privately operated lots in the area. Sounder commuter rail serves nearby King Street Station. T-Mobile Park is also served by the 1 Line of Sound Transit&#x27;s Link light rail system and local King County Metro and Sound Transit Express bus routes at the nearby Stadium station.

A dedicated ride-hailing lot opened in June 2023 along 3rd Avenue; it cost $2.8 million to construct and opened ahead of the 2023 MLB All-Star Game.

==History==
On March 30, 1994, county executive Gary Locke appointed a task force to assess the need for a new baseball stadium to replace the rapidly deteriorating Kingdome. Many feared that the Mariners would leave Seattle if a new stadium was not built. In January 1995, the 28-member task force recommended to the King County Council that the public should be involved in financing the stadium. The task force concluded that a sales tax increase of 0.1% (to 8.3%) would be sufficient to fund the stadium. King County held a special election on September 19, asking the public for this sales tax increase; the measure led early, but was narrowly defeated by one-fifth of one percent.

On October 14, a special session of the state legislature authorized a different funding package for a new stadium that included a food and beverage tax in King County restaurants and bars, car rental surcharge in King County, a ballpark admissions tax, a credit against the state sales tax, and sale of a special stadium license plate. Nine days later, the King County Council approved the funding package, and established the Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium Public Facilities District to own the ballpark and oversee design and construction. Taxpayer suits opposing the legislative actions and the taxes failed in the courts.

Initial concepts for the new stadium, developed under the working name of New Century Park, were unveiled by architecture firm HOK in March 1995. The design included a retractable roof split into four sections and a seating capacity of 45,000 seats on four levels. On September 9, 1996, the site was selected for the new stadium, just south of the Kingdome. In late fall, several members of the King County Council wrote a letter to the Seattle Mariners, requesting a postponement of the projected $384.5-million stadium project.
Construction officially began in 1997, with a groundbreaking ceremony on March 8 featuring Mariners star Ken Griffey Jr. The construction, overseen by chief financial officer (and former team president and minority owner) Kevin Mather, continued through the beginning of the 1999 season. Its first game was on July 15, immediately after the All-Star break; the Mariners lost 3–2 to the San Diego Padres with 44,607 in attendance. Longtime team broadcaster Dave Niehaus threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the game to Tom Foley, the former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

The naming rights were sold in June 1998 to Seattle-based Safeco Insurance, which paid $40 million for a 20-year deal. The 2018 season was the last played under this name, and the Safeco signage was removed from the ballpark beginning that November. The naming rights were awarded to T-Mobile, whose U.S. headquarters are based in nearby Bellevue on December 19, which paid $87.5 million for an agreement that will last 25 years, and the name change officially took effect on January 1, 2019.

Ken Griffey Jr. returned to Safeco Field in 2007 with the Cincinnati Reds (where he had been traded after the 1999 season) to a hero&#x27;s welcome. In commemoration of Griffey&#x27;s achievements with the team, the Mariners unveiled a new poster that declared Safeco Field &quot;The House That Griffey Built.&quot;

The Mariners moved the fences at Safeco Field closer to home plate before the 2013 season &quot;to create an environment that is fair for both hitters and pitchers,&quot; according to General Manager Jack Zduriencik. Safeco Field had been considered one of the most pitcher-friendly ballparks in the majors since it opened. The center field scoreboard and ad panels were replaced with an board during renovations, becoming the largest among all stadium scoreboards in the major leagues at the time.

After the 2017 season, the field surface, in place since the stadium opened in 1999, underwent its first full replacement. The infield and foul territory were redone in 2012, but the outfield had not been replaced before the resodding.

On January 1, 2024, the National Hockey League (NHL) hosted the 2024 NHL Winter Classic, where the Seattle Kraken won over the Vegas Golden Knights 3–0.

==Features==

There previously was technology that allowed spectators to monitor special game-time features with Nintendo DS receivers.

===Layout===
There are five main levels to the stadium: Field (or Street), Main Concourse (100 level – 20,634 seats), Club Level (200 level – 4,585 seats), Suite Level (1,945 seats), and Upper Concourse (300 level – 15,955 seats). Two bleacher sections are above left field and below the center field scoreboard, with 3,706 seats. The Broadcast Center (press box) is on the Club Level and sub-level between it and the Main Level. As the field is approximately at street level, entry into any of the main gates requires visitors to ascend a flight of stairs, escalator, or elevator to access the main concourse, with the exception of the Right Field Entry, which opens onto the main concourse. Stairs, escalators, elevators, and ramps around the park provide access to all levels.

===Seating capacity===
===Food service===

T-Mobile Park offers greater food and beverage selection than typical ballpark. It includes concession stands operated by chain as well as local restaurants, such as Ivar&#x27;s, Kidd Valley, Salt &amp; Straw, and Din Tai Fung. Patrons could previously order food with a Nintendo DS app called &quot;Nintendo Fan Network&quot;. The ballpark debuted &quot;Walk-Off Market&quot;, the first cashierless store in an MLB stadium, in May 2022 using technology supplied by Amazon. Three additional locations the following season and include grab-and-go food and beverages.

===Retractable roof===
In the open position, the roof rests over the BNSF Railway tracks that bound the stadium to the east, with part of it hanging over the stands in right field. This has the effect of echoing the whistles from passing trains into the stadium. Train horns were often heard inside the stadium throughout the 2000s, but abated significantly when an overpass was built for Royal Brougham Way, the street that bounds the stadium to the north which previously crossed the tracks. Unlike other stadiums with retractable roofs, the roof at T-Mobile Park does not fully enclose the ballpark; this allows the wind and temperatures to still impact the game with the roof closed.

The roof covers approximately and weighs . It moves with 128 wheels that move along rails on the north and south side of the ballpark. The top of the roof is above field level, while the bottom is high. The roof takes 10 to 20 minutes to open and is moved 300 to 500 times per year, mostly to manage the stadium&#x27;s grass. The Mariners play an average of 17 to 18 games per season with the roof closed, the least among MLB ballparks with retractable roofs. From 1999 to 2020, the roof had been used for 367 games—22 percent of those played at the stadium—with a maximum of 25 games during the 2010 season. The Mariners had a 692–632 record in games with the roof open, 116–109 with it closed, and 76–66 in games where the roof moves.

===Scoreboards===
T-Mobile Park features a manual scoreboard, the second-largest HD video display scoreboard in MLB, a color LED out-of-town scoreboard, and LED ribbon boards along the terraces. The main scoreboard, which replaced the original monochrome scoreboard and separate video screen above the center field bleachers before the 2013 season, is more than in area. The board can be used either all at once, such as for live action or video replays, or split into sections for displaying information such as statistics and advertisements.

===Mariners Hall of Fame===

Co-located with the Baseball Museum of the Pacific Northwest, the Mariners Hall of Fame features bronze plaques of the eleven inducted members: Alvin Davis (1997), Broadcaster Dave Niehaus (2000), Jay Buhner (2004), Edgar Martínez (2007), Randy Johnson (2012), Dan Wilson (2012), Ken Griffey Jr. (2013), Lou Pinella (2014), Jamie Moyer (2015), Ichiro Suzuki (2022), and Félix Hernández (2023). The plaques describe their contributions to the franchise, as well as murals and television screens showing highlights of their careers with the Mariners.

===The &#x27;Pen===
The &#x27;Pen, known for sponsorship purposes as &quot;The T-Mobile &#x27;Pen&quot;, is a standing-room only area adjacent to the bullpens, where spectators can watch relief pitchers warm up before entering the game.

When the stadium opened during the 1999 season, the area was called the &quot;Bullpen Market&quot;. In 2013, the Mariners&#x27; vice president of ballpark operations described the Bullpen Market as a dark and unwelcoming place that needed a remodel to be more attractive to fans.

Prior to the 2011 season, the Mariners brought in three celebrity chefs to introduce special concession stands with exclusive food options. In the first season under its new branding, per-capita fan spending in The &#x27;Pen increased by 87% from the previous season. In 2013, Edgar&#x27;s Cantina, named for Hall of Fame Mariners player Edgar Martínez, opened. &quot;Sports Business Journal&quot; called The &#x27;Pen &quot;one of the liveliest social scenes in Major League Baseball&quot; in 2013, when fan spending in The &#x27;Pen had risen 42% year over year, which a team spokeswoman credited primarily to Edgar&#x27;s Cantina.

Local Mexican restaurant Poquitos opened a stand in The &#x27;Pen during the 2017 season, and quickly gained national fame for selling chapulines, toasted grasshoppers, at every game. Poquitos sold over 900 orders of chapulines at the first three home games, at $4.00 for a cup.

In 2019, the Mariners opened The &#x27;Pen two and a half hours before the first pitch of Mariners home games, offering happy hour specials to encourage fans to arrive early. As many as 3,000 fans come to The &#x27;Pen during each game.

The &#x27;Pen attracts large and often rowdy crowds due to its food and drink options. On April 13, 2013, a man was injured and required reconstructive surgery after a fight broke out over a table in The &#x27;Pen. Two men turned themselves in, one of whom faced a felony assault charge. A team spokesperson said that the Mariners assign more uniformed police officers, private security guards, and alcohol enforcement officials to The &#x27;Pen during special events, such as College Night.

T-Mobile Park and its adjoining parking garage feature extensive public art displays, including:

* &quot;The Tempest&quot;, a chandelier made of 1,000 resin baseball bats above the home plate entry. A companion 27-foot diameter compass rose mosaic at the home plate rotunda captures a number of elements in the history of baseball. It was created by Linda Beaumont, Stuart Keeler, and Michael Machnic.
* &quot;Quilts&quot; depicting each MLB team logo, made from recycled metal including license plates from the respective teams&#x27; states (or the province of Ontario in the case of the Toronto Blue Jays, or the District of Columbia in the case of the Washington Nationals). The collection also includes references to the history of baseball in the Pacific Northwest.
* Stainless steel cutouts of players in various poses while catching, batting, fielding, and pitching, integrated into the fences at the stadium&#x27;s four main gates.
* &quot;Six Pitches&quot;, a series of metal sculptures depicting hands gripping baseballs for various types of pitches along the west facade of the garage.
* A bronze baseball glove, &quot;The Mitt&quot; by Gerard Tsutakawa, that has become an icon for T-Mobile Park.
* &quot;The Defining Moment&quot;, a mural by Thom Ross depicting Edgar Martínez&#x27;s famed &quot;The Double&quot;.
* Children&#x27;s Hospital Wishing Well, which features a bronze statue of a child in batting position, and includes a geyser effect that was used at the end of the national anthem.
* Porcelain enamel on steel flag-mounted banner-panels depicting &quot;Positions of the Field&quot;.

===Statues===
A bronze statue of Mariners broadcaster Dave Niehaus (1935–2010) was unveiled on September 16, 2011. The statue captures the broadcaster honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick Award in 2008, and who broadcast 5,284 Mariners games over 34 seasons (1977–2010), at a desk, behind a microphone, wearing headphones with his Mariners scorebook in front of him. His scorebook is opened to the box score for Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series, when Edgar Martínez hit &quot;The Double&quot;. There is an empty seat next to the statue, so fans can sit next to Niehaus and pose for photos. His longtime broadcast partner Rick Rizzs presided over a private ceremony to unveil the statue. The Dave Niehaus Broadcast Center is on the Club Level behind home plate. When Niehaus died, his headset and microphone were placed by his empty seat in the Broadcast Center as a tribute.

In April 2017, a statue of Ken Griffey Jr. by sculptor Lou Cella was unveiled outside the Home Plate Entrance to the ballpark. After the 2017 season, the bat was broken off in an attempt to steal it, but a bystander from the office building across the street ran down the perpetrator and recovered the bat, which was subsequently reattached.

A bronze statue of Martínez, also made by Cella, was installed in August 2021 on the south side of the stadium near Griffey&#x27;s statue.

==Notable events==
===Major League Baseball===
On April 21, 2012, Chicago White Sox pitcher Philip Humber pitched the 21st perfect game in Major League Baseball history against the Mariners in his second start of the season. It was the 3rd perfect game in White Sox history joining Charlie Robertson in 1922 and Mark Buehrle in 2009.

Nearly 4 months later on August 15, 2012, Mariners pitcher Félix Hernández pitched the 23rd perfect game in Major League Baseball history and the first perfect game in Mariners history. This marked the second perfect game and third no-hitter at the park, all of which occurred in the 2012 season.

The stadium has hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game twice: in 2001 as Safeco Field and 2023 as T-Mobile Park. The 2001 edition was won by the American League—featuring eight players from the Mariners—in front of 47,364 spectators. The 2023 edition was won by the National League with 47,159 in attendance. The event used nearby Lumen Field for several events, including a fan festival and the MLB player draft.

===Minor league baseball===

The stadium has been temporarily used by local minor league teams for playoff games when their normal venues were unavailable. The Tacoma Rainiers played their 2010 Pacific Coast League playoff semifinal games at then-Safeco Field while Cheney Stadium underwent off-season renovations. The Rainiers won their series and advanced to the PCL Championship, which was played entirely on the road due to Safeco Field being unavailable.

The Everett AquaSox of the Class A Northwest League played one game in the 2016 playoffs against the Spokane Indians at Safeco Field. The move was arranged after a rainstorm rendered the outfield at Everett Memorial Stadium unusable for several days.

===College baseball===
On May 4, 2007, an NCAA Pacific-10 Conference baseball attendance record was set when the Washington Huskies hosted defending National Champion Oregon State in front of 10,421 spectators. Washington won the game, 6–2.

===College football===
The stadium hosted the 2001 Seattle Bowl, the first edition of the short-lived Seattle Bowl college football game, on December 27, 2001. Georgia Tech defeated 11th-ranked Stanford, 24–14, before 30,144 fans.

===Soccer===
The stadium hosted several soccer matches before the opening of Lumen Field, which was designed for soccer. To prepare for soccer matches, the field has to be sodded to cover and replace the dirt infield.

On March 2, 2002, the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team played Honduras in a friendly match, winning 4–0 in front of a then-record crowd of 38,534. The stadium hosted four matches during the 2002 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s Gold Cup in November, including two matches featuring the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team, as part of qualification for the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. The first U.S. match, against Panama, had an attendance of 21,522; the second match, against Costa Rica, was attended by 10,079 fans.

Seattle Sounders FC, a Major League Soccer team that plays at adjacent Lumen Field, once drafted plans to play a 2018 CONCACAF Champions League match at then-Safeco Field due to a potential scheduling conflict.

===Wrestling===
On March 30, 2003, the stadium hosted WrestleMania XIX, which set an all-time record attendance for the facility of 54,097.

===Ice hockey===

The 2024 NHL Winter Classic on January 1 was held at T-Mobile Park and was contested by the Seattle Kraken and the Vegas Golden Knights. The Kraken won 3–0 in front of 47,313 spectators.

===Concerts===
===Other===
* The stadium was the home to the Microsoft annual employee meeting until 2012, attracting over 20,000 employees.
*Bernie Sanders held a rally for his 2016 presidential campaign on March 25.
* The stadium hosted Nitro Circus Live on September 16, 2017.
* On September 15, 2018, Russell M. Nelson, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, along with his wife, Wendy Watson Nelson, and Second Counselor Henry B. Eyring, held a devotional that was attended by 49,089 church members, friends, and members of the community.
*Several local high schools and universities have held graduation ceremonies at the stadium. Issaquah High School&#x27;s class of 2000 was the first to graduate at the stadium.

<text>Pyeonghwa Motors (Hangul : 평화자동차; Hancha : 平和自動車 – a Korean language word for &quot;peace&quot;), also spelled Pyonghwa, is one of the two car manufacturers and dealers in the North Korean automotive industry, alongside Sungri Motor Plant. Until 2013, it was a joint venture in Nampo between Pyonghwa Motors of Seoul (South Korea), a company owned by Sun Myung Moon&#x27;s Unification Church, and the North Korean Ryonbong General Corp. The joint venture produced small cars under licence from Fiat and Brilliance China Auto, a pickup truck and an SUV using complete knock down kits from Chinese manufacturer Dandong Shuguang, and a luxury car of SsangYong design. From 2013, the company has been fully owned by the North Korean state.

Erik van Ingen Schenau, author of the book &quot;Automobiles Made in North Korea&quot;, has estimated the company&#x27;s total production in 2005 at not more than around 400 units.

==History==
Pyeonghwa Motors was officially founded by the Unification Church. The venture came during the period of the Sunshine Policy between North and South Korea, when sanctions on the country were not as tough. The venture was announced in 2000.

In 2002, around $55 million was set aside to build the factory, with which the first production line in Nampo was completed and the first Hwiparam was produced. The Premio and Pronto were later introduced in 2004.

In 2009, PM earned about $700,000 from the sale of 650 cars, with $500,000 remitted to South Korea. Park Sang-Kwon, Pyeonghwa Motors president, started talks to end investment in 2012.

The Unification Church officially transferred all investment to Pyongyang in 2013.

==Production==
Pyeonghwa has the exclusive rights to car production, purchase, and sale of used cars in North Korea. However, most North Koreans are unable to afford a car. Because of the very small market for cars in the country, Pyeonghwa&#x27;s output is reportedly very low: in 2003, only 314 cars were produced even though the factory had the facilities to produce up to 10,000 cars a year.

==Model list==

* &quot;Hwiparam&quot; I, 2000, based on the Fiat Siena.
* &quot;Hwiparam&quot; II, 2007, based on the Brilliance Junjie/BS4/M2.
* &quot;Hwiparam&quot; III, 2010, based on the Brilliance FSV.
* &quot;Bbeokgugi (Peokkugi)&quot; 1, 2003, based on the Fiat Doblò. Known to keep the Fiat vehicle badge.
* &quot;Bbeokgugi (Peokkugi)&quot; 2, 2004, based on the Shuguang SUV 4x2.
* &quot;Bbeokgugi (Peokkugi)&quot; 3, 2004, based on the Shuguang Huanghai.
* &quot;Bbeokgugi (Peokkugi)&quot; 4, 2005, based on the Shuguang Dawn.
* &quot;Junma&quot;(Zunma), 2005, based on the SsangYong Chairman.
* &quot;Junma&quot; (Zunma 1606), 2013, based on the FAW-Volkswagen Sagitar.
* &quot;Junma&quot; (Zunma 2008), 2013, based on the FAW-Volkswagen Magotan
* &quot;Samcheonri&quot;, 2005, based on the Jinbei Haise.

===Further models and partnerships===
In summer 2006, the North Korean government magazine &quot;Foreign Trade&quot;, which advertises North Korean products, published a photograph of a new luxury car produced by Pyeonghwa, the Junma, which appears to be a rebadged version of the South Korean SsangYong Chairman.

The Junma bears a strong resemblance to SsangYong cars, specifically the Chairman, which are favored by North Korean government officials. The Chairman is based on an old Mercedes E-Class design.

In 2006, Pyeonghwa reached an agreement with Chinese manufacturer Brilliance China Auto to assemble its Jinbei Haise vans, which are based on an old version of the Toyota HiAce.

In 2007, Pyeonghwa introduced Brilliance&#x27;s Junjie car under the name Hwiparam II. The original Fiat-based Hwiparam has appeared on Pyeonghwa&#x27;s web site.

In 2009, Pyeonghwa announced a profit on its North Korean operations.

The Premio and Pronto are also sold in Vietnam by Mekong Auto. Both are based on Huanghai vehicles. Mekong Auto has sold Fiat cars in Vietnam since 1995, and this relationship may have led to Pyeonghwa assembling Fiats in North Korea.

==Advertising==
Pyeonghwa is currently the only company in North Korea to advertise. A series of billboards and TV commercials have been made in an effort to show residents that their country is able to produce products such as motor vehicles. The ads may be aimed primarily at expatriate businessmen in Pyongyang, but &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine suggests that they are actually propaganda aimed at the local population, to make them believe that their country is economically successful.

<doc id="351138" wikidata="Q5566550" url="?curid=351138" title="Glamorganshire Canal">
<text>The Glamorganshire Canal () in South Wales, UK, was begun in 1790. It ran along the valley of the River Taff from Merthyr Tydfil to the Bristol Channel at Cardiff. The final section of canal was closed in 1951.

== History ==

Construction started in 1790; being watched over by the wealthy ironmasters of Merthyr Tydfil, including Richard Crawshay of the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, the canal was thought up as a solution to the issue of transporting the goods (iron ore, coal and limestone) from the valleys to Cardiff, where they would be shipped around the world. Thomas Dadford was hired to inspect and plan a route for the canal and, with support from Lord Cardiff, the canal was authorised by an act of Parliament, the (30 Geo. 3. c. 82) on 9 June 1790.

Almost £90,000 was raised in preparation of constructing the canal and would be linked to any works within four miles of the canal, through branch canals and linking railways. However, during the few miles approaching Cardiff, the canal suffered from severe water shortages, resulting in goods not arriving in Cardiff on time. To solve this problem, the Melingriffith Water Pump was installed, with the main purpose being to provide water to the canal from the River Taff. Located not far from the Melingriffith Tinplate works located directly between the River Taff and the Glamorganshire Canal, it was built in 1807, but the origins of the water pump are disputed; historians believe it was designed by either Watkin George of Cyfarthfa Ironworks (1793), or John Rennie (1795).

===Construction===
The &quot;Company of Proprietors of the Glamorganshire Canal Navigation&quot; was authorised to raise £60,000 in capital to build the main canal, with a further £30,000 if necessary, together with branch canals as required, and feeder railways linking the canal to any works within of its course. These railways were deemed to be part of the canal itself, and so land for their routes could be obtained by compulsory purchase if required. Construction began in August 1790, when Thomas Dadford, a pupil of the canal engineer James Brindley, arrived on site, with Thomas Sheasby, his son Thomas Dadford, Jr., and a team of workmen. Construction started from the Merthyr Tydfil end. An extension from Merthyr to Crawshay&#x27;s Cyfarthfa Ironworks was also built, although payment for it resulted in a dispute which was eventually resolved by arbitration. A plan to build a branch to the Dowlais and Penydarren Ironworks, which would have risen in only was dropped, and was replaced by two tramroads, one from each works.

The Merthyr to Newbridge (later renamed Pontypridd) section was completed by June 1792, and the rest of the canal was progressively opened to Pwllywhyad (Treforest) in January 1793 and Taff&#x27;s Well by June 1793. By this time the project was well over budget, and although the final section to Cardiff was opened on 10 February 1794, it was not well constructed, and there were several stoppages for repairs during 1794. The canal breached in December, but Dadford refused to start repairs without payment, despite the terms of his contract, and promptly dismissed his workforce and walked away from the job. The canal company attempted to recover £17,000 from the Dadfords, and had them arrested, but two independent surveyors employed by the engineer Robert Whitworth judged largely in the Dadfords&#x27; favour, and only £1,512 was refunded.

The canal followed the Queen Street Tunnel in central Cardiff, which crossed Queen Street opposite The Friary, and under what is now the St David&#x27;s shopping centre. The tunnel was long and wide. It had a towpath for long and had chains for the boatmen to pull by hand for the remainder of the tunnel.

The canal was around long with a drop of around , requiring 50 locks. It clung to the western side of the valley down to Navigation (now called Abercynon) where it crossed the River Taff on an aqueduct, to cling to the eastern side for most of its route to Cardiff. A second act of Parliament, the Glamorganshire Canal Act 1796 (36 Geo. 3. c. 69), was obtained on 26 April 1796, which enabled the canal to be extended by half a mile (0.8 km), ending in a sea lock in Cardiff docks. This was opened in June 1798 when the event was celebrated by a naval procession and the firing of ships&#x27; guns The total cost of the canal was £103,600, which included the costs of buying the land, as well as the contract with the Dadfords.

Although the Dadfords left the canal under a shadow, their work was vindicated by Whitworth, and they went on to build other canals in neighbouring valleys, while their achievement was summed up by John Bird in 1796: &quot;The canal is brought through mountainous scenery with wonderful ingenuity&quot;.

===Operation===
Richard Crawshay was the principal shareholder in the canal company, and seems to have used his influence to his own advantage, treating the canal as his own. His attempts to squeeze the profits of the other ironmasters led to them proposing a Tramroad from Merthyr to Cardiff, to compete with the canal. Crawshay resisted this, and the canal tolls were reduced somewhat, but the ironmasters on the east side of the Taff Valley soon built the Merthyr Tramroad, which opened in 1802 and linked their iron works to the canal at Abercynon, near the River Taff aqueduct.

Water for the top of the canal was obtained from the tail races from Cyfarthfa ironworks, which had previously been fed back into the River Taff, so that it could be reused by the Plymouth ironworks. In order to safeguard this supply, all water discharged from the third lock was supposed to be fed into the Plymouth feeder, rather than the canal below it. This was a source of dispute for some years, with legal action instituted by both sides and the occasional bout of vandalism to ensure water actually flowed to the Plymouth works. The situation was eased with the opening of the Merthyr Tramroad, as there was less traffic on the upper section, and therefore less water used by the locks.

The canal was profitable for many years. Dividends were limited to eight per cent by the authorising act of Parliament, and so between 1804 and 1828 the profits were used to give refunds to the traders, periods when no tolls were charged, and others when they were reduced to one quarter of the rate fixed by the act. From 1841 railways began to encroach onto the canal&#x27;s territory, when the Taff Vale Railway opened to Merthyr. The canal held its own for another twenty years, but in the 1870s the ironworks started to close, while some moved to the manufacture of steel.

The canal passed over the Bute Docks Feeder with a small aqueduct built in the late 1830s, at the north-east corner of Cardiff Castle. The feeder fed the Bute Docks, having extracted water from Blackweir on the River Taff. There was an overflow from the canal into the feeder.

1876 was the first year when the canal company was unable to pay the full eight per cent dividend, and profits fell rapidly after that. The canal was sold to the Marquess of Bute in 1885, who made some improvements at the Cardiff end, but six railway companies were serving Merthyr by 1886, all competing for traffic. The upper sections, particularly the pound at Aberfan, was suffering from severe subsidence as a result of the coal mining. An inspection was carried out, and the canal was closed from Merthyr to Abercynon on 6 December 1898, to safeguard the village of Aberfan.

===Decline and closure===
The takeover of the canal by the Marquess of Bute was a little too late to have any great effect. Improvements at Cardiff involved the construction of a new lock, Number 51, which raised the water level between there and Crockherbtown lock, so that the junction canal and the East and West Bute docks were all on the same level. The new lock was not included in the 1888 returns to the Board of Trade, and so must have been built after that date. Traffic on the rest of the canal continued to decline, and when a breach occurred at Cilfynydd in 1915, the company decided not to invest in its repair, but instead built a wooden flume around the breach, so that water from the Elen Deg feeder could still reach the rest of the canal. A further breach occurred on 25 May 1942, near Nantgarw and, although engineers examined the problem, no work was carried out.

Cardiff Corporation moved quickly, and agreed to buy the canal for £44,000. This proposal was enshrined in the Cardiff Corporation Act 1943 (6 &amp; 7 Geo. 6. c. xvi) of August 1943, allowing them to take control of the canal on 1 January 1944, and immediately declare it closed, most business having effectively ceased in 1942. However, section 27 of that act prevented them from closing the final mile above the sea lock, while it was used by sand traders. An attempt to evict the sand traders failed when the Ministry of War Transport invoked section 27 and ruled that the sea lock pound must be kept navigable until six months after the present emergency ended. The war emergency was not declared to have ended until 8 October 1950.

Meanwhile, the two sand and gravel firms continued to use the sea lock and the pound to carry on their business. However, the end came on the night of 5 December 1951, when a steam suction dredger, called &quot;Catherine Ethel&quot; and weighing 154 tons, crashed into the inner lock gates. The gates collapsed, and all of the water in the mile-long section (1.6 km) emptied into the estuary. The gates were never repaired and the difficult job of closing the canal was solved overnight for the Cardiff Corporation.

==Today==
Today, limited traces of the canal remain, about one half being covered by the A470 Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil trunk road, which was constructed in the 1970s. Much of the Taff Trail between Abercynon and Merthyr Tydfil follows the line of the canal. The section from Tongwynlais to the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works at Whitchurch has been retained in water and was used for fishing, but is now the Glamorganshire Canal local nature reserve. In addition, there are a few bridges and locks which have not been destroyed. There are also short stretches in water at Nightingales Bush and at Locks 31 and 32 in Pontypridd and there are plans for restoration here.

A boat weighing machine, one of only four known to have existed on British canals, was originally installed at Tongwynlais and was later moved to North Road, Cardiff. The machine was presented to the British Transport Commission in 1955 and was re-erected at the Stoke Bruerne Canal Museum in Northamptonshire in 1964. In 2013 it was moved to the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea.

<text>The pieds-noirs (; ; : &quot;pied-noir&quot;) are an ethno-cultural group of people of French and other European descent who were born in Algeria during the period of French colonial rule from 1830 to 1962. Many of them departed for mainland France during and after the war by which Algeria gained its independence in 1962.

From the French invasion on 18 June 1830 to its independence, Algeria was administratively part of France; its ethnic European population were simply called Algerians or &quot;colons&quot; (colonists). But the Muslim people of Algeria were called Arabs, Muslims or indigènes. The term &quot;pied-noir&quot; came into common use shortly before the end of the Algerian War in 1962.

As of the last census in French-ruled Algeria, taken on 1 June 1960, there were 1,050,000 non-Muslim civilians, some 10 per cent of the population. Most &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; were Catholic and of European descent, but their population included around 130,000 indigenous Algerian Jews who were granted French citizenship through the Crémieux Decree and were viewed as a part of the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; community.

During the Algerian War, a vast majority of &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; were loyalists and overwhelmingly supported colonial French rule in Algeria. They were opposed to Algerian nationalist groups such as the &quot;Front de libération nationale&quot; (English: National Liberation Front) (FLN) and &quot;Mouvement national algérien&quot; (English: Algerian National Movement) (MNA). The roots of the conflict lay in political and economic inequalities perceived as an &quot;alienation&quot; from the French rule as well as a demand for a leading position for the Berber, Arab and Islamic cultures and rules existing before the French conquest. The conflict contributed to the fall of the French Fourth Republic and the exodus of European and Jewish Algerians to France.

After Algeria became independent in 1962, about 800,000 &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; of French nationality evacuated to mainland France, while about 200,000 remained in Algeria. Of the latter, there were still about 100,000 in 1965, about 50,000 by the end of the 1960s and 30,000 in 1993. During the Algerian Civil War between 1992 and 2002, the population of &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; and others of European descent plummeted, as they were often targeted by Islamist rebel groups. The French consulate in Algiers recorded that around 300 persons of European descent remain in the country, whereas an Algerian census company recorded the number as higher. The &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; who have remained since independence are now overwhelmingly elderly.

Those who moved to France suffered ostracism from some left-wing political movements for their perceived exploitation of native Muslims, while others blamed them for the war and thus for the political turmoil surrounding the collapse of the Fourth Republic. In popular culture, the community is often represented as feeling removed from French culture while longing for Algeria. The recent history of the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; has been characterized by a sense of twofold alienation, on the one hand from the land of their birth and on the other from their adopted homeland. Though the term &quot;rapatriés d&#x27;Algérie&quot; implies that prior to Algeria they once lived in France, most &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; were born and raised in Algeria.

==Etymology==

There are competing theories about the origin of the term &quot;pied-noir&quot;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, it refers to &quot;a person of European origin living in Algeria during the period of French rule, especially a French person expatriated after Algeria was granted independence in 1962&quot;. The &quot;Le Robert&quot; dictionary states that in 1901 the word indicated a sailor working barefoot in the coal room of a ship, who would find his feet blackened by the soot and dust. Since in the Mediterranean this was often an Algerian native, the term was used pejoratively for Algerians until 1955, when it first began referring to &quot;French born in Algeria&quot; according to some sources. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; claims this usage originated from mainland French as a negative nickname.
There is also a theory that the term comes from the black boots worn by French soldiers compared to the barefoot Algerians. Other theories focus on new settlers dirtying their clothing by working in swampy areas, wearing black boots when on horseback, or trampling grapes to make wine.

==History==
French, along with Spanish, Italian and other European settlers, moved to France&#x27;s overseas colonies and territories. The largest group of one million settled in Algeria, followed by 200,000 in Morocco and proportionally fewer in other colonies. These settlers often took land that had been forcibly taken from the local population. While they had full political representation in Paris and the French government, the native population did not. Many settlers were fiercely committed to maintaining the overseas empire because they came from impoverished European backgrounds. Nearly half of the Algerian settlers in the 1880s were from Spain, southern Italy, or Malta, and the remainder were mostly poor French. They had nothing to return to if a local nationalist movement won its war of national liberation.

===French conquest and settlement===


European settlement of Algeria began during the 1830s, after France had commenced the process of conquest with the military seizure of the city of Algiers in 1830. The invasion was instigated when the Dey of Algiers struck the French consul with a fly-swatter in 1827, although economic reasons are also cited. In 1830 the government of King Charles X blockaded Algeria and an armada sailed to Algiers, followed by a land expedition. A troop of 34,000 soldiers landed on 18 June 1830, at Sidi Ferruch, west of Algiers. Following a three-week campaign, the Hussein Dey capitulated on 5 July 1830 and was exiled.

In the 1830s the French controlled only the northern part of the country. Entering the Oran region, they faced resistance from Emir Abd al-Kader, a leader of a Sufi Brotherhood. In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring jihad against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with Al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the military and the government in Paris. In response to the breaking of the second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In response, a French force of nearly 100,000 troops marched to the Algerian countryside and forced Abd al-Kader&#x27;s surrender in 1847.

In 1848 Algeria was divided into three departments (Alger, Oran and Constantine), thus becoming part of France.

The French modeled their colonial system on their predecessors, the Ottomans, by co-opting local tribes. In 1843 the colonists began supervising through &quot;bureaux arabes&quot; operated by military officials with authority over particular domains.

This system lasted until the 1880s and the rise of the French Third Republic, when colonisation intensified. Large-scale regrouping of lands began when land-speculation companies took advantage of government policy that allowed massive sales of native property. By the 20th century Europeans held 1,700,000 hectares; by 1940,  2,700,000 hectares, about 35 to 40 percent; and by 1962 it was 2,726,700 hectares representing 27 percent of the arable land of Algeria. Settlers came from all over the western Mediterranean region, particularly Italy, France, Spain and Malta.

===Identity===

In Metropolitan France, Algeria was considered an integral part of French national territory, and this sentiment was largely shared by the &quot;pied-noir&quot; community.

The end of the French protectorate of Tunisia and of the French protectorate in Morocco in 1956 led to mass emigration of French people from both states. These two countries had been placed under protectorate, whereas Algeria and its population fell under territory status and were considered part of overseas France.

After the French committed the Sétif and Guelma massacre (1945), with the French navy and air force shelling and bombing Algerian territory, Algerians increasingly began to look towards increased autonomy or outright independence. In 1954 the FLN launched its first operations and this marks the start of the Algerian war in 1954, Pierre Mendès France, President of the Council, addressing the French National Assembly expressed the distinction between the political status of Algeria compared to Tunisia and Morocco: The French government and military reacted with implementing a brutal torture regime inspired by the likes of French general Massu. The OAS started to increase murders and bombings against Algerians and French who opposed further French control of Algeria.

We do not compromise when it comes to defending the internal peace of the nation, the unity, the integrity of the Republic. The departments of Algeria constitute a part of the French Republic. They have been French for a long time and irrevocably. Their populations, who enjoy French citizenship and are represented in Parliament, have moreover given in peace, as before in war, enough proof of their attachment to France for France, in its turn, not to allow in question this unit. Between them and the metropolis, there is no conceivable secession. Never France, no government, no French Parliament, whatever their particular tendencies, will ever yield on this fundamental principle. I affirm that no comparison with Tunisia or Morocco is more false, more dangerous. Here it is France.&quot;

As the colony of Algeria grew with each generation, &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; began to define themselves as distinct from the French citizens of metropolitan France; they identified as Algerian people. Some &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; considered themselves at one time to be &quot;true Algerians&quot;, whereas they termed Muslim Algerians as &quot;Indigenous&quot; peoples. An exchange between a &quot;pied-noir&quot; student from Algiers and a metropolitan French student was recorded during a UNEF conference in 1922:

&quot;So you&#x27;re Algerian… but the son of a Frenchman, aren&#x27;t you?&quot;
&quot;Of course! All Algerians are sons of the French, the others are natives.&quot;

However, many &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; avoided using the term after the Second World War so as not to be confused with indigenous Algerian migrant workers who went to France. The &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; themselves also used several nicknames to designate the French in metropolitan France, such as &quot;French from France&quot;, &quot;Frangaoui&quot;, &quot;Patos&quot; and sometimes &quot;pied-blanc&quot; ().

Other terms used internally within the &quot;pied-noir&quot; population included &quot;pied-rouge&quot; () to refer to &quot;pied-noir&quot; members of the Algerian Communist Party or those who held left-wing beliefs, including a minority of &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; sympathetic to the independence movement. The term &quot;Pied-Gris&quot; was used to refer both to children with parentage from both metropolitan France and French Algeria, and to French settlers from independent Tunisia and Morocco who moved to French Algeria in the late 1950s rather than to France. French writer René Domergue noted that &quot;Pied-Gris&quot; was used by both French settlers from Tunisia and Morocco and the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; themselves to distinguish themselves from each other.

===Culture, food and language===
French writer Léon Isnard noted that &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; often mixed traditional French and occasionally Spanish and Italian cuisine with local Arab and Jewish influences. Dishes such as gazpacho, paella, &quot;méchoui&quot; and brochette skewered meat were commonly consumed by the &quot;pied-noir&quot; population and often accompanied with white wine produced by &quot;pied-noir&quot; farmers in Tlemcen and red wine from Mascara.

Although French was the main language of the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;, a distinct form of French known as &quot;pataouète&quot; developed in the &quot;pied-noir&quot; community in Algeria and contained words, idioms, expressions and slang terms not commonly found in Metropolitan France. Ferdinand Duchene noted that &quot;pataouète&quot; was largely derived from mainland French but contained words from Spanish and Catalan (influenced by Spanish workers in Algerian during the late 1800s), as well as Italian, and local Arab dialect.

===Social structure===
Like other white populations in colonial-era Africa, the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; generally dominated much of Algeria&#x27;s industrial, cultural and political institutions, comprising the most influential section of society. However, French Algeria also attracted laborers, blue collar and agricultural workers from metropolitan France, Spain, Italy and Malta in search of better economic opportunities. European manual laborers came under the &quot;pied-noir&quot; fold and acquired French nationality after several years of living in Algeria. As such, the &quot;pied-noir&quot; community contained different social classes and structures. Following the exodus to France in the aftermath of the Algerian war, working-class &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; were particularly scathing in response to accusations from the French political left that they were exploiters or elite colonialists over the indigenous population.

===Relationship to mainland France and Muslim Algeria===
The &quot;pied-noir&quot; relationship with France and Algeria was marked by alienation. The settlers considered themselves French, but many of the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; had a tenuous connection to mainland France; 28 percent of them had never visited there. The settlers encompassed a range of socioeconomic &quot;strata&quot;, ranging from peasants to large landowners, the latter of whom were referred to as &quot;grands colons&quot;.

In Algeria, the Muslims were not considered French and did not share the same political or economic benefits of the territory. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;) at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, they were required to renounce their Muslim identity – with only about 2,500 Muslims acquiring citizenship before 1930. The settlers&#x27; politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.

===The &quot;pied-noir&quot; population as part of the total Algerian population===

From roughly the last half of the 19th century until independence, the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; accounted for approximately 10% of the total Algerian population. Although they constituted a numerical minority, they were undoubtedly the prime political and economic force of the region.
In 1959, the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; numbered 1,025,000, and accounted for 10.4% of the total population of Algeria, a percentage gradually diminishing since the peak of 15.2% in 1926. However, some areas of Algeria had high concentrations of &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;, such as the regions of Bône (now Annaba), Algiers, and above all the area from Oran to Sidi-Bel-Abbès. Oran had been under European rule since the 16th century (1509); the population in the Oran metropolitan area was 49.3% European in 1959.
In the Algiers metropolitan area, Europeans accounted for 35.7% of the population. In the metropolitan area of Bône, they accounted for 40.5% of the population. The &quot;département&quot; of Oran, a rich European-developed agricultural land of 16,520 km2 (6,378 sq. miles) stretching between the cities of Oran and Sidi-Bel-Abbès, and including them, was the area of highest &quot;pied-noir&quot; density outside of the cities, with the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; accounting for 33.6% of the population of the &quot;département&quot; in 1959.

===Jewish community===

Jews were present in North Africa and Iberia for centuries, some since the time when &quot;Phoenicians and Hebrews, engaged in maritime commerce, founded Hippo Regius (current Annaba), Tipasa, Caesarea (current Cherchel), and Icosium (current Algiers)&quot;. According to oral tradition they arrived from Judea after the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 AD). It is known historically that many Sephardi Jews came following the Spanish &quot;Reconquista&quot;. Others came after Spain expelled Jews in 1492.

In 1870, Justice Minister Adolphe Crémieux wrote a proposal, &quot;décret Crémieux&quot;, to give French citizenship to most Algerian Jews. This advancement was resisted by part of the larger &quot;pied-noir&quot; community and in 1897 a wave of anti-Semitic riots occurred in Algeria. During World War II the &quot;décret Crémieux&quot; was abolished under the Vichy regime. Jews were barred from professional jobs between 1940 and 1943. Citizenship was restored in 1943, after the Free French took control over Algeria in the wake of Operation Torch. Thus, the Jews of Algeria eventually came to be considered part of the &quot;pied-noir&quot; community. Many fled the country to France in 1962, alongside most other &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;, after the Algerian War.

Mozabite Jews were excluded from the Crémieux Decree, and were only granted “common law civil status” and French citizenship in 1961.

==Algerian War and exodus==

===Algerian War===

For more than a century France maintained colonial rule in Algerian territory. This allowed exceptions to republican law, including Sharia laws applied by Islamic customary courts to Muslim women, which gave women certain rights to property and inheritance that they did not have under French law. Discontent among the Muslim Algerians grew after the World Wars, in which the Algerians sustained many casualties. Algerian nationalists began efforts aimed at furthering equality by listing complaints in the &quot;Manifesto of the Algerian People&quot;, which requested equal representation under the state and access to citizenship, but no equality for all citizens to preserve Islamic precepts. The French response was to grant citizenship to 60,000 &quot;meritorious&quot; Muslims.

During a reform effort in 1947, the French laws were changed to give the former French subjects with the legal status of &quot;indigenes&quot; full French legal citizenship. The French created an Algerian Assembly, a form of bicameral legislature, with limited powers, and two chambers, one for those who were French citizens before 1947, and another for all the others who had just become French citizens. Given the equal numbers of members in each chamber this meant that one group&#x27;s votes had seven times more weight than the other group&#x27;s. Paramilitary groups such as the National Liberation Front (&quot;Front de Libération nationale&quot;, FLN) appeared, claiming an Arab-Islamic brotherhood and state. This led to the outbreak of a war for independence, the Algerian War, in 1954.
From the first armed operations of November 1954, &quot;pied-noir&quot; civilians had always been targets for the FLN: they were assassinated in bombings of bars and cinemas; suffered mass massacres; and were tortured and sometimes raped on farms.
At the onset of the war, the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; believed the French military would be able to overcome opposition. In May 1958 a demonstration for French Algeria, led by &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;, occupied an Algerian government building. Plots to overthrow the Fourth Republic, some including metropolitan French politicians and generals, had been swirling in Algeria for some time. General Jacques Massu controlled the riot by forming a &#x27;Committee of Public Safety&#x27;, demanding that his acquaintance Charles de Gaulle be named president of the French Fourth Republic, to prevent the &quot;abandonment of Algeria&quot;. This eventually led to the fall of the Republic. In response, the French Parliament voted 329 to 224 to place de Gaulle in power.

Once de Gaulle assumed leadership, he attempted peace by visiting Algeria within three days of his appointment, proclaiming &quot;French Algeria!&quot;; but in September 1959 he planned a referendum for Algerian self-determination that passed overwhelmingly. Many French political and military leaders in Algeria viewed this as a betrayal and formed the &quot;Organisation armée secrète&quot; (OAS), which had much support among &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;. This paramilitary group began attacking officials representing de Gaulle&#x27;s authority, Muslims, and de Gaulle himself. The OAS was also accused of murders and bombings, which nullified any remaining reconciliation opportunities between the communities. The &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; had never believed such reconciliation possible as their community was targeted from the start.

The opposition culminated in the Algiers putsch of 1961, led by retired generals. After its failure, on 18 March 1962, de Gaulle and the FLN signed a cease-fire agreement, the Évian Accords, and held a referendum. In July, Algerians voted 5,975,581 to 16,534 to become independent from France.
On the morning of 5 July 1962, the day Algeria became independent, seven &quot;katibas&quot; (companies) of the FLN troops entered the city and were fired at by some Europeans. An outraged Arab mob swept to &quot;pied-noir&quot; neighborhoods, which had already been largely vacated, and attacked the remaining &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;. The violence lasted several hours and was ended by the deployment of the French Gendarmerie.

====Exodus====

The exodus began once it became clear that Algeria would become independent. In Algiers, it was reported that by May 1961 the morale had sunk among the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; because of violence and allegations that the entire community of French nationals had been responsible for &quot;terrorism, torture, colonial racism, and ongoing violence in general&quot; and because the group felt &quot;rejected by the nation as &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;&quot;. These factors, the Oran Massacre, and the referendum for independence caused the &quot;pied-noir&quot; exodus to begin in earnest.

The number of &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; who fled Algeria totalled more than 800,000 between 1962 and 1964. Many &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; left only with what they could carry in a suitcase. Adding to the confusion, the de Gaulle government ordered the French Navy not to help with transportation of French citizens. By September 1962, cities such as Oran, Bône, and Sidi Bel Abbès were half-empty. All administration-, police-, school-, justice-, and commercial activities stopped within three months after many &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; were told to choose either &quot;la valise ou le cercueil&quot; (the suitcase or the coffin). Some 200,000 &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; chose to remain, but they gradually left through the following decades; by the 1980s only a few thousand &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; remained in Algeria.

Along with the exodus of the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;, the Muslim harki auxiliaries, who had fought on the French side during the Algerian War, also tried to emigrate. But of approximately 250,000 Muslim loyalists only about 90,000, including dependents, were able to escape to France. Of those who remained, many thousands were killed by lynch mobs or executed as traitors by the FLN. In contrast to the treatment of the European &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;, little effort was made by the French government to extend protection to the harkis or to arrange their organised evacuation.

====Flight to mainland France====
The Government of France claimed that it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 might choose to depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to Algeria. The administration had set aside funds for absorption of those it called &quot;repatriates&quot; to partly reimburse them for property losses. The administration avoided acknowledging the true numbers of refugees to avoid upsetting its Algeria policies. Consequently, few plans were made for their return, and, psychologically at least, many of the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; were alienated from both Algeria and France.

Many &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; settled in continental France, while others migrated to New Caledonia, Australia, Spain, Israel, Argentina, In France, many relocated to the south, which offered a climate similar to North Africa. The influx of new citizens bolstered the local economies; however, the newcomers also competed for jobs, which caused resentment. One unintended consequence, with significant and ongoing political effects, was the resentment caused by the state resettlement programme for &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; in rural Corsica, which triggered a cultural and political nationalist movement. In some ways, the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; were able to integrate well into the French community, in particular relative to their harki Muslim counterparts. Their resettlement was made easier by the economic boom of the 1960s. However, the ease of assimilation depended on socioeconomic class.

Integration was easier for the upper classes, many of whom found the transformation less stressful than the lower classes, whose only capital had been left in Algeria when they fled. Many were surprised at often being treated as an &quot;underclass or outsider-group&quot; with difficulties in gaining advancement in their careers. Also, many &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; contended that the money allocated by the government to assist in relocation and reimbursement was insufficient regarding their losses.

Thus, the repatriated &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; frequently felt &quot;disaffected&quot; from French society. They also suffered from a sense of alienation stemming from the French government&#x27;s changed position towards Algeria. Until independence, Algeria was legally a part of France; after independence many felt that they had been betrayed and were now portrayed as an &quot;embarrassment&quot; to their country or to blame for the war. Most &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; felt a powerful sense of loss and a longing for their lost homeland in Algeria. The American author Claire Messud remembered seeing her &quot;pied-noir&quot; father, a lapsed Catholic, crying while watching Pope John Paul II deliver a Mass on his TV. When asked why, Messud &quot;père&quot; replied: &quot;Because when I last heard the mass in Latin, I thought I had a religion, and I thought I had a country.&quot; Messud noted that the novelist Albert Camus, himself a &quot;pied-noir&quot;, had often written of his love for the sea-shores and mountains of Algeria, declaring Algeria was a place that was a part of his soul, feelings she noted mirrored those of other &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; for whom Algeria was the only home they had ever known.

====&quot;Pieds-noirs&quot; who remained====

In the aftermath of the war, some &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; chose to remain in Algeria; their population was recorded at standing around 200,000 in October 1962. By 1965 their population had dropped to around 50,000.

Under the Algerian Nationality Code of 1963, &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; were permitted to obtain Algerian citizenship, but political reluctance by the FLN and the slowness of the process prompted some &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; to emigrate over choosing citizenship. In 1965, it was believed more than 500 ethnic European persons had applied for Algerian citizenship, with 200 having been born in Algeria.

In recent decades, it has been harder to determine the total population of &quot;pied-noir&quot; heritage in Algeria. In 1979, &quot;Le Monde&quot; journalist Daniel Junqua put the population as being around 3,000. In 1993, French historian Hélène Bracco claimed the population to be higher at around 30,000 but noted most were elderly. Lingering political instability and events such as the Algerian civil war prompted many remaining Algerians of European descent to leave the country and apply for citizenship of France. The French Consulate in Algiers recorded that around 300 persons of European descent remain in the country, whereas an Algerian census company recorded the number as higher.

===État pied-noir===
In 2016, a group of &quot;pied-noir&quot; activists headed by Jacques Villard set up the &quot;Gouvernement provisoire Pied-Noir en exil&quot; () in Montpellier in response to what they argued has been marginalization against the &quot;pied-noir&quot; community by successive governments in France. The movement has been referred to as État pied-noir. Since 2022, some of its members call for the establishment of an autonomous &quot;pied-noir&quot; national territory in Algeria or the French mainland.

==Flags==
==The Song of the Africans==
The &quot;pied-noir&quot; community has adopted, as both an unofficial anthem and as a symbol of its identity, Captain Félix Boyer&#x27;s 1943 version of &quot;Le Chant des Africains&quot; (). This was a 1915 &quot;Infanterie de Marine&quot; marching song, originally titled &quot;C&#x27;est nous les Marocains&quot; () and dedicated to Colonel Van Hecke, commander of a World War I cavalry unit: the &quot;7e régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique&quot; (&quot;7th African Light Cavalry Regiment&quot;). Boyer&#x27;s song was adopted during World War II by the Free French First Army that was drawn from units of the Army of Africa and included many &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;. The music and words were later used by the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; to proclaim their allegiance to France.

The &quot;Song of the Africans&quot; was banned from use as official military music in 1962 at the end of the Algerian War until August 1969. The French Minister of Veterans Affairs (&quot;Ministre des Anciens Combattants&quot;) at the time, Henri Duvillard, lifted the prohibition.

<text>The 1922 Committee, formally known as the Conservative Private Members&#x27; Committee, or sometimes simply the 22, is the parliamentary group of the Conservative Party in the British House of Commons. The committee, consisting of all Conservative backbench Members of Parliament (MPs), meets weekly while Parliament is in session and provides a way for backbenchers to co-ordinate and discuss their views independently of frontbenchers. Its executive membership and officers are by consensus limited to backbench MPs; however, since 2010, frontbench Conservative MPs have an open invitation to attend meetings.

The committee can also play an important role in choosing the party leader. The group was formed in 1923 (by MPs who were elected in 1922), but became important after 1940. The committee, collectively, represents the views of the Conservative Party parliamentary rank and file to the party leader, who is usually also the Prime Minister or leader of the Opposition. Whips are present but their role is limited to announcing future business and reporting questions and complaints to the chief whip. Due to the number of members, the group traditionally meets in Committee Room 14, the largest committee room in the Houses of Parliament.

==Committee constitutional matters==
The 1922 Committee has an 18-member executive committee, whose members are elected by all Conservative MPs except those who are members of the Government, i.e. the electorate comprises all &quot;backbench&quot; Conservative MPs. Candidates need to be nominated by two Conservative colleagues, and it is a first-past-the-post voting system, meaning the person with the most votes in each category wins.

The committee oversees the election of party leaders, or any Conservative party-led vote of confidence in a current leader. Such a vote can be triggered by 15% of Conservative MPs (currently 19 MPs out of the 121 sitting Conservative MPs ) writing a letter to the chairman of the committee asking for such a vote. This process was used most recently on 6 June 2022, against Boris Johnson. The last time a leader lost such a vote was on 29 October 2003, when Iain Duncan Smith was defeated by 90 to 75. However both May and Johnson chose to resign within a year of their confidence votes.

==History==
The name does not, as is sometimes wrongly supposed, stem from the 19 October 1922 Carlton Club meeting, in which Conservative MPs successfully demanded that the party withdraw from the coalition government of David Lloyd George, and which triggered the 1922 general election. The committee was formed following the election, in April 1923. 

The MPs who founded the committee were not the same as those who had taken the decision to end the 1916–1922 coalition government. It began as a small dining group of new members elected in 1922. The committee soon developed into a ginger group of active backbenchers. After the 1923 and 1924 elections, the membership expanded as more new Conservative MPs were elected, and in 1926 all backbench MPs were invited to become members. It became known as the Conservative Private Members&#x27; Committee. Consequently, it became a platform for the majority rather than a focus for discontent.

In 1990, the committee participated in the ousting of Margaret Thatcher. The term &quot;men in grey suits&quot;, meaning a delegation of Conservative MPs who tell a party leader that it is time for them to step down without forcing an open challenge, is often used in reference to members of the 1922 Committee.

On 19 May 2010, shortly after the Conservatives had formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, Prime Minister David Cameron suggested altering the committee to involve frontbench ministers in the recommendation forming process, angering some backbench MPs. On 20 May 2010, committee members voted to approve the change, with 168 votes in favour and 118 against. Many backbench party members criticised the move and voted against it, while ministers had argued such a change would be necessary to continue operating coherently as a party during its membership of a coalition government.

However, under Graham Brady, who became chairman in 2010, it was clarified shortly after that vote that although frontbenchers became eligible to attend meetings of the committee, only backbenchers would be able to vote for its officers and executive committee, similarly to the Parliamentary Labour Party.

On 7 March 2023, Brady announced that he would not seek re-election at the 2024 general election. The Committee was left with two remaining members after the general election, who were the only two Conservative Party MPs to stand. They were Bob Blackman, the MP for Harrow East, who increased his majority in the election despite a national Labour landslide, and Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the MP for the newly formed constituency of North Cotswolds, who has been an MP since 1992. Blackman won the contest by a 61 votes to 37 with 98 votes cast.

== The 2024 committee election ==

The latest election for the Chair of the 1922 Committee was held on July 9, 2024. The former chair, Graham Brady, had stood down as an MP in the 2024 general election, creating a vacancy. Bob Blackman and Geoffrey Clifton-Brown stood as candidates, with Blackman winning the carrying the election with 61 out of 121 possible votes. 

Media reports showed that several members were unable to vote, due to a misunderstanding of the closing time of the vote. This included senior Conservatives such as Mark Francois, Jeremy Hunt and Edward Leigh. In total, only 98 out of 121 MPs turned out (81%). However, with Blackman winning an absolute majority of Conservative MPs, the remaining 23 MPs would not have affected the outcome.

The results of the election were as follows:

Following the vote for the Chair, there were subsequent votes to elect the 1922 Executive board. One MP with nominations was left off the ballot paper, leading to calls to re-run the vote.

<doc id="351158" wikidata="Q459759" url="?curid=351158" title="Chai Nat province">
<text>Chai Nat (, ) is one of the central provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. Neighbouring provinces are (from north clockwise) Nakhon Sawan, Sing Buri, Suphan Buri, and Uthai Thani. The town of Chai Nat is 188 km north of Bangkok.

==Geography==
Chai Nat is on the flat river plain of central Thailand&#x27;s Chao Phraya River valley. In the south of the province, the Chao Phraya Dam (formerly Chai Nat Dam) impounds the Chao Phraya River, both for flood control as well as to divert water into the country&#x27;s largest irrigation system for the irrigation of rice paddies in the lower river valley. The dam, part of the Greater Chao Phraya Project, was finished in 1957 and was the first dam constructed in Thailand. The total forest area is or 2.6 percent of the provincial area.

==History==
Chai Nat was first established during the Ayutthaya period and was used as a successful base of operations for confronting the Burmese army. As the Burmese were defeated every time, the area earned the name Chai Nat, meaning &#x27;place of victory&#x27;.

After World War II, when the Japanese had left, economic conditions were bad and food was in short supply. Chai Nat suffered this problem especially badly when bandits gathered in the countryside stealing cattle and inciting violence and crime.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows a dhammachakka with a mountain in the background. It refers to the Dhammachak Buddha image housed in the hall of Wat Dhammamoen, built on the slope of a mountain.

The provincial tree is the bael fruit tree (&quot;Aegle marmelos&quot;), and the provincial flower is the Rainbow Shower tree (&quot;Cassia javanica&quot;). Bleeker&#x27;s sheatfish (&quot;Phalacronotus bleekeri&quot;) is the provincial fish.

<text>Algeciras () is a city and a municipality of Spain belonging to the province of Cádiz, Andalusia. Located in the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, near the Strait of Gibraltar, it is the largest city on the Bay of Gibraltar (). 

The Port of Algeciras is one of the largest ports in Europe and the world in three categories: container, cargo and transshipment. The urban area straddles the small Río de la Miel, which is the southernmost river of continental Europe. As of 1 January 2020, the municipality had a registered population of 123,078, second in its province after Jerez de la Frontera and greater than Cádiz city population. It forms part of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Campo de Gibraltar.

The surrounding metro area also includes the municipalities of Los Barrios, La Línea de la Concepción, Castellar de la Frontera, Jimena de la Frontera, San Roque and Tarifa, with a population of 263,739.

==Name==
The Arabic name for the settlement founded by Muslims after the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula was (, &quot;The Green Island&quot;), in reference to Isla Verde. gave the modern Spanish . Algeciras&#x27; site was also that of Roman cities called (&quot;White Harbor&quot;), (current Getares) and . In the later &quot;Byzantine&quot; period, the site would come to be known in Greek as (), meaning &quot;between rivers/canals&quot;.

==History==

The area of the city has been populated since prehistory, and the earliest remains belong to Neanderthal populations from the Paleolithic era.

Due to its strategic position it was an important port under the Phoenicians, and was the site of the relevant Roman port of &quot;Portus Albus&quot; (&quot;White Port&quot;), with two nearby cities called &quot;Caetaria&quot; (possibly founded by the Iberians) and &quot;Iulia Traducta&quot;, founded by the Romans.

Recently it has been proposed that the site of &quot;Iulia Transducta&quot; was the &quot;Villa Vieja&quot; of Algeciras.

After being destroyed by the Goths and their Vandal allies, the city was under the control of the Visigothic kingdom until Tarik landed in Algeciras and Tarifa in April 711.

In the year 859 AD Viking troops on board 62 drekars and commanded by the leaders Hastein and Björn Ironside besieged the city for three days and subsequently laid waste to much of it. After looting the houses of the rich, they burnt the Aljama mosque and the Banderas mosque. Reorganized near the medina, the inhabitants managed to recover the city and make the invaders run away, capturing two boats.

It enjoyed a brief period of independence as a taifa state from 1035 to 1058. It was named &quot;al-Jazirah al-Khadra&quot;&#x27; (&quot;Green Island&quot;) after the offshore Isla Verde; the modern name is derived from this original Arabic name (compare also Algiers and Al Jazeera). In 1055 Emir Al-Mutadid of Seville drove the Berbers from Algeciras, claiming it for Arabs.

Vowing to counter the Castilian expansion initiated by 1265, Nasrid Granada required assistance from Fez in late 1274 and ceded the place of Algeciras (together with Tarifa) to the Marinids.

In 1278, Algeciras was besieged by the forces of the Kingdom of Castile under the command of Alfonso X of Castile and his son, Sancho. This siege was the first of a series of attempts to take the city and ended in failure for the Castilian forces. An armada sent by Castile was also annihilated whilst trying to blockade the city&#x27;s harbor.

The Marinid grip over the town further increased in the ensuing decades, and the place turned into a Marinid stronghold from which razzias were launched into the still incipient Christian settlements in the Lower Guadalquivir and the Guadalete area.

In July 1309, Ferdinand IV of Castile laid the first Siege of Algeciras as well as Gibraltar. The latter fell into Christian hands, but Muslim Algeciras held on for the following three decades, until Alfonso XI of Castile began a second Siege of Algeciras in 1342. Juan Núñez de Lara, Juan Manuel, Pedro Fernández de Castro, Juan Alfonso de la Cerda, lord of Gibraleón all participated in the siege, as did knights from France, England and Germany, and even King Philip III of Navarre, king consort of Navarra, who came accompanied by 100 horsemen and 300 infantry. In March 1344, after several years of siege, Algeciras surrendered.

On winning the city, Alfonso XI made it the seat of a new diocese, established by Pope Clement VI&#x27;s bull &quot;Gaudemus et exultamus&quot; of 30 April 1344, and entrusted to the governance of the bishop of Cadiz. The bishops of Cadiz continued to hold the title of Aliezira, as it called, until 1851, when in accordance with a concordat between Spain and the Holy See its territory was incorporated into the diocese of Cadiz. No longer a residential bishopric, Aliezira is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

Left relatively unguarded during the Castilian Civil War, the town was easily seized in 1369 by the Nasrids from Granada with assistance from a Marinid fleet. It was destroyed on the orders of Muhammed V of Granada. While tradition asserts that it was torn down immediately after the 1369 occupation, the Nasrid scorched-earth policy has been also dated to 1375, once Granadan repopulation efforts should have failed. The garrison was thus relocated to Gibraltar, with a worse port but more easily defensible, in Nasrid control after the Marinid retreat from the Iberian Peninsula. While the jurisdiction was ceded to Gibraltar in 1462 after the Castilian conquest of the latter place, there are hints about the continued existence of informal settlements by farmers and sepherds in the area, at least after 1466.
Algeciras was refounded after 1704 by refugees from Gibraltar following the territory&#x27;s capture by Anglo-Dutch forces in the War of the Spanish Succession. As early as 1705, the place was described as &quot;...a heap of stones...only a few hovels scattered here and there, amidst an infinity of ruins&quot;. The sense of temporariness among the displaced population and the hopes for a return to Gibraltar were shattered by the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. Besides Gibraltarians, throughout the 18th century repopulation was also participated by settlers from the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and from elsewhere, standing out Italians in the latter regard. Population rapidly increased (from 1,845 in 1725 to 6,241 in 1787). The Algeciras&#x27; social structure featured a comparatively small number of nobles and comparatively larger weight of clergy. Just like the rest of the Campo de Gibraltar, husbandry (cattle in particular) played an important role in the economy during the 18th century thanks to the rich pastures. Given the abundance of international conflicts in the Strait area during the 18th century, corsair activities against ships belligerent with Spain or neutral ships provisioning the enemy also became an important part of the economy.

It was fortified to guard against British raids with installations such as the Fuerte de Isla Verde built to guard key points. The city was rebuilt on its present rectangular plan by Charles III in 1760. In July 1801, the French and Spanish navies fought the British Royal Navy offshore in the Battle of Algeciras, which ended in a British victory.

The city became the scene for settling a major international crisis as it hosted the Algeciras Conference in 1906. The international forum to discuss the future of Morocco which was held in the Casa Consistorial (town hall). It confirmed the independence of Morocco against threats from Germany, and gave France control of banking and police interests. In July 1942 Italian frogmen set up in a secret base in the Italian tanker Olterra, which was interned in Algeciras, in order to attack shipping in Gibraltar. During the Franco era, Algeciras underwent substantial industrial development, creating many new jobs for the local workers made unemployed when the border between Gibraltar and Spain was sealed by Franco between 1969 and 1982.

In 1982 there was a failed plan codenamed Operation Algeciras conceived by the Argentinian military to sabotage the British military facilities in Gibraltar during the Falklands War. The Spanish authorities intervened just before the attack, and deported the two Argentine Montoneros and military liaison officer involved.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===

Algeciras is located in the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, in the &quot;comarca&quot; of Campo de Gibraltar. Its strategic location near the Strait of Gibraltar—the choke point connecting the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea also entailing the nearest distance between Europe and the African continent—has historically powered the importance of the port. The city proper lies on the western bank of the Bay of Gibraltar, fronting the Rock of Gibraltar, which dominates the eastern bank.

The municipality spans across a total area of , bordering with the municipalities of Los Barrios and Tarifa. The lower course of the river Palmones forms part of the boundary of Algeciras with the municipality of Los Barrios.

The urban agglomeration formed by Algeciras and the surrounding settlements is the sixth largest in Andalusia and the third largest off the region&#x27;s coast.

===Climate===
Algeciras has a Mediterranean subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with very mild, rainy winters and warm, dry summers with occasional heat waves, and temperature fluctuations are small because of the strong Oceanic influence. There are no snow registers in the city since the 19th century.


==Population==
==Economy==
Algeciras is principally a transport hub and industrial city. Its main activities are connected with the Port of Algeciras, which serves as the main embarkation point between Spain and Tangier and other ports in Morocco as well as the Canary Islands and the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. It is ranked as the 16th busiest port in the world. The city also has a substantial fishing industry and exports a range of agricultural products from the surrounding area, including cereals, tobacco and farm animals.

In recent years it has become a significant tourist destination, with popular day trips to Tarifa to see bird migrations; to Gibraltar to see the territory&#x27;s sights and culture; and to the Bay of Gibraltar on whale watching excursions.

Algeciras is the southern terminus of two principal north–south Euroroutes, the E05 and E15. Both routes, moreover, run to Scotland (the E05 terminates at Greenock and the E15 at Inverness) via France and England.

<text>The National Association of College and University Residence Halls Incorporated (NACURH) is an international organization made up of eight regions. The eight regions cover the entire United States and parts of Canada. Previously it has also covered parts of Mexico and The Bahamas. NACURH brings together students who live in residence halls on college campuses to share ideas, resources, and best practices in order to improve their residential communities.

== Mission and vision ==
=== Mission ===
&quot;As an organization, NACURH creates environments that empower, motivate, and equip residence hall leaders by providing them with skills and resources in order for them to excel and positively impact their campus communities. .&quot;

=== Vision ===
&quot;The National Association of College and University Residence Halls, NACURH Incorporated, seeks to create a network of civically engaged students sharing common experiences through residential leadership opportunities.&quot;

== History ==
In 1954, Iowa State University, the University of Colorado, the University of Missouri and the University of Northern Iowa formed the Midwest Dormitory Conference. The conference was the brainchild of Iowa State&#x27;s Student Residence Hall Government, which felt that such an organization was needed to encourage the exchange of ideas and information. All four schools sent delegations to the first conference, which was held in the same year. In 1955, the name of the group was changed to the Association of College and University Residence Halls (ACURH). By 1957, the organization had expanded to 11 institutional members.

A similar organization, the Inter-Mountain Residence Hall Association (IMRHA), merged with ACURH in 1961, necessitating a name change to the National Association of College and University Residence Halls (NACURH). The association was split into two &quot;associate&quot; regions, the Midwest Association (MACURH) and the Inter-Mountain Association (IACURH), based on the two original groups. By 1963, the organization had expanded to 26 institutional members.

In 1964, the Pacific Association (PACURH), the North Atlantic Association (NAACURH) and the South Atlantic Association (SAACURH) were all created &quot;on paper&quot; to allow for possible future growth of the organization. In this same year, the National Residence Hall Honorary was also created by NACURH. By 1963, the organization had expanded to 41 institutional members.

In 1968, the Great Lakes Region (GLACURH) was split from the Midwest Association of NACURH, bringing the number of regions to six. By this time, 130 schools were officially affiliated with NACURH, tripling the number of members from 1967. NACURH&#x27;s mailing list also officially included member schools or contacts in all fifty states, plus several Canadian schools. The National Information Center (NIC) was also created in 1968.

In 1971, NACURH incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit under Oklahoma law, granting the organization and its associate regions non-profit incorporation. This change in tax status meant that the regional associations became regional affiliates.

In 1980, the Midwest Affiliate was again split between the new Southwest Affiliate (SWACURH) and the Midwest Affiliate. This brought the total number of affiliate regions to seven. Institutional membership had also increased to 135.

In 1991 the North Atlantic Affiliate was split wholly to form two new regions for NACURH, the Central Atlantic (CAACURH) and the North Eastern (NEACURH) regions. This brought the total number of affiliate regions to eight, the current number. Additionally, the 1991 conference held at Arizona State University was record-breaking in terms of the number of delegates present, at 2,188.

In 1997, NACURH and its Affiliates gained tax-exempt status.

In 2016, NACURH Executives passed an amendment to the NACURH Policy Books. This amendment would un-affiliate NACURH from the various state associations/organizations/groups that existed around the country. In doing so, it was decided that NACURH and its affiliates would not fund, participate, coordinate, recognize, set aside time for state business, or conduct business with state level associations, groups and organizations or similar. As well, NACURH would prohibit state level associations and organizations from receiving benefits and services from corporate partners and sponsors. Furthermore, NRHH would no longer provide their benefits and services to state level associations and organizations.

At the 2019 annual business meeting, many regions voted to strike international affiliates from their regional charters. This decision was made due to the fact that though many regions claim to represent various international affiliates, many regions have not had any international colleges/universities affiliated in the past 3 years+. Regions with currently active/affiliated international colleges/universities would be allowed to keep these affiliates in their charters. Any international colleges/universities that may wish to affiliate with NACURH whose state/province/country is not explicitly stated in any region&#x27;s charter, may apply for affiliate membership and then discuss with NACURH Executives to find which region would be the best fit for them.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, NACURH hosted its first-ever entirely virtual annual conference. The conference was planned to be hosted at University of Dayton which was then moved to be entirely virtual for fears of the spreading virus impacting those attending the conference from all around the country.

== Strategic planning ==

In 2014 through 2015, NACURH formed a strategic planning commission led by members of the Boards of Directors per a resolution passed in May 2014. The purpose of the NACURH Strategic Plan is to provide a clear direction for the future of the organization and company. With a clear direction, NACURH commits itself to providing residence hall leaders with skills and resources that they need in order to excel and positively impact their campus communities. This group performed the NACURH Services and Performance Assessment (NSPA) on the corporation as a whole, and, as a result, created a strategic plan for years 2015–2018. The new plan outlines necessary steps to improve NACURH and the way it serves member schools.

Throughout the 2023-2024 affiliation year, a new Strategic Planning Committee was formed, and at the 2024 Annual Business Meeting the NACURH Board of Directors voted to confirm a new 2024-2027 NACURH Strategic Plan. This plan is composed of five focus areas covering a variety of educational and growth components, as well as promoting adaptability and forward thought. 

==NACURH offices==

===NACURH Information Centre (NIC) (1967–2017)===
Created in 1968, The NIC was the business office of NACURH, Inc. The NIC&#x27;s projects and responsibilities included: Maintaining the Resource File Index, updating and maintaining the national website, and keeping records of the dues of member schools. The NIC was merged with the NSRO to form the NCO following the close of the 2017 Annual Conference.

===NACURH Services and Recognition Office (NSRO) (2007–2017)===
The NSRO was created in 2007 when it succeeded the NRHH office. The NSRO Office was the services office of NACURH, Inc. and served as a support office for NACURH. The NSRO was created to provide non-technical services to NACURH and its member schools. The NSRO was charged with creating and selling merchandise (pins, apparel, etc.) and creating and maintaining special national projects and developing other services for NACURH, Inc. as needed. The NSRO was merged with the NIC to form the NCO following the close of the 2017 Annual Conference.

===NACURH Corporate Office (NCO)===
During the NACURH 2016 Annual Conference, Boardroom Representatives voted to combine the NIC and the NSRO into the NACURH Corporate Office (NCO). The NACURH Corporate Office (NCO) serves as the Corporate Headquarters for NACURH, and is the central contact point for all correspondence. The NCO takes on the combined responsibilities of the former NSRO and NIC. Like other branches of NACURH, the NCO is entirely student-run by volunteer staff members from the host institution. The NCO was hosted at The University of Delaware.

During the 2019-2020 affiliation year, it was determined that ACUHO-I, the professional international organization for College and University Housing Staff would become the permanent hosts of the NACURH Corporate Office and would manage the customer service aspects of hosting the office.

During the 2022-2023 affiliation year, it was determined that ACUHO-I would no longer host the NACURH Corporate Office, and beginning in the 2023-2024 affiliation year, Kent State University began as the host institution for the Corporate Office. The new NACURH Corporate Office requires that the Director for Merchandise and Operations, AD for Administration and Finance, as well as two (2) additional AD positions be filled by students at the Host institution, alongside one advisor. The rest are selected from any NACURH affiliated institution in good standing.

<doc id="351172" wikidata="Q2714180" url="?curid=351172" title="BMX XXX">
<text>BMX XXX is a 2002 sports video game developed by Z-Axis and published by Acclaim Entertainment under their AKA Acclaim label for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube. While primarily a BMX-based action sports title, the game places a distinct emphasis on off-color and sexual humor, and allows the player to create female characters that are fully topless. The game also features unlockable live-action footage of real-life strippers courtesy of Scores, a New York-based stripclub.

&quot;BMX XXX&quot; began development in 2001 as a traditional entry in the &quot;Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX&quot; series, and was announced as &quot;Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 3&quot;. The executives of Z-Axis and Acclaim — influenced by a crowded action sports game market, a dire financial situation, and the commercial success of the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series — decided to insert nudity and mature humor into the game to increase publicity and sales. Although Dave Mirra initially supported the pitched concept, his name was eventually dissociated from the title following its unveiling at E3. The development team members were displeased with the change in direction, with some attempting to distance themselves from the production.

Despite an aggressive marketing campaign, the game&#x27;s distribution was impeded by various circumstances; major retailers refused to stock the title, Sony Computer Entertainment refused to publish the PlayStation 2 version unless the topless female nudity was censored, and the game was initially banned in Australia. 

Upon release, &quot;BMX XXX&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, who felt that the game lacked innovation despite its content. Although the control scheme and voice acting were complimented, opinions on the soundtrack were mixed, and reviewers faulted the camera, level design, mission objectives, visuals, and humor. As a result of its limited distribution and loss of celebrity endorsement, &quot;BMX XXX&quot; was a commercial failure. It subsequently became a factor in a series of lawsuits against Acclaim by Mirra and the company&#x27;s shareholders, and was cited as one of a number of failures that contributed to Acclaim&#x27;s 2004 bankruptcy and liquidation.

==Gameplay==

&quot;BMX XXX&quot; is a freestyle BMX sports game with an emphasis on off-color and sexual humor. The player character can be customized by name, gender, and physical attributes, or selected from a number of pre-made characters; the ability to create topless female riders is enabled when the single-player campaign is fully completed. The player&#x27;s rider can perform a variety of tricks in midair with the combined input of a direction on the D-pad or left thumbstick and a button. The player can also grind on rails, ledges, or other likely surfaces, and can exit a grind by jumping into the air or falling out of balance. The player is awarded points by performing complete tricks and landing while the bike is properly oriented. The player character will be ejected from their bike if they are not oriented for a successful landing or if they crash into something with a part of the body or bike other than their feet, wheels, or grind pegs during a trick. The player character will also be ejected if they are riding off-balance and hit an obstacle too fast or at a harsh angle. In the event of a crash, the player&#x27;s score is reset.

The single-player campaign is divided into eight levels, six of which are based on a series of challenges that the player must complete to advance to the next level. Challenges are often initiated by interacting with a character within the level, who will give the player an objective to fulfill. Completing ten challenges within a level will grant access to the next level. Scattered within each level are four collectible bike parts; accumulating complete sets of six parts within the campaign unlocks upgraded bikes that enhance the player&#x27;s performance. Each level also features a series of 45 collectibles such as coins, as well as 20 gaps in the terrain to discover. Completing certain challenges unlocks full-motion video sequences of strippers, with videos unlocked in later levels displaying an increasing amount of nudity. Two of the levels are competitions that require the player to perform a variety of tricks and earn a medal.

The game includes three multiplayer modes in which two human players compete against each other. In &quot;Strip Challenge&quot;, players aim to achieve the highest-scoring trick combination. When a player breaks the record, the opponent&#x27;s character loses a piece of clothing, and the game ends when one player renders their opponent naked. In &quot;Skillz&quot;, players compete to achieve the highest score over a two-minute run, and in &quot;Paintball&quot;, one player must collect all the boomboxes within a level while their opponent attempts to snipe them.

==Development==
In 2001, &quot;Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX&quot; developer Z-Axis began production on the third installment of the series, aiming to expand the technology and include such features as a story, voice-acting, and mission-based gameplay. Lead artist Mark Girouard described the game&#x27;s original narrative as centering on a BMX team on tour throughout the United States. In January 2002, series publisher Acclaim Entertainment announced &quot;Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 3&quot;, which would have showcased freestyle BMX rider Dave Mirra alongside sixteen other professionals.
Around this time, the action sports genre had become crowded, prompting executives of Z-Axis and Acclaim to ponder new angles for increasing publicity. During a meeting between the parties, someone suggested adding strippers to the game in jest. While this initially elicited laughter, the group began seriously considering the idea, with Acclaim hoping that appealing to an older audience would increase sales. Acclaim marketing coordinator Zach Smith noted that the company&#x27;s decision to insert nudity in the game was influenced by their dire financial situation at the time, and Acclaim executive producer Shawn Rosen additionally cited the commercial success of the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series as the catalyst for backing an adult-oriented title. Director Glen Egan acknowledged the increasing success of M-rated games, and was encouraged to pursue the rating by his irritation at having to excise drug references and profanity from the soundtracks of the previous two &quot;Dave Mirra&quot; titles. Acclaim director of public relations Alan Lewis commented that the aging gamer demographic made adult humor essential in appealing to audiences that began their hobby in earlier generations.

In March 2002, Mirra and Acclaim began discussions about attaching his name to the title, which Mirra felt would be a more tongue-in-cheek and mature game comparable to the parodic film &quot;Airplane!&quot;. Rosen claimed that while Mirra found the pitched concept humorous, sponsors warned Mirra that the game would be harmful to his image. Acclaim looked to sex comedies and &quot;Jackass&quot; as inspiration for the game&#x27;s sexual humor and raunchy dialogue. Egan also cited Bam Margera&#x27;s &quot;Camp Kill Yourself&quot; video series as an influence on the game&#x27;s bold and irreverent humor and action. For the game, Acclaim formed a partnership with the New York-based stripclub Scores, with footage of its employees being included as unlockable content. Lead designer Tin Guerrero postulated that this decision was influenced by the popularity of Howard Stern at the time, with Scores apparently being his favorite stripclub. The footage was filmed by Acclaim without Z-Axis&#x27;s involvement.

The game&#x27;s change in direction required Z-Axis&#x27;s development team to redesign a significant amount of content they had completed thus far, retooling what would have been &quot;Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 3&quot; into &quot;Dave Mirra BMX XXX&quot;. The team members were dismayed by the decision, with Girouard recalling it as &quot;the biggest creative shock I&#x27;ve ever experienced in games through all these years&quot;. Some members tried to distance themselves from the production by leaving their full names out of the credits, opting to either abbreviate their surnames or use the names of historical figures such as Fletcher Christian. The team was unable to object due to the company management&#x27;s support of the direction and their multi-game contractual obligation to Acclaim concerning the &quot;Dave Mirra&quot; series. Despite being frustrated by their circumstance, the development team would not work perfunctorily, and remained driven to create a satisfying game. The game runs on the same engine previously used by Z-Axis&#x27;s &quot;Aggressive Inline&quot;. The script was written by &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot; co-creator Warren Graff, who wrote nearly 500 pages of dialogue for the game&#x27;s characters.

On August 19, 2002, Acclaim announced that Dave Mirra&#x27;s name had been removed from the title, and that he and the other professional riders, as well as licensed equipment, would not be featured in the game. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; speculated that the move was made by Acclaim to preserve creative control over the game&#x27;s content while preventing damage to the images of the previously involved riders and equipment manufacturers. While Egan was perplexed by Acclaim&#x27;s decision considering Mirra&#x27;s supposed importance to the property, Guerrero alleged a souring relationship between Acclaim and Mirra as a factor. Regardless, Acclaim&#x27;s licensing deal with Mirra stood intact, with a &quot;Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 3&quot; title planned for release. The game would be released for the Game Boy Advance on November 25, 2002.

==Marketing and release==
&quot;Dave Mirra BMX XXX&quot; was showcased at E3 in May 2002. &quot;IGN PS2&quot;, in its &quot;Best of E3 2002 Awards&quot;, named it runner-up in the &quot;Biggest Surprise&quot; category, describing it as &quot;a surprise in every sense of the word&quot; and proclaiming that &quot;any title that&#x27;s working hard to perfect &#x27;Boob-Jiggle Technology&#x27; deserves a questionable double take&quot;.

In September 2002, a rumor circulated that Sony Computer Entertainment would not approve the PlayStation 2 (PS2) version of the game unless certain sexual content was removed. On November 4, Acclaim representatives Alan Lewis and Tara Blanco confirmed the rumor, stating that the PS2 version would be edited to eliminate the topless nudity. An anonymous Sony representative claimed that the topless female imagery posed a detrimental threat to Sony&#x27;s console brand, and believed that it was not fundamentally crucial to the gameplay experience.

Acclaim launched an aggressive $3-4 million advertising campaign for the game, featuring irreverent jokes and the tagline &quot;This is BMX?&quot;. On October 17, 2002, Acclaim unveiled the game&#x27;s soundtrack, which consists of a mixture of classic and modern rock and hip hop. On November 7, Acclaim launched a &quot;Ms. BMX XXX&quot; competition, in which female contestants submitted a digital photo of themselves or a friend, which was subject to a public vote. The winner was flown to New York City and escorted to Scores by Gary Dell&#x27;Abate and K.C. Armstrong of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;.

On October 14, 2002, &quot;Reuters&quot; reported that Walmart, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, and KB Toys had refused to stock the title. Although Guerrero regarded Walmart&#x27;s motion as a &quot;dagger blow&quot;, he found humor in the retailer&#x27;s contemporary distribution of guns and ammunition. &quot;BMX XXX&quot; was released in North America for the Xbox on November 15, 2002, for the PlayStation 2 on November 16, and for the GameCube on November 25. In the United Kingdom, it was released for GameCube and Xbox on December 6 and for the PlayStation 2 on February 7, 2003. It would be Z-Axis&#x27;s last game for Acclaim before their acquisition by Activision, which was announced at the same time as the game&#x27;s unveiling at E3. Those who pre-ordered the game from EB Games or GameStop received a free t-shirt. The game was initially banned in Australia, but was released in the country after the removal of its sexual content.

==Reception==
&quot;BMX XXX&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic, with some reviewers concluding that the game was lacking in innovation outside of its vulgarity and sexual content. Todd Zuniga of &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; further denounced the game as &quot;the worst example of what PS2 games are capable of&quot;, and described it as milquetoast in all gameplay aspects. However, Steve Steinberg of &quot;GameSpy&quot; and the reviewers of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; considered it to be a solid gaming experience despite its crude content, with Steinberg pointing out that the game&#x27;s &quot;twisted novelty&quot; could not function in other genres, and worked because of the game&#x27;s fundamental playability. Scott Steinberg of &quot;Playboy&quot; also opined that the title was at its strongest outside of its comedic elements, attributing the gameplay&#x27;s refinements over the course of a more mundane franchise.

The control scheme was mostly found to be comfortable and intuitive, though Bryn Williams of &quot;GameSpy&quot; and Justin Nation of &quot;Planet GameCube&quot; considered the stunt system to be simplified compared to other extreme sports titles such as &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;. Although Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; was impressed by the variety of tricks, he felt that none of them seemed special or important, and pointed out that the game engine&#x27;s unrealistic quirks reduced the sense of challenge. Scott Alan Marriott of &quot;AllGame&quot;, Dan Leahy of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, and AM Urbanek of &quot;TechTV&quot; observed a lack of inertia in the player&#x27;s bike, which contributed to a sense of inconsistency in the controls. Although Steve Steinberg commended the camera as solid and logically placed, others criticized it as jumpy and jerky, with Marriott and &quot;IGN&quot;″s Matt Casamassina citing a tendency to bounce off walls and barriers, and Zuniga expressing frustration at having to stop the bike to look around.

The levels were said to not be as large and creative as those in Z-Axis&#x27;s previous efforts, and their design was faulted as barren, with an abundance of spaces bereft of features. Reviewers complained of the vague challenge objectives, which were exacerbated by the lack of any source of direction or orientation; Steve Steinberg and Gerstmann cited a specific instance of an early mission that tasked the player with running down a &quot;fruitbooter&quot; while giving no indication that the term is derogatory slang for an inline skater. The necessity of returning to a non-player character&#x27;s position to retry a failed challenge was an additional annoyance, with Matt Helgeson of &quot;Game Informer&quot; noting that the characters do not always stay at their post. Helgeson, fellow &quot;Game Informer&quot; reviewer Justin Leeper, and Aaron Boulding of &quot;IGN&quot; were unenthused by the high amount of scavenger hunt missions, though Leeper found some objectives humorous, and Casamassina complimented their presentation. Socrates of &quot;TeamXbox&quot; enjoyed the multiplayer mode, but felt that the lack of the single-player campaign&#x27;s lewdness made the mode feel indistinct from other extreme sports titles. Steve Steinberg was uneased by the Paintball mode, and wondered how it was left intact after several games were delayed or reworked after the September 11 attacks. The stripper videos were noted to be insufficiently explicit for the &quot;XXX&quot; title, and reviewers felt that they were too difficult to unlock to be worth the effort, particularly for adults who have easier means to access explicit content.

Assessments of the visuals were generally unfavorable, with some reviewers finding them comparable to a PSone title. While the animation and frame rate were commended for their smoothness, the characters were criticized for their blocky models, stiff body movements, and blurry textures. Some pointed out that the rough character models worked against the game&#x27;s attempt at sex appeal, with Tom Bramwell of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; remarking that &quot;not since Orchid in the original &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; have I seen such angular assets&quot;. Nation further observed that a topless female biker in a third-person video game served little function beyond novelty due to the camera&#x27;s position behind her back as well as her hunched position. Dan Amrich of &quot;GamePro&quot; and Casamassina cited occasional collision issues in which riders temporarily sink through the ground or a wall. While Gerstmann and Casamassina described the environments as large in scope, Nick Valentino of &quot;GameZone&quot; felt that they were not as large or impressive as those in &quot;Aggressive Inline&quot;, and he and Bramwell found some areas to be plain and uninteresting. Marriott noticed some distant pop-up, and felt that the rider customization was insufficiently extensive. Socrates commented that the environments &quot;look like they have been coated in a layer of Vaseline&quot;, and he considered the stripper videos to be the game&#x27;s best-looking element. Boulding and Valentino also complimented the videos&#x27; professional quality, with Boulding stating that they &quot;might convince you that you&#x27;re watching an episode of &quot;G String Divas&quot; but without all of that talking and emoting&quot;. Nation, however, determined the production to be low-budget, saying that it &quot;looks like it was copied off of a copy of an older Super 8 tape&quot;.

The soundtrack was classified as a combination of rock, punk, hip hop and ska that was typical of the extreme sports genre, with Casamassina remarking that the selections, though well-executed, &quot;seem to appear on every extreme sports soundtrack in the universe&quot;. While Marriott, Amrich, and fellow &quot;GamePro&quot; reviewer Tokyo Drifter admired the soundtrack, Bramwell and Helgeson were not taken with it, with Bramwell being thankful for the Xbox version&#x27;s option to insert a custom playlist. Valentino found the background music&#x27;s downplayed prominence odd, and Gerstmann was perplexed by the soundtrack&#x27;s editing of racial slurs and drug references considering the marketing campaign&#x27;s emphasis on obscenity. Boulding was annoyed by an audio flaw that caused custom playlists to start again from the first track any time the music was paused for a gameplay reason, such as initiating a challenge. The sound effects were regarded as unremarkable and monotonous. Reactions to the voice acting were mostly positive, with Socrates elaborating that the humorous voices and accents successfully conveyed the game&#x27;s light-hearted tone, though Boulding and Urbanek noted that the game&#x27;s small pool of actors was evident, and the commentary from pedestrians was derided as repetitive. Marriott and Gerstmann were more negative, describing the voice-overs as grating and detrimental to the game&#x27;s attempts at humor.

The humor was generally dismissed as juvenile and off-putting, though Williams and Casamassina found some of the jokes effective. Helgeson remarked that the content was &quot;nothing that would raise an eyebrow on HBO&quot;, and concluded that those who were old enough to purchase the title would be too old to be shocked by it. Urbanek also saw irony in the demographic that he believed would find the game funny being too young to purchase it. Nation elaborated that the game&#x27;s jokes, on top of being tired, were lacking in context and delivery, and he concurred that the game&#x27;s lack of sophistication in its humor or sexual content, combined with the unremarkable gameplay, left its audience unclear. Marriott deemed the concept of a Mature-rated sports title nonsensical, and found the game&#x27;s presentation of a seedy urban tone unpleasant, proclaiming that &quot;being bombarded with obnoxious vendors and annoying pedestrians everywhere you turn should be considered a form of mental anguish&quot;. Nation, Zuniga and Urbanek accused the game&#x27;s content of misogyny and racism, with Nation pondering &quot;Why objectify women and stereotype several races and social classes so callously, taking a ton of criticism in the process, and then settle for such a poor excuse for a pay-off on all levels?&quot;.

==Legacy==
In February 2003, Mirra filed a $20 million lawsuit against Acclaim claiming that &quot;BMX XXX&quot; damaged his image. He explained that Acclaim allegedly used his name and likeness to promote &quot;BMX XXX&quot; after both parties agreed to disassociate his name from the product. The suit comprised a total of 11 claims, including unfair competition and injury to business reputation and dilution. Acclaim&#x27;s public relations director Alan Lewis denounced the lawsuit as baseless and declared that Acclaim would fight vigorously against it. In the following month, two additional lawsuits were filed by Acclaim&#x27;s shareholders alleging that the company&#x27;s management misled it and the public on five accounts of misinformation relevant to the company&#x27;s operations, including inadequate disclosure of the company&#x27;s plans to publish mature-themed games. The suits claimed that titles such as &quot;BMX XXX&quot; &quot;materially impeded the company&#x27;s ability to access broad-based retail channels&quot; and damaged revenue projections. On October 27, 2003, Acclaim announced that Mirra&#x27;s suit had been settled with no monetary or other damages being paid by either side, and that Mirra&#x27;s licensing agreement would continue until 2011. Additionally, Acclaim confirmed the development of a new &quot;Dave Mirra BMX&quot; game for next-generation systems.

The game&#x27;s limited distribution and loss of celebrity endorsement resulted in &quot;BMX XXX&quot; becoming Acclaim&#x27;s lowest-selling BMX title to date. According to Egan, the game sold a little over 160,000 copies by December 2005, making slightly under $5 million in its lifetime. The financial failure and lack of mass market appeal of &quot;BMX XXX&quot; among other titles was cited as a factor in Acclaim&#x27;s 2004 bankruptcy and liquidation. Rosen left Acclaim soon after the game&#x27;s release and eventually abandoned the video game industry, having established a koi pond business by 2017.

&quot;GameSpy&quot; included the game&#x27;s conception and Acclaim&#x27;s violation of its agreement not to use Mirra&#x27;s name and likeness to promote the game in its list of &quot;25 Dumbest Moments in Gaming&quot;. Mike Williams of &quot;USgamer&quot;, within his list of &quot;10 Games That Killed a Franchise&quot;, deemed &quot;BMX XXX&quot; and &quot;&quot; to be the &quot;two nails in Acclaim&#x27;s coffin&quot;. In 2015, the game was among several titles banned from streaming by Twitch. Todd Ciolek of &quot;IGN&quot;, in a retrospective feature covering major game publisher blunders, described &quot;BMX XXX&quot; as Acclaim&#x27;s &quot;last cry for attention&quot; in a series of desperate publicity stunts by the financially ailing company.

<doc id="351176" wikidata="Q1471089" url="?curid=351176" title="The Hardy Boys">
<text>The Hardy Boys, brothers Frank and Joe Hardy, are fictional characters who appear in a series of mystery novels for young readers. The series revolves around teenage amateur sleuths, solving cases that often stumped their adult counterparts. The characters were created by American writer Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of book packaging firm Stratemeyer Syndicate. The books were written by several ghostwriters, most notably Leslie McFarlane, under the collective pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon.

The Hardy Boys have evolved since their debut in 1927. From 1959 to 1973, the first 38 books were extensively revised to remove social and ethnic stereotypes, modernize content, and shorten the books.

A new &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; series, the &quot;Hardy Boys Casefiles&quot;, was created in 1987, and featured murders, violence, and international espionage. The original &quot;Hardy Boys Mystery Stories&quot; series ended in 2005. A new series, &quot;Undercover Brothers&quot;, was launched the same year, featuring updated versions of the characters who narrate their adventures in the first person. &quot;Undercover Brothers&quot; ended in 2012 and was replaced in 2013 by &quot;The Hardy Boys Adventures&quot;, also narrated in the first person.

Through these changes the characters have remained popular; several new volumes are published each year, and the adventures have been translated into over 25 languages. The boys have been featured in five television shows and several video games, and have helped promote merchandise such as lunchboxes and jeans. Critics have many explanations for the characters&#x27; longevity, suggesting that the Hardy Boys embody wish fulfillment, American ideals of boyhood and masculinity, a well-respected father paradoxically argued to be inept in the later books, and the possibility of the triumph of good over evil.

On January 1, 2023, the original editions of the first three books entered the public domain in the United States. Under current copyright laws, the revised editions will not be in the public domain in the United States until 2054.

==Premise==

The Hardy Boys, Frank and Joe Hardy, are fictional teenage brothers and amateur detectives. Frank is eighteen (sixteen in earlier versions), and Joe is seventeen (fifteen in earlier versions). They live in the city of Bayport on Barmet Bay with their father, detective Fenton Hardy; their mother, Laura Hardy; and their Aunt Gertrude. The brothers attend high school in Bayport, where they are in the same grade, but school is rarely mentioned in the books and never hinders their solving of mysteries. In the older stories, the Boys&#x27; mysteries are often linked to their father&#x27;s confidential cases. He sometimes requests their assistance, while at other times they stumble upon relevant villains and incidents. In the &quot;Undercover Brothers&quot; series (2005–2012), the Hardys are members of and receive cases from American Teens Against Crime. The Hardy Boys are sometimes assisted in solving mysteries by their friends Chet Morton, Phil Cohen, Biff Hooper, Jerry Gilroy, and Tony Prito; and, less frequently, by their platonic girlfriends Callie Shaw and Iola Morton (Chet&#x27;s sister).

In each novel, the Hardy Boys are constantly involved in adventure and action. Despite the frequent danger, the boys &quot;never lose their nerve ... They &quot;are&quot; hardy boys, luckier and more clever than anyone around them.&quot; They live in an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue: &quot;Never were so many assorted felonies committed in a simple American small town. Murder, drug peddling, race-horse kidnapping, diamond smuggling, bank robbing, kidnapping, dynamiting, burglaries, medical malpractice, big-time auto theft, even (in the 1940s) the hijacking of strategic materials and espionage, all were conducted with Bayport as a nucleus.&quot; With so much in common, the boys are so little differentiated that one commentator facetiously describes them thus: &quot;The boys&#x27; characters basically broke down this way – Frank had dark hair; Joe was blond.&quot; In general, however, &quot;Frank was the thinker while Joe was more impulsive, and perhaps a little more athletic.&quot; The two boys are invariably on good terms with each other and never engage in sibling rivalry, except in the &quot;Undercover Brothers&quot; series.

Frank and Joe are somewhat wealthy and often travel to far-away locations, including Mexico in &quot;The Mark on the Door&quot; (1934), Scotland in &quot;The Secret Agent on Flight 101&quot; (1967), Iceland in &quot;The Arctic Patrol Mystery&quot; (1969), Egypt in &quot;The Mummy Case&quot; (1980), and Kenya in &quot;The Mystery of the Black Rhino&quot; (2003). The Hardys also travel across the United States by motorcycle, motorboat, iceboat, train, airplane, and their own car.

==Creation of characters==
The characters were conceived in 1926 by Edward Stratemeyer, founder of book-packaging firm Stratemeyer Syndicate. Stratemeyer pitched the series to publishers Grosset &amp; Dunlap and suggested that the boys be called the Keene Boys, the Scott Boys, the Hart Boys, or the Bixby Boys. Grosset &amp; Dunlap editors approved the project, but, for reasons unknown, chose the name &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;. The first three titles were published in 1927 and were an immediate success: by mid-1929, more than 115,000 books had been sold. The series was so successful that Stratemeyer created Nancy Drew as a female counterpart to the Hardys.

===Ghostwriters===

Each volume is penned by a ghostwriter under the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon. In accordance with the customs of Stratemeyer Syndicate series production, ghostwriters for the Syndicate signed contracts that have sometimes been interpreted as requiring authors to sign away all rights to authorship or future royalties. The contracts stated that authors could not use their Stratemeyer Syndicate pseudonyms independently of the Syndicate. In the early days of the Syndicate, ghostwriters were paid a fee of $125, &quot;roughly equivalent to two months&#x27; wages for a typical newspaper reporter, the primary day job of the syndicate ghosts.&quot; During the Great Depression this fee was lowered, first to $100 and later to $75. All royalties went to the Syndicate; all correspondence with the publisher was handled through a Stratemeyer Syndicate office, and the Syndicate was able to enlist the cooperation of libraries in hiding the ghostwriters&#x27; names.

The Syndicate&#x27;s process for creating the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; books consisted of creating a detailed outline, with all elements of the plot; drafting a manuscript, and editing the manuscript. Edward Stratemeyer&#x27;s daughter, Edna Stratemeyer Squier, and possibly Stratemeyer himself, wrote outlines for the first volumes in the series. Beginning in 1934, Stratemeyer&#x27;s other daughter, Harriet Stratemeyer Adams, began contributing plot outlines; she and Andrew Svenson wrote most of the plot outlines for the next several decades. Other plot outliners included Vincent Buranelli, James Duncan Lawrence, and Tom Mulvey.

Most of the early volumes were written by Canadian Leslie McFarlane, who authored nineteen of the first twenty-five titles and co-authored volume 17 &quot;The Secret Warning&quot;, between 1927 and 1946. Unlike many other Syndicate ghostwriters, McFarlane was regarded highly enough by the Syndicate that he was frequently given advances of $25 or $50, and during the Depression, when fees were lowered, he was paid $85 for each Hardy Boys book when other Syndicate ghostwriters were receiving only $75 for their productions. According to McFarlane&#x27;s family, he despised the series and its characters.

After co-authoring Volume 17, John Button, with Volume 18, &quot;The Twisted Claw&quot; (1939), took over the series full-time until 1942; McFarlane resumed with Volume 22, &quot;The Flickering Torch Mystery&quot; (1943). McFarlane&#x27;s last contribution was Volume 24, &quot;The Short-Wave Mystery&quot; (1945); his wife, Amy, authored Volume 26, &quot;The Phantom Freighter&quot; (1947). Over the next several decades, other volumes were written by Adams, Svenson, Lawrence, Buranelli, William Dougherty, and James Buechler. Beginning in 1959, the series was extensively revised and re-written. Many authors worked on the revised books, writing new manuscripts; some of them also wrote plot outlines and edited the books. Among the authors who worked on the revised versions were Adams, Svenson, Buechler, Lilo Wuenn, Anne Shultes, Alistair Hunter, Tom Mulvey, Patricia Doll, and Priscilla Baker-Carr.

In 1979, the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; books began to be published in paperback rather than hardcover. Lawrence and Buranelli continued to write titles; other authors included Karl Harr III and Laurence Swinburne. In 1984, the rights to the series were sold, along with the Stratemeyer Syndicate, to Simon &amp; Schuster. New York book packager Mega-Books subsequently hired authors to write the &quot;Hardy Boys Mystery Stories&quot; and a new series, the &quot;Hardy Boys Casefiles&quot;.

===Legal disputes===
In 1980, dissatisfied with the lack of creative control at Grosset &amp; Dunlap and the lack of publicity for the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot;&#x27; 50th anniversary in 1977, Harriet Adams (née Stratemeyer) switched publishers for the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; and &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;, as well as other series, to Simon &amp; Schuster. Grosset &amp; Dunlap filed suit against the Syndicate and Simon &amp; Schuster, citing &quot;breach of contract, copyright infringement, and unfair competition&quot; and requesting $300 million in damages.

The outcome of the case turned largely on the question of who had written the &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; series. Adams filed a countersuit, claiming that, as the author of the &quot;Nancy Drew Mystery Stories&quot;, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; titles after 1953 and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles, but she was not the original author. When Mildred Benson, the author of the early &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; volumes, was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson&#x27;s role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams&#x27; claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series of both &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; and the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.

==Evolution of characters==
The Hardy Boys have gone through many permutations over the years. Beginning in 1959, the books were extensively revised, and some commentators find that the Hardys&#x27; characters changed in the process. Commentators also sometimes see differences between the Hardy Boys of the original &quot;Hardy Boys Mystery Stories&quot; and the Hardy Boys of the &quot;Hardy Boys Casefiles&quot; or the &quot;Undercover Brothers&quot; series.

===1927–1959===
The early volumes, largely written by Leslie McFarlane, have been praised for their atmosphere and writing style, qualities often considered lacking in juvenile series books. McFarlane&#x27;s writing is clear and filled with specific details, making his works superior to many other Stratemeyer series titles. Such, at least, was McFarlane&#x27;s intention: &quot;It seemed to me the Hardy Boys deserved something better than the slapdash treatment Dave Fearless had been getting... I opted for Quality.&quot; The volumes not written by McFarlane or his wife were penned by John Button, who wrote the series from 1938 to 1942; this period is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Weird Period&quot; as the writing is full of inconsistencies and the Hardy Boys&#x27; adventures involve futuristic gadgetry and exotic locations.

In general, the world of these early volumes is a &quot;[dark] and ... divided place.&quot; In these early titles, the boys are cynical about human nature, an attitude apparently justified when the police, whom they have repeatedly helped, throw them into jail on slim evidence in &quot;The Great Airport Mystery&quot; (1930). The police and authority figures, in general, come off poorly in these books, so much so that at one point Edward Stratemeyer wrote to McFarlane in order to reprimand him for a &quot;grievous lack of respect for officers of the law.&quot; The Hardys are less affluent than earlier Stratemeyer characters; they eagerly accept cash rewards largely to finance college educations, and, with their parents, strive to please their Aunt Gertrude, because she possesses a small fortune. The rich are portrayed as greedy and selfish. This view of the world reflects McFarlane&#x27;s relative &quot;lack [of] sympathy with the American power structure.&quot; In his autobiography, McFarlane described his rationale for writing the books this way, writing: &quot;I had my own thoughts about teaching youngsters that obedience to authority is somehow sacred... Would civilization crumble if kids got the notion that the people who ran the world were sometimes stupid, occasionally wrong, and even corrupt at times?&quot;

It has been a matter of disagreement regarding the treatment of minorities in the books. The early volumes have been called models of diversity for their day, since among the Hardys&#x27; friends are Phil Cohen, who is Jewish, and the Italian immigrant Tony Prito. These two friends are rarely involved in the Hardys&#x27; adventures, however. That level of friendship is reserved for Biff Hooper and Chet Morton. The books have been extensively criticized for their use of racial and ethnic stereotypes and their xenophobia. Vilnoff, for example, the villain in &quot;The Sinister Sign-Post&quot; (1936), is described as &quot;swarthy&quot; and &quot;a foreigner&quot;, notes critic Steve Burgess.

We sense his untrustworthy nature immediately when he sits down beside the boys at a football game and doesn&#x27;t understand it, despite the boys&#x27; best efforts to explain. When he does grasp something, you know it. &quot;I onnerstand pairfectly,&quot; he says. Later he adds genially, &quot;I haf you vhere I vant you now!&quot; Can&#x27;t quite place the accent? It&#x27;s foreign. Twenty-five chapters are not enough to solve the mystery of his nationality.

African Americans are the targets of much racism, being depicted as unintelligent, lazy, and superstitious, &quot;bumpkin rescuers&quot; at best and &quot;secretive and conspiratorial villains&quot; at worst. Benjamin Lefebvre notes that Harriet Adams at times rebuked Leslie McFarlane for not sufficiently following her instructions regarding the portrayal of African-American characters; he writes that it is not clear &quot;whether Adams rewrote parts of McFarlane&#x27;s manuscripts to add [racist] details or to what extent these early texts would now be considered even more notoriously racist had McFarlane followed Adams&#x27;s instructions more carefully.&quot; In &quot;Footprints Under the Window&quot; (1933), Chinese-American men are portrayed as effeminate threats both to national security and white heteromasculinity. Native Americans received mixed treatment; those living within the continental United States are portrayed as members of once-noble tribes whose greatness has been diminished by the coming of white men, while those living outside the continental U.S. are &quot;portrayed as uneducated, easily manipulated, or semi-savage.&quot; However, Hispanics are generally treated as equals; Mexico&#x27;s history and culture are treated with respect and admiration.

===1959–1979===
The &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; volumes were extensively revised beginning in 1959 at the insistence of publishers Grosset &amp; Dunlap, and against the wishes of Harriet Adams. The revision project, which also encompassed the &quot;Nancy Drew Mystery Stories&quot;, was sparked largely by letters that parents had been writing to Grosset &amp; Dunlap since at least 1948, complaining about the prevalence of racial stereotypes in the books. Volume 14 in the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; series, &quot;The Hidden Harbor Mystery&quot; (1935), was singled out for particular and repeated attention for its portrayal of a black criminal who organizes a gang of black boys and treats whites disrespectfully. As one parent put it, the books were &quot;ingraining the old race-riot type of fear.&quot; As such letters became more frequent, Grosset &amp; Dunlap informed the Stratemeyer Syndicate that the books must be revised and such stereotypes excised. The result, however, was less the removal of stereotypes than the removal of non-white characters altogether and the creation of an &quot;ethnically cleansed Bayport.&quot; By the 1970s, however, the series began to re-introduce black characters.

An additional rationale for the revisions was a drop in sales, which became particularly significant by the mid-1960s. Accordingly, the revisions focused on streamlining the texts, as well as eliminating stereotypes. The books were shortened from 25 chapters to 20 and the writing style was made terser. Difficult words such as &quot;ostensible&quot; and &quot;presaged&quot; were eliminated, as was slang. As a result of the new, more streamlined writing style, the books focus more on non-stop action than on building atmosphere, and &quot;prolonged suspense [is] evaporated.&quot; The books were also aimed at an increasingly younger audience with shorter attention spans. For this reason, many commentators find the new versions nothing less than &quot;eviscerated&quot;, foremost among them being the first &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; ghostwriter, Leslie McFarlane, who agreed with a reporter&#x27;s statement that the books had been &quot;gutted.&quot;

In the course of revising and modernizing the series, many plots were completely re-written. &quot;The Flickering Torch Mystery&quot; (1943), for example, was changed from a plot involving an actual flickering torch used as a signal by a gang to a plot featuring a rock club called &quot;The Flickering Torch.&quot; When plots were kept, their more lurid elements were eliminated; Vilnoff, the villain in &quot;The Sinister Sign-Post&quot;, was changed from a criminal who compulsively sculpts miniature models of his own hands to a car thief without such eccentricities, and another villain, Pedro Vincenzo, who branded his victims no longer does so in the revised version of &quot;The Mark on the Door&quot; (1934, rev. 1967).

The books became more respectful of law and authority. Even villains no longer smoked or drank, and scenes involving guns and shoot-outs were compressed or eliminated, in favor of criminals simply giving themselves up. The boys, too, become more respectful of rules and of the law; for example, they no longer drive faster than the speed limit even in pursuit of a villain. The Hardys also became more and more wealthy, prompting the criticism that the &quot;major problem in [these volumes] is that the Hardy Boys have risen above any ability to identify with people like the typical boys who read their books. They are members and agents of the adult ruling class, acting on behalf of that ruling class.&quot;

===1979–2005===

The &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; began to be published in paperback in 1979. The Hardys were also featured in two new series, the &quot;Hardy Boys Casefiles&quot; and the &quot;Clues Brothers&quot;. The latter series, modeled on the &quot;Nancy Drew Notebooks&quot;, was aimed at a younger audience, and ran from 1997 to 2000. In contrast, the &quot;Casefiles&quot;, begun a decade earlier in 1987, was aimed at an older audience than the &quot;Hardy Boys Mystery Stories&quot;. In the new series, the Hardys work with a secret government organization simply called the &quot;Network&quot;, with which they collaborate to &quot;infiltrate organized crime, battle terrorists and track down assassins around the world.&quot; The Hardys&#x27; personalities are portrayed as more separate and distinct, and they sometimes fight; in the first of the series, &quot;Dead on Target&quot;, for example, the brothers brawl after Frank tries to restrain Joe after Joe&#x27;s girlfriend, Iola Morton, is killed by a car bomb. In general, the series is more violent, and the Hardy Boys carry various guns; Lines like &quot;Joe! Hand me the Uzi!&quot; are not out of character. Barbara Steiner, a Casefiles ghostwriter, describes a sample plot outline: &quot;I was told that Joe Hardy would get involved with a waitress, a black widow kind of character, and that Joe would get arrested for murder. I was told the emphasis was on high action and suspense and there had to be a cliff-hanger ending to every chapter.&quot;

===2005===
The long-running &quot;Hardy Boys Mystery Stories&quot; series ended in 2005 and was replaced with a reboot series, &quot;The Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers&quot;. In these volumes, the Hardys&#x27; adventures are narrated in the first person, each brother alternating chapters. This fresh approach to telling the adventures reveals two boys quite foreign to how they have been portrayed before, egotistical and jealous, and longtime readers will find few connections with the boys&#x27; previous personalities. The boys&#x27; Aunt Gertrude becomes &quot;Trudy&quot;, their mother Laura is given a career as a librarian, and their father is semi-retired. The boys are given their cases by a secret group known as ATAC, an acronym for American Teens Against Crime. In this new series, the Hardy Boys seem &quot;more like regular kids – who have &quot;lots&quot; of wild adventures – in these books, which also deal with issues that kids today might have thought about. For example, the second book in the series, &quot;Running on Fumes&quot;, deals with environmentalists who go a little too far to try to save trees.&quot; The Hardys are also featured in a new graphic novel series, begun in 2005 and produced by Papercutz, and a new early chapter book series called &quot;The Hardy Boys: Secret Files&quot;, begun in 2010 by the publisher Simon &amp; Schuster under their Aladdin imprint. The last &quot;Undercover Brothers&quot; books were released in January 2012 (main series) and July 2012 (&quot;Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys Super Mystery &#x27;07&quot; series). At the time of cancellation, there was one book that had been announced, but was ultimately shelved (&quot;The Case Of The MyFace Kidnapper&quot;); it is unknown whether this was going to be the final title of this unpublished book, since many bookstore websites and Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s website always had the letters &quot;W.T.&quot; behind the title, meaning that it was a &quot;working title&quot;.

February 2013 saw the launch of &quot;The Hardy Boys Adventures&quot;, a series written in the first person. For the first time since 1985, the books are issued in hardcover, along with paperback editions.

==Books==
The longest-running series of books to feature the Hardy Boys is the &quot;Hardy Boys Mystery Stories&quot;, sometimes also called the &quot;Hardy Boys Mysteries&quot;. The series ran from 1927 to 2005 and comprises 190 volumes, although some consider only the first 58 volumes of this series to be part of the Hardy Boys &quot;canon.&quot; The Hardy Boys also appeared in 127 volumes of the &quot;Casefiles&quot; series and 39 volumes of the &quot;Undercover Brothers&quot; series, and are currently the heroes of the &quot;Hardy Boys Adventures&quot; series. The brothers were also featured in a few standalone books, such as &quot;The Hardy Boys Ghost Stories&quot;, and some crossover titles where they teamed up with other characters such as Nancy Drew or Tom Swift.

===International publications===
&quot;Hardy Boys&quot; books have been extensively reprinted in the United Kingdom, with new illustrations and cover art. The Hardys&#x27; adventures have also been translated into over twenty-five languages, including Afrikaans, Norwegian, Swedish, Spanish, Icelandic, Hebrew, French, German, Japanese, Russian, Malay, and Italian. The books are widely read in India, and Japan&#x27;s Kyoto Sangyo University listed twenty-one &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; books on its reading list for freshmen in the 1990s.

==Television==

There have been six separate &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; television adaptations.

In the late 1950s, Disney contracted with the Stratemeyer Syndicate and Grosset &amp; Dunlap to produce two &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; TV serials, starring Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk. The first of the serials, &quot;The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure&quot;, was aired on &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; in 1956 during the show&#x27;s second season. To appeal to the show&#x27;s audience, the Hardy Boys were portrayed as younger than in the books, seeming to be 12 or 13 years old (Considine was 15 and Kirk was 14 during filming). The script, written by Jackson Gillis, was based on the first &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; book, &quot;The Tower Treasure&quot;, and the serial was aired in 19 episodes of 15 minutes each with production costs of $5,700. A second serial, &quot;The Mystery of Ghost Farm&quot;, followed in 1957, with an original story by Jackson Gillis. However, for unknown reasons, no more serials were produced.

In the mid-1960s, sales of &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; books began to drop. The Stratemeyer Syndicate conducted a survey, which revealed that the decline in sales was due to the perceived high cost of the books and to competition from television. As a result, the Syndicate approved an hour-long pilot for a new Hardy Boys television show. The pilot, based on &quot;The Mystery of the Chinese Junk&quot;, was aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on September 8, 1967, and starred Tim Matthieson (later Matheson) as Joe Hardy and Rick Gates as Frank. Both actors were 20 at the time of production and portrayed the Hardy Boys as young adults rather than children. The show did poorly, however, and the series was abandoned.

Two years later, in 1969, the American Broadcasting Company aired a Saturday morning cartoon series based on the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot;; the series was produced by Filmation and ran from 1969 to 1971. In this series, the Hardys were members of a rock and roll band. A group of professional musicians performed all the songs on the series and toured across the United States. The animated series produced two bubblegum music albums &quot;of moderate quality with no commercial success.&quot; The series was notable for being the first cartoon to include a black character. The show took note of current concerns; although aimed at a young audience, some plot lines dealt with illegal drugs, and the animated Frank and Joe spoke directly to children about not smoking and the importance of wearing seat belts.

ABC aired another series featuring the Hardy Boys, &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, from 1977 to 1979. The prime-time series starred Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy as Frank and Joe Hardy; Pamela Sue Martin and later Janet Louise Johnson played Nancy Drew. During the first season, the series alternated between episodes featuring the Hardy Boys one week and Nancy Drew the next. The Hardy Boys were cast as young adults (Stevenson and Cassidy were 24 and 18, respectively, during the filming of the first episodes). The series featured original plots as well as ones based on &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; books, among them &quot;The Clue of the Screeching Owl&quot;, &quot;The Disappearing Floor&quot; and &quot;The Flickering Torch Mystery&quot;. The series received an Emmy nomination and featured a number of guest stars, including Kim Cattrall, Ray Milland, Howard Duff, and Ricky Nelson. During the second season, the series format changed to focus more on the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew appearing mostly in crossover episodes with the brothers; midway through production of the second season, Martin quit and was replaced by Johnson. The series returned for a third season, dropping the Nancy Drew character completely and shortening its title to &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;.

In 1995, another TV adaptation, simply called &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;, was produced by Canadian company Nelvana (normally an animation firm), syndicated by New Line Television, and dubbed in French for airing in Quebec and France as well as in the United States. Colin Gray starred as Frank Hardy and Paul Popowich played Joe. The characters were portrayed as in their early 20s, with Frank working as a reporter and Joe still in college. The show lasted for only one season of 13 episodes due to poor ratings; a series based on &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; that ran alongside it in syndication suffered the same fate.

&quot;The Hardy Boys&quot; streaming series is a teen and young adult-oriented drama starring Rohan Campbell as Frank and Alexander Elliot as Joe released on December 4, 2020, by Hulu with Joan Lambur and Steve Cochrane executive producing the series and Jason Stone directing. Shot in Toronto, Hamilton, and other Southern Ontario locations, the 13 episodes were released on Hulu on December 4, 2020, in the United States and aired on YTV in Canada in 2021. Season 2 premiered in 2022.

== Comic book ==
In 1970 and 1972, Gold Key Comics put out four comic-book issues tied to the 1969/71 television series.

In March 2017, Dynamite Entertainment released Anthony Del Col’s reboot of classic characters Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys with &quot;Nancy Drew &amp; The Hardy Boys: The Big Lie&quot;. Del Col has been a lifelong fan of the characters and was successful in working with Simon &amp; Schuster to secure the comic book rights and then pitch to publishers.

Inspired by Archie Comics’ &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot;, Del Col said, &quot;So, then I started to think, &#x27;Huh, I wonder what other characters are out there that are well-known that could be rebooted like that.&#x27; That&#x27;s when I started to look around and I looked in some properties, and then I thought, &#x27;Wait a minute. Nancy Drew. Hardy Boys. Oh, that would be really cool to do a hard-boiled noir take on them.

The series, a hardboiled noir take on the characters, finds characters Frank and Joe Hardy accused of murdering their father, Fenton Hardy, and turning to a femme fatale-esque Nancy Drew to clear their names. The series features artwork by Italian artist Werther Dell’Ederra with covers by UK artist Fay Dalton. Del Col credits editors Matt Idelson and Matt Humphreys with helping him shape the direction of the series.

The series debuted to positive reviews. Comics blog Readingwithaflightring.com declared it “the best &#x27;modern&#x27; approach to updating a franchise like this that I’ve seen. It works on every level and still fully embraces the heart of who they are.&quot; Aintitcool.com reviewer Lyz Reblin stated, “The strength of the series thus far is Ms. Drew, who was absent for most of the first issue. She is a pitch-perfect modernized femme fatale, who could hold her own up against any present-day Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, or the like.”

==In other media==
* The Hardy Boys have appeared in several titles in the &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; computer game series produced by Her Interactive. Her Interactive partnered with Sega to release its own series of &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; games. The first game in the series is titled &quot;Treasure on the Tracks&quot; and was released in 2009 for Nintendo DS.
* JoWood Productions and DreamCatcher Games have released a &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; computer game called &quot;The Hidden Theft&quot;. Jesse McCartney and Cody Linley are the voices of Frank and Joe.
* The Hardy Boys have been used to sell a variety of merchandise over the years, much of it tied to television adaptations. They have appeared in several board games, comic books, coloring books, activity books, jigsaw puzzles, and lunch boxes; two LP albums, &quot;Here Come the Hardy Boys&quot; and &quot;Wheels&quot;; a Viewmaster set, a toy truck, charm bracelets, rings, wristwatches, greeting cards, jeans, and guitars.
* The Hardy Boys have been parodied in the animated series &quot;South Park&quot; in an episode titled &quot;Mystery of the Urinal Deuce&quot;, in which the &quot;Hardly Boys&quot; investigate a 9/11 conspiracy theory.
* The Hardy Boys &quot;Mystery of the Spiral Bridge&quot; appears in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;In The Blood&quot;, as a book that belonged to Agent Dwayne Pride in the past.
* There have been three Hardy Boys games. &quot;The Hardy Boys Treasure Game&quot; by Parker Brothers is from 1957. &quot;The Hardy Boys Game&quot;, by Milton Bradley in 1969, is based on the cartoon. In 1978, Parker Brothers released &quot;The Hardy Boys Mystery Game&quot;, based on the television series. In the board game, two to four players take on the role of amateur sleuths and try to solve a mystery.
* 2019 video game &quot;Disco Elysium&quot; features a group of characters known as the &quot;Hardie Boys&quot; led by Titus Hardie that act as minor antagonists. The Hardie Boys are not investigators but a group of union-backed dockworkers who act as vigilantes and claim to have murdered another during the course of the game.

==Thematic analysis==
The Hardy Boys have been called &quot;a cultural touchstone all over the world.&quot; Their adventures have been continuously in print since 1927. The series was an instant success: by mid-1929 over 115,000 books had been sold. As of 2008, the series remained successful, with the first &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; book, &quot;The Tower Treasure&quot;, selling over 100,000 copies a year. Worldwide, over 70 million copies of Hardy Books have been sold. A number of critics have tried to explain the reasons for the characters&#x27; longevity.

One explanation for this continuing popularity is that the Hardy Boys are simple wish fulfillment. Their adventures allow readers to vicariously experience an escape from the mundane. At the same time, Frank and Joe live ordinary lives when not solving mysteries, allowing readers to identify with characters who seem realistic and whose parents and authority figures are unfailingly supportive and loving. The Hardy Boys also embody an ideal of masculinity: by their very name they &quot;set the stage for a gentrified version of hardiness and constructed hardiness as an ideal for modern American males&quot;, part of the &quot;cultural production of self-control and mastery as the revered ideal for the American man.&quot; More controversially, to Meredith Wood, the characters embody not just an ideal of masculinity, but an ideal of white masculinity. She argues that &quot;racist stereotypes are ... fundamental to the success of the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; series.&quot; In support of this claim, Wood cites what she says is the replacement of one stereotype (evil Chinese) with another (evil Latin Americans) in the original and revised versions of &quot;Footprints Under the Window&quot;. She further claims that this is the reason for the popularity of the Applewood Books reprints of the original, unrevised texts rather than the widely cited blandness of the rewrites.

Critic Gary Westfahl considers the Hardy Boys to not display any sexuality. The Hardys&#x27; ignorance of sex and their increasing respect for the law have led to some negative perceptions and many parodies of the characters. They are &quot;well-scrubbed Boy Scout types&quot; who &quot;fetishized squareness.&quot; They have been parodied numerous times, in such works as &quot;The Hardy Boys and the Mystery of Where Babies Come From&quot; by Christopher Durang, &quot;The Secret of the Old Queen: A Hardy Boys Musical&quot; by Timothy Cope and Paul Boesing, and Mabel Maney&#x27;s novel &quot;A Ghost in the Closet: A Hardly Boys Mystery&quot;. &quot;National Lampoon&quot; ran an article in 1985 entitled &quot;The Undiscovered Notebooks of Franklin W. Dixon&quot;, in which the authors &quot;purport to have stumbled upon some unpublished &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; manuscripts&quot;, including &quot;The Party Boys and the Case of the Missing Scotch&quot; and &quot;The Hardly Boys in the Dark Secret of the Spooky Closet.&quot;

Others have pointed to the Hardy Boys&#x27; relationship with their father as a key to the success of the series. As Tim Morris notes, while Fenton Hardy is portrayed as a great detective, his sons are usually the ones that solve cases, making Fenton Hardy a paradoxical figure:

He is always there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is typically emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He can take on any shape but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except for the one he&#x27;s working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; novel begins, which is of course the only time we ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn&#x27;t mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.

As a result, the Hardy Boys are able both to be superior to their father and to gain the satisfaction of &quot;fearlessly making their dad proud of them.&quot;

In the end, many commentators find that the Hardy Boys are largely successful because their adventures represent &quot;a victory over anxiety.&quot; The &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; series teaches readers that &quot;although the world can be an out-of-control place, good &quot;can&quot; triumph over evil, that the worst problems can be solved if we each do our share and our best to help others.&quot;

<text>The cutlassfishes are about 45 species of predatory ray-finned fish in the family Trichiuridae of the order Scombriformes found in seas throughout the world. Fish of this family are long, slender, and generally steely blue or silver in colour, giving rise to their name. They have reduced or absent pelvic and caudal fins, giving them an eel-like appearance, and large fang-like teeth.

Some of the species are known as scabbardfishes or hairtails; others are called frostfishes because they appear in late autumn and early winter, around the time of the first frosts.

<doc id="351183" wikidata="Q52659" url="?curid=351183" title="Peter Snell">
<text>Sir Peter George Snell (17 December 1938 – 12 December 2019) was a New Zealand middle-distance runner. He won three Olympic gold medals, and is the only man since 1920 to have won the 800 and 1500 metres at the same Olympics, in 1964.

Snell had a relatively short career as a world-famous international sportsman, 1960–1965, yet achieved so much that he was voted New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;Sports Champion of the (20th) Century&quot; and was one of 24 inaugural members of the International Association of Athletics Federations Hall of Fame named in 2012. A protégé of the New Zealand athletics coach Arthur Lydiard, Snell is known for the three Olympic and two Commonwealth Games gold medals he won, and the several world records he set.

== Early athletic career ==
Born in Ōpunake, Snell moved with his family to Waikato in 1949 where he attended Te Aroha College and became an all-around sportsman. He won several middle-distance running events in his hometown of Te Aroha, although some members of his new school lived in Ngāruawāhia. In 1955 he became a boarding student at Mount Albert Grammar School in Auckland, where he took up a wide range of team and individual sports, including rugby union, cricket, tennis, badminton, and golf. As a teenager, Snell excelled in tennis, and pursued the sport through appearances at the Auckland and New Zealand Junior Tennis Championships.

At age 19, Snell was motivated to concentrate seriously on running by the comments of his future coach, Arthur Lydiard, who told him, &quot;Peter, with the sort of speed you&#x27;ve got, if you do the endurance training, you could be one of our best middle-distance runners.&quot; During his early career under the tutelage of Lydiard, he started with New Zealand titles and records for 880 yards and the mile, despite being an unusually large and powerful man by typical middle-distance runner standards.

== Olympic success ==
Snell came to international attention with his gold medal in the 800 metres at the Rome Olympics in 1960, setting a new national record. He was particularly dominant four years later at the Tokyo Olympics where he won the gold and set a new Olympic record in the and won gold in the 1500 metres.

By winning the 800–1500 m double, Snell became only the second male to achieve this feat at the Olympics after Albert Hill in 1920, and it has not been achieved by any male athlete at the Olympics since. It was not achieved by a male at an open global championship until Moroccan-born Rashid Ramzi of Bahrain won both golds at the World Championships in 2005 at Helsinki. (After the 2008 Olympic Games, Ramzi was stripped of his Olympic gold medal for doping, but that penalty was not applied retroactively to his World Championship gold medals.)

== World records ==
In early 1962, Snell lowered the world mile record by a tenth of a second at Cooks Gardens in Whanganui on and one week later set new world records for both the 800 m and at He then won gold and set a new record for 880 yd at the Commonwealth Games in Perth in 1962, and won gold for the mile at those same games. In all, Snell set five individual world records and joined fellow New Zealand athletes to set a new four by one mile relay record as well.

Snell&#x27;s 800 m time of 1:44.3, set on 3 February 1962, remained the world record until Marcello Fiasconaro ran 1:43.7 on 27 June 1973. It was the Oceania area record until Joseph Deng ran 1:44.21 on 20 July 2018. It was also the oldest national record recognised by the IAAF for a standard track and field event, lasting for 62 years until James Preston ran 1:44.04 on 25 May 2024, five years after Snell&#x27;s death. His time remains the fastest ever run over that distance on a grass track.

Fatigued after his Olympic buildup and second world mile record in 1964, his final track season in 1965 was characterized by a string of losses to such athletes as Olympic 1500 m silver medalist Josef Odlozil, Olympic 800 m silver medalist Bill Crothers, U.S. high schooler and future world record holder Jim Ryun, and the American Jim Grelle. Snell then announced his retirement.

== Career after retirement from sport ==
Snell worked for a tobacco company and lived in Mount Albert, before moving to the United States of America in 1971 to further his education. He gained a B.S. in human performance from the University of California, Davis, and then a PhD in exercise physiology from Washington State University. He joined University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas as a research fellow in 1981. He was associate professor, Department of Internal Medicine and also director of their Human Performance Centre. A member of the American College of Sports Medicine, Snell was honoured in 1999 as an Inaugural Inductee, International Scholar, into the Athlete Hall of Fame, University of Rhode Island.

Adopting a new sport, Snell became an orienteer and won his category, men aged 65 and older, in the 2003 United States Orienteering Championship. He was a past president of the North Texas Orienteering Association and a member of the United States Orienteering Federation.

Snell also became a competitive table tennis player including competing in Texas state (finishing in the top 4 in the 75+ age category) and U.S. championship events and also the 2017 World Masters Games in Auckland.

Snell died at his home in Dallas, US on 12 December 2019, just five days short of turning 81. The cause was heart failure. Miki, his wife, survived him.

==Commemorations and awards==

Following his success at the Perth Commonwealth Games in 1962, Snell was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services in the field of athletics in the 1962 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. Three years later he was elevated to Officer of the same order in the 1965 New Year Honours.

He was voted New Zealand&#x27;s Sports Champion of the Century in 2000 and was knighted soon afterwards. In the 2002 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to sport, and in 2009, following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government, he accepted redesignation as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit and was invested by the Governor-General of New Zealand, Sir Anand Satyanand.

Snell was one of five Olympic athletes from New Zealand featured on a series of commemorative postage stamps issued in August 2004 to commemorate the 2004 Olympic Games. The two dollar stamp issued by New Zealand Post features a stylised photo of Snell snapping the tape at the finish line of the 800 metres race at the 1960 Olympics in Rome.

He was selected by &quot;Track and Field News&quot;&#x27; as their &quot;Athlete of the &#x27;60&#x27;s&quot; and was pictured on the cover of the December 1969 issue.
In 2007 he was awarded an honorary doctorate (DSc) by Massey University in recognition of his work as an exercise physiologist.

A larger than life-size bronze statue of Peter Snell was erected in his hometown of Ōpunake, Taranaki, and was unveiled on 19 May 2007. The statue is based on a photo of Snell crossing the finish line in the historic race at Wanganui&#x27;s Cook&#x27;s Gardens in 1962. A similar bronze statue of Snell was unveiled in Cook&#x27;s Gardens on 15 August 2009 to commemorate his athletic achievements.

Interviewed by the &quot;Wanganui Chronicle&quot; after the unveiling, Snell said he was internationally known as a miler, but he had never reached his potential over the mile and the 800 metres was probably his best distance. He said his greatest effort was the world 800m/880yard double record set on Lancaster Park a few days after his new mile record, with an 800m time that would have won the gold medal 46 years later at the Beijing Olympics.

Snell was inducted into the Taranaki Sports Hall of Fame at the Taranaki Sports Awards 2021.

==Honorific eponyms==
In 2001, Macleans College in Auckland created Snell House as part of its &quot;whanau house&quot; system.

The Peter Snell Youth Village, on the Whangaparaoa Peninsula, in North Auckland, is also named after him. They run holiday camps for young people.

Snell Drive, in the Hamilton suburb of Chartwell, is named in Snell&#x27;s honour.

Peter Snell Street is a street in the Bay of Plenty town of Whakatāne.
Peter Snell Drive is the location of Bream Bay College in Ruakaka in Te Tai Tokerau Northland.

<text>Palliser&#x27;s Triangle (), or the Palliser Triangle, is a semi-arid steppe occupying a substantial portion of the Western Canadian Canadian Prairies, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba, within the Great Plains region. While initially determined to be unsuitable for crops outside of the fertile belt due to arid conditions and dry climate, expansionists questioned this assessment, leading to homesteading in the Triangle. Agriculture in the region has since suffered from frequent droughts and other such hindrances.

== History ==
Before Western European interests and settlement expanded to the region, Palliser&#x27;s Triangle was inhabited by a variety of Indigenous peoples, such as the Cree, Sioux, and the Blackfoot Confederacy. Their lifestyle was centred around the buffalo hunt, as the bountiful herds of buffalo made this a sustainable and effective means of feeding themselves, the meat of which was used to make pemmican. By the mid-1850s, however, the hunt had become an economic venture, their hides and meat sold by Métis and First Nations hunters to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), and the increased demand led to a decline in herds.

In the middle of the 19th century, a large variety of factors contributed to an increase in Canadian expansionism, and eyes fell upon what would become western Canada for this purpose given that the cold and uncultivatable Canadian Shield was found in the north whereas the expanding United States controlled the south. This American expansionism also drove Canadian expansionism due to the fear that the United States would look north and lay claim to the land before they could. With this said, it became apparent that no sources existed that had a full and reliable assessment of the land. While the HBC had a working knowledge of the land inasmuch as it was useful to their end and business interests, it was insufficient to the needs of the Canadian government. In addition, the HBC was hesitant to share information about the land they controlled for the sake of protecting their monopoly in the region. Even the Royal Geographical Society was uninformed about the North West. All the above drove the United Kingdom and the Dominion of Canada to organize the Palliser and Hind expeditions, respectively, especially since the 1840s discovery that latitude alone did not determine climate, which in turn suggested that good farmland may exist in the region.

The area was named after John Palliser, the leader of the aforementioned British Palliser expedition into Western Canada from 1857 to 1859. The expedition had the objective of spending two or three seasons:
#&quot;In examining &quot;the region along the Southern frontier of our territories, between the parallels of 49° and 53° north latitude, and from 100° to 115° west longitude&quot; with a view to surveying &quot;the watershed between the basins of the Missouri and the Saskachewan [sic]; also the course of the south branch of the Saskachewan and its tributaries; and... the actual line of the frontier, on the parallel of 49°&quot;;&quot;
#&quot;In exploring &quot;the Rocky Mountains, for the purpose of ascertaining the most southerly pass across to the Pacific, within the British Territory&quot; since the well-known Athabasca Portage was too far north and &quot;totally useless&quot; for horses;&quot;
#&quot;In reporting on &quot;the natural features and general capabilities of the country&quot; and mapping it. The R.G.S. also advised that scientific assistants should accompany Palliser.&quot;
The expeditions came to the conclusion that what would become western Canada was divided into three regions: a northern cold zone that was inhospitable to agriculture, Palliser&#x27;s Triangle towards the south which Palliser characterized as an extension of the American Great Plains which he described as being &quot;a more or less arid&quot; desert and thus unsuitable for crops albeit acceptable for livestock given the “dry climate, sandy soil, and extensive grass cover,&quot; and a rich fertile belt in the middle that was ideally suited to agriculture and settlement, the existence of which was confirmed by both Palliser, and Henry Youle Hind, of Hind Expedition fame. They both argued against settling within the arid body of the Triangle. This changed perceptions of the region: previously seen as untamed wilderness, the British Canadian public began to see potential farmland in the Triangle. The prospect of an ample supply of fertile land lit a fire under Canadian expansionists, and the Canadian government started to buy up HBC land in the region as they were under pressure to ensure that it would be Canadians who settled the North West, not Americans. This began with the purchase of Rupert&#x27;s Land for £300,000. This wellspring of expansionism came with the idea of a &quot;Canadian Empire&quot; of which the North West was a part of, in defiance of the idea that these lands were those of the First Nations and Métis who inhabited them at the time.

In this period of expansionism, one prominent figure advocating homesteading in the North West was botanist John Macoun. He undertook expeditions alongside Sir Sanford Fleming in the 1880s during which he had the chance to look at the ostensibly uncultivatable Palliser&#x27;s Triangle. It turns out that Palliser saw the region in a state of drought during which ample buffalo herds were grazing the grass shorter. He also bore witness to a number of grass fires, all of which gave the impression of an inhospitable desert. Macoun, on the other hand, found the region in a major wet period after a severe decline in animal life in no small part due to the overhunting of bison. This skewed his perspective to the exact opposite of Palliser&#x27;s assessment: where Palliser could be said to have underestimated the agricultural capacity of the Triangle, Macoun could be said to have overestimated it, as evidenced by both the region&#x27;s production and its frequent and sometimes devastating droughts.

With Macoun&#x27;s assessment in hand, the Canadian government undertook an advertising campaign to encourage European immigration to western Canada, which was joined by the distribution of 160-acre tracts of farmland for a token fee of ten dollars under the federal &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot;. In addition, the planned Canadian Pacific Railway was moved southwards from its original route through the Parklands to instead pass through Palliser&#x27;s Triangle for the sake of facilitating homesteading and grain shipment, thus further encouraging settlement in the region. Were it not for this fact, it is very likely that cities such as Calgary, Brandon and Regina would not exist as they do today.

Many farmers who did settle in the semi-arid portion of the Triangle between the period of the expedition and 1914 saw success, especially as the demand for wheat was driven up by the outbreak of the First World War, though many others were forced to partake in wage labour as hired farmhands, members of itinerant threshing crews, or manual labour for road and rail construction companies, logging camps and mining towns, to continue sustaining their farms. Furthermore, the influx of agricultural technology on larger farms that came with the wartime boon such as tractors, combines and trucks all cut labour requirements on larger farms and increased the capital needed to establish oneself as a farmer, further hampering smaller farms. The loss of employment opportunities was further compounded in the 1930s as the government completed rail and road projects, in addition to the cutting of government work budgets.

During the Great Depression the Triangle, like much of the Canadian and American Prairies, was struck by the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. This was caused, in large part, by a decrease in precipitation as well as longstanding flawed farming practices that exacerbated aeolian soil erosion and dust storm activity. This includes the practice of leaving fields fallow, seen as necessary at the time to support agriculture in the given climate, as it was believed that exposed soil would better absorb and retain moisture. Measures undertaken in Alberta and Saskatchewan have since alleviated many of these issues. The Alberta government had the Special Areas Board buy up as much drought-afflicted farmland as possible to convert to grazing land, 2.1 million hectares of which it still administers. Both provincial governments subsidized the relocation of farmers willing to leave their farms in the drought-stricken regions, and the federal government established the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration in 1935, an organization that expanded on government research into soil erosion, carried out soil surveys, encouraged farmers to adopt soil conservation measures and new farming practices, and established shelterbelts and community pastures.

==Modern agriculture==
This area was and is still very productive in terms of both produce and livestock. Alberta and Saskatchewan are currently the provinces with the second and third most farms, respectively, only being surpassed in this respect by much more populous Ontario. This is despite the fact that Palliser&#x27;s Triangle, which occupies much of the southern portions of both of these provinces, has had consistent issues with droughts, almost every decade being marked by at least one dry year, in no small part due to the orographic lift caused by the Rockies, the Coast Mountains, the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada Range. This has much to do with efforts to maintain sustained agricultural practices such as crop diversification and conservation tillage which have softened the blow of complications that could have otherwise had far more severe effects.

Saskatchewan is currently the province with the largest amount of farmland, and the leading crops are canola, spring wheat and lentils. Cattle are also a major player in the farming economy, given that Saskatchewan has the second highest number of cattle of all the Canadian provinces. The reverse is true in Alberta, which has the second largest total farmland and the highest number of cattle. This Western Canadian agriculture is noticeably focused in the Palliser&#x27;s Triangle region, demonstrating that agriculture in the area has persisted in spite of the dry climate.

Despite the frequent and sometimes disastrous droughts, the Triangle did become and still is the metaphorical breadbasket of the nation as he expected. However, the region has also suffered a major loss in terms of biodiversity over the course of settlement. Canada as a whole has found itself with under 20% of its mixed grass prairies, under 5% of its fescue prairies, and less than a half-percent of its tall grass prairies. In addition, the prairies have a very high rate of endangered species.

In one form, product activation refers to a method invented by Ric Richardson and patented () by Uniloc where a software application hashes hardware serial numbers and an ID number specific to the product&#x27;s license (a product key) to generate a unique installation ID. This installation ID is sent to the manufacturer to verify the authenticity of the product key and to ensure that the product key is not being used for multiple installations.

Alternatively, the software vendor sends the user a unique product serial number. When the user installs the application it requests that the user enter their product serial number, and checks it with the vendor&#x27;s systems over the Internet. The application obtains the license limits that apply to that user&#x27;s license, such as a time limit or enabling of product features, from the vendor&#x27;s system and optionally also locks the license to the user&#x27;s system. Once activated the license continues working on the user&#x27;s machine with no further communication required with the vendor&#x27;s systems. Some activation systems also support activation on user systems without Internet connections; a common approach is to exchange encrypted files at an Internet terminal.

An early example of product activation was in the MS-DOS program D&#x27;Bridge Email System written by Chris Irwin, a commercial network system for BBS users and Fidonet. The program generated a unique serial number which then called the author&#x27;s BBS via a dialup modem connection. Upon connection, the serial number was validated. A unique &quot;key&quot; was returned which allowed the program to continue for a trial period. If two D&#x27;Bridge systems communicated using the same key, the software deliberately crashed. The software has long since had the entire activation system removed and is now freeware by Nick J. Andre, Ltd.

===Microsoft===
Microsoft Product Activation was introduced in the Brazilian version of Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition and Microsoft Word 97 sold in the Hungarian market. It broadened that successful pilot with the release of Microsoft Publisher 98 in the Brazilian market. Microsoft then rolled out product activation in its flagship Microsoft Office 2000 product. All retail copies sold in Australia, Brazil, China, France, and New Zealand, and some sold in Canada and the United States, required the user to activate the product via the Internet. However, all copies of Office 2000 do not require activation after April 15, 2003. After its success, the product activation system was extended worldwide and incorporated into Windows XP and Office XP and all subsequent versions of Windows and Office. Despite independently developing its own technology, in April 2009 a jury found Microsoft to have willfully infringed Uniloc&#x27;s patent. However, in September 2009, US District Judge William Smith &quot;vacated&quot; the jury&#x27;s verdict and ruled in favour of Microsoft. This ruling was subsequently overturned in 2011.

==Blocking==
Software that has been installed but not activated does not perform its full functions, and/or imposes limits on file size or session time. Some software allows full functionality for a limited &quot;trial&quot; time before requiring activation. Unactivated software typically reminds the user to activate, at program startup or at intervals, and when the imposed size or time limits are reached. (Some unactivated software has taken disruptive actions such as crashing or vandalism, but this is rare.)

Some &#x27;unactivated&#x27; products act as a time-limited trial until a product key—a number encoded as a sequence of alphanumeric characters—is purchased and used to activate the software. Some products allow licenses to be transferred from one machine to another using online tools, without having to call technical support to deactivate the copy on the old machine before reactivating it on the new machine.

Software verifies activation every time it starts up, and sometimes while it is running. Some software even &quot;phones home&quot;, checking a central database (across the Internet or other means) to check whether the specific activation has been revoked. Some software might stop working or reduce functionality if it cannot connect to the central database.

==Criticisms==
*It can enforce software license agreement restrictions that may be legally invalid. For example, a company may refuse to reactivate software on an upgraded or new PC, even if the user may have a legal right to use the product under such circumstances.
*If the company ceases to support a specific product, goes out of business due to insolvency or consolidation, its purchased product may become unusable or incapable of being (re)installed unless an activation-free copy or final patch that removes or bypasses activation is released.
*Product activation where there is no straightforward way to transfer the license to another person to activate on their computer has been widely criticised as making second-hand sales of products, particularly games, very difficult. Some suspect companies such as EA to be using product activation to reduce second-hand sales of their games in order to increase sales of new copies.
*As the transfer of an activation request usually happens encrypted or at least obfuscated, the user cannot see or check if additional data from his/her machine gets transferred, creating privacy concerns.
*Malfunction of the activating mechanism can delay users from getting started using newly-licensed software.
*Malfunction of the verification mechanism can cause vital software to suddenly stop working until re-activated or patched. This can happen in response to detected changes of installed hardware, or other software, of the operating system.

<doc id="351192" wikidata="Q221001" url="?curid=351192" title="Jacques Anquetil">
<text>Jacques Anquetil (; 8 January 1934 – 18 November 1987) was a French road racing cyclist and the first cyclist to win the Tour de France five times, in 1957 and from 1961 to 1964.

He stated before the 1961 Tour that he would gain the yellow jersey on day one and wear it all through the tour, a tall order with two previous winners in the field—Charly Gaul and Federico Bahamontes—but he did it. His victories in stage races such as the Tour were built on an exceptional ability to ride alone against the clock in individual time trial stages, which lent him the name &quot;Monsieur Chrono&quot;.

He won eight Grand Tours in his career, which was a record when he retired and has only since been surpassed by Eddy Merckx and Bernard Hinault.

== Early life ==
Anquetil was born on 8 January 1934 in a clinic in Mont-Saint-Aignan, a suburb of Rouen in Normandy situated next to Bois-Guillaume, where his parents had a house at the time. His father Ernest was the grandson of a Prussian soldier called Ernst, who died in the Franco-Prussian War after having an affair with Melanie Grouh, Ernest&#x27;s grandmother. Melanie later married Frédéric Anquetil, who adopted her son Ernest Victor, Jacques&#x27; grandfather, who would later die in World War I, leaving Jacques&#x27; father Ernest as the head of the family at the age of 11. On 25 May 1929, Ernest married Jacques&#x27; mother Marie, who had been orphaned since the age of 2 and been raised by nuns in an orphanage. Jacques had a younger brother, Philippe.

Anquetil received his first bike from his father at the age of 4. When Jacques was seven, his father Ernest returned from his service in World War II and, unable to find building work except for the German occupying forces, moved with the family to Le Bourguet close to Quincampoix to become a strawberry farmer. It was here that the young Anquetil attended school, receiving good grades, particularly in mathematics. Ernest Anquetil often became violent after excess alcohol consumption, and Jacques&#x27; mother eventually moved into an apartment in Paris, leaving her sons with their father. As his second bike grew too small for him, Anquetil needed a new one at the age of 11. With his father being unable to afford it, Jacques argued successfully to allow him to replace one of the workers on the strawberry fields, earning him the necessary money to buy a Stella bicycle on his own. At the age of 14, he began to attend Technical College in Rouen&#x27;s southern district of Sotteville to become a metalworker. It was here that he met and befriended Maurice Dieulois, who rode amateur bike races on the weekends and whose father had been president of the local cycling club AC Sottevillais. Through him, Anquetil got into bicycle racing, signing up to the club under the tutelage of André Boucher late in the summer of 1950. Since it was too late to participate in any more races that year, he instead focussed on getting into shape for the coming season. Boucher recognized Anquetil&#x27;s talent and offered him two bikes, one for training and one for races, as well as free supply of tyres, bike maintenance and a performance bonus. At the end of 1950, Anquetil gained his diploma and by the end of January 1951 had taken a job in a workshop in Sotteville, for a meager pay of 64 francs an hour. Since his employer would not allow him Thursday evening off, which the club used for training rides, he quit his position at the beginning of March, moving back to working on his father&#x27;s farm while pursuing a career in cycling.

==Amateur career==
Anquetil&#x27;s first race as an amateur was in Le Havre on 8 April 1951. While Dieulois won, Anquetil finished in the field. He took his first victory in his fourth race, the Grand Prix Maurice Latour on 3 May of the same year. Over the remaining course of the season, he won a total of eight races, including winning the Normandy team time trial championships with his teammates in July. Ending the season was his first ever individual time trial, which was also the last race of the season-long &quot;maillot des jeunes&quot; competition for local amateur riders. Setting off last as the leader of the competition, four minutes after Dieulois, Anquetil showed reluctance to catch and overtake his friend, but eventually did so, winning both the race and the competition as a whole.

For his second amateur season in 1952, Anquetil moved up from the junior into the senior ranks. The year produced another eleven victories and five more top-three placings. During the regional championship race for Normandy, he was marked the entire race by rival riders from the powerful cycling club from Caen. from the finish, frustrated by his opponents&#x27; tactics, Anquetil was ready to retire, but Boucher urged him on. Anquetil then pretended by untie his toe-straps, falling back in the group, causing his opponents to assume he would retire. He then attacked from the back of the group, left the competition behind, bridged a five-minute gap to the leading group and won. He was also victorious in the Grand Prix de France time trial, winning the event by a significant 12-minute margin. His first ever appearance at a national race came at the qualification event for the Olympic Games, he came third. Shortly after, he won the French amateur championships in Carcassonne, securing a call-up for the French squad at the Helsinki Olympic Games later in the year. On 3 August, he lined up for road race at the 1952 Summer Olympics, but was disappointed to only finish twelfth. He fared better in the team race, taking the bronze medal alongside Alfred Tonello and Claude Rouer. Next, he competed in the amateur road race at the 1952 UCI Road World Championships in Luxembourg, which also featured future stars such as Charly Gaul and Rik van Looy. The course, being run over a flat terrain, did not suit Anquetil, and he finished in the bunch, being ranked in equal eighth place with all finishers in his group.

For his final season as an amateur, Anquetil took a licence as an &quot;independent&quot;, a category between amateur and professional, which was abolished in 1966. This allowed him to enter races with young professionals to further test himself. After winning the independent championship of Normandy, his first race against professional competition came in August at the three-stage Tour de la Manche. On the first stage, he finished second, 24 seconds behind future World Champion Jean Stablinski. In the following day&#x27;s time trial, Anquetil won by almost 2 minutes, taking the lead of the race. On the final stage to Cherbourg, the riders on the rival teams tried to dislodge him, going so far as to force him into crashing into a ditch. Anquetil has then helped by another independent rider, Maurice Pelé, who disapproved of the others&#x27; tactics and assisted Anquetil in getting back into the group. Anquetil went on to finish safely in the peloton and won the race overall. In the amateur category, Anquetil was leading the season-long &quot;maillot des As&quot; competition run by the newspaper &quot;Paris–Normandy&quot;. The last race of the competition was a time trial on 23 August 1953. Anquetil won the event by a margin of nine minutes over second-placed Claude Le Ber at an average speed of , a speed unheard of from an amateur rider. This led journalist Alex Virot from Radio Luxembourg to joke that &quot;In Normandy there can only be 900 metres in a kilometre!&quot;. Following this exploit, Anquetil was invited to race in the Circuit de l&#x27;Aulne, the most prestigious criterium race in France, which that year included Tour de France winner Louison Bobet. Anquetil finished in the leading group but during the final sprint was held by the jersey by another, unknown rider, preventing him from victory, which went to Bobet.

==Professional career==
===1953: Grand Prix des Nations===
After his success at the Tour de la Manche, Anquetil was approached by several professional teams. Francis Pélissier, a former professional and sporting director of the La Perle team, offered him a contract in order to race in the Grand Prix des Nations in September. It was back then considered the most prestigious time trial event in the world, often described as the &quot;unofficial world championship&quot; for time trialists. Anquetil, still a minor, needed consent from his parents to sign the contract, which initially ran for two months from September to October 1953. He was paid 30,000 francs per month. The contract with La Perle briefly led to conflict between Anquetil and his coach Boucher, who threatened legal action. The two made up however in time for Boucher to help Anquetil prepare for the race.

The Grand Prix des Nations took place on 27 September over a distance from Versailles to the Parc des Princes in Paris. Anquetil prepared meticulously, sending himself postcards from different places along the route describing the course. On race day, he started strongly, even though he was held back by a puncture and a bike swap within the first couple of kilometres. He eventually won the time trial by a margin of almost seven minutes ahead of Roger Creton. Even though still just 19 years of age, he came within 35 seconds of beating the track record set by Hugo Koblet two years earlier. The victory made Anquetil an instant sensation in the sports press, with the Tour de France director Jacques Goddet writing an article in &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot; titled: &quot;When the Child Champion was Born.&quot;

Anquetil followed up his victory three weeks later with another in the Grand Prix de Lugano in Switzerland. Anquetil was then invited to ride the prestigious Trofeo Baracchi, a two-man time trial in Italy. On his way there, Anquetil visited his idol Fausto Coppi, still considered the best cyclist of the era at the time. They both competed in the Trofeo Baracchi, with Coppi winning alongside Riccardo Filippi. Anquetil and his partner, experienced rider Antonin Rolland, finished second. Rolland commented after the finish: &quot;I was well prepared and in very good form. Nevertheless, Jacques assassinated me and for the last 30 kilometres I could not go through; I was clinging on by the skin of my teeth.&quot;

===1954–1956: military service and Hour Record===
The first big challenge in Anquetil&#x27;s first full season as a professional was the week-long early-season stage race Paris–Nice. Albeit still only 20 years old, he managed to win the time trial stage and finished seventh overall. Strong results, although without victories, still secured him a spot on the French team for the World Championships held in Solingen. from the finish, Anquetil was part of an elite group at the front of the race, containing Bobet, Coppi, and Gaul. While Anquetil dropped back soon after, Bobet won the world title, but Anquetil finished a credible fifth, ahead of Coppi. All throughout the season, tensions grew between Anquetil and Pélissier, who felt that his young prodigy did not show enough discipline in terms of diet and constraint with alcohol. When Pélissier decided to follow Hugo Koblet during this year&#x27;s running of the Grand Prix des Nations, Anquetil was enraged by this perceived loss of trust. Come race day, he beat Koblet comprehensively. At the finish, Anquetil ignored Pélissier and then drove to Pélissier&#x27;s café outside of Paris and delivered the winner&#x27;s bouquet to his director&#x27;s wife.

Following an eleventh-place finish at Paris–Tours, Anquetil had to enroll for compulsory military service, which at the time in France lasted 30 months. He was transferred to the sportsman&#x27;s battalion at Joinville and was given great leeway to train and continue his cycling career in the following years. At the Trofeo Baracchi, Anquetil this time partnered Bobet, but having had only three hours of sleep prior to the race and arriving late in Italy, the pair finished second, again to Coppi and Filippi.

The 1955 season would be the last for the La Perle team, as funds were running low. In the spring, Anquetil finished 14th at Paris–Roubaix after breaking a chain during the race, while he was forced to abandon the Critérium National after a crash. He gathered more experience when he placed 15th at the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. At the French National Road Race Championships, he supported his teammate André Darrigade to beat Bobet for the title. Towards the end of the season, Anquetil won the national championship in the individual pursuit on the track, finished sixth in the world championship road race, before adding a third straight victory at the Grand Prix des Nations.

Momentum had been building in the press, urging Anquetil, known for his strength in time trials, to attempt to beat Coppi&#x27;s hour record for the longest distance covered in an hour, set in November 1942. Eventually, Anquetil announced that he would attempt to break the record, set for 22 October 1955 at the Velodromo Vigorelli in Milan. Anquetil started his attempt in a very high speed and was soon up on Coppi&#x27;s split times, but eventually slowed and he grew exhausted towards the end and failed, posting a distance shorter than Coppi. His final race of the season was once again the Trofeo Baracchi, this time teamed with Darrigade, only to again come second to the pairing of Coppi and Filippi.

Due to the ongoing Algerian War, every military service included a six-month stint in Algeria, which Anquetil had to begin in the second half of 1956. He therefore decided to make another attempt at the hour record before. Beforehand, he won another national pursuit title, but had to drop out of Paris–Nice due to a crash. Now riding for the Helyett team, he went on to win a stage at the Three Days of Antwerp. Anquetil then made his second attempt at the hour record on 25 June. Having again started too fast, he abandoned the attempt with five minutes to go. Another attempt was scheduled just four days later. This time not starting too fast and keeping to a rigid schedule, Anquetil finally managed to beat Coppi&#x27;s distance on the third attempt, breaking the hour record with , further than Coppi.

After his record, Anquetil continued the season by taking the silver medal in the individual pursuit at the Track Cycling World Championships. Another victory at the Grand Prix des Nations followed. Anquetil and Darrigade then went together to Italy to compete for the first time in the Giro di Lombardia, one of cycling&#x27;s monument classics, a race that Darrigade won. Anquetil was then posted to Algeria and ended his season.

===1957: first Tour de France victory===
Anquetil was discharged from the army on 1 March 1957. His first race back came just one day later, at Genoa–Nice, where he finished second in the sprint to Bobet. The result was impressive, considering that Anquetil had gained during his time in the army. It took him one month and of training to get back to his previous weight, before he started Paris–Nice. In the race, he won the mountainous stage 5 time trial, putting him into the overall lead, which he defended until the end. In a last-minute decision, Anquetil then again competed at the Track World Championships in the individual pursuit, but lost his race against eventual champion Roger Rivière.

By now, Anquetil was considered a possible favourite for the Tour de France, the most prestigious cycling race in the world. At this time, the riders in the Tour did not compete in trade teams, as in every other race, but in national teams. The selection for the French team was difficult for its manager Marcel Bidot. The previous year&#x27;s race had been won by a relatively unknown French rider from a regional team, Roger Walkowiak. This made him an automatic pick for the national team this time around. Meanwhile, three-time Tour winner Bobet, and with him his teammate Raphaël Géminiani, were also expected to be in the selection. Anquetil and Darrigade on the other hand publicly announced they would only ride if both were selected together. The selection was decided in Anquetil&#x27;s favour when Bobet announced during the Giro d&#x27;Italia that he would skip the Tour.

At the Tour, Anquetil was the only debutant in the French team. On stage 1, he was involved in a crash, but was safely brought back into the field. Anquetil&#x27;s first stage win came on stage 3 into his home town of Rouen. On stage 5 into Charleroi, Anquetil escaped with another rider and gained the yellow jersey of leader in the general classification for the first time in his career. He held the lead for two days and then attacked on stage 9 and won the into Thonon-les-Bains to reclaim the yellow jersey, gaining 11 minutes on his principal rivals. Federico Bahamontes, another race favourite, retired on the following rest day, due to the intense heat wave affecting the race. On the first high-mountain stage of the race into Briançon, Anquetil finished fourth, less than two minutes behind stage winner Gastone Nencini and Marcel Janssens, but retained the lead, 11 minutes ahead of Janssens. Following some uneventful stages, Anquetil&#x27;s rivals took advantage of him riding towards the back of the peloton to attack on stage 14, building a seven-rider lead group, all of which were within the top ten in the general classification. Darrigade fell back and worked with Anquetil to close the gap back down. The following day, Anquetil won the time trial at the Montjuïc circuit in Barcelona to extend his overall lead. He lost small amounts of time on stage 18, but bounced back to win the stage 20 time trial to seal his first victory in the Tour de France. His eventual winning margin over Janssens was almost 15 minutes. At 23, he was the youngest Tour winner since the end of World War II.

After the Tour, Anquetil competed in the World Championships in Waregem. The final part of the race was contested between a six-men group consisting of three French and three Belgian riders. Rik van Steenbergen won the sprint ahead of Bobet and Darrigade, while Anquetil finished sixth. He then won the Grand Prix des Nations again, beating Ercole Baldini. At the Six Days of Paris, he competed with Darrigade and Italian Ferdinando Terruzzi on the track, winning the event.

===1958: &quot;année terrible&quot;===
In 1958, Anquetil started his season slowly. He won the time trial stage at Paris–Nice in March, but only finished tenth overall, the same position he achieved at Milan–San Remo a couple of days later. After finishing twelfth at the Critérium National, he targeted Paris–Roubaix, a race he felt suited him. Still from the finish, he launched an attack, creating a 17-rider lead group, which soon broke down to just four due to Anquetil&#x27;s relentless pace setting. However, the Belgian teams in the peloton never allowed the gap to grow to over four minutes. While Anquetil managed to come back to the lead group after puncturing a tyre with left to run, the group was eventually caught before the finish. The failure to win at Roubaix was noted by the public, since it had been the first time that he had started a classics race with the intention of winning. Anquetil bounced back from the disappointment by taking victory at the Four Days of Dunkirk. In preparation for the Tour de France, Anquetil then finished eighth at the national championships.

As defending champion, Anquetil was the French team&#x27;s number one choice for the Tour de France. However, Bidot could not leave out three-time winner Bobet, which left the team with two captains. Anquetil agreed to this, but insisted that Bobet&#x27;s close ally Géminiani be left off the squad. Bidot relented and as Bobet did not stand up for Géminiani, their friendship was heavily strained thereafter. Géminiani went to the Tour as the leader of the Centre-Midi regional team and used every opportunity to attack the main French squad. After an uneventful start to the race, Géminiani attacked on stage 6 and gained ten minutes on Anquetil. Two days later, during the first time trial of the Tour, Anquetil was dealt another blow when Charly Gaul, usually considered more of a climber than a time trialist, managed to beat Anquetil in his favourite discipline, albeit by just seven seconds. On stage 18, a mountain time trial up Mont Ventoux, Anquetil lost more than four minutes on Gaul. While he had predicted such a result before the Tour started, as the climb suited Gaul more than him, it was still a blow considering the time Anquetil had already lost. Géminiani meanwhile did enough to secure the yellow jersey and gained more time on the following stage, owing to an untimely mechanical issue for Gaul. Going into stage 21 to Aix-les-Bains, Géminiani led the overall standings, Anquetil was third, 7:57 minutes behind, while Gaul was fifth at more than 15 minutes deficit. The stage featured five climbs, on the second of which Gaul attacked in rainy and cold conditions. Anquetil followed and was only two minutes behind Gaul at the foot of the next climb, the Col de Porte. The weather then got to Anquetil, who had opted to wear a light silk jersey instead of one made of wool. He lost 22 minutes by the end of the stage and developed a chest infection. Géminiani fared little better, losing 15 minutes to Gaul, who would go on to win the Tour after winning the final time trial. Even with his infection, Anquetil still decided to start the following stage in order to help the French team win the team classification, but after he coughed up blood, he was taken to hospital with fever and was forced to abandon.

Anquetil took some time to recover from his infection. In what he later described as the lowest point in his career, he even contemplated to retire, but eventually continued his career. The illness still hampered his efforts at the World Championships in Reims, where he abandoned. He recovered to win three end-of-the-season time trials, the Grands Prix in Geneva and Lugano, and the Grand Prix des Nations for the sixth time in a row. He then finished twelfth at both Paris–Tours and the Giro di Lombardia, before ending the road season by coming second at the Trofeo Baracchi. On the track, Anquetil, Darrigade, and Teruzzi then defended their title at the Parix Six-Days to close out the year, the last time the event was held at the Vélodrome d&#x27;Hiver. Anquetil&#x27;s biographer Paul Howard later described 1958 as his &quot;année terrible&quot; [&quot;terrible year&quot;].

===1959: failed attempt at the Giro–Tour double===
By the beginning of 1959, Roger Rivière had emerged as a serious challenger to Anquetil. Not only had he beaten Anquetil on his way to becoming World Champion in the individual pursuit, he also broke Baldini&#x27;s hour record and eventually improved it once again, becoming the first man to cover more than in an hour. Both riders faced each other for the first time on the road at the 1959 Paris–Nice. Neither rider won, and Rivière finished higher on the overall classification, but Anquetil&#x27;s teammate Jean Graczyk took the victory and Anquetil was faster in the time trial.

For 1959, Anquetil had set himself the target to equal his idol Fausto Coppi by winning the Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Tour de France in the same year. Also at the Giro was Gaul, who had won the race previously, in 1956. Anquetil started the race strongly, taking the race leader&#x27;s pink jersey after a short time trial on stage 2. He lost his lead to Gaul the following day, at a hilltop finish. Gaul increased his advantage on stage 7 by winning the mountain time trial up Mount Vesuvius, extending his advantage over second-placed Anquetil to 2:19 minutes. Anquetil was able to gain back 22 seconds on Gaul the next day, in another time trial. During stage 12, which featured three ascents of Monte Titano in San Marino, he managed to distance Gaul, gaining one-and-a-half minutes, reducing his deficit to just 34 seconds. On stage 15, Anquetil escaped with several other riders on a downhill and gained another two-and-a-half minutes on Gaul, taking back the pink jersey. While leading the race, Anquetil then won the stage 19 time trial to Susa. Riding at an average speed of (faster than Rivière&#x27;s hour record speed), Anquetil still managed to gain only 2:01 minutes on Gaul, who had started his effort one-and-a-half minutes ahead of Anquetil, and once the latter passed him, had hung on to limit his losses. After the time trial, Anquetil led Gaul by 3:49 minutes in the overall standings. The decisive stage therefore came on stage 21 to Courmayeur, where Gaul attacked on the Col du Petit-Saint-Bernard and eventually arrived at the stage finish almost ten minutes ahead of Anquetil to seal overall victory. Anquetil finished the Giro in second place, 6:12 minutes behind Gaul.

For the Tour de France, the French national team started with four possible contenders for overall victory: Anquetil, Bobet, Géminiani, and Rivière. While the latter two were riding on the same trade team and got along well, there was little sympathy and cooperation between the riders otherwise. In the event, Bobet retired from what would be his last Tour on top of the Col de l&#x27;Iseran, while Géminiani was significantly weaker than the year before and was not a threat for overall victory. The French team&#x27;s main challengers would come from Gaul, Spain&#x27;s Federico Bahamontes, Italian Ercole Baldini, and Henry Anglade, a Frenchman riding on the Centre/Midi regional team. The first notable stage for the general classification came in form of the stage 6 time trial, which was won by Rivière, 21 ahead of Baldini and almost a minute faster than Anquetil. The following day, Anglade was part of a breakaway that gained nearly 5 minutes on the rest of the field. On stage 13, Anglade won ahead of Anquetil, with Baldini and Bahamontes also in the lead group. Gaul suffered on the stage and lost twenty minutes, effectively ruling him out of contention. Anglade was now second in the overall standings, more than 3 minutes ahead of Baldini, Bahamontes, and Anquetil, while Rivière was more than six minutes behind Anglade. Two days later, Bahamontes won the mountain time trial up the Puy de Dôme, taking more than three minutes out of Anglade&#x27;s lead. Anquetil now laid sixth in the standings, more than five minutes behind second-placed Bahamontes. On stage 17 in the Alps, Bahamontes and Gaul escaped together, the latter taking the stage win while Bahamontes moved into the race lead, finishing three-and-a-half minutes ahead of the other challengers. The next stage was the decisive one of the race, with several high mountain climbs. Following the Col de l&#x27;Iseran, Anquetil and Rivière found themselves in a lead group, having distanced Bahamontes and Gaul, but allowed them to catch back on. On the descent of the following climb, the Col du Petit-Saint-Bernard, Anglade, Baldini, and Gaul attacked. Anquetil and Rivière then both assisted Bahamontes in regaining contact with the others. Baldini would win the stage while Bahamontes remained in the lead, 4:04 minutes ahead of Anglade, who lost another minute the following day. In the time trial on the penultimate stage to Dijon, Rivière again won ahead of Anquetil, beating him by 1:38 minutes, while Bahamontes sealed overall victory. As the French riders entered the Parc des Princes during the final stage, they were booed by the crowd, who felt that Anquetil and Rivière had colluded with Bahamontes against their fellow Frenchman, Anglade. The decision to have done so might have been affected by the fact that, had another French rider won the Tour, Anquetil&#x27;s market value for participation money in the lucrative post-Tour criteriums would have been less. Anquetil eventually finished the Tour third overall, 17 seconds ahead of fourth-placed Rivière.

At the World Championships in Zandvoort, Anquetil finished ninth as his friend Darrigade won the title. In early September, he won the prestigious Critérium des As, run behind dernys. Anquetil ended his season with victories at the Grand Prix Martini and Grand Prix de Lugano time trials, but for the first time since his first victory in 1953, he did not compete in the Grand Prix des Nations, won by Aldo Moser ahead of Rivière. At the Trofeo Baracchi, Anquetil, paired with Darrigade, finished only third, after they missed the start time by over a minute, but where also outridden by the pairing of Moser and Baldini.

===1960: Giro d&#x27;Italia success===
Following two years without victory in a major stage race and with Rivière proving his match in time trials, Anquetil&#x27;s star seemed to be fading at the beginning of 1960. Not wanting to share leadership of the French team with Rivière, Anquetil therefore chose to focus solely on the Giro d&#x27;Italia this year. At Paris–Nice, in the team time trial on stage 2, Anquetil, who had suffered mechanical issues, was dropped by his teammates and lost four-and-a-half minutes on his principal rivals. On stage 4, a large breakaway got clear and Anquetil&#x27;s team decided not to organize a chase. This allowed the leading group to come in more than 23 minutes ahead of the field, making it virtually impossible for anybody not in it to compete for overall victory. Anquetil&#x27;s poor form was further highlighted when he finished only fourth in the time trial on stage 6b and he retired the following day. He then finished third at the Critérium National, before coming in fourteenth at the Tour of Flanders.

In the first time trial of the Giro d&#x27;Italia, Anquetil finished second, but then took advantage of a breakaway he was part of on stage 3 to take the overall lead. Anquetil then led the lead move to Jos Hoevenaers, who had been part of a breakaway on stage 6. In the long time trial of the race on stage 14, Anquetil retook the lead, finishing 1:27 minutes ahead of Baldini and more than 6 minutes on Gaul. His speed had been so fast that had the organizers applied the usual rules, 70 riders would have missed the time cut. In the event, the rules were loosened and only two riders eliminated. Ahead of the final mountain stages, Anquetil now led Nencini by 3:40 minutes, with Gaul in fifth, 7:32 minutes behind. Stage 20 included the Gavia Pass for the first time in the race&#x27;s history. On the ascent, Nencini was able to establish a gap to Anquetil, after the latter had a flat tire. More punctures and three bike changes followed on the dangerous descent, putting Anquetil&#x27;s race lead in danger. He teamed up with Agostino Coletto, whom he offered money to help him in the chase effort, to limit his losses. At the finish in Bormio, Gaul won ahead of Nencini, with Anquetil losing only 2:34 minutes and retaining the pink jersey by 28 seconds. Following a ceremonial final stage, Anquetil arrived in Milan the winner of the Giro for the first time.

In Anquetil&#x27;s absence, Rivière competed in the 1960 Tour de France as leader of the French team and was well placed when, on stage 14, he crashed while trying to follow Nencini on a steep descent. He fell down a ravine and broke two vertebrae, immediately ending his career. The great rivalry with Anquetil therefore ended abruptly. Paul Howard later wrote that with Rivière&#x27;s accident &quot;by late 1960 Anquetil was temporarily free from a serious adversary, at least within French cycling circles&quot;.

At the World Championships in East Germany, Anquetil arrived with little preparation, but still managed to finish ninth. Another strong time trial performance followed at the Grand Prix de Lugano, where Anquetil was so fast that second-placed rider Gilbert Desmet owed his position to the fact that Anquetil overtook him and he followed him into the finish. He followed this up with another victory at the Critérium des As, breaking the record speed in the process. Having attacked into the race to test his legs, Anquetil decided that he felt so good that he did not slow down and rode alone until the finish.

===1961: Tour de France return===
In early 1961, Anquetil took victory at Paris–Nice. At the Critérium National, he attacked with left to go and won ahead of Darrigade, who had switched teams to Alcyon–Leroux. It was Anquetil&#x27;s first ever victory at a one-day road race. He then competed in the Tour de Romandie, winning the time trial and finishing tenth overall, in preparation for the Giro d&#x27;Italia.

At the Giro, Anquetil won the time trial on stage 9 and gained the pink jersey the following day, when he was part of a breakaway that reached the finish ahead of previous leader Guillaume van Tongerloo. On stage 14, a seven-rider breakaway got away, which included Arnaldo Pambianco, who was third overall. At the finish, they had a 1:42 minute advantage on the peloton containing Anquetil, putting Pambianco into the lead. Anquetil then lost another twenty seconds on stage 17, before the race reached the high mountains. On the decisive stage 20, which featured the climbs of the Penser Joch and the Stelvio Pass, Gaul won two minutes ahead of Pambianco, with Anquetil losing another three minutes (two of which in time bonuses). Therefore, Pambianco won the Giro, 3:45 minutes ahead of Anquetil.

At the National Championship race before the Tour, Anquetil finished fourth, with the title going to Raymond Poulidor, who had earlier in the year won Milan–San Remo. Poulidor would emerge as Anquetil&#x27;s new main rival, but was left out of the French team for the upcoming Tour de France as his team manager Antonin Magne did not want him to have to work for Anquetil. The Tour began in Anquetil&#x27;s home town of Rouen and before the start, he announced that he planned to hold the race lead from the first day until the end. There were two stages run on the first day, a road stage to Versailles in the morning and then a time trial in the afternoon, with the yellow jersey only being awarded at the end of the day. Anquetil already got in the winning breakaway on the first stage, won by Darrigade, and then in the afternoon, he won the time trial by more than three minutes from the rider in second place to move into the overall lead. Over the course of the race, Anquetil rode very passively, only chasing down attacks and limiting his losses, but never going on the attack himself. This led to a race that was considered dull by the public, with sales numbers of the organizing newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot; going down as the Tour progressed. Anquetil won the time trial on stage 19 to effectively seal his second Tour de France victory, finishing the course almost three minutes faster than second-placed Gaul. On the final stage into Paris, he attacked together with teammate Robert Cazala, who won the stage. Guido Carlesi used the same breakaway to distance Gaul and take over second place. Anquetil&#x27;s winning margin over him was 12:14 minutes. Due to what the spectators considered a lack of excitement during the race, Anquetil was booed when they arrived at the Parc des Princes.

Following the Tour, Anquetil competed at the World Championships in Bern, finishing in the lead group in 13th place. He then rode the Grand Prix des Nations for the first time since 1958, taking victory in record time and beating second-placed Desmet by more than nine minutes. Following victory at the Grand Prix de Lugano, he managed only fifth place at the Trofeo Baracchi, partnered by Michel Stolker, his worst position at the event during his career. Nevertheless, at the end of the season he was honored with the Super Prestige Pernod for the first time, an award given to the best rider of the year based on points given for high positions in prestigious races.

===1962: third Tour de France victory===
For the new season in 1962, Anquetil&#x27;s team Heylett folded and merged with the Saint-Raphaël team, whose sporting director was Géminiani, Anquetil&#x27;s former rival, who had since retired. His early season results were not good, having to retire from both Genoa–Nice and Paris–Nice. Anquetil had set himself the goal to become the first rider to have won all three of cycling&#x27;s Grand Tours, which meant that for 1962, he targeted the Vuelta a España. Here, he had to share team leadership with Rudi Altig. The race came down to the time trial on stage 15, which Altig won decisively. Anquetil then dropped out of the race following the stage, only to be diagnosed with viral hepatitis once back in France. Altig eventually won the Vuelta. Against the advice of his doctor, who felt that the illness had weakened Anquetil too much, he then raced in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré in preparation for the Tour. He suffered during the fifth stage, where he lost 17 minutes, but managed to finish the race in 12th place overall.

For the 1962 Tour de France, the organizers dropped the provisions of national teams and allowed the riders to compete in trade teams, meaning that Anquetil rode for Saint-Raphaël. Poulidor was considered his main competition along with reigning World Champion Rik van Looy, both were riding their first Tour. A break within the peloton on the first stage, won by Altig, saw Poulidor lose almost 8 minutes. Anquetil won the stage 8b time trial and moved into 12th place in the general classification, behind a number of riders who had been in an earlier breakaway, but were not considered threats for overall victory. On stage 11, the first in the Pyrenees, van Looy was brought down when a motorbike caused a crash, leading him to abandon. After stage 12, also in the high mountains, Anquetil moved up into sixth place. The following day was a mountain time trial to Superbagnères. Anquetil finished the day third, behind stage winner Bahamontes and Jef Planckaert, the surprise of the Tour, who moved into the race lead, with Anquetil in fourth, 1:08 minutes behind. On stage 19, Poulidor escaped and went on to win the stage, while Anquetil finished with Planckaert, which left their time difference intact. However, Anquetil had moved up to second and Poulidor up to third. In the time trial on stage 20 to Lyon, Anquetil won with ease, catching Poulidor for three minutes at the half-way mark of the course and beating Planckaert by 5:19 minutes. This gave Anquetil a record-equalling third Tour victory, 4:59 minutes ahead of Planckaert, who showed sportsmanship when he did not attack Anquetil when the latter suffered a crash on the final day into Paris. After the Tour, it was discovered that Anquetil had ridden the entire event with a tapeworm.

While recovering from the worm, Anquetil placed only fifteenth at the World Championships in Salò, won by his friend and teammate Jean Stablinski. Still weakened, he then skipped most of the late-season time trials, but for the Trofeo Baracchi, which he attended together with Altig. Not having prepared well for the event, Anquetil suffered from the beginning and was unable to take turns at the front, forced to stay in Altig&#x27;s slipstream and at some points suffering the humiliation of Altig having to push him in order to keep up. When they reached the finish, their time was taken at the entrance of the velodrome. As they entered the arena, Anquetil was unable to take the sharp right turn onto the track, drove onto the grass, and crashed into a crowd of spectators. The pair had won the event, in record time, but Anquetil was brought into hospital, his face covered in blood, while Altig took the victory lap on his own. Feeling humiliated by the experience, Anquetil prepared well for a similar two-men time trial event two weeks later in Altig&#x27;s home country, in Baden-Baden. This time, it was Anquetil who set a high pace which Altig had a hard time following.

===1963: Vuelta-Tour double===
Early in 1963, Anquetil won Paris–Nice and the Critérium National in preparation for another attempt at the Vuelta. He lined up at the 1963 Vuelta a España in good shape. He won the stage 1b time trial on the first afternoon by 2:51 minutes on the second placed rider, including the time bonus, he already held more than three minutes advantage on his rivals. Anquetil&#x27;s team managed to neutralize all the attacks during the difficult first week. The remaining stages were mostly flat and suited Anquetil. Even though he only finished second on the stage 12b time trial to Tarragona, suffering from stomach cramps, he eventually won the Vuelta easily, beating José Martín Colmenarejo by 3:06 minutes. With his victory, he became the first rider to have won all the Grand Tours.

To prepare for the Tour, Anquetil competed in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, where he won the time trial and the general classification. Thereafter, he helped Stablinski to victory at the National Championships, himself finishing third. The Tour de France became a fight between Anquetil and Bahamontes, who gained time when he got into a breakaway on the first stage. After winning the stage 6b time trial, Anquetil moved up into seventh place overall, behind a number of riders who had been in earlier breakaways, but more than a minute ahead of Bahamontes and Poulidor. On stage 10, he managed to stay with Bahamontes and outsprinted him at the finish, gaining his first-ever victory on a mountain stage. On stage 17, Anquetil and Géminiani used a ruse, pretending to suffer a broken chain, to allow Anquetil to switch to a lighter bike for the ascent of the Col de la Forclaz, allowing him to stay with Bahamontes on the steep climb and again outsprint him at the finish. He had therefore moved into the race lead, extending his advantage in the final time trial. His eventual winning margin over Bahamontes was 3:35 minutes as he became the first rider to win the Tour four times.

At the World Championship road race in Ronse, Anquetil was leading alone with ahead of the chasing field, but led up his effort when he turned around to see the other riders approaching. After the finish, second-placed van Looy was irritated at Anquetil, saying that he had given up his chance at certain victory. Towards the end of the season, he competed in the Trofeo Baracchi, partnered with Poulidor, where they finished second. For the second time, he won the Super Prestige Pernod for the best rider of the season.

===1964: Giro d&#x27;Italia, a fifth Tour de France, and the duel with Poulidor===

At the beginning of the 1964 season, Anquetil raced at Paris–Nice again, being beaten in the uphill time trial by Poulidor and finishing only sixth. When he lined up for the spring classic Gent–Wevelgem, few expected much of him, since Anquetil did not usually excel at one-day races. A few kilometres before the finish, Anquetil, not familiar with the course, asked another rider where the finish was. Given the answer that it was not far away, he broke away from the field for an unlikely victory, his first at a one-day road race outside of France. For 1964, Anquetil had again set himself the target to emulate Coppi by winning the Giro and the Tour in the same year. He started the Giro d&#x27;Italia strongly, winning the stage 5 time trial at a speed of more than , taking the race lead in the process. Though he was unable to add another stage victory, he would not lose the pink jersey until the finish in Milan, beating Italo Zilioli by 1:22 minutes.

The 1964 Tour de France would become a two-man fight between Anquetil and Poulidor. The latter lost 14 seconds after a crash on the first stage, but took some time back when he escaped in a group on stage 7, with Anquetil reaching the finish 34 seconds behind. The next day, Anquetil lost another 47 seconds, as Poulidor finished second and Anquetil suffered a puncture. On stage 9, finishing in Monaco, Poulidor sprinted for the stage victory and celebrated, only to realize there was another lap to run. The second time around, it was Anquetil who won the stage and with it a one-minute time bonus. The next day, Anquetil also won the time trial, taking another 46 seconds advantage on Poulidor. In the general classification, Anquetil now was second, with Poulidor third, 31 seconds behind. During the rest day in Andorra, Anquetil, known for his extravagant eating habits, was pictured eating a &quot;méchoui&quot;, an entire lamb. The next day, stage 14, Anquetil started badly, falling behind on the first climb and even contemplating retiring from the race. Being four minutes behind Poulidor, Bahamontes, and yellow jersey Georges Groussard, Anquetil found himself in a group of seven riders who worked well together and succeeded in bridging the gap. Poulidor then had to change bikes with to go, and fell into the ditch when his director pushed him too hard when he got going again. By the end of the stage, Poulidor had lost 2:37 minutes on Anquetil. Poulidor managed to record a strong solo victory on the following stage into Luchon, gaining enough time to close the gap on Anquetil in the general classification to just nine seconds. In the stage 17 time trial, Anquetil took victory, but Poulidor managed to reduce his losses to just 37 seconds, even though he suffered a puncture and a slow bike change, leaving him 56 seconds down on Anquetil overall. Stage 20 was the decisive leg of the race, ending on the Puy de Dôme climb. Poulidor attacked early in the stage, but was brought back by Anquetil with the help of Altig. As they reached the final climb, Bahamontes and Julio Jiménez escaped, while Anquetil and Poulidor made the ascent side-by-side. In what would become one of the Tour&#x27;s most historic stages, the two opponents went up the climb elbow to elbow, until , Anquetil weakened, allowing Poulidor to slowly get ahead of him. By the finish, Poulidor had taken 42 seconds out of Anquetil&#x27;s advantage, who remained in the yellow jersey. After crossing the finish line, Anquetil asked Géminiani how much time he had lost. When his sporting director answered &quot;Fourteen seconds&quot;, Anquetil replied: &quot;Well, that&#x27;s thirteen more than I need.&quot; Anquetil then went on to win the final time trial into Paris, extending his eventual winning margin to 55 seconds over Poulidor. It was Anquetil&#x27;s fifth Tour victory and the fierce duel between him and Poulidor started a cycling boom in France. Anquetil became the first rider since Coppi to win both the Giro and the Tour in the same year.

Anquetil raced little after the Tour, finishing seventh at the World Championships in Sallanches and skipping all of the end-of-season time trials.

===1965: Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and Bordeaux–Paris===

For 1965, Saint-Raphaël stopped sponsorship of Anquetil&#x27;s team, which was taken over by Ford France. In those days, the main income for professional cyclists came from criteriums, small races run over laps in city centres, usually held shortly after the Tour de France. Since Anquetil had found that winning more Tours would not increase his value in terms of start money, he opted not to race any of the three Grand Tours in 1965. Early in the season, he won both Paris–Nice and the Critérium National and also participated for three days in the Monte Carlo Rally to placate his new sponsor Ford.

Instead of the Grand Tours, Géminiani decided to propose another feat: the 1965 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré ended on the same day that the classic Bordeaux–Paris started, a race partly done behind dernies due to its excessive length. Géminiani pitched the idea to Anquetil&#x27;s wife Jeanine, who then convinced her husband to try to win both races. The announcement of the attempt made headlines in the newspapers, bringing significant publicity to both events. The organizers of the Critérium du Dauphiné, originally reluctant of the idea, eventually aided the attempt by moving the start time of the final stage one hour forward to give Anquetil enough time to get from Avignon (finishing town of the Dauphiné) to Bordeaux. At the Critérium du Dauphiné, Anquetil won narrowly, mostly through time bonuses at stage finishes and a slender victory in the time trial. However, he eventually won the race by 1:43 minutes over Poulidor. Just 15 minutes after standing on the podium at 5 pm, Anquetil was already in a car, being driven to the hotel for a bath and dinner, before heading to Nîmes airport, boarding a private jet which flew him to Bordeaux. The race to Paris started in the middle of the night, and Anquetil, not having slept, suffered at the beginning. Coming close to retiring in the early hours of the morning, he was convinced by his teammates to continue. He eventually joined a breakaway with Tom Simpson and Stablinski and then attacked on the Côte de Picardie climb, from the finish, and went on to win the race by 57 seconds ahead of Stablinski.

After failing to finish the World Championships in San Sebastián, Anquetil returned to the end-of-season time trials. He won the Grand Prix des Nations ahead of Altig and then beat Gianni Motta at the Gran Premio di Lugano. Anquetil then won his second ever Trofeo Baracchi, partnered with Stablinski. For the third time, Anquetil won the Super Prestige Pernod.

===1966: Grand Tour return and Liège–Bastogne–Liège victory===
Anquetil started the 1966 strongly with victory at the Giro di Sardegna. At Paris–Nice, he was in the race lead but lost time to Poulidor on a hilly time trial due to his bike not being fitted properly. Anquetil then struck an alliance with the Italian riders around Gianni Motta and their joint attacks put Poulidor under pressure, allowing Anquetil to win the stage and the race overall. In early May, he was on the start line for Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the oldest race on the cycling calendar and one of the sport&#x27;s so-called monuments. Anquetil felt he had a chance of victory at escaped alone from a group containing Motta, Felice Gimondi, and a young Eddy Merckx. Even though the trio worked together well to bring him back, Anquetil&#x27;s advantage continued to grow until the finish, where he won by almost five minutes. After the finish, he was approached while conducting interviews, being told he had to deliver a urine sample for the doping control, but he did not pay any attention to it and left. The next day, news broke that he had been disqualified by the Belgian cycling federation for his refusal. Following Anquetil&#x27;s insistence that he had not been approached for the test officially, the authorities relented and his victory was allowed to stand.

Unlike the previous year, Anquetil lined up for the 1966 Giro d&#x27;Italia. On the very first stage, he suffered two flat tires when an overenthusiastic fan tried to give him water, fell, and the glass bottle broke on the ground. A 22-rider group, containing all the other favourites, got away while Anquetil had his tires taken care of and at the finish, he had lost 3:15 minutes. Second place behind Vittorio Adorni in the stage 13 time trial brought him up to tenth place overall, but Anquetil no longer felt like he could win the Giro and set to preventing Gimondi from winning, since he considered the rising popularity of the young Italian a threat to his financial opportunities during the criteriums. After some strong riding in the mountain stages, Anquetil eventually finished third in the Giro, 4:40 minutes behind winner Motta.

The 1966 Tour de France was again expected to be a battle between Anquetil and Poulidor. On stage 9, Anquetil led a strike by the riders against the newly established anti-doping controls. Both Anquetil and Poulidor mainly marked one another, allowing Anquetil&#x27;s teammate Lucien Aimar and Jan Janssen to gain time on stage 10. Poulidor won the time trial on stage 14b, 7 seconds ahead of Anquetil. On stage 17, Aimar took advantage of the stalemate to break away from the lead group, win the stage, and take over the race lead. Anquetil, weakened by illness, helped Aimar by chasing down attacks from Janssen and Poulidor over the next stage, before dropping out the next day. Aimar eventually won the Tour ahead of Janssen and Poulidor.

After the Tour, Anquetil competed at the World Championships held on the Nürburgring racing circuit. Late in the race, Anquetil and Poulidor were in a leading group with Motta, but both Frenchmen did not work together, allowing Altig to catch back up. In the final sprint to the line, Altig, by far the best sprinter, easily won, taking the title on home soil. Anquetil finished second, ahead of Poulidor, the highest position he would ever achieve in the World Championships. Anquetil then started and won the Grand Prix des Nations for the ninth time in his career, the final time he would ride the race. In the Super Prestige Pernod, Anquetil was highly placed going into the final race of the competition, the Giro di Lombardia. He finished fourth, earning him enough points to win the season-long competition for the fourth and last time in his career.

===1967–1969: final years and invalidated Hour Record attempt===

With Ford France pulling out of sponsorship, Anquetil, like many of his teammates and director Géminiani, switched over to the Bic team. By 1967, Anquetil started to appear in less one-day races, but lined up on short notice at the Critérium National, held in his home town of Rouen, and won. Anquetil then again started at the Giro d&#x27;Italia, losing some time early on, before moving into the pink jersey with a fourth place in the stage 16 time trial, as all other favourites put in poor rides. He lost the lead the next day to Silvano Schiavon, who had shared a successful breakaway with Franco Balmamion. Having lost all but two teammates by the start of stage 20, Anquetil managed to limit his losses on the stage to regain the overall lead, albeit just 34 seconds ahead of Gimondi. During the following stage, he fended off several attacks, but eventually Gimondi managed to escape, gaining 4:09 minutes on Anquetil, relegating him to second place. On the penultimate stage on the final day, Anquetil made several attacks, but was unable to break away from Gimondi. Thus tired, he proceeded to lose second place to Balmamion and finished the Giro in third.

For its 1967 edition, the Tour de France reverted to national teams and Marcel Bidot picked Poulidor as leader, while Anquetil stayed away. He instead decided that he would make an attempt at breaking Rivière&#x27;s now eleven-year old hour record. On 27 September, he made the attempt, again at the Velodromo Vigorelli, beating the record by . After Anquetil finished his ride, he was approached by the doctor appointed by the sport&#x27;s governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), to conduct his doping test. Géminiani protested that there was no lavatory on site at the velodrome and that Anquetil would not provide the urine sample out in the open. Since the doctor refused to travel with Anquetil to his hotel, no test was done and Anquetil&#x27;s record therefore never ratified by the UCI. For the first time in his career, Anquetil was not chosen as part of the French team at the World Championships, but Anquetil managed a second place at the Trofeo Baracchi, partnering Bernard Guyot, to end his season. At the end of the year, Anquetil became chairman of the French Professional Cyclists Union, responsible for advocating the riders&#x27; interests towards the governing bodies and race organizers.

The final two seasons of Anquetil&#x27;s career were relatively quiet. He did not race much in 1968, with his only victory coming at the Trofeo Baracchi, riding together with Gimondi. In 1969, he finished third at Paris–Nice and then won the Tour of the Basque Country, his last victory as a professional. His last professional race on the road was the World Championship road race in Zolder, where he placed 40th. He participated in a number of autumn criteriums and raced for the last time in Paris at the La Cipale velodrome at a track event, the venue would later be named after him. Anquetil&#x27;s final outing was at a track event in Belgium on 27 December 1969.

==Post-retirement==
After he retired from professional cycling, Anquetil spent most of his time tending to his own farm, even though it was not profitable. He also owned several properties in Cannes as well as a gravel pit in Normandy. Apart from these business endeavors, Anquetil served as race director at both Paris–Nice and the Grand Prix du Midi Libre. He wrote columns for the L&#x27;Equipe sports newspaper and worked as commentator during races, first on the radio for Europe 1 and then on television for Antenne 2. In the early 1970s, Anquetil agreed to help , who had been his superior in the army in Algeria, run the French national cycling team. Anquetil did not really fulfill any practical function in his position, but helped bring Marillier, who was relatively unknown in the cycling world, a greater sense of authority. Anquetil continued in this position until the 1987 UCI Road World Championships, shortly before his death.

== Anquetil–Poulidor: the social significance ==

Anquetil unfailingly beat Raymond Poulidor in the Tour and yet Poulidor remained more popular. Divisions between their fans became marked, which two sociologists studying the impact of the Tour on French society say became emblematic of France old and new. The extent of those divisions is shown in a story, perhaps apocryphal, told by Pierre Chany, who was close to Anquetil:

The Tour de France has the major fault of dividing the country, right down to the smallest hamlet, even families, into two rival camps. I know a man who grabbed his wife and held her on the grill of a heated stove, seated and with her skirts held up, for favouring Jacques Anquetil when he preferred Raymond Poulidor. The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in their heels and the neighbours were complaining.

Jean-Luc Boeuf and Yves Léonard, in their study, wrote:

Those who recognised themselves in Jacques Anquetil liked his priority of style and elegance in the way he rode. Behind this fluidity and the appearance of ease was the image of France winning and those who took risks identified with him. Humble people saw themselves in Raymond Poulidor, whose face – lined with effort – represented the life they led on land they worked without rest or respite. His declarations, full of good sense, delighted the crowds: a race, even a difficult one, lasts less time than a day bringing in the harvest. A big part of the public therefore finished by identifying with the one who symbolised bad luck and the eternal position of runner-up, an image that was far from true for Poulidor, whose record was particularly rich. Even today, the expression of the eternal second and of a Poulidor Complex is associated with a hard life, as an article by Jacques Marseille showed in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; when it was headlined &quot;This country is suffering from a Poulidor Complex&quot;.

== Riding style ==
Anquetil was a smooth rider, a beautiful pedalling machine according to the American journalist Owen Mulholland:

The sight of Jacques Anquetil on a bicycle gives credence to an idea we Americans find unpalatable, that of a natural aristocracy. From the first day he seriously straddled a top tube, &quot;Anq&quot; had a sense or perfection most riders spend a lifetime searching for. Between 1950, when he rode his first race, and nineteen years later, when he retired, Anquetil had countless frames underneath him, yet that indefinable poise was always there.

The look was that of a greyhound. His arms and legs were extended more than was customary in his era of pounded post World War II roads. And the toes pointed down. Just a few years before, riders had prided their ankling motion, but Jacques was the first of the big gear school. His smooth power dictated his entire approach to the sport. Hands resting serenely on his thin Mafac brake levers, the sensation from Quincampoix, Normandy, appeared to cruise while others wriggled in desperate attempts to keep up.

== Personal life and family==
In March 1957, Anquetil began an affair with Jeanine Boëda, the wife of his doctor and seven years his senior. They had known each other for several years before the start of their relationship. Anquetil had just been discharged from the army, where, in Algeria, he had begun an affair with Paule Voland, a ballet dancer at the Opera d&#x27;Algers. This affair had caused a public sensation and Voland traveled to Rouen in June 1957 to visit Anquetil&#x27;s parents, in the belief that he would propose marriage to her. He eventually had Jeanine deliver the news to Voland that he did not intend to do so. In early 1958, Jeanine confessed the ongoing affair to her husband, who denied her a divorce. Anquetil then abandoned a training camp in the Mediterranean to travel to Normandy and showed up on the Boëdas&#x27; doorstep. Only dressed in her night clothes, Jeanine went with him to Paris. They lived together from that point on. Jeanine&#x27;s two children, her daughter Annie and her son Alain, moved in with them two years later. Jeanine would accompany Anquetil to most of his races, at a time when it was unusual for a partner to do so. By the end of 1958, her husband granted Jeanine a divorce and she and Anquetil were married on 22 December 1958. In late 1967, Anquetil bought the château next to the farm he owned close to Rouen. He prolonged his career by two years in order to be able to pay it off.

Following his retirement from professional cycling, Anquetil had a strong desire to father a child of his own, however, Jeanine was no longer able to conceive. Anquetil therefore suggested using a surrogate mother, someone they would pay to have their child. Jeanine, not liking the idea of a stranger who they might deprive of their child, instead went to her 18-year-old daughter Annie, who consented to the idea of having a child with her stepfather. Even after their daughter, Sophie, was born in 1971, Annie and Anquetil remained in a sexual relationship while he remained happily married to Jeanine for another 12 years. While the general public was in the dark about the situation surrounding Sophie&#x27;s parentage, according to Jeanine, their close friends knew about it. Annie eventually met another man and ended her relationship with Anquetil, moving out in 1983, while Sophie initially remained with him and her grandmother. Several months later, in an apparent attempt to win back Annie by making her jealous, Anquetil seduced Dominique, wife of his stepson Alain, who both lived with the family. Anquetil&#x27;s new affair broke the family apart, with Sophie moving in with Annie and Jeanine leaving to live in Paris shortly thereafter. Alain also left and remarried. Anquetil and Jeanine were eventually divorced in September 1987. Dominique and Anquetil had a son together, Christopher, born on 2 April 1986.

===Illness and death===
Anquetil was diagnosed with an advanced form of stomach cancer on 25 May 1987. According to both his childhood friend Dieulois and fellow Tour winner Bernard Hinault, Anquetil waited until he received proper treatment, delaying it to fulfill commentating duties over the summer before going to hospital. On 11 August, he had his stomach removed surgically. He died on 18 November 1987, surrounded by Sophie and Dominique, at the Saint Hilaire Clinic in Rouen.

===Legacy===
The 1997 Tour de France paid homage to Anquetil, on the 40th anniversary of his first Tour victory and ten years after his death, by having the &quot;Grand Départ&quot; around Rouen. On the day of the first stage, a ceremony was held at his grave and a pier in Quincampoix was renamed Quai Anquetil.

== Doping ==
Anquetil never hid that he took drugs and in a debate with a government minister on French television said only a fool would imagine it was possible to ride Bordeaux–Paris on just water. He and other cyclists had to ride through &quot;the cold, through heat waves, in the rain and in the mountains&quot;, and they had the right to treat themselves as they wished, he said, before adding: &quot;Leave me in peace; everybody takes dope.&quot; There was implied acceptance of doping right to the top of the state: Charles de Gaulle said: &quot;Doping? What doping? Did he or did he not make them play the Marseillaise [the national anthem] abroad?&quot;

Anquetil argued that professional riders were workers and had the same right to treat their pains, as say, a geography teacher. But the argument found less support as more riders were reported to have died or suffered health problems through drug-related incidents, including the death of Tom Simpson, in the 1967 Tour de France.

However, there was great support in the cyclist community for Anquetil&#x27;s argument that, if there were to be rules and tests, the tests should be carried out consistently and with dignity. He said it was professional dignity, the right of a champion not to be ridiculed in front of his public, that led to his refusal to take a test in the centre of the Vigorelli track after breaking the world hour record.

The unrecognised time that Anquetil set that day was nevertheless broken by the Belgian rider Ferdinand Bracke. Anquetil was hurt that the French government had never sent him a telegram of congratulations but sent one to Bracke, who was not French. It was a measure of the unacceptability of Anquetil&#x27;s arguments, as was the way he was quietly dropped from future French teams.

<text>The KG Mobility Corporation (, ), abbreviated as KGM, is a South Korean automobile manufacturer. It traces its origins back to Dong-A Motor, a manufacturer established in 1954. The company was named SsangYong Motor Company in 1988, following its acquisition in 1986 by the SsangYong Group, a chaebol. Since then, SsangYong Motor has been acquired successively by Daewoo Motors, Chinese manufacturer SAIC Motor, and Indian manufacturer Mahindra &amp; Mahindra. In 2022, the company was acquired by South Korean chaebol KG Group and adopted its present name in March 2023.

The company&#x27;s main focus is sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and crossover SUVs, and it is transitioning its focus to electric cars. The KGM Commercial manufactures commercial vehicles, including electric buses.

==History==
===Dong-A Motor (1954–1987)===
SsangYong originally started out as two separate companies; Ha Dong-hwan Motor Workshop (established in 1954) and Dongbang Motor Co (established in 1962). In mid-1963, the two companies merged into Ha Dong-hwan Motor Co. (). In 1964, Hadonghwan Motor Company started building jeeps for the US Army as well as trucks and buses. Beginning in 1976, Hadonghwan produced a variety of special purpose vehicles. After changing its name to Dong-A Motor () in 1977 and taking control of Keohwa in 1984, it was taken over by SsangYong Business Group in 1986.

====Gallery====

===Keohwa (1981–1984)===

Keohwa, Ltd. () was a South Korean assembler of Jeeps under licence, mainly for export markets. Its predecessor was the Jeep assembly joint venture of Shinjin Motors and American Motor Corporation (AMC), established in 1974. It was spun off as an independent company in 1981, after AMC left the venture and retired the permission to use the Jeep trade mark. In 1983, Jeeps from Keohwa started to be named as &quot;Korando&quot;. In 1984, Keohwa was acquired by the predecessor of SsangYong Motor, Dong-A Motor.

=== SsangYong Motor Company (1986–2023) ===

After Dong-A Motor was taken over by SsangYong Business Group, Dong-A Motor&#x27;s name was changed to SsangYong Motor in 1988. In 1987, it acquired United Kingdom-based specialty car maker Panther Westwinds.
In 1991, SsangYong started a technology partnership with Daimler-Benz. The deal was for SsangYong to develop a sport utility vehicle (SUV) with Mercedes-Benz technology. This was supposedly to allow SsangYong to gain footholds in new markets without having to build their own infrastructure (utilizing existing Mercedes-Benz networks) while giving Mercedes a competitor in the then-booming SUV market. This resulted in the Musso, which was sold first by Mercedes-Benz and later by SsangYong.

SsangYong further benefited from this alliance, long after Daimler-Benz stopped selling the Musso, producing a badge engineered version of the Mercedes-Benz MB100, the Istana and using Daimler designs in many other models, including the second-generation Korando (engine and transmission), the Rexton (transmission), the Chairman H (chassis and transmission) and the Kyron (transmission).

==== Takeover by Daewoo Motors and SAIC ====
In 1997, Daewoo Motors, now GM Korea, bought a controlling stake from the SsangYong Group, only to sell it off again in 2000, because the conglomerate ran into deep financial troubles. In late 2004, the Chinese automobile manufacturer SAIC took a 51% stake of SsangYong Motor Company. In July – August 2006, workers went on strike for 7 weeks to protest SAIC&#x27;s plans to lay off 554 employees. The strike cost SsangYong 380 billion Won and negotiations ended with workers accepting a wage freeze.

In January 2009, after recording a $75.42 million loss, the company was put into receivership. This may have been due to the global economic crisis and shrinking demand. In response to management&#x27;s plan to cut 2,600 jobs, a third of the workforce, workers at Ssangyong&#x27;s main factory stopped work and barricaded themselves inside in protest. One elderly worker died from a cerebral hemorrhage within the first 12 days. The strikes grew violent after water, food, electricity, and medicine were withheld from the strikers and police surrounded the building. Strikers threw Molotov cocktails at police while police used electroshock weapons and allegedly dropped corrosive chemicals on the strikers. On 14 August 2009, worker strikes finished at the SsangYong factory and production commenced again after 77 days of disruption. Company employees and analysts have also blamed SAIC for stealing technology related to hybrid vehicles from the company and failing to live up to its promise of continued investment. SAIC denied allegations of technology theft by the company&#x27;s employees. However, SAIC was charged by the South Korean prosecutor&#x27;s office for violating company regulations and the South Korean law when it ordered and carried out the transfer of SsangYong&#x27;s proprietary technology developed with South Korean government funding over to SAIC researchers.

In 2010, Daewoo Motor Sales was dropped by General Motors. The long-time dealership partner then signed a deal with the SsangYong Motor Company to supply new vehicles to sell (specifically the Rodius, Chairman W and Chairman H), in return for the injection of ($17.6 million) into the car maker still recovering from bankruptcy. The deal is non-exclusive, meaning SsangYong will also sell vehicles through private dealers.

==== Takeover by Mahindra Automotive ====
In April 2010, the company released a statement citing interest of three to four local and foreign companies in acquiring SsangYong Motor Company, resulting in shares rising by 15%. The companies were later revealed to be Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Ruia Group, SM Aluminum, Seoul Investments and French-owned Renault Samsung Motors of South Korea. In August 2010, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Limited was chosen as the preferred bidder for SsangYong. The acquisition was completed in February 2011 and cost Mahindra US$463.6 million.

In 2015, SsangYong and KB Capital established a joint venture as the financial affiliate of the former, with the name SY Auto Capital. SsangYong had a 51% stake of the venture and KB Capital a 49%. That year, the company launched the Tivoli, its first car after Mahindra acquisition. Within a year of Tivoli&#x27;s launch, the company reported its first net profit in 9 years. In 2017, SsangYong sold 106,677 units in domestic sales and 37,008 units in exports, setting a record high in 14 years since 2003, when its annual domestic sales stood at 131,283 units. Out of this, the Tivoli alone contributed over 50,000 units of domestic sales for the company. Mahindra XUV300, which was later launched in 2019 is built on Tivoli&#x27;s platform, sharing many parts including several metal sheets.

Mahindra also worked with its SsangYong subsidiary to introduce high performance electric vehicles in South Korea for mass-market sales. Mahindra and SsangYong increased their collaboration on engines and electric cars.

On 21 December 2020, SsangYong Motor filed for receivership after Mahindra cut funding to SsangYong due to its outstanding debt. Ssang Yong Motor spokesperson stated that the company owes a total of 315.3 billion won (US$285 million) in overdue debt to financial institutions.

==== Failed takeover by Edison Motors ====
In October 2021, it was reported that SsangYong was set to be acquired by electric bus and truck maker Edison Motors which would lead to SsangYong exiting receivership. Edison Motors planned to introduce SsangYong vehicles into the United States, Mexico, and Canada markets by the mid-2020s. Edison Motors also intended to phase-out production and new car sales of fossil fuel-powered SsangYong vehicles by 2030, in favor of producing and selling only electric-powered vehicles by the latter, if acquired. In January 2022, the South Korean courts &quot;approved&quot; Edison Motors&#x27; acquisition plan, although the company would be kept in receivership until the transaction were completed. In March 2022, SsangYong said the Edison Motors takeover was cancelled as the latter failed making acquisition payments for that month.

In December 2021, SsangYong signed an agreement with the Chinese BYD Auto to co-develop battery systems for its first electric car (called U100) which would be launched in 2023.

====Takeover by the KG Group====
In June 2022, the Seoul Bankruptcy Court opted for a consortium (KG Mobility) led by the KG Group as the final bidder to take over SsangYong Motor. The consortium planned to pay 900 billion won ($699.5 million) for SsangYong. In August 2022, South Korea&#x27;s Free Trade Commission approved KG Group acquisition of a 61% majority stake in SsangYong through the consortium. The acquisition payments were completed later that month. In September 2022, the Seoul Bankruptcy Court agreed to SsangYong&#x27;s receivership exit plan, including issuing new shares in order to pay the creditors. The KG Group was set to start the process to exit SsangYong&#x27;s receivership in early October and finish the acquisition process on (or before) 14 October, the SsangYong sale deadline. 
There also were plans to rename SsangYong. After delays, the consortium started the receivership exit procedures on 31 October by requesting the receivership termination to the Seoul Bankruptcy Court. The Court approved the receivership exit on 11 November, finalising the consortium&#x27;s acquisition.

In December 2022, SsangYong&#x27;s chairman Kwak Jae-sun said it planned to remove the &quot;SsangYong&quot; name entirely in March 2023 by modifying the articles of association. The company was set to be renamed as &quot;KG Mobility&quot;, adopting a new branding and using KG as its marque, to avoid the negative perception of the present name, bypassing its &quot;painful image&quot;.

=== KG Mobility (2023–present)===
The company adopted the name KG Mobility in March 2023. As the company was renamed, its financial affiliate, SY Auto Capital, was also renamed as KG Capital. In May 2023, KG Group&#x27;s KG Inicis acquired the 49% KG Capital stake hold by KB Capital and 6% of KG Mobility&#x27;s share, leaving the latter with a 45% and KG Inicis with a 55%.

The company is developing plans to use technology to gain competitivity on various market segments (especially electric) and enter less developed overseas markets with potential growth (such as Africa, Southeast Asia, South America, or the Middle East) to expand its sales base. In 2022, the company signed a knock-down kit (KD) assembly contract with the Saudi National Automotive Manufacturing Company. In January 2023, it signed another KD contract with NGT, a company from the United Arab Emirates. In March 2023, a third with Vietnamese Kim Long Motors.

In March 2023, KG Mobility launched a bid to acquire receivership-bound Edison Motors. In May, it was selected as the preferred bidder. In June, it was reported that SsangYong would be relaunched in Europe under the name KGM, with the cars continuing to wear SsangYong&#x27;s dragon wing logo on the front. It is thought that the first KGM car in Europe will be a facelifted version of the SsangYong Tivoli, with their range of SUVs being rebranded soon after.

In April 2023, KG Mobility launched KG S&amp;C, a vehicle parts and conversion division.

In November 2023, it was announced that the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) had rejected the application to register the brand name because it had already been registered in around 30 countries by Cihan Turan. This company is known as a trademark troll. This refers to the registration of brand names without the intention of actually using them, but only in order to exploit the rights and collect the corresponding payments. KG Mobility appealed against this decision and said it would continue to use the KGM name in overseas markets until further notice.

In June 2024, however, &quot;The Korea Times&quot; reported that KG Mobility was facing difficulties in obtaining the trademark rights for the three-letter abbreviation &quot;KGM&quot;. The Turkish Patent and Trademark Office even refused the registration of KGM, because the Turkish government-run General Directorate of Highways, which is written as &quot;Karayolları Genel Müdürlüğü&quot; in Turkish, had been already using the same acronym. The registration of KG Mobility had also been rejected in the country due to Cihan Turan. Even in Korea, the trademark for KGM is also under KIPO’s review, following an objection filed in 2023 by KTM, an Austrian motorcycle manufacturer, which claims consumers are likely to be confused by the two similar acronyms.

In August 2024, KG Mobility said it has established a sales subsidiary in Germany to strengthen its operations in the European market.

In October 2024, KG Mobility announced that it has signed a strategic partnership co-operation agreement with China&#x27;s Chery Automobile.

==Corporate==
===Ownership===
By April 2023, the controlling shareholder of KG Mobility was KG Mobility Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of KG ETS (a KG Group affiliate). In August 2023, KG Mobility Holdings was merged into KG ETS, making KG Mobility a direct subsidiary of the latter. KG ETS holds a 58.84% of KG Mobility and it cannot sell its stake to third parties until April 2026.

In September 2023, it said it plans to sell the present site&#x27;s land to finance the construction of a new factory in the Pyeongtaek city area, which is set to start in 2024. The new factory is set to have capacity to assemble up to 300,000 vehicles per year in a more integrated way (avoiding the production bottlenecks of the present, older style facility).The new factory would be fully operational by 2028.

<text>A tankette is a tracked armoured fighting vehicle that resembles a small tank, roughly the size of a car. It is mainly intended for light infantry support and scouting. Colloquially it may also simply mean a small tank.
Several countries built tankettes between the 1920s and 1940s, and some saw limited combat in the early phases of World War II. The vulnerability of their light armour, however, eventually led armies to abandon the concept with some exceptions such as the more modern German Wiesel (Weasel) series.

==Characteristics==
Tankettes were made both in two- and three-man models. Some were so low that the occupant had to lie prone. Some models were not equipped with turrets (and together with the tracked mobility, this is often seen as defining the concept), or just a very simple turret that was traversed by hand or leg. They were significantly smaller than light tanks and did not have a tank gun; instead their main weapon tended to be one or two machine guns or, rarely, a 20 mm autocannon or grenade launcher.

==History==
The genesis of the tankette concept was the armoured warfare of World War I. On the Western Front in the later stage of the war, Allied tanks could break through the enemy trench lines but the infantry (needed to take and hold the ground gained) following the tanks were easily stopped or delayed by small arms fire and artillery. The breakthrough tanks were then isolated and destroyed, and reinforcements plugged the hole in the trench line. The tankette was originally conceived in the early interwar period to solve this problem. The first designs were a sort of mobile, one-man machine gun nest protected against small arms fire and shell fragments. This idea was abandoned and the two man-model, mainly intended for reconnaissance, was produced instead. The moving up of infantry while protecting them was solved with the development of the armoured personnel carrier concept in the 1930s.

In 1925 British tank pioneer Giffard Le Quesne Martel built a one-man tank in his garage and showed it to the War Office, who agreed to production of a few (known as the Morris-Martel) for testing. The publicity caused John Carden and Vivian Loyd to produce their own. Both types were developed further, but the two-man Carden Loyd tankette was considered the classic and most successful design, with many other tankettes modelled after it. While the design was influential, few Carden Loyd tankettes saw combat, other than those the Bolivian side used during the Chaco War. However, the design did lead to the &#x27;Bren Gun Carrier&#x27; which in final form as the Universal Carrier had an extensive operational history in the Second World War. In 1928, the British Army Council objected to the use of the word &quot;tankette,&quot; noting that the &quot;mechanization of the Army&quot; was still in its infancy.

The Italian Royal Army (&quot;Regio Esercito&quot;) equipped three armoured divisions and three &quot;fast&quot; (&quot;celere&quot;) divisions with L3/33 and L3/35 tankettes. The L3s were used in large numbers during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the Spanish Civil War, and almost every place Italian soldiers fought during World War II. Some L3s went with the Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia (&quot;Corpo di Spedizione Italiano&quot;, CSIR) as late as Operation Barbarossa.

The French armoured reconnaissance type (&quot;automitrailleuses de reconnaissance&quot;, &quot;machine-gun scout&quot;) of the 1930s was essentially a tankette in form, specifically intended for scouting ahead of the main force.

In 1935, the Soviets experimented with transporting T-27s by air, suspending one under the fuselage of a Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber.
The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) became one of the most prolific users of tankettes, producing a number of designs for reconnaissance and infantry support in Second Sino-Japanese War and jungle warfare. However, by the time of the Second World War, many were already obsolete and some were proven unsuccessful in their appointed task. Many were relegated to tractor duties for artillery or logistics units.

Due to their limited utility and vulnerability to anti-tank weapons (even machine guns), the tankette concept was abandoned, and their role largely taken over by armoured cars.

However, in Vietnam, the US Marines employed the similar, somewhat larger, M50 Ontos tank destroyer with some success.

The 1980s saw the renaissance of a similar concept in the German Wiesel AWC, introduced to provide airborne troops with armoured reconnaissance capability; while these are called &quot;armoured weapons carriers&quot;, they fit the definition of a tankette.

<text>Jeremy Steig (September 23, 1942 – April 13, 2016) was an American jazz flutist.

==Biography==
Steig was born in Manhattan, the son of Jewish &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoonist William Steig and Elizabeth (Mead) Steig, head of the fine arts department at Lesley College. Steig was a maternal nephew of Margaret Mead and Leo Rosten, and was also the cousin of Mary Catherine Bateson.

Steig began flute studies from age 11. He was taught by Page Brooks of the New York Philharmonic. By the age of 15, he was playing jazz professionally in Greenwich Village coffee houses. He came to the attention of music producer and critic John Henry Hammond, a Greenwich resident who would go on to produce Steig`s debut album, Flute Fever (Steig consequently created the album`s cover art).

In 1962, Steig was involved in a motorcycle accident which left his face paralyzed with loss of hearing in one ear. Despite an operation, the right side of his face was still partially paralyzed leaving him unable to play flute. He took up drawing and contemplated becoming a muralist where he could make a steady living. According to Steig, he took one &quot;tortured&quot; week to decide whether to be musician again.
Upon deciding to become a musician full-time, he crafted a &quot;blinder-like&quot; mouthpiece which he inserted into his mouth to blow air. He relied on this device in order to play flute.

Steig also composed the music for animated film adaptations of his father&#x27;s books for Weston Woods, including &quot;The Amazing Bone&quot;, &quot;Brave Irene&quot; and &quot;Sylvester and the Magic Pebble&quot;.

His song &quot;Howlin&#x27; For Judy&quot;, from his 1970 album &quot;Legwork&quot;, was sampled in the Beastie Boys&#x27; 1994 single &quot;Sure Shot&quot;, providing the main instrumental part of the song.

Steig performed the role of &quot;The Pied Piper&quot;, exclusively on flute, in the film &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot;, based on the character created by his father.

He lived in Japan with his wife Asako. He died in Yokohama from cancer on April 13, 2016. Four years after his death, Byroad Press published his memoir, &quot;Get Me Out of Here&quot;, fulfilling his final wish. The book is illustrated with Jeremy&#x27;s ink drawings and, at his request, contains three final chapters and an epilogue by Asako.

<text>Aga Khan (; ; also transliterated as &quot;Aqa Khan&quot; and &quot;Agha Khan&quot;) is a title held by the Imām of the Nizari Ismāʿīli Shias. From 1957 to 2025, the holder of the title was the 49th Imām, Prince Shah Karim al-Husseini, Aga Khan IV (1936–2025). The current holder of the title is the 50th Imām, Prince Rahim Aga Khan, Aga Khan V.

==Title==
The title is made up of the titles &quot;agha&quot; and &quot;khan&quot;. The Turkish &quot;agha&quot; is &quot;aqa&quot; (Āqā) in Persian. The word &quot;agha&quot; comes from the Old Turkic and Mongolian &quot;aqa&quot;, meaning &quot;elder men&quot;, and means something like &quot;master&quot; or &quot;lord&quot;. &quot;Khan&quot; means king or ruler in Turkish and Mongolian languages. Combining the terms together the title means commanding chief, lord, or master.

According to Farhad Daftary, a scholar of the Isma&#x27;ili movement, &quot;Aga Khan&quot; is an honorific title bestowed on Hasan Ali Shah (1804–1881), the 46th Imām of Nizari Ismai&#x27;lis (1817–1881), by the Iranian king Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. The Aga Khan III noted in a famous legal proceeding in India that &quot;Aga Khan&quot; is not a title but instead an alias that was given to the Aga Khan I when he was a young man.

==History==
During the latter stages of the First Anglo-Afghan War (1841–1842), Hasan Ali Shah and his cavalry officers provided assistance to General Nott in Kandahar Province and to General England in his advance from Sindh to join Nott. For these and for other diligent efforts made by him in the service of the Empire, the British Raj recognised him as a &quot;Prince&quot;; it was not an uncommon practice for the British to consolidate their hold on India by handing out similar titles liberally to any large landowner or tribal chieftain with local influence who made himself useful to them.

The Aga Khan was exceptional in that, while it was the local tribal influence that had enabled him to serve the British and gain their favour, his claim to nobility was based upon his claim to leadership of an entire sect of Islam. Imperial Britain saw great possibilities in having under their control and patronage the head of a major Shia sect; it could even be used at some later stage to counterbalance the influence of the Ottoman Caliph, the head of Islam as recognized by the Sunni sects. The Aga Khan was the only religious or community leader in British India granted a personal gun salute.

When Hasan Ali Shah, the first Aga Khan, came to Sindh (which is now in Pakistan) from Afghanistan, he and his army were welcomed by Mir Nasir Khan Noori of Baluchistan. In 1866, the Aga Khan won a court victory in the High Court of Bombay in what popularly became known as the Aga Khan Case, securing his recognition by the British government as the head of the Khoja community. The Aga Khan is also the Pir within the Nizari Ismaili community.

The Bombay High Court decision of 1866 recognized Aga Khan I as the hereditary Imām of Isma&#x27;ilis.

In 1887, the Secretary of State for India, acting through the Viceroy of India, formally recognized the title &quot;Aga Khan&quot;.

==List of Aga Khans==
Five Ismāʿīli imāms have held this title:
*Aga Khan I – Hasan Ali Shah Mahallati (1804–1881), 46th Imam of Nizari Ismailis (1817–1881)
*Aga Khan II – Shah Ali Shah (about 1830–1885), 47th Imam of Nizari Ismailis (12 April 1881 – 17 August 1885)
*Aga Khan III – Sir Sultan Mohammed Shah (1877–1957), 48th Imam of Nizari Ismailis (17 August 1885 – 11 July 1957)
*Aga Khan IV – Prince Shah Karim Al-Hussaini (1936–2025), 49th Imam of Nizari Ismailis (11 July 1957 – 4 February 2025)
*Aga Khan V – Prince Shah Rahim Al-Hussaini (born 1971), 50th Imam of Nizari Ismailis (4 February 2025 – present)

<doc id="351216" wikidata="Q2718735" url="?curid=351216" title="Stripboard">
<text>Stripboard is the generic name for a widely used type of electronics prototyping material for circuit boards characterized by a pre-formed regular (rectangular) grid of holes, with wide parallel strips of copper cladding running in one direction all the way along one side of an insulating bonded paper board. It is commonly also known by the name of the original product Veroboard, which is a trademark, in the UK, of British company Vero Technologies Ltd and Canadian company Pixel Print Ltd. It was originated and developed in the early 1960s by the Electronics Department of Vero Precision Engineering Ltd (VPE). It was introduced as a general-purpose material for use in constructing electronic circuits - differing from purpose-designed printed circuit boards (PCBs) in that a variety of electronics circuits may be constructed using a standard wiring board.

In using the board, breaks are made in the tracks, usually around holes, to divide the strips into multiple electrical nodes. With care, it is possible to break between holes to allow for components that have two pin rows only one position apart such as twin row headers for IDCs.

Stripboard is not designed for surface-mount components, though it is possible to mount many such components on the track side, particularly if tracks are cut/shaped with a knife or small cutting disc in a rotary tool.

The first single-size Veroboard product was the forerunner of the numerous types of prototype wiring board which, with worldwide use over five decades, have become known as stripboard.

The generic terms &#x27;veroboard&#x27; and &#x27;stripboard&#x27; are now taken to be synonymous.

== History ==
By the mid-1950s, the printed circuit board (PCB) had become commonplace in electronics production.

In early 1959, the VPE Electronics Department was formed when managing director Geoffrey Verdon-Roe hired two former Saunders-Roe Ltd employees, Peter H Winter (aircraft design department) and Terry Fitzpatrick (electronics division).

After the failure of a project to develop machine tool control equipment, the department remained operative as a result of success with the invention and development of the new material.

New equipment using PCBs was displayed at the 1959 Radio and Electronics Components Manufacturers Federation (RECMF) Exhibition held in The Dorchester Hotel, Park Lane, London.

The usual configuration for most of the PCBs of that time had components placed in a regular pattern with the circuit formed by maze-like conductive pathways. An interesting alternative, proposed by Fitzpatrick after visiting the RECMF Exhibition on behalf of VPE, envisaged a standard circuit board carrying straight-line conductors on which the components could be suitably dispersed and connected to the conductors to produce the required circuit.

A patent application was immediately filed 25 May 1959 and the invention was developed for Vero by associates Winter, Fitzpatrick and machine shop engineers.

The advent of the Arduino integrated development environment, designed to introduce computer programming to newcomers unfamiliar with software development, presents a new opportunity to use Veroboard. Arduino development regularly involves the use of &#x27;shields&#x27;, which plug into the main Arduino board using standard 0.1 in header connections and carry project-specific I/O hardware. However the Arduino design makes this difficult, as one of the four header sockets is offset from the 0.1 in spacing of the others by 0.05 in.

The British company Vero Technologies Ltd currently holds the UK trademark for Veroboard. In the Americas the Veroboard trademark is now held by the Canadian company Pixel Print Ltd. of Vancouver.

== Hole spacing ==

Stripboard holes are drilled on centers. This spacing allows components having pins with a spacing to be inserted. Compatible parts include DIP ICs, sockets for ICs, some types of connectors, and other devices.

Stripboards have evolved over time into several variants and related products. For example, a larger version using a 0.15 inch (3.81 mm) grid and larger holes is available, but is generally less popular (presumably because it does not match up with standard IC pin spacing).

== Board dimensions ==
Stripboard is available in a variety of sizes.

== Assemblies ==
The components are usually placed on the plain side of the board, with their leads protruding through the holes. The leads are then soldered to the copper tracks on the other side of the board to make the desired connections, and any excess wire is cut off. The continuous tracks may be easily and neatly cut as desired to form breaks between conductors using a twist drill, a hand cutter made for the purpose, or a knife. Tracks may be linked up on either side of the board using wire. With practice, very neat and reliable assemblies can be created, though such a method is labour-intensive and therefore unsuitable for production assemblies except in very small quantity.

External wire connections to the board are made either by soldering the wires through the holes or, for wires too thick to pass through the holes, by soldering them to specially made pins called Veropins which fit tightly into the holes. Alternatively, some types of connectors have a suitable pin spacing to be inserted directly into the board.

== Production ==

Production of the proposed new product, Veroboard, was undertaken by the VPE machine tool department.

Bought-in sheets of 1.6 mm (0.06 in) copper-clad SRBP printed circuit material were cut to give 122 mm x 456 mm (4.8 in x 18 in) size boards with the individual boards then being machined to form the final product according to the original Veroboard specification. A multiple milling cutter tool, which comprised a bank of side-and-face cutters with suitably shaped cutting teeth, was fabricated, to be used in removing part of the bonded copper on each board leaving 21 conductive strips.

For a second operation a special tool with 63 hardened punch bits 1.35 mm (0.052 in) in diameter mounted on a solid base block was constructed to repeat-punch a matrix of holes, on spacing, through the copper strips and the base board.

Many dimensional, material quality, and tooling problems were encountered before finished boards of acceptable quality could be produced in quantity. These machining problems were encountered due to the non-availability, in 1960, of advanced printed circuit board milling and drilling techniques or facilities for chemical milling (etching) the copper strips.

In 1961, as production rates improved with experience, Vero Electronics Ltd was formed as a separate company to market the increasing sales of Veroboard.

== Use ==


As with other stripboards, in using Veroboard, components are suitably positioned and soldered to the conductors to form the required circuit. Breaks can be made in the tracks, usually around holes, to divide the strips into multiple electrical nodes enabling increased circuit complexity.

This type of wiring board may be used for initial electronic circuit development, to construct prototypes for bench testing or in the production of complete electronic units in small quantity.

Veroboard was first used for prototype construction within Vero Electronics Department in 1961. The images of a binary decade counter sub-unit clearly show both the assembled components and the copper conductors with the required discontinuities.

A number of these sub-units were interconnected through connectors mounted on a motherboard similar to that shown in the Veroboard Display image and comprised a very early PCB-based backplane system. Each sub-unit had a digital capacity equivalent to byte of data storage - i.e. 2,000,000 would be required to store 1 megabyte.

Two forms of Veroboard are produced with hole pitch of 2.54 mm (0.1 in) or 3.5 mm (0.15 in). The larger pitch is and was considered easier to assemble, especially at a time when many constructors were still more familiar with valves and tag strips.

The increasingly popular integrated circuits in dual in-line packages would only fit the 0.1 boards. Very soon 0.1 pitch became by far the dominant form. Integrated circuits and the common layout of short parallel strips protruding from the sides of an IC package encouraged the development of specialist boards such as Verostrip. This was a long, thin board with the copper strips arranged transversely, rather than the usual lengthwise. A ready-cut central gap was provided to isolate the sides of the IC.

A 1979 Vero Electronics Ltd production drawing shows a special Veroboard product made for RS Components Ltd. The versatility of the veroboard/stripboard type of product is demonstrated by the large number of design examples currently () to be found on the Internet.

== Variations ==

Stripboard is available from many vendors. All versions have copper strips on one side. Some are made using printed circuit board etching and drilling techniques, although some have milled strips and punched holes. The original Veroboard used FR-2 synthetic-resin-bonded paper (SRBP) (also known as phenolic board) as the base board material. Some versions of stripboard now use higher quality FR-4 (fiberglass-reinforced epoxy laminate) material.

== Comparison with other systems ==


For high density prototyping, especially of digital circuits, wire wrap is faster and more reliable than Stripboard for experienced personnel.

Veroboard is similar in concept and usage to a plug-in breadboard, but is cheaper and more permanent—connections are soldered and while some limited reuse may be possible, more than a few cycles of soldering and desoldering are likely to render both the components and the board unusable. In contrast, breadboard connections are held by friction, and the breadboard can be reused many times. However, a breadboard is not very suitable for prototyping that needs to remain in a set configuration for an appreciable period of time nor for physical mock-ups containing a working circuit or for any environment subject to vibration or movement.

Stripboards have further evolved into a larger class of prototype boards, available in different shapes and sizes, with different conductive trace layouts.

For example, one variant is called a TriPad board. This is similar to stripboard, except that the conductive tracks do not run continuously along the board but are broken into sections, each of which spans three holes. This allows the legs of two or three components to be easily linked together in the circuit conveniently without the need for track breaks to be made. However, in order to link more than three holes together, wire links or bridges must be formed and this can result in a less compact layout than is possible with ordinary stripboard.

Another variant is Perf+. This is best described as a selective stripboard. Instead of having all the holes connected together in a strip, a Perf+ board can have holes connected to the bus using a small dab of solder. On the other side the busses run in another direction, allowing compact layouts of complicated circuits by passing signals over each other on different layers of the board.

Other prototype board variants have generic layouts to simplify building prototypes with integrated circuits, typically in DIP shapes, or with transistors (pads forming triangles). In particular, some boards mimic the layout of breadboards, to simplify moving a non-permanent prototype on a breadboard to a permanent construction on a PCB. Some types of boards have patterns for connectors on the periphery, like DB9 or IDC headers, to allow connectors with non-standard pin spacings to be easily used. Some come in special physical shapes, to be used to prototype plug-in boards for computer bus systems.

<text>Donald Thomas Brash (born 24 September 1940) is a former New Zealand politician who was Leader of the Opposition and leader of the New Zealand National Party from October 2003 to November 2006, and leader of the ACT New Zealand party for seven months from April to November 2011.

Brash was Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for fourteen years from 1988 to April 2002. He resigned to stand as a list MP for the National Party in the 2002 general election. Brash was ranked high on the party list and so was elected, despite the Bill English-led National Party being heavily defeated. Brash challenged English&#x27;s leadership position the next year, and was elected head of the party on 28 October 2003. He delivered a speech at Orewa on 27 January 2004 that proved controversial, expressing opposition to perceived Māori separatism, through New Zealand&#x27;s measures designed to benefit them.

In the 2005 general election, the National Party made major gains under Brash&#x27;s leadership and achieved its best result (at that time) since the introduction of the mixed-member proportional electoral system in 1996 – recovering from its worst ever result in 2002. However, National won two seats fewer than the incumbent New Zealand Labour Party, and was unable to secure a majority from the minor parties to form a government. Brash resigned as party leader on 27 November 2006, and retired from Parliament in February 2007.

In October 2008, he was appointed as an adjunct professor of Banking in the Business School at the Auckland University of Technology, and an adjunct professor in the School of Economics and Finance at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia.

On 28 April 2011, Brash joined ACT (a libertarian party) as its leader, replacing Rodney Hide. He resigned as leader on the night of the 2011 general election in November due to ACT&#x27;s poor showing in the election, and its failure to gain any seats apart from its electorate strong-hold of . In 2016, he founded the right-wing lobby group Hobson&#x27;s Pledge, to seek to nullify the partnership between Māori and the Crown, and further oppose equitable measures for Māori.

== Childhood, education and marriage ==
Don Brash was born to Alan Brash, a Presbyterian minister and son of prominent lay leader Thomas Brash, and Eljean Brash (née Hill), in Whanganui on 24 September 1940.

His family moved to Christchurch when he was six. He attended Cashmere Primary School and Christchurch Boys&#x27; High School before going to the University of Canterbury where he graduated in economics, history and political science. He continued his studies in economics, receiving his master&#x27;s degree in 1962 for a thesis arguing that foreign investment damaged a country&#x27;s economic development. The following year he began working towards a PhD (again in economics, at the Australian National University), which reached the opposite conclusion.
In 1964 Brash married his first wife, Erica, with whom he had two children. In the 1980s he and his Singaporean secretary, Je Lan Lee, entered into a relationship. Both were married at the time. He separated from his first wife in 1985 and four months after they were divorced he married Lee. In 2007, his second marriage also broke up, following an affair with Diane Foreman, then Deputy Chair of the Business Round Table. Brash and Lee had one child together.

== Early career ==
Brash went to Washington, D.C. in the United States in 1966 to work as an economist for the World Bank. However, he returned to New Zealand in 1971 to become general manager of Broadbank Corporation, a merchant bank.

Brash&#x27;s first entry into politics came in 1980 when the National Party selected him to stand as its candidate in the by-election in the East Coast Bays electorate. Brash&#x27;s attempt at the seat, however, failed – some believe that this resulted from the decision by Robert Muldoon, National Party Prime Minister, to raise tolls on the Auckland Harbour Bridge, an important route for East Coast Bays residents. The seat went to Gary Knapp of the Social Credit Party. Brash again failed to win the seat at the 1981 general election.

In 1982 Brash became managing director at the New Zealand Kiwifruit Authority, which oversaw the export of kiwifruit (he grows kiwifruit as a hobby). From 1986 to 1988, he served as the general manager of Trust Bank, a merger of nine trustee savings banks.

== Reserve Bank governor ==

In 1988 Brash became governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, a position which he held for the next 14 years. Brash consistently met Government-set targets to keep inflation within initially 0 to 2%, later 1 to 3% during his time as governor, and during his tenure interest-rates dropped from double-digit to single-digit percentages.

Aside from monetary policy, Brash presided over significant changes in banking supervision, with the New Zealand approach emphasising public disclosure by banks regarding the nature of their assets and liabilities. Under his governorship, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand established a new model of the relationship between government and central bank – not totally independent, like the Bundesbank in Germany, and not dominated by government, as was typical of most central banks at the time, but one where government and central bank agreed in public about the inflation rate to be delivered by the central bank, where the central bank had full independence to run monetary policy to deliver that, and where the central bank&#x27;s governor was held accountable for the inflation outcome. It was the Reserve Bank Act 1989 which established this contractual relationship (based on price stability targets) between the Bank and the Government, rather than giving direct control to Ministers of Finance.

Changes took place in the currency used in New Zealand during Brash&#x27;s tenure, notably the introduction of polymer banknotes, and the replacement of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s face on most of the banknotes. , many banknotes in circulation still carry the signature of Brash from his term as governor.

There is a range of opinion on Brash&#x27;s performance as Reserve Bank governor. The New Zealand Association of Economists describe Brash&#x27;s success in establishing an independent central bank with an inflation target and in reducing inflation as a highlight of his career. Documentary maker Alister Barry described Brash as &quot;an extremist, an idealist&quot; whose &quot;ideal world is where the free market reigns supreme&quot;. Barry considered that Brash manipulated public opinion towards neo-liberal economics and gave as examples Brash&#x27;s advocacy for abolishing the minimum wage and his Hayek Memorial Lecture to the Institute of Economic Affairs in London in 1996.

In 1990, Brash was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In 2002, he was inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame, in recognition of his role as central bank governor.

== Member of Parliament ==


On 26 April 2002, shortly before the 2002 general election, Brash resigned as Reserve Bank governor to stand as a candidate for Parliament on the National Party list. The Party ranked him in fifth place on its party list. Most unusually among National candidates, he stood as a list candidate without running for an electorate seat. Though National had its worst performance ever, gaining only 21% of the party vote, Brash&#x27;s high place on the party list assured him of a seat in Parliament.

Brash immediately joined National&#x27;s front bench as its spokesman on finance. This placed him opposite the Labour Party&#x27;s Michael Cullen, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister. Commentators generally praised Brash for his knowledge of economics, but expressed criticism of his inexperience in terms of political leadership.

In October 2003, Brash publicly challenged Bill English for the position of Parliamentary Leader of the National Party. English had gradually lost support within the party, but Brash&#x27;s victory in any leadership-contest against English seemed by no means guaranteed. Brash&#x27;s decision to make his challenge public caused some criticism, with some party supporters perceiving that an open leadership dispute could damage the party&#x27;s image. However, by breaking with the tradition of operating secretly, Brash calculated that people would see him as an honest &quot;anti-politician&quot; – a notion central to his personal brand. After leading National to its worst-ever election result in 2002, English was sacked the following year in favor of Don Brash.

== Leader of the Opposition ==

Brash won a caucus vote on 28 October 2003, making him Leader of the National Party Caucus (and thus Leader of the Opposition) after one year as a Member of Parliament. He remained National&#x27;s finance spokesman, appointing the equally new MP John Key as his deputy finance-spokesman, and eventually appointing Key the primary finance-spokesman after a Caucus reshuffle in August 2004.

=== Orewa speech ===

On 27 January 2004 Brash delivered his second Orewa speech on &quot;Nationhood&quot; at the Orewa Rotary Club, north of Auckland, expressing opposition to perceived &quot;Māori racial separatism&quot; in New Zealand:
The topic I will focus on today is the dangerous drift towards racial separatism in New Zealand, and the development of the now entrenched Treaty grievance industry. We are one country with many peoples, not simply a society of Pākehā and Māori where the minority has a birthright to the upper hand, as the Labour Government seems to believe&quot;.[...]
Though the sentiments expressed in the Orewa speech differed little from established National Party views (as voiced previously by Bill English, for example), these comments resulted in National receiving an unprecedented boost in a public opinion poll. National gained 17 percentage points in the February 2004 Colmar Brunton poll for Television New Zealand, taken shortly after the speech. The surge in National support marked the biggest single gain by a political party in a single poll in Colmar Brunton&#x27;s polling history at that point. In the months that followed, changes of emphasis in Labour&#x27;s policy agenda became apparent as Labour attempted to recoup the ground lost to National in the February poll.

Shortly after the delivery of the Orewa speech, his Māori Affairs spokesperson Georgina te Heuheu resigned because she would not publicly support his speech.

After the February peak, National suffered a steady decline in public opinion polls, leaving it 11 points behind Labour at the end of 2004.

In 2004, following a political speech given by the Prime Minister Helen Clark inside the Christchurch Cathedral, Brash wrote to the dean of the cathedral, Peter Beck. In his letter he criticised Clark&#x27;s use of a church-venue for delivering a political speech, and he raised questions over her views on religion and on the institution of marriage. After Clark retaliated, Brash apologised for any offence that his comments had caused to her, and revealed that his chief of staff, Richard Long, had written the letter, not Brash himself.

On 25 January 2005 Brash made his third speech to the Orewa Rotary Club (his first had come in the final week of January 2003, while still National&#x27;s finance spokesman). This time Brash focussed on &quot;Welfare Dependency: Whatever Happened to Personal Responsibility?&quot; Brash pledged to reduce the number of working-age beneficiaries from the current figure of 300,000 to 200,000 over ten years, and he dedicated a significant part of his speech to the Domestic Purposes Benefit. At the time approximately 109,000 single parents received the DPB, costing taxpayers about $1.5 billion a year. Brash noted that since the inception of the DPB in 1974, the population of New Zealand had increased by 30% while the numbers receiving the DPB had increased almost ninefold. Brash used the speech to highlight his views on both the fiscal and social costs of entrenched welfare-dependency:
How can we tolerate a welfare system which allows children to grow up in a household where the parents are permanently dependent on a welfare benefit? Our welfare system is contributing to the creation of a generation of children condemned to a lifetime of deprivation, with limited education, without life skills, and without the most precious inheritance from their parents, a sense of ambition or aspiration. Nothing can be more destructive of self esteem.
Brash proposed a number of ways to reduce welfare dependency and to refocus the DPB back to its original intent of giving aid to single-parent families in need or in danger. These proposals included enforcing child-support payments from absent fathers, requiring single parents to work or perform community services once their children reached school age, and introducing penalties for women seeking the DPB who refused to name the father of their child. He also acknowledged adoption as an acceptable option, particularly for teenage girls, and drew attention to the growth in numbers of single mothers giving birth to additional children while already receiving the single-parent DPB benefit.

Some elements of the speech put his Social Welfare spokesperson, Katherine Rich, at odds with Brash, and he fired her from the portfolio, promoting the MP for Clevedon, Judith Collins, in her place.

=== Views on race-relations ===

==== Māori identity ====

After the Orewa speech of 2004, Brash&#x27;s public statements on race relations received significant attention, both in the traditional media and online. During the 2005 election campaign, he criticised the use of &quot;pōwhiri&quot; in welcoming international visitors:
I mean, I think there is a place for Maori culture but why is it that we always use a semi-naked male, sometimes quite pale-skinned Māori, leaping around in, you know, mock battle?
In September 2006 Brash stated that:
There are clearly many New Zealanders who do see themselves as distinctly and distinctively Māori – but it is also clear there are few, if any, fully Māori left here. There has been a lot of intermarriage and that has been welcome.
These comments received a negative response from other political leaders, who portrayed focussing on blood quantum as divisive and as harking back to racist laws, and who suggested the appropriateness for Māori themselves to determine how to define themselves.

Brash questioned whether Māori remained a distinct indigenous group because few &quot;full-blooded&quot; individuals survive. This drew criticism from a range of his adversaries, including Māori Party co-leader Tariana Turia, who cancelled a dinner with him in protest. In a statement to explain his position on 30 September 2006, Brash said that the Government had no responsibility to address the over-representation of Māori in negative social statistics. &quot;If Māori New Zealanders die more frequently from lung cancer than non-Māori do, for example, it is almost certainly because Māori New Zealanders choose to smoke more heavily than other New Zealanders do&quot;.

==== British heritage ====
Brash stressed the significance of New Zealand&#x27;s British heritage. When asked &quot;who are the ideal immigrants?&quot;, Brash made the following statement;

:British immigrants fit in here very well. My own ancestry is all British. New Zealand values are British values, derived from centuries of struggle since Magna Carta. Those things make New Zealand the society it is.

== 2005 general election ==

In July 2005, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced that a General Election would take place on 17 September. At that time Brash and the National Party led by a slim margin in the opinion-polls. But by mid-August both Brash and National had declined in popularity. Commentators attributed this trend to a series of announcements of new spending programs by Labour, and to confusion as to whether National could form a stable coalition government with New Zealand First and/or ACT New Zealand.

The National Party advertising campaign aimed at rebutting arguments brought up by Labour about a variety of themes: Brash&#x27;s stand on national security issues (he favoured greater co-operation with &quot;traditional allies&quot;), his commitment to social security programmes (including healthcare), as well as his ideas on the perceived drift towards &quot;racial separatism&quot; dividing Māori from other New Zealanders. One of Brash&#x27;s most significant and widely publicised policy announcements foreshadowed the introduction of tax-cuts for working New Zealanders. Brash&#x27;s party embarked on a targeted billboard-advertising programme, which later (post-election) won two advertising-industry awards.

In his first party-political election-campaign broadcast Brash mentioned a number of aspects of his life that he believed had attuned him to the political centre-ground in New Zealand:

*registering as a conscientious objector at age 18
*serving as the patron of Amnesty International Freedom Foundation
*participating in demonstrations against the racially selected South African rugby team touring New Zealand (1981) and the New Zealand All-Blacks rugby team touring South Africa without Māori team members
*his frugal approach, most famously washing his own laundry in his hotel-room basin while on taxpayer-funded overseas trips as Governor of the Reserve Bank
*voting for Labour in his early years

=== Campaign ===
On 19 August 2005, National unveiled a $3.9 billion tax-cut policy. The first polling conducted after the announcement suggested that it had boosted National support. On 22 August, Brash engaged in a televised debate with the Labour Party leader Helen Clark. According to &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, Clark appeared &#x27;confident and aggressive&#x27; and Brash appeared &#x27;defensive&#x27;. In response to questions over his assertiveness, Brash indicated that he had not attacked Clark during the debate because she was a woman. Clark described Brash&#x27;s explanation as patronising.

On 27 August a weekend newspaper published a series of leaked documents, including private emails, showing that members of the ACT party and of the Business Round Table had advised Brash during his bid for the leadership of the parliamentary National Party. Continuing leaks over following weeks appeared designed to cause the National leader embarrassment. Furthermore, confusion bedevilled National&#x27;s potential coalition options: New Zealand First showed reluctance to reveal whether it would support National or Labour post-election, whilst ACT (often seen as National&#x27;s natural coalition partner due to the similarities in some of their policies) criticised National for not openly supporting ACT leader Rodney Hide&#x27;s bid to win the electorate seat of Epsom.

Pamphlets distributed by members of a Christian sect, the Exclusive Brethren, in early September caused further embarrassment for Brash; although they were not anonymous, they did not refer to the Exclusive Brethren but were authorised in the names of individual church members. Brash initially denied National had anything to do with it, but later admitted that the Brethren had told him at a meeting some months earlier that they planned to run a campaign opposing the direction of the Labour Government. Brash has maintained his position that the pamphlet-campaign took place on the Exclusive Brethren&#x27;s own initiative.

The General Election on 17 September produced a close result, with initial election-night figures from rural areas favouring National (in accordance with tradition and previous patterns); but by the end of the evening Labour had won 40.7% of the vote to National&#x27;s 39.6%. Following the counting of the special votes the gap widened, with Labour taking 41.1% of the vote to National&#x27;s 39.1%. Brash conceded defeat on 1 October after weeks of electoral uncertainty while the major parties sought to secure the support of minor coalition partners. His only realistic scenario for becoming prime minister would have involved a coalition between National, ACT and United Future, with confidence and supply from New Zealand First and the Māori Party. This appeared highly unlikely on several counts. New Zealand First&#x27;s involvement in such a coalition would have run counter to its pre-election promise to deal with the biggest party. Brash&#x27;s promise to abolish Māori electorates alienated the Māori Party.

Essentially National had failed to make up enough ground in the cities but swept the electoral votes in the provinces, clawing back a number of seats from Labour and defeating New Zealand First founder-leader Winston Peters in his electorate (Peters remained in Parliament as a list MP). Apart from in Auckland, National&#x27;s support centred mainly in rural and provincial areas.

== 2006–2011 ==
Brash took leave on 13 September 2006, to sort out marital troubles. Rumours of an extramarital affair came to the public&#x27;s attention around this date after National MP Brian Connell allegedly confronted Brash in a caucus-meeting about the rumours. Details leaked to the press, and in the weeks that followed the National Party caucus suspended Connell from membership of the caucus.

On Saturday 23 September, Brash appeared on Television New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;Agenda&quot; news programme and acknowledged that he had met with Exclusive Brethren representatives after the 2005 general election.

Brash indicated his intention to remain the leader of the National Party and to contest the next election in that role. However, it became increasingly clear that the caucus preferred Finance Spokesman John Key, whose rating steadily rose in &quot;preferred Prime Minister&quot; polls. Key made no move publicly, but Brash&#x27;s reputation for honesty and political competence eroded when, for example, broadcast footage showed him walking a plank, and when allegations appeared of his having an affair with an Auckland businesswoman, Diane Foreman – a charge he has never denied. Despite these setbacks, when asked by an interviewer for an article published in the United Kingdom on 18 November 2006 if he planned to remain leader of his party, &quot;...the Clark Kent of Kiwi politics [Brash] turned to me and smiled gently. &#x27;That&#x27;s my intention,&#x27;...&quot;

=== Resignation ===
During a hastily called press-conference on Thursday 23 November 2006, Brash announced his resignation as the National Party leader, effective from 27 November. Speculation regarding his leadership had foreshadowed this move, and the publicity had had a negative effect on his political party. The publicity came to a head just before the scheduled publication of a book written by Nicky Hager containing leaked emails (amongst other allegedly damaging revelations).

On 16 November 2006 Brash had obtained a High Court injunction prohibiting the distribution or publication of the private emails allegedly unlawfully taken from his computer, following ongoing rumours that his opponents would publish a series of his personal emails as a book, and he confirmed that the police had commenced a criminal investigation into the alleged email-theft. However he claimed he had no awareness of and did not wish to stop the publication of the Hager book.
As part of his resignation announcement, Brash also announced he had cleared the way for the book&#x27;s release by providing lifting the injunction, and stated it had nothing to with his resignation.

Brash also claimed that the publication of the book did not contribute to his decision to resign as National Party leader. The book, &quot;The Hollow Men: A Study in the Politics of Deception&quot;, details Brash&#x27;s rise to power in the National Party as assisted by an &quot;informal network of people from the right of New Zealand politics&quot;, including a number of ACT members. It also documents that senior National Party figures, including Brash, knew of the Exclusive Brethren&#x27;s pamphlet campaigns in May 2005, although Brash denied knowledge of this until August.

On Thursday 30 November 2006, just one week after resigning as leader of the party, Brash resigned from Parliament after the National Party&#x27;s new parliamentary leader, John Key, declined to offer him a senior portfolio. He set no official date, but he stated he would not return in the new year.

Brash then made his valedictory speech on Tuesday 12 December 2006. On 7 February 2007, Katrina Shanks took his place as a National Party list MP.

=== Career after national politics ===
On 18 May 2007, Brash joined the ANZ National Bank board as Rob McLeod retired from the board to return to his accounting practice. He became chairman of Huljich Wealth Management, an independent, specialist funds-management company based in Auckland, New Zealand. In late 2008 he was lecturing in economics at the Auckland University of Technology In April 2009 Brash was appointed as a director of the electricity grid operator Transpower.

In late April 2011, Brash, still a National Party member, announced that he would like to lead the ACT Party, which would require incumbent leader Rodney Hide to step down. Hide dismissed any talk of a leadership challenge to him but Brash was quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;d like to say to the board that, under my leadership, I believe Act has a much better prospect of not only getting back into Parliament but having a significant number of MPs.&quot; John Key also would not rule out working with Brash if it came down to a tight decision.

Brash chairs the New Zealand subsidiary of the state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.

=== Leadership of the ACT Party ===
On 28 April 2011 the incumbent leader of the ACT Party, Rodney Hide, announced that he was stepping down as leader in favour of Brash who had joined the party that morning. His membership was ratified by the party board on Saturday 30 April and the ACT party parliamentary caucus confirmed him as leader the same day. The party board re-convened later that day to ratify his leadership. Rodney Hide remained in Parliament until its dissolution prior to the 2011 general election. Brash was leader of the party outside Parliament and former Auckland City mayor John Banks stood in Epsom. The &quot;Listener&quot; compared Brash&#x27;s successful bid for the leadership of the ACT Party to a hostile takeover. Brash hoped to get ACT 15% of the party vote in the 2011 election, but it only managed 1%. Brash resigned on election night and was later replaced as leader by John Banks.

Brash&#x27;s 213 day tenure as ACT leader remained the shortest tenure of any major party leader in modern New Zealand politics until 14 July 2020, when National Party Leader Todd Muller resigned from the position just 53 days after he was elected to the position.

== Hobson&#x27;s Pledge ==
In September 2016, Brash became the spokesperson for a new lobby group called Hobson&#x27;s Pledge. Hobson&#x27;s Pledge is named after William Hobson, the first Governor of New Zealand and co-author of the Treaty of Waitangi. The group was formed to oppose what Brash has described as Māori favouritism and advocates abolishing the Māori electorates.

== 2018 Massey University talk and free speech ==
On 7 August 2018, Massey University Vice-Chancellor Jan Thomas cancelled Brash&#x27;s talk scheduled for the next day at the university&#x27;s Palmerston North campus. She cited safety issues regarding Brash&#x27;s support for the alt-right Canadian activists Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux&#x27;s Auckland tour and his leadership of the Hobson&#x27;s Pledge advocacy group, which has advocated the abolition of the Māori wards. She said too she &quot;supported free speech on campus, but totally opposed hate speech&quot;.

Brash criticised her decision as a threat to free speech. The cancellation was criticised by various public figures including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Education Minister Chris Hipkins, Opposition Leader Simon Bridges, and Massey University Students&#x27; Association President Ben Schmidt, and ACT party leader David Seymour. In addition, several Māori Members of Parliament including Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson and Labour MP Willie Jackson defended Brash&#x27;s right to free speech while expressing disagreement with his views of Māori. Brash later received a second invitation and delivered a speech on the campus on 17 October 2018, where fewer than 100 students were reported to attend.

==COVID-19 pandemic==
During the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, Brash joined several businessmen and former politicians including former National MP Ross Meurant in establishing a company called Covax-NZR Limited to import Russia&#x27;s untested Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V) vaccine into New Zealand. By late August 2020, they had submitted paperwork through the Russian Embassy to establish supply and distribution arrangements to import the vaccine, however no further progress has been made since then.

== Political positions ==

Brash voted for the decriminalisation of both prostitution and euthanasia, voted against raising the drinking age back up to 20 and voted against Manukau banning street prostitution. Brash voted against the Civil Unions Bill because he backed a public mandate for any change to the law. He has also called for the decriminalisation of cannabis.

In March 2013, Brash joined the debate over the future of Auckland, saying land needed to be freed up for residential zoning so house prices would come down, at odds with Mayor Len Brown&#x27;s plan to stop urban sprawl and build the city upwards.

In mid July 2024, Brash joined former Prime Minister Helen Clark in criticising the Sixth National Government&#x27;s perceived pro-US shift in New Zealand foreign policy. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon had recently said that the Government would be more willing to disclose cases of Chinese espionage in New Zealand and participating in AUKUS Pillar 2.

In late September 2024, Brash through his legal counsel Stephen Franks sent legal letters against former National Party staffer and lobbyist Matthew Hooton and Martyn &quot;Bomber&quot; Bradbury, the host of &quot;The Working Group&quot; podcast. During a podcast in late September, Hooton had made remarks attacking Brash&#x27;s character and accusing him of promoting racism against Māori during his parliamentary career and as leader of Hobson&#x27;s Pledge. Referencing Brash&#x27;s 2004 Orewa speech, Hooton had said: &quot;He [Brash] is a fundamentally bad person. He&#x27;s divided this country for no apparent reason, despite being certainly intelligent enough to know the things that he says are not true.&quot; On 24 September, Bradbury issued a statement stating that Hooton sincerely apologised for his remarks about Brash&#x27;s view.

==Private life==
Since 2016, Brash&#x27;s partner has been Margaret Murray-Benge. As Margaret Murray, she was a councillor for Waimairi District (1977–1989), Christchurch City (1992–1998), Since 2004, she has been a councillor for Western Bay of Plenty District.

<doc id="351224" wikidata="Q176015" url="?curid=351224" title="Australian Council of Trade Unions">
<text>The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), originally the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, is the largest peak body representing workers in Australia. It is a national trade union centre of 46 affiliated unions and eight trades and labour councils. The ACTU is a member of the International Trade Union Confederation.

The President of the ACTU is Michele O&#x27;Neil, who was elected on 28 July 2018. The current Secretary is Sally McManus.

==Objectives==
The objectives of the ACTU, found in its constitution, are:
* the socialisation of industry,
* the organisation of wage and salary earners in the Australian workforce (within the trade union movement),
* the utilisation of Australian resources to maintain full employment, establish equitable living standards which increase in line with output, and create opportunities for the development of talent.

==Organisation==
The ACTU holds a biennial congress that is attended by approximately 800 delegates from affiliated organisations. Between congresses the ACTU is governed by an executive of 60 members: the president, the two vice-presidents, the secretary, the assistant secretaries, Trades and Labour Council representatives from each capital city and elected delegates from affiliated unions.

==Current campaigns==
The ACTU&#x27;s main current campaigns include the campaign to win paid pandemic leave for all workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the For the workers campaign to oppose Commonwealth Government proposals to change Australian workplace laws, and the promotion of a Working from Home Charter.

Following the 2007 Australian federal election, the ACTU&#x27;s primary focus was the campaign to restore workers rights under the banner of the Your Rights at Work campaign. In addition to this campaign the ACTU is also running a number of other campaigns, including workplace health and safety, working with other unions on the Your Rights at Telstra campaign and supporting the Rights on Site campaign.

The ACTU has also launched a service by which workers can join their applicable union directly through the ACTU. This self-titled &quot;one stop shop&quot; for union membership is Australian Unions.

In 2008, the ACTU launched a campaign to make paid maternity leave a new national employment standard.

In 2011, the ACTU launched a campaign to address the spread of casual, contract and other forms of insecure work in Australian workplaces. Part of this involved an inquiry into insecure work.

In 2023, the ACTU and other big unions including the Health Services Union, and the Australian Manufacturing Workers&#x27; Union began a campaign calling for a levy to be imposed on non-union workers after the union was able to raise wages through collective bargaining.

==History==
In Australia, agitation for One Big Union took place from 1911 from two different sectors: from the revolutionary Australian section of the IWW and from the pro-arbitration Australian Workers Union (AWU). At that time the AWU was the largest single Australian union. In 1918 after the collapse of the Australian IWW, a group of militant trade unions (which were opposed to the AWU) attempted to form One Big Union under the name Workers Industrial Union of Australia (WIUA). The hostility between the WIUA and the AWU prevented the formation of One Big Union in Australia. The ACTU was formed as the Australasian Council of Trade Unions in 1927 and was one of the earliest attempts by trade unions to apply the principles of One Big Union earlier explored by more radical syndicalist unions like the CNT or revolutionary industrial unions like the IWW. The ACTU has not achieved the ideals expressed for One Big Union: it remains a council organisation, but it does however represent the majority of Australian trade unions. At its formation in 1927 the ACTU was only seen as representing blue collar trades unions, and only managed to achieve the support of trades unions.

Attempts of Nationalist Stanley Bruce&#x27;s federal government in 1927 to dismantle the Australian Industrial Relations Commission impelled Australian trade unions to form a national council. The ACTU&#x27;s Australian trade union &quot;peak body&quot; precursors include state labour councils like the Victorian Trades Hall Council (originating in 1856 as the &#x27;Melbourne Trades Hall Committee&#x27;), the Labor Council of New South Wales (originally formed in 1870 as the &#x27;Sydney Trades and Labor Council&#x27;) and the Inter-Colonial Trade Union Congress (formed in 1879).

From 1948 peak bodies of white collar associations existed, and from 1969 peak bodies of government employees. The white collar bodies were: the Council of Professional and Commercial Employees Association (1948), which became the Council of White Collar Associations (1954), which amalgamated with the Salaried Employees Consultative Council of New South Wales (1954) to become the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations (ACSPA) in 1956. The government employee bodies were: the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations (1969) which became the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations (CAGEO) in 1975. The ACTU successfully integrated these bodies in 1981. After 1981 the ACTU was generally viewed by the Australian media and public as the organisation representing all workers&#x27; organisations.

The ACTU and Labour Councils have often united Australian working class opinion behind certain initiatives like the eight-hour day or compulsory arbitration. In the early 1980s this unifying impulse created the Prices and Incomes Accord. The ACTU retains a close relationship with the Australian Labor Party: former ACTU President Bob Hawke went on to become the leader of the ALP and then Prime Minister of Australia. Other former ACTU Presidents who went on to become members of Federal Parliament are: Simon Crean (president 1985–90), Martin Ferguson (1990–96), Jennie George (1996–99), and Ged Kearney (2010–18). The November 2007 election win by the Labor Party, saw the election of a number of union officials to the parliament (Commonwealth) including Bill Shorten (Australian Workers Union) and Greg Combet (former ACTU Secretary).

In the late 1980s and early 1990s the ACTU was influential in a move to forcibly amalgamate smaller unions into so called &quot;super unions&quot;. The ACTU&#x27;s plans envisaged 20 super unions organised on an industrial basis. While many amalgamations occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s (in part under the influence of changed industrial law), there are still many unions, and union coverage is often organised by historical amalgamation, not by industry.

== Past campaigns ==
In the lead up to the 2007 federal election, the ACTU campaigned actively against the Howard government&#x27;s WorkChoices legislation, which included an advertising campaign and public rallies. This campaign was originally called &quot;Your Rights at Work&quot; but is now known as &quot;Secure Jobs. Better Future&quot; and was considered a success in making industrial relations an important election issue by both marketing companies and even Joe Hockey MP, the Federal Workplace Relations Minister, who said &quot;This is the most sophisticated political plan that we have seen in Australia.&quot;. One of the rallies was called &quot;Fill the &quot;G&quot; &quot;, attended by 50,000 people at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and broadcast to other similar rallies throughout the country. A previous national rally had a reported attendance of 500,000 around Australia.

<doc id="351226" wikidata="Q11897194" url="?curid=351226" title="The Great Gildersleeve">
<text>The Great Gildersleeve was a radio situation comedy broadcast in the United States from August 31, 1941 to 1958. Initially written by Leonard Lewis Levinson, it was one of broadcast history&#x27;s earliest spin-off programs. The series was built around Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve, a regular character from the radio situation comedy &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;. The character was introduced in the October 3, 1939, episode (number 216) of that series. Actor Harold Peary had played a similarly named character, Dr. Gildersleeve, on earlier episodes. &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot; enjoyed its greatest popularity in the 1940s. Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spin-off and later in four feature films released at the height of the show&#x27;s popularity.

In &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;, Peary&#x27;s Gildersleeve had been a pompous windbag and antagonist of Fibber McGee. &quot;You&#x27;re a &quot;haa-aa-aa-aard&quot; man, McGee!&quot; became a Gildersleeve catchphrase. The character went by several aliases on &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;; his middle name was revealed to be &quot;Philharmonic&quot; on October 22, 1940, in episode #258, &quot;Fibber Discovers Gildersleeve&#x27;s Locked Diary&quot;.

&quot;Gildy&quot; grew so popular that Kraft Foods—promoting its Parkay margarine—sponsored a new series featuring Peary&#x27;s somewhat mellowed and always befuddled Gildersleeve as the head of his own family.

==Premiere==
&quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot; premiered on NBC on August 31, 1941. It moves the title character from the McGees&#x27; Wistful Vista to Summerfield, where Gildersleeve oversees his late sister and brother-in-law&#x27;s estate (said to have both been killed in a car accident) and rears his orphaned niece and nephew, Marjorie and Leroy Forrester. The household also includes a cook named Birdie. While Gildersleeve had occasionally mentioned his (silent) wife in some &quot;Fibber&quot; episodes, in his own series he is a confirmed bachelor.

At the outset of the series, Gildersleeve administers a girdle manufacturing company (&quot;If you want the best of corsets, of course it&#x27;s Gildersleeve&quot;); later and during the remainder of the show he serves as Summerfield&#x27;s water commissioner.

==Family==
A key figure in the Gildersleeve home was the cook and housekeeper Birdie Lee Coggins (Lillian Randolph). In the first season, under writer Levinson, Birdie was often portrayed as less than intelligent, but she slowly developed as the real brains and caretaker of the household under John Whedon and other writers.

Marjorie (originally played by Lurene Tuttle, later by Louise Erickson and Mary Lee Robb) matured to a young woman through the 1940s. During the ninth season (September 1949-June 1950) she met and married Walter &quot;Bronco&quot; Thompson (Richard Crenna), star football player at the local college. &quot;Look&quot; devoted five pages in its May 23, 1950, issue to the wedding. After living in the same household for a few years, the newlyweds moved next door.

Leroy (Walter Tetley), who remained age 10–11 during most of the 1940s, began to grow up in the spring of 1949, establishing relationships with the girls in the Bullard home across the street. He developed interests in driving, playing the drums and dreaming of a musical career.

==Neighbors and friends==
Outside the home, Gildersleeve&#x27;s closest association was with the executor of his brother-in-law&#x27;s estate, Judge Horace Hooker (Earle Ross), with whom he had many battles during the first few broadcast seasons. After a change in scriptwriters in January 1943, the confrontations slowly subsided and the two men became friends. During the second season, pharmacist Richard Q. Peavey (Richard LeGrand) and barber Floyd Munson (Mel Blanc for the first year, Arthur Q. Bryan from December 1942 onward) joined Gildersleeve&#x27;s circle of acquaintances.

In the fourth season, these three friends, along with Police Chief Donald Gates (Ken Christy), formed the nucleus of the Jolly Boys Club, whose activities revolve around practicing barbershop quartet songs between sips of Coca-Cola.

Several women passed through Gildersleeve&#x27;s life during the series, including three he almost married before settling into a pattern of casual dating. His friends included Shirley Mitchell (Leila Ranson), Una Merkel (Adaline Fairchild), Bea Benaderet (Eve Goodwin), Martha Scott (Ellen Bullard Knickerbocker), Jeanne Bates (Paula Bullard Winthrop) and Cathy Lewis (Katherine Milford). Another woman in Gildersleeve&#x27;s life was his inept, milkshake loving secretary Bessie played by Gloria Holiday who became Mrs. Harold Peary in real life.

== Decline and fall ==
In 1950, Harold Peary was persuaded to move &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot; to CBS, but sponsor Kraft refused to sanction the move. Peary, now contracted to CBS, was legally unable to appear on NBC as a star performer, but &quot;Gildersleeve&quot; was still an NBC series. This prompted the hiring of Willard Waterman as Peary&#x27;s replacement as Gildersleeve. Peary, meanwhile, began a new series on CBS which attempted to reproduce the Gildersleeve show with the names changed. &quot;The Harold Peary Show&quot;, lasting one season, included a fictitious radio show within the show. This was &quot;Honest Harold&quot;, hosted by Peary&#x27;s new character.

As with most radio sitcoms still on the air at the time, &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot; began a slow but massive reformat in the early 1950s. Starting in mid 1952, some of the program&#x27;s longtime characters (Judge Hooker, Floyd Munson, Marjorie and her husband, Bronco) were missing for months at a time. In their place were a few new ones (Mr. Cooley the Egg Man and Mrs. Potter the hypochondriac) who would last only a month or so. By 1953, Gildersleeve&#x27;s love life took center stage over his family and friends. His many love interests were constantly shifting, and women came and went with great frequency. In November 1954, after an extended summer hiatus, &quot;Gildersleeve&quot; was reformatted as a 15-minute daily sitcom. Only Gildersleeve, Leroy and Birdie remained on a continuing basis. All other characters were seldom heard, and gone were Marjorie and her family as well as the studio audience, live orchestra and original scripts. The series finally ended its run in 1958.

==Television==
As with most radio series, the show suffered from the advent of television. A televised version of the series, produced and syndicated by NBC, also starring Waterman, premiered in 1955, but lasted only 39 episodes. During that year, both the 15-minute radio show and the television show were being produced simultaneously.

On the television series, Gildersleeve was sketched as less lovable, more pompous and a more overt womanizer. Harold Peary stated that the problem with the television series was that &quot;Waterman was a very tall man&quot; and &quot;Gildersleeve was not a tall man, he was a little man, who thought he was a tall man, that was the character.&quot; He added, &quot;Willard [Waterman] did a very good job on the radio show&quot; but was &quot;miscast on the television version&quot;.

Actress Barbara Stuart landed her first television role on &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot; in the role of Gildersleeve&#x27;s secretary, Bessie. Child actor Michael Winkelman, later of &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, also made his first television appearance on the show in the role of 9-year-old Bruce Fuller. Actor Clegg Hoyt also made his television debut on the series as a carnival barker in &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot; (1955).

== Films ==
After joining Jim and Marian Jordan (as Fibber McGee and Molly) and fellow radio favorite Edgar Bergen in &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Laughing&quot; (1941) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (1942), Peary received top billing for a brief series of RKO films. &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot; (1942) also carried Randolph from the radio cast to the screen, with Nancy Gates as Marjorie and Freddie Mercer as Leroy. Walter Tetley, who played Leroy on radio, could not appear on screen as Leroy because he was actually an adult playing a child character.

&quot;Gildersleeve&#x27;s Bad Day&quot; (1943) revolved around the mishaps when he is called to jury duty. &quot;Gildersleeve on Broadway&quot; (1943) centered on Leroy as the odd boy out as everyone around him is falling in love. The fourth and final film in the series, &quot;Gildersleeve&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1944) had Gildersleeve&#x27;s ancestors, Randolph and Johnson, rise from the dead to help his campaign for police commissioner.

Warner Archives released a DVD collection of all of the Gildersleeve RKO movies in January 2013. This multi-film release includes a fifth film, &quot;Seven Days&#x27; Leave&quot;, a 1942 Lucille Ball/Victor Mature musical comedy in which Peary co-stars as the Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve character.

A 1960 version of Gildersleeve, still played by Peary, appears in the 1944 Warner Bros. film &quot;The Shining Future&quot;, a promotional film for war bonds.

== Legacy ==
The Gildersleeve character was parodied in the 1945 Bugs Bunny cartoon &quot;Hare Conditioned&quot;, in which the rabbit distracts a menacing department store manager by telling him that he sounds &quot;just like that guy on the radio, the Great Gildersneeze!&quot; The taxidermist responds with &quot;I &quot;do&quot;?!&quot; followed by Gildersleeve&#x27;s chuckle. The Gildersleeve voice in this cartoon was done by comedian Dave Barry. (Earlier, in &quot;A Coy Decoy&quot;, Daffy Duck used Gildersleeve&#x27;s &quot;you&#x27;re a ha-a-ard man!&quot; line in an attempt to divert a wolf that is chasing him.)

His voice was also imitated by actor Kent Rogers in Tex Avery&#x27;s 1943 cartoon short &quot;One Ham&#x27;s Family&quot;.

Elroy Jetson, the son on Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s 1962 animated series &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, is named after Leroy Forrester. Elroy is an anagram of Leroy.

==Recordings==
At the height of the show&#x27;s popularity, Harold Peary recorded three albums as Gildersleeve, reading popular children&#x27;s stories for Capitol Records in heavy-bookleted four-disc 78rpm record albums. &quot;Stories for Children, Told in His Own Way by the Great Gildersleeve&quot;, was released in 1945 and was Capitol&#x27;s first-ever such release for children. With orchestral accompaniment, it featured &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;, &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot; and &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;.

The second album, &quot;Children&#x27;s Stories as Told by the Great Gildersleeve&quot;, in 1946, featured &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; and &quot;The Brave Little Tailor&quot;, again with orchestral accompaniment. The third and final album in the series, reverting to the title of the first and released in 1947, included &quot;Snow-White and Rose-Red&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot;, once more with full orchestral accompaniment.

The music was by Robert Emmett Dolan. Capitol Records brought in &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&#x27;s&quot; chief writers at the time, Sam Moore and John Whedon, to adapt the stories to Gildersleeve&#x27;s style.

In 1950, Peary, as &quot;the Great Gildersleeve&quot;, narrated a single 78rpm recording for Capitol of Dr. Seuss&#x27; &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot; with full orchestration and sound effects.

== After Gildersleeve ==
Peary continued his career (often billed as Hal Peary) in films and television well into the 1970s; he was especially active as a voice actor for cartoons produced by Rankin-Bass and Hanna-Barbera, among others. He died of a heart attack in 1985. Waterman, who was a regular supporting character on radio&#x27;s &quot;The Halls of Ivy&quot; while doing his version of &quot;Gildersleeve&quot;, died a decade later.

== Comics ==
A &quot;Great Gildersleeve&quot; story appeared inside of a 1944 edition of Supersnipe comic book.

<text>As an ethic that spans science, engineering, business, and the humanities, transparency is operating in such a way that it is easy for others to see what actions are performed. Transparency implies openness, communication, and accountability.

Transparency is practiced in companies, organizations, administrations, and communities. For example, in a business relation, fees are clarified at the outset by a transparent agent, so there are no surprises later. This is opposed to keeping this information hidden which is &quot;non-transparent&quot;. A practical example of transparency is also when a cashier makes changes after a point of sale; they offer a transaction record of the items purchased (e.g., a receipt) as well as counting out the customer&#x27;s change.

In information security, transparency means keeping the arcane, underlying mechanisms hidden so as not to obstruct intended function—an almost opposite sense. It principally refers to security mechanisms that are intentionally undetectable or hidden from view. Examples include hiding utilities and tools which the user does not need to know in order to do their job, like keeping the remote re-authentication operations of Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol hidden from the user.

==Wages==
In Norway and in Sweden, tax authorities annually release the &quot;skatteliste&quot;, &quot;taxeringskalendern&quot;, or &quot;tax list&quot;; official records showing the annual income and overall wealth of nearly every taxpayer.

Regulations in Hong Kong require banks to list their top earners – without naming them – by pay band.

In 2009, the Spanish government for the first time released information on the net worth of each cabinet member, but data on ordinary citizens is private. Currently, elected officials have to disclose their net worth on a yearly basis.

An unwritten norm requires that American politicians release their tax returns, in particular those running for the office of president. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump refused to release them, breaking a 47-year-old custom, but still got elected.

==Management==

Radical transparency is a management method where nearly all decision making is carried out publicly. All draft documents, all arguments for and against a proposal, all final decisions, and the decision making process itself are made public and remain publicly archived. This approach has grown in popularity with the rise of the Internet. Two examples of organizations utilizing this style are the Linux community and Indymedia.

Corporate transparency, a form of radical transparency, is the concept of removing all barriers to—and the facilitating of—free and easy public access to corporate information and the laws, rules, social connivance and processes that facilitate and protect those individuals and corporations that freely join, develop, and improve the process.

In 2025 the Austrian Court of Audit argued that mistakes had been made in granting neither Austria&#x27;s ministery of energy nor regulatory E-Control full access to gas contracts agreed upon between OMV and Russian Gazprom in 2006.

===Non-governmental organizations===
Accountability and transparency are of high relevance for non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In view of their responsibilities to stakeholders, including donors, sponsors, programme beneficiaries, staff, states and the public, they are considered to be of even greater importance to them than to commercial undertakings. Yet these same values are often found to be lacking in NGOs.

The &quot;International NGO Accountability Charter&quot;, linked to the Global Reporting Initiative, documents the commitment of its members international NGOs to accountability and transparency, requiring them to submit an annual report, among others. Signed in 2006 by 11 NGOs active in the area of humanitarian rights, the INGO Accountability Charter has been referred to as the &quot;first global accountability charter for the non-profit sector&quot;. In 1997, the One World Trust created an &quot;NGO Charter&quot;, a code of conduct comprising commitment to accountability and transparency.

==Media==

Media transparency is the concept of determining how and why information is conveyed through various means.

If the media and the public knows everything that happens in all authorities and county administrations there will be a lot of questions, protests and suggestions coming from media and the public. People who are interested in a certain issue will try to influence the decisions. Transparency creates an everyday participation in the political processes by media and the public. One tool used to increase everyday participation in political processes is freedom of information legislation and requests. Modern democracy builds on such participation of the people and media.

There are, for anybody who is interested, many ways to influence the decisions at all levels in society.

==Politics==
The right and the means to examine the process of decision making is known as transparency.
In politics, transparency is used as a means of holding public officials accountable and fighting corruption. When a government&#x27;s meetings are open to the press and the public, its budgets may be reviewed by anyone, and its laws and decisions are open to discussion, it is seen as transparent. It is not clear however if this provides less opportunity for the authorities to abuse the system for their own interests.

When military authorities classify their plans as secret, transparency is absent. This can be seen as either positive or negative; positive because it can increase national security, negative because it can lead to corruption and, in extreme cases, a military dictatorship.

While a liberal democracy can be a plutocracy, where decisions are made behind locked doors and the people have fewer possibilities to influence politics between the elections, a participative democracy is more closely connected to the will of the people. Participative democracy, built on transparency and everyday participation, has been used officially in northern Europe for decades. In the northern European country Sweden, public access to government documents became a law as early as 1766. It has officially been adopted as an ideal to strive for by the rest of EU, leading to measures like freedom of information laws and laws for lobby transparency.

To promote transparency in politics, Hans Peter Martin, Paul van Buitenen (Europa Transparant) and Ashley Mote decided to cooperate under the name Platform for Transparency (PfT) in 2005. Similar organizations that promotes transparency are Transparency International and the Sunlight Foundation.

A recent political movement to emerge in conjunction with the demands for transparency is the Pirate Party, a label for a number of political parties across different countries who advocate freedom of information, direct democracy, network neutrality, and the free sharing of knowledge.

==Online culture==

21st century culture affords a higher level of public transparency than ever before, and actually requires it in many cases. Modern technology and associated culture shifts have changed how government works (see WikiLeaks), what information people can find out about each other, and the ability of politicians to stay in office if they are involved in sex scandals. Due to the digital revolution, people no longer have a high level of control over what is public information, leading to a tension between the values of transparency and privacy.

==Research==

Scholarly research in any academic discipline may also be labeled as (partly) transparent (or open research) if some or all relevant aspects of the research are open in the sense of open source, open access and open data, thereby facilitating social recognition and accountability of the scholars who did the research and replication by others interested in the matters addressed by it.

Some mathematicians and scientists are critical of using closed source mathematical software such as Mathematica for mathematical proofs, because these do not provide transparency, and thus are not verifiable. Open-source software such as SageMath aims to solve this problem.

==Technology==

In the computer software world, open source software concerns the creation of software, to which access to the underlying source code is freely available. This permits use, study, and modification without restriction.

In computer security, the debate is ongoing as to the relative merits of the full disclosure of security vulnerabilities, versus a security-by-obscurity approach.

There is a different (perhaps almost opposite) sense of transparency in human-computer interaction, whereby a system after change adheres to its previous external interface as much as possible while changing its internal behaviour. That is, a change in a system is transparent to its users if the change is unnoticeable to them.

==Sports==

Sports has become a global business over the last century, and here, too, initiatives ranging from mandatory drug testing to the fighting of sports-related corruption are gaining ground based on the transparent activities in other domains.

==Criticism==

Sigmund Freud, following Friedrich Nietzsche (&quot;On Truth and Lie in a Nonmoral Sense&quot;), regularly argues that transparency is impossible because of the occluding function of the unconscious.

Among philosophical and literary works that have examined the idea of transparency are Michel Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; or David Brin&#x27;s &quot;The Transparent Society&quot;. The German philosopher and media theorist Byung-Chul Han, in his 2012 work &quot;Transparenzgesellschaft&quot;, sees transparency as a cultural norm created by neoliberal market forces, which he understands as the insatiable drive toward voluntary disclosure bordering on the pornographic. According to Han, the dictates of transparency enforce a totalitarian system of openness at the expense of other social values such as shame, secrecy, and trust. He was criticized for his concepts, as they would suggest corrupt politics, and for referring to the anti-democratic Carl Schmitt.

Anthropologists have long explored ethnographically the relation between revealed and concealed knowledges, and have increasingly taken up the topic in relation to accountability, transparency and conspiracy theories and practices today. Todd Sanders and Harry West, for example, suggest not only that realms of the revealed and concealed require each other, but also that transparency in practice produces the very opacities it claims to obviate.

Clare Birchall, Christina Gaarsten, Mikkel Flyverbom, Emmanuel Alloa and Mark Fenster, among others, write in the vein of &quot;critical transparency studies&quot;, which attempts to challenge particular orthodoxies concerning transparency. In an article, Birchall assessed &quot;whether the ascendance of transparency as an ideal limits political thinking, particularly for western socialists and radicals struggling to seize opportunities for change&quot;. She argues that the promotion of &quot;datapreneurial&quot; activity through open data initiatives outsources and interrupts the political contract between governed and government. She is concerned that the dominant model of governmental data-driven transparency produces neoliberal subjectivities that reduce the possibility of politics as an arena of dissent between real alternatives. She suggests that the radical left might want to work with and reinvent secrecy as an alternative to neoliberal transparency.

Researchers at the University of Oxford and Warwick Business School found that transparency can also have significant unintended consequences in the field of medical care. Gerry McGivern and Michael D Fischer found &quot;media spectacles&quot; and transparent regulation combined to create &quot;spectacular transparency&quot; which has some perverse effects on doctors&#x27; practice and increased defensive behaviour in doctors and their staff. Similarly, in a four-year organizational study, Fischer and Ferlie found that transparency in the context of a clinical risk management can act perversely to undermine ethical behavior, leading to organizational crisis and even collapse.

<doc id="351234" wikidata="Q217831" url="?curid=351234" title="Greenock">
<text>Greenock (; ; , ) is a town in Inverclyde, Scotland, located in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. The town is the administrative centre of Inverclyde Council. It is a former burgh within the historic county of Renfrewshire, and forms part of a contiguous urban area with Gourock to the west and Port Glasgow to the east.

The 2011 UK Census showed that Greenock had a population of 44,248, a decrease from the 46,861 recorded in the 2001 UK Census. It lies on the south bank of the Clyde at the &quot;Tail of the Bank&quot; where the River Clyde deepens into the Firth of Clyde.

== History ==
=== Name ===
Place-name scholar William J. Watson wrote that &quot;Greenock is well known in Gaelic as , dative of , &#x27;a sunny knoll. The Scottish Gaelic place-name is relatively common, with another Greenock near Callander in Menteith (formerly in Perthshire) and yet another at Muirkirk in Kyle, now in East Ayrshire. R. M. Smith in (1921) described the alternative derivation from Common Brittonic *, &#x27;gravelly or sandy place&#x27;, as more appropriate, accurately describing the original foreshore. Johnston (1934) notes that &quot;some Gaels call the seaport , and that a possible derivation may be , meaning &#x27;rough, gravelly&#x27;.

The name of the town has had various spellings over time. It was printed in early Acts of Parliament as &quot;Grinok&quot;, &quot;Greenhok&quot;, &quot;Grinock&quot;, &quot;Greenhoke&quot;, &quot;Greinnock&quot;, and later as &quot;Greinok&quot;. Old Presbyterial records used &quot;Grenok&quot;, a common spelling until it was changed to Greenock around 1700. &quot;Grenock&quot; was also used in the 19th century, e.g. in &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; publications.

The spelling &quot;Greenoak&quot; was found in two factory accounts dating back to 1717, and a legend developed of a green oak tree at the edge of the Clyde at William Street being used by fishermen to tie up their boats. No reliable source has been found referencing green oaks, however, and so this has been generally dismissed as imaginative Anglophone folk etymology. Nonetheless the image has frequently been used as an emblem or logo, carved on public buildings, used on banners and badges, and was once emblazoned on the local Co-operative Society emblem. It reappeared in 1992 as the new shopping centre&#x27;s name, the Oak Mall, which uses a green tree as its logo. The name is also recalled in a local song (&quot;The Green Oak Tree&quot;). Significantly, no green oak appears on the former burgh coat of arms, which features the three chalices of the Shaw Stewarts, a sailing ship in full sail, and two herring above the motto &quot;God Speed Greenock&quot;.

=== Early history ===

Hugh de Grenock was created a Scottish Baron in 1296, and the seat of the feudal barony of Greenock was apparently what became Easter Greenock Castle. Around 1400 his successor Malcolm Galbraith died with no sons, and his estate was divided between his two daughters to become two baronies: the eldest inherited Easter Greenock and married a Crawfurd, while Wester Greenock went to the younger daughter who married Schaw of Sauchie. Around 1540 the adjoining barony of Finnart was passed to the Schaw family, extending their holdings westward to the boundary of Gourock, and in 1542 Sir John Schaw founded Wester Greenock castle.

The Scottish Reformation of 1560 closed the chapels in the parish, and as the parish church was some distant at Inverkip over a difficult route which was impassable in winter, in 1589 John Schaw obtained a charter from King James VI to build a kirk for the &quot;poor people upon his lands who were all fishers and of a reasonable number&quot;. Later known as the Old Kirk or the Old West Kirk, it was constructed on the west bank of the West Burn estuary and is reputed to have been the first Protestant church built in Scotland after the Reformation.

The Schaw, later Shaw and Shaw-Stewart, family retained a leading role in Greenock over the following centuries. In 1670, Sir John Shaw obtained a charter from King Charles II, combining the lands of Finnart and the barony of Wester Greenock, to create the barony of Greenock.

=== Fishing villages, harbours and shipbuilding ===
The coast of Greenock formed a broad bay with three smaller indentations: the Bay of Quick was known as a safe anchorage as far back as 1164. To its east, a sandy bay ran eastwards from the Old Kirk and the West Burn as far as Wester Greenock castle. The fishing village of Greenock developed along this bay, and around 1635 Sir John Schaw had a jetty built into the bay which became known as Sir John&#x27;s Bay. In that year he obtained a Charter raising Greenock to a Burgh of Barony with rights to a weekly market. Further east, Saint Laurence Bay curved round past the Crawfurd Barony of Easter Greenock to Garvel (or Gravel) Point. When a pier (or dyke) was built making the bay an important harbour, the fishing village of Cartsdyke gained the alternative name of Craufurdsdyke. In 1642 it was made into the Burgh of Barony of Crawfurdsdyke, and part of the ill-fated Darien Scheme set out from this pier in 1697. Its town was named Cartsburn.

The fishing trade grew prosperous, with barrels of salted herring exported widely, and shipping trade developed. As seagoing ships could not go further up the River Clyde, the Glasgow merchants including the Tobacco Lords wanted harbour access but were in disputes with Greenock over harbour dues and warehouses. They tried to buy the Garvel estate for a harbour when Easter Greenock lands were put up for sale to meet debts, but were outbid by Sir John Schaw who then got a Crown Charter of 1670 uniting Easter and Wester Greenock into the Burgh Barony of Greenock. A separate Barony of Cartsburn was created, the first baron being Thomas Craufurd. In 1668 the City of Glasgow got the lease of of land upriver close to Newark Castle, and construction promptly started on Newport Glasgow harbour which by 1710 had the principal Clyde custom house.

In 1696 and 1700 Schaw and residents of the town made unsuccessful bids to the Scottish Parliament for grants for a Greenock harbour, then when the Act of Union 1707 opened up involvement in colonial trade, they raised their own funds. The work was completed in 1710, with quays extended out into Sir John&#x27;s Bay to enclose the harbour. In 1711 the shipbuilding industry was founded when Scotts leased ground between the harbour and the West Burn to build fishing boats. Greenock rapidly became a major port and shipbuilding centre, and though tobacco imported from the colonies was taken to Glasgow by pack horse, the more bulky imports of sugar were processed locally. From 1774 the dredging of the River Clyde increasingly allowed ships to take merchandise directly to Glasgow, but merchants continued to use Greenock harbour.

The American Revolutionary War temporarily interrupted trade, and the gun battery of Fort Beauclerc near the West Burn was extended to guard against the threat of privateers, but the emphasis shifted to wider markets including imports of rum and sugar from the Caribbean, wines from Spain, and fish from North America. A whaling business operated for about 40 years. Greenock &quot;was mainly a trading port for goods such as sugar and cotton, but also dispatched ships to West Africa to take people to be enslaved&quot; in Britain&#x27;s American colonies. In 1868, in what became a &quot;cause celebre&quot;, seven young Greenock males stowed away on a cargo ship bound for Quebec. Treated with what was, even for the times, exceptional brutality, they were forcibly disembarked in Newfoundland; by the time they were returned to Scotland, three of them had died. The Captain and mate of the cargo ship were tried in a blaze of publicity at the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh and served short prison terms.

=== Custom House and steamboats ===

In 1714 Greenock became a custom house port as a branch of Port Glasgow, and for a period this operated from rooms leased in Greenock. Receipts rose rapidly with the expansion of colonial trade, and in 1778 the custom house moved to newly-built premises at the West Quay of the harbour.

By 1791 a new pier was constructed at the East Quay. In 1812 Europe&#x27;s first steamboat service was introduced by with frequent sailings between Glasgow, Greenock and Helensburgh, and as trade built up the pier became known as Steamboat Quay.

The custom house needed larger premises and in May 1817 the foundation stone was laid at Steamboat Quay for a Custom House building designed by William Burn, which was completed in 1818. Its gracious neoclassical architecture features a Grecian Doric portico looking out over the quay, which would eventually be renamed Custom House Quay. In 1828 the Custom House was praised as &quot;a grand National Structure&quot; in &quot;the highest style of elegance&quot;. By then there were scheduled steamboat sailings to Belfast, Derry, Liverpool, Inverness, Campbeltown, the Hebrides and &quot;all the principal places in the Highlands&quot;.

The Custom House underwent extensive refurbishment which was completed in 1989 and, until closure of the building in 2010, housed a customs and excise museum which was open to the public. In June 2008 HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) announced that the building would close in 2011 as part of a rationalisation project with any jobs being transferred to offices in Glasgow, and despite a campaign to oppose these plans, the building closed in August 2010.

Riverside Inverclyde arranged further refurbishment works, and in 2013 announced that space had already been let to companies including PG Paper Company Ltd and Toshiba which had planning permission to form meeting rooms and an executive office in the building. Greenock Telegraph estimated that £4.1 million has been spent over five-year period for the renovation works.

=== Industry and railways ===

Greenock became a centre of industry, with water power being used to process imported goods. In 1827 Loch Thom was constructed as a reservoir with &quot;The Cut&quot; aqueduct, bringing water to two lines of falls for water mills to power a paper mill, cotton and woollen mills, sugar refineries and shipbuilding

Greenock Central railway station at Cathcart Street opened in 1841, for the first time providing a fast route from Glasgow to the coast linking up with Clyde steamer services. The provision of this new line meant there was no need to take the steamer all the way down river from Glasgow. In 1869 the Caledonian Railway was bypassed by the rival Greenock and Ayrshire Railway which opened a station on the waterfront at its Albert Harbour station (later renamed Princes Pier), served by a tunnel under Greenock&#x27;s west end. To regain custom, the Caledonian Railway extended (what is now known as the Inverclyde Line) the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway west to Gourock; this line was built to run inland through deep cuttings and tunnels, with a tunnel under the whole length of Newton Street crossing under the other railway tunnel to emerge near Fort Matilda railway station. Spoil from the cuttings and tunnels was used to build an embankment out from the shore to a long timber wharf at Gourock railway station, providing space for railway sidings. The railway bought Wester Greenock castle and its extension, the Mansion House, and demolished them before constructing the tunnel immediately west of Greenock Central station, running under the castle grounds which now form Well Park.

Greenock&#x27;s increasing importance and wealth was manifested in the construction of the Greenock Municipal Buildings, whose Victoria Tower, completed in 1886, stands tall. The War of 1812 reawakened fears of American raids against Britain&#x27;s ports. Earlier gun batteries had been dismantled and in 1813 ground was granted for a battery at Whitefarland Point. Fort Matilda was completed in 1818 and was sporadically modified over the century. The land to the west of this was common ground for inhabitants of the town, but in 1907 the Admiralty compulsorily purchased part of this land for a torpedo factory. The remaining space was handed over to Greenock Corporation in 1914 as a public park.

The &quot;Clyde Torpedo Factory&quot; opened in 1910, with 700 workers transferred from the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. The site was tasked with designing and testing of torpedoes, the testing taking place in Loch Long. During the Second World War the site switched entirely to manufacturing torpedoes. The original gun battery site was occupied by the &quot;Navy Buildings&quot;, the main offices, just to the east of the torpedo factory buildings.
Following WW2, in 1947, the site became fully committed to R&amp;D as the Torpedo Experimental Establishment (TEE). TEE was closed in 1959, when all torpedo research, development and design were concentrated at the newly formed Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment (AUWE), Portland.

A church which became known as the Old West Kirk had been established in Greenock in 1591 under the patronage of John Schaw, the first built in Scotland since the Reformation. It was extended over the years, at an early stage the Schaw aisle provided pews for the Laird of the Barony, built as a gallery to the east of the nave of the church. Opposite it, above the front entrance, is the Crawfurdsburn or Choir Gallery. At the south end of the nave, the Sailor&#x27;s Loft gallery was built in 1698 and features a 19th-century model frigate, which replaced earlier models. At the north end, the Farmer&#x27;s Gallery is above the main seating area. A tower was added in the mid 19th century.

In 1926, to make way for expansion of the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard (the present-day location of Container Way), the Old West Kirk was relocated to a new site on the Esplanade where it still stands. The shipbuilders provided the Pirrie Hall to the south of the site: this was opened in February 1925, just after the old church closed for work to commence, and was used during the works to accommodate services, enabling the congregation to see progress on the rebuilt kirk. It then came into use as the church hall.

The church is notable for stained glass by artists such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Sir Edward Burne-Jones. The Church has a website.

=== Second World War ===


Greenock suffered badly during the Second World War and its anchorage at the Tail of the Bank became the base for the Home Fleet as well as the main assembly point for Atlantic convoys. On 30 April 1940 the French Vauquelin class destroyer &quot;Maillé Brézé&quot; blew up off Greenock with heavy loss of life following an accident involving two of her own torpedoes. Although this disaster occurred before the Free French Naval Forces were established, many people tend to regard the Cross of Lorraine on Lyle Hill as a memorial to the loss of the &quot;Maillé Brézé&quot; as well as to the later losses of the Free French Naval Forces which sailed from the town. On the nights of 6 May and 7 May 1941 around 300 Luftwaffe aircraft attacked the town in the Greenock Blitz.

On 10 October 1940, RAF Greenock was created as a maintenance base for RAF flying boats. The base was hit on 7 May 1941 during the Greenock Blitz.

A large building housing a drapery business constructed on Cowan&#x27;s property at the corner of the Municipal Buildings was badly damaged and was demolished, leaving the blank brick corner area still known as &quot;Cowan&#x27;s Corner&quot;. This was later landscaped and used as a garden. The neighbouring Municipal Buildings was also severely damaged during the bombings, which soon led to the loss of a Southern Tower, and two pediments situated on top of the South Façade of the buildings.

=== Post–war years ===

Greenock thrived in the post-war years but as the heavy industries declined in the 1970s and 1980s unemployment became a major problem, and it has only been in the last ten years with reinvestment and the redevelopment of large sections of the town that the local economy has started to revive. Tourism has appeared as an unexpected bonus with the development of the Clydeport container port as Ocean Terminal, a passenger terminal for cruise ships touring the Atlantic. Students who do not travel further afield for study often attend the Greenock campus of West College (formerly known as James Watt College of Further and Higher Education).

Greenock reached its population peak in 1921 (81,123) and was once the sixth largest town in Scotland.

== Governance ==

Until 1974, Greenock was a parliamentary burgh in its own right. It was merged with Port Glasgow to form Greenock and Port Glasgow constituency. In 1997, it became Greenock and Inverclyde. After the redistribution of Scottish seats, it was merged into an enlarged &quot;Inverclyde&quot; constituency – the first time in political history that Greenock has not been named in a parliamentary seat. &quot;Greenock and Inverclyde&quot; remains a Scottish Parliament constituency.

Greenock is the administrative centre of Inverclyde Council, the local authority responsible for the wider Inverclyde area in which Greenock is located. The council is based in the Greenock Municipal Buildings.

== Climate ==

Greenock&#x27;s climate is temperate maritime having mainly cool summers and mild winters. The coastal location means that the heat capacity of seawater helps keep winter temperatures higher than locations just a few miles inland.

Although there has been recent debate the moderating influence of the North Atlantic Drift, a warm oceanic current that is the eastern extension of the Gulf Stream, means that Greenock&#x27;s average temperature is approximately one degree Celsius greater than eastern Scottish coastal towns on the same latitude (55.94 degrees north); whilst in winter, Greenock is considerably warmer than continental locations at the same latitude, such as Moscow.

Anecdotally Greenock has a reputation for receiving higher than average rainfall (the song &quot;The Green Oak Tree&quot; comments on this). Whilst the rainfall is indeed higher than the average recorded at Scottish weather stations, the greatest rainfall in Scotland occurs on the west (ocean) facing mountain slopes of Lochaber, near Fort William in the Highlands.

Greenock&#x27;s latitude means long hours of daylight in midsummer with the opposite true in midwinter. On the summer solstice, usually observed on the 21 June, the sun rises at 04:31 and sets at 22:07. On the winter solstice, usually 21 December, the sun rises at 08:46 and sets at 15:44.

==Education==
 

The Highlanders academy was built in 1837, partly by subscription, and partly by grant from government, on a site given by the late Sir Michael Shaw Stewart.

Greenock has the following primary schools as of 2023: 
* Ardgowan Primary School, on Newton Street
* Lady Alice Primary School, on Gateside Avenue
* St Josephs R C Primary School, on Wren Road
* St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, on Patrick Street
* St Patricks Primary School, on Cornhaddock Street
* Whinhill Primary School, on Peat Road
* Aileymill Primary School, on Norfolk Road
* St Andrew&#x27;s Primary School, on Chester Road
* All Saints Primary School, on Blairmore Road
* King&#x27;s Oak Primary School, on East Crawford Street

Greenock has the following high schools as of 2023:
* Notre Dame High School, on Dunlop Street
* Inverclyde Academy, on Cumberland Road
* Clydeview Academy, on Burnside Road

Greenock has another educational establishment:
* Lomond View Academy 
Greenock used to have a private school, the Cedars School of Excellence. However, it closed down in September 2024 after 25 years of running, due to rising costs.

== Health ==
The Greenock Infirmary, later the Royal Infirmary, was established in 1809, when a building was erected at an expense of £1815, on a site of land given by Sir John Shaw Stewart. Today, the town is served by the Inverclyde Royal Hospital which is located in Greenock serving the population of Inverclyde, Largs, the Isle of Bute and the Cowal Peninsula. The hospital was commissioned to replace the Greenock Royal Infirmary, the Eye Infirmary, Gateside Hospital, Duncan Macpherson Hospital and Broadstone Jubilee Hospital. Construction work started at the end of August 1970 and the hospital was completed in 1979.

In 2004 Inverclyde Royal Hospital faced proposals for a major downsizing with the loss of the accident and emergency department and the acute surgical ward in an effort to save costs. Many people criticised the plans complaining that the Inverclyde Royal Hospital was being seen as nothing more than a large health centre. In February 2007, after undertaking a review, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde proposed retaining the accident and emergency department and core inpatient services, including the trauma and emergency medical departments at Inverclyde Royal Hospital and submitted this proposal to the Scottish Government for approval.

Langhill Clinic situated behind Inverclyde Royal Hospital is now the main psychiatric hospital with an IPCU unit and Day hospital alongside the main psychiatric ward.

== Economy ==

===Economic history===

Historically, the town relied on shipbuilding, sugar refining and wool manufacturing for employment, but none of these industries are today part of Greenock&#x27;s economy. More recently the town relied heavily on electronics manufacture. However, this has given way mostly to: call centre business, insurance, banking and shipping export.

The Fleming and Reid merino wool mill employed 500 people – mostly women and produced wool garments spun and woven at the mill. This mill was at the corner of Drumfrochar Road and Mill Road.

As of October 2012 Greenock has an unemployment rate of 5.3%, above the Scottish average of 3.9% (figure is for the Scottish Parliament constituency and includes Gourock, Inverkip, Port Glasgow and Wemyss Bay).

=== Shipbuilding ===

In the early 17th century, the first pier was built in Greenock. Shipbuilding was already an important employer by this time. The first proper harbour was constructed in 1710 and the first well-known shipbuilders, Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, was established the following year. It gained numerous contracts with the Royal Navy from 1806, building ships such as .

In 1967 Scott&#x27;s was merged with Lithgows (founded 1874, later the largest privately owned yard in the world) the same year becoming Scott Lithgow, which was later nationalised as part of British Shipbuilders in 1977. From 1800 to 1980 many thousands of people worked to design, build and repair ships. The reduction in shipbuilding in the 1970s and 1980s meant that none of these companies are still trading.

Greenock Shipbuilders included: Scotts, Browns, William Lithgows, Fergusons, Head the Boat Builder (lifeboats). Other marine engineering related companies included engine-makers – Kincaids, Scotts, Rankin and Blackmore (which included the Eagle Foundry) – ship repair (Lamonts) and Hasties for steering gear. Yacht builders included Adams and McLean (at Cardwell Bay). Other yards included Cartsburn, Cartsdyke, and Klondyke – all of which closed during the 1970s and 1980s due to competition from South Korea and Japan.

Part of the site of the &quot;Scott&#x27;s&quot; yard, is now an EE call centre, and the Kingston Yard was redeveloped for housing. Shipbuilding is now continued at Ferguson Marine Engineering in nearby Port Glasgow, after Ferguson Shipbuilders was taken over by Jim McColl and began modernisation.
Ship repair work continues at the Garvel Drydock in Greenock&#x27;s Great Harbour.

The Inchgreen Drydock was opened in 1964 as one of the largest in the world at 305 m long and 48 m wide. It was used to re-fit the , and to fit-out the &quot;QE2&quot;. In 1966 it came under the nationalised Clydeport, which was privatised in 1982 and in 2003 was sold to Peel Ports of The Peel Group. They subsequently operated the drydock as part of their Cammell Laird shipbuilding subsidiary. Peel Ports put the drydock on the market for a lease in 2014, and Jim McColl opened discussions on leasing the dock to expand Fergusons&#x27; shipbuilding, but nothing came of the negotiations. On 1 May 2017, Clydeport stated that the drydock cranes are to be demolished. In November 2021 it was announced that the dock had been leased to Atlas Decommissioning as a site for breaking up marine vessels.

=== Shipping ===
 

Freight traffic is handled at the container cranes of Greenock&#x27;s &quot;Ocean Terminal&quot;, at &quot;Prince&#x27;s Pier&quot; which was constructed for the Glasgow and South Western Railway. The same terminal is a regular port of call for cruise liners visiting the west of Scotland.

Greenock was a regular port of call for Cunard Line and Canadian Pacific in the 1950s and 1960s. Ships on the Montreal to Liverpool transit would anchor at the Tail of the Bank off Greenock in the Firth of Clyde and steam paddlewheel ferries would service the liners. Cunard operated: the RMS Ivernia (1954), RMS Saxonia (1955), RMS Carinthia (1956) and RMS Sylvania (1957). These four ships were built at John Brown &amp; Company shipyards, typically 22,000 tons, twin screw, 600 passengers. CP operated the Empress of Britain (1956), Empress of Canada and Empress of England.

Greenock&#x27;s Great Harbour is one of the three main ports providing marine services support to the Royal Navy, in dual site operation with Faslane at HMNB Clyde on the Gare Loch. 240 staff of the former Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service were transferred to Serco Denholm under a 15-year £1bn PFI contract awarded in December 2007. This facility means that &quot;Admiralty&quot; boats and tugs are a common sight on the Clyde.

Greenock&#x27;s attractive esplanade provides a gently curving riverside walk just over a mile (1.6 km) long extending to the west from &quot;Ocean Terminal&quot; to the &quot;Royal West of Scotland Amateur Boat Club&quot; sailing, kayaking and rowing facilities, which originated as a rowing club built against the east wall of Fort Matilda in 1866, and was granted its present title in 1885. The present clubhouse dates from 1878, and was subsequently extended.

Fort Matilda was adapted for various purposes, eventually becoming the &quot;Navy Buildings&quot; which housed a main Her Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard centre until it closed in December 2012, as well as a Royal Naval Reserve establishment, . The buildings have now been demolished, as a site for blocks of flats off Eldon Street.

=== Sugar ===

Sugar refining began in Greenock in 1765. John Walker began a sugar refinery in Greenock in 1850 followed by the prominent local cooper and shipowner Abram Lyle who, with four partners, purchased the &quot;Glebe Sugar Refinery&quot; in 1865. Another 12 refineries were active at one point. The most successful of these was Tate &amp; Lyle. It was formed from a merger in 1921 between Abram Lyle, who had expanded into Plaistow, and Henry Tate, who had set up a sugar refinery in Liverpool and had expanded into London.

The James Watt Dock, opened in 1886, provided shipping and shipbuilding facilities including a large warehouse (known as the Sugar Shed) which was used for both imported raw sugar, and refined sugar ready for delivery. By the end of the 19th century, around 400 ships a year were transporting sugar from Caribbean holdings to Greenock for processing. There were 14 sugar refineries, including The Westburn, Walkers, The Glebe, Lochore and Ferguson and Dempster, plus a sugar beet factory on Ingleston Street. Tobacco from the Americas also arrived here.

When Tate and Lyle finally closed its Greenock refinery in 1997 it brought to an end the town&#x27;s 150-year-old connections with sugar manufacture. A newly built sugar warehouse continued shipping operations at Greenock&#x27;s &quot;Ocean Terminal&quot;. The former sugar warehouse at the James Watt Dock was by then scheduled as a category A listed building as a fine example of early industrial architecture, with an unusual feature of a colonnade of cast iron columns forming a sheltered unloading area next to the quayside. This building has since lain empty, with various schemes being proposed for conversion and restoration. The photographs show the building still intact in February 2006, but a fire on the evening of 12 June 2006 caused severe damage to much of the building before being brought under control in the early hours of 13 June. The local council confirmed that parts of the building will have to be taken down to ensure public safety, but promised an investigation and emphasised the importance of this world heritage building.

In 2007, approval was given to proposals for a major regeneration project. As of 2018, the building and adjacent area of the dock accommodated a marina.

=== Electronics ===
Since IBM arrived in the town in 1951, electronics and light manufacturing have, until recently, been the mainstay of local employment. Texas Instruments (and before that National Semiconductor) ran a silicon wafer manufacturing plant in the town from 1970 until 2019, when the plant was transferred to Diodes Incorporated.

However, with manufacturing moving to Eastern Europe and Asia, work has shifted to the service sector, especially call centres. EE and IBM both have major call centre operations in Greenock, while the Royal Bank of Scotland Mortgage Centre processes Mortgage applications from throughout the UK &amp; Ireland.

IBM closed their entire factory in Greenock which is in the process of being demolished. Sanmina, another electronics company, took over much of the IBM installation but moved 370 jobs to Hungary in 2006. The Sanmina plant, which consisted of the former IBM AMDC (Automated Materials Distribution Centre) and Modules buildings 1 to 5, has since ceased operation and was demolished in 2009. The Spango Valley site was rebranded as &quot;Valley Park&quot; in late 2009. Lenovo has also re-located away from Greenock, and the plant is now at 10% of the 1999/2000 capacity. As of 2020 the site of IBM in Spango Valley had been completely demolished. 

=== Trade and commerce ===
Greenock&#x27;s main shopping thoroughfare was Hamilton Street, which connected West Blackhall Street in the west to Clyde Square in the east. In 1975, it disappeared along with several other central streets, as the area was pedestrianised as Hamilton Way. In 1992, it was covered and enclosed as an 85-unit centre by Covell and Matthews for then-clients Ossory Road Estates as &quot;The Oak Mall&quot; (in administration as of 21 November 2013). Since then, it has faced a major decline, and has been supplanted as Inverclyde&#x27;s main shopping area by the retail park in Port Glasgow. Among the current occupants of the Oak Mall include: Argos, Boots, New Look, Primark, as well as other clothing stores, restaurants, cafes and discount stores. 

In 1936, a Marks and Spencer store was opened. The original building became part of the Oak Mall, which was simply built during the first phase of pedestrianisation, where it remained until the store closed down, and moved to a new unit in Port Glasgow. In its place, is a collection of separate small markets, under the unit name of Bluebell Walk. Popular retail chain Woolworths used to operate in a unit in the Oak Mall until it fell into administration. It was replaced by a Wilkinsons store, which soon saw the same fate as its predecessor. It is now a Poundland.

The Oak Mall has had several issues for many years, such as flooding caused by leaks from the ageing and deterioration of the A78 flyover that is above the Oak Mall. As of major redevelopment projects taking place in Greenock, the eastern side of the Oak Mall, as well as the A78 flyover, and Hector McNeil House will be demolished in the beginning of 2025 after many years of plans and discussions.

On 24 November 1970, Tesco opened their first Scottish store in Greenock, on Westburn Street. It later operated under Bejam, which was bought by Iceland, who currently operates in the same location. Tesco has also operated in 3 other stores in Greenock: The store on West Stewart Street was the replacement after the first store closed. The other stores operated on Inverkip Street and Dalrymple Street. The latter is currently the only Tesco store, which also has a filling station on-site.

Other major supermarket chains, such as Aldi, Lidl and Morrisons also have a presence in the town. A small retail estate containing stores and restaurants is opposite the &quot;Waterfront&quot; swimming pool and leisure centre. Elsewhere, small groups of shops in most of the areas of the town provide for everyday essentials.

== Transport ==

Greenock is Scotland&#x27;s best served town in terms of railway stations. It boasts eight: Bogston, Cartsdyke, Greenock Central, Greenock West, Fort Matilda, Whinhill, Drumfrochar and Branchton. A ninth station, located at the former IBM complex, is currently mothballed pending redevelopment of the site. Only Glasgow has a much greater number of stations and Edinburgh possesses only two more. Greenock has a railway tunnel at in length. Located directly under Newton Street in the town, the tunnel allowed for the extension of the railway to Gourock.

A new £20m ocean terminal was opened in August 2023, which will see more than 100 cruise ships yearly. The terminal has already seen many major ships, such as the new Cunard ship MS Queen Anne as part of its maiden voyage. In March 2024, Princess Anne visited Greenock on a royal engagement, as part of the 60th anniversary of the MV Hebridean Princess, who was at the time docked nearby. The ocean terminal was part of the visit, where Princess Anne received a tour of the terminal, and learned more about the area, and its history.

Greenock is served by a number of local bus routes covering the majority of Greenock, Gourock and Port Glasgow. Long-distance services travel regularly to Glasgow, Largs and Dunoon. The majority of routes are run by McGill&#x27;s Bus Services. The Largs to Glasgow corridor is served by two services, the 901, 906, which provide a bus along this route every 15 minutes for most of the day. The 531 service also offers travel from Greenock to Glasgow, serving the Slaemuir area of Port Glasgow before connecting with the X7 Service and continuing through Bridge of Weir, Houston and Linwood, then joining the motorway to Braehead before heading into Glasgow City Centre.

Greenock is located at the end of the A8 road/M8 motorway which begins in Edinburgh. It is also the northern terminus of Euroroute E05 which heads south through England, France and Spain, ending at the Spanish port and container terminal of Algeciras.

== Culture ==
Greenock is home to the world&#x27;s first Burns Club, The Mother Club, which was founded in 1801 by merchants born in Ayrshire, some of whom had personally known Robert Burns. They held the world&#x27;s first Burns Supper on what they believed was his birthday on 29 January 1802, but the following year; discovered from the Ayr parish records that the correct date was actually 25 January 1759.

The Victorian landscape artist John Atkinson Grimshaw depicted a somewhat idealised Greenock in several of his paintings.

The Watt Institution (McLean Museum) is the largest museum in the Inverclyde area. Among the museums collection are exhibitions on James Watt, fine arts, exhibits about the history of shipbuilding on the Clyde, and a collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts.

The Beacon Arts Centre opened in 2013 in a new building at Greenock&#x27;s Custom House Quay. It provides a 500-seat theatre that hosts a regular programme of plays, concerts, musical events, comedians and other events and a Studio Theatre, as well as a multifunction Gallery Suite providing rehearsal and meeting rooms which combine for event or performance space, with views over the Clyde. On the ground floor a café &amp; bar also haas wide views. The Beacon is owned by the Greenock Arts Guild, and replaced the former &quot;Arts Guild Theatre&quot;.

Along the Custom House Quay is The Wyllieum, a museum commemorating George Wyllie, a Scottish artist who in his later life resided in Inverclyde. The museum opened in April 2024.

Greenock hosted the National Mòd in 1904 and 1925.

=== In television ===

The 1974 BBC Scotland adaptation of the &quot;Para Handy&quot; novels, entitled &quot;The Vital Spark&quot;, was filmed in Greenock. In 2012, Greenock became the setting for the BBC television drama &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;, after the series was relocated from Rochdale, Greater Manchester. The series was shot at Greenock Academy, a former secondary school in the west of the town. The British TV series &quot;Annika&quot; uses the Beacon Arts Centre as the homicide unit&#x27;s base.

=== In film ===
Greenock has featured as the backdrop to several films: the television films &quot;Just a Boys&#x27; Game&quot; (1979), &quot;Down Where the Buffalo Go&quot; (1988) and &quot;Down Among the Big Boys&quot; (1993) and the cinema films &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; (2002), &quot;Dear Frankie&quot; (2004) and &quot;Badla&quot; (2019). An early Danny Boyle film &quot;Leaving&quot; (1988) was shot here. In &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, which is set in the mid-eighteenth century, Greenock is referred to as &quot;the port to new world&quot;.

=== In literature ===
Greenock is one of the settings for Alan Sharp&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;A Green Tree in Gedde&quot;. It is fictionalised as &#x27;Gantock&#x27; by Robin Jenkins in his 1979 novel &quot;Fergus Lamont&quot; (The Gantocks are a rocky shoal in the Firth of Clyde nearby, just off Dunoon). Alasdair Gray&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;1982, Janine&quot; is set in a Greenock hotel room. Matthew Fitt&#x27;s cyberpunk novel &quot;But&#x27;n&#x27;Ben A-Go-Go&quot; features a submerged Greenock after the effects of global warming. Greenock has featured in the poetry of W.S. Graham (evoking his childhood) and Douglas Dunn.

Greenock features in Charles Nodier&#x27;s 1832 romantic fairy-tale novel &quot;La fée aux miettes&quot; as the original home and final destination of the eponymous &quot;Crumb Fairy,&quot; who, at the beginning of the story is trapped in France. In &quot;Promenade from Dieppe to the Mountains of Scotland&quot;, his account of a 50-day journey to Scotland in 1821, Nodier described Greenock as “one of the ornaments of Renfrewshire” (&quot;la charmante ville de Greenok [sic], un des ornements de Renfrew&quot;).

The novel &quot;The Greenock Murders&quot; by Kieran James (2021) is set in Greenock, especially the Cartsdyke area of town around Grosvenor Road, and the pubs of Gourock including the Kempock bar and Monteith&#x27;s (now closed).

=== Media ===
The town has a daily evening newspaper, &quot;The Greenock Telegraph&quot;, dating from 1857.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Scotland and STV Central. Television signals are received from the Black Hill TV transmitter or one of the local relay transmitters (Rosneath and Ravenscraig ). An internet-based TV station – Inverclyde TV – is run by Creative Industries students at Greenock&#x27;s West College Scotland.

Inverclyde FM on line is a community Internet radio station run by volunteers.

The town is also served by nation-wide radio stations, BBC Radio Scotland, Clyde 1, Greatest Hits Radio Glasgow &amp; The West, Heart Scotland, and Capital Scotland.

=== Notable people ===

The most famous Greenockian is the engineer James Watt. He is remembered in several placenames in the town, in the library instituted in his memory, and by the original Watt Memorial School (later College) building on the site of his birthplace in William Street, which incorporates a commemorative statue. The Finnart Campus of the local college was until 2014 known as the James Watt College. Wetherspoons opened the James Watt pub after the building was converted from its previous use as the General Post Office.

The Lady Octavia park and sports centre are named after Lady Octavia Grosvenor, wife of the local MP Sir Michael Shaw-Stewart, who died in 1921.

Pirate William Kidd claimed on death row that he was born in Greenock, but subsequent evidence has shown that he was born either in Belfast or Dundee.

Robert Burns&#x27; lover Mary Campbell (Highland Mary) and her father sailed from Campbeltown to visit her brother in Greenock early in October 1786. Her brother fell ill with typhus, which she caught while nursing him. She died of typhus on 20 or 21 October 1786, and was buried in the Old West Kirk graveyard. In 1842 increasing interest in their romance led to a monument being erected by public subscription to mark the grave. In 1920 when the church site was needed to expand Harland and Wolff&#x27;s shipyard, the monument was moved to its present site in Greenock Cemetery, with her remains being transferred to a casket and re-interred with due ceremony. The church itself was moved and rebuilt in its current location at the west end of the Esplanade in 1926.

The novelist John Galt, who founded Guelph, Ontario in 1827, lived in the town and based some of his work, most notably &quot;Annals of the Parish&quot; (1821), on Greenock and surrounding towns.

In 1972, the town was also the host of the first official international women&#x27;s football match played in Britain. The game, between Scotland and England, resulted in a 3-2 win for England.

Leisure facilities in Greenock are primarily provided by Inverclyde Leisure. There are several sports facilities in the town and surrounding area managed by Inverclyde Leisure:

* Waterfront Leisure Complex
* Greenock Sports Centre
* Lady Octavia Sports Centre
* Boglestone Community Centre and Fitness Gym
* Ravenscraig Sports Centre
* Battery Park Pavilion
* Gourock Fitness Gym
* Gourock Outdoor Swimming Pool
* Birkmyre Park Fitness Gym (Kilmacolm)
In 2009, plans were proposed to build a new multi-purpose facility at Rankin Park. In 2021, more plans were proposed that would build indoor tennis courts, along with other facilities. However, due to rising costs, it is uncertain whether it will go ahead, or be scrapped.

<doc id="351238" wikidata="Q607372" url="?curid=351238" title="Puy de Dôme">
<text>Puy de Dôme (, ) is a lava dome and one of the youngest volcanoes in the region of Massif Central in central France. This chain of volcanoes including numerous cinder cones, lava domes and maars is far from the edge of any tectonic plate. Puy de Dôme was created by a Peléan eruption, some 10,700 years ago. It is approximately from Clermont-Ferrand. The Puy-de-Dôme is named after the volcano.

== History ==

In pre-Christian Europe, Puy de Dôme was an assembly place for spiritual ceremonies. Temples were built at the summit, including a Gallo-Roman temple of Mercury, the ruins of which were discovered in 1872.

In 1648, Florin Périer, at the urging of Blaise Pascal, supported Evangelista Torricelli&#x27;s theory that barometric observations were caused by the weight of air by measuring the height of a column of mercury at three elevations on Puy de Dôme.

In 1875, a physics laboratory was built at the summit. Since 1956, a TDF () antenna is also located there. On the top of the mountain, there is a transmitter for FM radio and TV.

==Tourism==

A UNESCO World Heritage site since 2018, the Puy de Dôme is one of the most visited sites in the Auvergne region, attracting nearly 500,000 visitors a year. The summit offers expansive views of the Chaîne des Puys and Clermont-Ferrand. It is a well-known centre for paragliding.

The summit can be reached by two pedestrian paths. The southern one, (&quot;The Mule Trail&quot;), was formerly a Roman road. The northern one, (&quot;The Goat Trail&quot;), runs past the (Hen&#x27;s Nest} crater. The GR 4 long-distance trail includes both paths to cross the mountain.

Since May 2012, visitors can also go up the mountain by train with the , a rack railway.

A road exists along the railway but it is closed to general traffic, except for the military, service vehicles or emergencies.

At the top of the mountain, restaurants and shops are available as well as a visitor centre giving information on the history and geology of the area.

===Geological heritage site===
In respect of its key role in the development of volcanology as a geoscience discipline, the Puy-de-Dôme and Petite-Puy-de-Dôme volcanoes were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 &quot;geological heritage sites&quot; around the world in a listing published in October 2022.

== Sport ==
=== Cycling ===
In more recent times, Puy de Dôme has served as an occasional stage finish in the Tour de France. It was here that in 1964 Raymond Poulidor battled with Jacques Anquetil in one of the race&#x27;s most famous moments, racing side by side up almost the entire climb; and that in 1975 Eddy Merckx was punched in the kidney by a spectator.

Between the 1988 and 2023 Tour de France summit finishes, only the first part of the ascent to the Col de Ceyssat was covered in the 13th stage of the 2020 Tour de France. The 2012 construction of the Puy de Dôme rack railway narrowed the already very narrow road to the top. Because of the increasing logistical demands of the Tour, many thought that the Tour would never return after 1988 but the 9th stage of the 2023 Tour de France had a summit finish, which was won by Michael Woods. However, spectators were not permitted on the climb. 

The road is open to cyclists only during very limited periods when other vehicles are prohibited. In 2006 this was 7–9am on Wednesdays and Sundays between 1 May and 30 September. In 2017, it was the first checkpoint in the Transcontinental Race, a nonstop, unsupported bicycle race across Europe.

=== Motorsports ===
The Circuit de Charade was a motorsport street circuit built in 1957 using pre-existing roads around the base of the Puy de Dôme. The venue hosted the French Grand Prix as well as the French motorcycle Grand Prix several times in the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1986, the track was shortened due to safety issues and was converted into a dedicated motorsport race track hosting track days, driving schools as well as historic motorsport events.

== Climate ==
While the lower areas of the mountain are firmly oceanic (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), Puy de Dôme has a humid continental (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) with borderline subalpine characteristics, thanks to its high elevation. Its classification is determined from its January average being well below the threshold (with as its usual lows), and from having over four months of average temperatures that exceed . (The requirement for this climate category is to have at least three such months.)

<text>A volcano observatory is an institution that conducts research and monitoring of a volcano.

Each observatory provides continuous and periodic monitoring of the seismicity, other geophysical changes, ground movements, volcanic gas chemistry, and hydrologic conditions and activity between and during eruptions. They also provide a detailed record of eruptions in progress.

==Monitor==

These observations serve to characterize eruptive behavior, identify the nature of precursory activity leading to eruption, define the processes by which different types of deposits are emplaced, and specify the hazards that could be unleashed by each kind of eruption. From direct observation of precursory signs, it is possible to anticipate eruptions. In times of volcanic unrest, observatories issue warnings and recommendations - they take on an advisory role for decision-making governmental civil defense agencies (the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the U.S. or the Protezione Civile in Italy) and ideally continue producing observational data.

Earthquakes
Underlying all observatory operations is an ongoing program of fundamental research in volcanic processes, supplemented by collaborative studies with universities, government agencies (in the U.S. for instance with other US Geological Survey centers, and NOAA), industry and non-governmental organizations. Such research typically includes direct interpretation of the monitoring and eruption data, and it leads to formulation of conceptual models that can be tested by theoretical or laboratory simulations of volcanic systems.

Almost all observatories are members of the World Organization of Volcano Observatories (WOVO). The oldest volcano observatory is the Osservatorio Vesuviano (founded 1841) in Naples, now a member of the Italian government agency INGV.

<doc id="351240" wikidata="Q494168" url="?curid=351240" title="Renault Korea">
<text>Renault Korea Co., Ltd. () is a South Korean car manufacturer headquartered in Busan where its single assembly site is also located, with additional facilities at Seoul (administration), Giheung (research and development) and Daegu (vehicle testing).

The company was first established as Samsung Motors in 1994 by the chaebol Samsung, with technical assistance from Nissan. It started selling cars in 1998, just before South Korea was hit by the East Asian financial crisis. In 2000, it became a subsidiary of the French car manufacturer Renault, being renamed Renault Samsung Motors, while Samsung maintained a minority ownership. It adopted Renault Korea Motors as trade name in March 2022 and as its legal name in August. In December 2022, Geely acquired a minority ownership in the company through capital increase as part of wider partnership agreement with Renault, although it still is a consolidated subsidiary of the latter. In April 2024, the company adopted its present name.

Renault Korea markets a range of cars, including electric models and crossovers.

==History==

===Beginnings: Samsung Group era (1994–2000)===
In the early 1990s, Samsung&#x27;s Chairman Lee Kun-hee recognised the automotive industry as the culmination of several others. For the Samsung Group, this would allow to leverage resources and technologies from the entire group including Samsung Electrics and Samsung Electronics. He initially tried to take control of Kia, but competition from other bidders and legal restrictions led to him dropping the idea. Kia was eventually purchased by Hyundai.

Lee decided to create a new carmaker, Samsung Motors (also known as SMI) and a truck manufacturer, Samsung Commercial Vehicles Co., Ltd. (), the latter through Samsung Heavy Industries with Nissan Diesel&#x27;s support. SMI was established in 1994 (incorporated in 1995) and Daegu-based Samsung Commercial Vehicles in 1996. Shortly after SMI started its operations, the Asian financial crisis hit. Samsung divested itself of SMI as well as other non-core subsidiaries. SMI was put up for sale, with Daewoo Motors being one of the first interested companies, but, as the crisis deepened, Daewoo Motors itself was bought by GM. Hyundai Motors was also considered as a possible buyer, but corporate politics and strife between the Samsung Group and the Hyundai Group made this impossible. Negotiations with Renault started in December 1998, and in September 2000 the French automaker bought a 70% stake for . Samsung Commercial Vehicles was kept by Samsung, but finally it filed for bankruptcy at the end of 2000.

Coupled with his interest on cars, Lee&#x27;s project of building SMI as a global automotive company started out with technical assistance from Nissan, a company which at the time of SMI&#x27;s early stages was in dire financial straits. SMI&#x27;s affiliation with Nissan could have been one of the reasons for Renault buying a major share of the company, as Renault had become a major shareholder of Nissan by then. One of the very early planners for SMI has stated that technical affiliations for SMI were initially considered with Volkswagen, BMW or Honda. From 1998, Renault Samsung Motors sold cars in Chile with the introduction of the SQ5 (the current SM5).

===Later developments: Renault era (2000–present)===

====Product and market expansion (2000–2010)====
After the 2000 acquisition, Renault renamed Samsung Motors as Renault Samsung Motors (RSM). That year, the company&#x27;s sales began to improve. Journalists attribute this to the success of the first car manufactured at Busan in taxi fleets (the SM5), which led to increased confidence of the model within the rest of their customer base. During the following years, the company introduced a new vehicle range, including the SM3 in 2002, the SM7 in 2004 and the crossover QM5 in 2007. Over time, RSM changed its products from a Nissan-based architecture to a Renault-based one. As part of the Renault group, Renault Samsung became an export-oriented manufacturer.

In 2005, Renault increased its stake by acquiring an additional 10% share from the company&#x27;s creditors. On 26 June 2009, Renault and Samsung agreed to renew the right of the former to use the &quot;Samsung&quot; trade mark on its products until 2020.

====Decline in sales, electric vehicles and recovery attempts (2010–2022)====

The pressure from both Hyundai and Kia, dominant automakers in the South Korean market, increased during the 2010s, pushing RSM sales down by 27% in 2011. In the first half of 2012, they fell 41%. In August 2012, a personnel reduction of about 80% of employees was presented by management. Finally, Renault reduced its Busan personnel by 15% (about 800 employees). With the aim of reviving the company, it invested (together with Nissan) to make Nissan Rogues for export to improve production output and also presented revised versions of the SM3 and SM5. During 2013, the company started to market a new compact crossover, the QM3, based on the Captur. By late 2015, its cumulative sales since 2000 in the South Korean market reached 1.5 million units. In 2016, Renault Samsung introduced the SM6, a new mid-size model which is a Talisman with some minor changes for the South Korean market, and the crossover QM6. In 2018, the company introduced the Clio and the Master. By 2019, production and sales were again declining, and the company announced an extension of its contract with Nissan for continuing the assembly of Nissan Rogues until March 2020, although in a reduced capacity to secure production volume. RSM also announced plans to gain more production orders from parent Renault. Tensions with labour increased, as the company started an early retirement plan aimed at reducing the workforce. During 2019, Renault Samsung discontinued most of its saloon models to focus on crossover SUVs. In June 2019, the company ended production of the SM5. At the end of the year, the internal combustion engined-SM3 and the SM7 were also put out of production, with sales ending by January 2020. In March 2020, the company put on sale the XM3 crossover.

In 2012, RSM introduced an electric version of its SM3 car known as the SM3 Z.E., imported from Turkey. In October 2013 the car started to be assembled at the Busan plant and in the same year it became the leading electric vehicle by sales in South Korea with a 58% market share. In 2016, RSM also announced its intention to market the Twizy which was launched in 2017. In 2020, the company started to sell the imported Zoe. In May 2016, the company announced a project to develop and produce a 1-tonne electric light commercial vehicle with a 250-kilometre range on a single charge in partnership with local companies.

, Chile was the only major market outside South Korea that RSM has sold its cars under the Renault Samsung Motors marque and not as rebadged Renaults. In 2015, Renault Samsung badging was replaced entirely by Renault in Chile, with the vehicles themselves now being known under their global Renault names (e.g. the Renault Samsung SM5 is the Renault Latitude).

In August 2020, RSM said it did not intend to renew the agreement to use the &quot;Samsung&quot; trade mark set to end that month, although it would keep using the Samsung name for a further two years as part of a &quot;grace&quot; clause. In March 2022, the company dropped the Samsung name, adopting the trade name Renault Korea Motors and starting the process of changing the legal name by August.

====Geely involvement (2022–present)====

In January 2022, RSM&#x27;s parent Renault and Geely signed an agreement by which the South Korean manufacturer would produce vehicles based on the latter Compact Modular Architecture platform, initially intended for the domestic market. Production is set to start by 2024. In May 2022, Renault said a Geely subsidiary was set to acquire a 34.02% of Renault Korea Motors through capital increase as part of their partnership, although the company would continue to be majority owned by Renault and a consolidated subsidiary of it. The capital increase operation was completed by the end of the year, leaving Renault with a 52.9% majority stake. Samsung share (through Samsung Card) was reduced from 19.9% to 13.1%. Samsung is planning to divest its shares.

In April 2024, the company changed its trade and legal name to Renault Korea, removing &quot;Motors&quot; and, except for the SM6, moved all its locally sold products completely to the Renault marque.

In June 2024, Renault Korea introduced its first Geely-based vehicle, the Renault Grand Koleos.

==Facilities==

===Manufacturing===
The car manufacturing plant is located at Busan in the Sinho Regional Industrial Site and began production in 1998. It covers 1,650,000 m2 and has the capacity to manufacture 300,000 cars per year. It can produce various models simultaneously in a single production line. The plant is divided into seven production shops (stamping, body, painting, bumper, assembly, al-casting and engine).

===Research and development===
Renault Technology Korea (), located at Giheung near Seoul, is one of the largest research and development facilities of Renault after Guyancourt&#x27;s Technocentre. It was established in 1997 as the Samsung Motors Technical Centre, being expanded in 2000 and renamed as Renault Samsung Technical Centre (). It adopted its present name in 2017.

At first, the facility was only involved in car engineering, but at the end of 2002 the RSM Design Centre () was created within it to locally design various cars manufactured by the company. In early 2013 the design branch was renamed Renault Design Asia () and was put in charge of supervising Renault&#x27;s Asian design operations.

In November 2018, Renault Samsung Motors opened a vehicle testing centre in Daegu for vehicles aimed at the Asia-Pacific market, in partnership with the city government and Korea Intelligent Automobile Parts Promotion. The facility can test electric, autonomous and connected vehicles.

In May 2023, Renault Korea Motors said it planned to open a research and development facility for electric vehicles within its Busan plant complex, in partnership with the Busan.

===Administration===
From 1995 until 2013, the company&#x27;s head offices were at the HSBC Building in Jung District, Seoul. In January 2013, it moved them to a purposely-built facility, the RSM Tower () in Gasan-dong, Seoul. In December 2017, RSM moved most management functions to Yeoksam-dong, Seoul, although kept some offices and car maintenance activities at the RSM Tower.

There are additional administrative offices in Busan.

==Branding==
===Logos===

Renault Samsung Motors initially had two logos: the corporate logo and the marque logo. The first was for corporate communications and an adaptation of the Samsung Group&#x27;s logo. The second is the &quot;eye of the typhoon&quot; logo which was used as marque&#x27;s badge and in advertising. The imported models introduced from 2017 onwards in South Korea kept Renault&#x27;s diamond badge instead of being rebadged with the Renault Samsung logo.

In March 2022, the company introduced a flatter, two-dimensional version of the eye of the typhoon as both marque and corporate logo. The logo has lines similar to the 2021 Renault diamond logo. In April 2024, the company unified both imported and locally produced models under the Renault diamond marque logo. The SM6 was the only one set to keep the eye of the typhoon until its upcoming discontinuation in October 2024.

===Slogan===
The advertising slogan of Renault Samsung Motors is &quot;Discover the Difference&quot; () and was introduced in 2009. According to the company, it refers to the distinct quality of its products.

===Vehicle nomenclature===
Up to April 2024, the company included in its vehicles&#x27; designations numbers related to their sizes. Those numbers are 3, meaning compact or small vehicle, 5 and 6, mid-size vehicle, and 7, large vehicle. The designations also include the letters S and M, which stands for &quot;Samsung Motors&quot; and &quot;Samsung Motor Sedan&quot;. However, the sport utility vehicles replace the SM combination by QM (&quot;Quest Motoring&quot;). The imported models introduced from 2017 onwards in South Korea kept their original names instead of adopting RSM&#x27;s nomenclature. In March 2020, the company introduced the XM nomenclature for a locally produced crossover SUV. In April 2024, as most of the products were merged into the Renault branding scheme, the nomenclature system was eliminated, although two models (QM6 and SM6) kept their names.

===Typography===
In 2016, Sandoll Communications, Inc. built a Hangul version of Renault&#x27;s &quot;Renault Life&quot; font family for the company. It consists of three fonts in three weights (light, regular, bold) and one width in Roman only. The font was designed by Park Ju-seong and Wi Ye-jin, under the direction of Lee Do-kyung.

==Solar energy project==
In March 2013, Renault Samsung Motors completed the installation of solar panels in the parking lots, rooftops and surrounding land of its Busan facility to create a 20-MW solar plant, one of the largest in the world. The project was carried out through a joint venture, Busan Shinho Solar Power SPC (), formed by RSM, Korea East-West Power and KC Cottrell, which also manages the plant. It provides energy to the RSM operations and nearby houses.

<doc id="351248" wikidata="Q168704" url="?curid=351248" title="Niki de Saint Phalle">
<text>Niki de Saint Phalle (; born Catherine Marie-Agnès Fal de Saint Phalle; 29 October 193021 May 2002) was a French sculptor, painter, filmmaker, and author of colorful hand-illustrated books. Widely noted as one of the few female monumental sculptors, Saint Phalle was also known for her social commitment and work.

She had a difficult and traumatic childhood and a much-disrupted education, which she wrote about many decades later. After an early marriage and two children, she began creating art in a naïve, experimental style. She first received worldwide attention for angry, violent assemblages which had been shot by firearms. These evolved into &quot;Nanas&quot;, light-hearted, whimsical, colorful, large-scale sculptures of animals, monsters, and female figures. Her most comprehensive work was the &quot;Tarot Garden&quot;, a large sculpture garden containing numerous works ranging up to house-sized creations.

Saint Phalle&#x27;s idiosyncratic style has been called &quot;outsider art&quot;; she had no formal training in art, but associated freely with many other contemporary artists, writers, and composers. Her books and abundant correspondence were written and brightly-colored in a childish style, but throughout her lifetime she addressed many controversial and important global problems in the bold way children often use to question and call out unacceptable neglect.

Throughout her creative career, she collaborated with other well-known artists such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers, composer John Cage, and architect Mario Botta, as well as dozens of less-known artists and craftspersons. For several decades, she worked especially closely with Swiss kinetic artist Jean Tinguely, who also became her second husband. In her later years, she suffered from multiple chronic health problems attributed to repeated exposure to airborne glass fibers and petrochemical fumes from the experimental materials she had used in her pioneering artworks, but she continued to create prolifically until the end of her life.

A critic has observed that Saint Phalle&#x27;s &quot;insistence on exuberance, emotion and sensuality, her pursuit of the figurative and her bold use of color have not endeared her to everyone in a minimalist age&quot;. She was well known in Europe, but her work was little-seen in the US, until her final years in San Diego. Another critic said: &quot;The French-born, American-raised artist is one of the most significant female and feminist artists of the 20th century, and one of the few to receive recognition in the male-dominated art world during her lifetime&quot;.

== Early life and education (1930–1948) ==
Catherine Marie-Agnès Fal de Saint Phalle was born on October 29, 1930, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, near Paris. Her father was Count André-Marie de Saint Phalle (1906–1967), a French banker, and her mother was an American, named Jeanne Jacqueline Harper (1908–1980). Marie-Agnès was the second of five children, and her cousins included the French novelist Thérèse de Saint Phalle (Baroness Jehan de Drouas), her double cousin, daughter of Count Alexandre de Saint Phalle (brother of Count André-Marie) and his wife Helene Georgia Harper (sister of Jeanne Jacqueline). Another cousin was the American-born investment banker, lawyer, and former Office of Strategic Services agent Thibaut de Saint Phalle, who served in the Carter administration as a director of the Export–Import Bank of the United States (1977-1981).

Marie-Agnès was born one year after Black Tuesday, and the French economy was also suffering in the aftermath of the infamous stock market crash that initiated the Great Depression. Within months of her birth, her father&#x27;s finance company closed, and her parents moved with her oldest brother to the suburbs of New York City; she was left with her maternal grandparents in Nièvre, near the geographical center of France. Around 1933, she rejoined her parents in Greenwich, Connecticut; her father had found work as manager of the American branch of the Saint Phalle family&#x27;s bank. In 1937, the family moved to East 88th Street and Park Avenue in the affluent Upper East Side neighborhood of New York City. By this time, Marie-Agnès was known as &quot;Niki&quot;, the name she would use from then on.

Niki grew up in a strict Catholic environment, against which she repeatedly rebelled. Her mother was temperamental and violent, beating the younger children, and forcing them to eat even if they were not hungry. Both of her younger siblings, Elizabeth and Richard de Saint Phalle, would later commit suicide as adults. The atmosphere at home was tense; the only place where Niki felt comfortable and warm was in the kitchen, overseen by a black cook. Decades later, Niki would reveal that she had suffered years of sexual abuse from her father, starting at the age of 11. She would later refer to the environment where she grew up as &quot;enfer&quot; (&quot;hell&quot;).

She spent most of her childhood and adolescence in New York City, and summers in Connecticut or Long Island. She frequently returned to France to visit relatives, becoming fluent in both French and American English. In 1937, she attended school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart on East 91st Street in Manhattan. After she was expelled in 1941, she rejoined her maternal grandparents, who had moved to Princeton, New Jersey, and she briefly attended the public school there.

She returned to the Upper East Side and studied there at the Brearley School from 1942 to 1944. There, she met Jackie Matisse, granddaughter of artist Henri Matisse; they would become lifelong friends. However, Saint Phalle was dismissed for painting in red the fig leaves on the school&#x27;s classical statuary. Despite this, she would later say it was there “[that] I became a feminist. They inculcated in us that women can and must accomplish great things.” She was then enrolled in a convent school in Suffern, New York, but was expelled. She finally graduated from the Oldfields School in Glencoe, Maryland in 1947.

During her late teenage years, Saint Phalle became a fashion model; at the age of 18, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; (26 September 1949) and, three years later, on the November 1952 cover of &quot;French Vogue&quot;. She also appeared in the pages of &quot;Elle&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;.

&quot;At one point, Gloria Steinem spotted Saint Phalle walking down Fifty-seventh Street, purseless and in a cowboy getup. In an interview quoted by the show’s curator, Ruba Katrib, in the catalogue, Steinem recalled thinking, &#x27;That is the first free woman I have ever seen in real life. I want to be just like her.&#x27;&quot;

== First marriage and children (1949–1960) ==
At the age of 18, Saint Phalle married Harry Mathews, whom she had first met at the age of 11 (he was 12) through her father. Six years later, they again encountered each other by chance on a train to Princeton, and soon became a couple. Initially, they had a civil ceremony on 6 June 1949 in New York City Hall. At the urging of Niki&#x27;s mother, they also had a religious rite at the French Church of New York the following February.

Although her parents accepted the union, her husband&#x27;s family objected to her Catholic background and cut them off financially, causing them to resort to occasional shoplifting. They moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts so Mathews could study music at Harvard University. Saint Phalle began to paint in oils and gouaches but aimed to pursue a career in acting. Their first child, Laura, was born in April 1951. In 1952, the small family moved to Paris, where Harry continued his studies in conducting at I’Ecole Normale de Musique. The new parents were casual, even negligent in their care, but their children would benefit from better financial circumstances after Mathews received an inheritance.

Saint Phalle rejected the staid, conservative values of her family, which dictated domestic positions for wives and particular strict rules of conduct. Poet John Ashbery recalled that Saint Phalle&#x27;s artistic pursuits were rejected in turn by relatives: her uncle &quot;French banker Count Alexandre de Saint-Phalle, ... reportedly takes a dim view of her artistic activities&quot;, Ashbery observed. However, after marrying young and becoming a mother, she found herself living the same bourgeois lifestyle that she had attempted to escape.

For about a decade, the family would wander around France and Europe, living a bohemian lifestyle. In Nice, Saint Phalle and Mathews would have separate affairs in 1953; after she attacked her husband&#x27;s mistress, she took an overdose of sleeping pills, but they had little effect because she was manic at the time. When Harry discovered a stash of knives, razors, and scissors under a mattress, he took his wife to a mental clinic in Nice, where she was treated with electroshock therapy and insulin shock therapy. Liberated from routine household work, she focused on creating artwork instead and improved enough to be discharged in six weeks. Around the same time, her husband abandoned his music studies and started to write his first novel, eventually switching to a career in writing.

While in Paris on a modeling assignment in 1954, Saint Phalle was introduced to the American-French painter , who became both her friend and artistic mentor. He encouraged her to continue painting in her self-taught style.

In September 1954, the small family moved to Deià, Majorca, Spain, where her son Philip was born in May 1955. While in Spain, Saint Phalle read the works of Proust and visited Madrid and Barcelona, where she became deeply affected by the work of architect Antoni Gaudí. Gaudí&#x27;s influence opened many previously unimagined possibilities for Saint Phalle, especially the use of unusual materials and &quot;objets-trouvés&quot; as structural elements in sculpture and architecture. Saint Phalle was particularly struck by Gaudí&#x27;s &quot;Park Güell&quot; which would inspire her to one day create her own garden-based artwork that would combine artistic and natural elements.

Saint Phalle continued to paint, particularly after she and her family moved to Paris in the mid-1950s. Her first art exhibition was held in 1956 in Switzerland, where she displayed her naïve style of oil painting.

In 1956, she met the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely and his wife, artist Eva Aeppli. Saint Phalle attempted her first large-scale sculpture, enlisting Tinguely to make an iron armature, which she covered with plaster and paint.

In the late 1950s, Saint Phalle became ill with hyperthyroidism and tachycardia, which were eventually treated by an operation in 1958.

In 1959, Saint Phalle first encountered multiple artworks by Yves Klein, Marcel Duchamp, Daniel Spoerri, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jasper Johns. Seeing these avant-garde works triggered her &quot;first great artistic crisis&quot;. She switched from oil painting to gouaches and gloss paint, and began to produce assemblages from household objects and castoffs. By this time, she had decided to dedicate herself fully to creating art, free from the obligations of everyday family life.

In 1960, she and Harry separated by mutual agreement, and her husband moved to another apartment with their two children. At that time, her daughter Laura was nine, and her son Philip was five years old. Mathews would occasionally buy artworks from his wife as a way of providing her modest support, and she would visit him and the children periodically.

She soon moved in with Jean Tinguely, who by then had separated from his own wife, Eva Aeppli. He was becoming well known for his kinetic sculptures made from cast-off mechanisms and junk. In many ways, the pair were opposites, and sometimes had violent disagreements, and frequent affairs with others. They would live together intermittently and collaborate closely on artistic projects for over a decade before marrying in 1971. Two years later they separated, but remained on good terms and continued to collaborate on various projects up through Tinguely&#x27;s death in 1991.

In 1960, Tinguely introduced her to Pontus Hultén, then the director of the Moderna Museet (Modern Museum) in Stockholm, Sweden. Over the next few years, he would invite her to participate in important exhibitions, and acquire her artworks for the museum. He would later become the first director of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (1974–1981), where he continued to be influential in promoting wider recognition of Saint Phalle&#x27;s artwork.

== &quot;Tirs&quot; (1961–1963) ==

Saint Phalle created a series of works in the early 1960s she called &quot;Tirs&quot; (&quot;Shootings&quot; or &quot;Shots&quot;). The series began as &quot;target pictures&quot;, with painted bullseye targets prominently displayed within her painted collages, such as &quot;Saint Sébastien (Portrait of My Lover / Portrait of My Beloved / Martyr nécessaire)&quot; (1961), or &quot;Assemblage (Figure with Dartboard Head)&quot; (1962). She would invite viewers to throw darts at the dartboards embedded as faces in her figurative assemblages, which were influenced by the targets painted by her friend Jasper Johns.

Soon, she would start by embedding knives, razor blades, scissors, eggbeaters, baby-doll arms, and other household items in plaster covering a large board, along with bags filled with colorful paints, cans of spray paint, and sometimes tomato. Also, she might suspend bags of paint or cans of spray paint in front of the white-painted assemblage. She would then repeatedly shoot the assemblage with a pistol, rifle, or miniature cannon, causing the liquids to &quot;bleed&quot; or to spray out.

Her first staged public shooting event was in February 1961, attended by Jean Tinguely, Daniel Spoerri, and Pierre Restany, among others. Her early art performance/events took place in the &quot;Impasse Ronsin&quot;, a trash-strewn back alley in the Montparnasse district of Paris. This cul-de-sac was also the site of the improvised studios of Constantin Brâncuși, Jean Tinguely, Yves Klein, Max Ernst, Les Lalanne, and other experimental artists in the 1950s and 1960s.

As founder of the &quot;Nouveau réalisme&quot; (&quot;New Realist&quot;) movement, Restany asked Saint Phalle to join this group of French artists upon seeing her performance; she would become the only female member of this group.

The extreme expressions of violence attracted media attention, catapulting Saint Phalle into the ranks of avant-garde artistic rebellion. The &quot;Tirs&quot; combined performance, body art, sculpture, and painting, in the artistic ferment of the 1960s. Saint Phalle began to present variations on this process in art museums and galleries, and recruited other artists to join in staged public &quot;happenings&quot;, where some of her colleagues would also pull the trigger. At American performances, she would meet many other emerging artists, including Robert Rauschenberg, Ad Reinhardt, Frank Stella, and Ed Kienholz. She also organized indoors events at art galleries, where she would invite visitors to shoot at her assemblages.

Saint Phalle participated in Spoerri&#x27;s &quot;Edition MAT&quot; (&quot;Multiplication d’Art Transformable&quot;) program of multiple artwork editions, supplying simpler versions of her &quot;Tirs&quot; works, with detailed instructions on how to shoot them with a .22 rifle. Saint Phalle carefully documented her artistic process in the &quot;Tirs&quot; with writing, still photos, and films. She would attach common readymade artifacts to a board, attach bags of colorful paint, whitewash everything, and then dip the assemblage into milk-white plaster. Once it had dried, the collection was ready for shooting by a purchaser.

In June 1961, Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely joined Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg in a concert-happening called &quot;Variations II&quot;, orchestrated by avant-garde American composer John Cage, and held at the American Embassy in Paris. While David Tudor played Cage compositions on the piano, the artists created their works of art on stage as the audience watched the proceedings.

In August 1961, Marcel Duchamp introduced Saint Phalle and Tinguely to Salvador Dalí, who invited them to create a life-sized exploding bull with fireworks (&quot;Toro de Fuego&quot;). This &quot;Homenage a Dalí&quot; (&quot;Homage to Dalí&quot;) was wheeled out after the end of a traditional Spanish bullfight, in Figueras, Catalonia, Spain, and exploded in front of the audience.

In 1962, she had her first one-woman show in New York City, at the gallery run by Alexander Iolas. It included &quot;Homage to Le Facteur Cheval&quot;, a shooting gallery where visitors could fire on one of her &quot;Tirs&quot; installations. This began her long working relationship with the gallerist, eventually comprising at least 17 exhibitions of her work.

An exclusive 1962 open-air shooting event in the Malibu Hills above Los Angeles was attended by Hollywood celebrities, including Jane Fonda and John Houseman. Attendees from the art world included John Cage, Ed Ruscha, and Leo Castelli, while Ed Kienholz helped to manage the firearms.

In most of these public performances, Saint Phalle was impeccably dressed in a fashionable white pantsuit.

By 1963, she had taken the series to galleries in New York City and Los Angeles, inviting the public to participate in the shootings. In Los Angeles, she shot a large-scale &quot;King Kong&quot; assemblage she had constructed, paint-splattering the embedded sculpted faces of politicians such as John F Kennedy, Fidel Castro, and Charles De Gaulle, with Santa Claus and Donald Duck as well. This work would later be acquired by the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, and would mark her transition to a new series of fantastic monsters, animals, and female figures. Throughout her career, snakes, birds, and dragons would become recurring symbols in her artworks.

While in New York City, Saint Phalle and Tinguely stayed in the Hotel Chelsea in 1962, and again in 1964-1965.
In 1963, the couple purchased an old hotel, called &quot;Auberge au Cheval Blanc&quot; (&quot;White Horse Inn&quot;), in Soisy-sur-Ecole, southeast of Paris. It had previously been a hotel, a café, a cinema, and even a brothel, but the new owners converted it into artistic studios which they would share over the decades to come.

== &quot;Nanas&quot; (1964–1973) ==


Saint Phalle next explored the various roles of women, in what would develop into her best-known and most prolific series of sculptures. She started making life-size dolls of women, such as brides and mothers giving birth, monsters, and large heads. Initially, they were made of soft materials, such as wool, cloth, and papier-mâché, but they soon evolved into plaster over a wire framework and plastic toys, some painted all white.

As the series developed into larger monumental works, Saint Phalle used composite fiberglass-reinforced polyester plastic (also known as FRP or GRP) decorated with multiple bright-colored acrylic or polyester paints. She also used polyurethane foam in many of her early sculptures. These innovative materials enabled the construction of colorful, large-scale sculptures with new ease and fluidity of form. Saint Phalle unknowingly used dangerous fabrication and painting processes that released airborne glass fibers and chemicals, including styrene, epoxy, and toxic solvents.

In 1963–64, she created a series of sculptures protesting stereotypical societal roles for women, as child bearers, devouring mothers, witches, and prostitutes. Some of her early artworks from this &quot;Bride&quot; period depicted ghostly, skeletal brides dressed in white, which have been compared to Miss Havisham, an ethereal character in Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;.

Over time, these figures became more joyful, whimsical, colorful, and larger in scale. Inspired by a collaborative drawing with American artist Larry Rivers of his wife, her pregnant friend Clarice Price Rivers (1936–2024), Saint Phalle began to portray archetypal female figures with a more optimistic view of the position of women in society. &quot;Gwendoline&quot; (1965) was the first major sculpture in what would become a lifetime series of these works.

The newer figures took on ecstatic dance poses and even acrobatic positions, such as handstands and cartwheels. Saint Phalle&#x27;s light-hearted figures have been compared to the joyful dancers of Matisse and the sturdy female figures by Gaston Lachaise, Aristide Maillol, and Rodin.

By 1965, she was calling her artistic expressions of the proverbial everywoman &quot;Nanas&quot;, after a French slang word that is roughly equivalent to &quot;broad&quot;, or &quot;chick&quot;. The term also recalls the childish French taunt &quot;nananère&quot;.

The first of these freely-posed forms, made of papier-mâché, yarn, and cloth, were exhibited at the Alexander Iolas Gallery in Paris in September 1965. During this show, she joined a type of tombola raffle organized by the Artist&#x27;s Club of New York, whereby artworks were randomly left in coin-operated luggage lockers at Pennsylvania Station, and keys were offered for $10 each.

For this show, Iolas also published Saint Phalle&#x27;s first artist book that included her handwritten text in combination with her drawings of &quot;Bananas&quot;. Encouraged by Iolas, she started a highly productive output of graphics work that accompanied her exhibitions, which included silk-screened prints, posters, books, and writings. In the years to come, she would publish multiple hand-lettered books, profusely illustrated with colorful drawings and diagrams, on topics such as AIDS prevention and various periods in her life story.

In 1966, Saint Phalle collaborated with Jean Tinguely and Per Olof Ultvedt on a temporary indoor sculpture installation, &quot;Hon – en katedral&quot; (which means &quot;She-a-Cathedral&quot; in Swedish), filling a large temporary gallery in the Moderna Museet, in Stockholm, Sweden. During construction, Saint Phalle recruited Swiss art student , who had been working as a dishwasher in the museum restaurant (in the following years, he would become a vital assistant and collaborator for both Saint Phalle and Tinguely). A team of 8 people worked strenuously for 40 days, first building a frame using metal rebar, covering it with chicken wire, sheathing it with fabric attached with smelly animal glue, and then painting the inside of the enclosure black, and painting the outside in bright colors. The final structure was long and wide, weighing around . In the tabloid-sized newsprint catalog published for the show, Saint Phalle included a diagram showing the artistic influences on her design, which included Simon Rodia&#x27;s Watts Towers, Ferdinand Cheval&#x27;s &quot;Le Palais Idéal&quot;, and the architecture of Antoni Gaudi.

The outer form was a giant, reclining sculpture of a pregnant woman (a &quot;Nana&quot;), whose voluminous interior could be entered through a door-sized vaginal opening between her legs. Written on one of &quot;Hon&quot;&#x27;s massive thighs was the motto &quot;Honi soit qui mal y pense&quot; (&quot;May he be shamed who thinks badly of it&quot;). Inside the massive sculpture were a 12-seat cinema theater, a milk bar inside a breast, a fish pond, and a brain built by Tinguely, with moving mechanical parts. In addition, the sprawling &quot;Nana&quot; contained a coin telephone, a love-seat sofa, a museum of fake paintings, a sandwich vending machine, an art installation by Ultvedt, and a playground slide for children.

After an initial shocked silence, the installation elicited extensive public commentary in magazines and newspapers throughout the world, raising awareness of the Moderna Museet. Over 100,000 visitors crowded in to experience the immersive environment, including many children. At the end of 3 months, the entire temporary setup was demolished and removed, except for the head, which was preserved by the museum in its permanent collection. Some small fragments were attached to limited-edition exhibition catalogs and sold as mementos.

Around this time, Saint Phalle also designed stage sets and costumes for theatrical productions: &quot;Éloge de La Folie&quot; (&quot;Praise of the Madness&quot;, 1966), a ballet by Roland Petit; an adaptation of the Aristophanes play &quot;Lysistrata&quot; (1966); and a German-language play she co-wrote with titled &quot;ICH (All About Me)&quot; (1968). Large fixed or moveable &quot;Nana&quot; figures were prominent in several of these productions.

In 1967, Saint Phalle began working with polyester resin, a material which could be shaped easily but would transform into a hard, smooth, weather-resistant surface. This new technology enabled her to construct large, fantastical figures for display outdoors in public spaces and parks. The material is reasonably durable outdoors (similar materials are used for boats and car bodies), although decades of weather exposure can eventually cause deterioration, requiring specialized art conservation measures.

In August 1967, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam opened Saint Phalle&#x27;s first retrospective exhibition, &quot;Les Nanas au pouvoir&quot; (&quot;Nana Power&quot;). For the show, Niki created her first &quot;Nana Dream House&quot; and &quot;Nana Fountain&quot;, and also showed plans for her first &quot;Nana Town&quot;.

In 1967, she exhibited &quot;Le Paradis Fantastique&quot; (&quot;The Fantastic Paradise&quot;), a collaborative grouping of nine of her sculptures with six machines built by Tinguely, on the rooftop terrace of the 8-level French Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal. The composition was originally conceived of as an attack by Tinguely&#x27;s dark mechanical constructions upon Saint Phalle&#x27;s brightly-colored animals and female figures, a kind of &quot;amorous warfare&quot;.

Although the French Pavilion itself was popular, most visitors did not see the rooftop terrace where the sculptures were installed. In 1968, the sculptures were re-displayed at the Albright-Knox Gallery in Buffalo, New York, and then for a year in New York City&#x27;s Central Park. In 1971, some of the artworks were purchased by the Moderna Museet, and permanently installed nearby in an outdoor sculpture garden on Skeppsholmen, an island in central Stockholm.

In 1968, she first disclosed that she had developed respiratory problems from exposure to dust and fumes in making her artwork.

Starting in 1968, Saint Phalle sold &quot;Nana&quot; inflatable pool toys, which appeared in the April 1968 issue of &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine. She ignored complaints from art critics, focusing on raising money for her future monumental projects. In the coming years, she would face more criticism for over-commercializing and popularizing her artwork, but she raised significant funding that enabled her to finance several ambitious projects on her own. Her production of smaller, lower-cost objects also placed her art within reach of more supporters of her causes. During her career, she produced clothing, jewelry, perfume, glass or porcelain figures, furniture, and craft items, many with a &quot;Nana&quot; theme.

From 1969 to 1971, she worked on her first full-scale architecture project, three small sculptural houses commissioned by Rainer von Diez in southern France, which she called &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Dream of the Bird&quot;). The project was a collaboration with him and Jean Tinguely, and a forerunner of her later &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; project.

In 1969, she joined several other artists under the lead of Tinguely, starting work on &quot;Le Cyclop&quot; (&quot;Cyclops&quot;, also known as &quot;La Tête&quot;, &quot;The Head&quot;, or &quot;le Monstre dans la forêt&quot;, &quot;the Monster in the forest&quot;), in Milly-la-Forêt, near Paris. Collaborators included Daniel Spoerri, Bernhard Luginbuhl, and Eva Aeppli. Eventually, 15 different people worked on the project, which would not be considered finished until 1994.

In 1969 in an interview on television in her studio, she shared her views about the place of women in politics and said &quot;I think women could administer this world much better. If Black power and women power would get together, they would take over everything. That&#x27;s the solution. A new world of joy.&quot;

In November 1970, as part of an artists&#x27; reunion celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Nouveaux Réalistes, Saint Phalle shot at an altar assemblage.

On 13 July 1971, Saint Phalle and Tinguely legally married, perhaps for tax savings, as Saint Phalle thus became a Swiss citizen. Their marriage did give the two artists mutual control over each other&#x27;s artistic estate if one of them should die. That same year, she designed her first pieces of jewelry.

In 1972, she installed &quot;Golem&quot;, commissioned by the then mayor Teddy Kollek, at a children&#x27;s playground in the Kiryat Hayovel neighborhood of Jerusalem. It is a giant monster with three red tongues protruding from its mouth, which serve as playground slides. This project was the first time she used the shotcrete method of spraying concrete over a metal framework to produce large structures; this method would be used in her further major projects.

Starting in 1972, she engaged Robert Haligon (&quot;Fabricant de Plastiques d’Art&quot;) to help fabricate her large-scale sculptures, as well as various editions of artworks. This collaboration would continue for 25 years, including all four of his children, notably Gérard, who would take the lead in later years. The collaboration would produce approximately 3,000 sculptures, ranging from monumental outdoors pieces to small multiple editions. Saint Phalle personally trained daughter Marie Haligon to paint her multiple edition sculptures, following a master artist&#x27;s prototype. Initially, the artist preferred a matte paint finish, shunning shiny surfaces. However, she was forced to adopt glossy surface finishes to attain improved durability of the paints on her outdoors sculptures. Over time, she embraced this glossy visual effect, and began using mirrors and polished stones to surface her artworks.

In 1972, Saint Phalle shot footage for her surreal horror film &quot;Daddy&quot;, about a deeply troubled father-daughter love-hate relationship. The filming was done in a rented castle near Grasse in southeastern France in association with filmmaker Peter Whitehead. In November, the film was shown in London. The following January, she produced a new version of the film, with additional scenes in Soisy and New York, and an expanded cast. The revised version premiered at Lincoln Center for the 11th New York Film Festival in April. She was also commissioned to design the cover of the program for the festival.

In 1973, Saint Phalle worked with Tinguely and Rico Weber on a commission from Roger and Fabienne Nellens to build a playhouse in the garden of their home in seaside Knokke-le-Zoute, Belgium. The &quot;Le Dragon&quot; they built was a substantial structure, high and long, made using techniques derived from the earlier &quot;Le Rêve de l&#x27;oiseau&quot; and &quot;Golem&quot; projects. The fantastical building would eventually include a kitchen, bathroom, toilet, heating system, and bedroom, at an estimated cost of $30,000 to $40,000. The exterior was decorated with bright paintings, including ones done by Roger Nellens and the Formula 1 race-car driver Jacky Ickx. Similar to the &quot;Golem&quot; project the previous year, a long tongue formed an exterior slide from the upper level.

In 1987, graffiti artist Keith Haring would live in &quot;Le Dragon&quot; while working on a mural commissioned by Roger Nellens at nearby Knokke Casino, and would return for at least three summers. With Saint Phalle&#x27;s enthusiastic consent, he would paint a long fresco along an interior stairway wall. Eventually, the building would be designated a Monument Historique of Belgium, though it would remain private property.

Saint Phalle continued to create &quot;Nanas&quot; for the rest of her life, but would soon focus her attention on a comprehensive project in Italy.

== &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; (1974–1998) ==

In 1955, Saint Phalle had visited Antoni Gaudí&#x27;s Parc Güell in Barcelona, Spain, which inspired her to use diverse materials and found objects as essential elements in her art. Another influence was the Parco dei Mostri in Bomarzo, in the Lazio region of Italy. In the late 1950s, she and Jean Tinguely had visited &quot;Le Palais Idéal&quot; built by Ferdinand Cheval (known as &quot;Le Facteur Cheval&quot;) in Hauterives, France, as well as Simon Rodia&#x27;s &quot;Watts Towers&quot; in Los Angeles in the early 1960s. Both these latter locations were examples of fantastical outsider art and architecture built by ordinary working men of modest means but an expansive vision. Saint Phalle decided that she wanted to make something similar: a magnificent sculpture garden, but created by a woman.

The founding sponsors for her ambitious project were members of the Italian Agnelli family. In 1974, Saint Phalle became ill with a pulmonary abscess from her work with polyester and was hospitalized in Arizona. She then recuperated in St. Moritz, Switzerland. She reconnected with Marella Agnelli, a friend from the 1950s in New York, and told Agnelli about her ideas for a fantasy garden. In 1978, Agnelli&#x27;s brothers Carlo and Nicola Caracciolo offered a parcel of their land in Tuscany for the garden&#x27;s site.

In 1974, Saint Phalle created a trio of monumental &quot;Nana&quot;s installed next to the River Leine in Hanover, Germany. City leaders were initially inundated with over 20,000 letters of complaint, but eventually the figures were affectionately nicknamed &quot;Sophie&quot;, &quot;Charlotte&quot;, and &quot;Caroline&quot; in honor of three of the city&#x27;s historical women. The dispute between supporters and opponents of the statues was resolved by a tug-of-war contest.

In 1975, Saint Phalle wrote the screenplay for &quot;Un rêve plus long que la nuit&quot; (&quot;A Dream Longer Than the Night&quot;, later also called &quot;Camélia et le Dragon&quot;), and she recruited many of her artist friends to help make it into a film, a phantasmagorical tale of dragons, monsters, and adolescence. A young girl is held captive by a dragon, manages to escape, and must explore &quot;Sept Portes du Mystère&quot; (&quot;Seven Doors of Mystery&quot;) to find love. Saint Phalle&#x27;s daughter Laura was the lead character in the film, appearing with Saint Phalle, Jean Tinguely, and other artist friends; Peter Whitehead composed the music. For the filming, she designed several pieces of furniture, which were later displayed on the facade of the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. From 1968 to 1988, she also worked on &quot;Last Night I Had a Dream&quot;, a sculptural relief painting that included many elements from her earlier life and dreams.

In 1976, she retreated to the Swiss Alps to refine her plans for the sculpture park. In 1977 Ricardo Menon, an Argentinian, became her assistant; he would work closely with her until 1986.

In 1977, she worked with the English writer Constantin Mulgrave to design sets for &quot;The Traveling Companion&quot;, based on a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, but the project was never completed. She and Mulgrave lived together for around four years, but Tinguely remained a continually reappearing presence in her life.

In 1977, she also visited Mexico and New Mexico, in search of more extensive artistic inspirations.

In 1978, Saint Phalle started to lay out her sculpture garden in an abandoned quarry in Garavicchio, Tuscany, about north-west of Rome near the west coast of the Italian peninsula. The following year, sites were cleared, and foundations were established.

In 1979, she produced the first of what would become a new series of sculptures, the &quot;Skinnies&quot;. These were flat, planar, see-through outlines of heads and figures, highlighted by patches of color. In some ways, they resembled her colorful sketches and drawings but scaled up to monumental size. The series also symbolized Saint Phalle&#x27;s struggles against emphysema and illness. She continued to produce her &quot;Nanas&quot; in addition to her new style of sculpture, and both styles of figures would appear in her &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; project.

In 1980, Saint Phalle and her team began to build the first architectural sculpture in the garden. As the project progressed, Saint Phalle started taking lessons in the Italian language, to better communicate with local workers. The second crew member she hired was Ugo Celletti, a 50-year-old part-time postal delivery man, who discovered a love for mosaic work on the project. He would work on the project for 36 years and recruit his nephews to join in; some family members are still involved in maintaining the site.

She invited artist friends from Argentina, Scotland, Holland, and France to help work on the sculptures. Over time, Saint Phalle worked with dozens of people, including architects, ceramicists, ironworkers, bricklayers, painters, and mosaic artists. The materials used in the &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; project would include steel, iron, cement, polyester, ceramic, mosaic glass, mirrors, and polished stones (which she called &quot;M&amp;M&#x27;s&quot;).

The structure of the more massive sculptures was very similar to the temporary &quot;Hon&quot; installation at the Moderna Museet in 1966, but this time the artworks were outdoors and needed to withstand the long-term weathering effects of sun and rain. The basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar. A second layer of lighter-gauge steel reinforcement bars was added, followed by two layers of expanded metal. A specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure. A layer of tar for waterproofing and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy, hollow structure ready for decoration.

In 1980, she also began selling a series of polyester snake chairs, vases, and lamps. That year, she recorded her first attack of rheumatoid arthritis, a painful disease affecting the joints of the skeleton.

In 1980–1981, she designed a colorful paint scheme for a Piper Aerostar 602 P twin-engine airplane, which participated in the first trans-Atlantic race sponsored by the Peter Stuyvesant Foundation of Amsterdam. As an act of playful rebellion against the cigarette manufacturer sponsor, she added a &quot;No Smoking&quot; sign visible on the belly of the plane (she was allergic to tobacco smoke).

In 1981, Saint Phalle rented a small house near the &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; and hired young people from Garavicchio to help with construction of the garden. Jean Tinguely led a Swiss team, comprising Seppi Imhoff and Rico Weber, and started welding the frames of the sculptures. The following year, Dutch artist Doc Winsen (also called &quot;Dok van Winsen&quot;) took up the welding operations.

In 1982, Saint Phalle developed and marketed an eponymous perfume, using the proceeds to help finance her project. The perfume bottle top featured a small sculpture of two intertwined snakes, one golden and the other brightly multicolored. This was one of the first of what came to be called celebrity perfumes, using fame and name recognition to sell scented products. She may have raised as much as a third of the funds she needed for the garden in this way. She actively solicited funding from friends and acquaintances, as well as by selling her artworks.
In August 1982, Saint Phalle was honored at the Street Festival of the Arts in New York City. Later that year, Saint Phalle collaborated with Tinguely to produce the &quot;Stravinsky Fountain&quot;, a 15-piece sculptural fountain for Igor Stravinsky Square, located next to the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. Because of its prominent location in Paris, it would become one of the best-known collaborations between the two artists.

From 1983 until 1988 when on site, Saint Phalle lived in a small apartment built into &quot;The Empress&quot;, a house-sized sphinx-like sculpture in the garden. On the second level, her bedroom was inside one breast, and her kitchen was inside the other one. Each of these two rooms had a single recessed circular window, appearing as an inverted nipple when viewed from the outside. In 2000, she would recall: &quot;At last, my lifelong wish to live inside a sculpture was going to be granted: a space entirely made out of undulating curves ... I wanted to invent a new mother, a mother goddess, and be reborn within its form ... I would sleep in one breast. In the other, I would put my kitchen&quot;.

The ground floor contained a large mirrored space with a mirrored dining table where she would serve lunch to workers and artists, beneath a chandelier Tinguely had made with a cow skull. She used this motherly role to help reinforce her authority in directing the team of men she needed to help build her project. Eventually, she would grow tired of the cramped space &quot;in the womb of her mother&quot;, and after 1988 would move into a New-York-loft-style studio which she had built for herself underground at the site. Her assistant Ricardo Menon would live in the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; structure while on site, working closely with Saint Phalle and caring for her during crippling arthritis flareups.

Around 1983, Saint Phalle decided to cover her &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; sculptures primarily in durable ceramic colored tiles, adding shards of mirrors and glass, and polished stones. Menon helped her recruit Venera Finocchiaro, a ceramics teacher from Rome; she taught local women new techniques for molding ceramic pieces to curved surfaces and installed on-site ovens to finish the pieces. Starting in 1985, Jean Tinguely added motorized and stationary steel sculptures and fountains to the project. Robert Haligon and his sons did much of the work which involved polyester resins. Saint Phalle asked Pierre Marie Lejeune to create a cement path, which he inscribed with hieroglyphs, other signs and symbols, and text. During this period, Saint Phalle dedicated almost all of her time to living and working in the garden.

In 1986 Menon left to attend a drama school in Paris, but kept secret from Saint Phalle that he had contracted AIDS. While there, he recruited fellow Argentinian Marcelo Zitelli to work for Saint Phalle as a gardener, but he in turn became her assistant for other work as well, helping her fabricate sculptures for at least the next decade.

The same year, Saint Phalle took some time to collaborate with (a German medical professor of immunology) in writing and illustrating her book &quot;AIDS: You Can’t Catch It Holding Hands&quot;, intended for students in middle school or high school. It was first published in San Francisco in English, then later translated into five different languages; 70,000 copies were sold or given to medical institutions and schools. The book was considered influential in early efforts supporting public health education about the disease.

From 1987 to 1993, Saint Phalle spent more of her time in Paris, where she developed many of the smaller sculptures for the garden. From time to time, she would organize gallery shows of her art, including maquettes of her more significant works, to raise funds for the garden project. Saint Phalle also worked on establishing a permanent legal structure for the preservation and maintenance of the garden.

In 1988, Saint Phalle participated in a worldwide touring exhibition of kites. Her contribution was a gigantic kite inspired by her &quot;oiseau amoreux&quot; (&quot;amorous bird&quot;) series of sculptures.

In 1992–1993, corrective maintenance on the &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; sculptures was performed, using new glues and silicones to attach mirrors and glass elements more securely, to withstand weathering and the touch of many visitors&#x27; hands. Starting in 2021, a similar restoration process of re-attaching mirrors was ongoing with &quot;Le Cyclop&quot;, located in Milly-la-Forêt, near Paris.

The &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; was under development for almost 30 years, and $5 million (roughly $11 million in 2016 dollars) was spent to construct it. The Foundation of the Tarot Garden was constituted in 1997 (and would attain official juridical status in 2002), and the garden officially opened to the public on 15 May 1998. The completed garden (called &quot;il Giardino dei Tarocchi&quot; in Italian, and &quot;le Jardin des Tarots&quot; in French) now contains sculptures and architectural sculptures representing the 22 cards of Major Arcana found in the Tarot deck of cards, plus other smaller artworks. The site covers around on the southern slope of the hill of Garavicchio, in Capalbio. The tallest sculptures are about high.

Saint Phalle&#x27;s friend, architect Mario Botta, built a fortress-like protective wall and a porthole-shaped gateway at the entrance to the garden, marking a distinctive separation from the outside world. The entry structure also houses a ticket office, a gift shop, and restrooms for visitors. Within the park, there are fountains, courtyards, a multilevel tower, and many larger-than-life mythical creatures. Saint Phalle designed a brochure containing a map and other information for visitors to the garden, which is open seasonally.

== Later years (1990–2002) ==
In her final years, Saint Phalle was afflicted with emphysema, asthma, and severe arthritis, which she and many commentators attributed to exposure to airborne glass fibers, fumes, and petrochemicals from materials used in her artworks. Despite these handicaps, she launched into exploring new venues, new technologies, and new art media.

In 1989, Ricardo Menon, Saint Phalle&#x27;s former assistant, died of AIDS; his loss plunged Saint Phalle into depression. She created a large mosaic sculpture of a cat, &quot;Chat de Ricardo&quot;, to serve as his cemetery headstone in Montparnasse Cemetery, Paris, France. She placed a second copy of the memorial sculpture in her &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; in Tuscany, where he had worked closely with her for nearly a decade.

In 1990, Saint Phalle completed &quot;Skull (Meditation Room)&quot;, a tall room-sized skull-shaped enclosure surfaced in colorful mosaics and lined inside with mosaic mirrors, to memorialize the AIDS crisis. She also used bronze for the first time, in a series of Egyptian gods and goddesses.

In 1991, she produced a maquette for &quot;Le Temple Idéal&quot; (&quot;The Ideal Temple&quot;), a place of worship welcoming all religions, in response to the religious intolerance she saw while working in Jerusalem. The city of Nîmes (France) commissioned her to build the architectural sculpture, but the project never was constructed, due to politics. Over the years, she had become interested in myths and religious traditions beyond her childhood Roman Catholic upbringing, including Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, and ancient Egyptian beliefs.

In August 1991, Jean Tinguely died suddenly of a heart attack in Bern, Switzerland. During his previous two years of declining health, he had stopped taking medication and began preparing for death. The couple had separated years before, but remained very close; the loss of her longtime collaborator and intimate friend affected Saint Phalle deeply. She was writing a memoir letter about their first meeting when news of his death reached her.

In his memory, Saint Phalle created her first kinetic sculptures, which she called &quot;Méta-Tinguelys&quot;. With initial assistance from her artist friend Larry Rivers, she created a series of kinetic reliefs or moving paintings, called &quot;Tableaux Éclatés&quot; (&quot;Shattered Paintings&quot;), in homage to her late husband and colleague. When a visitor approached, a photocell would trigger motors which caused elements of the paintings to separate.

Saint Phalle lost many friends and associates to AIDS, including Jean-Jacques Goetzman, who died in 1992. She memorialized him with &quot;Oiseau pour Jean-Jacques&quot; (&quot;Bird for Jean-Jacques&quot;), a large reflective abstract bird sculpture at Montparnasse Cemetery.

As her health deteriorated, she worked on creating the Museum Tinguely in Basel, Switzerland, as well as continuing work on her &quot;Tarot Garden&quot;. During this time, she became a good friend of the museum&#x27;s architect Mario Botta, and she also engaged him to design the wall and entryway to her &quot;Tarot Garden&quot;.

In 1994, Saint Phalle published her hand-illustrated and hand-colored memoirs &quot;Mon Secret&quot; (&quot;My Secret&quot;) in French and revealed her childhood history of sexual abuse. In 1999, she released &quot;Traces&quot;, an English-language autobiography, which she also illustrated. In 2006, &quot;Harry and Me: The Family Years; 1950–1960&quot; was published (posthumously), consisting of her self-illustrated memoirs from the decade when she was married to Harry Mathews.

Saint Phalle moved from Paris to La Jolla, California in 1994 for health reasons. She set up a new studio and produced sculptures which were covered with mirrors, glass, and polished stones, instead of paints. In her new workspace, she started to explore novel technologies for designing and creating artwork. She also became an active member of the San Diego art scene, participating in fund-raisers and exhibitions there.

In 1994 she designed a stamp for Swiss Post, with the message &quot;Stop AIDS/Stop SIDA&quot;, for which she was awarded the Prix Caran d’Ache. She also began a series of silkscreened works, which she called &quot;California Diary&quot;, featuring local fauna. She started a new series of &quot;Totem&quot; pillars of stacked human or animal figures and anatomical fragments.

In 1994, she finally declared the collaborative sculpture &quot;Le Cyclop&quot;, started in 1969 by Tinguely and worked on by 15 artists, to be finished. The President of France, François Mitterrand, opened the work to the general public in May. To control vandalism, the installation was donated to the French state, which has taken responsibility for its safeguarding and maintenance. The massive structure is tall, weighs , and is filled with custom-built artworks, including a giant rolling ball sculpture. Many of the artworks are kinetic, endowing the installation with constant motion, and producing loud groaning and other mechanical noises.

In October 1994, the Niki Museum, dedicated to telling the story of her life and artwork, was opened in Nasu, Japan. However, the Niki Museum would later be forced to close in 2011.

In 1994, Saint Phalle worked with Peter Schamoni in making a documentary film about her life story, &quot;Niki de Saint Phalle: Wer ist das Monster – Du oder ich?&quot; (&quot;Who is the Monster, You or I?&quot;). In 1995, the film was awarded the Bavarian Film Award for best documentary.

In 1996, she began building &quot;Gila&quot;, a large dragon-shaped children&#x27;s playhouse for a San Diego private residence. This project was her first use of digital techniques to enlarge drawings into full-scale construction.

In 1996, she supported the opening of the Museum Tinguely in Basel, by donating 55 major sculptures and over 100 graphic works by Tinguely, which constituted much of the core collection. She also donated some of her and her husband&#x27;s artwork to create L’Espace Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle at the Musée d’art et d’histoire in Fribourg, Switzerland.

In 1997, she designed snake chairs of wood with a mosaic inlay, made by Del Cover and Dave Carr.

In 1998, she created a series of &quot;Black Heroes&quot; sculptures in honor of African-Americans who made major contributions to sports or jazz, including Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, and Josephine Baker. She dedicated the series to her great-grandchildren, who are of mixed race. She also completed her series of 23 large animals for the &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; sculptural park at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo with the assistance of her international team of artisans, and in collaboration with architect Mario Botta.

In 1999, she debuted a monumental statue of &quot;Buddha&quot;, a one-eyed contemplative figure seated in the lotus position. The figure is covered with glittering mosaic tiles, glass, mirrors, and polished stones.

On 17 November 2000, she became an honorary citizen of Hannover, Germany, and donated 300 pieces of her artwork to the Sprengel Museum located there. In 2000, the artist was awarded the Praemium Imperiale award for sculpture, by the Japan Art Association. The award is considered to be the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in the world of art.

In 2001, she gave 170 pieces to the Musée d&#x27;art moderne et d&#x27;art contemporain (MAMAC) in Nice, France, and donated other works to the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris.

She also designed and built for the Port of San Diego a tall, 10-ton sculpture, &quot;Coming Together&quot;. The largest of her &quot;Skinnies&quot; series, the artwork consists of a colorful half female and a black-and-white half male face joined together, covered with mosaic and stones. The dedication ceremony was delayed to 25 October 2001 because of the September 11 attacks the previous month; the artist was unable to attend because of her deteriorating health. The artwork signified her interpretation of yin and yang, sickness and health, and the integration of dual aspects into a unified whole.

Saint Phalle endured intensive care hospitalization for six months before dying of respiratory failure (caused by emphysema) at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, on 21 May 2002. She was attended by her first husband Harry Mathews, and their children.

Up until the end, she continued to design further developments for her &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; in Italy, including a maze, for which land was cleared, and metal rods were installed. Upon her death, all new developments in her garden were halted, as she had previously specified. Since then, some modest changes have been implemented, mostly to accommodate an increasing number of visitors. A garden cafe designed by Mario Botta has also been constructed. One salient exception is the Tarot figure of &quot;Le Fou&quot; (&quot;The Fool&quot;), which Saint Phalle relocated within the &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; at least twice during her life. This symbolic migrational tradition is expected to be continued from time to time.

Posthumously, the &quot;Grotto&quot; (2001–2003) was completed according to detailed instructions left by Saint Phalle. The permanent installation, in the &quot;Grosser Garten&quot;, Herrenhausen Gardens, Hannover, consisted of three rooms which were decorated on every surface with mirrors, glass, ceramics, and colored stones.

Posthumously, &quot;Queen Califia&#x27;s Magical Circle&quot; (2000–2003), a diameter sun-drenched sculpture garden designed by Saint Phalle, was opened in Escondido, California in October 2002. It is enclosed in a undulating wall topped with large python-like snakes, and includes a maze and 10 large sculptures she designed, comprising the most extensive public collection of her work in the US. The artworks were inspired by Native American culture, and decorations also included symbols and plaques referring to her earlier &quot;Tarot Garden&quot;.

==Legacy==
Throughout her career, Saint Phalle was outspoken in addressing important religious conflict, political, pandemic health, race, gender, reproductive rights, food security, climate change, and cultural issues of the time. Her &quot;Tirs&quot; series and assemblages reflected the violence of the early 1960s Algerian War for independence from France and asserted her rebellion as part of second-wave feminism. Her personal style of dress during the mid-sixties also inspired designer Yves Saint Laurent to create his &quot;le Smoking&quot; trouser suits in 1966. In spite of the spectacular use of firearms in her &quot;Tirs&quot; series of early work, she supported gun control.

Her enormous, curvaceous &quot;Nanas&quot; celebrated the fecund female form, featuring large breasts and buttocks, splayed limbs, joyous dance postures, and often, black skin. She was one of the earliest artistic champions of AIDS awareness, creating artworks and a widely distributed educational book. Shortly before her death, she exhibited drawings critical of the George W Bush administration. In addition to her artworks, she wrote extensively in both French and English, and granted numerous interviews; much of this material is collected in her archives.

Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips cited Saint Phalle&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Firebird&quot; as direct inspiration for the cover art of their hugely successful 2002 album &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot;.
