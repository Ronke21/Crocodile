<text>The green algae (: green alga) are a group of chlorophyll-containing autotrophic eukaryotes consisting of the phylum Prasinodermophyta and its unnamed sister group that contains the Chlorophyta and Charophyta/Streptophyta. The land plants (Embryophytes) have emerged deep within the charophytes as a sister of the Zygnematophyceae. Since the realization that the Embryophytes emerged within the green algae, some authors are starting to include them. The completed clade that includes both green algae and embryophytes is monophyletic and is referred to as the clade Viridiplantae and as the kingdom Plantae. The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates, most with two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid (spherical), and filamentous forms, and macroscopic, multicellular seaweeds. There are about 22,000 species of green algae, many of which live most of their lives as single cells, while other species form coenobia (colonies), long filaments, or highly differentiated macroscopic seaweeds.

A few other organisms rely on green algae to conduct photosynthesis for them. The chloroplasts in dinoflagellates of the genus &quot;Lepidodinium&quot;, euglenids and chlorarachniophytes were acquired from ingested endosymbiont green algae, and in the latter retain a nucleomorph (vestigial nucleus). Green algae are also found symbiotically in the ciliate &quot;Paramecium&quot;, and in &quot;Hydra viridissima&quot; and in flatworms. Some species of green algae, particularly of genera &quot;Trebouxia&quot; of the class &quot;Trebouxiophyceae&quot; and &quot;Trentepohlia&quot; (class Ulvophyceae), can be found in symbiotic associations with fungi to form lichens. In general the fungal species that partner in lichens cannot live on their own, while the algal species is often found living in nature without the fungus. &quot;Trentepohlia&quot; is a filamentous green alga that can live independently on humid soil, rocks or tree bark or form the photosymbiont in lichens of the family Graphidaceae. Also the macroalga &quot;Prasiola calophylla&quot; (Trebouxiophyceae) is terrestrial, and
&quot;Prasiola crispa&quot;, which live in the supralittoral zone, is terrestrial and can in the Antarctic form large carpets on humid soil, especially near bird colonies.

==Cellular structure==
Green algae have chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, giving them a bright green colour, as well as the accessory pigments beta carotene (red-orange) and xanthophylls (yellow) in stacked thylakoids. The cell walls of green algae usually contain cellulose, and they store carbohydrate in the form of starch.

All green algae have mitochondria with flat cristae. When present, paired flagella are used to move the cell. They are anchored by a cross-shaped system of microtubules and fibrous strands. Flagella are only present in the motile male gametes of charophytes bryophytes, pteridophytes, cycads and &quot;Ginkgo&quot;, but are absent from the gametes of Pinophyta and flowering plants.

Members of the class Chlorophyceae undergo closed mitosis in the most common form of cell division among the green algae, which occurs via a phycoplast. By contrast, charophyte green algae and land plants (embryophytes) undergo open mitosis without centrioles. Instead, a &#x27;raft&#x27; of microtubules, the phragmoplast, is formed from the mitotic spindle and cell division involves the use of this phragmoplast in the production of a cell plate.

==Origins==
Photosynthetic eukaryotes originated following a primary endosymbiotic event, where a heterotrophic eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthetic cyanobacterium-like prokaryote that became stably integrated and eventually evolved into a membrane-bound organelle: the plastid. This primary endosymbiosis event gave rise to three autotrophic clades with primary plastids: the (green) plants (with chloroplasts) the red algae (with rhodoplasts) and the glaucophytes (with muroplasts).

==Evolution and classification==

Green algae are often classified with their embryophyte descendants in the green plant clade Viridiplantae (or Chlorobionta). Viridiplantae, together with red algae and glaucophyte algae, form the supergroup Primoplantae, also known as Archaeplastida or Plantae &quot;sensu lato&quot;. The ancestral green alga was a unicellular flagellate.

The Viridiplantae diverged into two clades. The Chlorophyta include the early diverging prasinophyte lineages and the core Chlorophyta, which contain the majority of described species of green algae. The Streptophyta include charophytes and land plants. Below is a consensus reconstruction of green algal relationships, mainly based on molecular data.

The basal character of the Mesostigmatophyceae, Chlorokybophyceae and &quot;spirotaenia&quot; are only more conventionally basal Streptophytes.

The algae of this paraphyletic group &quot;Charophyta&quot; were previously included in Chlorophyta, so green algae and Chlorophyta in this definition were synonyms. As the green algae clades get further resolved, the embryophytes, which are a deep charophyte branch, are included in &quot;algae&quot;, &quot;green algae&quot; and &quot;Charophytes&quot;, or these terms are replaced by cladistic terminology such as Archaeplastida, Plantae/Viridiplantae, and streptophytes, respectively.

==Reproduction==

Green algae are a group of photosynthetic, eukaryotic organisms that include species with haplobiontic and diplobiontic life cycles. The diplobiontic species, such as &quot;Ulva&quot;, follow a reproductive cycle called alternation of generations in which two multicellular forms, haploid and diploid, alternate, and these may or may not be isomorphic (having the same morphology). In haplobiontic species only the haploid generation, the gametophyte is multicellular. The fertilized egg cell, the diploid zygote, undergoes meiosis, giving rise to haploid cells which will become new gametophytes. The diplobiontic forms, which evolved from haplobiontic ancestors, have both a multicellular haploid generation and a multicellular diploid generation. Here the zygote divides repeatedly by mitosis and grows into a multicellular diploid sporophyte. The sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis that germinate to produce a multicellular gametophyte. All land plants have a diplobiontic common ancestor, and diplobiontic forms have also evolved independently within Ulvophyceae more than once (as has also occurred in the red and brown algae).

Diplobiontic green algae include isomorphic and heteromorphic forms. In isomorphic algae, the morphology is identical in the haploid and diploid generations. In heteromorphic algae, the morphology and size are different in the gametophyte and sporophyte.

Reproduction varies from fusion of identical cells (isogamy) to fertilization of a large non-motile cell by a smaller motile one (oogamy). However, these traits show some variation, most notably among the basal green algae called prasinophytes.

Haploid algal cells (containing only one copy of their DNA) can fuse with other haploid cells to form diploid zygotes. When filamentous algae do this, they form bridges between cells, and leave empty cell walls behind that can be easily distinguished under the light microscope. This process is called &quot;conjugation&quot; and occurs for example in &quot;Spirogyra&quot;.

===Sex pheromone===

Sex pheromone production is likely a common feature of green algae, although only studied in detail in a few model organisms. &quot;Volvox&quot; is a genus of chlorophytes. Different species form spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells. One well-studied species, &quot;Volvox carteri&quot; (2,000 – 6,000 cells) occupies temporary pools of water that tend to dry out in the heat of late summer. As their environment dries out, asexual &quot;V. carteri&quot; quickly die. However, they are able to escape death by switching, shortly before drying is complete, to the sexual phase of their life cycle that leads to production of dormant desiccation-resistant zygotes. Sexual development is initiated by a glycoprotein pheromone (Hallmann et al., 1998). This pheromone is one of the most potent known biological effector molecules. It can trigger sexual development at concentrations as low as 10−16M. Kirk and Kirk showed that sex-inducing pheromone production can be triggered experimentally in somatic cells by heat shock. Thus heat shock may be a condition that ordinarily triggers sex-inducing pheromone in nature.

The &quot;Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale (C. psl)&quot; complex is a unicellular, isogamous charophycean alga group that is the closest unicellular relative to land plants. Heterothallic strains of different mating type can conjugate to form zygospores. Sex pheromones termed protoplast-release inducing proteins (glycopolypeptides) produced by mating-type (-) and mating-type (+) cells facilitate this process.

==Physiology==
The green algae, including the characean algae, have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the ionic and water permeability of membranes, osmoregulation, turgor regulation, salt tolerance, cytoplasmic streaming, and the generation of action potentials.

<doc id="341048" wikidata="Q57228" url="?curid=341048" title="Ferdinand Georg Frobenius">
<text>Ferdinand Georg Frobenius (26 October 1849 – 3 August 1917) was a German mathematician, best known for his contributions to the theory of elliptic functions, differential equations, number theory, and to group theory. He is known for the famous determinantal identities, known as Frobenius–Stickelberger formulae, governing elliptic functions, and for developing the theory of biquadratic forms. He was also the first to introduce the notion of rational approximations of functions (nowadays known as Padé approximants), and gave the first full proof for the Cayley–Hamilton theorem. He also lent his name to certain differential-geometric objects in modern mathematical physics, known as Frobenius manifolds.

==Biography==
Ferdinand Georg Frobenius was born on 26 October 1849 in Charlottenburg, a suburb of Berlin, from parents Christian Ferdinand Frobenius, a Protestant parson, and Christine Elizabeth Friedrich. He entered the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in 1860 when he was nearly eleven. In 1867, after graduating, he went to the University of Göttingen where he began his university studies, but he only studied there for one semester before returning to Berlin, where he attended lectures by Kronecker, Kummer and Karl Weierstrass. He received his doctorate (awarded with distinction) in 1870 supervised by Weierstrass. His thesis was on the solution of differential equations. In 1874, after having taught at secondary school level first at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium then at the Sophienrealschule, he was appointed to the University of Berlin as an extraordinary professor of mathematics. Frobenius was only in Berlin a year before he went to Zürich to take up an appointment as an ordinary professor at the Eidgenössische Polytechnikum. For seventeen years, between 1875 and 1892, Frobenius worked in Zürich. It was there that he married, brought up his family, and did much important work in widely differing areas of mathematics. In the last days of December 1891 Kronecker died and, therefore, his chair in Berlin became vacant. Weierstrass, strongly believing that Frobenius was the right person to keep Berlin in the forefront of mathematics, used his considerable influence to have Frobenius appointed. In 1893 he returned to Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.

==Contributions to group theory==
Group theory was one of Frobenius&#x27; principal interests in the second half of his career. One of his first contributions was the proof of the Sylow theorems for abstract groups. Earlier proofs had been for permutation groups. His proof of the first Sylow theorem (on the existence of Sylow groups) is one of those frequently used today.

* Frobenius also has proved the following fundamental theorem: If a positive integer &quot;n&quot; divides the order |&quot;G&quot;| of a finite group &quot;G&quot;, then the number of solutions of the equation &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 1 in &quot;G&quot; is equal to &quot;kn&quot; for some positive integer &quot;k&quot;. He also posed the following problem: If, in the above theorem, &quot;k&quot; = 1, then the solutions of the equation &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 1 in &quot;G&quot; form a subgroup. Many years ago this problem was solved for solvable groups. Only in 1991, after the classification of finite simple groups, was this problem solved in general.

More important was his creation of the theory of group characters and group representations, which are fundamental tools for studying the structure of groups. This work led to the notion of Frobenius reciprocity and the definition of what are now called Frobenius groups. A group &quot;G&quot; is said to be a Frobenius group if there is a subgroup &quot;H&quot; &lt; &quot;G&quot; such that
:formula_1 for all formula_2.

In that case, the set
:formula_3

together with the identity element of &quot;G&quot; forms a subgroup which is nilpotent as John G. Thompson showed in 1959. All known proofs of that theorem make use of characters. In his first paper about characters (1896), Frobenius constructed the character table of the group formula_4 of order (1/2)(&quot;p&quot;3 − p) for all odd primes &quot;p&quot; (this group is simple provided &quot;p&quot; &gt; 3). He also made fundamental contributions to the representation theory of the symmetric and alternating groups.

==Contributions to number theory==

Frobenius introduced a canonical way of turning primes into conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q. Specifically, if &quot;K&quot;/Q is a finite Galois extension then to each (positive) prime &quot;p&quot; which does not ramify in &quot;K&quot; and to each prime ideal &quot;P&quot; lying over &quot;p&quot; in &quot;K&quot; there is a unique element &quot;g&quot; of Gal(&quot;K&quot;/Q) satisfying the condition &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot; (mod &quot;P&quot;) for all integers &quot;x&quot; of &quot;K&quot;. Varying &quot;P&quot; over &quot;p&quot; changes &quot;g&quot; into a conjugate (and every conjugate of &quot;g&quot; occurs in this way), so the conjugacy class of &quot;g&quot; in the Galois group is canonically associated to &quot;p&quot;. This is called the Frobenius conjugacy class of &quot;p&quot; and any element of 
the conjugacy class is called a Frobenius element of &quot;p&quot;. If we take for &quot;K&quot; the &quot;m&quot;th cyclotomic field, whose Galois group over Q is the units modulo &quot;m&quot; (and thus 
is abelian, so conjugacy classes become elements), then for &quot;p&quot; not dividing &quot;m&quot; the Frobenius class in the Galois group is &quot;p&quot; mod &quot;m&quot;. From this point of view, 
the distribution of Frobenius conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q (or, more generally, Galois groups over any number field) generalizes Dirichlet&#x27;s classical result about primes in arithmetic progressions. The study of Galois groups of infinite-degree extensions of Q depends crucially on this construction of Frobenius elements, which provides in a sense a dense subset of elements which are accessible to detailed study.

<doc id="341052" wikidata="Q3840698" url="?curid=341052" title="Lungfish (band)">
<text>Lungfish is an American rock band formed in 1987 in Baltimore, Maryland. All of their music has been released by the Washington, D.C. punk label Dischord, except for their first album.

==History==
As of 2005, Lungfish&#x27;s lineup consisted of Daniel Higgs (vocals, occasional guitar), Asa Osborne (guitar), Sean Meadows (bass), and Mitchell Feldstein (drums). Two previous bass players were John Chriest and Nathan Bell.

==Related projects==
Daniel Higgs sang in the 1980s hardcore/punk band Reptile House, and has released numerous solo works under his own name and also Cone of Light. He has recently made numerous solo performances, usually with the long-necked banjo and jaw harp (his recent albums document this as well: 2006&#x27;s &quot;Ancestral Songs&quot; and 2007&#x27;s &quot;Metempsychotic Melodies&quot;). In 2011, Higgs also collaborated with Swedish band Skull Defekts on the album &quot;Peer Amid&quot; (Thrill Jockey). Since 2015, Higgs has released two full-length albums in Fountainsun, a duo with Fumie Ishii.

Asa Osborne has released a CD and 7-inch with Charles Brohawn of The Tinklers under the name Tear Jerks. Osborne also released an album on Dischord in 2002 with Daniel Higgs under the name The Pupils. In early 2008, the record label Holy Mountain announced a new solo project by Osborne called Zomes.

Sean Meadows has played in numerous bands including June of 44, The Sonora Pine, and many lesser-known bands from the Chattanooga, Tennessee music scene.

Mitchell Feldstein has published three volumes of prose/poetry: &quot;Hurl&quot; on Apathy Press, &quot;Teen Cardinal&quot; on Shattered Wig Press, and &quot;Even Change&quot; on Paradigm Publishing. He also played the drums with Arbouretum. In 2019 a cassette recording of Feldstein&#x27;s spoken word with musical backdrops, &quot;Pretty Boss&quot;, was released on Flag Day Recordings.

Nathan Bell played bass on Kogumaza&#x27;s &quot;Kолокол&quot; (2014), which featured the song &quot;Ursids&quot;, which was used as a double-A-sided single with the band Hookworms. Bell has also worked with David Heumann from Arboureteum as Human Bell.

<doc id="341054" wikidata="Q26205" url="?curid=341054" title="Yellowhammer">
<text>The yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) is a passerine bird in the bunting family that is native to Eurasia and has been introduced to New Zealand and Australia. Most European birds remain in the breeding range year-round, but the eastern subspecies is partially migratory, with much of the population wintering further south. The male yellowhammer has a bright yellow head, streaked brown back, chestnut rump, and yellow under parts. Other plumages are duller versions of the same pattern. The yellowhammer is common in open areas with some shrubs or trees, and forms small flocks in winter. Its song has a rhythm like &quot;A little bit of bread and no cheese&quot;. The song is very similar to that of its closest relative, the pine bunting, with which it interbreeds.

Breeding commences mainly in April and May, with the female building a lined cup nest in a concealed location on or near the ground. The three to five eggs are patterned with a mesh of fine dark lines, giving rise to the old name for the bird of &quot;scribble lark&quot; or &quot;writing lark&quot;. The female incubates the eggs for 12–14 days prior to hatching, and broods the altricial downy chicks until they fledge 11–13 days later. Both adults feed the chick in the nest and raise two or three broods each year. The nest may be raided by rodents or corvids, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey. Yellowhammers feed on the ground, usually in flocks outside the breeding season. Their diet is mainly seeds, supplemented by invertebrates in the breeding season. Changes to agricultural practices have led to population declines in western Europe, but its large numbers and huge range mean that the yellowhammer is classed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

This conspicuous yellow bird has inspired poems by Robert Burns and John Clare, and its characteristic song has influenced musical works by Beethoven and Messiaen. Children&#x27;s writer Enid Blyton helped to popularise the standard English representation of the song.

==Taxonomy==
The yellowhammer was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current scientific name. &quot;Emberiza&quot; is derived from the Old German &quot;Embritz&quot;, a bunting, and &quot;citrinella&quot; is the Italian for a small yellow bird. The English name is thought to have come from &quot;Ammer&quot;, another German word for a bunting, and was first recorded in 1553 as &quot;yelambre&quot;.

The bird family Emberizidae contains a single genus &quot;Emberiza&quot;, with around 40 members, that are confined to the Old World. Within its genus, the yellowhammer is most closely related to the pine bunting, with which it forms a superspecies; they have at times been considered as one species. The white-capped and cirl buntings are also near relatives of the species pair. Where their ranges meet, the yellowhammer and pine bunting interbreed; the yellowhammer is dominant, and the hybrid zone is moving further east.

===Subspecies===
There are currently 3 recognised subspecies of yellowhammer:

*&quot;E. c. citrinella&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758), the nominate subspecies, which occurs in southeast England and most of Europe east to the northwestern corner of Russia and western Ukraine.
*&quot;E. c. caliginosa&quot; (Clancey, 1940) is the form found in Ireland, the Isle of Man, and Great Britain (except southeast England).
*&quot;E. c. erythrogenys&quot; (Brehm, 1855) breeds from Russia, central Ukraine and the eastern Balkans eastwards to Siberia and northwest Mongolia, and also has isolated populations to the east of the Black Sea and in the Caucasus.

==Description==


The yellowhammer is a large bunting, long, with a wingspan; it weighs . The male of the nominate subspecies &quot;E. c. citrinella&quot; has a bright yellow head, heavily streaked brown back, rufous rump, yellow under parts, and white outer tail feathers. The female is less brightly coloured, and more streaked on the crown, breast, and flanks. Both sexes are less strongly marked outside the breeding season, when the dark fringes on new feathers obscure the yellow plumage. The juvenile is much duller and less yellow than the adults, and often has a paler rump.

After breeding, adults have a complete moult, which takes at least eight weeks; males acquire more yellow in the plumage each time they moult. Juveniles have a partial moult not long after fledging, replacing the head, body, and some covert feathers.

Differences between the subspecies are small and geographically gradual. On average, the male of &quot;E. c. caliginosa &quot; is slightly smaller and darker than the same sex of the nominate subspecies, and also has more streaking on its back, a greenish tint to the yellow of the head and more chestnut on the flanks. The male of the eastern form, &quot;E. c. erythrogenys&quot;, is paler and less streaked than &quot;E. c. citrinella&quot;. Its flanks, undertail and wing bars are usually whiter, and its crown and throat are brighter yellow. Distinguishing females of the three subspecies using plumage features is not usually possible.

Females and juveniles, especially of the pale eastern subspecies, &quot;E. c. erythrogenys&quot;, may be confused with pine buntings, but they always have a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler rufous rump, and more uniform upperparts than that species. Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine buntings are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, under parts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.

===Voice===
The song of the cock yellowhammer is a series of short notes, gradually increasing in volume and followed by one or two more protracted notes. It is often represented as &quot;A little bit of bread and no cheese&quot;, and the full version can be confused with the almost identical song of the pine bunting. If the final notes are omitted, confusion with the cirl bunting is possible. Other vocalisations include a &quot;zit&quot; contact call, a &quot;see&quot; alarm, and a trilled &quot;tirrr&quot; given in flight.

Yellowhammer males learn their songs from their fathers, and over time, regional dialects have developed, with minor differences to the conclusion of the basic song; all are mutually recognised by birds from different areas. Each male has an individual repertoire of song variants within its regional dialect; females tend to mate with males that share their dialect, and prefer those with the largest repertoires.

The pine bunting and yellowhammer are so closely related that each responds to the other&#x27;s song. The male yellowhammer&#x27;s song is more attractive to females, and is one reason for the dominance of that species where the ranges overlap.

==Distribution and habitat==

The yellowhammer breeds across the Palearctic between the July isotherms. It is the commonest and most widespread European bunting, although it is absent from high mountains, Arctic regions, the western Netherlands, most of Iberia and Greece, and low-lying regions of other countries adjoining the Mediterranean Sea. It breeds in Russia east to Irkutsk, and in most of Ukraine. The Asian range extends into northwest Turkey, the Caucasus, and northern Kazakhstan.

Most European yellowhammers winter within their breeding range, only the far north being vacated, although some birds move south of their breeding range in Spain, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries. Distances travelled can be up to for northern birds. Asian birds are more strongly migratory, deserting much of the north to winter in Iraq, Iran, and southern Central Asia. The yellowhammer has occurred as a vagrant in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Kuwait, Morocco, Malta, the Himalayas (winter vagrant from northern Afghanistan to central Nepal), the Balearic Islands, Iceland, and the Faroes.

Yellowhammers of the British and Irish race, &quot;E. c. caliginosa&quot;, were introduced to New Zealand by local acclimatisation societies in 1862, and soon spread over the main islands. They sometimes visit New Zealand&#x27;s subantarctic islands, although rarely staying to breed, and have reached Australia&#x27;s Lord Howe Island on a number of occasions. At the beginning of the 20th century, this bunting was seen as a serious agricultural pest in its adopted country.

Populations of yellowhammer have also been introduced to the Falkland Islands and South Africa.

The yellowhammer is a bird of dry, open country, preferably with a range of vegetation types and some trees from which to sing. It is absent from urban areas, forests, and wetlands. Probably originally found at forest edges and large clearing, it has benefited from traditional agriculture, which created extensive open areas with hedges and clumps of trees.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===

Breeding normally starts in early May, but often in April in the south of the range. Yellowhammers are monogamous and breed when aged one year. The males establish territories along hedges or woodland fringes and sing from a tree or bush, often continuing well into July or August. The male displays to the female by raising his wings and running towards her. The nest is built by the female on or near the ground, and is typically well hidden in tussocks, against a bank or low in a bush. It is constructed from nearby plant material, such as leaves, dry grass, and stalks, and is lined with fine grasses and sometimes animal hair. It is across with a cup deep.

The clutch is usually three to five whitish eggs, typically patterned with a network of fine, dark lines. The eggs average in size and weigh , of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs for 12–14 days to hatching, and broods the altricial, downy chicks until they fledge 11–13 days later. Both adults feed the chick in the nest and two or three broods are raised each year.

The adult annual survival rate in the UK is around 54%, and that for juveniles in their first year is 53%. The typical lifespan is three years, although records from Great Britain and Germany indicate birds surviving more than 13 years.

===Feeding===
Foraging is mainly on the ground, and the bird&#x27;s diet consists mainly of seeds. Oily seeds, such as those of brassicas, are ignored in favour of more starchy items. Typical food plants include common nettle, docks, common knotgrass, fat hen, common chickweed, and yarrow. Grasses are also important, particularly cereals, and grain makes up a significant part of the food consumed in autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley. When not breeding, yellowhammers forage in flocks that can occasionally number hundreds of birds, and often contain other buntings and finches.

The yellowhammer adds invertebrates to its diet in the breeding season, particularly as food for its growing chicks. A wide range of species is taken, including springtails, grasshoppers, flies, beetles, caterpillars, earthworms, spiders, and snails. During the first few days, chicks are exclusively fed invertebrate prey, but from day three they are also fed cereal grains, which the chicks can digest efficiently. This is thought to be intentional by the parents to allow the nestlings to adjust their physiology to eating seed.

==Predators and parasites==

Predators of the yellowhammer include the sparrowhawk, northern goshawk, lesser spotted eagle, and hobby. It is not a significant host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite, although as a ground-nesting bird, its eggs and chicks are vulnerable to predation from small mammals such as mice and other rodents. Nests are also raided by crows, Eurasian jays, and Eurasian magpies. Predation accounted for more than 60% of nest failures in a 2012 survey in Germany.

Thirteen species of fleas in the genera &quot;Ceratophyllus&quot; and &quot;Dasypsyllus&quot; have been found on this bunting, and internal parasites include &quot;Ascaridia galli&quot;. The yellowhammer may carry haematozoan blood parasites such as &quot;Haemoproteus coatneyi&quot;. Males with high parasite levels produced fewer offspring (there is no such effect for females), and tend to be less brightly coloured. The striking plumage of the male may therefore have arisen as a signal of fitness to breed. Yellowhammers infected with &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; may have lower winter survival rates due to a tendency to having shorter wings.

==Status and conservation==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates the European population of the yellowhammer to be from 54–93 million individuals, suggesting a Eurasian total of 73–186 million birds. Although the population appears to be in a decline, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger their vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and huge breeding range of about 12.9 million km2 (5 million sq mi), mean that this bunting is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.

Populations have declined in recent decades in western Europe, including the British Isles, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, and Italy. The yellowhammer is a red-list (severely declining) species in Ireland and the UK. In 2016 the species went extinct on the Isle of Man. In eastern Europe, numbers appear to be stable, although the trend in Russia is unknown. Changes to agricultural practices are thought to be responsible for reduced breeding densities. The introduced population in New Zealand has been very successful, with breeding densities much higher than in the UK.

==In culture==

The yellowhammer is a conspicuous, vocal, and formerly common country bird, and has attracted human interest. Yellowham Wood and Yellowham Hill, near Dorchester England, both derive their names from the bird. Robbie Burns&#x27; poem &quot;The Yellow, Yellow Yorlin&#x27;&quot; gets its title from a Scottish name for the yellowhammer, which is given an obvious sexual connotation: &quot;I met a pretty maid, an&#x27; unto her I said,/ &#x27;I wad fain fin&#x27; your yellow, yellow yorlin&#x27;.&#x27; &quot; More factual descriptions of the bird and its behaviour can be found in John Clare&#x27;s &quot;The Yellowhammer&#x27;s Nest&quot; and &quot;The Yellowhammer&quot;, whose final lines read:
&lt;poem&gt;
In early spring, when winds blow chilly cold,
The yellowhammer, trailing grass, will come
To fix a place and choose an early home,
With yellow breast and head of solid gold.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Enid Blyton helped to popularize the bird&#x27;s song as &quot;little bit of bread and no cheese&quot; in books such as &quot;The Ship of Adventure&quot; and &quot;Five Go Off in a Caravan&quot;, and wrote a poem called &quot;The Yellow-hammer&quot;.

Beethoven&#x27;s student, Carl Czerny, and biographer Anton Schindler, both suggested that the composer got the idea for the first four notes of his 5th symphony from the yellowhammer&#x27;s call, although more likely the opening of the 4th Piano Concerto was actually the work in question. Beethoven also used the yellowhammer theme in two piano sonatas, no. 21 in C major (the &quot;Waldstein&quot;, Op.53) and No. 23 in F minor (the &quot;Appassionata&quot;, Op.57).

Olivier Messiaen often used birdsong as an inspiration for his music, and the yellowhammer features in &quot;Chronochromie&quot;, &quot;Catalogue d&#x27;oiseaux&quot;, &quot;La fauvette des jardins&quot; and &quot;Méditations sur le mystère de la Sainte Trinité&quot;, appearing in four movements of the last piece.

An old legend links the yellowhammer to the devil. Its tongue was supposed to bear a drop of his blood, and the intricate pattern on the eggs was said to carry a concealed, possibly evil, message; these satanic associations sometimes led to the persecution of the bird. The unusual appearance of the eggs also led to the alternative names of scribble lark or scribble jack.

<text>The Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi), also known as the Ryukyu rabbit is a dark-furred species of rabbit which is found only on Amami Ōshima and Tokunoshima, two small islands between southern Kyūshū and Okinawa in Japan. Often called a living fossil, the Amami rabbit is a living remnant of ancient rabbits that once lived on the Asian mainland, where they died out, remaining only on the two small Japanese islands where they live today.

== Evolution ==
&quot;Pentalagus&quot; is thought to be a descendant of &quot;Pliopentalagus,&quot; known from the Pliocene of China and Eastern to Central Europe. It is also closely related to the North American genus &quot;Aztlanolagus&quot; (which may be synonynous with &quot;Pliopentalagus&quot;), which became extinct sometime after 30,000 years ago. The closest living relative of the Amami rabbit has been suggested to be the Central African Bunyoro rabbit (&quot;Poelagus&quot; &quot;marjorita&quot;). Uniquely among rabbits, it has 46 diploid chromosomes.

== Etymology ==
The generic name &quot;Pentalagus&quot;, as described by Marcus Ward Lyon Jr., refers to the presence of five molars on each side of the Amami rabbit&#x27;s teeth, differing from each other extant then-known rabbit genera in that it lacks a third upper molar. The specific name &quot;furnessi&quot; refers to the original discoverer of the Amami rabbit, William Henry Furness III.

==Biology==
===Diet===
The Amami rabbit feeds on over 29 species of plants, which incorporates 17 species of shrubs and 12 species of herbaceous plants, consuming mostly the sprouts, young shoots and acorns. It also eats nuts and cambium of a wide variety of plant species. It is observed that the Amami rabbit also feeds on the bark of stems and twigs of shrub plants. During summer, the Amami rabbit primarily feeds on Japanese pampas grass, and during winter, they primarily eat the acorns of the pasania tree. The Amami rabbit also eats the fruits of &quot;Balanophora yuwanensis&quot;, a parasitic flowering plant, for which they are the main distributors of seed.

===Morphology===
The Amami rabbit has short feet and hind legs, a somewhat bulky body, and rather large and curved claws used for digging and sometimes climbing. Its ears are significantly smaller compared to those of other hares or rabbits. The pelage is thick, wooly and dark, brown on top and becomes more reddish-brown on the sides. It has heavy, long and very strong claws, being nearly straight on the forefeet and curved on the hindfeet The eyes are also small compared to more common rabbits and hares. The average weight is 2.5–2.8 kg.

===Distribution and habitat===
The ideal habitat for these rabbits is in an area between mature and young forests. They use the dense mature forests as protection and for the presence of pampas grass, in the summer, and acorns, in the winter, for their diets. They also use the high density of perennial grasses and herbaceous ground cover in the young forests for their diets during different times of the year. Therefore, the best habitat for them to live in is where they have easy access to both young and mature forests with no obstructions between the two forest types.

Using fecal pellet counts and resident surveys, the number of rabbits is estimated at 2000–4800 left on Amami Island and 120–300 left on Tokuno Island.

===Behavior===
This species is a nocturnal forest-dweller that reproduces once in late March–May and once in September–December, having one or two young each time. During the day, the mother digs a hole in the ground, for her young to hide in. At night, she opens the entrance to the hole, while watching for predators (such as venomous snakes), and then nurses her young, after which she closes the hole with soil and plant material by thumping on it with her front paws. Amami rabbits sleep during the day in hidden locations, such as caves. They are also noted for having a call similar to that of a pika.

==Endangered species==
===Threats===
Before 1921, hunting and trapping were another cause of decline in population numbers. In 1921, Japan declared the Amami rabbit a &quot;natural monument&quot; which prevented it from being hunted. Then in 1963, it was changed to a &quot;special natural monument&quot; which prevented it from being trapped as well.

Habitat destruction, such as forest clearing for commercial logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, is the most detrimental activity on the distribution of these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove the current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.

The Amami rabbit also faces huge threats from the invasive predators, being a major cause for the decline in population size. On the island of Amami, the small Indian mongoose (&quot;Urva auropunctata&quot;) was released to control the population of a local venomous snake, and its numbers have increased dramatically. This mongoose, along with feral cats and dogs, are outpreying the Amami rabbit. Feral cats and small Indian Mongooses proved to be a threat to not only Amami rabbits but several other endangered endemic species in the area such as the Amami jay.

===Conservation===
In July 2008, the Amami Rangers for nature conservation obtained a photograph of a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Guntō National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased.

Suggested conservation work for the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control, as a healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on the southern end of Amami. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the Amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.

The Lagomorph Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources proposed a plan of conservation in 1990. In Amami-Oshima Island, the Amami Wildlife Conservation Center of the Ministry of the Environment was established in 1999. It designated the Amami rabbit as endangered in 2004 for Japan and restarted a mongoose eradication program in 2005.

<doc id="341070" wikidata="Q923876" url="?curid=341070" title="100 Miles and Runnin'">
<text>100 Miles and Runnin is the only EP from the American gangsta rap group N.W.A. Released on August 14, 1990, this EP of five tracks reflects an evolution of N.W.A&#x27;s sound and centers on the single &quot;100 Miles and Runnin&#x27;. Two tracks, &quot;100 Miles&quot; and &quot;Real Niggaz&quot;, incidentally incited N.W.A&#x27;s feud with Ice Cube, who had left to start a solo rap career. The porno rap track &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Bite It&quot; also drew notice. Pushing lyrical boundaries in its day, the EP went gold in November 1990 and platinum in September 1992.

==Backstory==
Whereas the EP&#x27;s track &quot;Sa Prize, Pt. 2&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;—the most controversial track on N.W.A&#x27;s official debut album, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;—&quot;100 Miles and Runnin&#x27;, rather, became N.W.A&#x27;s first single to see national radio play, and its music video see national television airtime. It is the first N.W.A. project without Ice Cube and Arabian Prince. The EP attained gold sales, over 500,000 copies sold, by November 16, 1990, and on September 16, 1992, was certified platinum, over 1million sold.

===Cube&#x27;s departure===
In 1989, N.W.A member Dr. Dre, its label Ruthless Records&#x27; prime record producer, did all tracks on Ruthless rapper The D.O.C.&#x27;s album. By May 1991, feeling underpaid, Dre left Ruthless. But still in 1989, Ice Cube, a prime rapper and ghostwriter in N.W.A, who had been paid about $32,000 so far, asked group leader Eazy-E for a meeting on money allocation. N.W.A&#x27;s manager Jerry Heller, Eazy&#x27;s business partner, led the meeting.

At Cube&#x27;s concerns, Heller offered N.W.A&#x27;s five members—Eazy, Dre, Cube, DJ Yella, and MC Ren—a contract nearly unchanged, but a $75,000 signing bonus. Only Cube refused to sign it. By 1990, he had left the group and its label. In May 1990, Cube&#x27;s debut solo album arrived as &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, which &quot;Spin&quot; magazine called a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and &quot;The Source&quot; magazine gave a full five &quot;microphones&quot;. N.W.A&#x27;s EP, written by Ren and The D.O.C., has two tracks smearing Cube.

===Feud with Cube===
In the EP&#x27;s title track, alluding to Ice Cube, Dre raps, &quot;It started with five, but yo, one couldn&#x27;t take it / So now there&#x27;s four, &#x27;cause the fifth couldn&#x27;t make it.&quot; And in &quot;Real Niggaz&quot;, soon after Ren raps, &quot;Only reason niggas pick up your record is &#x27;cause they thought it was us&quot;, Dre calls Cube both &quot;too much cargo&quot; and the proverbial traitor Benedict Arnold.

Hosting rap TV show &quot;Pump It Up!&quot;, Dee Barnes interviewed N.W.A, promoting the EP. Later, the show&#x27;s producers sent Barnes to get Cube&#x27;s rebuttal. Against Barnes&#x27;s warning, the November 1990 episode splices interview clips to magnify the conflict. In January, drunk at a Ruthless party in Hollywood, Dre assaulted Barnes, reputedly in payback.

Released in May 1991, N.W.A&#x27;s next album, &quot;EFil4zaggin&quot; or &quot;Niggaz4Life&quot;, furthered the feud in two more tracks: &quot;Message to B.A.&quot; and, in a few lines, the hit single &quot;Alwayz into Somethin&#x27;. Cube&#x27;s second album, &quot;Death Certificate&quot;, released in October, retorts in &quot;No Vaseline&quot;, depicting N.W.A as sellouts screwed by Jerry Heller. Cube thus won the battle, ending there.

===EP highlights===
The &quot;100 Miles&quot; EP previewed N.W.A&#x27;s evolving sound, spare on &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, and now more layered, as in the &quot;100 Miles&quot; track. This song&#x27;s idea was from a film among Eazy&#x27;s favorites, director Walter Hill&#x27;s 1979 gangster film &quot;The Warriors&quot;. On the other hand, the track &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Bite It&quot;, says AllMusic, &quot;is an alarming porno rap that at the time of its release was as explicit as anything out there, including 2 Live Crew.&quot;

From the &quot;100 Miles&quot; EP, three songs— &quot;100 Miles and Runnin&quot;, &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Bite It&quot;, and &quot;Real Niggaz&quot;—would be collected on &quot;N.W.A&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. &quot;Real Niggaz&quot; appears, too, on N.W.A&#x27;s second and final official, studio album, &quot;Efil4zaggin&quot;, the backwards spelling of &quot;Niggaz4Life&quot;. On it, &quot;She Swallowed It&quot; as well as &quot;Findum, Fuckum &amp; Flee&quot;—ahead of dozens of other rap songs in later years—sample &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Bite It&quot;, as does the punk ska band Sublime&#x27;s song &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Get Stoned&quot;. Arriving in 2003, a remastered edition of &quot;Efil4zaggin&quot; fully appends the &quot;100 Miles&quot; EP.

<text>Diana Vreeland (September 29, 1903 – August 22, 1989) was an American fashion columnist and editor. She worked for the fashion magazine &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and as editor-in-chief at &quot;Vogue&quot;, later becoming a special consultant to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was named on the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1964. Vreeland coined the term &quot;&quot; in 1965.

==Early life==
Born Diana Dalziel in Paris in 1903, she lived at 5 avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne (known as Avenue Foch post-World War I). Vreeland was the eldest daughter of an American socialite mother, Emily Key Hoffman, and a British stockbroker father, Frederick Young Dalziel. Hoffman was a descendant of George Washington&#x27;s brother, as well as a cousin of Francis Scott Key. She was also a distant cousin of writer and socialite Pauline de Rothschild (née Potter). Vreeland had one sister, Alexandra, who later married Sir Alexander Davenport Kinloch, 12th Baronet (1902–1982). Their daughter Emily Lucy Kinloch married Lt.-Col. Hon. Hugh Waldorf Astor (1920–1999), the second son of John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever and Violet Astor, Baroness Astor of Hever.

Vreeland&#x27;s family emigrated to the United States at the outbreak of World War I, moving to 15 East 77th Street in the Upper East Side, Manhattan area of New York City, where they became prominent society figures. Vreeland was sent to dancing school as a pupil of Michel Fokine, the only Imperial Ballet master ever to leave Russia, and later of Louis Harvy Chalif. She performed in Anna Pavlova&#x27;s Gavotte at Carnegie Hall. In January 1922, she was featured in the pages of her future magazine, &quot;Vogue&quot;, in a roundup of socialites and their cars. The story read, &quot;Such motors as these accelerate the social whirl. Miss Diana Dalziel, one of the most attractive debutantes of the winter, is shown entering her Cadillac.&quot;

On March 1, 1924, Diana Dalziel married Thomas Reed Vreeland (1899–1966), a banker and international financier, at St. Thomas Church in New York. The couple had two sons: Tim (Thomas Reed Vreeland, Jr.) born 1925, who became an architect, as well as a professor of architecture at the University of New Mexico and then UCLA, and Frecky (Frederick Dalziel Vreeland), born 1927, who would become U.S. ambassador to Morocco. A week before Diana&#x27;s wedding, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that her mother had been named co‑respondent in the divorce proceedings of Sir Charles Ross and his second wife, Patricia. The ensuing scandal estranged Vreeland from her mother, who died in September 1927 in Nantucket, Massachusetts.

After the Vreelands&#x27; honeymoon, they moved to Brewster, New York, where they raised their two sons and remained until 1929, when they relocated to 17 Hanover Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, London, previously the home of Wilkie Collins and Edmund Gosse. In London, she danced with the Tiller Girls and met Cecil Beaton, who became a lifelong friend. Like Syrie Maugham and Elsie de Wolfe, society women who ran their own boutiques, Diana operated a lingerie business near Berkeley Square. Her clients included Wallis Simpson and Mona Williams. She often visited Paris, where she would buy her clothes, mostly from Chanel, whom she had met in 1926. She was one of fifteen American women presented to King George V and Queen Mary at Buckingham Palace on May 18, 1933. In 1935, her husband&#x27;s job brought them back to New York, where they lived for the remainder of their lives.

As Vreeland would later recall, &quot;Before I went to work for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar,&quot; in 1936, I had been leading a wonderful life in Europe. That meant traveling, seeing beautiful places, having marvelous summers, studying and reading a great deal of the time.&quot;

A biographical documentary of Vreeland, &quot;The Eye has to Travel&quot;, debuted in September 2012 at the Angelika Theater in New York City.

==Career==

===&quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; 1936–1962===
Vreeland began her publishing career in 1936 as columnist for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. Harper&#x27;s Bazaar is a fashion magazine that women of every age can use as a style resource. It covers what&#x27;s new to what&#x27;s next on the work of stylists, photographers, and designers. Its editor, Carmel Snow, had been so impressed with Vreeland&#x27;s style and attire that she asked her to work at the magazine. From 1936 until her resignation, Diana Vreeland ran a column for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; called &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You...?,&quot;full of random, imaginative suggestions. For example, she wrote, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you...Turn your child into an Infanta for a fancy-dress party?&quot; According to Vreeland, &quot;The one that seemed to draw the most attention was [...] &quot;[Why Don&#x27;t You] [w]ash your blond child&#x27;s hair in dead champagne, as they do in France?&quot; Vreeland says that S. J. Perelman&#x27;s subsequent parody of it for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine outraged her then-editor, Carmel Snow.

Vreeland &quot;discovered&quot; the then-unknown Lauren Bacall during World War II. The &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; cover for March 1943 shows the newly minted model (not yet a Hollywood star) Lauren Bacall, posing near a Red Cross office. Vreeland directed the shoot, later describing the image as &quot;an extraordinary photograph, in which Bacall is leaning against the outside door of a Red Cross blood donor room. She wears a chic suit, gloves, a cloche hat with long waves of hair falling from it&quot;. Ever focused on fashion, Vreeland commented in 1946 that &quot;[T]he bikini is the most important thing since the atom bomb&quot;. Disdainful of the typical approach to dressing in the United States in the 1940s, she detested &quot;strappy high-heel shoes&quot; and the &quot;crêpe de chine dresses&quot; that women wore even in the heat of the summer in the countryside.

Until her resignation from &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, she worked closely with Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Richard Avedon, Nancy White, and Alexey Brodovitch. She became the magazine&#x27;s Fashion Editor. Richard Avedon recalled when he first met her, at &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, she &quot;looked up at me for the first time and said, &#x27;Aberdeen, Aberdeen, doesn&#x27;t it make you want to cry?&#x27; Well, it did. I went back to Carmel Snow and said, &#x27;I can&#x27;t work with that woman. She calls me Aberdeen.&#x27; Carmel Snow said, &#x27;You&#x27;re going to work with her.&#x27; And I did, to my enormous benefit, for almost 40 years.&quot; Avedon said at the time of her death that &quot;she was and remains the only genius fashion editor&quot;.

In 1955, the Vreelands moved to a new apartment, which Diana had Billy Baldwin decorate entirely in red. She said, &quot;I want this place to look like a garden, but a garden in hell&quot;. Regular attendees at the parties the Vreelands threw were socialite C. Z. Guest, composer Cole Porter, and British photographer Cecil Beaton. Paramount&#x27;s 1957 movie musical &quot;Funny Face&quot; featured a character—Maggie Prescott as portrayed by Kay Thompson—based on Vreeland.

In 1960, John F. Kennedy became president and Vreeland advised First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in matters of style. &quot;Vreeland advised Jackie throughout the campaign and helped connect her with fashion designer Oleg Cassini, who became chief designer to the first lady&quot;. &quot;I can remember Jackie Kennedy, right after she moved into the White House...It wasn&#x27;t even like a country club, if you see what I mean--&quot;plain&quot;.&quot; Vreeland occasionally gave Mrs. Kennedy advice about clothing during her husband&#x27;s administration, and small advice about what to wear on Inauguration Day in 1961.

In spite of being extremely successful, Diana Vreeland was paid a relatively small salary by the Hearst Corporation, which owned &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. Vreeland said that she was paid $18,000 a year from 1936 with a $1,000 raise, finally, in 1959. She speculated that newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s castle in San Simeon, California, &quot;must have been where the Hearst money went&quot;.

===&quot;Vogue&quot; 1962–1971 ===
According to some sources, hurt that she was passed over for promotion at &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in 1957, she joined &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1962. She was editor-in-chief from 1963 until 1971. Vreeland enjoyed the 1960s enormously because she felt that uniqueness was being celebrated. &quot;If you had a bump on your nose, it made no difference so long as you had a marvelous body and good carriage.&quot;

In December 1962 Rudi Gernreich first conceived of a topless swimsuit, but he didn&#x27;t intend to produce the design commercially. It had more meaning to Gernreich as an idea than as a reality. Gernreich had Peggy Moffitt model the suit in person for Vreeland, who asked him why he conceived of the design. Gernreich told her he felt it was time for &quot;freedom—in fashion as well as every other facet of life,&quot; but that the swimsuit was just a statement. &quot;[Women] drop their bikini tops already,&quot; he said, &quot;so it seemed like the natural next step.&quot; She told him, &quot;If there&#x27;s a picture of it, it&#x27;s an actuality. You must make it.&quot; Gernreich did, and he decided to call his design a monokini.

Vreeland sent memos to her staff urging them to be creative. One said, &quot;Today let&#x27;s think pig white! Wouldn&#x27;t it be wonderful to have stockings that were pig white! The color of baby pigs, not quite white and not quite pink!&quot; During her tenure at the magazine, she discovered the sixties &quot;youthquake&quot; star Edie Sedgwick. In 1984, Vreeland explained how she saw fashion magazines. &quot;What these magazines gave was a point of view. Most people haven&#x27;t got a point of view; they need to have it given to them—and what&#x27;s more, they expect it from you. [...][I]t must have been 1966 or &#x27;67. I published this big fashion slogan: This is the year of do it yourself. [...][E]very store in the country telephoned to say, &#x27;Look, you have to tell people. No one wants to do it themselves—they want direction and to follow a leader!&#x27;&quot;

She notoriously went over budget each issue. However, she was not someone known to compromise. If she was going to be editor-in-chief at Vogue, she would not skimp on her ideas no matter the cost, man-power, or obscurity. Then in 1971, like a large wooden door swinging closed, silencing a steady wind, Vreeland was let go from her position as editor-chief of Vogue. She was chronically over-budget and, though good-natured, a tyrant in the office.

=== The Metropolitan Museum of Art===
After she was fired from &quot;Vogue&quot;, she became consultant to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1971. By 1984, according to Vreeland&#x27;s account, she had organized twelve exhibitions. Artist Greer Lankton created a life-size portrait doll of Vreeland that is on display in the Costume Institute&#x27;s library.

==Later years==
In 1984, Vreeland wrote her autobiography, &quot;D.V.&quot;

In 1989, she died of a heart attack at age 85 at Lenox Hill Hospital, on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side in New York City.

==Diana Vreeland Estate==
The Diana Vreeland Estate is administered by her grandson, Alexander Vreeland, Frederick&#x27;s son. The responsibility was given to him by her sons, Fredrick and Tim. The official Diana Vreeland website was launched in September 2011. Created and overseen by her estate, DianaVreeland.com is dedicated to her work and career, presenting her accomplishments and influence, and revealing how and why she achieved her and distinction.

==Film portrayals==
Vreeland was portrayed in the film &quot;Infamous&quot; (2006) by Juliet Stevenson. She was also portrayed in the film &quot;Factory Girl&quot; (2006) by Illeana Douglas. Her life was documented in &quot;Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel&quot; (2011).

Diana Vreeland Parfums is featured in the opening scene of &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot;.

==References in media and pop culture==
In the 2023 documentary film, &quot;Donyale Luna: Supermodel&quot;, Vreeland features in a letter from Richard Avendon&#x27;s personal archives about an exchange had where Vreeland rejects Avendon&#x27;s photographs of Donyale Luna and compares the black supermodel to King Kong.

In the 1941 musical &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; by Moss Hart, Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin the character of Alison Du Bois was based on Vreeland.

Maggie Prescott, a fashion magazine editor in &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957) is loosely based on Diana Vreeland.

In the 1966 film &quot;Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?&quot;, Miss Maxwell (Grayson Hall) portrays an extravagant American expatriate fashion magazine editor. The film&#x27;s director, William Klein, worked briefly for Vreeland and has confirmed the outrageous character in Polly Maggoo was based on Vreeland.

In 1980, she was lauded in an article about social climbing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

In 1982, she met over dinner with author Bruce Chatwin, who wrote a touching memoir of their dinner conversation in a half-page slice-of-life, entitled &quot;At Dinner with Diana Vreeland&quot;.

In the 1995 film &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot;, Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze) gives a copy of Vreeland&#x27;s autobiography to a thrift-store clerk and tells him to &quot;commit sections to memory&quot;. Later, the clerk quotes a passage that reads &quot;That season we were loaded with pizazz. Earrings of fuchsia and peach. Mind you, peach. And hats. Hats, hats, hats, for career girls. How I adored Paris.&quot;

In October 1996, Mary Louise Wilson portrayed Vreeland in a one-woman play called &quot;Full Gallop&quot;, which she had written together with Mark Hampton. The play takes place the day after Vreeland&#x27;s return to New York City from her 4-month escape to Paris after being fired from &quot;Vogue.&quot; It was produced at the Westside Theatre in New York City, and directed by Nicholas Martin. Full Gallop ran at the Hampstead Theatre, London during September 2008, with Diana Vreeland again played by Mary Louise Wilson.

In the 2011 book &quot;Damned&quot; by Chuck Palahniuk, the main character (Madison Spencer) receives a pair of high heels from the character Babette.
&quot;In one hand, Babette holds a strappy pair of high heels. She says, &quot;I got these from Diana Vreeland. I hope they fit...&quot;.

Diana Vreeland has been impersonated twice as part of the Snatch Game challenge in &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, by Robbie Turner in Season 8, and by Raja Gemini in Season 7 of &quot;All Stars&quot;.

<doc id="341074" wikidata="Q2414362" url="?curid=341074" title="T-tail">
<text>A T-tail is an empennage in which the tailplane of an aircraft is mounted to the top of the fin. The arrangement looks like the capital letter T, hence the name. The T-tail differs from the standard configuration in which the tailplane is mounted to the fuselage at the base of the fin.

==Advantages==

T-tails were common in early jet aircraft. Designers were worried that an engine failure would otherwise damage the horizontal tail.

The T-tail is very common on aircraft with engines mounted in nacelles on a high-winged aircraft or on aircraft with the engines mounted on the rear of the fuselage, as it keeps the tail clear of the jet exhaust. Rear-mounting the engines keeps the wings clean and improves short-field performance. This was necessary in early jet aircraft with less powerful engines.

T-tail aircraft can have better short-field performance, such as on the Avro RJ-85. The disturbed airflow over a lower stabilizer can make control more difficult at lower speeds.

During normal flying conditions, the tailplane of a T-tail is out of the disturbed airflow behind the wing and fuselage, which provides for more consistent elevator response.

The design and structure of a T-tail can be simpler.

For a transsonic aircraft a T-tail configuration may improve pitch control effectiveness, because the elevator is not in disturbed air behind the fuselage, particularly at moderate angles of attack.

Depending on wing location, the elevator may remain in undisturbed airflow during a stall. (However, T-tail aircraft may be vulnerable to deep stall, see Disadvantages below.)

An aircraft with a T-tail may be easier to recover from a spin, as the elevator is not in a position to block airflow over the rudder, which would make it ineffective, as can happen if the horizontal tail is directly below the fin and rudder.

The T-tail increases the effectiveness of the vertical tail because of &quot;end plate&quot; effect. The horizontal stabilizer acts like a winglet, reducing induced drag of the rudder. Smaller and lighter T-tails are often used on modern gliders.

When the vertical tail is swept, the horizontal tail can be made smaller because it is further rearwards and therefore has a greater lever arm. Tail sweep may be necessary at high Mach numbers.

A T-tail may have less interference drag, such as on the Tupolev Tu-154.

T-tails may be used to increase clearance at the rear of a cargo aircraft such as the Boeing C-17 Globemaster, to provide extra clearance when loading the aircraft.

==Disadvantages==
The aircraft may be prone to deep stall (or super stall) at high angles of attack, when airflow over the tailplane and elevators is blanked by the wings. The American McDonnell F-101 Voodoo jet fighter suffered from this problem, as did the British Gloster Javelin, Hawker Siddeley Trident and BAC One-Eleven. A stick-pusher can be fitted to deal with this problem.

For propeller aircraft, a T-tail configuration may reduce pitch control effectiveness if the elevators are outside the propeller slipstream.

The vertical stabilizer must be made stronger (and therefore heavier) to support the weight of the tailplane. (However other factors may make the T-tail smaller and lighter, see Advantages above.)

A T-tail produces a strong nose-down pitching moment in sideslip.

T-tails can cause aeroelastic flutter, as seen on the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. The fuselage must be made stiffer to counteract this.

Many large aircraft can have the fin and rudder fold to reduce height in hangars, however this generally isn&#x27;t feasible or useful if there is a T-tail.

The T-tail configuration can also cause maintenance problems. The control runs to the elevators are more complex, and the surfaces are more difficult to inspect from the ground. The loss of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was attributed to improper maintenance of the T-tail. T-tails can be harder to inspect or maintain, due to their height.

==Adoption==

The T-tail can often be found on military transport aircraft, such as the Airbus A400M, the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III and the Embraer C-390 Millenium. It was used in the 1950s by combat aircraft such as the Gloster Javelin, McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, and Lockheed F-104 Starfighter interceptors, and on the Blackburn Buccaneer attack aircraft.

T-tails are often used on regional airliners and business aircraft, especially when rear-fuselage-mounted turbofan engines are used. 

In the 1960s, T-tails were used on the BAC One-Eleven, Vickers VC10, McDonnell Douglas DC-9, Boeing 727, Fokker F28 Fellowship, Ilyushin Il-62 and Tupolev Tu-154. It has been used by the Gulfstream family since the Grumman Gulfstream II. It has been used by the Learjet family since their first aircraft, the Learjet 23. It has also been used by the Embraer&#x27;s Phenom 100, Phenom 300 and Legacy/Praetor business jet families. 

In the 1970s it was used on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and Ilyushin Il-76, as well as the twin turboprop Beechcraft Super King Air. In the 1980s it was used on the Fokker 100 and the British Aerospace 146.

In the 1990s it was used on the Boeing 717, Bombardier CRJ-Series, Embraer ERJ family, Fokker 70 and McDonnell Douglas MD-90, as well as the single turboprop Pilatus PC-12.

T-tail is especially popular on modern gliders because of the high performance, the safety it provides from accidental spins, and the safety it provides the stabilizer and elevator from foreign object damage on take-off and landing.

<doc id="341075" wikidata="Q681596" url="?curid=341075" title="Gyros">
<text>Gyros, sometimes anglicized as a gyro (; , ) in some regions, is meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie, then sliced and served wrapped or stuffed in pita bread, along with other ingredients such as tomato, onion, fried potatoes, and tzatziki. In Greece, it is normally made with pork or sometimes with chicken, whilst beef and lamb are also used in other countries.

==Name==
The name comes from the Greek (, &#x27;circle&#x27; or &#x27;turn&#x27;). It is a calque of the Turkish , from , also meaning &quot;turn&quot;. 

In Greek, &quot;gyros&quot; is a nominative singular noun, but the final &#x27;s&#x27; is often interpreted in English usage as plural, leading to the singular back-formation &quot;gyro&quot;. The standard Greek and English pronunciation is . Some English speakers pronounce it , likely because the word is a heteronym of the, only indirectly related, word &quot;&quot;.

In Athens and other parts of southern Greece, the skewered meat dish elsewhere called &quot;souvlaki&quot; is known as &quot;kalamaki&quot;, while &quot;souvlaki&quot; is a term used generally for gyros, and similar dishes. In other regions, for example in Thessaloniki, gyros only refers to the meat on the spit, and what English speakers refer to as a &quot;gyros wrap&quot; is called a &quot;sandwich&quot; (&quot;σάντουιτς&quot;). 

===Similar dishes===
Gyros is made in a similar manner to other dishes such as the Arab shawarma, Canadian donair, Mexican al pastor, and the Turkish döner kebab.

==History==

Grilling a vertical spit of stacked meat and slicing it off as it cooks was developed in Bursa in the 19th century in the Ottoman Empire. After the 1922-23 population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the Greeks brought their variation with them to Greece. Following World War II, gyros made with lamb (called shawarma) was present in Athens. It was likely introduced by immigrants from Anatolia and the Middle East. The Greek version is normally made with pork and served with tzatziki, and became known as gyros.

By 1970, gyros wraps were already a popular fast food in Athens, as well as in Chicago and New York City. At that time, although vertical rotisseries were starting to be mass-produced in the US by Gyros Inc. of Chicago, the stacks of meat were still hand-made. There are several claimants to have introduced the first mass-produced gyros to the United States, all based in the Chicago area in the early 1970s, and of Greek descent. One of them, Peter Parthenis, has said that the mass-produced gyro was first conceptualized by John and Margaret Garlic; John Garlic was a Jewish car salesman who later ran a restaurant featuring live dolphins.

The Halifax donair in Canada which was based on the Greek gyros was invented in the 1970s by Peter Gamoulakos. Originally from Greece, he started selling Greek gyros (a pita stuffed with grilled lamb and tzatziki) from his restaurant located off the Bedford Highway.

==Preparation==

In Greece, gyros is normally made with pork, though other meats are used in other countries. Chicken is common, and lamb or beef may be found more rarely. Typical American mass-produced gyros are made with finely ground beef mixed with lamb.

For hand-made gyros, meat is cut into approximately round, thin, flat slices, which are then stacked on a spit and seasoned. Fat trimmings are usually interspersed. Spices may include cumin, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and others. The pieces of meat, in the shape of an inverted cone, are placed on a tall vertical rotisserie, which turns slowly in front of a source of heat or broiler. As the cone cooks, lower parts are basted with the juices running off the upper parts. The outside of the meat is sliced vertically in thin, crisp shavings when done.

The rate of roasting can be adjusted by varying the intensity of the heat, the distance between the heat and the meat, and the speed of spit rotation, thus allowing the cook to adjust for varying rates of consumption.

In Greece, it is customarily served in an oiled, lightly grilled piece of pita, rolled up with sliced tomatoes, chopped onions, lettuce, and fried potatoes, sometimes topped with tzatziki, or, sometimes in northern Greece, ketchup or mustard.

<doc id="341078" wikidata="Q585087" url="?curid=341078" title="Order of St Michael and St George">
<text>The Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George is a British order of chivalry founded on 28 April 1818 by George, Prince of Wales (the future King George IV), while he was acting as prince regent for his father, King George III. It is named in honour of two military saints, Michael and George.

The Order of St Michael and St George was originally awarded to those holding commands or high position in the Mediterranean territories acquired in the Napoleonic Wars, and it was subsequently extended to holders of similar office or position in other territories of the British Empire. It is at present awarded to men and women who hold high office or who render extraordinary or important non-military service to the United Kingdom in a foreign country, and it can also be conferred for important or loyal service in relation to foreign and Commonwealth affairs.

==Description==
The three classes of appointment to the Order are, from highest grade to lowest grade:
# Knight Grand Cross or Dame Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG)
# Knight Commander or Dame Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG or DCMG)
# Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (CMG)


It is used to honour individuals who have rendered important services in relation to Commonwealth or foreign nations. People are appointed to the Order rather than awarded it. British Ambassadors to foreign nations are regularly appointed as KCMGs, DCMGs, or CMGs. For example, the former British Ambassador to the United States, Sir David Manning, was appointed a CMG when he worked for the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and then after his appointment as British Ambassador to the US, he was promoted to a Knight Commander (KCMG). It is the traditional award for members of the FCO.

The Order&#x27;s motto is &quot;Auspicium melioris ævi&quot; (Latin for &quot;Token of a better age&quot;). Its patron saints, as the name suggests, are St. Michael the Archangel, and St. George, patron saint of England and of soldiers. One of its primary symbols is that of St Michael trampling over and subduing Satan in battle.

The Order is the sixth-most senior in the British honours system, after The Most Noble Order of the Garter, The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick, The Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India. The third of the aforementioned Orders—which relates to Ireland, no longer fully a part of the United Kingdom—still exists but is in disuse; no appointments have been made to it since 1936. The last of the Orders on the list, related to India, has also been in disuse since that country&#x27;s independence in 1947.

==History==
The Prince Regent founded the Order to commemorate the British amical protectorate over the Ionian Islands, which had come under British control in 1814 and had been granted their own constitution as the United States of the Ionian Islands in 1817. It was intended to reward &quot;natives of the Ionian Islands and of the island of Malta and its dependencies, and for such other subjects of His Majesty as may hold high and confidential situations in the Mediterranean&quot;.

In 1864, however, the protectorate ended and the Ionian Islands became part of Greece. A revision of the basis of the Order in 1868, saw membership granted to those who &quot;hold high and confidential offices within Her Majesty&#x27;s colonial possessions, and in reward for services rendered to the Crown in relation to the foreign affairs of the Empire&quot;. Accordingly, nowadays, almost all Governors-General and Governors feature as recipients of awards in the order, typically as Knights or Dames Grand Cross.

In 1965 the order was opened to women, with Evelyn Bark becoming the first female CMG in 1967.

==Composition==
The British sovereign is the Sovereign of the Order and appoints all other members of the Order (by convention, on the advice of the Government). The next-most senior member is the Grand Master. The office was formerly filled by the Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands; now, however, Grand Masters are chosen by the Sovereign. Grand Masters include:

* 1818–1825: Sir Thomas Maitland
* 1825–1850: Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge
* 1850–1904: Prince George, Duke of Cambridge
* 1905–1910: George, Prince of Wales
* 1910–1917: None
* 1917–1936: Edward, Prince of Wales
* 1936–1957: Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone
* 1957–1959: Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax
* 1959–1967: Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis
* 1967–present: Prince Edward, Duke of Kent

The Order originally included 15 Knights Grand Cross, 20 Knights Commanders, and 25 Companions but has since been expanded and the current limits on membership are 125, 375, and 1,750 respectively. Members of the royal family who are appointed to the Order do not count towards the limit, nor do foreign members appointed as &quot;honorary members&quot;.

===Officers===
The Order has six officers. The Order&#x27;s King of Arms is not a member of the College of Arms, like many other heraldic officers. The Usher of the Order is known as the Gentleman or Lady Usher of the Blue Rod. Blue Rod does not, unlike the usher of the Order of the Garter, perform any duties related to the House of Lords.

==Habit and insignia==

Members of the Order wear elaborate regalia on important occasions (such as coronations), which vary by rank:
* The &quot;mantle&quot;, worn only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross, is made of Saxon blue satin lined with crimson silk. On the left side is a representation of the star (see below). The mantle is bound with two large tassels.
* The &quot;collar&quot;, worn only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross, is made of gold. It consists of depictions of crowned English lions, Maltese Crosses, and the cyphers &quot;SM&quot; and &quot;SG&quot;, all alternately. In the centre are two winged lions of St. Mark, each holding a bible and seven arrows—the emblem of the seven united Ionian Islands.

At less important occasions, simpler insignia are used:
* The &quot;star&quot; is an insignia used only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross and Knights and Dames Commanders. It is worn pinned to the left breast. The Knight and Dame Grand Cross&#x27; star includes seven-armed, silver-rayed &#x27;Maltese Asterisk&#x27; (for want of a better description—see image of badge), with a gold ray in between each pair of arms. The Knight and Dame Commander&#x27;s star is a slightly smaller eight-pointed silver figure formed by two Maltese Crosses; it does not include any gold rays. In each case, the star bears a red cross of St George. In the centre of the star is a dark blue ring bearing the motto of the Order. Within the ring is a representation of St Michael trampling on Satan.
* The &quot;badge&quot; is the only insignia used by all members of the Order; it is suspended on a blue-crimson-blue ribbon. Knights and Dames Grand Cross wear it on a riband or sash, passing from the right shoulder to the left hip. Knights Commanders and male Companions wear the badge from a ribbon around the neck; Dames Commanders and female Companions wear it from a bow on the left shoulder. The badge is a seven-armed, white-enamelled &#x27;Maltese Asterisk&#x27; (see Maltese Cross); the obverse shows St Michael trampling on Satan, while the reverse shows St George on horseback killing a dragon, both within a dark blue ring bearing the motto of the Order.

Prior to 2011, the devil was portrayed with black skin while St Michael was shown as being white; this was changed that year to show both with same skin colour, although St Michael&#x27;s wings were changed from being multi-colour to being pure white. The alleged racism of this imagery has resulted in the government of Jamaica suspending the use of the badge entirely. In June 2020, calls were made for a complete redesign of the insignia, including from Sir Michael Palin of Monty Python fame, a Knight Commander of the Order In July, the Cabinet Office announced that officers of the Order who were unhappy with their insignia could exchange them for one of the newer models.

On certain collar days designated by the Sovereign, members attending formal events may wear the Order&#x27;s collar over their military uniform or morning wear. When collars are worn (either on collar days or on formal occasions such as coronations), the badge is suspended from the collar. All collars which have been awarded since 1948 must be returned to the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood. The other insignia may be retained.

==Chapel==
The original home of the Order was the Palace of St. Michael and St. George in Corfu, the residence of the Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands and the seat of the Ionian Senate. Since 1906, the Order&#x27;s chapel has been in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. (The cathedral also serves as home to the chapels of the Order of the British Empire and the Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor.) Religious services for the whole Order are held quadrennially; new Knights and Dames Grand Cross are installed at these services.

The Sovereign and the Knights and Dames Grand Cross are allotted stalls in the choir of the chapel, above which their heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight&#x27;s stall is his helm, decorated with a mantling and topped by his crest. Under English heraldic law, women other than monarchs do not bear helms or crests; instead, the coronet appropriate to the dame&#x27;s rank, if there is one, is used. Above the crest or coronet, the stall&#x27;s occupant&#x27;s heraldic banner is hung, emblazoned with his or her coat of arms. At a considerably smaller scale, to the back of the stall is affixed a piece of brass (a &quot;stall plate&quot;) displaying its occupant&#x27;s name, arms and date of admission into the Order. Upon the death of a Knight, the banner, helm, mantling and crest are taken down. The stall plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain permanently affixed somewhere about the stall, so that the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order&#x27;s Knights and Dames Grand Cross since 1906.

The reredos within the chapel was commissioned from Henry Poole in 1927.

==Precedence and privileges==
Members of the Order of St Michael are assigned positions in the order of precedence in England and Wales. Wives of male members also feature on the order of precedence, as do sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commanders; relatives of female members, however, are not assigned any special precedence. (Individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their mothers or wives. This follows the general rule of honours, that a husband never derives any style or title from his wife.)

Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commanders prefix &quot;Sir&quot;, and Dames Grand Cross and Dames Commanders prefix &quot;Dame&quot;, to their forenames. Wives of Knights may prefix &quot;Lady&quot; to their surnames, but husbands of Dames derive no title from their wives. Such forms are not used by peers and princes, except when the names of the former are written out in their fullest forms. Furthermore, honorary (foreign) members and clergymen do not receive the accolade and thus are not entitled to use the prefix &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot;. Knights and Dames Grand Cross use the post-nominal &quot;GCMG&quot;; Knights Commanders and Dames Commanders use &quot;KCMG&quot; and &quot;DCMG&quot; respectively; Companions use &quot;CMG&quot;.

Knights and Dames Grand Cross are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters. They may, furthermore, encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a circle bearing the motto) and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. Knights and Dames Commanders and Companions may display the circlet, but not the collar, surrounding their arms. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar or circlet.

==Popular references==
In the satirical British television programme &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, Jim Hacker MP is told a joke by his Private Secretary, Bernard Woolley, about what the various post-nominals stand for. From Series 2, Episode 2 &quot;Doing the Honours&quot;:

Ian Fleming&#x27;s spy, James Bond, a commander in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), was fictionally decorated as a CMG in 1953. This is mentioned in the novels &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; and &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, and on-screen in his obituary in &quot;Skyfall&quot;. He was offered appointment as KCMG (which would have elevated him from Companion to Knight Commander in the Order) in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, but he rejected the offer as he did not wish to become a public figure. Judi Dench&#x27;s character &quot;M&quot; is &quot;offered&quot; early retirement as a GCMG in &quot;Skyfall&quot;.

Daniel Craig, who has portrayed Bond on film, was appointed (CMG) in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to film and theatre. The general release on 30 September 2021 of his last appearance as James Bond, in &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, had been delayed by almost two years due to a change of director and the COVID-19 pandemic. Coinciding with the film&#x27;s premiere, and matching his fictional character&#x27;s rank, Craig became an Honorary Commander in Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy. Following this appointment, he committed to being an ambassador for the Royal Navy, particularly in its international role, and to the welfare of its service families.

Long-time &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companion Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart wore the ribbon of the order as the highest of his decorations.

<doc id="341083" wikidata="Q910917" url="?curid=341083" title="Spin (aerodynamics)">
<text>In flight dynamics a spin is a special category of stall resulting in autorotation (uncommanded roll) about the aircraft&#x27;s longitudinal axis and a shallow, rotating, downward path approximately centred on a vertical axis. Spins can be entered intentionally or unintentionally, from any flight attitude if the aircraft has sufficient yaw while at the stall point.
In a normal spin, the wing on the inside of the turn stalls while the outside wing remains flying. It is possible for both wings to stall, but the angle of attack of each wing, and consequently its lift and drag, are different.

Either situation causes the aircraft to autorotate toward the stalled wing due to its higher drag and loss of lift. Spins are characterized by high angle of attack, an airspeed below the stall on at least one wing and a shallow descent. Recovery and avoiding a crash may require a specific and counter-intuitive set of actions.

A spin differs from a spiral dive, in which neither wing is stalled and which is characterized by a low angle of attack and high airspeed. A spiral dive is not a type of spin because neither wing is stalled. In a spiral dive, the aircraft responds conventionally to the pilot&#x27;s inputs to the flight controls, and recovery from a spiral dive requires a different set of actions from those required to recover from a spin.

In the early years of flight, a spin was frequently referred to as a &quot;tailspin&quot;.

==How a spin occurs==
Many types of airplanes spin only if the pilot simultaneously yaws and stalls the airplane (intentionally or unintentionally). Under these circumstances, one wing stalls, or stalls more deeply than the other. The wing that stalls first drops, increasing its angle of attack and deepening the stall. At least one wing must be stalled for a spin to occur. The other wing rises, decreasing its angle of attack, and the aircraft yaws towards the more deeply stalled wing. The difference in lift between the two wings causes the aircraft to roll, and the difference in drag causes the aircraft to continue yawing.

The spin characteristics diagram shown in this section is typical of an aircraft with moderate or high aspect ratio and little or no sweepback which leads to spin motion which is primarily rolling with moderate yaw. For a low aspect ratio swept wing with relatively large yaw and pitch inertia the diagram will be different and illustrates a predominance of yaw.

One common scenario that can lead to an unintentional spin is a skidding uncoordinated turn toward the runway during the landing sequence. A pilot who is overshooting the turn to final approach may be tempted to apply more rudder to increase the rate of turn. The result is twofold: the nose of the airplane drops below the horizon, and the bank angle increases due to rudder roll. Reacting to these unintended changes, the pilot then begins to pull the elevator control aft (thus increasing the angle of attack and load factor) while applying opposite aileron to decrease bank angle.

Taken to its extreme, this can result in an uncoordinated turn with sufficient angle of attack to cause the aircraft to stall. This is called a &quot;cross-control stall&quot;, and is very dangerous if it happens at low altitude where the pilot has little time to recover. To avoid this scenario, pilots learn the importance of always making coordinated turns. They may simply choose to make the final turn earlier and shallower to prevent an overshoot of the runway center line and provide a larger margin of safety. Certificated, light, single-engine airplanes must meet specific criteria regarding stall and spin behavior. Spins are often entered intentionally for training, flight testing, or aerobatics.

==Phases==

In aircraft that are capable of recovering from a spin, the spin has four phases. At low altitude, spin recovery may also be impossible before impacting terrain, making low and slow aircraft especially vulnerable to spin-related accidents. 
* Entry – The airplane is stalled by exceeding the wing&#x27;s critical angle of attack, while allowing the aircraft to yaw, or by inducing yaw with rudder initiated skidding uncoordinated flight.
* Buffeting – At the critical angle of attack the boundary layer of airflow begins to separate from the wing airfoil, causing a loss of lift and resulting in oscillations of the control surfaces from turbulent airflow. 
* Departure – The aircraft can no longer maintain steady flight in a stalled condition and deviates from its original flight-path.
* Post-stall gyration – The aircraft begins rotating about all three axes, the nose pitch attitude may fall, or in some cases rise, the aircraft begins yawing, and one wing drops.

Spins can be classified using the following descriptors: 
* Incipient – With the inside wing stalled more deeply than the advancing wing, both the roll and yaw motions dominate.
* Developed – The aircraft&#x27;s rotation rate, airspeed, and vertical speed are stabilized. One wing is stalled more deeply than the other as the aircraft spins downward along a corkscrew path.
* Recovery – With appropriate control inputs, the yaw rotation is slowed or stopped and the aircraft nose attitude is lowered, thus decreasing the wing&#x27;s angle of attack and breaking the stall. Airspeed increases quickly in a nose low attitude and the aircraft is no longer in a spin. The controls respond conventionally and the airplane can be returned to normal flight.

==Modes==
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has defined four different modes of spinning, defined by the angle of attack of the airflow on the wing.

During the 1970s, NASA used its spin tunnel at the Langley Research Center to investigate the spinning characteristics of single-engine general-aviation airplane designs. A 1/11-scale model was used with nine different tail designs.

Some tail designs that caused inappropriate spin characteristics had two stable spin modes—one steep or moderately steep, and another that was either moderately flat or flat. Recovery from the flatter of the two modes was usually less reliable or impossible. When the center of gravity was further aft, the spin was flatter, and the recovery was less reliable. For all tests, the center of gravity of the model was at either 14.5% of mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) or 25.5% of MAC.

Single-engine airplane types certified in the normal category must be demonstrated to recover from a spin of at least one turn, while single-engine aircraft certified in the utility category must demonstrate a six-turn spin that cannot be unrecoverable at any time during the spin due to pilot action or aerodynamic characteristic. NASA recommends various tail configurations and other strategies to eliminate the flatter of the two spin modes and make recovery from the steeper mode more reliable.

==History==
In aviation&#x27;s early days, spins were poorly understood and often fatal. Proper recovery procedures were unknown, and a pilot&#x27;s instinct to pull back on the stick served only to make a spin worse. Because of this, the spin earned a reputation as an unpredictable danger that might snatch an aviator&#x27;s life at any time, and against which there was no defense. In early aviation, individual pilots explored spins by performing ad-hoc experiments (often accidentally), and aerodynamicists examined the phenomenon. Lincoln Beachey was able to exit spins at will, according to Harry Bruno in &quot;Wings over America&quot; (1944).

In August 1912, Lieutenant Wilfred Parke RN became the first aviator to recover from an accidental spin when his Avro Type G biplane entered a spin at AGL in the traffic pattern at Larkhill. Parke attempted to recover from the spin by increasing engine speed, pulling back on the stick, and turning into the spin, with no effect. The aircraft descended , and horrified observers expected a fatal crash. Though disabled by centrifugal forces, Parke still sought an escape. In an effort to neutralize the forces pinning him against the right side of the cockpit, he applied full right rudder, and the aircraft leveled out above the ground. With the aircraft now under control, Parke climbed, made another approach, and landed safely.

In spite of the discovery of &quot;Parke&#x27;s technique&quot;, spin-recovery procedures were not a routine part of pilot training until well into World War I. The first documented case of an intentional spin and recovery is that of Harry Hawker. In the summer of 1914, Hawker recovered from an intentional spin over Brooklands, England, by centralizing the controls. Russian aviator Konstantin Artseulov, having independently discovered a recovery technique, somewhat different from Parke&#x27;s and Hawker&#x27;s, on the frontlines, demonstrated it in a dramatic display over the Kacha flight school&#x27;s airfield on September 24, 1916, intentionally flying his Nieuport 21 into a spin and recovering from it twice. Later, Artseulov, at the time an instructor at the school, went on to teach this technique to all of his students, quickly disseminating it among the Russian aviators and beyond.

In 1917, the English physicist Frederick Lindemann conducted a series of experiments in a B.E.2E that led to the first understanding of the aerodynamics of the spin. In Britain, starting in 1917, spin recovery procedures were routinely taught by flight instructors at the Gosport School of Special Flying, while in France, at the School of Acrobacy and Combat, Americans who had volunteered to serve in the famous Lafayette Escadrille were by July 1917 learning how to do what the French called a &quot;vrille&quot;.

During the 1920s and 1930s, before night-flying instruments were commonly available on small aircraft, pilots were often instructed to enter a spin deliberately to avoid the much more dangerous graveyard spiral when they suddenly found themselves enveloped in clouds, hence losing visual reference to the ground. In almost every circumstance, the cloud deck ends above ground level, giving the pilot a reasonable chance to recover from the spin before crashing.
Today, spin training is not required for a private pilot licence in the United States; added to this, most training-type aircraft are placarded &quot;intentional spins prohibited&quot;. Some models of Cessna 172 are certified for spinning although they can be difficult to actually get into a spin. Generally, though, spin training is undertaken in an &quot;Unusual attitude recovery course&quot; or as a part of an aerobatics endorsement (though not all countries actually require training for aerobatics). However, understanding and being able to recover from spins is certainly a skill that a fixed-wing pilot could learn for safety. It is routinely given as part of the training in sailplanes, since gliders often operate slowly enough to be in near-stall conditions while turning. Because of this, in the U.S. demonstration of spin entry and recovery is still expected of glider instructor certification. Also, before their initial certifications both airplane and glider instructors need a logbook endorsement of proficiency in spin training which, under Federal Aviation Regulations 61.183(i), may be given by another instructor. In Canada, spins are a mandatory exercise to get the private and commercial pilot licenses; Canadian recreational pilot permit candidates (1 level below private pilot license) must do a stall and wing drop (the very beginning of the entry to a spin) and must recover from a stall and wing drop as part of training.

==Entry and recovery==

Some aircraft cannot be recovered from a spin using only their own flight control surfaces and must not be allowed to enter a spin under any circumstances. If an aircraft has not been certified for spin recovery, it should be assumed that spins are not recoverable and are unsafe in that aircraft. Important safety equipment, such as stall/spin recovery parachutes, which generally are not installed on production aircraft, are used during testing and certification of aircraft for spins and spin recovery.

Spin-entry procedures vary with the type and model of aircraft being flown but there are general procedures applicable to most aircraft. These include reducing power to idle and simultaneously raising the nose to induce an upright stall. Then, as the aircraft approaches stall, apply full rudder in the desired spin direction while holding full back-elevator pressure for an upright spin. Sometimes a roll input is applied in the direction opposite of the rudder (i.e., a cross-control).

If the aircraft manufacturer provides a specific procedure for spin recovery, that procedure must be used. Otherwise, to recover from an upright spin, the following generic procedure may be used: Power is first reduced to idle and the ailerons are neutralized. Then, full opposite rudder (that is, against the yaw) is added and held to counteract the spin rotation, and the elevator control is moved briskly forward to reduce the angle of attack below the critical angle. Depending on the airplane and type of spin, the elevator action could be a minimal input before rotation ceases, or in other cases the pilot may have to move the elevator control to its full forward position to effect recovery from the upright spin. Once the rotation has stopped, the rudder must be neutralized and the airplane returned to level flight. This procedure is sometimes called PARE, for &quot;P&quot;ower idle, &quot;A&quot;ilerons neutral, &quot;R&quot;udder opposite the spin and held, and &quot;E&quot;levator through neutral.

The mnemonic &quot;PARE&quot; simply reinforces the tried-and-true NASA standard spin recovery actions—the very same actions first prescribed by NACA in 1936, verified by NASA during an intensive, decade-long spin test program overlapping the 1970s and &#x27;80s, and repeatedly recommended by the FAA and implemented by the majority of test pilots during certification spin-testing of light airplanes.

Inverted spinning and erect or upright spinning are dynamically very similar and require essentially the same recovery process but use opposite elevator control. In an upright spin, both roll and yaw are in the same direction, but an inverted spin is composed of opposing roll and yaw. It is crucial that the yaw be countered to effect recovery. The visual field in a typical spin (as opposed to a flat spin) is heavily dominated by the perception of roll over yaw, which can lead to an incorrect and dangerous conclusion that a given inverted spin is actually an erect spin in the reverse yaw direction (leading to a recovery attempt in which pro-spin rudder is mistakenly applied and then further exacerbated by holding the incorrect elevator input).
In some aircraft that spin readily upright and inverted, such as Pitts- and Christen Eagle-type high-performance aerobatic aircraft, an alternative spin-recovery technique may effect recovery as well, namely: Power off, Hands off the stick/yoke, Rudder full opposite to the spin (or more simply &quot;push the rudder pedal that is hardest to push&quot;) and held (aka the Mueller/Beggs technique). An advantage of the Mueller/Beggs technique is that no knowledge of whether the spin is erect or inverted is required during what can be a very stressful and disorienting time. Even though this method does work in a specific subset of spin-approved airplanes, the NASA Standard/PARE procedure can also be effective provided that care must be taken to ensure the spin does not simply cross from positive to negative (or vice versa) and that a too-rapid application of elevator control is avoided as it may cause aerodynamic blanketing of the rudder rendering the control ineffective and simply accelerate the spin. The converse, however, may not be true at all—many cases exist where Beggs/Mueller fails to recover the airplane from the spin, but NASA Standard/PARE terminates the spin. Before spinning any aircraft, a pilot should consult the flight manual to establish if the particular aircraft type has any specific spin recovery techniques that differ from standard practice.

A pilot can induce a flat spin once the spin is established by applying full opposite aileron to the direction of rotation—hence, the requirement to neutralize ailerons in the normal spin recovery technique. The aileron application creates a differential induced drag that raises the nose toward a level pitch attitude. As the nose comes up the tail moves out farther from the center of rotation increasing lateral airflow over the empennage. The increase in lateral flow across the vertical stabilizer/rudder brings it to its critical angle of attack stalling it. The normal recovery input of opposite rudder further increases angle of attack, deepening the tail stall and so rudder input is ineffective to slow/stop rotation. Recovery is initiated by maintaining pro-spin elevator and rudder and applying full aileron into the spin. Differential drag now lowers the nose returning the plane to a normal spin from which the PARE technique is used to exit the maneuver.

Although entry techniques are similar, modern military fighter aircraft often tend to require yet another variation on spin recovery techniques. While power is still typically reduced to idle thrust and pitch control neutralized, opposite rudder is almost never used. Adverse yaw created by the rolling surfaces (ailerons, differential horizontal tails, etc.) of such aircraft is often more effective in arresting the spin rotation than the rudder(s), which usually become blanked by the wing and fuselage due to the geometric arrangement of fighters. Hence, the preferred recover technique has a pilot applying full roll control in the direction of the rotation (&quot;i.e.&quot;, a right-hand spin requires a right stick input), generally remembered as &quot;stick into the spin&quot;. Likewise, this control application is reversed for inverted spins.

==Center of gravity==

The characteristics of an airplane with respect to spinning are significantly influenced by the position of the center of gravity. In general terms, the further forward the center of gravity the less readily the airplane will spin, and the more readily it can recover from a spin. Conversely, the further aft the center of gravity the more readily the airplane will spin, and the less readily it can recover from a spin. In any airplane, the forward and aft limits on center of gravity are carefully defined. In some airplanes that are approved for intentional spinning, the aft limit at which spins may be attempted is not as far aft as the aft limit for general flying.

Intentional spinning should not be attempted casually, and the most important pre-flight precaution is to determine that the airplane&#x27;s center of gravity is within the range approved for intentional spinning. For this reason, pilots should first determine what tendency the airplane has before it stalls. If the tendency is to pitch down (nose-heavy) when it stalls, then the aircraft is likely to recover on its own. However, if the tendency is to pitch up (tail-heavy) when it stalls, the aircraft will likely transition into a flat spin where stall recovery would be delayed, or it may not be recoverable at all.

Before practicing spins, one recommended method is to determine the aircraft&#x27;s stall tendency by doing a pitch test. To do this, slowly reduce power to idle and see which way the nose pitches. If it pitches down, then the aircraft is stall recoverable. If the nose pitches up, then the stall would be difficult to recover or altogether unrecoverable. The pitch test should be done just prior to performing a spin maneuver.

==Unrecoverable spins==

If the center of gravity of the airplane is behind the aft limit approved for spinning, any spin may prove unrecoverable except by using some special spin-recovery device such as a spin-recovery parachute specially installed in the tail of the airplane; or by jettisoning specially installed ballast at the tail of the airplane.

Some World War II airplanes were notoriously prone to spins when loaded erroneously; for example, the Bell P-39 Airacobra. The P-39 was an unusual design with the engine behind the pilot&#x27;s seat and a large cannon in the front. Soviet pilots did numerous tests of the P-39 and were able to demonstrate its dangerous spinning characteristics. 

Modern fighter aircraft are not immune to the phenomenon of unrecoverable spin characteristics. Another example of a nonrecoverable spin occurred in 1963, with Chuck Yeager at the controls of the NF-104A rocket-jet hybrid: during his fourth attempt at setting an altitude record, Yeager lost control and entered a spin, then ejected and survived. On the other hand, the Cornfield Bomber was a case where the ejection of the pilot shifted the center of gravity enough to let the now-empty aircraft self-recover from a spin and land itself.
In purpose-built aerobatic aircraft, spins may be intentionally flattened through the application of power and aileron within a normal spin. Rotation rates experienced are dramatic and can exceed 400 degrees per second in an attitude that may even have the nose above the horizon. Such maneuvers must be performed with the center of gravity in the normal range and with appropriate training, and consideration should be given to the extreme gyroscopic forces generated by the propeller and exerted on the crankshaft. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; lists the highest number of consecutive inverted flat spins at 98, set by Spencer Suderman on March 20, 2016, flying an experimental variant of the Pitts S-1 designated the Sunbird S-1x. Suderman started from an altitude of and recovered at .

==Aircraft design==
For safety, all certificated, single-engine fixed-wing aircraft, including certificated gliders, must meet specified criteria regarding stall and spin behavior. Complying designs typically have a wing with greater angle of attack at the wing root than at the wing tip, so that the wing root stalls first, reducing the severity of the wing drop at the stall and possibly also allowing the ailerons to remain somewhat effective until the stall migrates outward toward the wing tip. One method of tailoring such stall behavior is known as washout. Some designers of recreational aircraft seek to develop an aircraft that is characteristically incapable of spinning, even in an uncoordinated stall.

Some airplanes have been designed with fixed leading edge slots. Where the slots are located ahead of the ailerons, they provide strong resistance to stalling and may even leave the airplane incapable of spinning.

The flight control systems of some gliders and recreational aircraft are designed so that when the pilot moves the elevator control close to its fully aft position, as in low speed flight and flight at high angle of attack, the trailing edges of both ailerons are automatically raised slightly so that the angle of attack is reduced at the outboard regions of both wings. This necessitates an increase in angle of attack at the inboard (center) regions of the wing, and promotes stalling of the inboard regions well before the wing tips.
A US certification standard for civil airplanes up to maximum takeoff weight is Part 23 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, applicable to airplanes in the normal, utility and acrobatic categories. Part 23, §23.221 requires that single-engine airplanes must demonstrate recovery from either a one-turn spin if intentional spins are prohibited or six-turn spins if intentional spins are approved. Even large, passenger-carrying single-engine airplanes like the Cessna Caravan must be subjected to one-turn spins by a test pilot and repeatedly demonstrated to recover within no more than one additional turn. With a small number of airplane types the FAA has made a finding of equivalent level of safety (ELOS) so that demonstration of a one-turn spin is not necessary. For example, this has been done with the Cessna Corvalis and the Cirrus SR20/22. Successful demonstration of the one-turn spin does not get an airplane approved for intentional spinning. To get an airplane approved for intentional spinning, a test pilot must repeatedly subject it to a spin of six turns and then demonstrate recovery within one and a half additional turns. Spin testing is a potentially hazardous exercise, and the test aircraft must be equipped with some spin-recovery device such as a tail parachute, jettisonable ballast, or some method of rapidly moving the center of gravity forward.

Agricultural airplanes are typically certificated in the normal category at a moderate weight. For single-engine airplanes this requires successful demonstration of the one-turn spin. However, with the agriculture hopper full these airplanes are not intended to be spun, and recovery is unlikely. For this reason, at weights above the maximum for the normal category, these airplanes are not subjected to spin testing and, as a consequence, can only be type certificated in the restricted category. As an example of an agricultural airplane, see the Cessna AG series.

==Spin kit==

To make some sailplanes spin easily for training purposes or demonstrations, a spin kit is available from the manufacturer.

Many training aircraft may appear resistant to entering a spin, even though some are intentionally designed and certified for spins. A well-known example of an aircraft designed to spin readily is the Piper Tomahawk, which is certified for spins, though the Piper Tomahawk&#x27;s spin characteristics remain controversial. Aircraft that are not certified for spins may be difficult or impossible to recover once the spin exceeds the one-turn certification standard.

Though spinning has been removed from most flight training courses, some countries still require flight training on spin recovery. The U.S. requires spin training for civilian flight instructor candidates and military pilots. A spin occurs only after a stall, so the FAA emphasizes training pilots in stall recognition, prevention, and recovery as a means to reduce accidents due to unintentional stalls or spins.

A spin is often intimidating to the uninitiated, however many pilots trained in spin entry and recovery find that the experience builds awareness and confidence. In a spin, the occupants of the airplane only feel reduced gravity during the entry phase and then experience normal gravity, except that the extreme nose-down attitude presses the occupants forward against their restraint harnesses. The rapid rotation, combined with the nose-down attitude, results in a visual effect called &quot;ground flow&quot; that can be disorienting.

The recovery procedure from a spin requires using rudder to stop the rotation, then elevator to reduce angle of attack to stop the stall, then pulling out of the dive without exceeding the maximum permitted airspeed (VNE) or maximum G loading. The maximum G loading for a light airplane in the normal category is usually 3.8 G. For a light airplane in the acrobatic category it is usually at least 6 G.

<doc id="341086" wikidata="Q2488768" url="?curid=341086" title="Non-monotonic logic">
<text>A non-monotonic logic is a formal logic whose entailment relation is not monotonic. In other words, non-monotonic logics are devised to capture and represent defeasible inferences, i.e., a kind of inference in which reasoners draw tentative conclusions, enabling reasoners to retract their conclusion(s) based on further evidence.
Most studied formal logics have a monotonic entailment relation, meaning that adding a formula to the hypotheses never produces a pruning of its set of conclusions. Intuitively, monotonicity indicates that learning a new piece of knowledge cannot reduce the set of what is known. Monotonic logics cannot handle various reasoning tasks such as reasoning by default (conclusions may be derived only because of lack of evidence of the contrary), abductive reasoning (conclusions are only deduced as most likely explanations), some important approaches to reasoning about knowledge (the ignorance of a conclusion must be retracted when the conclusion becomes known), and similarly, belief revision (new knowledge may contradict old beliefs).

==Abductive reasoning==

Abductive reasoning is the process of deriving a sufficient explanation of the known facts. An abductive logic should not be monotonic because the likely explanations are not necessarily correct. For example, the likely explanation for seeing wet grass is that it rained; however, this explanation has to be retracted when learning that the real cause of the grass being wet was a sprinkler. Since the old explanation (it rained) is retracted because of the addition of a piece of knowledge (a sprinkler was active), any logic that models explanations is non-monotonic.

==Reasoning about knowledge==

If a logic includes formulae that mean that something is not known, this logic should not be monotonic. Indeed, learning something that was previously not known leads to the removal of the formula specifying that this piece of knowledge is not known. This second change (a removal caused by an addition) violates the condition of monotonicity. A logic for reasoning about knowledge is the autoepistemic logic.

==Belief revision==

Belief revision is the process of changing beliefs to accommodate a new belief that might be inconsistent with the old ones. In the assumption that the new belief is correct, some of the old ones have to be retracted in order to maintain consistency. This retraction in response to an addition of a new belief makes any logic for belief revision non-monotonic. The belief revision approach is alternative to paraconsistent logics, which tolerate inconsistency rather than attempting to remove it.

==Proof-theoretic versus model-theoretic formalizations of non-monotonic logics==

Proof-theoretic formalization of a non-monotonic logic begins with adoption of certain non-monotonic rules of inference, and then prescribes contexts in which these non-monotonic rules may be applied in admissible deductions. This typically is accomplished by means of fixed-point equations that relate the sets of premises and the sets of their non-monotonic conclusions. Default logic and autoepistemic logic are the most common examples of non-monotonic logics that have been formalized that way.

Model-theoretic formalization of a non-monotonic logic begins with restriction of the semantics of a suitable monotonic logic to some special models, for instance, to minimal models, and then derives a set of non-monotonic rules of inference, possibly with some restrictions on which contexts these rules may be applied in, so that the resulting deductive system is sound and complete with respect to the restricted semantics. Unlike some proof-theoretic formalizations that suffered from well-known paradoxes and were often hard to evaluate with respect of their consistency with the intuitions they were supposed to capture, model-theoretic formalizations were paradox-free and left little, if any, room for confusion about what non-monotonic patterns of reasoning they covered. Examples of proof-theoretic formalizations of non-monotonic reasoning, which revealed some undesirable or paradoxical properties or did not capture the desired intuitive comprehensions, that have been successfully (consistent with respective intuitive comprehensions and with no paradoxical properties, that is) formalized by model-theoretic means include first-order circumscription, closed-world assumption, and autoepistemic logic.

<doc id="341087" wikidata="Q750023" url="?curid=341087" title="Bender (Futurama)">
<text>Bender Bending Rodríguez (designated in-universe as Bending Unit 22, unit number 1,729, serial number 2716057) is one of the main characters in the animated television series &quot;Futurama&quot;. He was conceived by the series&#x27; creators Matt Groening and David X. Cohen, and is voiced by John DiMaggio. He fulfills a comic, antihero-type role in the show, and is described by fellow character Leela as an &quot;alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gambler&quot;.

According to the character&#x27;s backstory, Bender was built in Tijuana, Mexico (the other characters refer to his &quot;swarthy Latin charm&quot;), his name a reference to bending in Mexican maquiladoras. 

Bender is known for being prejudiced against non-robots. For example, one of his signature expressions is &quot;kill all humans&quot;. Those who are not subject to Bender&#x27;s prejudicial attitude are documented on his &quot;Do Not Kill&quot; list, which includes only his best friend Philip J. Fry and his colleague Hermes Conrad (added after the episode &quot;Lethal Inspection&quot;). However, Bender is also occasionally portrayed as possessing a sympathetic side, suggesting that he is not as belligerent as he claims, a view often echoed by his friends.

==Character biography==
Bender, a high-tech industrial metalworking robot, was built in 2996 at Fábrica Robótica De La Madre (Spanish: &quot;Mom&#x27;s Robot Factory&quot;), a manufacturing facility of Mom&#x27;s Friendly Robot Company in Tijuana, Mexico. However, the story of his construction remains a mystery. Although different creation processes have been shown, Cohen has stated that the viewer has only been shown Bender emerging from the machine that created him, while what happened inside the machine has not yet been revealed. According to one version, suggested by Hermes&#x27; flashback, and also by a reverse aging process shown in the episode &quot;Teenage Mutant Leela&#x27;s Hurdles&quot;, a newborn Bender possessed a baby-like body. In &quot;Bendless Love&quot;, however, Bender is portrayed with a normal, adult-sized body in a flashback sequence conveying his memory of coming into existence. As Bender&#x27;s memory chip contains an adult form, the episode&#x27;s content suggests that the character might actually be recalling a transfer to an adult body, rather than the moment of creation.

Unlike most other robots, Bender is mortal and, according to Professor Farnsworth&#x27;s calculations, may have less than one billion years to live. Because of a manufacturing error that left Bender without a backup unit, Bender&#x27;s memory cannot be transferred or uploaded to another robot body. After reporting that defect to his manufacturer, Bender barely escapes death from a guided missile and a robot death squad dispatched by Mom in order to eliminate him and effectively take the defective product off the market.

At the factory, Bender was programmed for cold-bending structural steel. Bender later attended Bending State University, where he majored in bending and minored in Robo-American Studies. At the university, he was a member of Epsilon Rho Rho (ERR), a robot fraternity, where he became something of a fraternity hero for his many shenanigans: one night he chugged an entire keg of beer, streaked across campus, and stuffed 58 people into a telephone booth (although he concedes they were mostly children).

Before meeting Fry and Leela and joining Planet Express (where he currently works as the assistant manager of sales and as company chef), Bender had a job at the metalworking factory, bending steel girders for the construction of suicide booths.

Bender has an apartment (00100100, the ASCII code for the dollar sign &quot;$&quot;) in the &quot;Robot Arms Apts.&quot; building, where he eventually invites his best friend and coworker, Fry, to live with him. Although the pair enjoy living together, Bender is sometimes portrayed as manipulating his guileless friend. In the series&#x27; early episodes, Bender is shown preferring to occupy smaller areas of their apartment, like the closet, referring to them as &quot;cozy&quot;, although in later episodes he is shown to have his own individual bedroom, like Fry.

Throughout the series, he enters many romantic relationships of varying duration, and is commonly referred to as a womanizer by his friends. He does not seem to discriminate between human women and their robot or &quot;fem-bot&quot; counterparts, and is shown actively pursuing both. Likewise, his taste in fem-bot partners does not seem to be affected by the fem-bot&#x27;s height or weight, and he is shown numerous times chasing fem-bots of all builds. In &quot;Proposition Infinity&quot;, Bender&#x27;s secret affair with coworker Amy Wong leads to a referendum that, once approved, legalizes robosexuality. In &quot;The Bots and the Bees&quot;, he has a sexual encounter with a fem-bot soda vending machine that leads to the almost-instantaneous birth of a son, whom he names Ben, after the first part of his own name.

Professor Farnsworth describes Bender to be constructed of an alloy of iron and osmium - despite Bender himself claiming to be made of 40% titanium in Season 2 Episode 13. The Professor also states Bender contains a 0.04% nickel impurity, a trait which he claimed made himself unique. Bender hates magnets, as magnets interfere with his inhibition unit, causing him to uncontrollably start singing folk music/folk songs when near his head, and also causing him to reveal his secret ambition to be a folk singer. He once was able to attach a magnetic small faux-beard underneath his mouth without breaking into song. Bender also has a near-pathological fear of electric can openers due to the death of his father, caused by one, and the fact that it once ripped open the top of his head as it would a can.

==Character==

===Creation===
The name Bender was chosen by creator Matt Groening as an homage to John Bender (played by Judd Nelson), a character in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;. In that film, John Bender told Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason), &quot;Eat my shorts,&quot; an eventual catchphrase for another Groening creation, Bart Simpson.

Bender&#x27;s visual design went through multiple changes before reaching its final state. One of the decisions which Groening found to be particularly difficult was whether Bender&#x27;s head should be square or round. Initially he worked under the idea that all robots would have square heads in the year 3000; however, it was later decided that Bender&#x27;s head should be round, a visual play on the idea that Bender is a &quot;round peg in a square hole&quot;.

===Voice===

When casting for &quot;Futurama&quot;, Bender&#x27;s voice was the most difficult to cast, in part because the show&#x27;s creators had not yet decided what robots should sound like. Because of this, every voice actor who auditioned, no matter for what role, was also asked to read for Bender. After about 300 auditions, even series co-creator Cohen attempted to audition after being told he sounded like a robot. John DiMaggio was eventually chosen for the role after his second audition.

DiMaggio originally auditioned using his Bender voice for the role of Professor Farnsworth and also used a voice later used for URL the police robot for Bender.
He describes the voice he got the part with as a combination of a sloppy drunk, Slim Pickens, and a character one of his college friends created named &quot;Charlie the sausage-lover&quot;. Casting directors liked that he made the character sound like a drunk, rather than an automaton. DiMaggio has noted that he had difficulty singing as Bender in &quot;Hell Is Other Robots&quot; because he was forced to sing the harmony part in a low key.

On March 1, 2022, following publicized contract negotiations, DiMaggio confirmed he is reprising his role for the Hulu revival.

==Design==
Bender&#x27;s factory-set height is just over tall, including his antenna, and just under it without. In &quot;The Farnsworth Parabox&quot;, Bender states that he flipped a coin to decide his color, ending up with foghat gray rather than gold. In &quot;The Cyber House Rules&quot;, Bender shows the kids a black-and-white mug shot of himself taken after his arrest for theft. In &quot;Time Keeps on Slippin&#x27;&quot;, Bender is shown trying to join a basketball team and makes himself taller by simply extending his legs. His body has a &quot;shiny metal ass&quot;, two legs, two &quot;Extens-o-matic&quot; arms (right called &quot;Gropie&quot; and left &quot;Cheatie&quot; by Bender) with three fingers each, a head with two replaceable eyes shaped like light-emitting diodes, and a mouth used for fuel intake and voice communication. In &quot;Bender Gets Made&quot;, Bender claims he also has a nose, but he chooses not to wear it. Bender&#x27;s human-like characteristics are reinforced by his display of behaviors often regarded as exclusive to humans, such as whistling, snoring, having bloodshot eyes, crying, feeling physical attraction, being tickled, dreaming, and belching.

Other bending units of the same model as Bender, such as Flexo, share the same hardware design, but differ in terms of their personality and behavior. For example, Flexo shows personality traits similar to those of Bender but is not quite as &quot;evil&quot; as Bender. In the episode &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;, Leela looks through a simulation of a bending unit&#x27;s sight, which targets potential and then denotes a plan to rob them and leave them in a ditch, implying that all bending robots are somewhat prone to theft and amoral by design. However, another unit, Billy West (named after the series voice actor of the same name), is helpful and kind, though he lives as a farmer on the Moon and insists on not being a bending unit.

Bender&#x27;s serial number, 2716057, can be expressed as the sum of two cubes (9523 + (-9513)), which is humorous to Bender and Flexo after Flexo reveals that his serial number (3370318) has the same characteristic (1193 + 1193) (also, Bender’s designation 1729 is a taxicab number).

===Functions===
Bender was designed specifically for the relatively simple task of bending straight metal girders into various angles. Despite this apparent simplicity, he possesses numerous features superfluous to his original purpose, which become more apparent after an electric jolt to his antenna from an overhead light socket in the pilot episode. The scope of Bender&#x27;s functionality is impressive; he often acts as if he were a multifunctional gadget rather than a special bending machine. Similar to a contemporary computer, he hosts a number of input/output devices: his head has a data socket and remotely operated volume control. His body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket power receptacle, a reset button, a kill switch, and a self-destruct button. Having the hardware-based self-destruct control on his body, rather than in his software, prevents Bender from killing himself in &quot;A Head in the Polls&quot; when he pawns everything but his head, grows desperate without it and desires to kill himself.

Bender is capable of disassembling and reassembling his body at will and operating each detached body part individually and remotely, presumably by using his transmitter and antenna to send wireless signals. His head can be used for a wide range of functions, whether attached to his body or not. In one episode, Leela reassembles Bender into a functioning go-kart (albeit in an event shown in the &quot;What-If&quot; machine).

Bender uses his chest cavity as a locker, which seems to store much more than is physically possible; it is often used to store heads in jars, small children, alcohol, money, loot, the world&#x27;s last darkroom, and, on a few occasions, Fry. In &quot;The Route of All Evil&quot;, the cavity was also used as a boil kettle, hopback and fermentation tank to produce home-made beer. Upon inspection of his body, it appears to be empty, though devices like the F-Ray reveal that, despite appearing hollow, Bender&#x27;s body contains gears and other robotic components.

Being an electronic machine, he can perform quick mathematical calculations.

===Build===
As a bending unit, Bender possesses extraordinary strength, which he often demonstrates by lifting heavy objects, smashing through walls, and even bending an enormous steel girder marked &quot;UNBENDABLE&quot; (in &quot;Bendless Love&quot;). His mechanical nature also makes him far more durable than the rest of the cast, capable of surviving gunfire, explosions, extreme heat, deep water, or hard vacuum.

Even when his body is seemingly destroyed or completely detached from his head, it has no effect on Bender&#x27;s ability to think and communicate, indicating that his main processing facilities are located in his head. Bender&#x27;s hardware is controlled by a factory-loaded operating system, which reboots upon incidental shutdown and automatically adjusts its settings to the environment detected at the time of rebooting. For example, in &quot;The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz&quot;, when Bender reboots, his visual sensors detect a colony of penguins, prompting his boot loader to re-initialize him with penguin-like behavior and language.

He is equipped with a vast capacity of computer data storage, in excess of 100,001 terabytes: 1 TB for general storage and 100,000 TB for the storage of pornography, though in &quot;Overclockwise&quot; Cubert Farnsworth deletes 12 TB of outdated catchphrases from Bender. Presumably either Bender has a separate &quot;catchphrase drive&quot; or the majority of the catchphrases are also pornographic.

===Source of energy===
Bender is powered by alcohol-based fuels, which he can convert into an electrical power source sufficient to operate not only himself, but also small household appliances plugged into his power receptacle. Low alcohol intake levels decrease his production of electricity: when he stops drinking and begins to &quot;sober&quot;, his behavior grows increasingly ebrious and dysfunctional, and he grows a red beard of rust. He is also, apparently, able to sustain himself by consuming mineral oil, though he considers this to be only &#x27;functional&#x27;.

Due to Professor Farnsworth&#x27;s flawed design, the energy conversion process inside Bender&#x27;s body produces an inordinate amount of waste gases and heat. He can expel these products from his rear end or, more often, as a flaming belch.

He also has a nuclear pile inside his body, as seen in &quot;Godfellas&quot;. However, its location and purpose are not clear.

==Personality==
Bender often exhibits sociopathic behavior; he is a pathological liar and rarely shows any empathy (his most frequent catchphrase to any bothersome person is &quot;Bite my shiny metal ass!&quot;). He has a mostly voluntary morality and constantly steals, ranging from the petty theft of wallets to crimes such as kidnapping Jay Leno&#x27;s head and stealing Fry&#x27;s blood and kidney. He also once stole Amy&#x27;s earrings while giving her a hug. It was shown in &quot;Roswell That Ends Well&quot; that even in a disassembled state, his individual limbs carry on attempting to steal anything in proximity; the hand on his dismembered arm steals a wallet out of a scientist&#x27;s pocket before becoming inactive again.

He is shown throughout the series as having a secret desire to be a folk musician that only manifests itself when a magnet is placed on or near his head. This desire is finally fulfilled in the episode &quot;Bendin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;: an accident involving a giant can opener leaves him with a mutilated chest and paralyzed from the neck down. An encounter with Beck during his hospitalization leads to his becoming lead washboard player and the two teaming up for a musical tour that turns Bender into a folk hero for other broken robots, only for his career to end when he finally recovers.
He is also fascinated with cooking, being the chef of the &quot;Planet Express Ship&quot;, though he is shown to have no sense of actual taste. In fact, his early dinners were so horrible that even the omnivorous Zoidberg could not eat it. In his first attempt, he creates a dinner for the crew that is so over-salted they all gag (which is aggravated further when their drinks turn out to be &quot;salt with water in them&quot;); he then remarks that the food was fine since the salt content was 10% below a lethal dose (unfortunately, Zoidberg had seconds). In &quot;The Problem with Popplers&quot;, he creates dinner consisting of nothing but capers and baking soda, and mistakenly expresses his belief that humans eat rocks. He seems to improve his cooking skills over the series, cooking a lavish cake for Nibbler&#x27;s birthday party and beating Elzar for the title of Iron Cook (though he uses a potion called &quot;The Essence of Pure Flavor&quot;, which consists of water and a generous portion of LSD to make the judges hallucinate that his food tastes good). In &quot;Into the Wild Green Yonder&quot;, he mistakenly bakes prison guards a cake with nutmeg thinking it was a natural human sleep drug, before being corrected by Amy that nutmeg is in fact a baking ingredient (nutmeg in high doses will in fact cause psychoactive effects).

As a robot, he possesses an incredible amount of patience. In &quot;Roswell That Ends Well&quot;, he is shown to wait over a thousand years in sand after his head is lost during a trip back in time to 1947, as well as many thousands of years in caverns under New New York City (although on this occasion he was also in the presence of multiple alternate versions of himself that had previously made the same &#x27;trip&#x27;). Despite the long wait, it is implied that Bender does not power down, apparently enjoying his own company so much that he does not consider it necessary. However, in one episode, he shows next to no patience as a one-time joke.

Although the consumption of alcohol is necessitated by Bender&#x27;s design and should not be generally viewed as a vice for alcohol-fueled robots, he apparently drinks far more than he needs for energy. His excessive drinking contributes to his characterization as an alcoholic (&quot;Hell Is Other Robots&quot; reveals that robots can function equally well on mineral oil instead of alcohol, also contributing to the perception of Bender&#x27;s alcohol use as a vice). If he is deprived of alcohol, for instance during periods of depression, he ceases to function properly and shows signs similar to human drunkenness, including developing a rusty five o&#x27;clock shadow. As noted above, his disembodied head has survived for millennia with, presumably, no source of alcohol, so it may be that, when a mere head, Bender neither requires alcohol nor suffers from its absence.

When he is sufficiently frightened or sickened, bricks fall from his backside (a reference to the slang &quot;shitting bricks&quot;). When sufficiently fascinated by something, he may pull out a camera and snap a picture, adding the catchphrase &quot;Neat!&quot;. He has also been shown to be able to use his eyes as cameras. In addition to drinking, he also has an affinity for cigars, which he ignites with a lighter built into his finger, although in &quot;Decision 3012&quot; he uses a Zippo. Unlike drinking alcohol for fuel, Bender tells Fry that he smokes cigars simply because they &quot;make [him] look cool&quot;.

Despite being a robot, he has been seen to show emotion on many occasions, even shedding a tear in &quot;Crimes of the Hot&quot;. One of the series&#x27; running jokes revolves around Bender having emotions, when technically he should be an unfeeling machine. Bender is seemingly unaware of his emotions, stating in the episode &quot;Anthology of Interest II&quot;, &quot;I mean, being a robot&#x27;s great, but we don&#x27;t have emotions, and sometimes that makes me very sad&quot;. In his very first appearance, he tries to commit suicide via a suicide booth out of guilt for having unknowingly contributed to their creation. He has also been known to be nonchalant to the point of appearing both uncaring and incredibly brave, even in life-threatening situations.

Bender is a classic narcissist. He considers himself flawless, a &quot;towering inferno of physical perfection&quot;, and refers to himself in both the first and third person. In &quot;The Farnsworth Parabox&quot; Bender seemingly falls in love with an alternate gold-plated version of himself, stating that he has finally found someone &quot;as great as me&quot;. Even his personal email address, bender@ilovebender.com, reflects his self-absorption.

Despite these human characteristics, he has no verifiable soul, as seen in &quot;Obsoletely Fabulous&quot; when he passes through a &quot;soul detector&quot; without setting off the alarm. However, in &quot;Ghost in the Machines&quot;, Bender becomes a ghost who can&#x27;t interact with people directly but can possess machinery: he uses this ability to &quot;scare Fry to death&quot;. He eventually makes a deal with the Robot Devil (Dan Castellaneta) to get a new body.

His relationships with the rest of the crew of Planet Express vary over time, although he treats nearly all biological organisms with disdain. The only one of his friends who he has openly shown affection for is Fry, his best friend and roommate. &quot;Of all the friends I&#x27;ve had, [he is] the first.&quot; Although he is verbally and physically abusive towards Fry and considers him to be vastly inferior to him, he has been shown to care for him a great deal. In &quot;Jurassic Bark&quot; he states that he loves Fry &quot;the way a human loves a dog, or the way a gorilla loves a kitty&quot;, and in &quot;I Second That Emotion&quot; when Bender gets jealous of Leela’s pet Nibbler and flushes him down the toilet, a distraught Leela asks how he would feel if she did the same to Fry, describing Fry as Bender&#x27;s pet (Bender responds with an apathetic &quot;Only one way to find out.&quot;). He routinely takes advantage of his friends, including framing them for crimes, robbing them, stealing Fry&#x27;s blood on more than one occasion, stealing Fry&#x27;s power of attorney, using Fry&#x27;s body to smash open a window, taking Fry&#x27;s kidney and trying to sell it (it eventually gets eaten by Leela), and stealing jewelry from Amy. He is prone to using the ship’s doctor, Zoidberg, in various get-rich-quick schemes, although it is probable he does not consider Dr. Zoidberg a friend, since in &quot;Obsoletely Fabulous&quot; Bender begged the 1X Robot to &quot;save (his) friends, and Zoidberg&quot; (Though it is seen that he helps Zoidberg from time to time, as seen in &quot;That&#x27;s Lobstertainment!&quot;). He even betrays Leela to Zapp Brannigan in &quot;Into the Wild Green Yonder&quot; when she becomes a wanted criminal, out of jealousy of her steadily growing rap sheet, only to break her out of prison again to ensure his own sheet remains lengthier. Although he regularly frustrates the crew, they have demonstrated a certain affection for him in return. During &quot;How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back&quot;, the entire crew travels to the Central Bureaucracy to recover Bender’s brain after Morgan Proctor burned it onto a floppy disk and sent it away. Hermes Conrad (Phil LaMarr) subsequently risks his bureaucratic license to locate the disc with Bender&#x27;s brain on it by sorting the entire pile in just under four minutes. In the same episode, when Amy asked why they had to fix him, after being met with a brief period of uncertain silence, Leela says, &quot;Those arguments aside, we&#x27;re still going.&quot; Amy and Bender date for a time in &quot;Proposition Infinity&quot;; the relationship becomes so serious that Bender proposes to Amy and participates in a campaign to legalize human/robot marriage, although the relationship ends after he realizes that such marriage rights would necessitate monogamy.

Despite his often immoral attitude, he has a softer side; he can feel guilt and remorse over his actions if he goes too far (even by his own standards), indicating that he is not as selfish or unkind as he appears to be. In &quot;Bendless Love&quot;, Bender intends to murder Flexo in order to win the love of fem-bot Angelyne, but when Flexo gets stuck under a gigantic steel girder, Angelyne shows sorrow for him. Bender decides that her happiness is more important than his own, and ends up saving Flexo. Also, in &quot;Jurassic Bark&quot;, when Bender becomes jealous of Fry&#x27;s petrified dog, Seymour, he decides to throw him in magma. But when he realizes how his actions hurt Fry, Bender apologizes for his behavior and rescues the dog. In &quot;Godfellas&quot;, he becomes the god of a microscopic alien race and abuses this position by commanding them to produce beer for him. When his abuse of power causes the entire species&#x27; demise, however, he cries in mourning and remorse.

==Reception and cultural influence==

In 2008, Bender took second place behind the Terminator in a poll for the &quot;Baddest Movie Robot&quot; on Techradar.com.

The song &quot;Bend It Like Bender!&quot; from the Devin Townsend Project album &quot;Addicted&quot;, is a direct reference to Bender. One of the lyrics in the song is &quot;Game&#x27;s over, losers! I have all the money!&quot;, which is a line Bender says in the episode &quot;A Head in the Polls&quot;.

===Appearances in other media===
Being the show&#x27;s breakout character, Bender has made several cameos in different episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, another series by Matt Groening. Within &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Bender has appeared in episodes &quot;Future-Drama&quot;, &quot;Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Replaceable You&quot;. Bender, along with Professor Farnsworth and Fry, also makes a cameo appearance in Matt Groening&#x27;s latest series &quot;Disenchantment&quot;, in the episode &quot;Dreamland Falls&quot; as a hologram from a crystal ball, within the one-way time machine from the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;The Late Philip J. Fry&quot;.

In the &quot;Simpsons&quot;-&quot;Futurama&quot; crossover episode &quot;Simpsorama&quot;, Bender travels back in time in the 21st century to Springfield to kill Homer Simpson, whose DNA is tied to the creatures rampaging in the 31st century. Bender ends up befriending Homer before learning that the creatures are in fact Bart&#x27;s genetic offspring. Once the crisis is averted, Bender goes into shutdown mode in the Simpsons&#x27; basement. Bender was still resting inert in the Simpsons&#x27; basement as of 2015 episode &quot;Cue Detective&quot; in which his empty body cavity was used to store the family&#x27;s cash nest-egg. Bender also makes a background cameo appearance in the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;My Fare Lady&quot;, holding a shovel and bucket at the end of Homer&#x27;s dream about &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. Bender briefly appears in the episode &quot;Simprovised&quot; holding a sign that says &quot;Bring Back Futurama Again&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Real Veal / Celebrity Wife Swamp&quot; of the TV show &quot;Mad&quot;, Bender makes a cameo appearance in the segment &quot;Real Veal&quot;, a parody of the 2011 film &quot;Real Steel&quot;. He is seen in a robot boxing championship losing to &quot;Real Veal&quot;, a robot-cow hybrid.

He also appears as one of the enemies, along with Doctor Zoidberg, in &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot;.

Bender&#x27;s head is featured in the background of the level &quot;Clockwork Factory&quot; in the tower defense video game, &quot;Kingdom Rush: Vengeance&quot;.

Bender makes cameo appearances in several &quot;Family Guy&quot; episodes. In &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, he can be seen at the Mos Eisley cantina, and in &quot;The Splendid Source&quot;, he is one of the repeaters of a dirty joke whose original author Peter Griffin, Joe Swanson, and Glenn Quagmire are seeking. In the episode &quot;Boopa-dee Bappa-dee&quot;, Peter attempts to use the guide on the television remote, turning Stewie Griffin into a host of past and present Animation Domination characters, including Bender. In &quot;Throw It Away&quot;, Lois Griffin drags Stewie&#x27;s time machine down the stairs which takes them to, in order, the 1950s, the 18th century, the future, with Chris Griffin replaced by Bender, and the prehistory.

<text>Ingeo is a range of polylactic acid (PLA) biopolymers owned by NatureWorks. Resinex Group distributes Ingeo in Europe.

Ingeo is created using carbon stored in plants via photosynthesis and takes the form of dextrose sugar. These sugars are then converted into a biopolymer through the processes of fermentation and separation. The resulting resin can then be injection molded into plastic goods, extruded for film applications, thermoformed into packaging, or extruded for use in textiles. However, its use in textiles is limited because of its limited comfort properties. Due to its biodegradability, PLA is applied in geotextiles, where the objective is that the material over time disappears.

PLA is more resistant to ultraviolet light than some synthetic plastics and has relatively low flammability. Due to its relatively higher hydrophobic character compared to the common polyester fibers, Ingeo is often blended with cotton and wool. This blend of materials results in lighter garments that can repel more moisture. PLA can be disposed of in the biological waste stream. In addition, like most polyesters, it can be recycled. 

Ingeo is also used in packaging and plastic bottles. Its appearance can range from clear to opaque, and it can be flexible or rigid. The biopolymer is similar to polystyrene in exhibiting tensile strength and modulus comparable to hydrocarbon-based thermoplastics. Much like polyester, it resists grease and oil. Similarly, it also offers a flavor and odor barrier. Ingeo provides heat seal-ability at temperatures equivalent to those of polyolefin sealant resins.

<text>Tonbridge ( ) (historic spelling Tunbridge) is a market town in Kent, England, on the River Medway, north of Royal Tunbridge Wells, south west of Maidstone and south east of London. In the administrative borough of Tonbridge and Malling, it had an estimated population of 41,293 in 2019.

==History==
The town was recorded in Domesday Book 1086 as &quot;Tonebrige&quot;, which may indicate a bridge belonging to the estate or manor (from the Old English tun), or alternatively a bridge belonging to Tunna, a common Anglo-Saxon man&#x27;s name. Another theory suggests that the name is a contraction of &quot;town of bridges&quot;, due to the large number of streams the High Street originally crossed.

Until 1870, the town&#x27;s name was spelt &quot;Tunbridge&quot;, as shown on old maps including the 1871 Ordnance Survey map and contemporary issues of the Bradshaw railway guide. In 1870, this was changed to &quot;Tonbridge&quot; by the GPO due to confusion with nearby Tunbridge Wells, despite Tonbridge being a much older settlement. Tunbridge Wells has always maintained the same spelling.

===Normans and Tonbridge Castle===

Tonbridge stands on a spur of higher land where the marshy River Medway could be more easily forded. Ancient trackways converged at this point . There is no record of any bridge before 1191. For much of its existence, the town remained to the north of the river, since the land to the south was subject to extensive seasonal flooding. One part of the town is called &#x27;Dryhill&#x27;. Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare founded the Priory of St Mary Magdalene in 1124.

A motte and bailey castle was built here in the 11th century by Richard Fitz Gilbert, son of the murdered guardian of the infant William the Conqueror. Richard was responsible for governing England in William I&#x27;s many absences.

The town was besieged by William Rufus, soon after his accession to the throne, because the Earl had pledged allegiance to William&#x27;s brother, Robert. William Rufus died from an arrow wound a few years later, in an incident generally reported as a hunting accident, when he was shot by Walter Tirel, Richard Fitz Gilbert&#x27;s son-in-law, &amp; born in Tonbridge himself.

===Medieval===
The town was soon afterwards taken again, this time by King John only a few months after the signing of the Magna Carta. Both the Earl and his son were signatories and guardians of the document responsible for its compliance. It was subsequently besieged by Prince Edward, son of Henry III. On this occasion the besieged garrison burnt the town rather than see it fall. The town and Tonbridge Castle were rebuilt after this and in the 13th century became an official residence and records repository of Edward II.

In later medieval times, Tonbridge was considered an important strategic settlement. Some evidence shows Henry III intended it to be a walled town, and a charter was issued allowing for walls to be built, a market to be held, court sessions to be held and two members from the town to attend parliament. The walls were never built, perhaps because the castle&#x27;s large outer bailey could have easily accommodated the townspeople in times of strife. A surrounding bank and ditch known as &quot;The Fosse&quot; was erected. Today only traces of this encircling defence now remain. The historic core of the town still contains a large number of working buildings dating from the 15th century: the oldest is Port Reeves in East Street.

Tonbridge School, the famous public school, was established in 1552 under letters patent of Edward VI, to educate the sons of local gentry and farmers (There was already a nearby school in existence for poorer boys, now Sevenoaks School.)

During Queen Mary&#x27;s reign Tonbridge was involved in an unsuccessful uprising against the Queen&#x27;s marriage to the King of Spain, with 500 townspeople involved in the Battle of Hartley in 1554. As a result, the town was chosen for a place of execution of a number of Protestants; and in 1555 James Tutty and Margery Polley were burned at the stake in the town and Joan Beach met the same fate in 1556 at Rochester. A memorial to Margery Polly is on the green at Pembury.

===17th and 18th centuries===
During the Civil War, the town was garrisoned by the Parliamentarian side who refortified the castle. Royalist sympathisers made several attempts to take the town but were repulsed.

In 1740 an Act of Parliament was passed to make the River Medway navigable to Tonbridge by the Medway Navigation Company, allowing such materials as coal and lime to be transported to the town, and gunpowder, hops and timber to be carried downriver to Maidstone and the Thames. For a hundred years the Medway Navigation Company was highly profitable, paying out good dividends to its investors, but after the arrival of the railway in 1842 the company went into a steep decline and all commercial traffic ceased in 1911 when the company collapsed. Some of the original warehouses and the wharves are still recognisable today, downstream of the town&#x27;s main bridge.

Later, the town and its surroundings became famous for the production of finely inlaid wooden cabinets, boxes and other objects called Tunbridgeware, which were sold to tourists who were taking the waters at the nearby springs at Tunbridge Wells. Another speciality in the town was until recently the production of cricket balls (the original cricket ball factory in Preston Road was demolished in 2012 to make way for housing) and other sports goods. The Corn Exchange in Bank Street, which was originally conceived as a chapel, dates from 1790.

===19th century to present===

During the March 1880 parliamentary election, Tonbridge was the scene of a riot. On the announcement of the results, several thousand people started to hurl stones and cobbles at each other in the High Street near the Rose and Crown Hotel. The county&#x27;s Chief Constable Captain Ruskin, with over a hundred policemen, charged the crowds many times during the evening, only to end up as the target of the crowd, who started hurling stones and cobbles at them instead of each other. Many people, including twelve policemen, were seriously injured before the crowd finally dispersed at midnight.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s first speeding fine was handed out by Tonbridge Petty Sessions court in 1896. The guilty driver was a Mr Walter Arnold of East Peckham, who was fined one shilling for speeding at in a zone in Paddock Wood, in his Karl Benz powered car. Mr Arnold was apprehended by a policeman who had given chase on his bicycle.

During World War II a prisoner of war camp was built at the junction of Tudeley Lane and Pembury Road on land belonging to Somerhill House. It held German pilots who had been shot down, and captured Italian soldiers. After the war the camp was used as temporary housing for people made homeless by the Blitz. The site is now occupied by the Weald of Kent Girls&#x27; Grammar School.

Ruth Ellis, the last woman in the United Kingdom to be hanged, was married at the registry office in Tonbridge on 8 November 1950.

===Securitas depot robbery===

Tonbridge was the location of the largest cash theft in British criminal history. On 22 February 2006, over £53.1 million was stolen from the Securitas cash-handling depot in Vale Road to the east of the High Street. During the following police investigation, around half of the money was recovered. On 28 January 2008 five people were convicted at the Old Bailey.

==Governance==
Tonbridge is in the county of Kent. After the Norman Conquest Richard fitz Gilbert acquired Tonbridge and the surrounding area, this district being known as the Lowy of Tunbridge. The lowy covered the approximate area of the later parishes of Tonbridge, Tonbridge Rural, Southborough, Hildenborough and Hadlow. The separate administration of the lowy continued until at least the 14th century, after which it became regarded in a similar way to the other hundreds of the county. In the 1894 local government reforms Tonbridge and Southborough became urban districts and the rest of the area became part of Tonbridge Rural District.

Since 1974 the town has been part of the local government district of Tonbridge and Malling, and is divided into the five local government wards of Cage Green and Angel, Castle, Higham, Judd, Trench and Vauxhall. These wards have 12 of the 48 seats on the Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council. As of May 2023, 6 of these seats were held by the Green Party, 3 by the Lib Dems and 3 by the once-dominant Conservatives. Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council is responsible for running local services, such as recreation, refuse collection and council housing; while Kent County Council is responsible for education, social services and trading standards. Both councils are involved in town planning and road maintenance.

Tonbridge is in the parliamentary constituency of Tonbridge.

==Geography and environment==
The town&#x27;s development is shaped by the Medway valley and the railway lines, with development forming a rough &#x27;hourglass&#x27; shape centred on the river and the castle. The residential areas north of the town centre include the mostly post-war Trench Wood and Cage Green (north of the town centre) and Higham Wood (north east). Areas in the south part of the town include the estates off Brook Street which have Radburn layouts (south west), the Victorian railway terraces around Douglas Road and Barden Park, and Vauxhall (to the south east).

In 2014 the Angel Community Garden was created to eliminate eyesores in the area, and encourage bees which are declining. The garden was put along the edge of Sainsbury&#x27;s car park. It was formed in collaboration with Tonbridge Friends of the Earth and Tonbridge &amp; Malling Borough Council. The project also received some support from some local shopkeepers and residents.

===Flooding===
Parts of Tonbridge are at risk of flooding. Significant flooding occurred in 1968, which led to the construction of the Leigh Barrier; and in 2013 which resulted in the Environment Agency building a 320-metre long flood defence along Avebury Avenue in 2015. Despite these measures, significant flooding occurred again in December 2019. The area to the west is retained as floodplain including Tonbridge Park.

===Climate===
Tonbridge experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), like all of Kent, and similar to almost all of the United Kingdom. Temperatures all year round are mild, with a low amount of precipitation. Snow sometimes occurs in the winter. On 22 July 1868, the temperature was supposed to have reached , the British record until 2003. However, this temperature was later rejected as being around too high.

==Economy==

Major industries include light engineering, printing and publishing, distribution and financial services. Tonbridge, together with its neighbour Tunbridge Wells, has been designated by the South East Assembly as a Regional Hub.

The town has largely retained its &#x27;market town&#x27; atmosphere and has many attractions to visitors and residents alike. Sports facilities including an indoor/outdoor swimming pool, a leisure centre and a large sports ground are all located close to the town centre. Many of the facilities are provided or subsidised by the local authority.

Most of the town&#x27;s shopping facilities are concentrated on the High Street, which runs for about through the town centre. The high street has a variety of bars, restaurants, estate agents, clothes shops, hairdressers, banks, charity shops, cafes, bakers, a butchers and a fishmongers. There are relatively few empty high street premises compared to the mid-1990s, reflecting the town&#x27;s increasing prosperity. There are relatively few high street chain stores that have tended to move to large shopping centres such as Tunbridge Wells, Maidstone and Bluewater, although there are some major retail outlets a short walk from the High Street along Canon Lane, on the outskirts of the town. The Borough Council has published proposals to improve the town&#x27;s shopping and leisure facilities.

During the early 20th century Tonbridge became the South East hub for plastic moulding / engineering and printing, with many well-known companies such as The Crystalate Gramophone Record Company, which claimed to be the oldest record producer in Britain. They bought out The Vocalion Gramophone Company in 1932 when the principal labels included Rex, Nine-Inch Broadcast, and Ten-Inch Broadcast. From the early post-war years, Crystalate was very much involved in producing the 1 mini-disc, which was sold in Marks &amp; Spencers, Woolworths and probably other stores for 6d (2.5p) each between 1930 and 1937, with labels such as Crown, Embassy and Eclipse. In 1937, Crystalate was absorbed by Decca, which was itself purchased by Polygram (Philips). Some manufacturing still remains in Tonbridge: Enalon Limited, founded in 1946, is the last remaining plastic moulder and toolmaker based in the town.
In 1999, Harvester Trust Tonbridge bought a derelict site on Medway Wharf Road, in the centre of Tonbridge. A£4 million building which can be used as a church, community centre and conference centre was given planning permission in March 2000. Work began in 2001. The River Centre was officially opened in January 2003, and hosted a wide variety of events from product launches to awards ceremonies, as well as international church conferences. In August 2016, Hillsong Church purchased the building and is the current owner.

The police station, on Pembury Road, was previously the headquarters of the West Kent Police Division, prior to the West Division being again headquartered at Maidstone.

Royal Mail&#x27;s TN postcode main sorting office is located on Vale Road in the town.

Tonbridge is also the location of Carroty Wood, an outdoor activity and residential centre run by Rock UK, offering groups of young people the opportunity to try out a variety of outdoor activities.

A former oast house on the road to Hildenborough has been converted to a small theatre called the Oast Theatre.

Tonbridge Medical Group built a substantial new medical centre in 2020 to replace their ageing Pembury Road and Higham Lane sites.

==Transport==

Tonbridge railway station is one of Kent&#x27;s busiest with 4.1 million passengers using it each year. It is an important railway junction with lines to London, Ashford, Hastings and Redhill. The town is also served by the A21 trunk road between London and Hastings and the A26 between Maidstone and Brighton. It is also close to the M25 motorway.

Before World War I, aviation pioneers Frank Gooden and Richard Johnson tried to establish an airfield to the north of Tonbridge at Cage Green Fields, at the top of the ridge which The Ridgeway ascends, and east of Shipbourne Road. An accident is recorded as having occurred on 24 December 1913 at the airfield, although neither Gooden or Johnson was injured. The scheme was ended by the outbreak of war.

<doc id="341105" wikidata="Q3896732" url="?curid=341105" title="Communist Party of New Zealand">
<text>The Communist Party of New Zealand (CPNZ) was a communist party in New Zealand which existed from 1921 to 1994. Although spurred to life by events in Soviet Russia in the aftermath of World War I, the party had roots in pre-existing revolutionary socialist and syndicalist organisations, including in particular the independent Wellington Socialist Party, supporters of the Industrial Workers of the World in the Auckland region, and a network of impossiblist study groups of miners on the west coast of the South Island.

Never high on the list of priorities of the Communist International, the CPNZ was considered an appendage of the Communist Party of Australia until 1928, when it began to function as a fully independent party. Party membership remained small, only briefly topping the 1,000 mark, with its members subjected to government repression and isolated by expulsions from the mainstream labour movement concentrated in the New Zealand Labour Party.

During the period of the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s, the CPNZ sided with the Chinese Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong. The party splintered into a multiplicity of tiny political parties after 1966 and no longer exists as an independent group.

==History==

===Background===
As the 20th Century dawned, New Zealand was recognised by adherents of International Socialism around the globe as a sort of laboratory test case of social democratic government in practice. One June 1901 pamphlet put to print by J. A. Wayland, proprietor of the mass circulation socialist weekly &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, detailed the ways in which the island nation of 720,000 had already passed extensive legislation for the benefit of wage workers, backed by 200 agents of the &quot;Labour Intelligence Department&quot;. While the country was declared &quot;no Utopia&quot;, New Zealand nevertheless was said to have &quot;no real want&quot; and &quot;no unemployment problem to solve&quot;. Instead trade unions were not merely formally recognised but were pervasive and had managed to mitigate the class struggle through arbitration laws sanctioned by law, with disputes decided by three member courts of arbitration, each including representatives of capital, labour, and the courts as provided in the 1894 Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

An extensive system of public works were in existence, governed by the principle of &quot;fair work and fair pay.&quot; More than 200 employment bureaus dotted the country, connecting every willing worker with a job. Sweatshops were banned, as was systematic home manufacturing, with mandatory labelling of all products made outside of factories. Wages were generally high and the 48-hour week said to be a local maximum. The presence of &quot;tramps&quot; had been eliminated through town allotments of small homesteads to poor workers, granted through easily affordable perpetual leases. The power of eminent domain had been assumed by the New Zealand parliament in 1896, allowing the state to assume ownership of large estates at their assessed price for division into small farms.

State finance had been accomplished by a tax on land values and the establishment of a progressive income tax. The national government itself owned and operated the railways, telegraph and telephone systems, schools, and postal savings banks throughout the country even before the landmark election of 1891. Workers&#x27; compensation insurance to protect against injury was required by law, and low cost life insurance had been provided by the state since 1869. Old age pensions were provided to all New Zealanders 65 years of age or older who had been resident in the country for at least 25 years.

&quot;The New Zealanders are collectivists, although they adhere to the old party names of liberals and tories,&quot; the American examiners enthused, with the New Zealand Liberal Party reckoned as equivalent to the Fabian socialists of Great Britain. Richard Seddon (1845–1906), Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1893 until his death in 1906, oversaw implementation of an array of social welfare programs as leader of the Liberal Government

This idyllic vision – which incidentally paid no attention to the treatment of or conditions endured by the indigenous Polynesian population – proved to be short-lived. With the eruption of World War I in 1914, New Zealand sent soldiers to Allied campaigns in Turkey, Palestine, and France and Flanders. Over 120,000 New Zealanders were enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, with about 100,000 men and women eventually serving as soldiers and nurses in Europe, out of a population of 1.14 million. Of these, about 18,000 were killed in battle and another 41,000 felled by wounds or disease – a casualty rate approaching 60%. Conscription was introduced in 1916, with the stream of volunteer enthusiasts exhausted. As casualties continued to mount into 1917, public war-weariness set in, fuelling political discontent. A revolutionary socialist movement began to emerge.

===Establishment===
There were isolated reflections of international radical tendencies present in New Zealand from shortly after the turn of the 20th century. The New Zealand Socialist Party (NZSP), founded in 1901, included in its ranks a left wing which eschewed political action, arguing that socialism could only be won by the direct efforts of the organised working class acting through their unions.

Others adhered to the theories of Daniel DeLeon, which advocated the use of the ballot box for a revolutionary transformation of society leading to a socialist state governed by revolutionary industrial unions. From 1911, the ideas of syndicalism began to gain a foothold in the Auckland area under the banner of the Industrial Workers of the World, while the anti-political impossibilist ideas of the Socialist Party of Great Britain made their mark upon others. All of these tendencies would contribute adherents to the pioneer New Zealand communist movement.

Particularly worthy of note were a small network of Marxist study circles were formed during the wartime years, concentrated mainly in the small mining communities of the South Island. Wartime violence and the 1917 October Revolution in Russia proved a stimulant to revolutionary ideas, drawing members to these groups, leading to their formal affiliation during the summer Christmas holiday of 1918 as the New Zealand Marxian Association (NZMA). This group electing T. W. Feary as secretary of the organisation and in 1919 dispatched him and two others to North America to gain additional information on the revolutionary movement through the American and Canadian prism.

Visiting the Pacific Coast cities of San Francisco and Vancouver, Feary and his co-thinkers obtained copies of a number of influential publications, including &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot;, a participant&#x27;s account of the October Revolution by John Reed, and &quot;The Soviets at Work&quot;, a widely reprinted pamphlet by Vladimir Lenin. These were successfully smuggled back to New Zealand, with the Lenin tract immediately put into print in yet another new edition.

Adding to the complexity of the fragmented radical movement was the Wellington Socialist Party, formerly a branch of the NZSP which had split with the national organisation in 1913 over the issue of electoral politics. While the main body of the NZSP had gone on to found the New Zealand Labour Party in 1916, the Wellington Socialist Party believed in direct action and use of the general strike for the intended overthrow of capitalism and had forced a split. Suffering attenuation but surviving the war, this Wellington organisation would constitute the main component of the new Communist Party of New Zealand.

By 1921, sentiment had begun to build for the establishment of a communist political party along those lines advocated by the fledgling Communist International. A preparatory conference was called for Easter weekend, 26–27 March 1921, in Wellington. This preliminary gathering was followed with a formal organisational conference held on Saturday, 9 April, at Wellington Socialist Hall – headquarters of the Wellington Socialist Party – at which time the Communist Party of New Zealand (CPNZ) was formally established.

Of the origins of the Communist Party, historian Kerry Taylor writes:

&quot;The foundation of the CPNZ will always remain shrouded in a degree of mystery. No direct record of the event survives — the minutes have long since been lost and no reports appeared in the media at the time... The precise nature of the discussion and debate is obscure but the delegates had before them the constitution of the Communist Party of Australia and a draft manifesto and constitution drawn up over the previous few months by members of the Wellington Socialist Party.&quot;

E. J. Dyer of the capital city was elected as the first secretary of the new organisation.

===Early years===
In contrast to demographic findings made of the early Communist Party of America, for example, the communist movement in New Zealand was never dominated by Slavic, Scandinavian, and Jewish emigrants from the former Russian empire, with one academic study showing that a big majority of the movement&#x27;s participants during the decade of the 1920s were either native New Zealanders by birth or first-generation immigrants from England, Scotland, Ireland, or Wales.

The CPNZ participated in elections for the first time in 1923, with its inaugural candidate drawing an impressive 2,128 votes in a race for election to the Dunedin city council.

Unable to take over the newspaper of the Federation of Labour, the &quot;Maoriland Worker&quot;, in 1924 the CPNZ established its own official publication, &quot;The Communist&quot;, published in Auckland. Despite the establishment of this new central organ, the organisation remained highly decentralised in its formative years, with branches operating in virtual isolation and the small movement failing to achieve critical mass. A conference was consequently held during the 1924 Christmas break, attended by delegates of the Communist Party of Australia (Hetty and Hector Ross), at which it was decided to make the CPNZ a subordinate section of the larger Australian party. Harry Quaife from Australia also visited in 1925, and had &quot;some success in putting Auckland communists on a more unified footing&quot;.

This situation continued through all of 1925, only ending the year after following a six-month organising tour by Australian activist Norman Jeffrey, a bow-tie wearing former &quot;Wobbly&quot; (IWW member). In April 1926 a new monthly magazine was launched for the New Zealand communist movement, &quot;The Workers&#x27; Vanguard&quot;, published in the isolated inland mining town of Blackball, located on the rainy West Coast side of the South Island. A return to independence of the New Zealand party shortly followed and by the end of 1926 headquarters of the CPNZ were moved from Wellington to Blackball. They would remain there until returned to the North Island and the capital city in 1928.

Total membership of the party remained tiny in this period, with the CPNZ counting fewer than 100 members. Despite its small size, the party nevertheless managed to exert a degree of influence within the national Miners&#x27; and Seamen&#x27;s Unions.

The party did not operate in a vacuum but was rather the object of official scrutiny from the start with the New Zealand Police and New Zealand Army both engaged in the systematic monitoring of radical activists, including those suspected of &quot;using their influence to establish Bolshevism.&quot;

===Third Period (1928–1935)=== 
Previously considered an insignificant adjunct of the Communist Party of Australia in the eyes of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI), early in 1928 the CPNZ received a cable from Moscow requesting that the party dispatch a delegate to the forthcoming 6th World Congress of the Comintern. Twenty-eight-year-old Wellington activist Dick Griffin, a member of the Seamen&#x27;s Union, was chosen as the party&#x27;s first-ever delegate to a Comintern gathering in Moscow. Griffin travelled circuitously to the Soviet Union, with his ocean voyage going first to Australia before heading to Great Britain via the Suez Canal. British authorities were aware of his presence by the time he arrived, detaining him for questioning and seizing documents, but Griffin was allowed to depart in time to reach Moscow prior to 17 July opening of the World Congress.

The 6th Congress of the Comintern is remembered for its launch of the ultra-radical analysis and tactics of the so-called Third Period, which posited the rapid decay of capitalism and the acceleration of the class struggle and coming of potential revolutionary situations. While in many countries this meant directives to immediately shatter joint work with social democratic political and trade union leaders, the Comintern&#x27;s &quot;Resolution on the Tasks of the Communist Party of New Zealand,&quot; brought back to Wellington by Griffin, maintained that New Zealand was still marked by &quot;the steady upward swing of capitalist development, combined with relatively good conditions for the workers,&quot; thereby serving to &quot;prevent the possibility of a general revolutionary situation in New Zealand.&quot; Instead of consolidating itself for an envisioned revolutionary uprising, the CPNZ was directed to concentrate its attention on continued agitation and propaganda.

Dick Griffin became the first full-time organiser of the CPNZ in May 1929. In August of that same year he assumed the role of General Secretary of the organisation.

It was only in March 1930 that the CPNZ received a communication from ECCI directing it to take on ultra-radical policies in accord the Third Period analysis. The party&#x27;s previous policies were deemed incorrect and the CPNZ was instructed to attempt to assume leadership of the New Zealand workers movement by working to &quot;expose and destroy all the Labourite, pacifist, social democratic illusions about the possibility of solving social problems...under the existing political and economic regime.&quot; This marked the actual beginning of sectarian Third Period tactics in New Zealand.

The CPNZ was beset by rapid membership turnover throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, with general secretary Griffin accused of operating a personal dictatorship, spurring rank-and-file discontent. The CPNZ was also subjected to unrelenting police operations by the national government, including a July 1929 raid which seized the internal records and literature of the Wellington branch and the subsequent successful prosecution of five members of the governing Central Executive Committee for possession and sale of allegedly seditious literature. Party leaders were particularly targeted, with three more members of the Central Executive Committee arrested in 1930, four more in 1931 and 1932, and all seven members in 1933.

The party was further disorganised by the churn of its rank-and-file members in and out of the party, exemplified by the count of Wellington members booming from 51 in March to 80 by May 1931 before plummeting to just 25 in January 1932. Things grew so bad that by October 1932 only one member of the Central Executive Committee had been a member of the party for longer than a year, with some members for as little as two months. The party was impoverished, its coffers drained both by the cost of producing the &quot;Red Worker&quot; (rival publication to the mainstream trade unionist &quot;Maoriland Worker),&quot; and by courtroom losses in several libel cases brought against that publication. Party publications were carefully scrutinised, with two issues of the &quot;Red Worker&quot; and a pamphlet found to be seditious in 1932 and those responsible for their publication jailed for more than a year.

The CPNZ also lost its influence in the country&#x27;s trade unions during the late 1920s and early 1930s owing to its rigid support for unpopular secondary strikes in solidarity with workers in other countries. This was epitomised by a 1929 call for a miners&#x27; strike in sympathy with mine and timber workers in Australia, which annihilated party influence among the miners of the South Island&#x27;s West Coast and 1931 efforts to blackball a Japanese ship, which led to discord and alienation from the party in the Seamen&#x27;s Union.

===&quot;Freemanisation&quot;===
By the middle of 1933, the Communist Party of New Zealand was in crisis, with its entire Central Committee jailed for publication of the pamphlet &quot;Karl Marx and the Struggle of the Masses.&quot; The New Zealand-born Fred Freeman was returned to the country to assume the position of general secretary following four years in Moscow at the service of the Comintern. More politically astute and organisationally adroit than Griffin, Freeman promoted university graduates Clement Gordon Watson and his friend Elsie Farrelly, to positions of party leadership, where they were joined by party veteran Ernie Brooks. This group of four would dominate CPNZ politics through the end of 1935.

The operations of the CPNZ came to resemble those of larger and more efficient communist parties in other countries, with official directives and circulars issued systematically for the first time by the Central Committee to local party committees. Representatives of the Central Committee also began to travel regularly to visit local party organisations. Dues collecting and record-keeping of branches was made more regular and increased attention was paid to the problem of internal security in an effort to stave the crippling series of arrests that had swept the party.

Comintern policy began to change in 1933 following the victory of the Nazi Party in Germany, leading to eventual advocacy of a so-called Popular Front against fascism by 1935. Under the Freeman leadership the CPNZ took the first tentative steps in this direction late in 1933 when the CPNZ approached the National Executive Committee of the New Zealand Labour Party with a proposal for a joint campaign against fascism. No answer was given. Parallel appeals were made to several key trade unions, including the Miners, Seamen, and Dockworkers, with only the Miners providing a response.

The CPNZ responded to the tacit rejection of their appeal by accelerating their efforts to drive a wedge between the rank and file and leadership of each of these organisations, a tactic euphemistically called the &quot;United Front from Below.&quot; The distrust and alienation between the Communist Party and the Labour Party leadership carried over through the November 1935 general election, during which the CPNZ made use of the slogan &quot;Neither Reaction nor Labour&quot; in the campaign. The 1935 election ultimately resulted in a massive victory for the Labour Party, bringing it to power for the first time, and a grave failure for the CPNZ in its electoral efforts, with all four of the party&#x27;s candidates faring so poorly at the polls that they failed to recover their electoral deposits.

===Popular Front period and World War II===
The Communist Party of New Zealand had shown growth over the years of the Third Period, with the party&#x27;s delegate to the 7th World Congress of the Comintern in Moscow, Leo Sim (pseudonym: Andrews), reporting there that party membership had increased by 600% from 1928 to 1935. The reality was modest, with the party failing to achieve a membership of 400 — results which only were promising when compared to the nadir of the late 1920s.

Dissatisfaction with Freeman&#x27;s commanding leadership style grew in 1935 and 1936 and he landed on the wrong side of the Popular Front-driven Comintern decision that the CPNZ should seek formal affiliation with the Labour Party sooner rather than later. Freeman came to be politically isolated, with the Auckland district of the party, backed by Lance Sharkey of the Communist Party of Australia, leading the charge for his removal as an alleged impediment to the new international line. Freeman was removed from the party leadership late in 1936, suspended from the party soon thereafter for failing to accept this decision, and ultimately expelled late in 1937.

In 1938, CPNZ headquarters were moved from the capital city of Wellington to the booming northern port city of Auckland and a new weekly was launched there in July 1939, &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot;. This headquarter city and official organ would remain constant for the rest of the party&#x27;s institutional life.

In the summer of 1939, the CPNZ came into conflict with the government in the aftermath of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, to which the party responded with anti-war rhetoric while the governments of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union carved up spheres of influence in Europe. Tensions worsened in 1940, when Great Britain came under attack – a country to which New Zealanders felt a particular national affinity. Although membership in the CPNZ remained legal, &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot; was suppressed by the government.

The tide turned in June 1941, following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. At that time, in accord with Soviet foreign policy, the CPNZ became vocal supporters of the war effort, which combined with the country&#x27;s new status of military allies with the Soviet Union paved the way for the New Zealand party&#x27;s growth in membership and influence. By 1945 party membership reached its all-time high of approximately 2,000, while circulation of &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot; topped 14,000 copies per week. This level of membership and support would continue through 1946, when new international circumstances would arise leading to the CPNZ&#x27;s inexorable attrition.

===Post-war era===
The Communist Party stood candidates in general elections from the to the ; particularly in the , the and the ; and in 3 by-elections; Brooklyn , Grey Lynn , and Otahuhu . Candidates stood frequently in the electorate (7 elections) and the electorate (8 elections; often Ronald Smith). The highest vote was 534 for Vic Wilcox in the electorate in the .

The Communist Party experienced the loss of several prominent members including Sid Scott following Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s denunciation of Stalin at the 20th Congress of the CPSU in February 1956 and the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Revolution in November 1956.
As a result of these events, most of the intellectuals the CPNZ had attracted left the party while some erstwhile supporters founded new journals such as &quot;New Zealand Monthly Review&quot;, &quot;Comment&quot;, &quot;Socialist Forum&quot;, and &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot;.

===Sino-Soviet split and factionalism===
Next, in the early 1960s, the party experienced more internal strife due to the Sino-Soviet split. The party was divided between supporters of the Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev and those who claimed Khrushchev was a &quot;revisionist&quot; and chose instead to follow China under Mao Zedong. Subsequently, the CPNZ under the leadership of Victor Wilcox became the first official Communist party in the First World to side with Mao. The majority of the party and its newspaper &quot;The People&#x27;s Voice&quot; adopted Maoism, while supporters of Khrushchev&#x27;s Soviet Union (mainly Auckland trade unionists) split off to form the Socialist Unity Party. The Communist Party also maintained warm ties with the Indonesian Communist Party and supported Indonesia during the Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation (1963–1966). It also condemned the Indonesian mass killings that followed the alleged 30 September coup attempt as a right wing coup.

Later, when Mao died, the Communist Party of New Zealand began to follow the lead of Enver Hoxha&#x27;s Albania, which they considered to be the last truly Communist country in the world. Members of the CPNZ national leadership who continued to uphold the line of the post-Mao Chinese Communist Party including Wilcox were expelled, and formed the Preparatory Committee for the Formation of the Communist Party of New Zealand (Marxist–Leninist).

Meanwhile, other former members of the CPNZ in Wellington, where the party branch had been expelled &quot;en masse&quot; in 1970, founded the Wellington Marxist Leninist Organisation, which in 1980 merged with the Northern Communist Organisation to form the Workers&#x27; Communist League (WCL).

While the CPNZ never had mass influence or real political power, it pursued a Leninist vanguard party approach that involved trying to influence and penetrate the Labour Party, the New Zealand trade union movement, various single-issue protest groups and public opinion on foreign policy, industrial activity, opposition to New Zealand&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War, Māori rights, the anti-Apartheid movement, feminism, and nuclear disarmament, and anti-colonial activism in the Pacific region; issues in which communists and non-communist left-wing elements found common cause.

===Decline and legacy===
After the collapse of communist rule in Albania, the Communist Party of New Zealand gradually changed its views, renouncing its former support of Stalinism, Maoism, and Hoxhaism. Instead, under the leadership of its last general secretary, Grant Morgan, it developed a state capitalist analysis of the Stalinist states. The party now believed that the Soviet Union had never been socialist at all, not even in Stalin&#x27;s time. Opponents of this change departed and established the Communist Party of Aotearoa (a Maoist group) and the Marxist–Leninist Collective (a Hoxhaist group).

The Communist Party of New Zealand eventually merged with the neo-Trotskyist International Socialist Organization on 2 November 1994. The resultant party, known as the Socialist Workers Organization, evolved into the small but highly active Socialist Worker (Aotearoa). However, most of the ISO members split off again and resumed their own organisation. A number of SW members also split from the organisation in 2008 to form Socialist Aotearoa. The SW voted to dissolve itself at its conference in January 2012.

<text>An ersatz food () is a substitute food, especially one that is considered inferior to the food it replaces. It has particular connotations of wartime usage.

==Etymology==
&quot;Ersatz&quot; is a German word meaning &quot;substitute&quot; or &quot;replacement&quot;. Although it is used as an adjective in English, it is a noun in German. In German orthography noun phrases formed are usually represented as a single word, forming compound nouns such as &quot;Ersatzteile&quot; (&quot;spare parts&quot;) or &quot;Ersatzspieler&quot; (&quot;substitute player&quot;). While &quot;ersatz&quot; in English generally means that the substitution is of unsatisfactory or inferior quality compared with the &quot;real thing&quot;, in German, there is no such implication: e.g., &quot;Ersatzteile&quot; &#x27;spare parts&#x27; is a technical expression without any implication about quality, &quot;Kaffeeersatz&quot; &#x27;coffee substitute&#x27; is a drink from something other than coffee beans, and &quot;Ersatzzug&quot; &#x27;replacement train&#x27; performs a comparable service. The term for inferior substitute in German would be &quot;Surrogat&quot;, which is cognate to the English word &quot;surrogate&quot;.

==Historical examples==
===World War I===
In the opening months of World War I, replacement troops for battle-depleted German infantry units were drawn from lesser-trained Ersatz Corps, which were less effective than the troops they replaced.

Another example of the word&#x27;s usage in Germany exists in the German naval construction programs at the beginning of the 20th century. In this context, the phrasing &quot;Ersatz (ship name)&quot; indicates that a new, larger or more capable ship was a replacement for an ageing or lost vessel. Because German practice was not to reveal the name of a new ship until its launch, this meant that the ship was known by its &quot;Ersatz (ship name)&quot; throughout its construction. At the end of World War I, the last three ships of the planned of battlecruisers were redesigned and initially known simply as the , since the first ship was considered to be a replacement for the lost armored cruiser .

The Allied naval blockade of Germany limited maritime commerce with Germany, forcing Germany and Austria-Hungary to develop substitutes for products such as chemical compounds and . More than 11,000 ersatz products were sold in Germany during the war. Patents for ersatz products were granted for 6000 varieties of beer, wine and lemonade; 1000 kinds of soup cubes; 837 types of sausage and 511 assortments of coffee.
&quot;Ersatz&quot; products developed in Germany and Austria-Hungary during this time included:
*synthetic rubber &quot;Kautschuk&quot; produced from petroleum for rubber
*benzene for heating oil (coal gas)
*industrial lubricants made by extracting oils from coal tar and brown-coal slags
*synthetic camphor for imported natural camphor
*nitrate crepe paper made from cellulose for gun cotton
*glycerin from sugar rather than fats
*gypsum-yielded sulphur
*pigeon guano used to make fertilizer
*flowers and weeds processed to make alcohol for ammunition
*rosins and gums extracted from coal derivatives
*tea composed of roasted barley, grasses, wild flowers, ground raspberry leaves or catnip
*coffee substitute using roasted acorns, chicory and beechnuts (stretched with caramel-flavoured raw sugar and beet flower later in the war)
*butter replaced by curdled milk, sugar and food colouring
*cooking oil replaced by a mixture of beets, carrots, turnips and spices
*salad oil was 99% mucilage
*eggs replaced by yellow-coloured corn or potato flour
*ground European beetles (cockchafers) and linden wood replaced fats
*sausage made of water, plant fibres, animal scraps and blood (the infamous &#x27;war sausage&#x27; which was equated to &#x27;a mouthful of sawdust&#x27;)
*bouillon cubes made 70–90% of salt rather than meat extract
*wheat flour stretched by adding potato flour and powdered hay
*chocolates and cocoa replaced by ground cocoa shells and mixed pure pepper
*oil and sunflower &#x27;cakes&#x27; replaced corn and oats as horse feed
*rapeseed, poppy and mustard &#x27;cakes&#x27; replaced green feed for cattle
*paper, peat, reeds, bulrushes and free-growing stinging nettle fibres replaced cotton in textiles
*wood and paper used for shoe soles

Germany also stretched its supply of petrol with &#x27;gasohol&#x27; (&quot;Benzolspiritus&quot;), which by today&#x27;s standards would be classed as E25 petrol, consisting of 75% petrol and 25% distilled alcohol, likely ethanol.

===World War II===
In World War II, &quot;Ersatzbrot&quot; (substitute bread) made of potato starch, frequently stretched with extenders such as sawdust, was furnished to soldiers as &quot;Kommissbrot&quot;, a dark German bread baked from rye and other flours used for military rations, and also to prisoners of war. One recipe reportedly discovered in the &quot;Food Providing Ministry&quot; (&quot;Reichsnährstand&quot;) in Berlin, labeled &quot;(Top Secret) Berlin 24.X1 1941&quot;, contained 50% bruised rye grain, 20% sliced sugar beets, 20% &quot;tree flour&quot; (sawdust), and 10% minced leaves and straw.

During the siege of Leningrad, its citizens were given ersatz flour instead of actual wheat flour (of which there was an extremely limited supply then) by the Soviet authorities. The lack of proper food with any nutrition meant that the city residents not only starved but became vulnerable to deadly illnesses and diseases (such as dysentery) owing to their weakened physical conditions. As a result, the word ersatz entered as a pejorative into Russian and other Slavic languages.

In Britain, this was additionally popularised as an adjective from the experiences of thousands of U.S., British, and other English-speaking combat personnel, primarily airmen, who were captured in the European Theater of Operations during World War II. These Allied prisoners of war were given ersatz goods such as &quot;Ersatzkaffee&quot;, an inferior &quot;Getreidekaffee&quot; or &quot;grain coffee&quot; as a coffee substitute by their German captors.

===Eastern Bloc===
In the Eastern Bloc, many agricultural goods could not be produced domestically, such as tea, coffee, nuts, and citrus fruits. These were generally imported from abroad with scarce foreign currency reserves, or inferior substitutes were produced domestically. In 1977, the East German coffee crisis resulted in the introduction of many coffee substitutes, which were generally rejected by the population. Replacements for orangeat and succade were made from candied carrot and unripe tomatoes.

===Other===
A study of conditions in the Southern United States during the United States Civil War is called &quot;Ersatz in the Confederacy&quot;.

== Effectiveness ==
When presented with a choice of ersatz, one tends to prefer the generic version of the name brand rather than an entirely different product. Specifically one that most closely resembles the original and meets the same goal. 

For instance, a person who desires a gourmet chocolate is more likely to choose another, less expensive chocolate as a substitute than a different kind of dessert or snack. Because such &quot;within-category&quot; substitutes are easier to compare to the desired good, however, those that are inferior are less effective than &quot;cross-category&quot; substitutes that fulfill the same goal. People are more able to notice their inferiority during consumption, which leads them to be less satisfying than goal-derived substitutes from different taxonomic categories.

During the First World War in Germany and Austria-Hungary, people succumbed to sickness from the consumption of ersatz goods. In Austria, the term &quot;Vienna sickness&quot; was coined after malnutrition from such goods was linked to a cause of the tuberculosis epidemic (10,000 reported cases).

In Germany, Princess Blücher suffered from influenza in 1916, suggesting that she was suffering from &quot;ersatz illness&quot;. She writes: &quot;everyone is feeling ill from too many chemicals in the hotel food. I don&#x27;t believe that Germany will ever be starved out, but she will be poisoned out first with these substitutes.&quot;

*Counterfeit
*Giffen good, a good for which there is no ersatz replacement, causing demand to rise with prices

<text>Athens (2016 Population 3,013) is a township in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It is located approximately north of the St. Lawrence River, near Brockville, west of Addison, and about south west of Ottawa. Formerly, it was a part of Yonge township before becoming Rear of Yonge and Escott with Athens as its own census division and finally, Athens township. The township consists of the former village of Athens and a few other small communities.

Formerly known as &quot;Farmersville&quot;, Benoni Wiltse, a United Empire Loyalist, and his brothers settled in the town of Athens in 1792. Farmersville was renamed to Athens in 1888 by Arza Parish in honour of Athens, Greece, because it was an educational centre with grammar school, a model school for teacher training, and a high school. Athens&#x27; post office was named in 1890. Currently, the town of Athens is known for a series of large outdoor murals depicting historical local life, painted on the sides of various buildings.

Each year, a summer fair is held, called &quot;Cornfest&quot;. This fair celebrates the harvest of corn and is held on the 3rd Saturday of August annually. Another celebration that is held each year is called the &quot;Farmersville Exhibition&quot;, and is also known as &quot;Steam Fair.&quot; This fair celebrates the agricultural heritage of the town, and includes steam engines and antique tractors. This takes place in July.

Athens has its own high school Athens District High School, which is under the Upper Canada District School Board, as well as a live entertainment venue Joshua Bates Centre which features a series of live musical performances each year.

== Communities ==
Aside from Athens, the township consists of the communities of: Anoma Lea, Beales Mills, Charleston, Glen Elbe, Glen Morris, Hayes Corners, Wiltsetown. The township administrative offices are located in Athens.

=== Beales Mills ===
Beales Mills, Ontario is a small settlement located southwest of the town of Athens, close to Charleston. The community was settled around the mid-19th century by a Benjamin Beale for whom the settlement was named. Beale established a sawmill, gristmill, and a flour mill along the creek located through the settlement, now known as Beales Creek, as well as a shingle manufacturing business.

The community relied on the nearby hamlet of Charleston for most of its needs, such as a post office, however Charleston relied on Beales Mills to supply water power to most of its businesses. Eventually, around the 1900s, the settlement began to decline as the mills closed. Presently, the site of Beales Mills consists of a few residential buildings most of which are modern. The ruins of a stone mill and dam can still be seen today. The settlement is largely considered a ghost town.

== Cemeteries ==
The township of Athens is home to several old burying grounds or cemeteries. Some of these cemeteries include: Barber Cemetery, an unregistered cemetery in Charleston called Charleston Village Cemetery, Temperance Lake Cemetery, Kincaid&#x27;s Corners Cemetery, Holmes Cemetery, Lake Eloida Cemetery and an abandoned and unnamed pioneer cemetery. In the settlement of Wiltsetown, there is a cemetery called Wiltse Pioneer Cemetery that was established around 1795. Wiltse Pioneer Cemetery holds close to 300 interments, most of which are unmarked or marked by field stones instead of engraved tombstones.

In the town of Athens, there is a Roman Catholic cemetery called St. Denis Roman Catholic Cemetery, as well as a non-denominational community cemetery. The community of Glen Elbe has its own cemetery which is no longer is use, but maintained by its own board. This cemetery dates to around 1840.

East of Athens there is a Quaker cemetery simply called Quaker Cemetery which was established in the 1830s; this cemetery is no longer in use but is maintained by the township. Most of the stones here are badly deteriorated with only two being legible.

East of Athens along Highway 42 is a mass gravesite associated with the House of Industry as it operated from 1895 until 1946 housing the sick, elderly or poor. The gravesite is currently marked by a large stone simply reading &quot;Pioneers of Leeds &amp; Grenville 1895 – 1946&quot;. The original plans for the burial site included space for over 480 individuals in specific areas of the site, however, it is unclear if these plans were ever followed. Over one hundred graves are located here, of those who lived at the House of Industry between the aforementioned years and whose bodies remained unclaimed after death. For many years it was unclear where the graves were precisely located, as absolutely no records were kept and no grave markers were placed at the time. The mass grave became abandoned in 1946 when the House of Industry came under new management, who deemed the burial practices being used as undignified. A plot was then reserved in Glen Elbe cemetery for the unclaimed dead. In recent years, the long-neglected cemetery has been cleaned up and a fence was built around the stone memorial. A cooperative effort between local genealogical societies has recently discovered the approximate boundaries of the burial plot by dowsing for grave sites.

<doc id="341111" wikidata="Q19617380" url="?curid=341111" title="List of islands in the Pacific Ocean">
<text>The Pacific islands are a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. They are further categorized into three major island groups: Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Depending on the context, the term &quot;Pacific Islands&quot; may refer to one of several different concepts: (1) those countries and islands with common Austronesian origins, (2) the islands once (or currently) colonized, (3) the geographical region of Oceania, or (4) any island located in the Pacific Ocean.

This list of islands in the Pacific Ocean is organized by archipelago or political boundary. In order to keep this list of moderate size, the more complete lists for countries with large numbers of small or uninhabited islands have been hyperlinked.

==Name ambiguity and groupings==
The umbrella term &quot;Pacific Islands&quot; has taken on several meanings. Sometimes it is used to refer only to the islands defined as lying within Oceania. At other times, it is used to refer to the islands of the Pacific Ocean that were previously colonized by the British, French, Spaniards, Portuguese, Dutch, or Japanese, or by the United States. Examples include Borneo, the Pitcairn Islands and Taiwan (also known as Formosa).

A commonly applied biogeographic definition includes islands with oceanic geology that lie within Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia and the eastern Pacific (also known as the southeastern Pacific). These are usually considered to be the &quot;Tropical Pacific Islands&quot;. In the 1990s, ecologists Dieter Mueller-Dombois and Frederic Raymond Fosberg broke the Tropical Pacific Islands up into the following subdivisions:
* Western Melanesia
** The Bismarck Archipelago and other islands directly east of New Guinea
** Bougainville and Buka Island
** The Solomon Islands
* Eastern Melanesia
** The Santa Cruz Islands
** Vanuatu
** New Caledonia
** Fiji
* Subtropical islands in the Australia/New Zealand region
** Lord Howe Island
** Norfolk Island
* Micronesia
** The Bonin Islands and Volcano Islands
** Marcus Island
** The Northern Marianas
** The Southern Marianas
** The Caroline Islands
** Nauru and Banaba
** Wake Island
** Palau
** The Marshall Islands
** The Gilbert Islands (Kiribati)
* Central Polynesia
** Johnston Atoll
** The Phoenix Islands
** The Line Islands
** Howland Island, Baker Island, Jarvis Island, Malden Island and Starbuck Island
** Tuvalu, Tokelau and the Northern Cook Islands (Pukapuka, Nassau, Rakahanga, Manihiki, Penrhyn, Suwarrow and Palmerston)
* Western Polynesia
** Tonga
** Samoa
** Wallis and Futuna
** Niue
* Eastern Polynesia
** The rest of the Cook Islands
** The Austral Islands
** The Society Islands
** The Tuamotu Archipelago and the Pitcairn Islands
** Easter Island and Salas y Gómez
** The Marquesas Islands
* Northern Polynesia
** The Hawaiian Islands
* Oceanic islands of the Eastern Pacific
** The Revillagigedo Islands
** Cocos Island and Malpelo Island
** Clipperton Island
** The Galápagos Islands
** The Desventuradas Islands
** The Juan Fernández Islands

==Geopolitics and Oceania grouping==


The 2007 book &quot;Asia in the Pacific Islands: Replacing the West&quot;, by New Zealand Pacific scholar Ron Crocombe, considers the phrase &quot;Pacific Islands&quot; to politically encompass American Samoa, Australia, the Bonin Islands, the Cook Islands, Easter Island, East Timor, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, the Galápagos Islands, Guam, Hawaii, the Kermadec Islands, Kiribati, Lord Howe Island, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Norfolk Island, Niue, the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, the Torres Strait Islands, Wallis and Futuna, Western New Guinea and the United States Minor Outlying Islands (Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Midway Atoll, Palmyra Atoll and Wake Island). Crocombe noted that Easter Island, Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, the Galápagos Islands, the Kermadec Islands, the Pitcairn Islands and the Torres Strait Islands currently have no geopolitical connections to Asia, but that they could be of future strategic importance in the Asia-Pacific. Another definition given in the book for the term &quot;Pacific Islands&quot; is islands served by the Pacific Community, formerly known as the South Pacific Commission. It is a developmental organization whose members include Australia and the aforementioned islands which are not politically part of other countries. In his 1962 book &quot;War in the Pacific: Strategy and Command&quot;, American author Louis Morton places the insular landmasses of the Pacific under the label of the &quot;Pacific World&quot;. He considers it to encompass areas that were involved in the Pacific Theater of World War II. These areas include the islands of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, as well as Australia, the Aleutian Islands, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan.
Since the beginning of the 19th century, Australia and the islands of the Pacific have been grouped by geographers into a region called Oceania. It is often used as a quasi-continent, with the Pacific Ocean being the defining characteristic. In some countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, China, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Greece, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, Spain, Switzerland or Venezuela, Oceania is seen as a proper continent in the sense that it is &quot;one of the parts of the world&quot;. In his 1879 book &quot;Australasia&quot;, British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace commented that, &quot;Oceania is the word often used by continental geographers to describe the great world of islands we are now entering upon&quot; and that &quot;Australia forms its central and most important feature.&quot; 19th century definitions encompassed the region as beginning in the Malay Archipelago, and as ending near the Americas. In the 19th century, many geographers divided up Oceania into mostly racially-based subdivisions; &quot;Australasia&quot;, &quot;Malaysia&quot; (encompassing the Malay Archipelago), &quot;Melanesia&quot;, &quot;Micronesia&quot; and &quot;Polynesia&quot;. The 1995 book &quot;The Pacific Island States&quot;, by Australian author Stephen Henningham, claims that Oceania in its broadest sense &quot;incorporates all the insular areas between the Americas and Asia.&quot; In its broadest possible usage, it could include Australia, the Melanesian, Micronesian and Polynesian islands, the Japanese and Malay Archipelagos, Taiwan, the Ryukyu and Kuril Islands, the Aleutian Islands and isolated islands off Latin America such as the Juan Fernández Islands. Islands with geological and historical ties to the Asian mainland (such as those in the Malay Archipelago) are rarely included in present definitions of Oceania, nor are non-tropical islands to the north of Hawaii. The 2004 book &quot;The Making of Anthropology: The Semiotics of Self and Other in the Western Tradition&quot;, by Jacob Pandian and Susan Parman, states that &quot;some exclude from Oceania the nontropical islands such as Ryukyu, the Aleutian islands and Japan, and the islands such as Formosa, Indonesia and the Philippines that are closely linked with mainland Asia. Others include Indonesia and the Philippines with the heartland of Oceania.&quot;

Certain anthropological definitions restrict Oceania even further to only include islands which are culturally within Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. Conversely, Encyclopedia Britannica believe that the term &quot;Pacific Islands&quot; is much more synonymous with Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, and that Oceania, in its broadest sense, embraces all the areas of the Pacific which do not fall within Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. The World Factbook and the United Nations categorize Oceania/the Pacific area as one of the seven major continental divisions of the world, and the two organizations consider it to politically encompass American Samoa, Australia, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Fiji, Guam, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Norfolk Island, the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna and the United States Minor Outlying Islands.

Since the 1950s, many (particularly in English-speaking countries) have viewed Australia as a continent-sized landmass, although they are still sometimes viewed as a Pacific Island, or as both a continent and a Pacific Island. Australia is a founding member of the Pacific Islands Forum, which is now recognized as the main governing body for the Oceania region. It functions as a trade bloc and deals with defense issues, unlike with the Pacific Community, which includes most of the same members. By 2021, the Pacific Islands Forum included all sovereign Pacific Island nations, such as Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji and Tonga, in addition to dependencies of other nations, such as American Samoa, French Polynesia and Guam. Islands which have been fully integrated into other nations, including Easter Island (Chile) and Hawaii (United States), have also shown interest in joining. Tony deBrum, Foreign Minister for the Marshall Islands, stated in 2014, &quot;Not only is Australia our big brother down south, Australia is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum and Australia is a Pacific island, a big island, but a Pacific island.&quot; Japan and certain nations of the Malay Archipelago (including East Timor, Indonesia and the Philippines) have representation in the Pacific Islands Forum, but none are full members. The nations of the Malay Archipelago have their own regional governing organization called ASEAN, which includes mainland Southeast Asian nations such as Vietnam and Thailand. In July 2019, at the inaugural Indonesian Exposition held in Auckland, Indonesia launched its &#x27;Pacific Elevation&#x27; program, which would encompass a new era of elevated engagement with the region, with the country also using the event to lay claim that Indonesia is culturally and ethnically linked to the Pacific islands. The event was attended by dignitaries from Australia, New Zealand and some Pacific island countries.

<text>Aylmer is a town in Elgin County in southern Ontario, Canada, just north of Lake Erie, on Catfish Creek. It is south of Highway 401, and is almost equidistant between the United States cities of Detroit and Buffalo.

Aylmer is surrounded by Malahide Township.

==History==
In October 1817, John Van Patter, an immigrant from New York State, obtained 200 acres (80 hectares) of land and became the first settler on the site of Aylmer. During the 1830s a general store was opened and village lots sold. Originally called Troy, in 1835 it was renamed Aylmer after Lord Aylmer, then Governor-in-Chief of British North America. By 1851 local enterprises included sawmills and flour-mills powered by water from Catfish Creek. Aided by easy access to Lake Erie, Aylmer became by the mid-1860s the marketing centre for a rich agricultural and timber producing area. Benefiting greatly from the construction of the 230 km (150 mile) Canada Air Line Railway from Glencoe to Fort Erie, Aylmer became an incorporated village in 1872 and a town in 1887.

A Royal Canadian Air Force Training Facility, RCAF Station Aylmer was located just north of Aylmer in Malahide Township from 1941 to 1961. This station is now home to the Ontario Police College and The Aylmer Wildlife Management Area.

Former mayor Robert Habkirk (1994–2003) was again elected the mayor of Aylmer on November 13, 2006, to a four-year term. He was defeated by the former principal of East Elgin Secondary School, Jack Couckuyt, by a wide margin on October 25, 2010.

In 2004, a new arena, the East Elgin Community Complex, was completed to house the many hockey leagues in town. The Old Town Hall which houses the library, also has a restored theatre which houses occasional plays. For history buffs, the Aylmer Museum houses a collection of 19th century Victorian art pieces created from hair.

In 2007, Communities in Bloom, a nationwide beautification program, awarded Aylmer first place in Canada in the 5001 to 10,000 population category.

The community drew attention during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic when a local church held drive-in worship services where parishioners remained in their vehicles. The services were considered by Aylmer Police to be in possible violation of provincial restrictions on public gatherings but they opted not to levy fines of up to 100,000 CAD. In November that year, Aylmer was the site of a 2000-person demonstration against COVID-19 related restrictions.

==Mennonite and Amish communities==
In the mid-1970s, many Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites began migrating to the Aylmer area from Mexico. The Mennonites were Canadian citizens who had moved to Mexico from Manitoba and Saskatchewan during the first half of the 20th century. By the early 21st century, there was a large Mennonite population in Aylmer and the surrounding area. In addition to the Mennonite population there are sizable Dutch, German, and British descended populations in the area.

Just east of Aylmer is a sizable Old Order Amish community. This community was founded by families moving from Ohio in 1953. They were uncomfortable with a nuclear facility being constructed close to their community in Ohio. Since that time, the community has grown to encompass three &quot;districts&quot; in the surrounding area. A number of members from this community participate in the weekly Aylmer Sales Barn and sell fruit, vegetables, eggs, and animals, such as rabbits and chickens. This particular Amish community eschews the use of automobiles, electricity, and most modern conveniences. An Amish publishing house, Pathway Publishers, is based in the community.

==Tobacco industry==
The tobacco-growing industry played a large part in the economic development of Aylmer. Imperial Tobacco Canada built a plant in Aylmer in the mid-1940s. At its peak, Imperial employed more than 800 full-time and seasonal workers. After declining tobacco sales in Canada, Imperial began downsizing in the 1990s. In October 2005, Imperial Tobacco announced that the Aylmer and Guelph, Ontario, plants would close. The plant closed permanently in July 2007, putting the remaining 75 employees out of work.

==Ontario Police College==
In the early 1950s, the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police (OACP) proposed the idea of a central provincial police academy. In 1959 the Attorney General appointed an advisory committee on police training in 1962 announced the formal establishment of the college. OPC offered its first classes beginning January 7, 1963, in the temporary wartime training quarters of an abandoned Royal Canadian Air Force base near Aylmer, Ontario. In 1976 the college moved to its present facilities. The College Is situated on 300 acres (121.5 hectares) of rural land five kilometers (3 miles) northeast of the town of Aylmer, Ontario (190 km; 120 miles west of Toronto). The college has 165 full and part-time employees including instructors, support and seconded staff. The 45 permanent instructors are supplemented by police officers from various police services, usually for two-year periods. With very rare exceptions, all Police Officers in Ontario, Canada attend the college for their 13-week program in order to receive their Basic Constables Training Diploma. Once they have received the Diploma and after they have been sworn in as Peace Officers, they can then work in the Province of Ontario as police officers.

==Aylmer Fair==
The Aylmer Fair is a non-profit society run by the OAAS (Ontario Association of Agricultural Societies). They are the oldest agricultural fair in District 13. It is run by a board of Directors, and volunteers in the area. In 1846, the Aylmer and East Elgin Agricultural Society (formally known as the Malahide Agricultural Society up until 1860) began its annual exhibitions of agriculture and livestock to the people in and around the Aylmer area. In 30 years the fair grew from a few dozen exhibits in the 1850s to over 1700 in 1876. The Aylmer fair also expanded from an afternoon show to a two-day event and membership to the Society has grown to over 200 members. It was not until 1865 that ladies&#x27; exhibitions were included in the fair. Stock and wheat became uninteresting and was not likely to attract exhibitors and visitors. &quot;Women&#x27;s Work&quot; was an essential, interesting and an attracting element in the success of the fair. In 1874, 523 entries (1/6th of the exhibits) were based largely on Women&#x27;s Work. Throughout the early years the fair travelled and was held in many locations, but found its permanent location in 1875 in Aylmer, where 8 acres of land was purchased. In this year the fair held its first opening day, surrounded by a high well built board fence, charging $.10 for admission into the fair. The Aylmer Fair entered the 20th Century with unparalleled success. Businessmen supported it eagerly through donations and participation and even helped decorate the town for the fair days. It was known as &quot;Aylmer&#x27;s Greatest Fair,&quot; with a train excursion that travelled from Hamilton, London and St. Thomas with passengers wanting to see the fair. However, after issues of agricultural exhibits versus expensive attractions by business men, in 1910 the fair was cancelled. Farmers and others complained that throughout the preceding years, the extravagant attractions that were created leveled the significance that agriculture and livestock was given. It was a struggle to get the fair up and running again with many problems each year including funding issues and low admission rates until 1924. A turnover in personnel and the government granted more funding, this turning point created major changes in attractions and promotions over the next six years. During the 1940s, the war effort was a major theme of the fair. In 1941, admission costs, membership fees and 50% of the profits were given to the Red Cross and a war bond was purchased with the remaining 50%. The fair held its Centennial in 1956, celebrating its 100-year anniversary and the achievements it had developed. From 1945 to 1965 was the greatest period in the fair&#x27;s history. No period prior had sustained such growth in all aspects of the fair: in buildings, attendance, and growth of exhibits and in general participation. It has continued to grow. 1977 created a new record in attendance of 47,000 people present at the two-day event. It continues to grow every year, with great attractions including agriculture, family activities and midway events. 2013 marks the 168th year at the Aylmer Fair.

<doc id="341115" wikidata="Q606619" url="?curid=341115" title="Fish ladder">
<text>A fish ladder, also known as a fishway, fish pass, fish steps, or fish cannon, is a structure on or around artificial and natural barriers (such as dams, locks and waterfalls) to facilitate diadromous fishes&#x27; natural migration as well as movements of potamodromous species. Most fishways enable fish to pass around the barriers by swimming and leaping up a series of relatively low steps (hence the term &quot;ladder&quot;) into the waters on the other side. The velocity of water falling over the steps has to be great enough to attract the fish to the ladder, but it cannot be so great that it washes fish back downstream or exhausts them to the point of inability to continue their journey upriver.

==History==
Written reports of rough fishways date to 17th-century France, where bundles of branches were used to make steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions. 

A 1714 construction of an old channel bypassing a dam, &quot;originally cut for the passage of fish up and down the river&quot;, is mentioned in the 1823 U.S. Circuit Court Case Tyler v. Wilkinson. This example predates the 1880 fish ladder at Pawtuxet Falls. The 1714 channel &quot;wholly failed for this purpose&quot; and, in 1730, a mill was built in its place. The channel and its mill usage became an important legal case in U.S. water law.

A pool and weir salmon ladder was built around 1830 by James Smith, a Scottish engineer on the River Teith, near Deanston, Perthshire in Scotland. Both the weir and salmon ladder are there today and many subsequent salmon ladders built in Scotland were inspired by it. 

A version was patented in 1837 by Richard McFarlan of Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, who designed a fishway to bypass a dam at his water-powered lumber mill. In 1852–1854, the Ballisodare Fish Pass was built in County Sligo in Ireland to draw salmon into a river that had not supported a fishery. In 1880, the first fish ladder was built in Rhode Island, United States, on the Pawtuxet Falls Dam. The ladder was removed in 1924, when the City of Providence replaced the wood dam with a concrete one. USA legislated fishways in 1888.

As the Industrial Age advanced, dams and other river obstructions became larger and more common, leading to the need for effective fish by-passes.

==Types==
;Pool and weir: One of the oldest styles of fish ladders. It uses a series of small dams and pools of regular length to make a long, sloping channel for fish to travel around the obstruction. The channel acts as a fixed lock to gradually step down the water level; to head upstream, fish must jump over from box to box in the ladder.
;Baffle fishway: Uses a series of symmetrical close-spaced baffles in a channel to redirect the flow of water, allowing fish to swim around the barrier. Baffle fishways need not have resting areas, although pools can be included to provide a resting area or to reduce the velocity of the flow. Such fishways can be built with switchbacks to minimize the space needed for their construction. Baffles come in variety of designs. The most common design is the Larinier pass, named after the French engineer who designed them. They are suitable for coarse fish as well as salmonids, and can be built large enough to be used by canoes. The original design for a Denil fishway was developed in 1909 by a Belgian scientist, G. Denil; it has since been adjusted and adapted in many ways. The &quot;Alaskan Steeppass&quot;, for example, is a modular prefabricated Denil-fishway variant originally designed for remote areas of Alaska. Baffles have been installed by Project Maitai in several waterways in Nelson, New Zealand, to improve fish passage as part of general environmental restoration.
;Fish elevator (or fish lift): Breaks with the ladder design by providing a sort of elevator to carry fish over a barrier. It is well suited to tall barriers. With a fish elevator, fish swim into a collection area at the base of the obstruction. When enough fish accumulate in the collection area, they are nudged into a hopper that carries them into a flume that empties into the river above the barrier. On the Connecticut River, for example, two fish elevators lift up to 500 fish at a time, 52 feet (15.85 m), to clear the Holyoke Dam. In 2013, the elevator carried over 400,000 fish.
;Rock-ramp fishway: Uses large rocks and timbers to make pools and small falls that mimic natural structures. Because of the length of the channel needed for the ladder, such structures are most appropriate for relatively short barriers. They have a significant advantage in that they can provide fish spawning habitat.
;Vertical-slot fish passage: Similar to a pool-and-weir system, except that each &quot;dam&quot; has a narrow slot in it near the channel wall. This allows fish to swim upstream without leaping over an obstacle. Vertical-slot fish passages also tend to handle reasonably well the seasonal fluctuation in water levels on each side of the barrier. Recent studies suggest that navigation locks have a potential to be operated as vertical slot fishways to provide increased access for a range of biota, including poor swimmers.
;Fish siphon: Allows the pass to be installed parallel to a water course and can be used to link two watercourses. The pass utilises a syphon effect to regulate its flow. This style is particularly favoured to aid flood defence.
;Fish cannon: A wet, flexible pneumatic tube uses air pressure to suck in salmon one at a time and gently shoot them out into the destination water. The system was originally designed by Bellevue, Washington company Whooshh to safely move apples.
;Fish lock: A fish lock is a structure designed to facilitate the passage of fish over barriers such as dams or weirs, enabling them to access upstream habitats essential for spawning and growth. It operates similarly to a navigation lock, using a chamber that fills and empties to move fish across the barrier by adjusting water levels to match the upstream and downstream sections. There are several types of fish locks, such as the Borland fish lock, Deelder lock, Pavlov lock, and most recently, the Fishcon lock.
;Fishcon lock: The Fishcon lock enables both upstream and downstream fish migration in a compact space and was developed by the company Fishcon. Between 2019 and mid-2024, seven Fishcon locks were installed in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Five of these installations have been already independently evaluated with great results and deemed functional according to Austrian and German standards.
;Borland fish lock: This is similar to a canal lock. At the downstream end of the obstruction, fish are attracted to a collecting pool by an outflow of water through a sluice gate. At fixed intervals, the gate is closed, and water from the upper level fills the collecting pool and an inclined shaft, lifting the fish up to the upstream level. Once the shaft is full, a sluice at the top level opens, to allow fish to continue their journey upstream. The top sluice then closes, and the shaft empties for the process to begin again. A number of Borland fish locks have been built in Scotland, associated with hydro-electric dams, including one at Aigas Dam on the River Beauly.
;Deelder lock: Developed by Dutch engineer Klaas Deelder, this design features two chambers separated by an internal weir. Fish enter the lower chamber, which then fills with water, allowing them to swim over the weir into the upper chamber and continue upstream. This method has been effective in passing a wide range of fish species and sizes.
;Pavlov lock: This design, attributed to Russian engineer Dmitry Sergeyevich Pavlov, incorporates features to guide fish into the lock chamber, such as attraction flows and holding pools. The lock operates cyclically, filling and emptying to move fish upstream, and has been implemented in various regions to assist fish migration.


==Effectiveness==

Fish ladders have a mixed record of effectiveness. This varies for different types of species, with one study showing that only three percent of American Shad make it through all the fish ladders on the way to their spawning ground. Effectiveness depends on the fish species&#x27; swimming ability, and how the fish moves up and downstream. A fish passage that is designed to allow fish to pass upstream may not allow passage downstream, for instance. Fish passages do not always work.
In practice a challenge is matching swimming performance data to hydrodynamic measurements. Swim tests rarely use the same protocol and the output is either a single-point measurement or a bulk velocity. In contrast, physical and numerical modelling of fluid flow (i.e. hydrodynamics) deliver a detailed flow map, with a fine spatial and temporal resolution. Regulatory agencies face a difficult task to match hydrodynamic measurements and swimming performance data.

==Culverts==

During the last three decades, the ecological impact of culverts on natural streams and rivers has been recognised. While the culvert discharge capacity derives from hydrological and hydraulic engineering considerations, this results often in large velocities in the barrel, which may prevent fish from passing through.

Baffles may be installed along the barrel invert to provide some fish-friendly alternative. For low discharges, the baffles decrease the flow velocity and increase the water depth to facilitate fish passage. At larger discharges, baffles induce lower local velocities and generate recirculation regions. However, baffles can reduce drastically the culvert discharge capacity for a given afflux, thus increasing substantially the total cost of the culvert structure to achieve the same design discharge and afflux. It is believed that fish-turbulence interplay may facilitate upstream migration, albeit an optimum design must be based upon a careful characterisation of both hydrodynamics and fish kinematics. Finally the practical engineering design implications cannot be ignored, while a solid understanding of turbulence typology is a basic requirement to any successful boundary treatment conducive of upstream fish passage.

<text>A pegasus crossing (United Kingdom; also equestrian crossing) is a type of signalised pedestrian crossing, with special consideration for horse riders. This type of crossing is named after the mythical winged horse, Pegasus. They are primarily used in the United Kingdom and Peru.

At a minimum, these crossings are in the form of a pelican crossing or puffin crossing but simply have two control panels, one at the normal height for pedestrians or dismounted riders, and one two metres above the ground for the use of mounted riders, and the &quot;green man&quot; (walk) and &quot;red man&quot; (stop) pictograms are replaced with horses. Additional features, to improve safety, include a wooden fence or other barrier and a wider crossing so that the horses are further away from vehicles than normal.

If the crossing is to be used by pedestrians and cyclists too, then a parallel, separate toucan crossing may be placed next to the pegasus crossing.

==Installation and removal==
There are examples in Hyde Park, Richmond Park and village area of Wimbledon in London; Rayleigh, Colchester and Great Notley in Essex and Worsley, Salford as well as near Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey and in Colton on the former A6120 (now B6902) in Leeds. The crossing in Colton has a separate gravel covered section, signposted for use by horses only, located at 53.795888,-1.436130. Another example is situated between Whitby and Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay, North Yorkshire on Stainsacre Lane.

After completion of upgrading the A66 between Greta Bridge–Scotch Corner in 2007, two pegasus crossings were installed on the section of the dual carriageway in 2009, immediately to the west of Scotch Corner. These crossings included raised buttons for horse riders, safety fences and lights to control the traffic which consisted of only two orange lights. These crossings never became operational and with the exception of the safety fences were later removed.

There are also examples in use in Lima, Peru.

<doc id="341119" wikidata="Q426369" url="?curid=341119" title="Man's Search for Meaning">
<text>Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning is a 1946 book by Viktor Frankl chronicling his experiences as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps during World War II, and describing his psychotherapeutic method, which involved identifying a purpose to each person&#x27;s life through one of three ways: the completion of tasks, caring for another person, or finding meaning by facing suffering with dignity.

Frankl observed that among the fellow inmates in the concentration camp, those who survived were able to connect with a purpose in life to feel positive about and who then immersed themselves in imagining that purpose in their own way, such as conversing with an (imagined) loved one. According to Frankl, the way a prisoner imagined the future affected his longevity.

The book intends to answer the question &quot;How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?&quot; Part One constitutes Frankl&#x27;s analysis of his experiences in the concentration camps, while Part Two introduces his ideas of meaning and his theory for the link between people&#x27;s health and their sense of meaning in life. He called this theory logotherapy, and there are now multiple logotherapy institutes around the world.

According to a survey conducted by the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Library of Congress, &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot; belongs to a list of &quot;the ten most influential books in the United States.&quot; At the time of the author&#x27;s death in 1997, the book had sold over 10 million copies and had been translated into 24 languages.

==Editions==
The book&#x27;s original title is
&quot;Ein Psycholog erlebt das Konzentrationslager&quot; (&quot;A Psychologist Experiences the Concentration Camp&quot;).
Later German editions prefixed the title with &quot;Trotzdem Ja zum Leben Sagen&quot; (&quot;Nevertheless Say Yes to Life&quot;), taken from a line in &quot;Das Buchenwaldlied,&quot; a song written by Friedrich Löhner-Beda while an inmate at Buchenwald.
The title of the first English-language translation was &quot;From Death-Camp to Existentialism&quot;. The book&#x27;s common full English title is &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning: An Introduction to Logotherapy&quot;, although this subtitle is often not printed on the cover of modern editions.

==Experiences in a concentration camp==

Frankl identifies three psychological reactions experienced by all inmates to one degree or another:
# Shock during the initial admission phase to the camp,
# Apathy after becoming accustomed to camp existence, in which the inmate values only that which helps himself and his friends survive, and
# Reactions of depersonalization, moral deformity, bitterness, and disillusionment if he survives and is liberated.

Frankl concludes that the meaning of life is found in every moment of living; life never ceases to have meaning, even in suffering and death. In a group therapy session during a mass fast inflicted on the camp&#x27;s inmates trying to protect an anonymous fellow inmate from fatal retribution by authorities, Frankl offered the thought that for everyone in a dire condition there is someone looking down, a friend, family member, or even God, who would expect not to be disappointed. Frankl concludes from his experience that a prisoner&#x27;s psychological reactions are not solely the result of the conditions of his life, but also from the freedom of choice he always has even in severe suffering. The inner hold a prisoner has on his spiritual self relies on having a hope in the future, and that once a prisoner loses that hope, he is doomed.

Frankl also concludes that there are only two races of men, decent men and indecent. No society is free of either of them, and thus there were &quot;decent&quot; Nazi guards and &quot;indecent&quot; prisoners, most notably the kapo who would torture and abuse their fellow prisoners for personal gain.

His concluding passage in Part One describes the psychological reaction of the inmates to their liberation, which he separates into three stages. The first is depersonalization—a period of readjustment in which a prisoner gradually returns to the world. Initially, the liberated prisoners are so numb that they are unable to understand what freedom means or to emotionally respond to it. Part of them believes that it is an illusion or a dream that will be taken away from them. In their first foray outside their former prison, the prisoners realized that they could not comprehend pleasure. Flowers and the reality of the freedom they had dreamed about for years were all surreal, unable to be grasped in their depersonalization.

The body is the first element to break out of this stage, responding by big appetites of eating and wanting more sleeping. Only after the partial replenishing of the body is the mind finally able to respond, as &quot;feeling suddenly broke through the strange fetters which had restrained it&quot; (p. 111).

This begins the second stage, in which there is a danger of deformation. As the intense pressure on the mind is released, mental health can be endangered. Frankl uses the analogy of a diver suddenly released from his pressure chamber. He recounts the story of a friend who became immediately obsessed with dispensing the same violence in judgment of his abusers that they had inflicted on him.

Upon returning home, the prisoners had to struggle with two fundamental experiences that could damage their mental health: bitterness and disillusionment. The last stage is bitterness at the lack of responsiveness of the world outside—a &quot;superficiality and lack of feeling... so disgusting that one finally felt like creeping into a hole and neither hearing nor seeing human beings any more&quot; (p. 113). Worse was disillusionment, the discovery that suffering does not end, that the longed-for happiness will not come. This was the experience of those who—like Frankl—returned home to discover that no one awaited them. The hope that had sustained them throughout their time in the concentration camp was now gone. Frankl cites this experience as the most difficult to overcome.

As time passed, however, the prisoner&#x27;s experience in a concentration camp became nothing but a remembered nightmare. What is more, he comes to believe that he has nothing left to fear &quot;except his God&quot; (p. 115).

== Logotherapy: Man&#x27;s Will To Meaning ==
The central idea behind Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning, as described throughout Part I of the book is the idea of &quot;Man&#x27;s Will to Meaning&quot; being the central and overarching goal of each person&#x27;s life. This then extends to an academic discussion in Part II, titled &quot;Logotherapy&quot; 

Logotherapy is a therapeutic approach focused on finding purpose and meaning in life. He outlines three central sources of meaning: 

# Creating and achieving: Finding purpose through creative work, goals, and accomplishments.
# Experience and encounter: Gaining meaning through relationships, love, and appreciating beauty.
# Attitude towards unavoidable suffering: Developing resilience by choosing one’s attitude in the face of unavoidable pain and hardship, which can bring a profound sense of purpose.

==Reception==
In a 1991 survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club, &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot; was named one of the 10 most influential books in the US. At the time of Frankl&#x27;s death in 1997, the book had sold over 10 million copies and had been translated into 24 languages. As of 2022 the book has sold 16 million copies and been printed in 52 languages.

Gordon Allport, who wrote a preface to the book, described it as a &quot;gem of dramatic narrative&quot; which &quot;provides a compelling introduction to the most significant psychological movement of our day&quot;. Sarah Bakewell describes it as &quot;an incredibly powerful and moving example of what existentialist thought can actually be for in real life&quot; while Mary Fulbrook praises &quot;the way [Frankl] explores the importance of meaning in life as the key to survival.&quot;

However, aspects of the book have garnered criticism. One of Frankl&#x27;s main ideas in the book is that a positive attitude made one better equipped for surviving the camps. Richard Middleton-Kaplan has said that this implies, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that those who died had given up and that this paved the way for the idea of the Jews going like sheep to the slaughter. Holocaust analyst Lawrence L. Langer criticises Frankl&#x27;s promotion of logotherapy and says the book has a problematic subtext. He also accuses Frankl of having a tone of self-aggrandizement and a general inhumane sense of studying-detachment towards victims of the Holocaust.

In his book &quot;Faith in Freedom&quot;, psychiatrist Thomas Szasz states that Frankl&#x27;s survivor testimony was written to misdirect, and betrays instead an intent of a transparent effort to conceal Frankl&#x27;s actions and his collaboration with the Nazis, and that, in the assessment of Raul Hilberg, the founder of Holocaust Studies, Frankl&#x27;s historical account contains distortions akin to &#x27;s memoirs, which were translated into nine languages before being exposed as deeply problematic (and according to the most radical interpretation &#x27;false&#x27;) in Hilberg&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Politics of Memory&quot;. Szasz&#x27;s criticism of Frankl is not universally embraced. Similarly, Hilberg&#x27;s allegations have been rebutted by several reviewers. Comparison between Frankl&#x27;s memoirs and Wilkomirski&#x27;s memoirs leveled by Szasz, however, could legitimately be dismissed altogether as an inapt and misleading analogy insofar as questions arose (and remained) as to whether or not Wilkomirski had ever been an inmate at a concentration camp, whereas this was never a question in Frankl&#x27;s case: there is no doubt that he is a survivor.

Briefly: Conflicting views about the nature of memory under extreme conditions, as well as the sort of instinctual opportunism (for the sake of survival) or positive thinking mentality that often (one might even say &#x27;usually&#x27; or &#x27;almost always&#x27;) correlated with long-term survival in the Nazi death camps, makes the memoir an important document of witness during the holocaust but also highlight the way in which it displays the cognitive and psychological limits of representing a situation like the Nazi extermination from an &#x27;impartial&#x27; first person perspective.

Based on a suggestion in Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning, a proposed Statue of Responsibility has been designed by Utah sculptor Gary Lee Price and endorsed for construction by the Utah governor. In the book, Frankl makes the following statement about the sculpture:Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.

<text>Jordan Michael Houston III (born April 5, 1975), known professionally as Juicy J, is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Originally from Memphis, Tennessee, he is a founding member of the Southern hip-hop group Three 6 Mafia, established in 1991. He released ten studio albums with the group, which began as an underground act until attaining mainstream recognition and signing with Loud Records, an imprint of Columbia Records in 2000. The group&#x27;s 2005 single, &quot;Stay Fly&quot;, yielded their furthest commercial success, peaking at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. That same year, they recorded the song &quot;It&#x27;s Hard out Here for a Pimp&quot; for the film &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;, which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song.

His first two studio albums, &quot;Chronicles of the Juice Man&quot; (2002) and &quot;Hustle Till I Die&quot; (2009), were released in between Three 6 Mafia projects. He further pursued solo work during the group&#x27;s hiatus in 2011, and signed with Dr. Luke&#x27;s Kemosabe Records — an imprint of Columbia Records — and Wiz Khalifa&#x27;s Taylor Gang Entertainment (as both a recording artist and A&amp;R) the following year. His club-oriented 2012 single, &quot;Bandz a Make Her Dance&quot; (featuring Lil Wayne and 2 Chainz), peaked within the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and led his third album and major label debut, &quot;Stay Trippy&quot; (2013), which peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In the following two years, he guest appeared on the commercially successful singles &quot;23&quot; by Mike Will Made It, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind&quot; by Usher, &quot;She Knows&quot; by Ne-Yo, and the Grammy Award-nominated &quot;Dark Horse&quot; by Katy Perry, the latter of which peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. His fourth album, &quot;Rubba Band Business&quot; (2017), was met with commercial failure, and he returned to an independent career with his fifth album, &quot;The Hustle Continues&quot; (2020). 

Alongside recording, Juicy J been prolific in production work for other artists—having largely handled the production on Three 6 Mafia projects with DJ Paul—with credits on singles or albums for Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Ludacris, Sexyy Red, GloRilla, and Chief Keef, among others. He is the younger brother of frequent collaborator and fellow Memphis rapper Project Pat.

== Early life ==
Jordan Michael Houston III was born on April 5, 1975, in Memphis, Tennessee. As a teenager, he read a multitude of books and essays on the music industry, learning about marketing, publishing, and royalties. He looked up to fellow Tennessee artist, Al Bell, who was the brief co-owner of Stax Records.

=== 2010–2017: Taylor Gang, &quot;Stay Trippy&quot; and &quot;Rubba Band Business&quot; album ===

From 2009 through 2011, Juicy J moved away from Three 6 Mafia, focusing on his solo career. During this time, he frequently collaborated with Wiz Khalifa, appearing on his mixtapes and releasing some of his own, including &quot;Blue Dream &amp; Lean&quot;. In December 2011, Juicy J confirmed these rumors about him as the newest member of Wiz Khalifa&#x27;s Taylor Gang imprint, a part-owner and A&amp;R representative. In 2012, he was featured alongside his Taylor Gang label-mates, on the cover of &quot;Source Magazine&quot;″s May 2012 issue. In 2012, he released the lead single to his third album &quot;Stay Trippy&quot;, the chart topping &quot;Bandz a Make Her Dance&quot;, which features guest appearances from 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne. The song was created in a two-bedroom apartment in Washington, D.C., and was produced by Mike Will Made It. The song has peaked at number 29 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In September 2012, Juicy J secured a recording contract with Columbia Records and Dr. Luke&#x27;s Kemosabe Records. In November 2012, Juicy J announced his third studio album &quot;Stay Trippy&quot; would be released in 2013. He had shown some interest in working with Nas, Dr. Dre and Jay-Z on the album. He later announced that guest appearances on the album would include Wiz Khalifa, The Weeknd, Lil Wayne, 2 Chainz, Nicki Minaj, Chris Brown, Project Pat, Young Jeezy, Yelawolf and Big Sean. Juicy J revealed the album would feature production from frequent collaborators Lex Luger, Sonny Digital, Mike Will Made It, Dr. Luke, and Crazy Mike.

On January 20, 2013, it was announced Juicy J would perform at the 2013 Paid Dues festival on March 30, 2013. On January 25, 2013, he released &quot;Show Out&quot; featuring Big Sean and Young Jeezy, as the second single from &quot;Stay Trippy&quot;. In June 2013, the album&#x27;s third single &quot;Bounce It&quot;, was released. The album was released on August 23, 2013, when it debuted at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 64,000 copies in the United States. On September 10, 2013, Juicy J was featured in a song by Mike Will Made It which featured Miley Cyrus and Wiz Khalifa.

He released a new single &quot;No English&quot; featuring Travis Scott. On September 28, 2016, Juicy J released a new song &quot;Ballin&quot; with Kanye West on the hook.

=== 2018–present: New label and &quot;The Hustle Continues&quot; ===

The songs failed to gain traction commercially and Juicy J was granted release from his recording contract from Columbia Records. On July 31, 2020, Juicy J announced his fifth studio album would be called &quot;The Hustle Continues&quot; (previously used for a prior scrapped 2014 album title) and released &quot;Gah Damn High&quot; featuring Wiz Khalifa as the lead single through his new label Entertainment One.

<doc id="341122" wikidata="Q731669" url="?curid=341122" title="Caernarfonshire">
<text>Caernarfonshire (; , ), sometimes spelled Caernarvonshire or Carnarvonshire, was one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales, in the north-west of Wales.

==Geography==
The county was bounded to the north by the Irish Sea, to the east by Denbighshire, to the south by Cardigan Bay and Merionethshire, and to the west by Caernarfon Bay and the Menai Strait, which had separated it from Anglesey.

The county had a largely mountainous terrain. A large part of the Snowdonian Range lay in the centre and south-east of the former county, which included Snowdon itself, the highest mountain in Wales at 1,085 m (3,560 ft). The south-west of the county was formed by the Llŷn peninsula, with Bardsey Island lying off its western end. The north of the county, between the mountains and Menai Strait, had much more subdued relief. The east of the county was part of Vale of Conwy, with the River Conwy forming much of the eastern boundary. Llandudno and Creuddyn formed a small peninsula to the north-east across the Conwy estuary.

The counties included the city of Bangor and the towns and villages of Betws-y-Coed, Caernarfon, Conwy, Llandudno, Porthmadog and Pwllheli.

==History==
===Creation===
The county was originally created under the terms of the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 following Edward I of England&#x27;s conquest of the Principality of Wales and included the &quot;cantrefi&quot; of: Llŷn, Arfon, Arllechwedd and the &quot;commote&quot; of Eifionydd (the northern portion of Dunoding).

The county was divided into ten hundreds based on the existing Welsh commotes: Cymydmaen (anglicised as Commitmaen), Creuddyn, Dinllaen, Eifionydd (Evionydd), Cafflogion (Gaflogion), Llechwedd Isaf (...Isav), Llechwedd Uchaf (...Uchav), Nant Conwy (Nant-Conway), Is Gwyrfai (Isgorvai) and Uwch Gwyrfai (Uchgorvai).

===19th and 20th centuries===
During the 19th century the population increased steadily, from 46,000 in the 1801 census, to 81,093 in 1841, and up to 137,000 in the 1901 census (figures given for the registration county).

===Governance===

Under the Local Government Act 1888, an elected Carnarvonshire County Council took over functions from the county&#x27;s quarter sessions. The administrative county covered by the county council had identical borders to the geographic county.

The county and the town after which it was named were officially spelled &quot;Carnarvon&quot; until 1926. At a meeting on 10 November 1925 the borough council resolved to ask the county council to change the spelling to &quot;Caernarvon&quot;. The county council gave permission for the change of spelling for the name of the borough with effect from 14 January 1926, and at the same time decided to ask the government to also change the spelling of the county&#x27;s name to Caernarvon. The government confirmed the change in the spelling of the county&#x27;s name with effect from 1 July 1926.

The county council was based at County Hall, Caernarfon.

The county contained five ancient boroughs. Two of these (Caernarfon and Pwllheli) were reformed in 1835 by the Municipal Corporations Act. Criccieth established a special body of commissioners in 1873. Conwy (then called Conway in English) was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1877. The remaining borough, the City of Bangor was not reformed until 1883.

Under the Public Health Act 1848 and the Local Government Act 1858 a number of towns were created local board districts or local government districts respectively, with local boards to govern their areas. Other towns became improvement commissioners&#x27; districts by private act of parliament. In 1872 these, along with the municipal boroughs, became urban sanitary districts. At the same time the remainder of the county was divided into rural sanitary districts, some of which crossed county boundaries. The Local Government Act 1894 redesignated these as urban and rural districts. A county review order in 1934 made changes to the county&#x27;s districts.

The civil parish of Llysfaen was a detached exclave of the county. On 1 April 1923 Llysfaen was transferred to the county of Denbighshire.

Under the Local Government Act 1972 the administrative county of Caernarvonshire was abolished on 1 April 1974. It was largely split between the three districts of Aberconwy, Arfon and Dwyfor of Gwynedd (along with Merionethshire and Anglesey). Until 1974, Caernarvonshire was divided into civil parishes for the purpose of local government; these in large part equated to ecclesiastical parishes (see the table below), most of which still exist as part of the Church in Wales.

=== Parishes ===
Chapelries are listed in italics.

Most of these parishes ended up in Gwynedd, but those marked C ended up in Conwy.

The name Caernarfonshire (this time spelled with an f not a v, following the change of spelling of the town&#x27;s name from Caernarvon to Caernarfon in 1975) was very briefly revived as part of the name of an administrative area in 1996, when the county of Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire was created. It was, however, renamed Gwynedd almost immediately. Since then Caernarfonshire has been divided between the unitary authorities of Gwynedd to the west and Conwy to the east.

===Coat of arms===
Caernarvonshire County Council received a grant of armorial bearings from the College of Arms in 1949. The shield was a combination of the arms of two great native Princes of Wales. The gold and red quarters bearing lions were the arms of Llewelyn the Last – now used as the arms of the Principality of Wales. Across this was placed a green fess or horizontal band, on which were three gold eagles, from the arms of Owain Gwynedd. According to the poet Michael Drayton, the eagles formed the device on the banner of the Caernarvonshire soldiers at the Battle of Agincourt. The crest above the shield was a generic castle, representing Caernarfon, Conwy and Criccieth Castles. Behind the castle was the badge of the heir apparent: three ostrich feathers. The supporters were Welsh dragons with fish tails to show that Caernarvonshire was a Welsh maritime county. The supporter stood on a compartment of rocks for the rugged coast and mountains of the county. The motto &quot;Cadernid Gwynedd&quot; was adopted by the county council. This was derived from the Mabinogion, and can be translated as &quot;The Strength of Gwynedd&quot;.

== Legacy ==

===Flag===
The Flag of Caernarfonshire was registered with the Flag Institute in March 2012. The pattern of three gold eagles on a green background is a design with a long association with the county, having reputedly been flown by Caernarfonshire soldiers at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.

<text>Merionethshire, or Merioneth ( or &quot;&quot;), was one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales, in the north-west of Wales.

==Name==
&#x27;Merioneth&#x27; is an anglicisation of the Welsh placename &quot;Meirionnydd&quot; (for the geographical area) or &quot;Sir Feirionnydd&quot; (for the county), with a &#x27;double&#x27; , but the variant with a single is sometimes found in older works 

The name is derived from that of the earlier &quot;cantref&quot; of Meirionnydd. This supposedly took its name from Meirion, a grandson of Cunedda Wledig, who was granted the lordship of the area.

==Geography==
Merionethshire was a maritime county, bounded to the north by Caernarfonshire, to the east by Denbighshire, to the south by Montgomeryshire and Cardiganshire, and to the west by Cardigan Bay. With a total area of 1,731 km2 (668 sq miles), it was one of the more sparsely populated counties in Great Britain.

The Merioneth area remains one of the strongest Welsh-speaking parts of Wales, although places like Barmouth and Tywyn are very Anglicised. The coastline consisted alternately of cliffs and stretches of sand and the area generally was the most mountainous in Wales; a large part of the Snowdonia National Park had been within its boundaries. The highest point (county top) was Aran Fawddwy near the village of Dinas Mawddwy at 905 m (2,970 ft), which is also the southernmost mountain in Great Britain to exceed an altitude of 900 metres. However, the mountain of Cadair Idris 893 m (2,929 ft) to the south of Dolgellau was better known and hugely popular with hillwalkers. Other mountains include Arenig Fawr and the Rhinogydd. The chief rivers were the Dwyryd, the Mawddach, the Dyfi and the Dee, while in the south the Dulas formed the county boundary. Waterfalls such as Pistyll Cain and small lakes were numerous, the largest being Bala Lake ( long and broad).

==History==

The region which became Merionethshire previously constituted the Cantrefs of Meirionydd and Penllyn, and the Commote of Ardudwy. Prior to the 10th century, Ardudwy formed part of the principality of Dunoding, while Meirionydd and Penllyn were part of Powys.

Welsh records from the end of this period, and later, treat Dunoding as a vassal of Gwynedd, ruled by an ancient cadet branch of the same family. Nevertheless, according to John Edward Lloyd, Dunoding had been independent of Gwynedd, at the time of Cadfan ap Iago (in the early 7th century), and before.

The Norman presence in England, after 1066, was the most significant factor which disrupted this pattern.

In 1067, the rulers of Gwynedd and Powys invaded England, in support of Eadric the Wild, a leader of continued Saxon resistance against the Normans. When Northern England revolted against in 1080, the Normans responded by preemptively attacking, and then occupying Wales, to prevent any further Welsh assistance to the English. In 1094, the Welsh decided to revolt, but Hugh of Chester, the nearest Norman magnate, successfully re-captured North Wales by the end of 1098 (with Norwegian assistance).

Gruffudd ap Cynan, the heir to the principality of Gwynedd, came to an accommodation with the Normans, who restored him to power in Gwynedd, excepting the Perfeddwlad. Once Hugh died (in 1101), Gruffudd made further representations to King Henry I, who in response granted Dunodin to Gruffudd, as well. Gruffudd&#x27;s sons engaged in expansionist attacks on surrounding territory, taking Meirionydd from Powys in 1123, and annexing it to Gwynedd.

Following the death of Madog ap Maredudd, the powerful ruler of Powys, and the death of his immediate heir, Madog&#x27;s remaining sons divided Powys between them. Penllyn was the portion which went to Owain Brogyntyn. Owain was too weak, compared with his father, to resist Gwynedd&#x27;s aggressive behaviour, and was forced to become a vassal of Owain Gwynedd, the son of Gruffudd who now ruled Gwynedd; Penllyn, as a result, became a mere Cantref of Gwynedd.

Dunoding is naturally divided in the middle, by Tremadog Bay and the gorges and marshland of the Glaslyn river; Ardudwy is the portion south of that divide. In the early 13th century, Llywelyn Fawr, Owain Gwynedd&#x27;s grandson, established a distinct territorial unit comprising Ardudwy and Meirionydd (which is immediately south of Ardudwy), and gave it to his own son, Gruffydd, as an appanage. In 1221, however, Gruffydd was stripped of these lands for ruling them too oppressively.

In 1245, Gruffydd&#x27;s half-brother, Dafydd, launched an attack against his uncle - King Henry III - eventually resulting in the loss of the Perfeddwlad. When Gruffydd&#x27;s son, Llywelyn, allied with the enemies of Edward I (Henry&#x27;s son) and tried to recover the Perfeddwlad, Edward launched a huge invasion of Gwynedd, resulting in the death of Llywelyn in 1282.

Two years later, in 1284, King Edward issued the Statute of Rhuddlan, terminating Gwynedd&#x27;s existence as a state. The former appanage of Ardudwy-Merionydd, together with Penllyn, which had been part of Gwynedd for less than 150 years, were converted into Merionethshire (taking the name from Meirionydd).

Merioneth was an important part of the Welsh slate industry in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with major quarrying centres at Blaenau Ffestiniog in the north of the county and Corris in the south, with other large quarries at Abergynolwyn, Aberllefenni, Arthog, and the Cwm Ebol quarry at Pennal.

In 1947, ahead of his marriage to Princess Elizabeth, Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten was created Earl of Merioneth, as well as Duke of Edinburgh and Baron Greenwich, by his father-in-law, King George VI.

==Local government==
An administrative county of Merioneth was created under the Local Government Act 1888 on 1 April 1889. The first election to the new authority was held in January 1889. The county council was originally based at County Hall in Smithfield Street in Dolgellau before moving to modern facilities at Cae Penarlag in Dolgellau in 1953. The county was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974. The bulk formed the Meirionnydd district of Gwynedd, with a small area in the north east, Edeirnion Rural District, becoming part of the Glyndŵr district of Clwyd.

Until 1974, Merionethshire was divided into civil parishes for the purpose of local government; these in large part equated to ecclesiastical parishes (see the table below), most of which still exist as part of the Church in Wales.
Most of these parishes ended up in Gwynedd, but those marked D are in Denbighshire. Chapelries are listed in italics.

As a result of the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, which came into force on 1 April 1996, the Glyndŵr area was made a part of the new Denbighshire principal area, with the rest forming a new Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire principal area. The latter area was, however, renamed Gwynedd almost immediately.

<doc id="341130" wikidata="Q547052" url="?curid=341130" title="Brecknockshire">
<text>Brecknockshire ( or ), also known as the County of Brecknock, Breconshire, or the County of Brecon, was one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales. It was created in 1536 under the Laws in Wales Act 1535. From 1889 it was an administrative county with a county council; the administrative county was abolished in 1974. The county was named after the medieval Welsh territory of Brycheiniog, which was anglicised to &quot;Brecknock&quot; and also gave its name to the county town of Brecon. The county was mountainous and primarily rural.

==Geography==

Brecknockshire was bounded to the north by Radnorshire, to the east by Herefordshire and Monmouthshire, to the south by Monmouthshire and Glamorgan, and to the west by Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire.

The county was predominantly rural and mountainous. The Black Mountains occupy the southeast of the area, the Brecon Beacons the central region, Fforest Fawr the southwest and Mynydd Epynt the north. Its highest point was Pen y Fan, 2907 ft (886 m). The River Wye traces nearly the whole of the northern boundary, and the Usk flowed in an easterly direction through the central valley. The main towns were Brecon, Beaufort, Brynmawr, Builth Wells, Crickhowell, Hay-on-Wye, Llanelly, Llanwrtyd Wells, Rassau, Talgarth, Vaynor and Ystradgynlais.

==History==

The county of Brecknock was created in 1536 under the Laws in Wales Act 1535, which formally incorporated Wales into the Kingdom of England and extended English models of government, including counties, across all of Wales. Previously the Brecknockshire area had been subdivided into various smaller marcher lordships and other territories. The largest of these were the Lordship of Brecknock, which had its roots in the medieval Welsh kingdom of Brycheiniog, and the cantref of Buellt.

===Brycheiniog===
Brycheiniog was an independent kingdom in South Wales in the Early Middle Ages. It often acted as a buffer state between England to the east and the powerful south Welsh kingdom of Deheubarth to the west. This kingdom covered the area which later became the southern part of Brecknockshire. The county&#x27;s Welsh name (Sir Frycheiniog – the shire of Brycheiniog) is derived from the kingdom&#x27;s name.

The exact origins of Brycheiniog are unclear but the name is thought to derive from Brychan mac Anlach, the 5th century ruler of the area. The lands of his kingdom supposedly formed a dowry from his father-in-law Tewdrig ap Teithfallt. Over the succeeding centuries many dynasties ruled the kingdom, alliances were made and broken, victories won and defeats suffered, but the kingdom maintained its integrity and identity up to Norman times.

===Cantref of Buellt===
Buellt or Builth was a cantref in medieval Wales, located west of the River Wye. Unlike most cantrefs, it was not part of any of the major Welsh kingdoms for most of its history, but was instead ruled by an autonomous local dynasty. During the Norman invasion of Wales, the Marcher Lord Philip de Braose conquered Buellt around 1095. The area then changed hands between multiple Norman and Welsh figures. In November 1282, Edward I overran Buellt as part of his final conquest of Wales and the cantref became a crown possession.

===Lordship of Brecknock===
Bernard de Neufmarché was a minor Norman lord who rose to power in the Welsh Marches before successfully undertaking the invasion and conquest of the Kingdom of Brycheiniog between 1088 and 1095. Bernard established a Marcher Lordship in its place – the Lordship of Brecknock.

The lordship was ruled by numerous families over the next 400 years. By the early Tudor period, it was ruled by the Earls of Buckingham. When Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, was executed for treason, having been suspected of plotting against King Henry VIII, the Lordship was forfeited to the crown. Henry VIII combined it with the cantref of Buellt.

By his Laws in Wales Acts, Henry converted the combined territory - the Lordships of Brecknock and Buellt - into Brecknockshire, subject to standard English law.

===Creation of county===
The Laws in Wales Act 1535 created the County of Brecknock by combining a number of &quot;lordships, towns, parishes, commotes and cantreds&quot; in the &quot;Country or Dominion of Wales&quot;. The areas combined were:
&quot;Brekenoke&quot; (Brecknock), &quot;Crekehowell&quot; (Crickhowell) &quot;Tretowre&quot;, &quot;Penkelly&quot;, &quot;Englisshe Talgarth&quot;, &quot;Welsshe Talgarth&quot;, &quot;Dynas&quot;, &quot;The Haye&quot; (Hay-on-Wye), &quot;Glynebogh&quot;, &quot;Broynlles&quot; (Bronllys), &quot;Cantercely&quot; (Cantref Selyf), &quot;Llando Blaynllynby&quot;, &quot;Estrodewe&quot;, &quot;Buelthe&quot; (Builth), and &quot;Llangors&quot;. The town of Brecknock or Brecon was declared the county town.

The county was divided into six hundreds in 1542: Builth, Crickhowell, Devynnock, Merthyr, Penkelly, and Talgarth. Brecknock was the only borough in the county. Other market towns were Builth, Crickhowell and Hay-on-Wye. Under the terms of the 1535 legislation one member of parliament was returned for the borough and one for the county.

===Breconshire County Council===

Elected county councils were created in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, taking over administrative functions which had previously been performed by unelected magistrates at the quarter sessions. The 1888 Act also directed that urban sanitary districts which straddled county boundaries should be placed wholly in the county which had the majority of the population. Along Brecknockshire&#x27;s southern border with Monmouthshire, there were four such urban sanitary districts which straddled the county boundary: Brynmawr, Ebbw Vale, Rhymney, and Tredegar. Brynmawr was placed entirely in Brecknockshire, whilst Ebbw Vale, Rhymney and Tredegar were placed entirely in Monmouthshire. Brecknockshire therefore gained the southern parts of Brynmawr, but ceded to Monmouthshire the Llechryd area (in Rhymney district), the Dukestown area (in Tredegar district) and the Beaufort and Rassau areas (in Ebbw Vale district).
The county council held its meetings at Brecon Shire Hall, the county&#x27;s main courthouse, which had been built in 1842 and was also the meeting place of the quarter sessions. The county council&#x27;s main offices were at Watton Mount, a large house directly opposite the shire hall, until 1962 when New County Hall was built immediately behind the shire hall. Following the local government reorganisation in 1974, the New County Hall became an area office for Powys County Council and also served as offices for the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority for some years, but was demolished in 2016.

The 1535 Act which created the county had called it the &quot;County or Shire of Brecknock&quot;, and also used the spelling Brecknock for the town. The spelling of the town&#x27;s name was subsequently standardised to &#x27;Brecon&#x27; instead, and there was occasional debate about the correct name of the county. In 1884, the county&#x27;s magistrates at the quarter sessions decided that &#x27;Brecknock&#x27; was the correct form, having been used in the statute creating the county. Conversely, the county council created in 1889 decided by 21 votes to 16 to adopt the name &#x27;Breconshire County Council&#x27; rather than &#x27;Council of the County of Brecknock&#x27;. Efforts to get the two bodies to agree on a standard form of the name failed. The quarter sessions maintained that they had no authority to go against the form used in statute, whilst the county council went so far as to have erratum slips inserted in books of statistics advising readers that &quot;the words &#x27;Brecknock&#x27; and &#x27;Brecknockshire&#x27; be throughout read as if the words &#x27;Brecon&#x27; and &#x27;Breconshire&#x27; had been printed in lieu thereof.&quot;

Under the Public Health Act 1848 and the Local Government Act 1858 a number of towns were created Local Board Districts or Local Government Districts respectively, with local boards to govern their areas. In 1875 these, along with the Borough of Brecknock, became urban sanitary districts. At the same time the remainder of the county was divided into rural sanitary districts, some of which crossed county boundaries. The Local Government Act 1894 redesignated these as urban and rural districts. Two civil parishes were administered by rural district councils in neighbouring counties until 1934.

===Abolition===
The administrative county of Brecknock was abolished in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972. The bulk of its area passed to the new county of Powys, where it became the Brecknock District, one of three districts. Along Brecknockshire&#x27;s southern boundary there were four communities that did not become part of Powys under the 1974 reforms: Penderyn went to the Cynon Valley district of Mid Glamorgan, Vaynor went to Merthyr Tydfil district of Mid Glamorgan, and Brynmawr and Llanelly both went to Blaenau Gwent.

In 1996 a further reorganisation of local government took place in Wales, and Powys became a unitary authority. Powys County Council established a Brecknockshire &quot;shire committee&quot; consisting of councillors elected for electoral divisions within the former Borough of Brecknock. According to the 2001 census the area covered by the shire committee had a population of 42,075. The county council abolished its shire committees in 2018.

==Culture and community==
The Brecknockshire Agricultural Society, established in 1755, is the oldest continuous such society in Great Britain. The society organises the Brecon County Show, held annually on the 1st Saturday in August at The Showground, Watton, Brecon.

Brecknock Young Farmers has 13 clubs throughout the county. It is affiliated to the National Federation of Young Farmers Clubs.

Brecknock Society and Museum Friends (Welsh: Cymdeithas Brycheiniog a Chyfeillion yr Amgueddfa), found in 1928, is a historical society that promotes &quot;the study and understanding of the Archaeology, History, Geology, Natural History, the Arts and Literature of Wales, especially the historic county of Brecknock.&quot; The organization has published the historical journal Brycheiniog since 1955. It is closely associated with funding and running the Y Gaer.

The Brecon Jazz Festival has been held annually since 1984. Normally staged in early August, it has played host to a range of jazz musicians from across the world. A Brecon Fringe Festival organises alternative free music in pubs, hotels, galleries and cafes in the town.

Hay-on-Wye is a destination for bibliophiles in the United Kingdom, with two dozen bookshops, many selling specialist and second-hand books. Richard Booth opened his first shop there in 1962, and by the 1970s Hay had gained the nickname &quot;The Town of Books&quot;.

The Hay Festival of Literature and the Arts is a major event in the British cultural calendar. Devised by Norman, Rhoda and Peter Florence in 1988, the festival runs for ten days from May to June. It was described by Bill Clinton in 2001 as &quot;The Woodstock of the mind&quot;.

==Transport==
===Road===
The A40 London-West Wales trunk road passes in an east-west direction through the county, entering near Glangrwyney, passing through Crickhowell, by-passing Brecon, leaving the county after passing through Trecastle. The A483 Swansea-Manchester trunk road passes through the north-west, entering south of Llanwrtyd Wells and leaving north of Builth Wells. The A470 Cardiff-Glan Conway trunk road enters the county north of Merthyr Tydfil and, after by-passing Brecon, hugs the eastern border until it leaves the county when it crosses the River Wye at Builth Wells. The A465 (Heads of the Valleys Road) winds in and out of the county, following its southern borders with Monmouthshire and Glamorgan.

===Rail===
The Heart of Wales line runs from Cravens Arms in Shropshire to Llanelli in Carmarthenshire. It follows a similar route to the A483 through the north of the county, with stops at Sugar Loaf, Llanwrtyd Wells, Llangammarch Wells, Garth and Cilmeri. Builth Road Station to the north of Builth Wells is situated in Radnorshire. The south of the county once had an extensive rail network with connections through Glamorgan and Monmouthshire to Neath, Merthyr Tydfil, Cardiff, Newport and thence to the main Great Western main line. The Brecon Mountain Railway is a 1 ft 11 3⁄4 in (603 mm) narrow gauge tourist railway on the south side of the Brecon Beacons. It climbs northwards from Pant (in Glamorgan) along the full length of the Pontsticill Reservoir (also called &#x27;Taf Fechan&#x27; reservoir by Welsh Water) and continues past the adjoining Pentwyn reservoir to Torpantau.

===Cycling===
The National Cycle Route 8, which runs from Cardiff to Holyhead, passes through the county. From Cefn-coed-y-cymmer to Brecon this follows the Taff Trail.

===Canal===
The Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal ran from Brecon to Newport. It was completed at the start of the nineteenth century but closed in 1962. The route from Brecon to Abergavenny has since been re-opened. 35 miles are currently navigable, most of them running through the Brecon Beacons.

==Religious sites==
St Mary&#x27;s Church, Brecon is a Grade II* listed building. The structure was originally a chapel of ease for the priory. The 90 feet (27 m) West Tower dates to 1510 and is attributed to Edward, Duke of Buckingham. The eight bells date to 1750.

The Cathedral Church of St John the Evangelist is the cathedral of the Diocese of Swansea and Brecon in the Church in Wales. The cathedral is thought to be on the site of an earlier Celtic church, of which no trace remains. A new church, dedicated to St. John, was built on the orders of Bernard de Neufmarché.

St David&#x27;s Church, Llanfaes referred to locally as Llanfaes Church, was probably founded in the early sixteenth century. It is probable that the site and the name of the present Church were chosen because of the close proximity of a fresh water well called Ffynnon Dewi (David&#x27;s Well) which was situated approximately 150 metres south of the church.

Plough Lane Chapel, Brecon, also known as Plough United Reformed Church, is a Grade II* listed building. The present building dates back to 1841 and was re-modelled by Owen Morris Roberts and is considered to be one of the finest chapel interiors in Wales.

The Church of St Elli, Llanelly is dedicated to the 6th-century Saint Elli, who may have been a daughter or granddaughter of King Brychan. The church dates from the 14th century, or earlier, but little remains of this period. The nave is medieval but its walls were all rebuilt in the restorations of the 19th and 20th centuries.

St Mary&#x27;s Church, Hay-on-Wye consists of a nave and chancel with a square embattled tower at the west end. Separated by a deep dingle, which probably was formerly a moat, it is situated westward of the town upon an almost precipitous eminence, near to the River Wye.

St Edmund&#x27;s Church, Crickhowell is a Grade II* listed building built in the early 14th century. It has the only shingled spire in the county.

The Church of St Issui, Partrishow dates from 1060. The existing building was mainly constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries. The church is most famous for its rood screen which dates from 1500. It is a Grade I listed building.

St David&#x27;s Church, Llanddew is one of the oldest churches in Brecknockshire. The building dates from around the 13th century and has a cruciform shape, with a central tower.

== Civil parishes ==
From the medieval period until 1974, Brecknockshire was divided into civil parishes for the purpose of local government; these in large part equated to ecclesiastical parishes (see the table below), most of which still exist as part of the Church in Wales. Chapelries are listed in &quot;italics&quot;.

==Sport==
Brecon Rugby Football Club (Welsh: Clwb Rygbi Aberhonddu) was one of the eleven founding members of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1881. It is a feeder club for the Cardiff Blues. The club plays at Parc De Pugh, Brecon.

Gwernyfed Rugby Football Club is based in Talgarth. It is a feeder club for the Cardiff Blues. Gwernyfed RFC was founded in 1965 by two school teachers from Gwernyfed High School.

The county has four football clubs: Talgath Town FC, Brecon Corinthians AFC, Brecon Northcote FC and Builth Wells FC. All play in the Welsh football league system.

The county has four clubs affiliated to the Welsh Bowling Association: at Brecon, Talgarth, Builth Wells and Hay on-Wye.

Brecon Leisure Centre at Penlan has a swimming pool, gymnasium, ten-pin bowling and a climbing wall. It is the headquarters of Brecon Hockey Club and of Brecon Athletics Club. Crickhowell Community Sports Centre has indoor and outdoor sports facilities and is a conference venue. Builth Wells Sports Centre and Swimming Pool provides facilities in the north of the county. The Gwernyfed and Hay Leisure Centre at Three Cocks has a fitness suite, sports hall and multi-purpose floodlit pitch.

==Coat of arms==
On establishment in 1889 the Breconshire County Council adopted the attributed arms of Brychan, fifth century founder of Brycheiniog. The shield was quartered. In the first and fourth quarters were the purported arms of Brychan&#x27;s father Anlach: &quot;sable a fess cotised or between two swords in pale argent hilted gold, the upper sword point-upwards, the lower point-downwards&quot;. In the second and third quarters were arms representing Brychan&#x27;s mother, Marchell: &quot;or, three reremice (bats) 2 and 1 azure&quot;. The motto &quot;Undeb Hedd Llywddiant&quot; or &quot;Unity, Peace, Prosperity&quot; was used with the arms. The supposed fifth-century arms were invented in the Middle Ages, heraldry having not developed until several centuries later. The county council did not obtain an official grant of armorial bearings, although the unofficial arms subsequently became the basis for those granted to the successor Brecknock Borough Council.

<doc id="341133" wikidata="Q2062285" url="?curid=341133" title="Induction welding">
<text>Induction welding is a form of welding that uses electromagnetic induction to heat the workpiece. The welding apparatus contains an induction coil that is energised with a radio-frequency electric current. This generates a high-frequency electromagnetic field that acts on either an electrically conductive or a ferromagnetic workpiece. In an electrically conductive workpiece, the main heating effect is resistive heating, which is due to induced currents called eddy currents. In a ferromagnetic workpiece, the heating is caused mainly by hysteresis, as the electromagnetic field repeatedly distorts the magnetic domains of the ferromagnetic material. In practice, most materials undergo a combination of these two effects.

Nonmagnetic materials and electrical insulators such as plastics can be induction-welded by implanting them with metallic or ferromagnetic compounds, called susceptors, that absorb the electromagnetic energy from the induction coil, become hot, and lose their heat to the surrounding material by thermal conduction.
Plastic can also be induction welded by embedding the plastic with electrically conductive fibers like metals or carbon fiber. Induced eddy currents resistively heat the embedded fibers which lose their heat to the surrounding plastic by conduction. Induction welding of carbon fiber reinforced plastics is commonly used in the aerospace industry.

Induction welding is used for long production runs and is a highly automated process, usually used for welding the seams of pipes. It can be a very fast process, as a lot of power can be transferred to a localised area, so the faying surfaces melt very quickly and can be pressed together to form a continuous rolling weld.

The depth that the currents, and therefore heating, penetrates from the surface is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency. The temperature of the metals being welded and their composition will also affect the penetration depth. This process is very similar to resistance welding, except that in the case of resistance welding the current is delivered using contacts to the workpiece instead of using induction.

Induction welding was first discovered by Michael Faraday. The basics of induction welding explain that the magnetic field&#x27;s direction is dependent on the direction of current flow. and the field&#x27;s direction will change at the same rate as the current&#x27;s frequency. For example, a 120 Hz AC current will cause the field to change directions 120 times a second. This concept is known as Faraday&#x27;s Law.

When induction welding takes place, the work pieces heat up to under the melting temperature and the edges of the pieces are placed together impurities get forced out to give a solid forge weld.

Induction welding is used for joining a multitude of thermoplastics and thermosetting matrix composites. The apparatus used for induction welding processes includes a radio frequency power generator, a heating station, the work piece material, and a cooling system.

The power generator comes in either the form of solid state or vacuum tube and is used to provide an alternating current of 230-340 V or a frequency of 50–60 Hz to the system. This value is determined by what induction coil is used with the piece.

The heat station utilizes a capacitor and a coil to heat the work pieces. The capacitor matches the power generators output and the induction coil transfers energy to the piece. When welding the coil needs to be close to the work piece to maximize the energy transfer and the work piece used during induction welding is an important key component of optimal efficiency.

Some equations to consider for induction welding include:

Thermal calculation: formula_1

Where: formula_2 is thermal mass

formula_3 is resistivity

formula_4 is efficiency

formula_5 is surface density

Newton Cooling Equation: formula_6

Where: formula_7 is heat flux density

h is the heat transfer coefficient

formula_8 is the temperature of the work piece surface

formula_9 is the temperature of the surrounding air

<text>Hypnotize Minds Productions, known by the stage name Hypnotize Camp Posse or HCP, is an American record label founded by DJ Paul and Juicy J of Three 6 Mafia in 1997, in Memphis, Tennessee. The label served as the successor to Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s previous label, Prophet Entertainment, which was co-founded by DJ Paul and Juicy J along with Nicholas ‘Nick Scarfo’ Jackson in 1994. Hypnotize Minds was created after DJ Paul and Juicy J had a disagreement with Jackson, which led to Three 6 Mafia and several other artists previously on the Prophet label to move to the new Hypnotize Minds imprint.

As Hypnotize Camp Posse, the collective released one self-titled group album, &quot;Hypnotize Camp Posse&quot;, in 2000. The album follows the other Three 6 Mafia-sponsored posse album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Body Parts&quot; by Prophet Posse, which features many of the same artists. Apart from the album, the group, like its predecessor, Prophet Posse, is known for their posse songs, which are featured on nearly every album release by Hypnotize Minds up until 2006, including all Three 6 Mafia albums. The posse songs feature verses from all or most members of the posse and label at the times of recording.

Hypnotize Minds has been assumed defunct since 2012 in conjuncture with Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s hiatus, with the Lil Wyte album &quot;Still Doubted?&quot; (released on June 19, 2012) being the label&#x27;s most recent release.

<text> (literally, &quot;strong German&quot;, albeit with &quot;ck&quot; for &quot;k&quot;, as dictated by the conventions of the variant) is an imagined language created by Matthias Koeppel, a German painter and poet and self-proclaimed &quot;Sprachkünstler&quot; (artist of language). It exaggerates stereotypical (mostly phonetic and orthographic) traits of older stages of German and some modern (especially Upper German) dialects in an impressionistic way, rather than in a rigorously systematic fashion.

Matthias Koeppel started to write humorous poems in &quot;Starckdeutsch&quot; in 1972. A collection of them was published as in 1981.

<text>Patrick Earl Houston (born February 8, 1973), known professionally as Project Pat, is an American rapper from Tennessee. He is the older brother of Juicy J, the co-founder of Three 6 Mafia.

Houston was formerly a member of the hip-hop group the Kaze, joining in 1998, the same year that their debut album &quot;Kamakazie Timez Up&quot; was released.

==Career==
===Music beginnings and &quot;Ghetty Green&quot;===
Project Pat began his career with appearances on his brother Juicy J&#x27;s early releases with DJ Paul in the early 1990s. After serving several years in prison for robbery charges and disappearing from recording, he re-emerged in 1999 with the solo album &quot;Ghetty Green&quot;, released on his brother&#x27;s Hypnotize Minds label. He became an affiliated member of Juicy and Paul&#x27;s group Three 6 Mafia, and first gained mainstream attention when he provided the hook for the group&#x27;s hit single &quot;Sippin&#x27; on Some Syrup&quot; in 2000.

===2000–2002: &quot;Mista Don&#x27;t Play: Everythangs Workin&quot; and &quot;Layin&#x27; Da Smack Down&quot;===
Houston released his second studio album &quot;Mista Don&#x27;t Play: Everythangs Workin&quot; on February 13, 2001. The singles &quot;Chickenhead&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Save Her&quot; gained national radio airplay, along with music videos appearing on BET and MTV.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Mista Don&#x27;t Play&quot;, Houston was charged with a parole violation and began a four-year prison sentence after unlicensed guns were discovered in his car during a traffic stop. His third album &quot;Layin&#x27; Da Smack Down&quot; was released in 2002 shortly after the beginning of the sentence and featured a video made for &quot;Make Dat Azz Clap&quot;.

===2002–2006: Release and &quot;Crook by da Book: The Fed Story&quot;===
After his release from prison in 2005 he released &quot;Crook by da Book: The Fed Story&quot; which came in on #64 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling about 40,000 copies in its first week. The first single off the album was &quot;Good Googly Moogly&quot; featuring DJ Paul and Juicy J.

===2007–2011: &quot;Walkin&#x27; Bank Roll&quot;, &quot;Real Recognize Real&quot; &amp; &quot;Loud Pack&quot;===
After Houston was released from his deal with Columbia he signed with Koch, now known as E1. His fifth studio album &quot;Walkin&#x27; Bank Roll was&quot; released in 2007 and debuted at No. 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The lead single from the album was &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me No Mo&#x27;&quot; featuring Three 6 Mafia. His sixth studio album &quot;Real Recognize Real&quot; was his first major release for the label Asylum Records. The album featured the hit single &quot;Keep It Hood&quot; featuring OJ da Juiceman. It debuted at No. 8 on the Top Rap Albums Chart, with about 10,000 copies sold in the first week of release. On July 19, 2011, Houston released his seventh studio album &quot;Loud Pack&quot; on Hypnotize Minds and his newly founded label Project.

===2012–present: Mixtapes and &quot;Mista Don&#x27;t Play 2&quot;===
On March 28, 2013, Houston announced that his next album would be titled &quot;Mista Don&#x27;t Play 2&quot;. The album would be released by E1 Music, the first single will be &quot;Be A G&quot;, and feature Juicy J, along with the late Doe B. Juicy J also produces half of the album. The album was released on April 14, 2015.

On August 15, 2016, Houston appeared on the J. Sims song &quot;Visa&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;Mattrix Mixtape: We&#x27;re Going Worldwide, Vol 5&quot; compilation, presented by Matthew Rix. He announced a mixtape titled &quot;M.O.B.&quot; which was released on September 8, 2017.

In 2021, Project Pat was featured on the single &quot;Knife Talk&quot; on Drake&#x27;s album &quot;Certified Lover Boy&quot; which reached number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 2023, Pat collaborated with Juicy J on a joint album titled, &quot;THEM GOATS&quot;.

In 2024, Pat was featured on the song &quot;Sked&quot; alongside Denzel Curry and Kenny Mason. He was also featured on Christian rapper, Dee-1’s song “All Glory to God”.

==Personal life==
Project Pat often visits prisons to perform motivational speaking. He is the founder of the Go Foundation, a Collierville, Tennessee-based nonprofit organization that focuses on prison ministry. 

On January 10, 2025, Houston&#x27;s son Patrick Houston Jr. was fatally shot in the Imogene Heights neighborhood of Memphis.

<text>Carl Ruggles (born Charles Sprague Ruggles; March 11, 1876 – October 24, 1971) was an American composer, painter and teacher. His pieces employed &quot;dissonant counterpoint&quot;, a term coined by fellow composer and musicologist Charles Seeger to describe Ruggles&#x27; music. His method of atonal counterpoint was based on a non-serial technique of avoiding repeating a pitch class until a generally fixed number of eight pitch classes intervened. He is considered a founder of the ultramodernist movement of American composers that included Henry Cowell and Ruth Crawford Seeger, among others. He had no formal musical education, yet was an extreme perfectionist—writing music at a painstakingly slow rate and leaving behind a very small output.

Famous for his prickly personality, Ruggles was nonetheless close friends with Cowell, Seeger, Edgard Varèse, Charles Ives, and the painter Thomas Hart Benton. His students include the experimental composers James Tenney and Merton Brown. Conductor Michael Tilson Thomas has championed Ruggles&#x27; music, recording the complete works with the Buffalo Philharmonic and occasionally performing &quot;Sun-Treader&quot; with the San Francisco Symphony. Especially later in life, Ruggles was also a prolific painter, selling hundreds of paintings during his lifetime.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Carl Ruggles was born in Marion, Massachusetts on March 11, 1876. His surname comes from the town of Rugeley in Staffordshire, England, whose various inhabitants emigrated to Boston in the year 1637. Many of Ruggles&#x27; ancestors served important military and political positions in the early Massachusetts colony, including generals and captains, as well as Micah Haskell Ruggles, a former representative to the Massachusetts General Court (1833–38).

He was born to parents Nathaniel Ruggles and Maria Josephine Ruggles (&quot;née&quot; Hodge), a native of New Hampshire and step-cousin of former U.S. president Franklin Pierce. The young Carl developed an interest in music early on, crafting his own violin from a cigar box at age six. He recalled his mother, Maria, singing him traditional songs from Stephen C. Foster and other folk hymns. Ruggles would receive a quarter size violin from a local lighthouse keeper, and continued learning to play by ear. According to Ruggles, &quot;I began to play hornpipes and jigs by ear—I couldn&#x27;t read a note—people would come for miles to hear me play those hornpipes.&quot; In 1885, when then-president Grover Cleveland spent a summer at Marion, he would attend one of Ruggles&#x27; roadside performances, and the nine year-old Carl played a series of violin duets with first lady Rose Cleveland.

Ruggles&#x27; mother Maria died when he was fourteen years old, and he was thereafter raised by his father and grandmother in nearby Lexington. Ruggles&#x27; father became an alcoholic after his wife&#x27;s death, and was rumored to have a gambling addiction that cost most of the family&#x27;s inherited wealth. Ruggles was never very close to his father and did not see him from the age of 29 onwards. He modified his given name &quot;Charles&quot; to the more Teutonic &quot;Carl&quot; at an early age, partially due to his great admiration for German composers, especially Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss. Though he never legally changed it, he signed all documents and works in his adult life &quot;Carl Ruggles&quot;. He was appointed director of the YMCA orchestra in 1892. A reviewer wrote: &quot;A musical program of entertainment was rendered in the church, each number of which received hearty applause. Master Charles Ruggles&#x27; violin selections were rendered with much feeling and delicacy. He captivated the audience by his manly bearing, and is evidently at home in the concert room.&quot;

==Career==
In 1899, C.W. Thompson &amp; Co. published Ruggles&#x27; first compositions, three songs titled &quot;How Can I Be Blythe and Glad&quot;, &quot;At Sea&quot; and &quot;Maiden with Thy Mouth of Roses&quot;. The first song is one of two surviving compositions from his early days; all others are presumed to have been destroyed by Ruggles himself. Eventually Ruggles had to work to support himself as his family&#x27;s financial situation worsened. He worked a number of odd jobs and started to teach violin and music theory privately, though teaching did not provide much income or success. In 1902 he started writing music criticism for the &quot;Belmont Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Watertown Tribune&quot;. This continued until July 1903. Ruggles&#x27; reviews are characteristically brash. He did not hesitate to express his opinion, laudatory or not.

In 1906, he met Charlotte Snell, a contralto. Ruggles began a search for steady employment so that he and Charlotte could marry. This led him to Winona, Minnesota, to work for the Mar D&#x27;Mar School of Music as a violin teacher. He became active as a soloist as well, eventually directing the Winona Symphony Orchestra. Charlotte joined him as a vocal teacher at Mar d&#x27;Mar. Ruggles continued to direct the symphony after the music school closed. Charlotte then was a choir mistress at the First Baptist Church and Ruggles was hired to conduct the YMCA orchestra and glee club. They also took private students.

In 1912 Ruggles moved to New York and began writing an opera based on the German play &quot;The Sunken Bell&quot; by Gerhart Hauptmann. Due to both his sluggish composing pace and anti-German sentiment as a result of World War I, he never finished the opera, though he submitted a version to the Metropolitan Opera. He destroyed what he had written after he decided he lacked the instinct required for the stage. Ruggles continued to compose, supplementing his income by giving composition lessons. For his son&#x27;s fourth birthday in 1919 he wrote &quot;Toys&quot; for soprano and piano, his first composition in his atonal, contrapuntal style. 
==Later life and death==
He continued to live and compose in New York until 1938, when he began teaching composition at the University of Miami, where he remained until 1943. He then moved to a converted one-room school in Vermont where he spent his time revising compositions and painting. He also painted hundreds of paintings over the course of his lifetime and he was offered the opportunity to have one-man shows.

He was elected to membership in the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1963.

According to Donal Henahan, Ruggles &quot;spoke with an earthiness that shocked many people. He smoked cigars and told dirty stories. He attacked his fellow composers, sneering at almost everyone but Ives. He refused to play the part of the genteel artist.&quot; Known for his profanity, Ruggles was also antisemitic. For example, he wrote to Henry Cowell about, &quot;that filthy bunch of Juilliard Jews ... cheap, without dignity, and with little or no talent,&quot; especially targeting Arthur Berger. His friend Lou Harrison dissociated himself from Ruggles after the 1949 performance of &quot;Angels&quot; because of the older composer&#x27;s racism, noting specifically a luncheon at Pennsylvania Station in New York at which Ruggles shouted anti-black and antisemitic slurs.
===Death===
Ruggles&#x27; wife died in 1957. They had one son, Micah. Ruggles died in Bennington, Vermont, on October 24, 1971, after a long illness.

==Music==
===Overview===
Ruggles&#x27; compositional style was &quot;trial and error. He sat at the piano and moved his fingers around, listened hard to the sounds... shouting out some of the lines.&quot; According to Ruggles himself, he never learned any music theory and never analyzed other composers&#x27; pieces. The majority of his early works (before &quot;Toys&quot;) were destroyed, leaving their compositional style a matter of speculation. Reviews suggest similarities to late 19th-century romanticism.

His dissonant, contrapuntal style is similar to Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s, although he did not employ the same twelve-tone system. He used a method similar to and perhaps influenced by Charles Seeger&#x27;s dissonant counterpoint, and generally avoided repeating a pitch class within eight notes. He also never used sprechstimme in any vocal works, although he admired Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;. He only completed ten pieces due to his lengthy process of composition and revision.

&quot;Sun-Treader&quot;, his best known work, is scored for a large orchestra. It was inspired by the poem &quot;Pauline&quot; by Robert Browning, particularly the line &quot;Sun-treader, light and life be thine forever!&quot;. (Although Browning does not name him, he was referring to Percy Bysshe Shelley.) The most common intervals in the piece are minor seconds, perfect fourths and augmented fourths. One group of intervals he uses are fourths in sequence where the respective notes are either 13 or 11 semitones apart; the other is three notes which are chromatically related, though often separated by an octave. Another distinctive feature of &quot;Sun-Treader&quot; is the presence of &quot;waves&quot;, both in dynamics and pitch. Pitches will start low, then rise up to a climax, then descend again. Within the ascent (and descent) there are small descents (and ascents) leading to a self-similar (fractal) overall structure. &quot;Sun-Treader&quot; premiered in Paris on February 25, 1932. Jean Martinon conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra in its U.S. premiere in Portland, Maine, on January 24, 1966, as part of a Bowdoin College tribute marking Ruggles&#x27; 90th birthday.

Ruggles is one of the composers, collectively known as The &quot;American Five&quot; alongside other American modernist composers Charles Ives (1874–1954), John J. Becker (1886–1961), Wallingford Riegger (1885–1961) and Henry Cowell (1897–1965).

Ruggles&#x27;s music was published by Theodore Presser Company.

Given the size of his catalogue, Ruggles&#x27; discography is not large, with &quot;Sun-Treader&quot; and &quot;Men and Mountains&quot; appearing most frequently, usually in anthologies of 20th Century American music. To date, only one album has been devoted to his output alone: &quot;The Complete Music of Carl Ruggles&quot;, featuring the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, was released in 1980 by CBS Masterworks, and as the title implies, collects all Ruggles&#x27; surviving works on two LPs. It was most recently re-released as part of a Tilson Thomas retrospective on Sony Classics.

<text>In linear algebra, two &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices and are called similar if there exists an invertible &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix such that
formula_1
Similar matrices represent the same linear map under two (possibly) different bases, with being the change-of-basis matrix.

A transformation is called a similarity transformation or conjugation of the matrix . In the general linear group, similarity is therefore the same as [[conjugacy class|conjugacy]], and similar matrices are also called conjugate; however, in a given subgroup of the general linear group, the notion of conjugacy may be more restrictive than similarity, since it requires that be chosen to lie in .

== Motivating example ==

When defining a linear transformation, it can be the case that a change of basis can result in a simpler form of the same transformation. For example, the matrix representing a rotation in when the axis of rotation is not aligned with the coordinate axis can be complicated to compute. If the axis of rotation were aligned with the positive -axis, then it would simply be
formula_2
where formula_3 is the angle of rotation. In the new coordinate system, the transformation would be written as 
formula_4
where and are respectively the original and transformed vectors in a new basis containing a vector parallel to the axis of rotation. In the original basis, the transform would be written as
formula_5
where vectors and and the unknown transform matrix are in the original basis. To write in terms of the simpler matrix, we use the change-of-basis matrix that transforms and as formula_6 and formula_7:
formula_8

Thus, the matrix in the original basis, formula_9, is given by formula_10. The transform in the original basis is found to be the product of three easy-to-derive matrices. In effect, the similarity transform operates in three steps: change to a new basis (), perform the simple transformation (), and change back to the old basis ().

== Properties ==
Similarity is an equivalence relation on the space of square matrices.

Because matrices are similar if and only if they represent the same linear operator with respect to (possibly) different bases, similar matrices share all properties of their shared underlying operator:

*Rank
*Characteristic polynomial, and attributes that can be derived from it:
**Determinant
**Trace
**Eigenvalues, and their algebraic multiplicities
*Geometric multiplicities of eigenvalues (but not the eigenspaces, which are transformed according to the base change matrix &quot;P&quot; used).
*Minimal polynomial
*Frobenius normal form
*Jordan normal form, up to a permutation of the Jordan blocks
*Index of nilpotence 
*Elementary divisors, which form a complete set of invariants for similarity of matrices over a principal ideal domain

Because of this, for a given matrix &quot;A&quot;, one is interested in finding a simple &quot;normal form&quot; &quot;B&quot; which is similar to &quot;A&quot;—the study of &quot;A&quot; then reduces to the study of the simpler matrix &quot;B&quot;. For example, &quot;A&quot; is called diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix. Not all matrices are diagonalizable, but at least over the complex numbers (or any algebraically closed field), every matrix is similar to a matrix in Jordan form. Neither of these forms is unique (diagonal entries or Jordan blocks may be permuted) so they are not really normal forms; moreover their determination depends on being able to factor the minimal or characteristic polynomial of &quot;A&quot; (equivalently to find its eigenvalues). The rational canonical form does not have these drawbacks: it exists over any field, is truly unique, and it can be computed using only arithmetic operations in the field; &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are similar if and only if they have the same rational canonical form. The rational canonical form is determined by the elementary divisors of &quot;A&quot;; these can be immediately read off from a matrix in Jordan form, but they can also be determined directly for any matrix by computing the Smith normal form, over the ring of polynomials, of the matrix (with polynomial entries) (the same one whose determinant defines the characteristic polynomial). Note that this Smith normal form is not a normal form of &quot;A&quot; itself; moreover it is not similar to either, but obtained from the latter by left and right multiplications by different invertible matrices (with polynomial entries).

Similarity of matrices does not depend on the base field: if &quot;L&quot; is a field containing &quot;K&quot; as a subfield, and &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are two matrices over &quot;K&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are similar as matrices over &quot;K&quot; if and only if they are similar as matrices over &quot;L&quot;. This is so because the rational canonical form over &quot;K&quot; is also the rational canonical form over &quot;L&quot;. This means that one may use Jordan forms that only exist over a larger field to determine whether the given matrices are similar.

In the definition of similarity, if the matrix &quot;P&quot; can be chosen to be a permutation matrix then &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are permutation-similar; if &quot;P&quot; can be chosen to be a unitary matrix then &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are unitarily equivalent. The spectral theorem says that every normal matrix is unitarily equivalent to some diagonal matrix. Specht&#x27;s theorem states that two matrices are unitarily equivalent if and only if they satisfy certain trace equalities.

<doc id="341161" wikidata="Q936573" url="?curid=341161" title="Crunk">
<text>Crunk is a subgenre of southern hip hop that emerged in the early 1990s and gained mainstream success during the early to mid 2000s. Crunk is often up-tempo and one of Southern hip hop&#x27;s more nightclub-oriented subgenres. Distinguishing itself with other Southern hip hop subgenres, crunk is marked and characterized by its energetic accelerated musical tempo, club appeal, recurrent chants frequently executed in a call and response manner, multilayered synths, its pronounced reliance on resounding 808 basslines, and rudimentary musical arrangement. An archetypal crunk track frequently uses a dominant groove composed of a nuanced utilization of intricately multilayered keyboard synthesizers organized in a recurring pattern, seamlessly shifting from a lower to a higher pitch that encompasses the song&#x27;s primary central rhythm, both in terms of its harmonic and melodic aspects. The main groove is then wrapped up with looped, stripped-down, and crisp 808 dance claps and manipulated snare rolls coupled and accompanied by a bassline of thumping 808 kick drums. The term &quot;crunk&quot; was also used throughout the 2000s as a blanket term to denote any style of Southern hip hop, a side effect of the genre&#x27;s breakthrough to the mainstream. The word derives from its African-American Vernacular English past-participle form, &quot;crunk&quot;, of the verb &quot;to crank&quot; (as in the phrase &quot;crank up&quot;). It refers to being excited or high on drugs.

==Etymology==
The term has been attributed mainly to African-American slang, in which it holds various meanings. It most commonly refers to the verb phrase &quot;to crank up&quot;. It is theorized that the use of the term came from a past-tense form of &quot;crank&quot;, which was sometimes conjugated as &quot;crunk&quot; in the South, such that if a person, event, or party was hyped-up, i.e. energetic – &quot;cranked&quot; or &quot;cranked up&quot; – it was said to be &quot;crunk&quot;.

In publications, &quot;crunk&quot; can be traced back to 1972 in the Dr. Seuss book &quot;Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!&quot;. He uses the term &quot;Crunk-Car&quot; without any given definition. The term has also been traced to usage in the 1980s coming out of Atlanta, Georgia nightclubs and meaning being &quot;full of energy&quot; or &quot;hyped&quot;. In the mid-1990s, crunk was variously defined either as &quot;hype&quot;, &quot;phat&quot;, or &quot;pumped up&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine published &quot;glossary of Dirty South slang&quot;, where &quot;to crunk&quot; was defined as &quot;to get excited&quot;.

Outkast has been attributed as the first artist to use the term in mainstream music, in the 1993 track &quot;Player&#x27;s Ball&quot;. A seminal year for the genre was 1996, with the releases of Three 6 Mafia album &quot;Chapter 1: The End&quot; (featuring &quot;Gette&#x27;m Crunk&quot;), and Memphis-based underground hip hop artist Tommy Wright III&#x27;s album &quot;On the Run&quot;, which featured the Project Pimp track &quot;Getting Crunk&quot;.

Rapper and record producer Lil Jon was instrumental in bringing the term further into the mainstream music scene with his 1997 album titled &quot;Get Crunk, Who U Wit: Da Album&quot;. He later released other songs and albums using the term, and has been credited by other artists and musicians as galvanizing use of the term as well as mainstreaming the music genre itself.

Lil Jon further popularized the word with his 2004 album &quot;Crunk Juice&quot;, and has been credited with inventing the potent alcoholic cocktail by that name. This use of &quot;crunk&quot; became synonymous with the meaning &quot;crazy drunk&quot;. Non-alcoholic drinks, to which alcohol could be added, were manufactured and marketed under the Crunk brand name, with Lil Jon as spokesman.

The term has continued to evolve, taking on a negative stigma with police, parents and the media. In 2011, the company which manufactured &quot;Crunk&quot; drink brought out an alcoholic version named &quot;Crunk Juice&quot;. This drink was allegedly marketed towards 19- to 21-year-olds – those under the US legal drinking age – resulting in Crunk Juice drinking being blamed as a cause of crime or becoming a victim of crime. The mainstream media began publishing stories in which the term &quot;crunk&quot; was used to refer to &quot;crazy and drunk&quot; criminals.

==Musical characteristics==
Musically, crunk is heavily influenced by Miami bass, Eurodance, and 1980s-era call-and-response hip hop. The distinguishing feature of the conventional crunk sound is characterized by its extensive utilization of multilayered synthesizers orchestrated in a recurrent arrangement that seamlessly transitions from a lower to a higher pitch to augment the sound&#x27;s harmonious and melodic qualities. Furthermore, a crunk composition is also complemented by the presence of resonant 808 bass kick drums, textured with crisp 808 dance-oriented hand claps, and adorned with modulated snare rolls. Looped, stripped-down drum machine dance claps and snare rolls coupled with heavy 808 bassline drum rhythms are usually used. The Roland TR-808 and 909 are among the most popular instruments to create crunk compositions with. The drum machines are usually accompanied by simple, repeated synthesizer melodies in the form of ostinato, to create a hypnotic effect, and heavy 808 bass stabs. The tempo of Lil Jon&#x27;s &quot;Get Crunk&quot; is 78 BPM. 

The focal point of crunk is more often emphasized on the beat structure rather than the lyrical content therein. Nevertheless, artists like Lil Jon often convey their lyrics through vigorous vocalization, encompassing chanting, shouting, and screaming. This unconventional approach yields a cacophonous yet intense manifestation of southern hip hop, characterized by its assertive, aggressive, and forceful nature. These lyrics can often be isolated to simple chants (&quot;Where you from?&quot; and &quot;You can&#x27;t fuck with me&quot; are common examples). Compared with other regional hip hop scenes around the United States, crunk has remained one of American hip hop&#x27;s club-oriented staples, given the subgenre&#x27;s particular focus on its allure to club audiences and partygoers who exhibit more energetic musical tastes with a penchant for more dynamic and vibrant musical preferences. Crunk&#x27;s captivating appeal is expertly tailored to befit the ambient dance floors of Atlanta&#x27;s southern hip hop nightclub scene, opting for simplistic and repetitious call and response vocal refrains in lieu of more substantive approaches.

==History==
===Origins===
Crunk music arose from Miami bass music before 1996 in the southern United States, particularly in African American strip clubs of Memphis, Tennessee. Memphis-based hip hop group Three 6 Mafia were &quot;instrumental for the emergence of the crunk style&quot; in the mid-to-late 1990s. Two mixtape DJs from Memphis, DJ Paul and Juicy J, started making their original music, which was distinctive with its &quot;spare, low-BPM rhythms, simplistic chants... and narcotically repetitive, slasher-flick textures&quot;. This duo soon became known as Three 6 Mafia. Frequently featuring rappers such as Project Pat, Lord Infamous, Gangsta Boo, and La Chat on their releases, they became instrumental in the formation of crunk music.

In 1997, in Atlanta, Lil Jon, with his group the East Side Boyz, released their first album titled &quot;Get Crunk, Who U Wit&quot;. These were the first of six albums released by Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz. &quot;The New York Times&quot; denied that &quot;Get Crunk, Who Are You With&quot; was the first crunk album ever. He was one of the key figures in popularizing crunk during 1998 and 1999, and produced two gold records independently, before signing to TVT Records in 2001. After being named the &quot;King of Crunk&quot;, Lil Jon went on to make collaborations with many rappers such as Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Ludacris and pop singer Britney Spears. Nevertheless, crunk was not exclusively associated with Lil Jon and Three 6 Mafia. In its early stages, soloists and groups such as Ying Yang Twins, White Dawg, Bone Crusher, Lil Scrappy, Trillville, YoungBloodZ and Pastor Troy from Atlanta, and David Banner from Mississippi also helped to popularize crunk music.

===Popularity and evolution===
By the early to mid-2000s, some crunk music hits such as &quot;Damn!&quot;, &quot;Salt Shaker&quot;, &quot;Get Low&quot;, &quot;Goodies&quot;, &quot;Yeah!&quot; and &quot;Freek-a-Leek&quot; produced by Lil Jon climbed to the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. Other hits produced by Lil Jon included &quot;Shorty Wanna Ride&quot;, &quot;Presidential&quot;, &quot;Lovers and Friends&quot;, &quot;Okay&quot;, &quot;Come Get Some&quot;, &quot;Tell Me When to Go&quot;, &quot;Cyclone&quot;, &quot;Girlfight&quot;, &quot;U and Dat&quot;, and &quot;Touch&quot;. &quot;Yeah!&quot; and &quot;Goodies&quot; were the first tracks to introduce the fusion substyle of crunk music and contemporary R&amp;B, called crunk&amp;B to the mainstream popular music landscape. Those two tracks (performed by Usher and Ciara, respectively) were the mainstream crunk hits of 2004.

The 2003 crunk song &quot;Get Low&quot; (2003), performed by Lil Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz with the Ying Yang Twins, is credited as the track which put crunk music into the national spotlight within the mainstream popular music landscape. &quot;Get Low&quot; reached the number two position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 music chart; overall, it spent more than 21 weeks in the charts. Lil Jon&#x27;s album, titled &quot;Kings of Crunk&quot;, which contained &quot;Get Low&quot;, earned a double platinum certification from the RIAA. In the past, rappers who did not originate from the Southern regions of the United States had previously shown reluctance in aligning themselves with being linked to the emerging Southern hip hop scene during the early 21st-century. However, this narrative began to shift when both Busta Rhymes, an East coast rapper, and Nelly, a mid-west rap soloist from St. Louis, agreed to collaborate and contribute their talents to remixes of the song &quot;Get Low&quot;.

In 2004, the independent record label Crunk Incorporated signed a major distribution deal with Reprise/Warner Bros. Records for the crunk group Crime Mob, who released their platinum single &quot;Knuck If You Buck&quot;. They followed this with their 2006 hit, &quot;Rock Yo Hips&quot;. In March 2004, R&amp;B singer Houston released his crunk&amp;B hit &quot;I Like That&quot;, which reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. During the same year, Atlanta-based R&amp;B singer Nivea scored a mainstream hit when her 2004 crunk&amp;B single &quot;Okay&quot; reached the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. On August 26, 2004, Nashville-based rapper Young Buck scored a top 20 summer hit single with his crunk song &quot;Shorty Wanna Ride&quot;. The song debuted at number 68 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and peaked at number 17 on the chart, becoming one of Young Buck&#x27;s highest charting singles in his career. In 2005, two crunk&amp;B songs made a presence on the Billboard Hot 100 when the Los Angeles–based R&amp;B singer Brooke Valentine&#x27;s song &quot;Girlfight&quot; reached number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100. Towards the end of 2005, then up-and-coming R&amp;B singer Chris Brown&#x27;s &quot;Run It!&quot; made its run on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it eventually peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one on November 26, 2005, becoming Brown&#x27;s first number one hit single to top the chart. Throughout 2005 to 2006, crunk and crunk&amp;B continued its conquest of the Billboard Hot 100, hip hop, and R&amp;B charts (and other charts specializing in music with rapping) while replacing older styles of hip hop and contemporary R&amp;B. On February 1, 2006, San Francisco–based rapper E-40 released his crunk song, &quot;Tell Me When to Go.&quot; The song was one of the first singles to kick off the hyphy movement on a national level and popularized the phrase &quot;ghost ride the whip.&quot; The song reached number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and eventually earned a Gold certification by the RIAA ten years later in March 2016. He later followed up the hit single with another Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper &quot;U and Dat&quot; released on May 2, 2006, which was a crunk song that was mixed with elements of dirty rap, hyphy, and West Coast hip hop. The song peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, which has since remained as E-40&#x27;s highest-charting single as a lead artist to date with the song eventually garnering platinum certification for exceeding 1 million in certified sales by March 2016. Atlanta-based R&amp;B girl group Cherish also gained national prominence with their summer 2006 hit single &quot;Do It to It&quot; where the song debuted at number 86 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for the week of May 20, 2006, later peaking at number 12 for the week of September 2, 2006, and staying on the charts for 21 weeks. On September 12, 2006, disc jockey DJ Webstar and rapper Young B released their crunk song, &quot;Chicken Noodle Soup.&quot; The song reached number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 by October 21, 2006 and eventually garnered a gold certification from the RIAA. 

On April 10, 2007, Louisiana-based rapper Hurricane Chris released his hit debut single &quot;A Bay Bay&quot;, which debuted at number 95 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In its second week, the song rose to number 85; in its third week, it rose 61 places to number 24. The single featured archetypal crunk elements with the song eventually peaking at number 7 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Rapper Baby Bash released his hit crunk single Cyclone, which debuted at number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early August 2007. The song would then reach the top 40 at number 33 on September 15, 2007, and peaked at number 7 by November 3, 2007, for two weeks before being certified double platinum by the RIAA. Houston-based rapper Dorrough&#x27;s 2009 hit single &quot;Ice Cream Paint Job&quot; marked as one of the last crunk tracks to top the Hot 100, alongside various other crunk compositions that had infiltrated the Billboard charts throughout the 2000s. By the end of 2009, crunk had experienced a significant decrease in visibility within the American mainstream music scene after the conclusion of the 2000s, evident by the changes that took place when the genre was eventually superseded by surging popularity of the trap and drill music subgenres as well as the upsurge in the growth of electropop, electrohop, electro-soul and electronic dance music by the early 2010s. The growing interest in crunk music among record producers outside the Southern hip hop music scene led to the development of various subgenres of crunk, including Eurocrunk, crunkcore, crunkczar, aquacrunk, acid crunk and trap, which gained mainstream music popularity throughout the 2010s. The mainstream popular music scene did not witness a minor resurgence of crunk until the mid-2010s, when the American R&amp;B singer Tinashe incorporated crunk and snap elements in her 2015 single &quot;All Hands on Deck&quot; featuring Australian rapper Iggy Azalea. The song contained themes of girl power, rebound dating, and self empowerment. The secondary revival of crunk in the realm of mainstream popular music did not occur until the end of the 2010s, when the San Francisco–based female rapper Saweetie sampled Petey Pablo&#x27;s 2004 crunk hit &quot;Freek-a-Leek&quot; for her 2019 hit single &quot;My Type.&quot; The song marked as one of the last crunk compositions to achieve significant mainstream success on the US Billboard 100 as the decade came to a conclusion.

<text>A chase plane is an aircraft that &quot;chases&quot; a &quot;subject&quot; aircraft, spacecraft or rocket, for the purposes of making real-time observations and taking air-to-air photographs and video of the subject vehicle during flight.

==Background==
Safety can be one function of a chase plane; others are to photograph or video the target vehicle, or to collect engineering data from it. Chase planes may be used during flight tests, and for many years the best way to ensure the safety of an experimental aircraft was to fly alongside it and observe the flight.

This &quot;chase&quot; airplane&#x27;s crew would keep a constant lookout for problems with the &quot;subject&quot; or test aircraft, and if problems did arise, they would provide warnings and critical information to the test aircraft&#x27;s crew, and to the mission controllers on the ground. They would also monitor the surrounding airspace for other aircraft that could pose a hazard to the flight, either by straying into their flightpath or threatening any kind of secrecy associated with that particular project. 

Since the early days of United States Air Force testing, the chase aircraft have been crewed by test pilots just like the experimental planes they accompany, providing a common language and bond between test pilot and observer. The experienced pilots in the chase aircraft could guide distressed test aircraft down to safe landings should experiments go wrong.

<text>UGK (short for Underground Kingz) was an American rap duo from Port Arthur, Texas, formed in 1987, by Mitchell “Big Mitch” Queen who would eventually leave the group to pursue a football career and Chad &quot;Pimp C&quot; Butler with Bernard “Bun B” Freeman replacing Big Mitch who would still make guest appearances on UGK songs. They released their first major-label album, &quot;Too Hard to Swallow&quot;, in 1992, followed by several other albums charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, including the self-titled &quot;Underground Kingz&quot; album, which contained their single &quot;International Players Anthem (I Choose You)&quot; and debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, in August 2007. The duo has also been featured on hit singles by several other artists, such as &quot;Big Pimpin&#x27;&quot; by Jay-Z and &quot;Sippin&#x27; on Some Syrup&quot; by Three 6 Mafia. Pimp C founded UGK Records in late 2005. On December 4, 2007, Pimp C died in his West Hollywood, California hotel room.

==Background==
Originally from Port Arthur, Texas UGK members Pimp and Bun were from the same town as Janis Joplin and Robert Rauschenberg. Though the town of 60,000 has a significant African American population, it was not known for its rap scene. They called themselves &quot;Underground Kingz&quot; because their country rap style was so full of &quot;slang and twang&quot; they thought it inaccessible for outsiders. UGK blended &quot;deep bluesy texures, triumphant church organs, thick funk and meaty soul&quot;. 

Bun&#x27;s rap style was described as a &quot;speeding-train delivery&quot; with lyrics that &quot;feel sanded-down and coated by heavy lacquer&quot;. Born Bernard Freeman, his childhood nickname &quot;Bunny&quot; was shortened to Bun. 

Pimp, or Chad Butler, is the son of a trumpet player and has had an interest in music since childhood: &quot;I come from a classical background, I came up singing Italian sonnets, Negro spirituals, and shit of that nature.&quot; Even before studying musical notation in school he learned to play many instruments by ear including piano, trumpet, drums and flugelhorn. His vocal style is of a &quot;high-voiced, unstable and provocateur, as likely to slap your face as to sing you a love song&quot;. Influenced by Run-DMC, he started synthesizing beats to rap over after receiving a drum machine and keyboard one Christmas. Following the advice of Pimp&#x27;s stepfather to &quot;put some music in that shit&quot;, Pimp decided to move beyond Run-DMC&#x27;s kick-snare formula, opting instead for 808s and especially hi-hats.

==Career and recordings==
In 1992, UGK was signed to Jive Records under a five-album contract, releasing their major-label debut album &quot;Too Hard to Swallow&quot;. While it featured several new recordings, it also featured several songs that had been culled from &quot;The Southern Way&quot;. However, several songs that had been intended to be included on the album were excised at the last minute, apparently due to their overly explicit content. Five of these songs would surface two months before the release of &quot;Too Hard to Swallow&quot;, on an EP distributed by Bigtyme Recordz; appropriately enough, the EP was titled &quot;Banned&quot;. A popular song from the album &quot;Pocket Full of Stones&quot; was also included on the Menace II Society soundtrack in 1993.

Their second album, &quot;Super Tight&quot;, was released two years later, on August 30. Unlike their previous album, &quot;Super Tight&quot; managed to break into the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and ultimately peaked at #95; their third album, &quot;Ridin&#x27; Dirty&quot;, peaked at #15. &quot;Ridin&#x27; Dirty&quot; would also be UGK&#x27;s last album for the time being, as they went on a five-year hiatus not long afterward.

The year 2000 became a breakthrough year for the group. UGK made a high-profile guest appearance on Jay-Z&#x27;s smash hit &quot;Big Pimpin&#x27;&quot; and also appeared on Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s hit &quot;Sippin&#x27; on Some Syrup&quot;. Both of these collaborations greatly increased their reputation, and helped fuel anticipation for their next project . Jive Records failed to capitalize on this new-found interest in the duo, as their fourth album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Money&quot;, came and went with little fanfare.

Further problems arose when Pimp C was incarcerated for an aggravated gun assault charge in 2002. Throughout the time of his incarceration, Bun B carried on the UGK name by making numerous guest appearances on songs by other artists, with every appearance either mentioning Pimp C or featuring a &quot;Free Pimp C!&quot; or &quot;Free the Pimp&quot; chant. Many of UGK&#x27;s peers did the same, and mentioned Pimp C in their own songs with or without Bun B. During this period, Jive Records released a &quot;Best of UGK&quot; album, as well as a Chopped &amp; Screwed remix album. As a result of Pimp C&#x27;s incarceration, both members of UGK began solo careers out of necessity.

Rap-A-Lot Records released Pimp C&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Sweet James Jones Stories&quot;, on March 1, 2005. Bun B later released his own solo foray, &quot;Trill&quot;, on October 18, 2005. It opened at #6 on the Billboard Hot 200, and also peaked at #1 on Billboard&#x27;s Top R&amp;B/Hip-hop Album chart.

On December 30, 2005, Pimp C was released from prison and was to be on parole until December 2009. He released his first post-incarceration album, titled &quot;Pimpalation&quot;, on July 25, 2006.

On August 7, 2007, the group released their fifth studio album, the self-titled &quot;Underground Kingz&quot;. It was a double album, containing 26 tracks and spanning two discs. Featured guests included Talib Kweli, Too Short, Rick Ross, Z-RO, Three 6 Mafia, Slim Thug, OutKast, as well as hip-hop legends Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane on a Marley Marl-produced track titled &quot;Next Up&quot;. The album also featured British rapper Dizzee Rascal on the track &quot;Two Types of Bitches&quot;, following UGK&#x27;s guest appearance in Rascal&#x27;s own album &quot;Maths + English&quot; for the track &quot;Where&#x27;s Da G&#x27;s&quot;. The album featured production by DJ Paul &amp; Juicy J, Jazze Pha, Swizz Beatz, The Runners, Lil Jon, fellow Texas legend Scarface, and Pimp C. DJ Paul and Juicy J produced the second single, &quot;International Player&#x27;s Anthem (I Choose You)&quot;.

The album got a positive reception, both commercially and critically. It received a 4-star rating from Allmusic, and reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 200 album charts. &quot;International Player&#x27;s Anthem (I Choose You)&quot; became the group&#x27;s only single to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop charts, where it peaked at #70.

===2007–2009: Death of Pimp C and breakup===
On December 4, 2007, Pimp C was found dead at the Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood, California, after Los Angeles County Fire Department responded to a 9-1-1 call. They arrived to his sixth-floor hotel room to find him dead in bed. This was three days after he performed with Too Short at the House of Blues in Los Angeles.

Bun B was interviewed a few days later by radio DJ Madd Hatta, and an audio recording has been posted online.

In 2008, Bun B stated in an interview that there would be one last UGK album released, before he permanently becomes a solo act: &quot;Yea, we’re still putting together this last UGK record too, because there’s a lot of music that we’ve already recorded for it,&quot; said Bun B. &quot;I think that album itself is going to be a little bit weird.&quot; &quot;UGK 4 Life&quot; was released in 2009.

==Style and influences==
Bun B said that they grew up listening to the Geto Boys, Eric B and Rakim, N.W.A and A Tribe Called Quest. UGK (most notably Pimp C) has also influenced other rappers such as Big Boi of OutKast, Boosie Badazz and Paul Wall.

<text>The Solomon Islands skink (Corucia zebrata), also known as prehensile-tailed skink, monkey-tailed skink, giant skink, zebra skink, and monkey skink, is an arboreal species of skink endemic to the Solomon Islands archipelago. It is the largest known extant species of skink.

The Solomon Islands skink is completely herbivorous, eating many different fruits and vegetables including the pothos plant. It is one of the few species of reptile known to function within a social group or circulus. Both male and female specimens are known to be territorial and often hostile towards members not a part of their family group.

&quot;Corucia&quot; is a monotypic genus, containing a single species. However, in 1997 it was determined that there are two subspecies of the Solomon Islands skink: the common monkey-tailed skink (&quot;Corucia zebrata zebrata&quot;) and the northern monkey-tailed skink (&quot;Corucia zebrata alfredschmidti)&quot;. Among other variances, the northern skink is smaller and has darker eyes with a black sclera.

Extensive logging is a serious threat to the survival of this species. Consumption for food by indigenous Solomon Islanders and excessive pet trade exports have affected wild populations. Export of this species from the Solomon Islands is now restricted and the animal is protected under CITES appendix II.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The Solomon Islands skink was first described by John Edward Gray in 1855 as &quot;Corucia zebrata&quot;. The generic name &quot;Corucia&quot; derives from the Latin word meaning &quot;shimmering&quot;. This is in reference to Gray&#x27;s description of &quot;a play of colors effect from the body scales&quot;. Its specific name &quot;zebrata&quot; is a Latinized form of the word zebra, in reference to the animal&#x27;s zebra-like stripes. Some of its common names (prehensile-tailed skink, monkey-tailed skink, monkey skink) refer to its fully prehensile tail which the species uses as a fifth limb for climbing.

Although appearances of Solomon Island skinks vary from island to island, only one subspecies, from the western islands of the Solomons Archipelago, was described by Dr. Gunther Köhler in 1996 as &quot;C. z. alfredschmidti&quot;, the trinomial name of which is in honor of German amateur herpetologist Alfred A. Schmidt.

The closest living relatives of &quot;C. zebrata&quot; are the blue-tongued skinks of the genus &quot;Tiliqua&quot; and skinks of the genus &quot;Egernia&quot; of Australia, New Guinea, and Indonesia, all of which are also assigned to the subfamily &quot;Lygosominae&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Solomon Islands skink is native to Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands archipelago, a group of islands in the south-west Pacific Ocean. The common subspecies (&quot;C. z. zebrata&quot;) is found on the islands of Choiseul, New Georgia, Santa Isabel, Guadalcanal, Nggela, Malaita, Makira, Ugi and Owaraha. The northern subspecies (&quot;C. z. alfredschmidti)&quot; is known from the islands of Bougainville and Buka and the Shortland Islands. Bougainville and Buka are geographically part of the Solomons Archipelago, though politically part of Papua New Guinea. Both subspecies of the Solomon Islands skink are strictly arboreal, usually inhabiting the upper canopy of forested areas throughout its range. The adults commonly establish a territory within the canopy of one tree. It commonly occurs in the strangler fig tree (&quot;Ficus sp.&quot;), provided the epiphytic growth of its several food plants are present. It occurs in trees in semi-cleared areas and cultivated food gardens, again provided its food plants occur there.

==Biology==

The Solomon Islands skink is the world&#x27;s largest species of extant skink; adults can reach a total length (including tail) of when fully grown, with the tail accounting for more than half this length.

The Solomon Islands skink has a long, slender body, strong, short legs, and a triangular shaped head with small round eyes. The skink has a strong crushing jaw but the teeth are small and used for eating plant material. Its prehensile tail helps it maneuver from branch to branch with ease and gives the skink its more common names: monkey-tailed skink, prehensile-tailed skink, or monkey skink. Male Solomon Islands skinks tend to have a broader head and a more slender body shape than female skinks. Males have a V-shaped pattern of scales just aft of the cloacal opening, which is not present in female skinks.

The scales of Solomon Islands skinks are a dark green but are often speckled with light brown or black. The scales on the underside vary from light yellow to different shades of green. The toes on all four legs have thick, curved nails used for climbing and gripping tree limbs.

As a crepuscular animal, it is most active during the dusk and dawn hours, feeding primarily at dusk. it also is active and eats during the hours of dawn, though to a lesser extent. It has quite good eyesight and relies upon it to identify threats, as well as potential food. It relies heavily on its sense of smell and uses it to identify its territory and other members of its group, called a circulus. Like snakes, the skink &quot;smells&quot; by flicking its tongue to gather scents and when the tongue is retracted, it touches it to the opening of a Jacobson&#x27;s organ at the roof of its mouth.

=== Subspecies ===
The common Solomon Islands skink (&quot;C. z. zebrata&quot;) has a white sclera with its eyes while the northern Solomon Islands skink (&quot;C. z. alfredschmidti)&quot; has a black sclera. The iris of the northern Solomon Islands skink is a mix of green and yellow whereas the iris of the common Solomon Islands skink can vary from several different shades of green to orange to a dark black. According to Dr. Gunther Köhler, who described the northern subspecies, this subspecies possesses &quot;larger dorsal and ventral scales&quot; and has &quot;seven instead of usually five parietal scales&quot;.

The northern Solomon Islands skink is the shorter of the two subspecies with males averaging and females averaging in total length. The common Solomon Islands skinks are slightly longer with the males averaging and the females averaging in total length. The common Solomon Islands skink, at , weighs more than the northern Solomon Islands skink, which weighs closer to .

===Diet===
Solomon Islands skinks are herbivores, feeding on the leaves, flowers, fruit, and growing shoots of several different species of plants. This includes the somewhat toxic (due to high concentrations of calcium oxalate) &quot;Epipremnum pinnatum (cf. E. aureum)&quot; plant, which the lizard eats without ill effect. Juvenile skinks often eat feces from adults in order to acquire the essential microflora to digest their food. Newborn skinks have been observed consuming their placental sac after birth and will not feed on other food for the first two days. A study done in 2000 showed that this species still exhibits a feed response based on chemical cues from insects. It is believed that this is an ancestral trait that these skinks have retained, though it is not used in the wild.

===Reproduction===
The Solomon Islands skink is one of the few species of reptile that lives in a communal group known as a circulus. The Solomon Islands skink reproduces by viviparous matrotrophy: the female provides a placenta for its young, which are born after a gestation period of six to eight months; this is a rare trait among reptiles. The newborn skink is of a large size compared to its mother; the northern Solomon Islands skinks are approximately in length and weigh , whereas the common Solomon Islands skinks are and when they are born. This reduced size disparity led the former curator of reptiles at the Philadelphia Zoo, Dr. Kevin Wright, to compare it to &quot;a human mother giving birth to a six year–old&quot;. Almost all births are single babies, but occasionally twins will be born. At least one instance of triplets has occurred according to herpetologist Bert Langerwerf.

The newborn skink will stay within its circulus for six to twelve months during which time it will be protected by not only its parents but other unrelated adult skinks within the group. Around one year of age, sometimes earlier, the juvenile will move off to form a new family group. Individuals have been documented to stay within the group for several births without being expelled, however. Females exhibit fierce protective behavior around the time of birth; this protectiveness of young is a rare occurrence in reptiles but is shorter in duration when compared to the protective behavior exhibited by a typical mammal.

==Conservation==

===Threats===
Extensive logging is a serious ongoing threat to the survival of this species, as is consumption for food by native people, and export demand for the pet trade. Because of the large numbers of lizards that were being exported for the pet trade, the small region to which the skink is native, and its low reproductive rate, in 1992 &quot;Corucia zebrata&quot; was listed as a CITES Appendix II animal, which allows limits to be placed on the number of animals in commercial trade between countries.

Since there is no regulation on the rapid deforestation occurring in the Solomon Islands, limited export to recognized institutions may be needed to aid this species in genetic diversity for its survival via &quot;ex situ&quot; breeding programs. According to herpetologists who study the Solomon Islands skink, such as Dr. David Kirkpatrick and Dr. Kevin Wright, captive breeding alone is not practical as a sole method of species survival due to the limited number of offspring and long gestation periods.

===In captivity===

The Solomon Islands skink is represented in both public and private collections. The Philadelphia Zoo has bred this species of skink over multiple generations for the past 40 years. The keeping of the Solomon Islands skink in captivity is not without its challenges: as it is a large arboreal tropical animal. It requires a large arboreal enclosure, with a constant temperature between 75–80 degrees Fahrenheit (24–27 degrees Celsius), with heat being provided from above as well as below, allowing the skink to bask in the heat from above as it would during dusk, while providing a radiant heat from below to aid digestion. The dynamics of the skink&#x27;s circulus means that not all groups do well when new animals are introduced. Despite successful breeding programs, its somewhat unusual nature of single births and slow growth has made these programs challenging.

Biologist Michael Balsai of Temple University has noted a significant number of breedings between skinks from different islands has resulted in non-productive unions. Balsai&#x27;s theory is that there are enough differences between animals from different islands that pairing of lizards from different locales will be unproductive, further frustrating many captive breeding attempts.

The genus &quot;Cryptoblepharus&quot; was established in 1834 by the zoologist Arend Friedrich August Wiegmann.
The type species of the genus was not nominated by the author, but this was assigned to &quot;Ablepharus poecilipleurus&quot; Wiegmann, 1834 in a revision by Leonhard Stejneger published in 1899.
An emendation to the name as &quot;Cryptoblepharis&quot; by J. T. Cocteau in 1836 is considered a synonym, as is &quot;Petia&quot;, the name published by John Edward Gray in 1839 without a type or description.

They occupy a fairly basal position among the &quot;Eugongylus&quot; group.

&quot;Cryptoblepharus&quot; species, some of which are often seen in urban environments, are commonly named as fence skinks, or by characteristics such as their lack of eyelids, snake-eyed skinks, or as shining-skinks for their glossy skins.

==Description==
Member species of the genus &quot;Cryptoblepharus&quot; are small-bodied, lack eyelids, are pentadactyl, and have shiny scales. They are able to move rapidly and with great agility, snatching insects from the air and climbing vertical surfaces with ease. They are often observed basking in the sun and disappearing into a hole or crevice in response to a perceived threat. Females may share a site to deposit their eggs, the species returning annually to lay a small clutch.

There are a large number of species, with a distribution range across many continents; they are the most widespread genus of the scincid family. Species are found at the east coast of Africa and on Madagascar in a western Indian Ocean range that is isolated from the species found in a region that includes Australia, Indonesia, New Guinea and the Pacific area. Outlying from the Pacific region are species found at three areas on the west coast of South America.
The species are often associated with vertical, often rocky microhabitats and other niches, foraging and residing on surfaces that lack available water. Cliffs and rocks are typical abodes, sandstone near shorelines in a common habitat for some species, as well as trees in forest environments, and they are known to occur at ground level to forage or commute to another location or in environments that lack this habitat. The species may be locally common to abundant, in numbers up to twenty or thirty at a cliff, rock pile or other favoured site.

All species are oviparous, each female laying several eggs, and sexes are strongly dimorphic, the female distinguished by larger overall size with proportionally shorter head and legs. Detailed aspects of the reproduction activity are poorly known, especially the secretive manner in which the female places the eggs. Several sites of &quot;Cryptoblepharus&quot; species have been located, the include within the inner chambers of ant plants in New Guinea, ant inhabited species of Rubiaceae which also contained the broods of several females.
The ability to occupy vertical environs is favoured by the fences and brick walls of urbanisation, where clusters of eggs have also occasionally been discovered within the cavities, and glimpses of them basking in the sun are frequently made before they rapidly flee any disturbance. When seen on a tree, the arboreal species will continually circle to the opposite side to evade a possible threat.

Feeding is probably opportunistic, any arthropod that is small enough to consume, which is known to include spiders, ants and termites. Trails of winged ants have been observed as feeding opportunities, and some species are recorded seizing dead insects being carried by a line of worker ants. Juvenile fish are also known to be eaten.
These skinks are a source of food to a number of predators, but which species are able to capture them is also poorly surveyed. An individual has been observed as prey to a centipede, albeit when both were trapped (&quot;C. cygnatus&quot;), and they are a known prey item of other lizards, such as the pygopod &quot;Lialis burtonis&quot;.
A revision of Australasian species, published in two papers in 2007, compared morphological and molecular phylogenies and concluded that there was unrecognised diversity within the genus.
The author, of the Northern Territory Museum, published revised systematics that sampled widely distributed populations in the Australian region, with small samples of taxa from other regions, to identify twenty five taxa in Australia, another thirteen in the southwest of the Indian oceanic area, and a further twenty four in the Indo-Pacific, listing 62 taxonomic descriptions of the genus in total.

<text>Ctenotus is a genus of skinks, lizards in the family Scincidae. The genus is endemic to Australia. The genus &quot;Ctenotus&quot; belongs to a clade in the &quot;Sphenomorphus&quot; group which contains such genera as &quot;Anomalopus&quot; and the close relatives &quot;Eulamprus&quot; and &quot;Gnypetoscincus&quot;.

Lizards in the genus &quot;Ctenotus&quot; are commonly called comb-eared skinks, a reference to the scales aligned near the ear. &quot;Ctenotus&quot; lizards are able to move very quickly, disappearing whilst being observed. They are highly active in their habits, foraging amongst a diverse range of habitat.

The members of the genus &quot;Ctenotus&quot; are widely distributed, in all states of Australia, and are especially diverse in arid regions and the tropical north, accounting for 10–20% of the lizard species. Around a quarter of lizards found in one area of the Great Sandy Desert are &quot;Ctenotus&quot; skinks, 11 of the 40 species. A single dune may have up to six species of &quot;Ctenotus&quot;. The Southwest Australian region contains 23 species. The size ranges from very small to moderately large, being similarly varied in body types from slender to stout. The diversity of forms allows species to occupy different niches, often in the same locality.

==Species==
&quot;Ctenotus&quot; is the most diverse reptile genus in Australia, with approximately 100 member species. Identification to the rank of species is regarded as difficult, and the largest lizard genus is also one of the most poorly understood.

<text>Montgomeryshire ( meaning &quot;the Shire of Baldwin&#x27;s town&quot;) was one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales. It was named after its county town, Montgomery, which in turn was named after one of William the Conqueror&#x27;s main counsellors, Roger de Montgomerie, who was the 1st Earl of Shrewsbury.

The area of what was Montgomeryshire, now constitutes the northern part of the principal area of Powys. The current area was 2,174 square km (839 square miles).

The largest town was Newtown, followed by Welshpool and Llanidloes.

==History==

The Treaty of Montgomery was signed on 29 September 1267, in the town of Montgomery, which had recently been established as an English incursion on the Welsh side of the border, to control a strategic border crossing. The surrounding region (on the Welsh side of the border) otherwise comprised the mediaeval principality of Powys Wenwynwyn, the southern of the two states into which the Kingdom of Powys had been divided a century before.

Attacks by Gwynedd on Powys Wenwynwyn led the latter to seek the assistance of the English. Ultimately this led them to convert their territory into a marcher lordship, via &quot;surrender and regrant&quot;, as a way to strengthen their position; the ruling princes of Powys Wenwynwyn became the &quot;Lords of Powys&quot;, feudally bound to the English king, and able to fully rely on English backing, but otherwise independent. The prince took an English-style surname - Owen de-la Pole - after his capital city, Pool (now Welshpool).

With the introduction of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 the marcher lordships were converted into English counties. The Lordship of Powys – the former Powys Wenwynwyn – became Montgomeryshire; the county town being Montgomery, the strongest centre of English authority in the region, rather than centre of Welsh authority, Welshpool. Montgomeryshire was thus ultimately formed from the &quot;cantrefi&quot; of Powys Wenwynwyn:
* Y Fyrnwy (commotes of Mochnant Uwch Rhaeadr, Mechain Is Coed and Llanerch Hudol)
* Llyswynaf (commotes of Caereinion and Mechain Uwch Coed)
* Ystlyg (commotes of Deuddwr, Ystrad Marchell and Y Gorddwr Isaf)
* Cedewain (commotes of Cynan, Cyfeiliog and Mawddwy)
* Arwystli (commotes of Arwystli Is Coed and Arwystli Uwch Coed)

In addition, for practical reasons, Montgomeryshire gained the commote of Ceri, which had formed a northwards spur of the less organised region Between Wye and Severn; most of the rest of the latter region became Radnorshire.

Montgomeryshire was bordered, to the north, by Denbighshire, to the east and south east by Shropshire, to the south by Radnorshire, to the south west by Cardiganshire, and to the west and north west by Merionethshire. When, in subsequent centuries, the concept of &quot;Wales&quot; was once again officially distinguished from &quot;England&quot;, all of these counties were deemed &quot;Welsh&quot;, except for Shropshire.
Montgomeryshire was the birthplace of Welsh Catholic martyr Saint Richard Gwyn (in 1537).

===Local government===

Elected county councils were established in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888 to take over the local government functions previously exercised by the quarter sessions. Although the county was named after Montgomery, by 1889 the quarter sessions were instead held at both Newtown and Welshpool, and the new county council chose to continue meeting in both towns in its early years. Montgomeryshire County Council held its first formal meeting on 1 April 1889 at the Public Rooms (also known as the Flannel Exchange) in Newtown.

In 1931 the county council opened a new headquarters building in Welshpool, called the Montgomeryshire County Offices or Neuadd Maldwyn. The county council remained based at Neuadd Maldwyn until its abolition in 1974.

Until 1974, Montgomeryshire was divided into civil parishes for the purpose of local government; these in large part equated to ecclesiastical parishes (see the table below), most of which still exist as part of the Church in Wales.

Local government reforms in 1974 combined the administrative areas of Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire and Brecknockshire together to form a new administrative county called Powys. A new district of Montgomeryshire was established as a lower-tier district authority within Powys, with the district&#x27;s area matching the former administrative county. The district council took over Neuadd Maldwyn in Welshpool to serve as its headquarters, and also retained the former offices of the abolished Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn Urban District Council at Newtown Hall Park as an area office.

Further local government reform in 1996 abolished district councils in Wales, making Powys a unitary authority. From 1996 until 2018 Powys County Council had a Montgomeryshire area committee covering the former Montgomeryshire district plus three communities formerly in the Glyndŵr district of Clwyd (historically Denbighshire) which were transferred to Powys in 1996. The three area committees for the former counties were abolished in 2018.

==Geography==
The area of what was Montogmeryshire was almost wholly mountainous, although there are some fertile valleys in the east. The highest point (county top) was Moel Sych at , whose summit lies at the triple county boundary point of Montgomeryshire, Denbighshire and Merionethshire in the Berwyn Mountains. The county top of Denbighshire, Cadair Berwyn at , was less than a kilometre away. Its main rivers were the River Severn (which flows east into Shropshire) and the River Dyfi (which flows west into the Irish Sea). Lake Vyrnwy is a reservoir supplying Liverpool.

The main towns were Machynlleth, Llanidloes, Montgomery, Newtown and Welshpool. The main industries were agriculture (mainly hill farming) and tourism, though there was also some forestry and light manufacturing. The population density was highest near the border with England and along the Severn valley. The county was closely linked to Shropshire, with many essential services for Montgomeryshire residents being located in the more densely populated town of Shrewsbury, such as acute health services at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital.

The county flower of Montgomeryshire remains the &quot;Spergula arvensis&quot; (also called &quot;corn spurrey&quot;). The shire forms a vice-county for wildlife recording.

==Transport==
Montgomeryshire was crossed from East to West by the Cambrian Line, a mainline passenger railway which runs between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth as well as Pwllheli with stations at Welshpool, Newtown, Caersws and Machynlleth.

The Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway links Welshpool to Llanfair Caereinion.

<doc id="341182" wikidata="Q609316" url="?curid=341182" title="Keye Luke">
<text>Keye Luke (; June 18, 1904 – January 12, 1991) was a Chinese-born American actor, and a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild. He portrayed Lee Chan, the &quot;Number One Son&quot; in the Charlie Chan films, the original Kato in the 1939–1941 &quot;Green Hornet&quot; film serials, Brak in the 1960s &quot;Space Ghost&quot; cartoons, Master Po in the television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, and Mr. Wing in the &quot;Gremlins&quot; films. He was the first Chinese-American contract player signed by RKO, Universal Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was one of the most prominent Asian actors of American cinema in the mid-20th century.

==Early life==
Luke was born in Canton (Guangzhou), China, then in the Qing Dynasty. His father, Lee Luke, was born in San Francisco in 1880, and traveled to China several times where he married Keye&#x27;s mother, Down Cook. Lee Luke established an art/import shop in Seattle Chinatown. Luke was raised in Seattle. He had four siblings who all moved from Seattle to California during the Great Depression. His younger brother Edwin Luke also became an actor in the Charlie Chan series. The Luke family included Washington assistant attorney-general Wing Luke.

In Seattle, Luke attended Franklin High School, where he contributed cartoons and illustrations to school publications. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1944.

==Artist==
Before becoming an actor, he was an artist in Seattle and, later, Hollywood. Luke worked on several of the murals inside Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. He did some of the original artwork for the pressbook of the original &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). Luke also painted a mural for the casino set in &quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot; (1941).

He published a limited edition set of pen and ink drawings of the &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot; in the 1950s. He also created illustrations for the books &quot;The Unfinished Song of Achmed Mohammed&quot; by Earle Liederman, &quot;Blessed Mother Goose&quot; by Frank Scully and an edition of &quot;Messer Marco Polo&quot; by Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne (unpublished). Other artwork completed by Luke included the dust jackets for books published in the 1950s and 1960s. It was through his studio art work that he was recruited for his earliest movie roles.

==Acting career==
Luke made his film debut for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; (1934), and played his first major role, as Charlie Chan&#x27;s eldest son, Lee Chan (called &quot;Number One Son by his father) in &quot;Charlie Chan in Paris&quot; (1935). He became a regular in the series where Lee alternately helped and distracted his father in each of his murder cases. Lee is culturally American and was an Olympic Gold Medalist in 100-metre swimming in &quot;Charlie Chan at the Olympics&quot; (1937). Luke appeared seven times as Lee Chan opposite Warner Oland&#x27;s Charlie Chan. He left the Charlie Chan series in 1938, shortly after Oland died. The unfinished Oland-Luke film &quot;Charlie Chan at the Ringside&quot; was completed as &quot;Mr. Moto&#x27;s Gamble&quot; (1938), with Luke now opposite Peter Lorre.

Luke worked prolifically with several Hollywood studios. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast him in a recurring role in its &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; film series, and Monogram Pictures featured him in its Frankie Darro comedies and starred him as Mr. Wong in &quot;Phantom of Chinatown&quot;. Unlike Boris Karloff, who preceded him in the Mr. Wong role, Luke played the detective without any exotic touches. His Mr. Wong, of Chinese descent and able to speak Chinese, was otherwise an ordinary American detective with no trace of a foreign accent.

RKO Radio Pictures used Luke in its &quot;The Falcon&quot; series and &quot;Mexican Spitfire&quot;. Luke also worked at Universal Pictures, where he played the valet/chauffeur Kato, the title character&#x27;s sidekick in its &quot;Green Hornet&quot; serials. Universal mounted a low-budget serial consisting largely of action footage from older films; Luke was hired to match old footage of Sabu in the serial &quot;Lost City of the Jungle&quot; (1946).

Luke returned to the Chan mysteries, which were then being produced by Monogram and starred Roland Winters as Chan. &quot;Number One Son&quot; appeared in the last two Chan features, &quot;The Feathered Serpent&quot; (1948), along with &quot;Number Two Son&quot; Tommy Chan (Victor Sen Yung) in their only appearance together, and &quot;Sky Dragon&quot; (1949). In both of these films, Luke was older than the actor playing his father. Luke had a featured Broadway role in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, directed by Gene Kelly in 1958. In the original cast album he sang the part of Mr. Wang, the family patriarch.

Luke continued to play character parts in motion pictures. He had a featured role in &quot;The Chairman&quot; (1969) starring Gregory Peck. He dubbed the voice of the evil Mr. Han (played by Shih Kien) in &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973) starring Bruce Lee. Luke played the mysterious old Chinatown shopowner Mr. Wing in the two &quot;Gremlins&quot; movies and he had a significant role in Woody Allen&#x27;s movie &quot;Alice&quot; (1990).

Luke also worked extensively in television, making numerous guest appearances, including four on &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; and seven TV movies. He was a regular cast member in two short lived sitcoms, &quot;Anna and the King&quot; (1972) starring Yul Brynner and &quot;Sidekicks&quot; (TV 1986–87). He appeared as Lin Fong (a jade merchant) in an episode of &quot;Dragnet 1967&quot;.

In 1972, he played the voice of Charlie Chan, in the animated television series &quot;The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan&quot; (1972-73), becoming the first actor of Chinese descent to play the role. He voiced other animated characters including Brak in &quot;Space Ghost&quot; (1966-68) and Zoltar/The Great Spirit/Colonel Cronus in &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; (1978-80).

Luke played Master Po in the television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (1972–1975). In 1985, Luke appeared as &quot;The Ancient One&quot; in the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, for the Asian Quarter storyline, which showcased Luke and young actress Kimberly McCullough, whom he mentored. In 1986 Luke appeared in season two of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; as Sophia&#x27;s love interest. He played two separate roles in the sitcom &quot;Night Court&quot;, first as a defendant and later as Mac Robinson&#x27;s grandfather-in-law.

Luke played Governor Donald Cory in episode 71 of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; entitled &quot;Whom Gods Destroy (1969), and was originally cast as Doctor Noonien Soong in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Brothers&quot;; Brent Spiner ultimately took over the role after Luke became ill.

<text>Miriam&#x27;s skink (Brachymeles miriamae) is a skink, a lizard in the family Scincidae. The species is endemic to Thailand.

==Taxonomy==
In 1972 described Miriam&#x27;s skink as a new species in a new genus, giving it the scientific name &quot;Davewakeum miriamae&quot;. In 2011 et al. included the genus &quot;Davewakeum&quot; in the genus &quot;Brachymeles&quot;, creating the new combination, &quot;Brachymeles miriamae&quot; . In 2015 et al. returned the species to the genus &quot;Davewakeum&quot;.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;miriamae&quot;, is in honor of Miriam Heyer, who collected the holotype, and is the wife of American herpetologist W. Ronald Heyer.

The generic name, &quot;Davewakeum&quot;, is in honor of American herpetologist David B. Wake.

==Geographic range==
Miriam&#x27;s skink is found in Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Thailand.

==Description==

It covered a sparsely populated area, and was bounded to the north by Montgomeryshire and Shropshire, to the east by Herefordshire, to the south by Brecknockshire and to the west by Cardiganshire.

The county was formed in 1536 from several Marcher lordships under the Laws in Wales Acts, as part of the formal annexation of Wales into the Kingdom of England by Henry VIII. The county was named after New Radnor, which was the original county town. From 1543 onwards the assizes were held alternately at New Radnor and Presteigne, later settling at Presteigne alone. Presteigne then served as the county&#x27;s administrative centre until 1889 when Radnorshire County Council was established and chose to base itself in Llandrindod Wells instead.

The administrative county was abolished in 1974, with the area becoming the lower-tier Radnor district within the new county of Powys. The district was renamed Radnorshire in 1989. Radnorshire District Council was abolished in 1996 when Powys became a unitary authority. Powys County Council then had a Radnorshire &quot;shire committee&quot; until 2018.

The largest town in Radnorshire was Llandrindod Wells, with other towns being Knighton, Presteigne, and Rhayader. The Radnor Forest is an area of high ground covering a large part of the east of former county.

==History==
The geographic territory of what was Radnorshire roughly corresponds with the Welsh territory of Rhwng Gwy a Hafren () which fell under the control of the Marcher Lords at the end of the 11th century. The area that would become Radnorshire included Cwmhir Abbey, a Cistercian monastery founded in 1176 at Abbeycwmhir. The Battle of Bryn Glas was fought on 22 June 1402 at Pilleth during the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr.

Until the Laws in Wales Act 1535, Radnor was outside the Principality of Wales. This peculiar Marcher status and its want of Welsh speakers gave weight to the traditional local expression, &quot;Neither Wales nor England, just Radnorsheer&quot;

The 1535 act created Radnorshire from a number of former territories, including the cantrefs of Maelienydd and Elfael and the commotes of Gwrtheyrnion and Deuddwr. The act also specified that New Radnor was the county town, and directed that the county&#x27;s assizes and quarter sessions should be held alternately at New Radnor and Rhayader. A judge was murdered at Rhayader a few years later, highlighting the dangers to English judges in that part of the county. In 1543 the law was changed, directing that the assizes should no longer be held at Rhayader, but should instead alternate between New Radnor and Presteigne. The practice of holding sessions alternately at New Radnor and Presteigne later gave way to all sessions being held at Presteigne.

The county&#x27;s poverty was remarked upon thus in the 17th century by an anonymous visitor:
Apart from a handful of parishes along the English border the Welsh language remained the first language of the county well into the second half of the eighteenth century. By 1850 the language had retreated to the western parishes of Rhayader, Llanyre, Cwmdauddwr, St Harmon and Nantmel. By 1900 Welsh was still spoken by a sizeable minority west of the town of Rhayader, the language disappearing as the century progressed. Of course there were Welsh speakers living in Radnorshire who had come from other parts of Wales, and today their number has been swollen by children being educated through the medium of Welsh in school.

When elected county councils were established in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, taking over the local government functions of the old court of quarter sessions, the new Radnorshire County Council decided to meet at Llandrindod Wells rather than Presteigne. The county council was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972.

The area became the lower-tier Radnor district within the new county of Powys. The district was renamed Radnorshire in 1989. Radnorshire District Council was abolished in 1996 when Powys became a unitary authority. Powys County Council then had a Radnorshire &quot;shire committee&quot; comprising the Powys councillors elected from the wards covering the former Radnorshire district from 1996 until the county council abolished its shire committees in 2018.

==Geography==
In the east and south were some comparatively level tracts, including the Vale of Radnor, but much of the county is forest, moorland and low mountains, with the Cambrian Mountains running through the west of the county beyond Rhayader. The Radnor Forest is a slightly isolated dome of hills in the middle of the county near the village of New Radnor, and included what was the highest ground in the former county. Here is found the former county top of Great Rhos, at a height of above sea level. The Elan Valley contains several huge man-made reservoirs supplying water to Birmingham. The main rivers were the Wye, the Teme, the Elan and the Ithon. The Teme formed the boundary with Shropshire.

The chief towns were Knighton, Llandrindod Wells, Presteigne and Rhayader. The backbone of local incomes was tourism, hill farming and the public sector such as care, education and road/public land maintenance. Sheep, dairy/cattle and poultry farming provided more revenue than crops which like much of Scotland, the Pennines and Wales received more than national average precipitation and can be subject to late frosts.

==Governance==
===Constituencies===
From 1542 there was a Radnorshire constituency for electing members of parliament to the English (and later United Kingdom) parliament. The constituency was abolished in 1918, merging with the neighbouring Breconshire constituency to become the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency. Brecon and Radnorshire is also the name of the Senedd constituency covering the area.

===Local government subdivisions===
====Hundreds====
On the creation of the county it was divided into six hundreds. The names of the hundreds, which were not always consistently spelt, were as follows:

*Colwyn
*Cefnllys (Kevenlleece or Cevnllŷs)
*Knighton
*Painscastle
*Radnor
*Rhaiadr (or Rhayader)

====Poor law unions====
In the 19th century new structures of local administration were introduced. The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 grouped parishes into poor law unions. While these were not themselves local authorities, their boundaries were to later be used to define local government districts. PLUs did not conform to county boundaries, but consisted of catchment areas for workhouses. Most of Radnorshire was included in the three unions of Knighton, Presteigne and Rhayader. Parishes on the edges of the county were included in unions based in other counties: Builth and Hay on Wye in Brecknockshire and Kington in Herefordshire.

====Local boards of health====
There were no town councils in the county until 1850, when a local board was formed at Knighton. Similar bodies were later formed at Llandrindod Wells (originally named Trefonen) and Presteigne in 1891.

====Sanitary districts====
The Public Health Act 1875 divided England and Wales into sanitary districts, each governed by a sanitary authority. Instead of creating new bodies, existing local board districts became urban sanitary districts (USDs) and the remaining areas of poor law unions became rural sanitary districts (RSDs). The existing local board or poor law guardians became the sanitary authority for their area. By 1891 therefore, Radnorshire was divided between the following sanitary districts:
*Builth RSD (part)
*Hay RSD (part)
*Kington RSD (Part)
*Knighton RSD
*Knighton USD
*Llandrindod Wells USD
*Presteigne RSD (dissolved in 1877, with parishes redistributed to Kington and Knighton RSDs)
*Presteigne USD
*Rhayader RSD

====Urban and rural districts====
The Local Government Act 1894 created urban districts (UDs) and rural districts (RDs) in place of the sanitary districts. Directly elected urban and rural district councils became the governing bodies. The new districts were identical to the sanitary districts, with the exception that where a RSD was divided by a county boundary it was split into separate rural district in each county. Radnorshire was divided into eight UDs and RDs, which were unchanged until their abolition in 1974:

*Colwyn RD (from Builth RSD)
*Knighton RD
*Knighton UD
*Llandrindod Wells UD
*New Radnor RD (from Kington RSD)
*Painscastle RD (from Hay RSD)
*Presteigne UD
*Rhayader RD

==== Civil parishes ====
From the medieval period until 1974, Radnorshire was divided into civil parishes for the purpose of local government; these in large part equated to ecclesiastical parishes (see the table below), most of which still exist as part of the Church in Wales. Chapelries are listed in &quot;italics&quot;.
===Premises===

Prior to the creation of Radnorshire County Council in 1889, the county was administered by its court of quarter sessions, which initially alternated between New Radnor and Rhayader, then between New Radnor and Presteigne, before settling at Presteigne alone. A Shire Hall was built in Presteigne in 1542 and rebuilt in 1829, which served as the main administrative building for the county. When the county council was established, during preliminary meetings before the council formally came into being on 1 April 1889, it was decided by 12 votes to 11 that the county council would not meet at Presteigne but in Llandrindod Wells. The Shire Hall in Presteigne continued to serve as a courthouse until the 1990s.
The county council generally held its meetings at the Pump House Hotel on Spa Road East in Llandrindod Wells. In 1909 the county council built itself offices at the &quot;County Buildings&quot; in the High Street at Llandrindod Wells.
The county council then moved its staff to larger offices at the former Gwalia Hotel in Ithon Road in 1950. The former hotel remained the county council headquarters until the county council was abolished in 1974.
The district council was based at The Gwalia, on Ithon Road in Llandrindod Wells, which had been built in 1900 as the Gwalia Hotel and had served as the offices of the old Radnorshire County Council since 1950. After the council&#x27;s abolition The Gwalia became an area office for Powys County Council.

==Coat of arms==
Until 1954 Radnorshire County Council used a version of the arms of the Mortimers, Earls of March: &quot;Barry of six or and azure on a chief of the last two pallets azure between as may gyrons of the first&quot;. The council received a grant of armorial bearings by the College of Arms in 1954. The arms were made up of &quot;charges&quot; from local families. A gold reguardant lion on red was for Elystan Glodrhydd, Prince of Wales c. 1000; black boars&#x27; heads on white for his son Cadwgan. Around these was placed a gold and blue &quot;compony bordure&quot; based on the Mortimer arms. The motto adopted by the county council was &quot;&quot; (&quot;Go Higher&quot;). In 1974 the arms were transferred to Radnor District Council. In 1996 the arms were transferred a second time to Powys County Council, for use by the Radnorshire Shire Committee.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. A majority of the seats on the council were held by independents throughout the council&#x27;s existence.

==Radnorshire Diaspora==

Poverty and agricultural change, decline and industrial progress elsewhere has always made Radnorshire a place of net emigration. Emigrants employed the name of the county in the United States:
*Radnor Lake State Park, Nashville, Tennessee
*Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Part of the Welsh Tract first settled in 1682–1685 by a group of 40 Quakers from Radnorshire.
*Radnor Township, Delaware County, Ohio
Others may have formed part of the Welsh community in Patagonia.

<doc id="341187" wikidata="Q143734" url="?curid=341187" title="Egernia">
<text>Egernia is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae) that occurs in Australia. These skinks are ecologically diverse omnivores that inhabit a wide range of habitats. However, in the loose delimitation (which incorporates about 30 species) the genus is not monophyletic but an evolutionary grade, as has long been suspected due to its lack of characteristic apomorphies.

Some of the skinks traditionally placed in &quot;Egernia&quot; appear to be among the most intelligent squamates. They have been shown to be able to distinguish between relatives and unrelated conspecifics, and can recognize relatives individually. Several species form monogamous pair-bonds. For instance, the black rock skink is a species who can perform kin discrimination based on scent and form monogamous pair-bonds and a nuclear family structure. Most of these species belong to &quot;Egernia sensu stricto&quot;, and similar behaviour is also known in the related Solomon Islands skink (&quot;Corucia zebrata&quot;). The latter means that the high intelligence and social skills are probably plesiomorphic for the &quot;Egernia&quot; genus-group as a whole, and that the solitary species appear to have evolved towards being less intelligent and social again. It may still be, however, that the intelligent behaviour is a homoplasy that evolved several times in the &quot;Egernia&quot; genus-group; the fact that &quot;Corucia&quot; is a monotypic and rather distinct genus makes it impossible to decide at present.

==Systematics, taxonomy and evolution==
It is the namesake genus of the &quot;Egernia&quot; genus-group, which also includes the Solomon Islands skink (&quot;Corucia&quot;), &quot;Cyclodomorphus&quot; and the blue-tongued skinks (&quot;Tiliqua&quot;). In some older works, it is considered closely related to &quot;Mabuya&quot;, but even among the subfamily Lygosominae this genus does not seem to be particularly closely related and would—were the genus-groups treated at the rarely used rank of infrafamily—certainly constitute an infrafamily of its own. On the other hand, the enigmatic crocodile skinks (&quot;Tribolonotus&quot;) might be a very basal member of the &quot;Egernia&quot; genus-group.

The genus &quot;Egernia&quot; proper, as well as the other lineages, appear to be of Miocene—probably Early Miocene—origin, meaning they radiated at least 15, maybe 20 million years ago (mya). There are fossils of &quot;Egernia&quot;-like Lygosominae from around the Oligocene-Miocene boundary 23 mya, but these cannot be assigned to the present genus with certainty. Rather, they appear to be basal members of the &quot;Egernia&quot; genus-group, still very plesiomorphic Lygosominae with a habitus similar to &quot;Mabuya&quot;.

==Species==

&quot;Egernia&quot; species are mid-sized to large skinks, adult snout-to-vent length (SVL) , with a bulky, usually somewhat flattened body and small eyes. They have 24–46 rows of midbody scales, and the dorsal scales are smooth, ridged, keeled or spiny (the tail is often notably spiny). The nasal scale has a postnarial groove; the subocular scale row is incomplete. The eyelids are similar in colour to the adjacent scales.

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Egernia&quot;.

===Fossils===
* &quot;Egernia gillespieae&quot; 

===Splitting &quot;Egernia&quot; in four===
Cladistic analysis of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4, 12S rRNA, &quot;c-mos&quot; and β-fibrinogen intron 7 DNA sequence data delimits 3 clades, &quot;Bellatorias&quot;, &quot;Liopholis&quot;, and &quot;Lissolepis&quot; in &quot;Egernia sensu lato&quot;, which are best regarded as separate genera — as had already been often proposed in former times, as early as the 19th century.

<text>Eugongylus is a genus of skinks in the subfamily Eugongylinae. It was previously recognised as namesake of the &quot;Eugonglyus&quot; group of genera within Lygosominae, where it occupied a quite basal position. Members of this genus are commonly called mastiff skinks or short-legged giant skinks.

==Species==
The following species are recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Eugongylus albofasciolatus&quot; – white-banded mastiff skink, white-banded giant skink, white-striped cape skink, barred shark skink
*&quot;Eugongylus mentovarius&quot; – odd-chinned mastiff skink, odd-chinned giant skink

<text>Eulamprus is a genus of lizards, commonly known as water skinks, in the subfamily Sphenomorphinae of the family Scincidae. The genus is native to Australia.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Eulamprus&quot; belongs to a clade in the &quot;Sphenomorphus&quot; group that contains other genera such as &quot;Ctenotus&quot; and &quot;Anomalopus&quot;. The molecular phylogenetic studies of O&#x27;Connor and (2003) and et al. (2013) found that species assigned to &quot;Eulamprus&quot; comprised four independent lineages within the Australian &quot;Sphenomorphus&quot; group and did not form a clade. The genus &quot;Eulamprus&quot; was restricted to the water skinks, with other species assigned to &quot;Concinnia&quot; (including species formerly in the monotypic genera &quot;Gnypetoscincus&quot; and &quot;Nangura&quot;), &quot;Silvascincus&quot; and &quot;Tumbunascincus&quot;.

==Species==
The following five species are recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Eulamprus heatwolei&quot; – warm-temperate water-skink, Heatwole&#x27;s water skink
*&quot;Eulamprus kosciuskoi&quot; – alpine meadow-skink, alpine water skink
*&quot;Eulamprus leuraensis&quot; – Blue Mountains water skink, Blue Mountain swamp-skink
*&quot;Eulamprus quoyii&quot; – golden water skink, eastern water-skink, eastern water skink
*&quot;Eulamprus tympanum&quot; – southern water skink, cool-temperate water-skink, highland water skink, Dreeite water skink

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Eulamprus&quot;.

==Species formerly placed in &quot;Eulamprus&quot;==
*&quot;Concinnia ampla&quot; – lemon-barred forest-skink
*&quot;Concinnia brachyosoma&quot; – northern barsided skink
*&quot;Concinnia frerei&quot; – stout barsided skink
*&quot;Concinnia martini&quot; – dark barsided skink
*&quot;Concinnia sokosoma&quot; – stout barsided skink
*&quot;Concinnia tenuis&quot; bar-sided forest-skink, barred-sided skink
*&quot;Concinnia tigrina&quot; – yellow-blotched forest-skink, rainforest water-skink
*&quot;Silvascincus murrayi&quot; – blue-speckled forest-skink
*&quot;Silvascincus tryoni&quot; – Border Ranges blue-spectacled skink, forest skink, Tryon&#x27;s skink
*&quot;Tumbunascincus luteilateralis&quot; – orange-speckled forest-skink

<text>The genus Eumeces (family Scincidae) comprises four African to Middle-Eastern skink species.

==Systematics==
Recently two taxonomic revisions have been made regarding the 19th century genus &quot;Eumeces&quot;. They both resulted in similar results; the genus is paraphyletic and must be &quot;sliced up&quot; into several different genera. Griffith &quot;et al.&quot; (2000) proposed that the type species for &quot;Eumeces&quot;, &quot;E. pavimentatus&quot;, which is considered by many to be a subspecies of &quot;Eumeces schneiderii&quot;, should be changed to &quot;Lacerta fasciata&quot;, so that the genus name &quot;Eumeces&quot; would stay with the most species-rich clade. However, this petition has not been verified by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Schimtz &quot;et al.&quot; argued that Griffith &quot;et al.&quot; violated the Code and rejected the proposal on good grounds. Thus only the African species of the &quot;Eumeces schneiderii&quot; group belong to the genus &quot;Eumeces&quot;.

Within &quot;Eumeces&quot; the following species are recognized: 
*&quot;Eumeces algeriensis&quot; – Algerian skink
*&quot;Eumeces blythianus&quot; – Blyth&#x27;s skink
*&quot;Eumeces cholistanensis&quot;
*&quot;Eumeces indothalensis&quot; – striped mole skink
*&quot;Eumeces persicus&quot; – Persian striped skink
*&quot;Eumeces schneiderii&quot; – Schneider&#x27;s skink
*&quot;Eumeces zarudnyi&quot;
Some species that were formerly considered &quot;Eumeces&quot; have now been assigned to new genera:

<doc id="341195" wikidata="Q15177526" url="?curid=341195" title="Euprepis">
<text>Euprepis is an obsolete genus of skinks in the subfamily Lygosominae. It was named by Wagler in 1830 and frequently used in subsequent years, often misspelled as Euprepes, a misspelling introduced by Wiegmann in 1834. It was then subsumed under the large skink genus &quot;Mabuya&quot;, until Mausfeld and others resurrected it for a group of mainly African skinks they split from &quot;Mabuya&quot;. The following year, Bauer argued that this assignment had been in error and that this group should be called &quot;Trachylepis&quot; instead. &quot;Euprepis&quot; itself is a junior synonym of &quot;Mabuya&quot;.

==Type species==
The identity of the type species, the name-bearing type which determines the application of a generic name, of &quot;Euprepis&quot; has been in some recent dispute. In 1830, Wagler included several species in &quot;Euprepis&quot;: &quot;Lacerta punctata&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 (=&quot;Lygosoma punctatum&quot;), &quot;Scincus multifasciatus&quot; Kuhl, 1820, &quot;Scincus trilineatus&quot; Schneider, 1801, &quot;Scincus quinquetaeniatus&quot; Lichtenstein, 1823, &quot;Scincus agilis&quot; Raddi, 1823 (=&quot;Mabuya agilis&quot;), &quot;Lacerta fasciata&quot; Linnaeus, 1758, &quot;Lacerta quinquelineata&quot; Linnaeus, 1758, &quot;Scincus tristatus&quot; Daudin, 1802, and &quot;Scincus Sloanei&quot; Daudin, 1802, but he did not select a type species. Subsequently, Fitzinger selected &quot;Eumeces mabouia&quot; (=&quot;Mabuya mabouya&quot;) as the type species, but his designation is invalid because Wagler did not include this species in his original concept of the genus. In 1957, Loveridge selected &quot;Scincus agilis&quot; (=&quot;Mabuya agilis&quot;) as the type species from among the species Wagler had included as the type species, and in 1970 Peters and Donoso-Barros listed, without comment, &quot;Lacerta punctata&quot; Linnaeus (=&quot;Lygosoma punctatum&quot;) as the type species. When Mausfeld and others split &quot;Mabuya&quot; in 2002, they resurrected &quot;Euprepis&quot; for the group including African and Malagasy species and the Noronha skink and also listed &quot;Lacerta punctata&quot; as the type species, considering all previous type designations invalid. In 2003, Bauer argued that the earliest type species designation is valid, so the type species of &quot;Euprepis&quot; is &quot;Scincus agilis&quot;, a member of &quot;Mabuya&quot; as restricted by Mausfeld and others in 2002 (including only American species), making &quot;Euprepis&quot; a junior synonym of &quot;Mabuya&quot;. Bauer also argued that &quot;Lacerta punctata&quot; did not apply to a species of the African &quot;Mabuya&quot; group, as Mausfeld and others had assumed, but rather to the Asian species &quot;Lygosoma punctatum&quot;.

==Species==
Among the species previously included in &quot;Euprepis&quot; or &quot;Euprepes&quot; are the following:
*&quot;Euprepis atlanticus&quot;: – currently &quot;Trachylepis atlantica&quot;
*&quot;Euprepes chaperi&quot; – currently &quot;Lygosoma sundevalli&quot;
*&quot;Euprepis punctatus&quot;: – currently &quot;Trachylepis atlantica&quot;

<text>Feylinia is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae). It is usually placed in the monotypic subfamily Feylininae.

However, it appears to be not as distinct as formerly presumed, but rather somewhat closer to such genera as &quot;Chalcides&quot; and &quot;Sepsina&quot;. These are usually placed in the subfamily Scincinae, which seems to be paraphyletic however.

&quot;Feylinia&quot; belongs to a major clade which does not seem to include the Scincinae type genus &quot;Scincus&quot;. Thus, it will probably be eventually assigned to a new, yet-to-be-named subfamily. (Austin &amp; Arnold 2006)

==Species==
The following six species are recognized.
*&quot;Feylinia boulengeri&quot; 
*&quot;Feylinia currori&quot; - western forest feylinia
*&quot;Feylinia elegans&quot; - elegant feylinia
*&quot;Feylinia grandisquamis&quot; - large-scaled burrowing skink

<text>The prickly skink, or prickly forest skink (Gnypetoscincus queenslandiae), is a morphologically and genetically distinctive species of skink endemic to rainforests of the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area, in north-eastern Australia. Unlike most small skinks, which have smooth scales, this species has rough, ridged and pointed scales. These keeled scales may be an adaptation to its high-rainfall habitat, to its microhabitat in rotting logs, or to camouflage it when moving through forest leaf-litter.

==Taxonomy==
This species is a member of the Australian &quot;Sphenomorphid&quot; group of skinks (family Scincidae), which includes such genera as &quot;Ctenotus&quot;, &quot;Anomalopus&quot; and &quot;Eulamprus&quot;. It is monotypic in the genus &quot;Gnypetoscincus&quot;.

==Distribution and life History==
The prickly skink is a habitat specialist restricted to closed canopy forest in high rainfall areas (rainforests) of the Australian Wet Tropics, extending from lowland tropical rainforest to montane forests on the adjacent hills and tablelands. Within these rainforests the prickly skink occurs within rotting logs and leaf litter and although locally abundant in some areas, it is rarely seen without searching. This is a well buffered environment with very low seasonality. This species is ovoviviparous, and despite living in an equable climate, reproduction is seasonal, with females giving birth to 2-5 young in February - April. Animals mature at a snout-vent length (SVL) of around and grow to a maximum SVL of , with no obvious difference in external morphology or size between females and males. A skeletochronological study suggested that this corresponds with an age of 5 years at maturity and a maximum life-span around 10 years. Unlike most skinks this is a vocal species with high-pitched but audible calls recorded in the field and in captivity, associated with handling and with aggressive interactions among females.

==Phylogeography and Population Biology==
Extensive upland areas of the Australian Wet Tropics, such as the Atherton Tableland, were cleared for farming, largely between 1940 and 1990, leaving many scattered pockets of rainforest surrounded by open pasture. The prickly skink is abundant throughout this area and has become a research subject for studies on the effect of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity, gene flow and adaptation in a rainforest dependent species. A 1993 phylogeographic study by Moritz and co-authors using allozyme electrophoresis and restriction mapping of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes found distinct genetic lineages in populations from the northern and southern wet tropics. These areas are currently connected by a ribbon of rainforest habitat, around wide, known as the Black Mountain Corridor or BMC, but historical climate modeling suggest that rainforests in the northern and southern wet tropics were separated by around of dry habitats in this area during Pleistocene glacial climate periods. However, the deep divergence between these lineages suggests much longer genetic isolation, with an estimated separation time of over five million years, and these populations may represent different species. Further study of mtDNA and allozyme variation from sites around the Atherton Tablelands (within the Southern Lineage) revealed additional phylogeographic structure, with a divergence between populations around the Bellenden Ker / Wooroonooran Range, east of the Atherton Tableland, and those in the central and southern tablelands. The late-Pleistocene divergence between these lineages (&gt;0.5% across the mtDNA genome) is an order of magnitude less than that between the Northern and Southern Wet Tropics but is indicative of emergence from separate glacial refugia. The larger Wooroonooran refugium maintained higher diversity through the glacial period than the southern Tableland refugium and this natural historical difference in genetic diversity is much greater than any more recent, human induced, effects of forest clearing and fragmentation. More detailed study of genetic variation in populations from the Atherton tableland, using mtDNA sequences and microsatellite loci, revealed a slight reduction in allelic diversity and in the pattern of isolation by distance among populations. Also, Sumner found relatedness among males within fragments was lower in isolated forest fragments than within continuous forests, possibly reflecting greater dispersal within fragments due to lower habitat quality. However, these relatively slight differences show the difficulty of detecting effects of recent habitat fragmentation in a species with relatively low local population size and limited dispersal. Sumner and co-authors did find other ecological effects of fragmentation; skink abundance was higher in continuous forest sites than in fragments, and was lower in small habitat patches than in large patches, and on average, skinks from fragments were smaller than those from continuous forests. Estimates of population density and dispersal distances from capture-recapture methods and from genetic data are broadly consistent, with a density varying from 65 - 136 individuals per ha, and a dispersal distance of 404 – 843 m2, respectively. Genetic estimates of relatedness among individuals found under the same log revealed that juveniles tend to stay with their parents for 1–2 years and subsequently disperse to other logs, with marked individuals observed away from their initial capture site over three years.

<text>The earless skinks form the genus Hemiergis in the skink family Scincidae. All earless skinks are native to Australia. They are also called mulch skinks.

== Description ==
&quot;Hemiergis&quot; skinks are small, slender fossorial lizards with reduced limbs and varying numbers of digits. Depending on the species and population, individuals can have 2, 3, 4 or 5 fingers/toes.

Ventral surfaces are typically yellow to reddish orange. Snout-vent lengths range from 42 mm to 89 mm [cite Wilson and Swan]. Dorsal surfaces are typically brown and may have dark brown or black paravertebral or dorsolateral stripes.

Variation in digit number between species and populations of &quot;Hemiergis&quot; has been used to better understand the influence of the Sonic hedgehog (&quot;Shh&quot;) gene on embryonic development. For example, one study found a clear correlation between adult digit number and duration of the SHH protein expression early in limb development, with reduced expression of the SHH protein correlated with fewer digits.

&quot;Hemiergis&quot; means &#x27;half worker&#x27;, in reference to the short limbs that are characteristic of the genus.

&quot;Hemiergis&quot; is closely related to the other Australian skink genera &quot;Anomalopus&quot; and &quot;Eremiascincus.&quot;.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Hemiergis&quot; is an Australian genus, found across the southern end of the continent, with populations in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;Hemiergis&quot; are ovoviviparous, meaning the mother produces eggs which develop inside her and she gives birth to live young. This is common in southern Australian (cold climate) reptiles. Clutch sizes range from 1 to 6.

== Ecology and habitat ==
&quot;Hemiergis&quot; individuals are typically found dwelling in loose damp soil under logs, rocks and leaf litter.

Their diet consists of small invertebrates.

== Species ==
There are seven species:
* &quot;Hemiergis decresiensis&quot; — three-toed earless skink
* &quot;Hemiergis gracilipes&quot; — south-western mulch-skink
* &quot;Hemiergis initialis&quot; — southwestern earless skink
* &quot;Hemiergis millewae&quot; — Triodia earless skink
* &quot;Hemiergis peronii&quot; — four-toed earless skink, Peron&#x27;s earless skink, or lowlands earless skink
* &quot;Hemiergis quadrilineatus&quot; — two-toed earless skink
* &quot;Hemiergis talbingoensis&quot; — eastern three-toed earless skink

Two additional species, &quot;H. graciloides&quot; and &quot;H. maccoyi&quot;, have been included in this genus but both are now classified in other genera.

<text>The pink-tongued skink (&quot;Cyclodomorphus gerrardii)&quot; is a species of lizard in the family Scincidae. It is endemic to Australia, where it is also called commonly the pink-tongued lizard. As suggested by these common names, its distinguishing characteristic is a pink tongue as opposed to the blue tongue of lizards of the closely related genus &quot;Tiliqua&quot;.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;gerrardii&quot;, is in honor of British zoologist (1810–1910), who was Gray&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man&quot; at the British Museum.

==Geographic range==
&quot;C. gerrardii&quot; is endemic to Australia. It can be found from Springwood, New South Wales, along the eastern coastal country and eastern ranges to the Cairns Region, Queensland. 

==Description==

&quot;C. gerrardii&quot; is a relatively large lizard of up to total length (including tail). It has a slender body with a long, slender and slightly prehensile tail about the same length as the body. The limbs are well developed with long digits and sharp claws. The neck is well pronounced, and the head is relatively large, wider in males than in females. In adults the tongue is pink. &quot;C. gerrardii&quot; has a slate-grey to fawn dorsal ground colour with dark grey to brown or black cross bands. These bands are more pronounced in males and less so in females. There are about 20 cross bands from the neck to the tip of the tail, which run slightly backwards laterally. The ventral surfaces of &quot;C. gerrardii&quot; are white to pinkish or creamy brown and may be marbled on the cross bands. The scales are smooth and, on the head, edged with a darker colour. The tip of the snout is dark in adults with some darker spots on the head. The limbs are spotted or streaked darkly. All juveniles are marked with pronounced black cross bands on a very light grey ground colour. There are several dark spots on the head, especially under the eyes. The tip of the snout is light in colour and the tongue and mouth are blue. Similar species (Cogger 2000): &quot;C. gerrardii&quot; has been associated with the genus &quot;Tiliqua&quot; as well as the genus &quot;Cyclodomorphus&quot; due to their close relation (previous names: &quot;Cyclodomorphus gerrardii&quot; and &quot;Tiliqua gerrardii&quot;). &quot;C. gerrardii&quot; is very similar in appearance to the eastern blue-tongue, &quot;Tiliqua scincoides&quot;; however, &quot;C. gerrardii&quot; has, true to its common name, a pink tongue as an adult. It is also much more slender than &quot;T. scincoides&quot;, having a more slender body, a much longer and narrower tail as well as a smaller head. In addition, the limbs are more developed and longer than those of the blue-tongues.

==Ecology and behaviour==
&quot;C. gerrardii&quot; inhabits wet sclerophyll forests and rainforests as well as moist areas in woodlands. It shelters beneath leaf litter, in hollow logs, and in crevices of rocks and trees. Its slender body and limbs are an adaptation for moving in thick undergrowth. &quot;C. gerrardii&quot; moves with lateral undulations on smooth surfaces, but holds its hind limbs close to the body and moves its tail in a side-winding motion when moving through grass and when climbing on branches, using only the forelimbs. Its main diet consists of snails and slugs, for which it forages during twilight hours and at night in summer, and also during the day in cooler months. To crush the shells of snails, &quot;C. gerrardii&quot; uses its large and flattened teeth in the back of the upper and lower jaw. &quot;C. gerrardii&quot; is a good climber, using its semi-prehensile tail as a supporting aid and, although only partially arboreal, climbing trees to feed when necessary. The juveniles seem to climb vegetation more frequently to avoid predation. When threatened, &quot;C. gerrardii&quot; raises its body off the ground to appear larger, and flickers or vibrates its tongue rapidly similar to snakes. 

==Breeding biology==
In &quot;C. gerrardii&quot; courtship occurs in early spring for a period of six weeks, during which time males have been observed to fight. In mating, the male grasps the female&#x27;s head with his jaws and mounts her. After an estimated gestation period of 101 to 110 days, females produce large litters of 20 to 30 (largest recorded: 67) live-young in early summer. During birth, the female holds her hind legs close to her body, as when moving through grass, giving single births about every 30 minutes during which she moves around. The young are born curled up in a foetal membrane, which they eat after breaking free. Immediately after birth, the young start flickering their tongues. The tongue and mouth are dark blue and the ventral surface is black in juveniles, changing to pink and mauve respectively after about three months. The young are independent from straight after birth without any parental care and start feeding on slugs and snails. Age at sexual maturity is about 22 months.

<text>Janetaescincus is a genus of burrowing skinks in the family Scincidae. The genus is endemic to the Seychelles. There are two recognized species.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Janetaescincus&quot;, is in honor of Janet Greer, who is the younger of the two sisters of Australian herpetologist .

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Janetaescincus&quot; is usually placed in the subfamily Scincinae, which seems to be paraphyletic however. Probably quite close to &quot;Pamelaescincus gardineri&quot;, the genus &quot;Janetaescincus&quot; belongs to a major clade which does not seem to include the type genus &quot;Scincus&quot;. Thus, &quot;Janetaescincus&quot; will probably be eventually assigned to a new, yet-to-be-named subfamily. (Austin &amp; Arnold 2006)

==Species==
Two species are recognized as being valid.

*&quot;Janetaescincus braueri&quot; 
*&quot;Janetaescincus veseyfitzgeraldi&quot; 

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Janetaescincus&quot;.
